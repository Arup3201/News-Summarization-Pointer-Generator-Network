Tariq Khan failed to tell anyone that his little brother Hamzah had died

The eldest son of alcoholic child killer Amanda Hutton has apologised for his part in covering up the death of his four-year-old brother.

Tariq Khan failed to tell anyone that his little brother Hamzah had died of extreme neglect and malnutrition and he stayed quiet when the tiny boy's starved body lay mummified in his cot for two years.

The 24-year-old was in the house when Hamzah died but was a ‘mummy’s boy’, subjected to ‘emotional blackmail’ by her and feared for his siblings’ lives if he spoke out.

He claimed that his mother threatened to kill five of his brothers and sisters if he turned her in, holding a knife to one of the children's throats, and ‘threatening to burn the house down’ if he said anything about Hamzah’s death.

Hutton was jailed for 15 years at Bradford Crown Court, after being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence.

She had pleaded guilty to cruelty to five other children and failing to lawfully bury Hamzah’s body.

Khan, who also pleaded guilty to the burial offence, was given a two-year suspended sentence.

The Sunday Mirror reports that just moment after the trial, Khan sent a text to his father Aftab Khan, apologising for his part.

It said: 'Dad, I’m sorry if I’ve ever hurt you. Sorry if I’ve let you down.'

A two-week-long trial heard how 
Hamzah's decomposed body was discovered in a travel cot and covered with
insects in Hutton's bedroom at their filthy home.

He died in December 2009 due to malnutrition after his mother's addictions to alcohol and cannabis took over her life.

The estranged father - who was ordered to stay away from his wife in 2008 after admitting battering her - claims that he had approached social services with concerns about his children's safety, but that they had been ignored. 

He claims he then approached police and asked them to check on the children but officers found nothing of concern.

 Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton was found guilty of the manslaughter of her own son. Hamzah's decomposed body was found in his mother's Bradford home two years after he died in 2009

This is the home in which little Hamzah spent his short life before mother Hutton let him starve to death

The young child's body was found in a travel cot, under piles of clothes. He had wasted away to such an 
extent that when he died he was wearing baby clothes of a six to 
nine-month-old baby. 

Almost every room in the house was filled with 
mounds of plastic bags of household rubbish, bottles, used nappies, 
newspapers, cat faeces, vomit and mouldy food.

Fed on just a banana and some milk a day, he 
scavenged around for scraps.

Officers searching the property also 
found five of his siblings, aged between five and 13, living among the 
knee-deep pizza boxes, used nappies, vodka bottles and cat faeces.

Abusive relationship: Hutton was 16 when she met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford

Seasoned officers described being overcome by emotion as they witnessed one child in the house rummaging among rotting rubbish in a bedroom for items before they took the youngster away.

Other officers talked of rotten food and an almost unbearable smell in the four-bed terraced house.

Neighbours have spoken of their amazement when children they had never seen before emerged from the property on the day the police arrived.

A serious case review into Hamzah's death has been conducted by the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) which will be published later this year.

It will examine all the many contacts Hutton's family had with agencies including the police, social services, schools and health organisations.
