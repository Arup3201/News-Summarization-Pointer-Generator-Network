Authorities are looking for a thief who took a car with two toddlers strapped into their car seats from outside an Orlando hotel parking lot.

According to Orlando police, the mother of the children stopped at the hotel around 8 p.m. to check room availability.  She left the children in the car, but while she went inside  someone stole the car.

The thief drove less than a mile to Gulfstream Road, where the children -aged one and three - were found on the sidewalk. They were still buckled in their car seats but the thief and the vehicle were nowhere to be found.
