A seven-year-old is hoping to win the junior golf world  championships - despite being allergic to the sun.

Ben Brown spends as much time as possible on the golf course, even though he has a rare disorder meaning he can only play for short periods of time in direct sunlight.

He has been diagnosed with solar urticaria, as he breaks out in hives or a rash when he is exposed to ultraviolet light, UV radiation or sometimes even visible light.

After going out in the sun he also develops migraines, feels nauseous, loses his strength and becomes lethargic.

Ben Brown is determined to become a professional golfer and spends as much time on the course as possible - despite suffering a rare condition meaning he is allergic to the sun

Ben breaks out in hives and a rash (pictured left and right) within minutes of being exposed to sunlight, and also develops migraines and feels nauseous and lethargic

Ben has been diagnosed with the rare condition solar uticaria - and takes anti histamines, migraine tablets and prescription suncream. Despite his allergy, he has won prizes in a string of tournaments

Ben's condition is particularly bad at the first sign of sunlight in March and April and in the height of the summer.

Every day he takes an antihistamine tablet and half a migraine tablet – as well as wearing prescription suncream.

But his parents say even while taking his tablets, he struggles to last more than four hours playing golf.

Despite his allergy, Ben took part in his first tournaments last year and now hopes to win the World Championships at Pinehurst, North Carolina, US.

He developed a love of golf when he was just two years old, when his parents Craig and Kathryn bought him a 'Gator Golf' set for his second birthday.

They noticed he had freak accuracy when putting across the living room.

Mrs Brown, 27, of Stockton, Teeside, said: 'Ben started with golf when he got a Gator Golf set for his second birthday and it became like an obsession for him.

'He would spend hours walking backwards and forwards across the living room collecting his ball.

Solar uticaria is a rare condition in which a person breaks out in  hives, weals and nettle rash if they are exposed to sunlight.

Solar urticaria is found worldwide, and while it can start at any age, people aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected.

It is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells. 

Exactly how and why certain types of sunlight cause this is currently uncertain.

The appearance of solar urticaria can be quite dramatic as it usually develops within just a few minutes after exposure to sunlight.

The main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching, stinging and burning. 

Rarely, the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and in such cases it is advisable to seek emergency treatment.

'We actually had to buy three sets so he had one at ours and one at each of his grandparents' to save us taking it with us wherever we went.

'For his third birthday we got Ben a set of golf clubs and began taking him to the driving range.

'It was then that we actually realised that he was a good putter.

'When he was out on the putting green people would stop and watch, surprised at his talent.

'Several times people went to get other people to come outside and see how good he actually was.' 

In terms of his allergy, it is not known why sunlight causes an allergic reaction in some people. 

Ben's family believe it could be because was  born prematurely - which has left him with a weak immune system.

Mrs Brown, who works handling complaints for Barclaycard, said: 'Ben loves golf but it can be hard for him to play.

'He has a sun allergy which causes a full body rash with nausea and sickness.

'We have found a balance of two medications and a prescription suncream.

'While these don't take away the symptoms altogether, they do alleviate them enough to allow him to play golf for short periods.

'Ben was born eight weeks prematurely, weighing just 4lbs and had to spend many weeks in special care before coming home with us.

'As a result of his prematurity, we have found Ben does have a weaker immune system than most.

'It is improving now, but he has had dozens of infections - chest, ear and tonsils - and also was hospitalised with pneumonia.

'We have to be careful with him over the winter when he picks up more illnesses.

'It can mean he is late to start his golfing season or can practice less than he would in the summer.'

She added that Ben knows how to manage his allergy but often tries to continue playing golf even when he is not feeling 100 per cent.

Ben is now set to play in the US Kids Golf Junior World Championships in Pinehurst, North Carolina, in July. He is pictured here with his golf coach Charlie Tetlow, who he says is his inspiration

Ben has his heart set on playing golf professionally, but his parents worry he sometimes carries on playing even when he is not feeling well. His mother Kathryn said:  'For Ben giving up golf is not an option'

Mrs Brown said: 'For Ben, giving up golf is not an option.

'It's all he wants to do and instead we just have to take more care over where and what time he can play.

'It does impact him when he is playing at times. He can struggle to concentrate if he has broken out in hives as they can cause constant itching. But the worst problem for him is the migraines.'

Ben had a tremendous year, with highlights including finishing sixth in his age group in the Wee Wonders UK Championships at the famous Home of Golf, St Andrews, and coming second in the Tiger Club grand final at Gainsborough.

The seven-year-old has now qualified to play the US Kids Golf Junior European Championships in Scotland in May and for the US Kids Golf Junior World Championships in Pinehurst, North Carolina, US, at the end of July.

Mrs Brown added: 'Ben's favourite golfer is Tiger Woods, but his biggest inspiration is his golf coach Charlie Tetlow.

'When Ben was asked what he wanted to be when he grows up he told me he wanted to be Charlie, and that if he couldn't be a professional golfer he wanted to teach children to play.'
