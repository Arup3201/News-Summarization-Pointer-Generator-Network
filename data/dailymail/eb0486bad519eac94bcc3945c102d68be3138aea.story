Carl Froch is ready to grant another British upstart the chance to usurp him as world champion by fighting James DeGale this year.

The super-middleweight left George Groves sprawled on the Wembley canvas in the eighth round of their grudge rematch in May.

And the 37-year-old will hold talks with promoter Eddie Hearn about another domestic dust-up that could be the final fight of his distinguished career.

Friendly rivalry: Carl Froch and James DeGale ringside at the Echo Arena, Liverpool with Sky's Johnny Nelson

Done and dusted: Froch saw off rival George Groves in their re-match with an emphatic knock out

Champion: Froch could fight DeGale or Julio Cesar Chavez in his next fight

Domestic dust up: Froch and DeGale could fight later this year or early next

DeGale, 28, earned his right to fight Froch with an impressive stoppage of Brandon Gonzalez on the undercard at the national stadium.

The Nottingham Cobra is obligated to fight his countryman by February or relinquish his IBF belt.

DeGale, the 2008 Olympic champion, has battled back from a contentious defeat to former gym-mate Groves in 2011.

And Froch told Sky Sports: 'James DeGale is mandatory for the IBF title but I've just had two mandatory defences.

'But everyone knows I don't shy away from any fight.

'We've got to sit down with Eddie Hearn but there's no reason why this fight can't happen.'

Froch's preferred option is a Las Vegas superfight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr but Hearn revealed in his Sportsmail column last week that negotiations have stalled.

'I have had exploratory conversations with Bob Arum who would like the fight to happen in October so we will see how that plays out,' he added.

'I think DeGale would be a huge fight. It is a domestic fight between a legend of the sport and an Olympic champion who is looking to make history and become the first British gold medalist to go on and win a world title.

'I think that a fight with Carl and James could be made either this winter, in November or December, or possibly in the Spring.

'It is all in Carl’s court but what I do know about him is that he will not willingly vacate a title. He worked hard for his titles, he won’t just give them up.'
