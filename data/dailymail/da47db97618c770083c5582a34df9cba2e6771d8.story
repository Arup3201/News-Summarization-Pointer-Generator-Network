Dramatic footage of tragic James Bond stuntman Mark Sutton giving the thumbs up literally seconds before he dies has been released.

The poignant video was taken from inside a helicopter as he prepared to jump out of it in a wingsuit.

Released with the full consent of his family, the heartrending film shows Mark, 42, leaping from the helicopter to his death.

He died 20 seconds later. Mark, who wowed crowds as 007 at the Olympics opening ceremony, crashed into a mountain ridge at a speed of 155 mph.

He was one of 23 world-class wingsuit pilots taking part in a non-competitive event in August in Trient, Switerland, near the French town of Chamonix.

The event - HeliBASE 74 - was organised by EpicTV, an online extreme sports channel that has since made a series of films about it.

Panu Lehti, Head of EpicTV, said: ‘When Mark died we were devastated and planned to shelve the whole project.

'But when the other pilots showed us that the best way to remember Mark was to think about what he would have wanted, we decided to go ahead with the series.

‘We knew it would be difficult for his
 family so before publishing this episode we showed it to his brother 
Steve. It feels good to know we have the family behind us. HeliBASE 74 
is dedicated to the memory of Mark Sutton and to the strength of his 
family and friends as well.’

Tragedy
 struck on the first day of the event. It was Mark’s first jump. He was 
partnered in the helicopter with another British wingsuiter, Tony 
Uragallo.

In the film, Tony movingly describes how the tragedy unfolded.

He says: ‘Everyone is having a good time. It’s so nice to get out above a mountain. Normally we have to climb a mountain.

‘Mark suggested I follow him and I thought ‘that’s great’, because he’s a much better base jumper than me.

‘He’s right there, looking at me, looking at the spot. He’s telling the pilot ‘right, left, bit more, bit more…’

Nervous: In the last piece of footage before his crash Mr Sutton expresses his concerns about the foggy conditions at the beginning of the scheduled day's jump

Mark, dressed in his red, white and blue wingsuit, can be seen edging along the back seat of the chopper towards the open door.

He gestures to the pilot to veer right then puts his right thumb up and climbs out of the helicopter.

Mark launches himself off the side of the helicopter and he is seen free falling, followed closely by Tony.

Footage shows two colourful specks plummeting through the cloud.

Tony
 says: ‘He turns and he jumps and I just followed him. He can follow the
 terrain a lot better than me and I’ll just follow his line.

‘And then he just suddenly turned left real quick. And I couldn’t believe it.’

Tony is then seen landing in a field.

He
 says: ‘I landed close to everyone and I shouted out: ‘Mark hit the 
mountain.’ That destroys everything. Everybody is so upset. People in 
tears.’

Proud: After his James Bond stunt last year, Mark Sutton's girlfriend Victoria Homewood posted this photo on her Facebook with the message: 'My very handsome 007 xxx'

Recalling the moment
 he realized Mark had died, fellow wingsuit pilot Colombian Jhonathan 
Florez says: ‘It’s just so real. Our worst fear was actually happening.’

Norwegian wingsuiter Espen Fadnes says: ‘Tony is landing with this face of confusion and shock.’

Repeatedly drawing his fingers across his throat, he adds: ‘He’s giving me the sign.’

Referring
 to Tony going back up in the helicopter to pinpoint Mark’s location, he
 adds: ‘They can see from the heli that there is no point for them to go
 down and do anything about it.

‘I feel sadness, confusion, shock.’

Tony says: ‘Mark dying like that was just horrifying. Mark was my hero.’

Tony, who has since retired, adds: ‘I am going to go and buy a ranch in Montana and raise horses.’

Austrian
 wingsuiter Hubert Schober, who jumped from the same helicopter as Mark 
minutes before, says: ‘It’s Mark you know.  It’s not like anyone. We’ve 
been in the chopper with him. I’d seen him two minutes before. You shake
 hands. You say: ‘Good flight. Rip it. Tear it up.’ And then two minutes
 later you go like: ‘What?’’

Killed:

parachuted into the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony dressed as 
James Bond has died after a stunt went wrong. Pictured here with Gary 
Connery, right, the skydiving 'Queen' last summer

It
 was Mark’s first jump of the day. Earlier in the film, Mark is seen 
looking up to the sky and saying apprehensively: ‘It’s covered in 
cloud.’

It is not known whether the weather conditions that day were a factor in Mark’s death.

EpicTV,
 an online extreme sports channel, organised the three-day event. They 
have made a four-part film called Risking Everything For The Ultimate 
Flight – HeliBASE 74.

The 
company paid for the participants’ travel, accommodation and helicopter 
flights in return for rights to all footage taken during the event. They
 were each fitted with a number of tiny cameras.

All participants had signed a disclaimer.

Mark shot to fame last year during the opening ceremony for the London Olympics.

He was dressed as James Bond and fellow stuntman Gary Connery doubled as the Queen as they parachuted into the stadium.

The
 stunt came after billions of viewers worldwide watching the opening 
ceremony saw a film of Daniel Craig, dressed in a dinner suit as James 
Bond, call at Buckingham Palace and be joined by the real Queen.

Mark was one of the best-known figures in BASE jumping.

Mark and his fellow wingsuiters had been staying in Chamonix, France, and had crossed over into Switzerland to wingsuit jump.

He had travelled to France with his girlfriend Victoria Homewood, 39.
