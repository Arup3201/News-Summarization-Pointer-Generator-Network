When retired U.S. Army veteran Jason Bos was reunited with his long-lost war pooch, it was hard to tell who was more excited.

After two years apart, Cila the brown Labrador Retriever leaped into his former handler's arms at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport yesterday, as an elated Bos repeatedly yelled, 'Cici! Hi baby!'

'She looked at me, she started smelling me, she knew me,' Bos told Chicago Tribune.

'They tell you not to get too attached, that they’re not a pet, they’re a tool to help keep people safe. But it’s hard.'

Loving relationship: Cila leaped into the arms of Bos, her old partner, at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport yesterday and rolled on her back so Bos could rub her belly

Special bond: Even when he was off-duty, Bos would spend time playing with his war pooch Cila at her kennel, sealing their unique bond

When the duo were paired in 2008, their connection was instant and only got stronger over the course of their five-year partnership.

'No one could work with this dog, and yet, she listened to me,' Bos told Fox 32. 'I don't know why she listened to me. Maybe it's my inflection, maybe it's my personality.'

Bos and Cila M389 searched for roadside bombs and hidden weapons caches during more than 100 missions in Iraq, and screened sites for presidential visits across the U.S.

On base, Bos often spent his off-duty time playing with Cila at the kennel.

But they were separated in 2012 when Bos was forced to retire with a back injury. While the 33-year-old headed home to Michigan, the canine returned to active duty.

'It was tough. I was a little emotional about it because I didn't know if I was going to see her again,' Bos said.

Heartbroken Bos never expected to see his former war time buddy again - until a month ago when he saw on Facebook that Cila was due to be retired.

The kennel master at his former base contacted Bos to see if he wanted to adopt her.

Bos
 reached out to the American Humane Association and Mission K9 Rescue 
for help with the cost of flying Cila from Germany to Chicago.

'A lot of these dogs aren't able to go back to their handler, and I'm one of the lucky ones,' Bos told Fox 32.

Yesterday, after a nine hour flight, Cila stepped out of a travel carrier and into the arms of a very excited and emotional Bos.

Chicago Tribune reported a kennel has been built for Cila, but the pooch will most likely sleep on his new housemate's couch.

'Her whole life has been about working. Now it's time for her to worry about just relaxing,' Bos said. 'It means everything to me.'
