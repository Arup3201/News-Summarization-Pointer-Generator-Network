Secretary of State John Kerry has named former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk as the lead negotiator in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that start tonight.

Mr Indyk's role was announced at the State Department in Washington today, just hours before negotiators restart talks for the first time since 2010.

The new Middle East envoy said he looked forward to working with both sides to achieve 'President Obama's vision of two states, living side by side in peace and security'.

The appointment came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accepted Kerry's invitation to resume direct talks starting on Monday evening.

The agreement to meet in Washington DC tonight for a working dinner follows diligent 
shuttle diplomacy by Mr Kerry in which he has travelled to the region 
six times in the past five months.

Mr Indyk thanked President Obama and
Mr Kerry for entrusting him with 'taking this 
breakthrough and turning it into a full-fledged Israeli-Palestinian peace 
agreement.'

'It is a daunting and humbling challenge, but one that I cannot desist from,' he said. 

Negotiations have been stalled since the 
controversy over Israel approving the settlement-building of 1,300 Jewish settler homes in predominately Arab East Jerusalem in September 2010.

They are considered illegal under international law, although the Israelis dispute this.

The two sides confirmed they would meet hours after Israel approved the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners who had been held for up to thirty years - a long-standing demand of President Abbas.

'I
think reasonable compromises have to 
be a keystone of all of this effort,' Mr Kerry told reporters as he 
acknowledged that the path ahead would be long and difficult.

The initial negotiations starting today, mostly over procedure, are expected to continue on Tuesday. 

The Israeli delegation will be led by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, while chief negotiator Saeb Erekat will represent the Palestinian side.

'I know the negotiations are going to be tough, but I also know that the consequences of not trying could be worse,' Mr Kerry said.

Major sticking points will include the future of Israeli settlements on the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

Mr Kerry explained that he chose Mr 
Indyk because he 'knows what has worked and he knows what hasn't worked,
and he knows how important it is to get this right'.

'He understands that to 
ensure that lives are not needlessly lost, we have to ensure that 
opportunities are not needlessly lost.'

In his new job, Indyk replaces David Hale, who had served as a place holder in the post until last month.

British-born Martin Indyk, 62, currently works as foreign policy director at Washington-based  think tank, the Brookings Institution.

A former kibbutz volunteer and researcher at the pro-Israeli lobbying group AIPAC, he went on to serve as President Clinton's ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997.

Indyk was a significant player in the failed 2000 Camp David talks and he worked with Israeli Prime Ministers Rabin and Barak on Oslo peace process in 1993.

His new role follows a series of frustrations. George Mitchell resigned from the post in   2011 following fruitless attempts to get the Israelis and Palestinians to engage.

Thus far President Abbas has been reluctant to negotiate with hard-line Israeli leader Mr Netanyahu, fearing he will reject what the Palestinians consider minimal territorial demands.

The Palestinians will be heading into the talks seeking a secure state of their own in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in 1967.

However, the Palestinians have need to accept the principle of limited land swaps, allowing Israel to annex some of the dozens of settlements it has built on war-won lands since 1967.

President Abbas had repeatedly said he will only go to talks if Israel either freezes settlement building or recognises the 1967 lines as a starting point for drawing the border of a Palestinian state.

Late last year, the UN General Assembly recognised the State of Palestine within those 1967 borders.

Israel has made no such concessions, at least publicly, and the details of the framework for the talks brokered by Mr Kerry remain undisclosed.
