Proving it's never too late to try something new, former glamour model Linda Lusardi, 55, has embarked upon a new career. 

The Page 3 girl-turned-actress (who's starred in The Bill and Emmerdale) now has now added another string to her bow: she's a budding fashion designer.

Linda has teamed up with online retailer Jami to design a range of soft jersey separates and stretchy dresses.

Linda has designed the collection with the mature market in mind - there's lots of draping to disguise wobbly middles

Prices start at £24.50 for a long plain cami; while a long-sleeved, baggy T-shirt in grey will set you back £48 and a maxi dress with knot detail costs £78.

'All the garments are made inside the UK,' explains Linda. 'The quality of the fabric makes them long-lasting and they won’t go 
out of shape in the wash.'

Linda took inspiration from what she likes to relax in: 'The fabrics and colours that we are using are easy to wear and comfortable – this is exactly the type of style and design that I love.'

However, the collection isn't just for getting comfy in: 'The
versatile range allows you to dress up in high heels and jewellery for 
an evening out or simply put flip-flops on and wear them on holiday,' says Linda.

Linda has tailored her designs to the concerns of the mature market: 'Many
women over 50, as I am, do not want to have their arms showing and 
sometimes their waistline is not as slim as they would like, the fact 
that you can layer these colours and styles makes you feel more 
confident about your figure.

'Having said that, the range is also cross-generational – my teenage daughter has introduced all her friends to it!

Linda looks as good now as she did back in the days when she was a Page 3 regular

Linda has made sure lots of pieces have sleeves - to cover up that middle-age bugbear, the bingo wing
