Golden Retrievers are known to be one of the most-loving dog breeds.

And for one named Smiley, being born without eyes was not going to stop him from being just that.

The gorgeous pup from Stouffville, Canada, was adopted from a 'scary' puppy mill by local dog lover Joanne George, who believes pairing Smiley up with a deaf Great Dane named Tyler was the best decision she has made.

'Tyler was so bouncy and crazy and happy go lucky and [Smiley] turned into the same dog,' George told ABC News.
