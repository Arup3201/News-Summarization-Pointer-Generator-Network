The devastated Bollywood actress sentenced to 26 years in prison for blasphemy in Pakistan has said she has been left reeling by 'the treatment from my own people'. 

Pakistani movie star Veena Malik, 28, said she was left shocked and speechless after hearing the verdict and feared she might have a miscarriage when the controversy first erupted. 

Ms Malik and her businessman husband Asad Bashir Khattak, 30, who have a two-month-old son called Abram, were given lengthy prison terms for taking part in a mock televised wedding celebrating their recent nuptials.

Shocked and angry: Veena and her husband Asad Bashir Khattak were given long prison terms. The stress from the ordeal made Veena fear she would lose baby Abram, now two-months-old

Fears: Veena said: 'I was four months pregnant when this entire controversy happened. I decided to leave the country because of my baby, not because of myself, as I did want to have a miscarriage'

They were accused of acting blasphemously while a religious recital, or munqabat, was performed by musicians as part of the breakfast TV skit. 

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, she said: 'As a person who has served humanity for 14 years,  this is not the treatment I was expecting from my own people. It is very shocking.

'I am still in disbelief that Muslim woman, a daughter, a mother, a sister and a wife can be treated like that. Being Muslim, I know what blasphemy is.' 

'I was four months pregnant when this entire controversy happened. I decided to leave the country because of my baby, not because of myself, as I did want to have a miscarriage.' 

But she said she and her husband planned to fight to clear their names and believed justice would be done. 

And Ms Malik added she was among a number of strong female role models in Pakistan who were winning praise for taking a stance. 

She said: 'I believe women are empowered in Pakistan. You see a lot of women in media and in politics. Malala [Yousafzai] is an example. 

'I have always been a strong personality and get a lot of support from Pakistan. What I see in my country in the future is strong women getting a lot of support and being applauded by my people. 

'I do not think they should be taken as a threat. It is an asset and a beautiful thing. I am sure there are people who appreciate strong women in Pakistan and I see a lot of women emerging in different fields.' 

'Blasphemy': Veena during the staged wedding with Asad on the morning show. Veena said that she was still in disbelief at the judgement and denied that they were laughing and joking during the devotional son

Controversy: Mrs Malik's husband, Asad Bashir Khan, and the chief of the country's biggest media group, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, were also handed 26-year jail terms for their role in the mock wedding in May (above)

Real thing: The couple married in Dubai on Christmas Day last year, then followed their nuptials with a second white wedding on a boat in Washington DC in February

Soured: They planned to have a third celebration near Quetta, Pakistan, where Mr Khattak's family live, after the TV show but were forced to abandon their plans and leave the country

The scandal erupted in May when Islamabad-born Ms Malik, who was then four months pregnant, appeared with her husband in a short sketch for Geo TV. 

On the programme Utho Jago Pakistan [Get Up, Wake Up Pakistan] the pair dressed in wedding garb and sat like newlyweds while wedding songs, or qawwalis, were performed. 

The controversy surrounds a few seconds when the pair are seen laughing and joking together, apparently when a munqabat, or religious verse, about the Prophet Muhammad's daughter is being performed. 

Ms Malik's accusers filed 150 first information reports [FIRs] - court documents complaining about criminal offences - against her at police stations around the country. 

But the actress, who made her name in Bollywood, insisted she did nothing wrong. 'While on the show, I was sitting in a very respectful manner,' she said at her home in Dubai. 

'Some publications were writing that we danced to the qawwali but that is not true. If you see the footage, while they played the munqabat my husband and I were sitting in a very respectful manner and did not say a single word which was disrespectful or blasphemous. 

'No such thing happened. It was a live show and the control of what is shown on any particular song is in the hands of the cameraman. 

'The very next day, the controversy came up and my husband and I were completely shocked because we represented ourselves in a very respectful manner. 

'I thought it was just something that would die down. By the time I left, FIRs were registering in each and every corner of the world.' 

The couple married in Dubai on Christmas Day last year, then followed their nuptials with a second white wedding on a boat in Washington DC in February this year. 

Controversy: Veena is no stranger to controversy. She caused a firestorm three years ago with a series of raunchy poses for the cover of FHM India

Empowered: Veena said women should not be taken as a 'threat', adding: 'It is an asset and a beautiful thing. I am sure there are people who appreciate strong women in Pakistan'

Freedom: Veena told MailOnline that before this ordeal she 'thought it was my basic right to live my life the way I want to live' but now she is 'shocked and saddened'

They planned to have a third celebration near Quetta, Pakistan, where Mr Khattak's family live, after the TV show but were forced to abandon their plans and leave the country. 

They returned to their apartment in Dubai Marina and Ms Malik later flew to the US to have a caesarean birth. 

The couple were convicted on Tuesday by an anti-terrorism court in Gilgit. Judges said in a court order they had 'ignited the sentiments of all the Muslims of the country and hurt the feelings, which cannot be taken lightly.' 

The pair had hoped to return to Pakistan, where their parents still live, but fear being jailed if they do not clear their names first. Their lawyers are mounting an appeal in Gilgit and have managed to quash FIRs in a number of states. 

Ms Malik said: 'I thought it was my basic right to live my life the way I want to live but after this whole thing has come up, I am shocked and saddened.'

Ms Malik thinks she is being used as a pawn in a media war being waged in Pakistan. Geo TV has frequently come in the firing line and a month after her appearance, Geo News was ordered off air and fined £60,000 for criticising the head of Pakistan's spy service, the ISI. 

Ms Malik said: 'I will fight. There are higher courts and I strongly believe everything will be rolled back because there is no substance in this. I still feel Pakistan is my country.' 

Fight: Veena said that she believes Pakistan courts will roll back the sentence because there is 'no substance'to the case. She added she believed the whole episode has been politically motivated 

Disbelief: Veena concluded that 'as a Muslim woman, a daughter, a mother, a sister and a wife can be treated like that. Being Muslim, I know what blasphemy is'

She added she had no regrets about the decisions she had made in her career, including causing a storm by appearing on a raunchy cover of FHM India three years ago. 

'At the particular given time, I made the best decisions in my life and I don't regret a thing,' she said. 'Whatever I have done, I have done with dignity. I know I have been brutally criticised but I have faced everything gracefully.'
