Sebastian Vettel has described his move to Ferrari as an 'incredible honour' after signing a three-year deal to replace Fernando Alonso. 

Alonso is heading for McLaren, the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, with Vettel ending his stay at Red Bull. 

Vettel, the four-time world champion, will team up with Kimi Raikkonen at the Prancing Horse. He will earn about £50million a year as the highest-paid driver in history.

'The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true,' Vettel said.

'When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it’s an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.

'I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. 

'The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.'

The two announcements have been the worst-kept secrets in Formula One.

Whilst there has been no confirmation from Alonso as to his future plans, it is understood he has already agreed a deal to return to McLaren which will be announced in December.

The team are still mulling over whether Jenson Button or Kevin Magnussen will partner Alonso from 2015.

For Alonso, it is the end of his five-year relationship with the team which ultimately has failed to yield the third world title he long believed would be his in switching allegiance to the Maranello marque.

The Spaniard did finish runner-up on three occasions, missing out by four points in 2010 and just three in 2012, whilst he was a long way adrift last season, with Vettel champion on each occasion.

Instead, Alonso leaves with only 11 victories to his name, the last of which was on home soil in Spain last season, as well as another 33 podiums.

Since Red Bull's announcement of Vettel's departure seven weeks ago, Alonso has since played games with the media when quizzed on his future plans.

Although apparently knowing where he is heading, the 33-year-old still conceded leaving Ferrari was tough.

Alonso is expected to replace 2009 world champion Jenson Button at McLaren next season 

Alonso said: 'Today is not an easy one for me, because even if I always look to the future with great enthusiasm and determination, at the end of this season my journey as a Ferrari driver will come to an end.

'It was a difficult decision to take, but a carefully considered one, and from start to finish, my love for Ferrari was a prime consideration.

'I have always been lucky enough to make my own decisions about my future and I have that possibility now too.

'I must thank the team for that, as it understood my position.

'I leave Scuderia Ferrari after five years, during which I reached my very best level professionally, tackling major challenges that pushed me to find new limits. I also proved to be a true team player, putting the interests of the Scuderia before my own.

'When I had to take important decisions about my future, I did so with Ferrari in my heart, driven by my love for the team.

'I am very proud of what we have achieved together. Thanks to the efforts of the men and women of Maranello, on three occasions we came second in the Formula One world championship, two of them fighting for the title right up to and including the final race, running in a championship winning position for many laps.

'Without a shadow of a doubt, these five years produced some of the best moments of my career.

'I also feel that, in leaving the team, it is family rather than friends I am leaving behind.

'Now I look to the future with great enthusiasm, knowing that part of my heart will always belong to the Prancing Horse.

'I want to thank each and everyone of the team for the trust they showed in me.'
