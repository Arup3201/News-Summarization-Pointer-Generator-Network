Supermarket Aldi is urging customers who bought one of its chocolate products to return them to the shop after salmonella was found in one batch.

The budget chain is recalling all 200g packs of 'Choceur Treasures' which have been sold in the Midlands.

The suspect treats are described as 'whole hazelnuts wrapped in waffle and milk chocolate' and have a best before date of 1 September 2015.

Aldi is recalling 200g packs of 'Choceur Treasures' sold in 100 of its stores across the Midlands

A statement from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said: 'Aldi has recalled the product and product recall notices are on display in the relevant stores.

'These notices explain to customers why the product has been recalled and advise them of how to get a refund if they bought it.

'If you have bought the above product, do not eat it. Instead, return the product to the nearest store.'

The products are believed to have been sold in nearly 100 stores including those in Birmingham, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Coventry.

An Aldi spokesperson stated: 'Aldi has recalled 200g packs of "Choceur Treasures" with a best before date of 1st September 2015 because salmonella was detected in one batch of the product on sale in Aldi stores in the Midlands region only.

'If any of our shoppers have bought this product, we ask them to check the best before date and do not eat it if the packaging states that the best before date is 1st September 2015.

'Instead, return the product to the nearest store and you will receive a full refund or exchange.

'Please be assured that that the safety of our shoppers is our number one priority and this was an isolated incident.'

The suspect products are part of the store's Choceur range. The company insists safety is a priority

Typical symptoms of salmonella infection are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

These symptoms generally develop within one to three days of exposure to the bacterium and may last for up to a week.

While anyone can become ill from exposure to salmonella, the risk of infection is particularly high for children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.

While salmonella contamination is usually associated with eggs and poultry, outbreaks have been linked to other foods in the past.
