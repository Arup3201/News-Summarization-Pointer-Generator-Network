It's the moment every pet owner dreads - when the time comes when they have to say a final goodbye to a faithful friend.

These heart-breaking end-of-life snaps are meant to highlight the special relationship between an owner and their dying pet in its last moments.

Sarah Ernhart, the owner of Sarah Beth Photography in Minneapolis,  created them in what she dubbed a 'Joy Session', in which she records owners' last embrace with their pets that are too old to live or have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses.

Final embrace: These special, end-of-life photography sessions are just for terminally ill or elderly pets

Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, trademarked the name Joy Session, and began offering them in 2010. She has since had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets.

'People seem to love the idea,' she said. 'It's getting bigger and bigger.'

The service has become so popular that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners.

'It can definitely be very emotional,' Mrs Ernhart said. 'It's a very sensitive time for these people who have been with these animals for their entire lives. I definitely have cried with some of the owners.

'The sessions can be happy at the same time because the owners get to talk about their favorite little quirks and things that they like about their pets. I get this inside view of what these people's lives are like. It's a pretty powerful.'

Explaining how she came up with the idea, Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name "Joy Session" is not something I arbitrarily chose. There's a 
very personal meaning behind it, and I'd like to share how it all began.

Last moments: The beautiful, yet heartbreaking pictures, are meant to highlight the relationship between pet and owner before they pass

'Shortly
 before Christmas in 2009, I had a photo shoot with a woman named Joan. 
Her friend booked the session as a gift, and we had a beautiful sunny 
day for it.

'Joan was living
 at home in Hospice care, and relied on the companionship and day-to-day
 help of her Service Dog, a Black Lab named Joy. Joy was her rock, her 
best friend, and had saved Joan's life on more than one occasion.

'She would let Joan know when her blood sugar was low, and if she was about to have a seizure. 
Joy would place herself under Joan to break her fall, stand firm to help
 her up, and was by her side day and night. I came into this session 
knowing that Joan didn't have much time left, but I had no idea I'd be meeting such a vibrant, funny, happy woman.

'She
 was so blessed to have Joy come into her life, and her eyes lit up with
 every story she told of her. She said that Joy was her "gift from God" 
and taking these photos had given her something wonderful to look 
forward to.

'Their bond was 
palpable, and it was easy to see that both of them were very loved. Her 
apartment was filled with the word "Joy" in artwork and pillows and 
Christmas decorations.

'She even wore a "Joy"
 sweatshirt during our session.We sat and chatted for a long time. 
Joan's zest for life, even with her declining health, was a breath of 
fresh air for me, and helped me see that what I do is meaningful and 
important in so many ways.

Emotional: The photographer said the sessions are for people who want to 'celebrate the happiness' their pets have brought to their lives

'Without
 knowing it at the time, she and Joy sparked the idea to offer photo 
sessions specifically for pets that are nearing the end of their lives.

'For so many people, their pets mean the world to them, and I want to 
provide an opportunity to capture what makes them so special, especially
 in such a difficult time.

'My
 first "official" Joy session was with a Bernese Mountain dog named 
Griffin, in January of 2010. I really didn't know what to call this 
service, and "Emergency Session" was the first thing I could think of. 
It sounded so cold and impersonal, and I struggled with what I should 
really call it.

Difficult time: For many people, their pets mean the world to them, said Mrs Ernhart

The snapper says she had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets since she launched the service three years ago

Mrs Ernhart said: 'The sessions can be happy at the same time because the owners get to talk about their favorite little quirks and things that they like about their pets'

'A few days after posting Griffin's
 blog, and receiving some very nice suggestions from readers, I realised
 the perfect name was sitting right in front of me.Â I couldn't think of 
anything or anyone I'd met who embodied such love and such a deep 
connection as Joan and Joy.

'These sessions really are for people who want to celebrate the happiness - the joy - their pets have brought to their lives.'
