It's the snack with a proud history stretching back over more than 75 years. But the Kit Kat is about to have its recipe changed – as part of the new phase of a public health drive.

The Department of Health will today announce the details of a campaign called the ‘Responsibility Deal’ - a partnership with the food industry aimed at reducing the nation’s consumption of saturated fat.

As part of the scheme, Nestle has signed up to change the oil used to make the wafer filling in its best-selling Kit Kat. The move will cut out 3,800 tonnes of saturated fat from more than a billion bars every year.

Changes: The Kit Kat is getting a revamp, with a more healthy recipe

But despite the alteration, which will see saturated fat levels in a standard four-finger chocolate bar come down from 7.2g to 6.4g, manufacturers Nestle are insisting that the new recipe is not going to compromise the product’s taste.

Managing director Ciaran Sullivan said: ‘Improving the nutritional profile of Kit Kat does not come at the expense of quality and taste - consumers will continue to enjoy the same Kit Kat as they have for over 75 years.’

He added: ‘This is the next step on the journey where we are improving the nutritional profile of our products.

‘Kit Kat is our biggest confectionery brand and therefore the obvious choice to identify a saturated fat reduction.’

The deal will also see Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons reduce fat in their products including some of their own-brand spreads, cheese and breadsticks.

Mondelez International, which is part of Kraft and owns the Cadbury brand, will reformulate products such as Belvita breakfast biscuits and Oreo chocolate cookies.

Subway will cut the amount of saturated fat in their ‘Kids Pak’ children’s meal by more than 70 per cent, and catering giant Compass – which serves more than a million meals a day across their 7,000 sites - will promote healthier menus as part of the pledge.

As well as this, Unilever and Aldi have promised to reformulate products and look at reducing portion sizes.

And the nation’s 10,500 fish and chip shops are being encouraged to switch to healthier oils, such as Omega 9, which contain less of the fat.

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘One in six male deaths and one in nine female deaths are from coronary heart disease - this is why it is critical that we challenge the way we eat and that we all make changes where we can.’

She added: ‘It’s hugely encouraging that companies providing almost half the food available on the UK market have committed to this Responsibility Deal and are leading the way to give their customers healthier products and lower fat alternatives.’
