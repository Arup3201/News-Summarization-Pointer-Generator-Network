Lord Leveson wants Ofcom to 'verify' a new independent regulator and act as a 'backstop' for those newspapers which did not sign up

One of New Labour’s most powerful quangos would have ultimate responsibility for press regulation under dramatic plans set out in Lord Leveson’s report.

The judge insisted his proposals would not amount to state regulation of newspapers, but legislation was needed to enforce it.

But both David Cameron and Nick Clegg today criticised the plan to change the law to put state media watchdog Ofcom in overall charge of ‘verifying’ a new independent regulatory body.

The report recommended the new body would be able to impose £1million fines on newspapers and demand front page apologies.

The Prime Minister said he agreed with much of what Lord Leveson suggested, but refused to back legislation to enforce it.

Lord Leveson said his proposed new body  - to replace the existing Press Complaints Commission - would promote high standards of journalism and protect the rights of individuals.

As part of the judge's plans, the chairman and the board of the new body must include a majority of members who are independent from the industry.

Serving editors, MPs and ministers would be banned from being on the board.

A separate independent panel - which could include a serving editor - would make appointments to the board and its chairman.

The panel in turn would be overseen by Ofcom, which would review the independence of the process every two years.

But Ofcom is a government quango, and its chief executive is appointed by ministers, raising serious doubts about the process's independence from government.

While David Cameron and Nick Clegg disagree on much of the Leveson report, both are opposed to the idea of Ofcom overseeing the system of regulation

Legislation passed in Parliament would be 
needed for the new body to be recognised in legal processes and to allow
Ofcom to oversee its independence and effectiveness.

These are the main proposals for the press set out in the Leveson report:

Ofcom would also be a ‘backstop’ regulator for newspapers who did not sign up to the new scheme.

Under Lord Leveson's plans, an 
arbitration process would be put in place for newspapers to resolve 
complaints from members of the public.

Organisations
that signed up would have legal costs limited if the dispute went to 
court, but this would require a change in the law.

Lord Leveson also wants legislation to ‘enshrine, for the first time, a legal duty on the Government to protect the freedom of the press’

But the idea of state body Ofcom being involved in press regulation has proven one of the most contentious parts of the plan.

Mr Cameron warned: 'Ofcom is already a very powerful regulatory body and we should be trying to reduce concentrations of power rather than increase them.'

Ofcom was set up by Tony Blair in 
2003. Six years later, David Cameron warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will 
cease to exist' if he became PM as part of a crackdown on quangos.

The chief executive of Ofcom is currently Ed Richards, appointed in 2006, who was previously a media advisor to Mr Blair.

Mr
Richards, was tipped as Director General of the BBC, can continue in 
the post for as long as he likes because the job does not have a fixed 
term.

Lord Justice Leveson insisted ‘this is not, and cannot be characterised as, statutory regulation of the press’.

‘What
is proposed here is independent regulation of the press organised by 
the press, with a statutory verification process to ensure that the 
required levels of independence and effectiveness are met by the system 
in order for publishers to take advantage of the benefits arising as a 
result of membership,’ he added.

Government quango Ofcom was created by Tony Blair, and its current chief executive Ed Richards is a former New Labour policy advisor. Critics say because the Ofcom boss is appointed by ministers it cannot oversee press regulation

While Mr Clegg has backed much of the Leveson plan, he also warned against involving Ofcom.

‘Ofcom has a key role in regulating the content of broadcast media and I'm yet to be convinced that it is best placed to take on this new, light touch function with the print media too,’ the Deputy Prime Minister said.

Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Media Select Committee, warned Ofcom would wield too much power. He said: ‘We just can’t simply farm out these important decisions with a blank cheque to somebody who is wholly unelected and unaccountable.

‘Having the Government say to the press, “These are the specific steps we need you to take, otherwise we will either legislate or regulate” is a pretty rum form of self-regulation.’
