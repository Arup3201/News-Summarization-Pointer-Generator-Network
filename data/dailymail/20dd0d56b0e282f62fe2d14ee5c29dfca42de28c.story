Beaten: Zhongxing claims he was horrifically beaten by security guards in 2005 and left paralysed as a result

In a blog post, Zhongxing wrote: 'We looked to the sky, and the sky looked away; we called to the earth, and the earth did not respond.

'We have been forsaken but have nobody to turn to, so all I could do was to hold back tears and go back to Shandong.

'And now I am festering away, paralysed and over 100,000 yuan in debt.'

According to media website Shanhaiist, Zhongxing was originally from Shandong province, but moved to Guangdong in search of work.

He bought himself a motorbike and started a taxi business.

One night in June, 2005 he claims he was taking a chef home called Gong Tao when a police car sounded its' siren.

He wrote: 'At the time I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, and the road was quite narrow so I did not stop and continued driving.

'When I passed by the Xin Tang Public Security Office, I saw there were seven or eight chengguan (local law enforcement officers) blocking the road, holding steel rods and pipes.

'Just as I was about to brake, a chengguan threw one of the steel pipes across my face, throwing both myself and my passenger on the floor.

'When I came to, it was already noon the next day. I was in pain all over, and when I opened my eyes I saw that I was lying on the hospital bed, the passenger I took was also hurt and in hospital.

'When Gong Tao saw that I was conscious, he told me that policemen from Xin Tang Public Security refused to let me go and started hitting my legs, feet, waist, striking me furiously with the steel bars.

'They hit me until I was unconscious, and only took me to hospital when they'd seen the police car that was following me had also arrived onto the scene, and that I was practically dead. After that, they disappeared without a trace.

'Because we are farmers, and are poor, no matter who we turn to, nobody wants to help us. And what's more, when the chengguan found us, they turned around and called us tramps and beat us.

'If it weren't for them taking us to hospital on time, I wouldn't have survived.'

Zhongxing claims to have been left heavily in debt as a result his legal battle for compensation, and is trying to claim 334,782 yuan from the Chinese authorities, about Â£36,000.

The post has not been corroborated and his original blog was taken down shortly after Saturday's chilling incident.

Zhongxing was originally suspected to have died in the blast at around 6.24pm local time, but Chinese state media said later he survived and was taken to hospital.

Shortly before the explosion, Zhongxing was seen handing out leaflets to passengers.

A photograph emerged online in the wake of the explosion showing a man in a wheelchair brandishing something in the air, along with another showing an empty wheelchair on its side in the smoke-filled arrivals hall.
