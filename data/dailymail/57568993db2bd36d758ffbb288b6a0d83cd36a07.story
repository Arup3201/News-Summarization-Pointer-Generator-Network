Kate Moss has been named the most classically glamorous celebrity on the planet by a panel made up of some of the fashion and beauty world's top names.

Despite competition from Kate Hudson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Yasmin Le Bon, the judging panel at the Rodial Beautiful Awards, which included Jasmine Guinness, Jo Wood and designer Ben de Lisi among others, plumped for glamorous Kate.

Other winners on the night included Rita Ora, who beat off Lana del Rey and Alice Dellal to take the prize for 'Most Edgy Look', and Lisa Eldridge who was named 'Best Make-up Artist'.

Tuesday night's event, which took place at the St Martin's Lane Hotel in London was the fourth Rodial Beautiful Awards.

Previous winners include Elle Macpherson, who took home last year's 'Classic Glamour' award and Sadie Frost who won the same gong in 2011.

Although Moss wasn't on hand to receive her prize, best friend Frost was. Sporting a chic black 'Penelope' dress by the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite eco label, Beulah, she picked up the award on the model's behalf, along with hairdresser, James Brown, declaring that she would be 'thrilled' to discover that she'd won.

Also at the St Martin's Lane Hotel was swimwear designer Melissa Odabash who was happy to reveal the secret of her gorgeously brown legs to MailOnline.

The bronzed fashionista said that her golden glow comes courtesy of organic Irish tanning brand, Vita Liberata, and laughingly admitted to slapping on a last minute dose of the product just before leaving the house.

Odabash also found time to impart a little of her beauty wisdom, saying that the secret of good skin is a combination of plentiful water and an alkaline diet.

'An alkaline diet gives you so much more energy,' she explained. 'Also try running three times a week for 20 minutes at a time and be as natural as you can be.'

Also ready to reveal her beauty secrets was Rodial founder, Maria Hatzistefanis, who arrived buzzing with excitement about her soon-to-launch men's skincare brand, Nip+Man.

According to Hatzistefanis, the key to good skin is proper exfoliation, which, she said, most people don't do often enough.

'Make sure you have a good cleanser and moisturiser too,' she added. 'And don't ever forget to take your make-up off before you go to bed.'

Other guests on hand to watch the ever so slightly tipsy Julien Macdonald present the awards, included Spandau Ballet star, Gary Kemp and his stylist wife, Lauren, entrepreneur Jo Wood and man-about-town, Henry Conway.

Despite being on crutches, designer Amanda Wakeley also made an appearance at the event, as did actress Camilla Rutherford, Made in Chelsea star, Mille Mackintosh and Migi Drummond of 80s band, Curiosity Killed the Cat.

Although not a winner himself, celebrity hairstylist James Brown was on hand to pick up the Classic Beauty prize for his best friend, Kate Moss. Cornered by MailOnline, he agreed to reveal his top five hair tips exclusively to us. Wave goodbye to bad hair days!

1. 'Keep your hair simple; its easier for you and looks better.'

2. 'Practice makes perfect: it's the only way you'll get it right every time.'

3. 'After shampoo and conditioner, never use more than two products.'

4. 'Looks that require hair up work better with hair that hasn't been washed for a day.'

5. 'Use dry shampoo to freshen up your look and give texture to your hair. My James Brown London Dry Shampoo (£7.19, boots.com) is great for this.'
