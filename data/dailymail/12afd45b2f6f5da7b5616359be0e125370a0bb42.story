A couple who kept dozens of animals in such squalid conditions that two of them had to be put down have been jailed for a total of six months.

June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, kept their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in such filthy surroundings that RSPCA officers were overwhelmed by the stench of ammonia and had to call off the visit.

Their water supplies were so dirty they had turned black and many of the animals suffered infected eyes, rotting teeth and ulcers as they lay in their own feces.

June Harding, 46, and husband Paul, 45, of Montacute, Somerset, left their 31 dogs, seven cats and four guinea pigs to sleep in such filthy surroundings that RSPCA officers were overwhelmed by the stench of ammonia and had to call off the visit

Police who visited their home had to abandon the search because of the overbearing stench of ammonia and RSPCA inspectors described the conditions as 'appalling'.

They managed to save 40 of the animals but every single animal rescued had respiratory problems due to the lack of ventilation and vets recommended two were put down. 

The pair were each sentenced to 12 weeks in prison at Taunton Magistrates Court in Somerset after pleading guilty to a total of 28 charges of animal neglect.

Sentencing, Chair of the Bench Clive Powell said it was the worst case he had seen in 30 years.

'My stomach churned when I saw the pictures provided by the RSPCA,' he said.

'It is the court judgment that the totality of the offending and culpability mean that nothing sort an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate.

'Between us we have 60 years experience, 30 years myself.

'I don't recall in that near?y 30 years any office as serious as this involving so many animals in such a poor state.'

The court heard how police officers first visited the couple's home in Montacute, Somerset, on May 6 last year.

Matthew Knight, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'Mr Handing was reluctant to let police into the property.

'The officers noted the poor quality of the house and abandoned their search on health and safety grounds.'

Police returned with the RSPCA on June 30 and found similar conditions.

'In general the interior was filthy,' said Mr Knight. 'There was an overpowering smell of ammonia that is a product of wee.

'A number of officers had to leave the property due to the smell. The hallway of this property was was covered in dirt, hair and faeces.

'The living room - little natural light with puddles of urine on the floor.

'There was a very small window ajar. This seemed to be the only form of ventilation.

'There was a room at the back called the cat room.

'Six cats were found. They seemed frightened and lived inside old chairs.

'The windowsill was covered in faeces.'

However, during interview Mrs Harding said she believed the animals were 'fit and well'.

Clive Rees, mitigating, said that Mrs Harding genuinely thought she was looking after the animals while Mr Harding had tried to distance himself from the situation.

He said: 'The pair did not inflict anything on the animals that they did not inflict on themselves.

'Clearly they were having to live in the premises and were blind to the fact it was in such a mess.

'Their intention was to look after the animals but the care of the animals was not adequate.'

Mr Harding was found guilty of all 16 offences on February 11 - 13 of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and three of failing to meet needs of the animals.

Mrs Harding pleaded guilty to 12 charges on December 16 - nine of causing unnecessary suffering and three of failing to meet the needs of the animals.

The couple were also banned from keeping animals for life and also banned from contesting the order for 10 years.

Many of the animals have since been rehomed thanks to the RSPCA. An appeal against the sentence has already been lodged but bail was denied while it is processed.
