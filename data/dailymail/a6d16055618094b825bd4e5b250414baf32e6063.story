A toddler has died in a farming tragedy after being hit by a pick-up truck on his mother's birthday.

The boy, who was nearly two-years-old, died after being hit by a silver Nissan 4x4 at the farm near Fersfield in countryside between Diss and Kenninghall in Norfolk at around 4pm yesterday.

Paramedics battled to save the childâ€™s life but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Tragedy: The boy was hit by a Nissan 4X4 at around 4pm yesterday on private land between Diss and Kenninghall

The man driving the truck was in his 60s and is believed to be a close friend of the family who had worked on the estate for years.

Detective Inspector Andy Coller said the death appeared to be 'a tragic accident'.

He said: 'Our investigations are continuing with officers working closely with the Health and Safety Executive, however, at this time all indications are that this appears to have been a tragic accident.

'We have a specialist officer lending support to the family at this very difficult time and this will continue.'

The farm worker was due to retire after Christmas, it is understood.

A close family friend of the toddler's grandmother said the village has been completely 'rocked' by the tragedy.

The friend, who asked not to be named, said: 'We found out yesterday and the village is completely in shock. It is a terrible farming accident that the family will have to live with forever.

'It was one of the old chaps who has worked on their family farm for years - he was due to retire at Christmas. I can't imagine what he's going through. It's just a tragic, tragic accident.

Heartbreak: The boy, aged nearly two, is understood to have died on the day of his mother's birthday

'I found out last night before choir practice and just couldn't believe it. The village is totally rocked and devastated by the news.

'We were all practising Christmas carols and made the decision not to practise 'Away in a Manger'.

'It would have been too heartbreaking. The family had so much to look forward too, especially with Christmas coming up, I don't know how they'll cope.

'It was the boy's mum's birthday yesterday too, just devastating it's all happened at once.'

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed and inquiries are ongoing involving CID and roads policing officers to determine what exactly happened.

A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the Kenninghall area at around 4pm yesterday following reports a young male had been involved in a collision with a vehicle.

'The incident, which took place at a farm off Fersfield Road, involved a silver Nissan pick-up truck. Paramedics attended and the toddler was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

'The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and enquiries are ongoing by CID and roads policing officers to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.

'Police have been speaking to the male driver of the truck, aged in his 60s. No arrests have been made.'

It is understood the coroner has been informed of the death.
