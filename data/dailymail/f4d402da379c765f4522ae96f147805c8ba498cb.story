Smiling for the camera, this photograph depicts one of the happiest moments of Rachel Inglefield's life

The moment she arrived home with her new baby for the first time.

But the elated new mother had no idea of the tragedy that would befall her just days later.

Crippled by a devastating stroke, Mrs Inglefield was left paralysed, unable to cuddle her newborn son or help care for her young daughter. 

At the age of just 38 she woke up away from her children on a specialist stroke ward, where she was the youngest patient being treated.  

But it was the thought of looking after her new baby Jamie, and his big sister Serena, who was 16-months-old at the time, that gave her the motivation to get better.

In this photograph, Rachel Inglefield had just brought her new baby son Jamie home from hospital, where he was enjoying time with sister Serena. An hour later, Mrs Inglefield suffered a stroke that left her paralysed 

Mrs Inglefield spent ten days on a specialist stroke ward, and said the motivation to care for her children inspired her to recover. She is pictured with son Jamie, now three years old

Rachel and her daughter Serena learned to walk together - including reaching their milestone walk to the post box outside their home

She began the long road to recovery, eventually re-learning to walk at the same time as her daughter took her first few steps.

Mrs Inglefield, now 41, said: 'It was comical in a way; we both took our first wobbly steps across the living room.

'We held onto each other, walking to the post box, at the end of the road. It was a huge milestone for us both.'

To celebrate her recovery, Mrs Inglefield together with Serena and her husband, Ed, completed a half mile walk to raise money for stroke charities.

Her stroke has proved the catalyst for reassessing their lifestyle, and they have now given up their high-flying jobs in London and relocated to the sleepy village of Ogbourne St George in Wiltshire.

Mrs Inglefield, a PR executive, said: 'I expected my son's birth to be one of the most joyful occasions of my life. The last thing I expected was a life-threatening stroke.

During pregnancy, the levels of female hormones rise, causing changes in the blood vessels and the make-up of the blood.

During pregnancy the blood pressure can also rise.

These changes can increase the risk of stroke.

Pregnant women are 13 times more likely to have a stroke than non-pregnant women of the same age. 

However the risk of stroke in young women is small and strokes caused by pregnancy and childbirth are rare. 

It has been estimated that a stroke during pregnancy affects eight out of every 100,000 women. 

Research has shown that the risk of stroke is increased in the last three months of pregnancy and in the six weeks following birth. 

If you are pregnant and have existing high blood pressure or symptoms of blood vessel disease you should be closely monitored during your pregnancy.

Strokes that happen during pregnancy should be treated in the same way as any other stroke.

The risk of another stroke occurring in future pregnancies is unknown. 

It is thought to be a very low risk and it is likely to depend on the exact cause of your first stroke.

'My doctors tell me pregnancy-related strokes are extremely rare. They think I tore the arteries in my neck, pushing during contractions.

'It is so important to me that Jamie does not in any way feel responsible for what happened.

'He and Serena were my motivation for getting better again. I wanted to cuddle them and look after them, and be their mummy again.'

Mrs Inglefield was fit and healthy and had enjoyed a normal pregnancy with her second child, right up to his birth in March 2012.

After the labour, Mrs Inglefield developed a severe headache which doctors suggested was due either to constipation or an epidural leak.

But 11 days after the birth, she collapsed and lost all feeling down one side.

She said: 'I was rushed to hospital for a brain scan but the doctors said they couldn't inject the necessary dye, because I was breast feeding.'

Her condition improved and she was sent home.

The following night, as she caught up with her supermarket shopping online, she collapsed once more.

She said: 'Like all new mums, I had fallen behind with the shopping so I was doing it online when I felt a loud click in my head. The pain was so bad I was violently sick.'

Her speech was slurred, she had lost feeling down her left side, and her face and mouth were drooping. She had extreme dizziness which left her unable even to sit up straight.

She had suffered a massive stroke.

'I found myself on a stroke unit - at 38, the youngest one there - and I was totally bewildered,' she said.

'I couldn't even let myself think about Jamie. It was too painful. All I wanted was to be with him. I felt guilty; I was letting him down.

'Of course the stroke unit was not suitable for new mothers. I was hormonal, still bleeding, and trying to express milk. All the other patients were elderly and it was horrendous. 

Mrs Inglefield's stroke caused her and her husband to reassess their lifestyles. They gave up high-flying jobs in London and moved to the sleepy village of Ogbourne St George in Wiltshire to raise their children

Two months on from her stroke, Rachel was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time

During her pregnancy, Mrs Inglefield suffered headaches, but doctors chalked them up to constipation or an epidural leak

'There was one advantage - I used my breast pads to cover my eyes when I wanted to sleep!'

Ten days later, she was discharged from hospital, but was still unable to walk or use her left side.

She was unable to look after herself and could not hold or feed her new baby. 

Mrs Inglefield said: 'I really worried that we wouldn't bond. My husband was wonderful, looking after the children. But it wasn't the same. I wanted to be there for my son.'

She had physiotherapy and rehab classes and began a determined recovery.

She said: 'The thought of holding Jamie kept me going. I wanted to be able to hold him myself.'

Her daughter, Serena, was sixteen months old and ready to take her first steps - and so mother and daughter began learning to walk together.

Mrs Inglefield said: 'She was very wobbly, just like me. We walked across the living room holding onto furniture. 

'Our goal was to walk together to the post box outside our home, and when we did it, it was fantastic.'

Two months on from her stroke, Mrs Inglefield was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time.

And she and Serena also completed a half-mile fundraising walk.

So far the mother and daughter duo have raised more than £30,000 for stroke charities.

Mrs Inglefield said her husband, Ed, was 'wonderful', but it pains her that her stroke meant she wasn't able to look after her son when he was a tiny baby. But she is now able to look after her children alone. 'I can't return to work yet, I can't play sport and I get tired easily. But I know I am lucky to be alive,' she said

She said: 'I am still on the road to recovery. I am now able to look after the children on my own, though we have an au-pair to help out and keep an eye on us all.

'I can't return to work yet, I can't play sport and I get tired very easily. But I know I am lucky to be alive.

'Serena is only four years old but she understands when I'm having a bad day, and she'll say: "mummy head hurt."

'I feel sad that I don't remember Jamie as a tiny baby at all really. I hope that he won't associate his birth with my stroke. I would hate for him to feel bad or guilty in any way.

'Despite my fears, he and I share a very special bond.

'After all, he was my inspiration for fighting this and getting myself better. I owe my recovery to my two lovely children.'
