GPs are being paid nearly £1,500 a shift to work nights and weekends in crisis-hit A&E units.

Four in ten casualty departments are 
hiring family doctors – already paid an average £104,000 a year – to 
help deal with the soaring numbers of patients.

The figures emerged on the day doctors came under fire for suggesting that patients should be charged up to £10 a visit to a casualty unit to deter those who do not need to be there.

Moonlighting: Of the 86 trusts which replied to FoI requests, 36 said they employed GPs in a range of roles including assessing patients when they arrived, treating the less seriously-ill and providing general cover

Critics said it was extraordinary that doctors, who for the past decade have been allowed to choose not to work out-of-hours, were moonlighting at stretched A&E units for extra cash.

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Mail asked all 130 NHS hospital trusts in England with A&E units whether they employed GPs in their casualty departments and, if so, how much they were paid.

Of the 86 trusts which replied, 36 said they employed GPs in a range of roles including assessing patients when they arrived, treating the less seriously-ill and providing general cover.

Hourly rates vary from £50 at Wirral hospital in Merseyside to £98 at Wrightington, Wigan, and £100 at Portsmouth Hospitals.

At least one recruitment firm is offering family doctors £120 an hour for a 12-hour shift – a total of £1,440 – at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London.

Primary Care People, which recruits for hospitals across London, also said it would pay £115 an hour for a 12-hour overnight shift at the Royal London hospital in East London, or £90 an hour for a day shift.

A source at the firm said the rates were so good that doctors were travelling to the capital from all over the country, including one who drives 120 miles down from Birmingham to do two shifts a week.

The firm covers all travel expenses and pays for GPs to stay in a three or four-star hotel if needed, on a budget of £60 a night, which is billed back to the NHS.

A&E units across England are facing what is feared to be one of the worst-ever winters and many are struggling to cope with a huge influx in patients on top of desperate shortages of consultants.

Over the past decade the numbers of patients arriving in casualty has soared by 50 per cent and this has partly been blamed on failings of GP out-of-hours’ care.

GPs have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends since a botched contract negotiated in 2004 and services are largely provided by out-of-hours firms, which many patients don’t trust.

Last night Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘GPs can’t be prepared to turn out for their own patients but they are happy to work elsewhere for a lot more money.

‘So much for the interests of the patients, it’s the interests of the doctors which are paramount. The reason patients are going to A&E is because they can’t get into their own surgery. It’s ludicrous.’

Britain has fewer doctors per person than nearly all other European countries, according to a report.

There are an average of 2.71 medics for every 1,000 people, compared to six in Greece, five in Austria and nearly four in Italy.

A European Commission report ranks the UK 24th out of 27 countries in the EU, ahead of only Poland, Romania and Slovenia.

Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the British Medical  Association’s consultants committee, said: ‘Only by making working practices and environments safe and sustainable will the NHS  be able to attract and retain the required number and mix of doctors.’

Rehana Azam, of the union GMB which represents NHS staff, added: ‘It’s extremely worrying, particularly as we are facing the toughest winter in years.’

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a GP who sits on the Health Select Committee, said hiring GPs in A&Es could result in even more patients turning up as they realised they could see a doctor more quickly.

She added: ‘We need to make sure it’s easier for people to see a GP out of hospital.’

It emerged yesterday that a third of GPs want to charge patients up to £10 for going to A&E to try to reduce the number of ‘inappropriate’ attendances.

A poll of 800 family doctors by the website doctors.net.uk found that 32 per cent were in favour of fees – with the money being returned to patients if they were seriously ill.

John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Too often extra staff are needed because people turn to A&E when they can’t get a GP appointment.

‘So it’s particularly galling that GPs are then paid so much to provide cover. Providing a genuine out-of-hours service would ease the pressure on A&E, thereby reducing the need for expensive temps.’

Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said: ‘Family doctors are now being pulled into the chaos at England’s hospitals. David Cameron has left A&Es struggling to recruit – and the worse things get, the harder it will become.’

Only a fifth of GPs do any out-of-hours work and those who do undertake an average of four hours a week.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘It’s not unusual for A&E departments to employ in-house GPs – they provide a valuable source of expertise and help patients to be seen and treated promptly.

‘We know that the whole system of out-of-hours care needs to be changed. That’s why we’ve agreed a new GP contract, backed by doctors, which is part of a longer-term plan to bring back the personal link with patients so GPs can focus on giving people the care they need and preventing unnecessary trips to A&E in the first place.’
