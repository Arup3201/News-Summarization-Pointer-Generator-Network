With surprising grace, two winged base jumpers swoop from the mountain's edge. 

Thrilling footage captured on a GoPro camera, shows the wingsuit divers soaring through the air, competing for the fastest time in the World Base Race, 2014.

Filmed in Innfjorden, Norway, the Russian adrenaline junkies can be seen soaring just metres away from the mountain's jagged rocks in an effort to get the quickest time. 

The group: Ratmir Nagimianov 30, Gleb Vorevodin, 37, and Alexey Drozdov, 37, are three of the most experienced jumpers in the world.

But although each of the group were desperate to prove their worth, it was Gleb Vorevodin who managed to outperform the competition and take the title.

Landing safely at the bottom of the 1,300 metre horizontal race course, Gleb managed to complete the route in a staggering time 18.1 seconds.

Gleb said: 'It felt great to take the title, it was a close competition, I had to really push myself to the limit.

'The landscape takes your breath away when you're standing on the edge waiting to jump.

'I have jumped many times before, but the rush you get from base jumping is something you can't reproduce.

'It looks as if I am gliding through the air on the video footage but the speed is really incredible.

'Everyone who took part are highly experienced jumpers, I knew it would be tough to beat anyone of them.

'When you're flying through the air, the adrenaline just takes over and I just forget about anything else.'

Wingsuits, which were first developed in the late 1990s, create a larger surface to the human body, with fabric between the legs and under the arms, enabling a significant increase in flight. On 28 May 2011, Japanese wingsuit diver set world records for the fastest speed reached in a wingsuit of 363 226 mph.

The extreme sport is growing in popularity but remains risky. In 2014 alone, six divers were killed.  

In March,  New Zealander Dan Vicary, 33, Frenchman Ludovic Woerth, 34, and American Brian Drake, 33, were killed after jumping from a helicopter over the Lütschental Alps area near Bern, Switzerland.

In June, Darío Barrio, 42, a famous Spanish TV Chef,  died in an accident while participating in the International Air Festival at Segura de la Sierra in Jaén. And last month, Alex Duncan, a 26 year old Australian from Manly, Sydney, died by crashing into a mountain during a jump in the Swiss Alps.
