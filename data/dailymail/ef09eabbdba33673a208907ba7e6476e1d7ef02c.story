A fake diploma created by artist David Hockney is predicted to sell for £20,000 at auction.

The artist ruined his chances of graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1962 when he spoiled his final exam paper in an act of defiance. 

Hockney, then aged 25, refused to write the essay required, saying he should be judged on his body of work throughout the course.

Celebrated: Artist David Hockney printed 50 copies of his early work 'The Diploma' in 1962, one of which is expected to fetch £20,000

So he created his own certificate by scrawling the word ‘diploma’ beneath the college crest.

The drawing features the official crest of the college at the top of the page and the word diploma written in capital letters in pencil below.

The Diploma: Hockney created this satirical version of the Royal College of Art's certificate after he failed to graduate

Hockney has drawn himself wearing his graduation gown hanging like a protester from the crest with the principal stood below trying to get him down.

The head is depicted with a Hitler moustache and is goose-stepping like a Nazi. There is a monster-like creature with its mouth open behind him about to gobble him up.

Hockney went on to become one of Britain's most famous painters and is well-known for his swimming pool series of work.

The record sum paid for one of his works is five million pounds.

He made 50 copies of The Diploma, and London auctioneers Bloomsbury are selling No 17 on Thursday.

Some of the copies are today held by museums such as the Tate and the V&A.

Ross Thomas, of auctioneers Bloomsbury, said: 'This was Hockney's way of sticking two fingers up at the establishment after he wasn't allowed to finish his final year.

'He believed that his work was more important and relevant than an essay which he refused to write.

'His response was wonderfully satirical. He produced his own diploma, poking fun at the very teachers that refused to pass him.'

The auction takes place in London on June 27.
