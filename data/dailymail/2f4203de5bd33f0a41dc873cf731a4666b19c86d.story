The bloody drug war in Mexico shows no sign of relenting. Neither do calls for tighter border security amid rising fears of spillover violence.

This hardly seems a time the U.S. would be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from Mexico without a customs officer in sight.

But in this rugged, remote West Texas terrain where wading across the shallow Rio Grande undetected is all too easy, federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a security upgrade.

Easy crossing: Guillermo Gonzalez Diaz, wades into the shallow Rio Grande across from Big Bend National Park, Texas on October 31

By the spring, kiosks could open up in
Big Bend National Park allowing people from the tiny Mexican town of 
Boquillas del Carmen to scan their identity documents and talk to a 
customs officer in another location, at least 100 miles (160 kilometres)
away.

The crossing, which would be the 
nation's first such port of entry with Mexico, has sparked opposition 
from some who see it as counter-intuitive in these days of heightened 
border security.

Supporters say the crossing would give the isolated 
Mexican town long-awaited access to U.S. commerce, improve conservation 
efforts and be an unlikely target for criminal operations.

William Wellman, Big
Bend National Park's superintendent, explained: 'People that want to be engaged in 
illegal activities along the border, ones that are engaged in those 
activities now, they're still going to do it. But you'd have to be a real idiot
to pick the only place with security in 300 miles (480 kilometres) of 
the border to try to sneak across.'

The proposed crossing from Boquillas 
del Carmen leads to a vast expanse of rolling scrub, cut by 
sandy-floored canyons and violent volcanic rock outcroppings. The 
Chihuahuan desert wilderness is home to mountain lions, black bears and 
roadrunners, sparsely populated by an occasional camper and others 
visiting the 800,000-acre (320,000-hectare) national park.

Customs and Border Protection, which 
would run the port of entry, says the proposal is a safe way to allow 
access to the town's residents, who currently must travel 240 road miles
(390 road kilometres) to the nearest legal entry point. It also would 
allow park visitors to visit the town.

If the crossing is approved, the 
Border Patrol would have eight agents living in the park in addition to 
the park's 23 law enforcement rangers.

'I think it's actually going to end up making security better,' CBP spokesman William Brooks said.

'Once you've crossed you're still not 
anywhere. You've got a long ways to go and we've got agents who are in 
the area. We have agents who patrol. We have checkpoints on the paved 
roads leading away from the park.'

A public comment period runs through 
December 27 on the estimated $2.3million project, which has support at 
the highest levels of government from both countries.

But U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas 
Republican member of the House Homeland Security committee, questioned 
the wisdom of using resources to make it easier to cross the border.

'We need to use our resources to 
secure the border rather than making it easier to enter in locations 
where we already have problems with illegal crossings,' Mr McCaul said in 
an email.

'There is more to the oversight of legal entry than checking 
documents. (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) needs to be physically 
present at every point of entry in order to inspect for contraband, 
detect suspicious behaviour and, if necessary, act on what they 
encounter.'

While CBP will run the port of entry, 
the National Park Service is the driver behind the project, which it 
hopes will help conservation efforts on both sides of the border. Even 
as the National Park Service has increased cooperation with its Mexican 
counterpart, joint conservation has been limited by the inability of 
personnel to cross the border without making a circuitous 16-hour drive,
Wellman said.

So the National Park Service is 
building the contact station just above the Rio Grande. It will house 
CBP kiosks where crossers will scan in their documents and talk to a 
customs officer in Presidio, the nearest port of entry, or another 
remote location. Park service employees will staff the station, offering
information about the park and guiding people through the process.

Similar ports of entry are already in operation on remote parts of the border with Canada.

'We think we can do this without doing
any damage to national security and possibly enhance security along the
border by having better intelligence, better communication with people 
in Mexico,' Mr Wellman said.

The crossing would also restore a 
long-running relationship between the park, its visitors and the 
residents of Boquillas del Carmen, the town of adobe dwellings set a 
short distance from the river in Mexico.

For years, U.S. tourists added an 
international dimension to their park visit by wading or ferrying in a 
rowboat across the shallow Rio Grande to the town. There they bought 
handicrafts and tacos, providing much-needed cash in the isolated 
community.

But U.S. officials discouraged such 
informal crossings in 2002 after the September 11 terrorist attacks 
prompted calls for tighter border security. Without access to tourists 
or supplies on the U.S. side, the town of just more than 100 people has 
seen a 42 percent drop in population from 2000 to 2010.

Gary Martin, who manages the Rio 
Grande Village store at a nearby park campground, recalls many Mexican 
residents crossing the river to pick up groceries and other necessities.

'We're their supply,' Mr Martin said. 
'They don't have any electricity over there. So they would come here and
buy frozen chicken, cake mixes and things that they couldn't get over 
there.'

Mr Martin tried to stock food items Boquillas del Carmen residents wanted, such as eggs and big sacks of beans.

'After the border closed, well, I got 
rid of most of my food and went back to gifts because I wasn't making 
any money,' Mr Martin said. He estimated about 40 per cent of the store's 
revenue came from Boquillas residents.

Few have risked crossing to the store 
since. 'If they get caught over here they get shipped off,' he said. 
'They get deported all the way to Ojinaga and then they've got to find 
their way home. It's not really worth it.'

Still, most days some Boquillas del 
Carmen residents wade across the river a short distance downstream of 
the old crossing and scramble up to a paved overlook perched high above 
the river.

On boulders near the parking spots 
they lay out painted walking sticks, scorpions and roadrunners crafted 
from copper wire and colourful beads. Each craftsman's work occupies a 
different rock and operates on the honour system with the hope tourists 
will drop four or five dollars in their jar.

'Sometimes we don't sell anything,' 
said Boquillas del Carmen resident Guillermo Gonzalez Diaz. "Sometimes 
we sell one." And other times authorities confiscate everything.

Mr Gonzalez, a 34-year-old father of 
three, described his town as 'very sad, very hard' and said there was no
work. Without access to the Rio Grande Village store, residents depend 
on a bus that runs once a week to Melchor Muzquiz, a larger town about 
150 miles (240 kilometers) away, for supplies.

A small military presence protects the
town from the drug-related violence that has engulfed other Mexican 
border towns. Now with news of the port of entry, residents are already 
making plans for restaurants and shops, he said.

'When it closed nobody crossed and everything went downhill. People began to leave,' he said. 'Now people are going to return.'
