A suspicious email about the death of a DJ-turned-conman was distributed this week

A suspicious email about the death of a DJ-turned-conman was distributed this week, as it was revealed that he racked up $250,000 in debts after setting up numerous fake businesses across Australia.

The letter was sent to media outlets on Tuesday night, including radioinfo, claiming Dene Broadbelt had taken his own life.

In 2014 Fairfax Media unveiled that the young fraudster, who goes by various aliases including Dene Broadbent, Dean Mussillon, Nic Lloyd and Clay O'Connor, had a series of ventures including a charity cancer walk.

The 21-year-old has reportedly moved back to his NSW South Coast home and told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner he had no knowledge of the letter. 

Radioinfo reports the email was sent by 'Jason Blackford', who delivered the news of Mr Broadbelt's supposed death.

'I have to inform everyone of the sad news that Dene Broadbelt died unexpectedly on Saturday night when he took his own life,' the email reads, shared by radioinfo.

'There is to be a memorial service held ASAP (date and time will be announced as soon as possible). We would ask that Dene's final wishes are observed, and there are to be no flowers, donations to World Vision would be welcomed instead.'

A contact number was provided for Mr Broadbelt's mother, Suzanne, for those who needed further details about his funeral service.

Mr Broadbelt has denied being a conman and further rejected claims that he faked his own death

Last year it was reported by Fairfax Media that Mr Broadbelt had incurred debts of more than $120,000 over an 18-month period from a number of scams.

At the time, he said he was filming a Channel Seven charity outback walk for cancer and also claimed to be working as a promoter for a national music festival as well as posing to be a DJ talent agency chief. 

However Mr Broadbelt has denied being a conman and further rejected claims that he faked his own death.

'I am not dead,' he told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner on Wednesday.

'I made a mistake when I was younger... I racked up a few debts, it came to $250,000.

'There was no option other to declare myself bankrupt.'

He further stated that he was not responsible for writing the letter and says he has failed to contact Jason Blackford - a work experience student he had met while working at a radio station in Dubbo, north-west of Sydney.

There had also been claims that Mr Broadbelt had recently tried to establish a real estate agency in Victoria, without a licence, which was also dismissed by the 21-year-old. 

He further told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner he had changed his name to 'Harrison O'Connor' after receiving a number of death threats.
