Ivo Karlovic stunned top-seed Novak Djokovic in the Qatar Open quarter-finals on Thursday.

The big-serving Croatian beat Djokovic when they last met in 2008 and played through a sandstorm to repeat the feat in Doha.

'He served very well,' Djokovic said after going down 6-7 (2), 7-6 (6), 6-4. 'But you could expect that. I was coming into the match knowing that I will have very, very few chances.

'But I was hoping that these conditions and the wind will kind of give me some second-serve opportunities.'

Karlovic managed an impressive 73 first-serve percentage, despite the swirling wind. In the third set, in which he served two aces and two service winners in the final game, he fared even better. 

'I looked at him when he threw the racket and when he smashed the ball, so I knew that he was a little bit frustrated,' said the lanky Croat. 'I was just trying to stay calm.'

He never offered Djokovic a break-point opportunity in the match, and took advantage of a second break point of his own in the seventh game of the third set with a perfect forehand pass.

'In these particular matches, one ball can decide a winner, and that was the case,' Djokovic said. 'I played a little bit too defensive in that game. Instead of kind of going through the ball, I just sent the ball back.'

The lanky Croat edged a close encounter 6-4 in the final set to seal his spot in the last four

Karlovic added 21 aces to his resume for a career total of 9,062. This week, he joined Goran Ivanisevic (10,183) and Andy Roddick (9,074) as the only players since 1991 to serve more than 9,000 aces

Things went from bad to worse for Djokovic, who with Serbian partner Filip Krajinovic, fell in doubles to Rafael Nadal and Juan Monaco, losing 7-6 (3), 6-1. 

In the semi-finals, Karlovic will play David Ferrer, who beat Dustin Brown of Germany 6-2, 6-2, while third-seeded Tomas Berdych will meet Andreas Seppi of Italy in the other last four-encounter. 

Berdych downed sixth-seeded Richard Gasquet of France 6-2, 6-1 and Seppi saw off Croatia's Ivan Dodig 7-5, 6-4.
