David Cameron has vowed to push ahead with NHS reforms despite mounting opposition from most of the medical profession.

The Prime Minister threw his weight behind beleaguered Health Secretary Andrew Lansley before the health and social care Bill returns to the House of Lords today.

Labour peers will seek to disrupt the passage of the Bill, which will hand more power to doctors and lead to greater choice for patients.

Mr Lansley has tabled more than 100 amendments to the 
bill, which has been passed by the Commons, in an effort to push it 
through the Lords

Mr Cameron’s refusal to shelve the Bill 
came as a poll by the British Medical Journal found that more than 90 
per cent of its readers believe the reforms should be axed.

More than 50,000 people have also signed an e-petition calling for the Bill to be scrapped, including footballer Rio Ferdinand, comedian Stephen Fry and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

Mr Lansley’s position looked precarious yesterday after a Downing Street source was quoted as saying that he ‘should be taken out and shot’ because ‘he has messed up the communication and the substance of the policy’.

Claims
 also surfaced that there have been discussions within No 10 about 
ennobling Alan Milburn to allow the former Labour health secretary to 
take his place.

But 
asked whether the Prime Minister remained confident that the reforms 
would improve the NHS, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Yes. The purpose of these reforms is to give 
NHS staff more freedom from bureaucracy and political interference, so 
they can get on with their job, which is caring for patients.’

The
 Royal College of GPs, the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal 
College of Psychiatrists have all stated their opposition to the Bill.

The
 British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
 College of Midwives have also called for it to be withdrawn.

Last night a leading peer attempted to use the death of Mr Cameron’s son Ivan at the age of six in 2009 for political advantage.

David Owen, a qualified doctor, said the Prime Minister was wrong to use his experiences with Ivan, who suffered from a rare form of epilepsy and cerebral palsy, to convince voters the NHS was safe in his hands.

Unlikely allies? Footballer Rio Ferdinand 
and comedian Stephen Fry are among 50,000 people to have signed an 
e-petition calling for the Bill to be scrapped

Cross-bencher Lord Owen, a former Labour Foreign Secretary and SDP leader, is leading attempts to derail the Bill.

A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘These comments are rather tasteless.’
