Attacker: The couple, from Upper Milford Township in Pennsylvania, want to get away from Oliver Larry Beck but they claim his presence in the neighborhood has made their property impossible to sell

The family of a young girl sexually abused by a neighbor two years ago is trying to make her attacker buy their home, in a groundbreaking lawsuit.

The couple, from Upper Milford Township in Pennsylvania, want to get away from Oliver Larry Beck but they claim his presence in the neighborhood has made their property impossible to sell.

In the first suit of its kind, the unnamed couple are asking a judge to force the 65-year-old, his wife and his mother to buy their residence, at a cost of $235,000, and pay for them to move.

In addition, the family is going after damages for the child's pain and suffering caused by the 2011 molestation.

Beck was sentenced to almost two years in jail after he pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting the child. Investigators said he lured the victim into his basement by telling her he wanted to show her a bear's head mounted on the wall. After telling the girl to feel the bear, he made her take off her clothes then assaulted her.

The child's father found out and called police. The family allege Beck assaulted their daughter, who he used to take on drives, play games and give candy and sweets to, multiple times between 2009 and 2011.

After Beck was released from prison, he resumed his old address, but the victim's family claim in the lawsuit that they're 'under duress' to move house now he's back living in the neighborhood.

Legal experts say this is the first time a lawsuit has attempted to force a defendant to buy a home, and many believe a judge wouldn't even have the power grant such a request.

'I have never heard of that and the court may say it has no authority to order that,' University of Virginia Law School professor Douglas Laycock told The Morning Call.

'If the house, in fact, lost value, and if the owners are entitled to recover for that, that value can be awarded in damages without transferring ownership of the house.

'Selling the house to the offender might be a sensible part of a settlement, but it would be odd as a court-ordered remedy.'

St. John's University associate law professor Anthony Sabino told the newspaper that making Beck buy the home could be deemed unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment.

But a sexual assault survivor and executive director of the Victim/Witness Assistance Program in Harrisburg Jennifer Storm said she thinks the creative request would set a positive precedent.

'I applaud any effort that a victim can take to ensure their well-being,' Storm told the newspaper. 'I think this could be a good case to potentially set precedent.'

In a court brief filed this month, Beck's lawyer Robert Magee said the lawsuit's demand for the home purchase is 'not appropriate or authorized under a legal or equitable theory,' according to the Morning Call.

He said that the family is still able to use and enjoy their home.

Previous cases asking for damages because an undesirable development has made their house difficult to sell have been dismissed, with the Pennsylvania court claiming: 'Any time a property owner engaged in an activity that ostensibly reduced surrounding property values, liability would attach.'

Meanwhile, the lawsuit accuses Beck of sexual assault, negligence and inflicting emotional distress, among other allegations.

Beck's wife and mother are accused of negligence in the document, with the family claiming they knew or should have known of Beck's attraction to children and the risk he posed to their young neighbors.

The little girl suffered emotional distress, shame and embarrassment and will need indefinite therapy to deal with the abuse, the suit says.

Homeowners selling up are not required to inform potential buyers that a sex offender lives next-door, but the family said they would feel obliged to tell the new owners, in case he strikes again.

Research shows, having a listed sex offender in the neighborhood drops home prices by between 4 and 12 per cent.
