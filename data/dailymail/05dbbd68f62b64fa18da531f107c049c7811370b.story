Mike Merrill found life as a customer service rep at a small software company in Oregon less than fulfilling.

What he would much rather be doing was pursuing his passion as an entrepreneur.

He had loads of great ideas and ambitions, but no venture capital to live the dream.

Creative: Mike Merrill decided to solve his cash flow problem by selling himself off to shareholders online

His answer? Sell himself on the open market.

He divided himself into 100,000 shares at $1 a piece, with the promise of returns on any profits he made outside his day job.

That was in 2008 and before long a handful of friends and even his girlfriend bought a total of 929 shares. It was only 0.9 per cent, but he at least ended up with some extra cash.

He set up a website KmikeyM.com where anyone could buy into him, with the initial idea to create an open-ended version of crowd-funding website Kickstarter, he told The Atlantic.

Unusual businessman: Merrill promised returns on any profits he made outside his day job to his investors

Shareholder approval: Merrill is so dedicated to his investors that the can vote on all aspects of his life

But instead of just one project, investors would get a say in which ideas he pursued.

For example, he put whether he should make a short video to market his shares to a vote, but shareholders decided instead to invest $80 in a Rwandan chicken farmer.

Very soon he found they wanted to ballot on his private life, too,  it was reported by www.wired.com.

The issue came to a head when his girlfriend and shareholder, Willow McCormick, moved in with him, something the other shareholders feared would affect their investments.

After all, if he was going to spend more time at home with Willow, he would have less time to pursue their interests.

Merrill had not envisaged giving them any control, but gradually came round to the idea.

'I
figured they'd make good decisions for me, since they had money on the 
line and wanted to see their investment appreciate,' Merrill, 35, told Wired.

He was so taken with the new slant on his 
scheme that he asked the shareholders whether he should get a vasectomy, 
given that the 'time investment of raising a child is immense.'

Extreme entrepreneur: Mike Merrill's shareholders started pushing for a say in private as well as professional life, including who he dates and when he has children

McCormick was livid. 'He made our personal life public without consulting me,' she said.

To her, it was a referendum on whether she would be a suitable mother.

By pulling favours with some of the other
shareholders, she managed to get the vasectomy rejected 456 votes to 
387, but it was the beginning of the end for them. After five years 
together, they decided to split.

Lucrative: Merrill's graph shows how his stock has appreciated in value since 2008 up to a high of $20

'I felt like our relationship didnâ€™t come first in his life,' she said. 'The Mike I knew got swallowed up by KmikeyM.'

Despite such setbacks, Merrill maintains that having investors 'holding me accountable' has improved his life.

As for the investors, the values of their shares rise and fall, purely on the basis of demand.

A demand in making decisions that keep him productive - whether it was boosting his workout regime with martial-arts classes or registering as a Republican. They are currently trading at $11 a piece.

As for his love life, according to The Atlantic, he now has another girlfriend with whom he has just renewed his 'contract' for another three months - with shareholder approval, of course.
