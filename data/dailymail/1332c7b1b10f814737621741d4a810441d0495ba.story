Hitting back: Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul

Turkey deepened its acrimonious rift with France yesterday by accusing the country of genocide.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan claimed French forces burned people in ovens during their colonial occupation of Algeria.

He told President Nicolas Sarkozy he should ask his ex-Foreign Legion father about atrocities carried out during French imperial rule in the 1940s and 1950s.

The charge was a bitter retaliation against French MPs’ decision 24 hours earlier to make it a crime to deny that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 constituted genocide.

But the widening gulf between France and its strategic ally and trading partner looks set to have repercussions far beyond settling accounts over some of the bloodiest episodes of the last century.

France invaded Algeria in 1830 and subjected its largely Muslim inhabitants to 132 years of colonial rule.

Backlash: Turkish riot police stand guard in front of the French Consulate in Istanbul after France approved a bill which would make it illegal to deny the mass killing of Armenians in 1915 by Ottoman Turks was genocide

Fury: Protesters outside the consulate in Istanbul. Turkey has withdrawn its ambassador and promised further action after the bill was passed today

Mr Erdogan said that from 1945, an 
estimated 15 per cent of the population was massacred by the French.

Some were ‘mercilessly martyred’ when they were burned in ovens, he 
said. ‘What the French did in Algeria was genocide,’ Mr Erdogan added on
live television.

‘If Mr Sarkozy doesn’t know about this genocide, he 
should go and ask his father, Pal Sarkozy.

‘His father served in the French Legion in Algeria in the 1940s. I am 
sure he would have lots to tell his son about the French massacres in 
Algeria.’

Mr Sarkozy senior dismissed the comments as ‘completely ridiculous’.

He 
told French TV: ‘I have never been to Algeria. I’ve never been beyond 
Marseille and I was in the Foreign Legion for just four months.’

His son, speaking in Prague, where he attended the funeral of former 
Czech president Vaclav Havel, responded calmly to Mr Erdogan’s comments.
‘I respect the convictions of our Turkish friends,’ said Mr Sarkozy.

‘It’s a great country with a great civilisation, [but] it has to respect
our convictions.’

Controversial: French riot police outside the National Assembly building in Paris

French foreign minister Alain Juppe described Turkey’s reaction as ‘in 
all likelihood excessive’, but said: ‘There are many reasons to keep 
alive a relationship of trust and friendship.’

French MPs voted 
overwhelmingly on Thursday for a draft law outlawing genocide denial 
over the Armenian massacres.

Although nearly a century has passed since the killings in the middle of
the First World War, the vast majority of Turks feel the charge of 
genocide is an insult to their nation.

Turkey argues that killings took 
place on all sides during a fierce partisan conflict.

Mr Erdogan condemned the French bill shortly after the vote, recalled 
Ankara’s ambassador to France for consultations and cancelled all joint 
economic, political and military meetings.

Yesterday he said: ‘We will 
take gradual measures as long as the current French attitude is 
maintained.

‘The vote . . . has shown how dangerous racism, discrimination and Islamophobia have become in France and Europe.’

Almost from the day in 1830 that the French seized it as a colony, Algeria’s story was one of brutality and repression.

Bent on exploiting the country for its natural resources, the colonial rulers regarded their Muslim subjects as an inferior species and responded to any resistance with a policy of indiscriminate slaughter.

In one particularly hideous early episode, French forces trapped civilians in caves and set bonfires at the entrances, so they had to choose between dying from smoke or flames.

French troops tend to an injured demonstrator in Algiers in 1962

Over the first 30 years of French rule, 
the population shrank from a pre-colonial peak of 4million to an 
estimated 2.3million, and fresh outbreaks of violence were common 
throughout the next century.

They culminated in the 1950s  in an eight-year war of independence that 
still ranks among the bloodiest conflicts of the last century.

France has never accepted that atrocities carried out in the 1954-1962 
war, when thousands were tortured and massacred, were acts of genocide.

The seeds of the rebellion were sown between the two world wars, when 
Algerian resistance groups and nationalist movements grew stronger.

In 1945, demonstrations throughout Algeria called for independence. 
French security forces put them down with the usual brute force, and 
shot dead a protester waving a banned Algerian flag, sparking  a 
reaction that engulfed the country in riots. In the violence that 
followed, 45,000 Algerians were killed over a few days, according to 
Algerian figures. Many were burned in ovens, it is alleged, to destroy 
the evidence of carnage.

Turkey appeared to suggest yesterday that some were thrown into the 
ovens while still alive, though there is no validated evidence for this.

By 1950, French Foreign Legion troops were helping to track down and 
eliminate revolutionaries, and an ‘uprising’ compelled France to commit 
400,000 soldiers.

In a chilling echo of another war that had only recently ended, they set
up concentration camps, tortured prisoners and carried out mass 
executions of civilians suspected of aiding the rebels.

The bloody war continued until 1962, when the French withdrew.

Algeria suffered a death toll variously estimated at between 500,000 and 1.5million.

And there was more atrocity to come. Thousands of Muslim Algerian 
‘Harkis’ – pro-French volunteers – who had fought alongside French 
troops were abandoned to face bloody reprisals in their homeland.

Estimates are that at least 30,000, possibly as many as 150,000, were 
slaughtered by republican supporters after the Evian peace accord was 
signed in March 1962.

France, it is alleged, turned a blind eye.
