With just over a month to go until she joins Team GB for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, Zara Phillips appears to be pulling out all the stops to prove that motherhood hasn't blunted her competitive edge.

Competing at the Dauntsey Park Horse Trials in Wiltshire, the 33-year-old Olympic silver medallist looked in tip top shape as she braved a difficult course in blazing sunshine.

But it wasn't all hard work, for watching from the sidelines was the royal's six-month-old baby daughter Mia who was being looked after by a friend while her mother tackled the enormous jumps.

Competitive: Zara is currently preparing for the World Equestrian Games which take place next month

Zara's riding career, put on hold during her pregnancy and for the first few months of Mia's life, is slowly cranking back into top gear as the World Equestrian Games approach.

Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough - with baby Mia once more among the crowds.

Late June saw her enjoy a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire, watched by husband Mike Tindall, 36, and another outing at the Hopetoun Horse Trials in Edinburgh.

But successful though most of her outings have been, it is the World Equestrian Games that are at the forefront of her mind, particularly as Team GB selectors for Rio 2016 will be in the crowd.

Hot work: Zara's Olympic horse High Kingdom was also back in action and will compete in France next month

Competing alongside Zara in Normandy will be the rest of the current Team GB, among them world number one William Fox-Pitt and fellow Olympic medallist Tina Cook.

The World Equestrian Games will also see the return of Zara's Olympic horse High Kingdom who, like his mistress, has been warming up with smaller British events at Dauntsey, Barbury and Salperton.

Kicking off on the 23rd August, the Games include eight different disciplines, among them eventing, showjumping, dressage and endurance.

The latter, as the name suggests, involves a 160km race that takes place over the course of a single day with the majority of participants plumping for hardy Arab horses.
