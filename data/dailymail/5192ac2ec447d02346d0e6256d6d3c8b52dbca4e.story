Police have arrested two teenagers in connection with racist abuse posted on a Premier League footballer's Twitter account.

Sammy Ameobi, 19, who plays for Newcastle United alongside older brother Shola, was called a 'n****r' after the footballer tweeted a photo of a black pair of boots.

Ameobi, who broke into the 
first team at the end of last season and is becoming a fans' favourite, 
retweeted the abuse he received, and his attacker's account was closed 
down.

Ameobi had posted a message alongside
the photo of the Nike boots, saying: 'There will always be a place in 
my heart for the all blacks.'

A follower with the username @JonnnnyPhipps replied: 'Your hand is nearly the same colour. n****r.'

Retweeting the message, Ameobi added: 'Sad to see some people are still racist nowadays.'

Both Newcastle United and the player reported the matter to police.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said today: 'On Wednesday November 2 Northumbria Police arrested two young men, both aged 17, on suspicion of malicious communication.

'The arrests come after reports of a racist tweet being sent to one of the region's professional sportsmen.'

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: 
'We represent the local community here and when something like this 
happens we have to react strongly.

'We will not tolerate any type of behaviour like that.

'With the austerity measures and 
everybody feeling a bit tight, everybody is feeling a bit narrow-minded 
and racism is coming to the fore, so maybe it is not a bad thing.

'We have been leading the world, the 
football world, in terms of dealing with it and maybe we should not 
become complacent in keeping a lid on it.'

The police investigation follows allegations of racial abuse directed at Anton Ferdinand of QPR and the Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.

England captain John Terry is facing an investigation after it was claimed he racially abused Ferdinand during an altercation on the pitch.

It is claimed he called the defender a ‘'f***ing black ****’. during an argument.

After spending a week 'assessing' a complaint from a member of the public, officers will now interview Ferdinand over the episode at Loftus Road 11 days ago.

Terry insists he only spoke aggressively to deny his 26-year-old opponent's accusation of racist abuse.
