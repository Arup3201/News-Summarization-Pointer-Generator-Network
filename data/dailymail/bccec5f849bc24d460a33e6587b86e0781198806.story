Prince Harry landed in South Africa this morning for a brief stopover on his way to Antarctica for a gruelling trek to the South Pole.

The Prince looked upbeat and smiled as got off the plane with injured service personnel taking part in the Walking With The Wounded challenge.

Three teams of four wounded military personnel, representing Britain, the United States and the Commonwealth (drawn from Australia and Canada) will race 335-kilometre (210-mile) across Antarctica.

The 29-year-old army attack helicopter pilot will trek alongside the British team in the charity race to the planet's southernmost point, which is expected to take 16 days.

Upbeat: Prince Harry looked relaxed as he landed in Cape Town, South Africa, today with the rest of the Walking with the Wounded British team mates

Pit stop: Prince Harry travelled with 12 wounded servicemen and women from the UK to Cape Town ahead of a 200-mile race across Antarctica

After arriving in Cape Town on a flight from London today, the Prince joined his team mates on a bus ride to a local hotel where they could relax for the evening.

The teams will tomorrow fly on to an air base near Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station, which is situated at the edge of the Antarctic continent.

Once acclimatised to the altitude and freezing temperatures, the teams hope to begin the race on November 29. They aim to reach the South Pole around December 17.

Each team has a mentor and a polar guide.

Harry is patron of organisers Walking With The Wounded, which raises funds to retrain injured troops and help them find new careers outside the military.

Calm before the storm: Prince Harry join other members of the British team in the team bus which headed to a nearby hotel along the coast for some relaxation time before leaving for the South Pole

Keeping calm: The Prince didn't seem at all daunted by the challenge ahead

He launched the charity's South Pole Allied Challenge in London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday.

'All the men and women behind me have achieved so much just to get here, let alone actually walk to the South Pole,' he said, flanked by the competitors. 'It's just a wonderful display of courage from their part.

'These guys aim to achieve something quite remarkable, and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even though you've lost a leg or lost an arm, or whatever your illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.'

He added: 'This trip is another way of reminding everybody that as Afghanistan draws down and these guys aren't in the news any more... the support must continue.'

Trekking around 20 kilometres per day, the teams will be pulling 70-kilogramme (155-pound) sleds.They
 will likely endure temperatures as low as minus 35 degrees Celsius 
(minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit) and wind speeds of around 50 miles (80 
kilometres) per hour.

Preparation: The teams will all fly on to a Russian base in Antarctica tomorrow where they will be given a few days to acclimatise to the freezing weather conditions

Speaking at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday before departing, British army veteran Ibrar Ali, whose right arm was amputated after a roadside bombing in Afghanistan in 2007, felt both nervous and excited about the challenge ahead.

'A bit like pre-tour when you're just about sat at Brize Norton (airbase) when you're just about to go out to Iraq or Afghanistan,' he said.

Speaking of Harry's involvement, he added: 'He's a great team member and just fits in really well so no different to anyone else.'

Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, joined the Walking With The Wounded trek to the North Pole in 2011.

However, he had to come home early to be best man at his brother Prince William's wedding.

Members of the team carry equipment that will be vital on on their trek to the South Pole
