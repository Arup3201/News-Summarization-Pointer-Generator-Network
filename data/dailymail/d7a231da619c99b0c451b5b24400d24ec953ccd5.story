One is a newly-pruned tree, the other is Ren, a cartoon Chihuahua from the popular Ren & Stimpy Show.

But can you tell which is which?

Walkers in the woods near Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, were surprised to see their favourite cartoon character staring down at them today.

Photographer Paul Marriott, who took the picture of the tree, said: 'I was out taking some pictures of the weather in the woods when I saw this tree that appeared to be staring at me.

'I thought it looked a bit like a voodoo mask at first, and it felt quite spooky out there in the woods.Â  But when I got closer I saw it looked even more like Ren from The Ren & Stimpy Show.

'I have never seen a tree look like a cartoon character before.'

Ren is the skinny, asthmatic Chihuahua with huge bulging eyes who stars in the Nickolodeon cartoon series he shares with his sidekick Stimpy, a dim-witted cat.

In the show, Ren is quick to anger and usually takes it out on Stimpy by slapping him in the face or beating him up.

The animated series was hugely popular both here and in its native north America, and ran for five seasons in the 1990s.

Centred on characters created by John Kricfalusi, The Ren & Stimpy Show developed a cult following despite attracting criticism for its off-colour jokes, sexual innuendo and violence.

The show has been credited with paving the way for satirical, animated shows like Beavis and Butt-head and South Park.
