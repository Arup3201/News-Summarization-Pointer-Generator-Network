For Downing Street’s first woman tenant, this felt like home from home. In early 1992, Mrs Thatcher moved to spacious new offices in a fine Georgian house in Chesham Place, Belgravia, where her combined sitting room and study was arranged to look very much like the working space she’d had at No. 10.

She worked in a high-backed chair by the fireplace, looking at papers with the help of a huge magnifying glass — she wilfully refused to wear reading glasses — underlining, marking marginalia, gathering odds and ends together in files, and then forgetting where she had put them.

The room was dominated by an extraordinary portrait of her by a Russian artist, which she liked because it made her look very thin and intellectual. Her staff hated it and referred to it as Nosferatu.

Dotted around were busts of Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill and her husband, Denis.

A rather unnerving bronze impression of her own hands, sliced off at the wrists, perched on a ledge. Bowls, dishes and statues were frequently moved around as the fancy took her.

She needed no help with this, being immensely strong in the arms. There was not a stuck window or jammed door she could not shift — and, being impatient, she would sometimes use this strength in disregard of her personal safety.

She would go out onto the balcony at home to force open the French windows, presenting herself obligingly profiled for any sniper.

In her office, her desk and cupboards were stuffed with pamphlets and photocopied articles and speeches. When in search of ideas, she would get down on her knees and rummage through them.

A glass-fronted bookcase was full of her favourite volumes, selected for inspiration rather than continuous reading, which she rarely practised.

She preferred to dip into books and extract whatever she found useful in them without worrying too much about what the author’s conclusions actually were.

In her handbag, she always carried around a tiny volume of extracts from Churchill’s speeches and broadcasts.

Many of her most heavily thumbed books were of poetry: Kipling (naturally) and Palgrave’s Golden Treasury. She was over-fond of quoting, not realising that what she herself had to say was more noteworthy. She became enthralled by a book of sayings from U.S. Presidents and was annoyed when Denis threw it out with the rubbish — by mistake, or so he claimed.

She was not modest about her achievements, and the offices were packed with memorabilia of past glories and triumphs — Cabinet and G7 summit photographs, watercolours of Chequers and scenes from the Falklands campaign.

Yet the offices still had a distinctive femininity. Every week, a friend sent beautiful flowers whose perfume filled the air, adding to Mrs Thatcher’s own, for she wore a heavy scent, usually Chanel No. 5. At home in Chester Square, she displayed rows of snuffboxes, together with silver, china and photographs.

She was particularly fond of one showing her with the Queen and the Queen Mother at Balmoral.

She got on much better with the Queen than is frequently imagined, albeit with greater warmth in her last years. But she had greatest regard for the Queen Mother, who reciprocated it.

On one wall of the sitting room was a painting by Nick Ridley — her former minister, and a talented artist — of Downing Street. A mixed bag of other paintings of different styles, some surprisingly risqué, adorned the entrance hall and bordered the staircase.

In these surroundings, year by year after leaving office, she worked at an immense pace to further her ideas and to advance British interests overseas — no one was ever more effective at securing a contract for some British firm than Mrs Thatcher.

Needless to say, she neither sought nor received any benefit from doing so.
