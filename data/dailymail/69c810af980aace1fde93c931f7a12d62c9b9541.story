A police station had to be sealed off for three hours after officers spilled a bottle of party drug GBL onto the carpet.

Firefighters spent three hours decontaminating the office, after the chemical spilled from a half-litre plastic bottle.

The colourless Class C drug, which is an irritant, was being stored as evidence at Brighton police station in East Sussex  when the incident took place.

No-one was harmed or came into contact with the liquid, but Sussex police said an investigation has been launched. 

GBL - the full name of which is gammabutyrolacton - is converted to chemical gammahydroxybutrate (GHB), or 'liquid Ecstasy', after entering the body.

The drug, sometimes referred to as 'coma in a bottle', produces a feeling of euphoria, sleepiness and reduces inhibitions. 

Its cheap price makes it a popular party drug. It has been blamed for several deaths, including Sussex University medical student Hester Stewart in 2009.

Sussex Police has launched an investigation into the incident. There were no reported injuries and no-one came into contact with the drug, which is also an irritant

GBL and GHB are also used by date rapists to spike drinks because it is odourless and colourless and can be out of a victim’s system within 12 hours. 

The drug is available for legitimate use in industry. But if someone supplies or possesses the drug, knowing or believing it will be swallowed and ingested, they are committing an offence.

Possession is punishable by up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine, while suppliers can face up to four years in jail. 

GBL is an odourless liquid sold in small bottles or capsules, costing about £15 for 30ml.

It is usually diluted with water or juice and is virtually tasteless, but produces a high not dissimilar to ecstasy. It can damage the kidneys, liver and the stomach lining and can lead to psychosis.

Once in the body, chemical reactions turn GBL into now notorious drug GHB - known as 'liquid Ecstasy' - which was banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug.

Although legal for use in the chemical industry - in cleaning products, solvents and paints - it has been banned for recreational use since 2009 and is a Class C drug. 

Overdoses are common, with as little as one teaspoon enough to put the user in a coma. That is how the nickname 'coma in a bottle' came about. 

Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Sarah O'Dowd, 24, who drowned in her bath in October 2007.

Lynette Nock, 28, died in 2012 after taking the drug. She was at a memorial party for her friend Carl Fearon, who had died after taking the drug the day before. 

Brighton medical student Hester Stewart died in April 2009 after taking GBL and drinking alcohol.

A 25-year-old man died hours after taking GBL on its own while out clubbing in 2008.

But because traces of GBL remain in the body for only up to 12 hours after consumption, the true number of fatalities is unknown. 

Anyone caught in possession of the drug can face an unlimited fine and up to two years in prison. Suppliers can face up to four years in jail.
