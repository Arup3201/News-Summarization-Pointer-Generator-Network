A disabled woman was strangled to death by her husband as she begged him to stop after he suffered delusions that they were broke and about to be evicted, a court heard.

Nigel Talman, 60, called police and admitted throttling his wife of 20 years, Sandra, at the retirement complex they shared in Newbury, Berkshire, last August.

He had been suffering from psychosis and delusions during a sudden spiral into severe depression and was jailed for six years today.

Talman, wearing a black suit and white shirt, showed no emotion as details of the killing were read out to the court and dozens of tearful family members. 

Prosecuting, William Mousley QC, told the court how Mrs Talman, 62, had been sleeping on the sofa when she was awoken by her husband's hands tightening around her neck.

He said she opened her eyes and begged him to 'please stop,' but he ignored her pleas and squeezed tight for up to two minutes until she stopped struggling.

The mother-of-three, who walked with a frame and had a mobility scooter, attempted to fend him off, scratching her husband with her nails. 

The court heard how Talman, a former exemplary Thames Water employee, had lost his grip on reality as he descended into a mental crisis in the weeks before the killing.

He became paranoid his neighbours were watching him, struggled to sleep and would periodically turn off all the lights and prevent his wife from making phone calls, the jury was told.

Talman, who was due to retire imminently, became convinced that the couple had no money and would become homeless.

However, police who carried out a financial audit after the killing, found Talman's fears about bailiffs were entirely unfounded, as he had plenty of money in the bank.

The court heard that by August Talman was being seen by health professionals on an almost-daily basis, but he was finding no relief in his medication and had only had one counselling appointment.

In her final days Mrs Talman confided in her sisters about her fears for her safety as her husband's mental condition declined further.

She told sister Wendy: 'I can't chuck him out because I still love the old b******.'

Officers were called to the couple's house at 7.28am on August 17 after Talman rang police to confess to the killing.

Mrs Talman's body was found on the couch where she had been sleeping and a post mortem examination showed the cause of death was compression of the neck.

Less than 24 hours before, a nurse had visited the home to prescribe Talman diazepam to help with his chronic insomnia and he was scheduled to see a consultant on the following Monday.

However, his mental health had deteriorated the day before he throttled his wife, as he had called 999 to get an ambulance for Mrs Talman, believing she was ill.

Paramedics who came to the house were more concerned about Talman's health but he successfully masked the full extent of his problems in front of them.

Talman was arrested and charged the following day with his wife's murder but prosecutors dropped the initial charge after two psychologists agreed that Talman was so depressed he was not able to think clearly at the time he killed his wife.

Talman previously admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility when he appeared before a judge at Reading Crown Court.

The court heard how troubled Talman had felt he had 'no way out' of his mental prison, stopping to take the medication and making frequent crisis calls to mental health teams.

Appealing for leniency on account of Talman's delusional beliefs that he was carrying out a mercy killing, Sally Ann Hales QC, defending, said he was 'appalled' at what he had done.

'Mr Talman did not plan to kill his wife,' she said. 'He has expressed remorse, he feels remorse, and this offence would never have happened but for the fact that he was demonstrably very unwell.

'It wasn't premeditated, it wasn't planned but (quoting Talman) "I didn't want Sandra to be part of the mess I had created".

'It was this kind of "mess" he wanted to stop, rather than Sandra per se.

'It is evident that by August 16 the calm, unflappable and reliable man known to his family, had changed beyond recognition.'

Ms Hales added: 'One would think what happened to him could almost happen to any one of us, because his life, until now, had been pretty unremarkable.'

The couple had been together for more than 20 years after he separated from his first wife in 1993.

Talman had left school aged 16 years and started working at Thames Water when he was aged 25 years, where colleagues described him as 'easy going' and 'kind.'

He had a daughter, Sarah, from his first marriage, and Mrs Talman had three sons, Stephen, Nicky and Sam, from a previous relationship.

In a moving victim impact statement, her son Stephen paid tribute to his 'kind, loving mother,' who had battled cancer but 'never gave up.'

His brother Nicky was one of several family members who spoke of night terrors they have experienced since Mrs Talman's death, saying he was haunted by nightmares in which Talman was chasing him.

Her sister Wendy said: 'The day I received the phone call was the worst day of my life.

'The first person I wanted to call was Sandra. She was always the first up dancing, having fun. Even with her disabilities she was always enjoying life.'

Sentencing Talman to six years behind bars, a judge said he took the defendant's severe mental health problems into account but that he had to bear some responsibility for his actions.

Judge John Reddihough said: 'On the morning of August 17 you strangled to death your 62-year-old wife Sandra, a woman who had been together with you for some 20 years.

'Clearly she had a zest for life, she was greatly loved and will be missed by her family and friends.

'In the days before her death, despite your behaviour, she was still professing her continuing love for you.'

He said psychiatrists agreed Talman had been 'very unwell' with a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and insomnia ahead of the attack, with 'delusions of poverty' consuming him.

There was said to be little risk, now Talman's illness had been successfully treated in prison with a mix of antidepressants and vital antipsychotics, of him re-offending.

'Sentencing in cases such as this that arise, at least in part, due to mental distress, is never straightforward,' Judge Reddihough continued.

'Although it is clear from the psychiatric evidence your mental responsibility for killing your wife was diminished, in my judgement, a not insignificant amount of responsibility remained.

'You made the decision not to take all your medication. Certainly you were able to mask the extent of your mental health difficulties.

'At the time of your offence you were able to make up your mind to kill your wife. You knew she was vulnerable to attack because of her health.

'She put up a struggle. You ignored her. You were strangling her for a considerable amount of time, because by then you were determined to kill her. You took the life of another human being.'

Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said they had discussed dropping the murder charge with Mrs Talman's family.

He said: 'When Talman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, we carefully and thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in this case, including the assessment of psychiatric experts.

'In light of all the evidence, we took the view that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction for murder.

'We fully discussed our decision to accept the plea with Sandra's family. We hope that the conviction and today's sentence brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done.'

Investigating officer Chief Inspector Ailsa Kent said: 'This is a desperately sad case and although today's decision will never bring Sandra back, I hope it will go some way to helping Sandra's family and friends feel that justice has been done.'
