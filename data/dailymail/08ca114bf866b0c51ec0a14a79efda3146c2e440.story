Guilty: Caroline Butler made numerous fraudulent housing, council tax, employment support and income support claims over a two-year period

A benefit cheat who stole nearly £18,000 from the taxpayer tried to hide her relationship with the father of her children from investigators by pretending to be a lesbian.

Caroline Butler made numerous fraudulent housing, council tax, employment support and income support claims over a two-year period, a court has heard.

When fraud investigators probed into the scam, the 42-year-old denied being in a relationship with Andrew Donaldson - the father of her three children - claiming she was only interested in women.

Butler told magistrates she had only known her employed partner for five years before moving into her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

However, she revised this to 15 years after investigators from Rochdale Council and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) produced her eldest child’s birth certificate, which named Mr Donaldson as the father.

But the mother-of-three still denied their relationship - claiming she was a lesbian and Mr Donaldson was not the child's biological father.

She said her children, aged nine to 13, all had different dads and the 56-year-old was just a 'friend'.

Butler then stormed out of a second interview with investigators after admitting he had been living with her for six months, Manchester City Magistrates Court heard.

She was arrested and charged with fraud offences by failing to inform the DWP that she was living with Mr Donaldson as ‘husband and wife’ - meaning he could have financially supported her.

Butler, of Chatburn Avenue, Castleton, denied four counts of dishonesty under the Fraud Act.

However, magistrates found her guilty of fraudulently claiming benefits totalling £17,990 between 2010 and 2012.

She was ordered to repay the full amount, in addition to £400 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

She was also handed a 12-month community order, with 225 hours of unpaid work.

Councillor Farooq Ahmed, Rochdale Council’s 
cabinet member for finance, said: 'It is saddening to hear about the 
lengths some people go to when attempting to support fraudulent claims.'

Speaking about the council following the hearing, Butler said: 'They don’t know me. They don’t know nothing about me.

'They’ve carried on sending me letters. They better stop harassing me or I’ll report them.'

Unbelievably, she claimed the authority owed her cash from 2006 after the 'damp' council house she previously lived in ‘ruined’ her belongings and left her ill. 

In a previous interview, she said: 'I’ve still not had any compensation from them after all I went through. I put in a claim and they offered me a £50 goodwill gesture.'
