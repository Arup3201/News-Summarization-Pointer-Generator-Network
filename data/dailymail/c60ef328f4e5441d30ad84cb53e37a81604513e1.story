Nathan Tinkler will see the majority of his property and racing empire dismantled this week in the country's largest horse sale.

The coal investor is reportedly over $40 million in debt to Magic Millions boss Gerry Harvey, who initiated the dispersal sale of Mr Tinkler's Patinack Farm property at his Gold Coast sale yard on Sunday.

The sale will end Mr Tinkler's foray into horse breeding and racing, but will hopefully pave the way towards financial stability, with the first day at auction seeing over $21 million in sales. 

The auction was the first of four organised by Mr Harvey for the 447-hectare Patinack Farm property in Beaudesert, Queensland, and includes more than 500 breeding and racing thoroughbreds.

The property will be available in quarter portions, comprising Wadham Park, Elysium Fields, Sarahvale and Benoble estates.

Mr Tinkler invested a staggering $300 million into the property, which took six years to build, before Patinack Farm was sequestered by Mr Harvey in August.

Earlier in the year the property was reported to be in sale negotiations with overseas interest, but the sale did not see fruition. The deal would have allowed Mr Tinkler to continue his proposed investment in Peabody Coal for the Wilkie Creek mine.

There were high hopes for the sale, with expectations of at least one thoroughbred going under the hammer for $1 million.

The horses up for auction included Hooked, the winner of last week's Newcastle Cameron Handicap.

The largest sale for Patinack was $850, 000 for lot 455, Bel Mer, who is in foal to champion thoroughbred All Too Hard, who was also purchased by South Australian breeding operation Goldin Farms. 

Other top sellers included Dreams and Wishes, bought by John Singleton’s Strawberry Hill Stud for $700,000.

Former Magic Millions co-owner John Singleton was spotted with Mr Tinkler and Mr Harvey.  

The coal magnate purchased thoroughbreds from France, Australia, and New Zealand during a financially critical time for the racing industry.

The property achieved only mild success in the racing industry, with many of it's employees working at Patinack for a short time before moving on, despite employing up to 200 people at peak. 

In 2012 there were claims that suppliers had not been reimbursed, resulting in animals going without feed. John Thompson, Patinack's former horse trainer, claimed further that the horses had not received veterinary attention for weeks at a time, The Herald reported. 

The sale of horses will continue until Wednesday, and the Patinack Canungra premises will be auctioned on October 23rd followed by three other property sections in the Hunter Valley and greater Victoria.
