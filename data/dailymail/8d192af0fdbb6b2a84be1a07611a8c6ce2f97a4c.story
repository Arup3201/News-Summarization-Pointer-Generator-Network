Ever wanted to step inside your favourite video games? Now you can thanks to headgear that transforms games into virtual reality.

The Oculus Rift, made by OculusVR, is a headset fitted with a seven-inch screen that is worn while playing certain video games.

A gamer uses the console's controller in the normal way but instead of looking at a TV screen, the images are shown through the visor in stereoscopic 3D - making the gamer feel as if they are playing inside the game.

Developers test the Oculus Rift headset at the 2013 Oculus Developer Conference in Iceland. It works by tracking the player's head movements using sensor technology. It then uses low-latency mitigation, which is a technique used to minimise the delay between the eyes seeing the image and processing what it sees

The Oculus Rift works by tracking the player’s head movements using sensor technology.

It also uses a new technique called low-latency mitigation that lets 
the players explore the world as if it was a reality.

Low-latency mitigation minimises the delay between the eyes seeing an image and processing what it sees.

This makes the images appear to be happening closer to real time.

The Rift's display shows two unique images, one for each eye, that the player’s mind 
fuses into a single stereoscopic 3D view of the virtual world.

At this year’s E3 conference in Los Angeles, players could immerse themselves in the first game made for the Rift – a virtual reality space dog fighting game.  

The prototype model had a 5.6-inch screen but this was increased to 7 inches to improve its quality after testing.

The 7-inch panel's pixel 
switching time is faster and reduces latency and motion blur
 when the wearer turns their head quickly.

The LCD has also been made brighter and it has colour depth of 24 bits per 
pixel.

It has field of view that is more than 90
 degrees pn the horizontal and 110 degrees on the diagonal.

The resolution is 1280x800, which is around 640x800 per eye.

Each eye image is shown in the panel as a pin-cushioned image that is
 then corrected by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped 
image for each eye.

The panel's resolution is expected to be upgraded to
 1920x1080 for the final consumer version.

The weight of the headset is approximately 379g.

The headset has a dial on 
each side that can be turned with a screwdriver which allows adjusting 
each display to be moved closer or further away from the eyes.

David
 Gundry, EVR Programmer, said: ‘In 'traditional', non-VR games, your 
field-of-view is fixed forward or controlled with the mouse or keyboard.

'The Oculus Rift allows you to look around the game as if you 
were actually there.

'This makes the experience much more immersive – you
 are no longer sat at home controlling a computer spaceship, you’re a 
pilot sat in your fighter rocketing around space.

‘We decided to 
make the game as we were all very excited about virtual reality and the 
Oculus Rift, and there was a lot of internal interest about doing 
something with it.

'The decision to create a dogfighting game in this 
setting came from a couple of places; influences from older games such 
as X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter were a big part, but there was also the inner 
twelve-year-old in all of us screaming 'I want to be a space pilot!'.

'Virtual reality is such a perfect fit for this style of cockpit-based 
game.’

With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One on the horizon, EVR is keen to see the Oculus Rift used in next-generation gaming.

There is, 
however, no word on how much it would retail for if released.

Nate 
Mitchell, Vice President of Product Development at Oculus Rift, added: ‘We'd love the 
Oculus Rift to work with next-gen consoles and there are no technical 
hurdles preventing this from happening.

'It's simply a strategic 
partnership decision for the platform holders.

'Right now, we're focused 
on building an incredible, VR platform for the PC, which is a great fit 
for the cutting-edge nature and requirements of high-end, immersive 
virtual reality experiences.’

For gamers who can't wait to experience immersive 3D gaming, the ZEISS cinemizer OLED is an alternative to the Oculus Rift and is available now.

For gamers who can't wait to experience immersive 3D gaming, the ZEISS cinemizer OLED is an alternative to the Oculus Rift and is available now. It costs £599. The device has also been used by architects to walk customers through virtual buildings and by drone-pilots

Like the Oculus Rift, it is a head-mounted display, however, it was designed for more than gaming.

It has been used by drone-pilots as well as architects 
who use them for virtual reality walkthroughs of buildings currently being built. 

It hasn't got the same huge field of vision as the Oculus Rift but the ZEISS cinemizer has a smaller was to make a smaller, sharper image on a lighter head mounted display.

It has an optional headtracker, too, but this feature is not fully supported by console games yet.

This headtracker does work with PC games, though. 

The ZEISS cinemizer OLED costs £599 and the headtracker attachment is an additional £189.
