A promising rugby player died in a freak accident on the golf course when the buggy he was travelling in plunged down an embankment and smashed into a tree.

Jack David Segust, 21, had been in the vehicle with his younger brother Glenn, 19, and a friend, at their local golf course in Herefordshire.

But Jack was left with horrific head injuries after the golf cart careered down a hill.

Emergency crews rushed to Herefordshire Golf Club in Wormsley at around 7pm on Saturday, shortly after the accident and airlifted Jack to hospital.

He tragically passed away from his injuries at QE Hospital in Birmingham shortly afterwards.

His brother and friend were also treated for minor injuries but then discharged.

Jack’s devastated parents Sue, 49, and Phil, paid tribute to their son, who played rugby for Ledbury RFC’s 1st XV team.

They said: 'Jack was home on summer leave from Portsmouth University where he had just completed his second year studying Civil Engineering.

'He was a very active young man and lived for his sport; his passion being rugby. He played for Ledbury RFC.

'In his spare time Jack was a member of the Herefordshire Society of Model Engineers and was building his own steam train at home.

'The life and soul of the party, Jack will be sadly missed by all his friends, family and Barney the Beagle.'

Tributes were also flooding in from dozens of shocked friends on social networking sites, who said the sportsman would never be forgotten.

One touching post on Facebook simply read: 'R.I.P Jack Segust always had a grin from ear to ear, you will be missed x thoughts to your family.'

A spokeswoman for West Mercia police confirmed that the golf course had been open when the tragedy took place.

She added: 'We are investigating with the council at the moment as it is a council-run golf course.'

A spokesman for Herefordshire County Council did not wish to comment on the death.

Today's inquest into Jack’s death was adjourned by the Herefordshire coroner.
