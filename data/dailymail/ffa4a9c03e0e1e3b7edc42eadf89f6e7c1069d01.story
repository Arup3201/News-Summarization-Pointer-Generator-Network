A university student was stabbed to death after argument with religious vigilantes who attacked him for walking with his fiancee.

Three bearded men approached Ahmed Hussein Eid and his partner when they were walking in a park in Suez, Egypt and demanded they go their separate ways because they were not married, security officials said.

An argument broke out which ended with one of the men fatally stabbing the engineering student in his left thigh. He was taken to Ismailia University Hospital but later died of his injuries.

Supporters of Mohamed Morsi celebrate in front of his picture after he was declared president, but now civil rights groups are reporting worrying changes in social structure which they claim has come as a result of Morsi's victory

A group calling themselves 'Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Authority' posted on Facebook that they were responsible for the murder.

The entry read that the young man had been standing with a woman and had been adviced not to do so, Egypt Independent reported.

The post on the page of the organisation, which is a vigilante religious police seeking out those whom they deem to be violating Sharia, said the student insulted them which is why they attacked him with a knife.

The June 25 attack has alarmed Egyptians concerned that with an Islamist president in office, vigilante groups are feeling emboldened to enforce strict Islamic mores on the streets.

The attack happened in a quiet park which is a favorite spot for young couples in Suez, according to security officials.

It has not been specified what enraged the three men, who arrived at the scene on a motorbike, but the initial testimony of the girlfriend said the men told the couple they should not be together because they were not married and must immediately leave and go their separate ways.

An argument followed and one of the three men stabbed 20-year-old Eid in the upper left thigh, near his genitals.

Suez
has a strong Islamist movement and voted heavily in favor of Mohamed 
Morsi in the June 16-17 presidential runoff against Ahmed Shafiq,the 
last prime minister to serve under Mubarak.

The killing took place one day after Morsi was declared the winner.

Suez Islamic groups have denied their involvement in the attack and the leading party Muslim Brotherhood has condemned it.

The spokesperson for the Muslim 
Brotherhood, Mahmud Ghazlan, said: 'We condemn these acts, for they have
nothing to do with Islam and we repudiate them and their perpetrator’

However, secular activists say Islamists are trying to impose their will on communities outside Cairo.

Moderate Muslims along with liberal 
and women's groups now worry that Mohammed Morsi's presidency will 
eradicate what is left of Egypt's secular traditions and change the 
social fabric of the mainly Muslim nation.

Some
activists say Islamists already are flexing their muscles in areas 
outside Cairo and other main cities, taking advantage of the absence of 
civil society groups and lack of security in the areas.

They
cite reports of efforts to persuade drivers of communal minibuses to 
segregate male and female passengers and women's hairdressing salons 
being told to get rid of male employees or  close.

'A lot of minibuses now play Quranic 
recitations on their radios instead of loud popular music as it is 
custom,' said Ali Higris, a student from Maasarah, a working-class 
suburb south of Cairo.

'If Islamists are to try and take over
the streets and enforce their version of Islam, they will do it in 
rural areas, at least initially,' Yara Sallam from Nazra, a women's 
rights group, said.

Civil 
rights groups say they have sent teams to investigate the Suez killing 
and establish whether Islamists were behind the attacks.

On
the same day ad the attack on Eid, two musicians were murdered as they 
were traveling home after performing in a wedding in the Nile Delta 
province of Sharqiyah, officials said.

Radical Muslims consider music "haram" - prohibited - as a distraction from religious duties.

Two
ultraconservative Muslims known as Salafis were arrested, but officials
said it was not clear if the killings were religiously motivated.

There is no government legislation in place which states that women need to cover their hair

Thousands of residents of Abu Kibeer,
the victims' hometown, protested the killings, cutting off roads and 
disrupting train services by sitting on the rails.

They also destroyed the local offices of a charity they suspected the culprits belonged to and torched the home of one suspect.

Some
activists believe that the Brotherhood is at least quietly condoning 
nonviolent activity designed to bring the country more in alignment with
Islam's teachings - a founding goal of the 84-year-old fundamentalist 
movement.

‘They may not be involved but they are
turning a blind eye to what their low and middle rank members do on the
streets,’ said Nehad Abul-Omsan of the Egyptian Center for Women's 
Rights.

‘What they do is 
like test balloons for their leaders. If society stands up to what they 
do, then they know it is not time yet to Islamize.

'If
people accept it, then they ask them to do more. What we need is a 
clear and public commitment to freedoms by the leaders of Islamic 
groups.’

About 100 
activists, political parties and non-governmental groups have issued a 
statement calling on Morsi to protect women against what it said was 
growing incidents of harassment, particularly against those not wearing 
the Muslim veil.

Fully veiled women are also harassing 
women not wearing a veil or wearing colorful ones while traveling on the
women-only train cars of Cairo's busy subway, according to activists 
monitoring women's rights.

Egypt
has for more than 40 years been preoccupied with dealing with the 
threat posed by radicals seeking to create an Islamic state in the 
country.

Mubarak, backed by the U.S., used that threat to maintain tight control over the country.

Morsi,
60, has not mentioned implementing Islam's Shariah law since he 
narrowly won the presidential race but civil rights activists and 
secular groups fear the Brotherhood and its allies are closer than ever 
to realising the dream of an Islamic government in Egypt and are looking
to Morsi to make it happen.
