Rory McIlroy's new potential love interest was lucky to escape serious injury after flipping her car six times in a serious motorway crash.

Nadia Forde has been spotted out with McIlroy in Dublin following his split with world number 15 tennis star Caroline Wozniacki but was lucky to walk away unscathed after a wet weather smash in Warwickshire.

The 25-year-old model lost control of her Fiat 500 in rainy conditions on the M40 before crashing into the motorway's central reservation and flipping the vehicle six times.

Forde was taken to hospital as a precaution in the early hours of Sunday morning due to a blow to the head but was later discharged.

Her spokesman said: 'Her guardian angel was working overtime. It was a real scare and the car was a complete write-off, but she is fine.'

The singer is expected to take time out from promotional work for her new single as she recovers from shock.

McIlroy is busy preparing for The Open, which he begins as third favourite on Thursday.

When asked about the crash he said: 'I saw she was [in car crash]. If anyone's in a car crash you're glad to see they're ok. She's ok and that's good.'
