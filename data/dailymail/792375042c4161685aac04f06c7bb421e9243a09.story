Yaya Toure scored his first goal of this Africa Cup of Nations to help Ivory Coast reach the final for the second time in three years, despite an unconvincing display.

Neither Toure nor his new Manchester City team-mate Wilfried Bony were at their best, against a Democratic Republic of Congo side that few teams expected to get even this far, but Toure’s strike was still the highlight of an entertaining match.

This has not been a great tournament for City’s midfield powerhouse. Sullen both on and off the pitch, rarely able to make an impression from a deeper role than he is used to, and possibly even carrying an injury, Toure had been a shadow of the player we know he can be.

The frustration he showed to pick up a needless yellow card after just half an hour, by haranguing the referee over a throw-in decision, was typical of his tournament so far.

On this occassion he was outshone by the excellent Chancel Mbemba of Anderlecht, and while he was not exactly poor, he was nowhere near the all-action hero he should be for this team.

Unable to influence games as he might like, he has been reduced to merely a forceful personality, vociferously encouraging his team-mates, rather than a forceful performer, leading by example.

But, in the 20th minute, he showed that he can still produce moments of magic. After Bony had been dispossessed in the box, the ball broke to Toure on the edge of the box.

As it bounced across his body, the ball sat up perfectly for the 31-year-old, and he seemed to let out three weeks of tension in the strike, which flew past veteran keeper Robert Kidiaba before he could do more than flap at it.

The shot was not far from the 38-year-old keeper, but it is hard to fault him for failing to save it. Had he been able to react quickly enough to get a hand on it, it would have needed to be made of steel to divert the thunder-strike off target.

The lead lasted just a few seconds. As has been their way all the way through this competition, the Congolese forwards reacted to going behind – although in truth they had a helping hand from both Eric Bailly and referee Neant Alioum.

A hopeful ball into the box drifted over the head of Jeremy Bokila, and struck Bailly on the hand, but quite how he was supposed to have deliberately handled from behind the striker is anyone’s guess. Nonetheless, Alioum pointed to the spot and Dieumercie Mbokani calmly side-footed into the corner.

But, once again, when finding themselves on level terms, DR Congo went back into their shell. Eventually they were punished when Yannick Bolasie gifted the ball to Wilfried Bony deep in his own half, the new City striker feeding Gervinho who finished with aplomb.

It had been coming. Moments earlier Gervinho had a header cleared brilliantly off the line by Peterbrough’s Gabriel Zakuani, who managed to turn the goal-bound effort up onto the underside of the crossbar and away. It was a feat the defender had to repeat in the second half, when Kibiati deflected a Gervinho cross towards his own goal.

Soon after the former Arsenal forward had another chance, running at goal from the right wing before being denied by a brilliant recovery tackle from Jean Kasusula.

The third goal, which killed the game off, came from a corner, Serge Aurier’s header parried into the path of Serge Kanon, who steered it home with a knee.

It was harsh on DR Congo, who had dominated for much of the game.

Despite the quality of the attacking players at his disposal, Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard was once again content to allow the opposition possession for long periods, sitting his two defensive lines deep and utilizing the pace of Gervinho and Gradel on the break.

The Ivorians showed a little more ambition than in their quarter-final, with wing-backs Serge Aurier and Siaka Tiene playing higher up the field than they had for large periods against Algeria, but for the most part they were solid rather than spectacular.

In fact, aside from Gervinho, Aurier was the Ivorians best attacking outlet for much of the game from right wing-back, forcing Bolasie to do rather more tracking back than he is used to.

But the Palace man still managed to find some time to attack, as Congo maintained plenty of possession and, once they had conceded the first goal, began to create some chances.

Bolasie provided first half chances for both Mbokani and Bokila, the former seeing his deflected shot turned away by Sylvain Gbohouo, the latter stopped only by a brilliant challenge from Liverpool’s Kolo Toure.

The winger continued to threaten in the second period, forcing Gbohouo into two good saves early in the second half.

The first came after Bolasie had controlled a cross and smashed it at goal, the second followed a brilliant jinking run, which, had he been able to finish, would have been goal of the tournament.

But with Kannon’s goal the Leopards’ play went from merely attacking to suicidal, as multiple substitutions robbed them of any structure they had possessed in the final third.

More than ever the Ivorians were able to sit deep, and their solidity told, the Leopards scarcely able to muster a shot in the closing stages, while Gervinho should have added a fourth on the break.

They will go into the final, against either Ghana or hosts Equatorial Guinea, as strong favourites. Rather like their captain’s performance, this is not a vintage side, but it might well prove to be enough.

Despite the ‘golden generation’ seemingly being well past their best, they are on the verge of finally winning a major tournament.
