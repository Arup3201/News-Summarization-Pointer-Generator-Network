A man who killed a teenager by shunting his car off the road with his sports car in a revenge attack for eggs being thrown at his brother's restaurant has been jailed for 12 years.

Abid Kwaik, 38, deliberately rammed his Honda NSX into 19-year-old Shenol Ahmet's car because he blamed the victim and his two friends for throwing the eggs, the court heard.

Mr Ahmet suffered massive injuries in the collision and died four days later in hospital.

Front seat passenger Corey Holliday, then 18, received serious head injuries and spent five months in a coma. He now requires round-the-clock treatment.

Rear seat passenger Luke Hall, also 18 at the time, suffered several broken bones in the collision on November 8, 2009.

The court heard that Kwaik was said to have hunted down 
the teenagers in the car after they pelted the Sahara Lounge in 
Stanmore, north-west London, with eggs from the windows of their Fiesta. The incident is believed to have been a random act of vandalism. Kwaik then chased the teenagers for more than a mile.

As the two vehicles reached The Common, Kwaik pulled alongside Mr Ahmet and rammed his car up against its side.

Mr Ahmet lost control of the Fiesta, which spun in the road and careered down a verge into a tree.

Prosecutor
Duncan Penny said: 'Through the way that he furiously drove his vehicle
after them and ultimately into the Fiesta he was effectively using his 
car as a weapon.'

Kwaik was convicted of manslaughter and two counts of unlawful wounding by a jury at Southwark Crown Court.

Passing sentence Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Kwaik: 'By that unlawful act you caused the death of one young man and you caused the most serious injuries to another young man, rendering him into a state where he cannot exist without full time care and where recovering from his severe brain injuries is unlikely.

'You used your vehicle as a weapon, intending that the other vehicle should lose control.
You had a persistent flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and 
complete disregard for the great danger being caused to those three 
young men.â€™

The Judge said that the throwing of eggs went no way towards mitigating the gravity of his offence.

Mr
Hall told the court: 'As the Honda carried on pushing our car started 
sliding to the right. The Honda carried on pushing and then our car 
started going to the other side of the road.

'Our car was facing the trees and his car would have been in line with our back right wheel.

'I do not remember seeing it leave the road, I just remember going close to the tress and then everything went black.'

Giving evidence, Kwaik told the court he had chased after the car because he wanted to get the registration number.

He claimed that the crash happened as he tried to overtake Mr Ahmet because he was frightened of being attacked by the occupants of a car following him.

Kwaik was convicted of manslaughter and two counts of unlawful wounding.

He was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter with five years and three year concurrent sentences for the two counts of unlawful wounding. Judge Pegden also banned Kwaik from driving for ten years.
