Absolutely paranormal: Miss Saunders admits she believes in ghosts

For someone who insists she  does not believe in God and is  not superstitious, it is a rather surprising admission.

But comedian Jennifer Saunders has confessed she believes in ghosts.

The Absolutely Fabulous star, 55, claimed she may even have been haunted by her late grandmother after inadvertently moving into her old address.

She said: ‘It could have all been in my head but when I was younger I thought I saw ghosts quite frequently.

‘Or at least there were strange happenings. I’d wake up and feel a bit funny, open my eyes and could see shapes. It got really scary. When I was at college I was living in a flat in London where there were lots of knockings at the windows and strange noises.

‘For ages I thought it was an annoying bird in the tree outside but there was no tree and absolutely nothing outside my window. Then one day, my mother gave me a photograph of my grandmother in a little lacy dress, being pushed in a swing by her father.

‘The back of the photograph said “15 Steeles Road” which was the address I was living at. And I thought “Ooh, that’s weird”.’

Miss Saunders – who did not appear to be joking – also told Woman and Home magazine: ‘I don’t believe in God and I’m not superstitious, but I do believe in ghosts.’

The comedian, who shot to fame in the 1980s after writing and starring alongside Dawn French in BBC sketch show French and Saunders, spoke of the joy her grandsons have brought her.

Her eldest daughter Ella gave birth to first son Freddie two years ago and second son Bert  in February.

Miss Saunders, whose book Bonkers: My Life in Laughs has been released in paperback, said: ‘I was at both births and it was just heaven.

‘We’re all so pleased because it’s a very female house and now we’ve got these two little boys who are just gorgeous.

'I’m a very hands-on granny. All those things I’ve kind of been grieving for, as my own kids have grown up.

In an interview for the May issue of Woman & Home magazine, the comedian , 55, talks about changing her views on feminism, the lack of women on TV panel shows and how she's started writing the Ab Fab film

'There’s nothing really fascinating about the ducks – or a tractor or the grass – but there is when you’re with a child. It’s just so lovely to do it all again with them.’

Raising three daughters has also transformed her views on feminism. Miss Saunders, who is married to fellow comic Adrian Edmondson, said: ‘My middle daughter Beattie does comedy and it’s a sad fact that boys have a much easier time.

'If you take a girls’ show and a similar boys’ show, the boys will get the job because there’s a prevailing thought that, “Hey, they’re wacky, they’re guys” versus “there’s the girls, trying a bit hard”.

‘It’s the same on the panel shows – it’s a boysy thing. It isn’t awful, because it’s actually funny a lot of the time. But a lot of the time it isn’t – it’s a competition to see how many times they can mention their genitalia – and sometimes you just think “Oh please just stop it!”’

Miss Saunders received worldwide acclaim in the early to mid-1990s for writing and playing the lead role of Edina Monsoon in the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. The show also revived the career of actress Joanna Lumley.

Miss Saunders is now writing the new Absolutely Fabulous film. She said she found the weight of expectation ‘more than for any series, so the fall could be a lot greater if it doesn’t work’.
