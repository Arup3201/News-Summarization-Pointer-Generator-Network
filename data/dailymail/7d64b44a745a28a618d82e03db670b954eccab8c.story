A major hospital was so overrun by patients and queuing ambulances that bosses had to erect a major incident tent normally used to treat casualties after disasters such as air and rail crashes.

Up to 15 ambulances were kept waiting outside the A&E department at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on Easter Monday.

Some stood more than three hours before patients were admitted.

The delays spanned an eight hour period with some stood more than three hours before patients were delivered

The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital was one of the first to be built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative schemes introduced by Labour.

Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) hand financing of large-scale buildings or infrastructure schemes, such as new schools and hospitals, from the Treasury to developers.

The company owns the building and leases it back to the public sector over a period of a minimum of 25 years.

The benefit to the public sector is that there is no up-front burden on the taxpayer and crumbling buildings can be restored or scrapped and completely re-built. The benefit to the private sector is that the repayment interest rates are usually high.

Some companies charge interest rates of up to 70 per cent.

As such, many hospital trusts have struggled with the crippling annual PFI repayments - which run into multi-millions -  at a time when the NHS must make savings of £20bn by 2015. 

In 2006, the public accounts committee revealed that two years after Norwich and Norfolk was completed Barclays, Serco, Innisfree and John 
Laing decided to refinance their joint working company, Octagon, so that
they could take early profits.

By increasing the size of the borrowings - from £200m to more than £300m
- and the time taken to repay that money from the year 2017 to 2037, 
they managed to take out a windfall of £115m. It was reported they gave only £34m of that to the hospital trust and kept the rest for themselves.

The situation got so bad that a major
incident tent similar to a field hospital was put up so paramedics 
could drop off their patients.

Frustrated ambulance staff said the 
emergency tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes and 
putting it outside the hospital was 'unheard of'.

But hospital bosses said it was only 
erected 'as a precaution' for 1 hour and 45 minutes and in the end 
no-one had to be treated in it.

The hospital faced a similar problem last month when all 17 ambulances were left queuing outside A&E.

On that occasion the East of England 
Ambulance Service was left unable to attend 12 other 999 calls and 
ambulances had to be drafted in from further afield.

The latest incident came after the 
hospital's director of medicine and emergency care, Chris Cobb, said 
they should be able to cope with 15 ambulances turning up at once.

One ambulance crewman said: 'We are 
so fed-up with getting slated and being made to look as if the ambulance
service is to blame for the delays - but it's not us, it's A&E.

'They want to get out and save lives. That's all they want to do and they are getting caught up in a political row.

'The tent is usually used at plane 
crashes and big events, such as the Lord Mayor's parade. To put it up 
outside the A&E is unheard of.'

Another ambulance worker, who also asked to remain anonymous, said: 'It's a mini-hospital in a tent.'

'It will usually have in it treatment 
bays, drugs, oxygen, the same stuff on board an ambulance but inside a 
tent - which is a lot colder.'

Ambulance service spokesman Oskan 
Edwarson said: 'Between 11am and 8pm the trust had an average of between
six and 15 vehicles queuing for up to three plus hours.

'Clearly this led to ambulances not being available to respond to other patients in the community.

'We worked closely with the hospital 
and clinical commissioning group throughout the afternoon and deployed 
the the trust major incident tent to help release ambulances back on to 
the road.

'The trust is pleased that this issue
is now resolved following much hard work by the hospital and the 
ambulance service and that in the end no patients were required to be 
treated in the major incident tent at this time.'

Hospital chief executive Anna Dugdale said: 'We were extremely busy over the weekend.

'We made a decision with the ambulance trust to put the tent up simply as a precaution at about half-past six last night.

'We agreed by quarter-past eight that we didn't need it.

'The demand on emergency services 
over the bank holiday weekend had been exceptionally high and the 
ambulance tent was erected for a short period as a precautionary 
measure.'

Now a local MP has demanded answers 
from the hospital and called for an investigation to ensure patients at 
the hospital receive the appropriate care.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter, MP 
for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said: 'This is clearly some 
unacceptable poor standard of care for 999 patients in Norfolk and 
Suffolk.

'Front line paramedics are doing 
their best to get their patients into the care of the Norfolk & 
Norwich and it seems the hospital system of triage is not up to 
standard.

'It is time the hospital management learned lessons and improve triage process.

'Clearly there are very busy days but the N&N has a poor history on ambulances not being able to deliver 999 patients.'
