Despite having reputations for wild parties, excessive drinking and allegedly hazing junior members, new research shows that members of Greek organizations on college campuses are more likely to graduate on time than their non-Greek counterparts.Â 

Additionally, the study found, membership in a sorority has no effect on a woman's GPA. However, the same can not be said for men in fraternities - according to the study, published in the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, finds that fraternity men have lower GPAs than those not in Greek life.

The GPAs for men in fraternities, the study's authors - P. Wesley Routon of Middle Tennessee State University and Jay Walker of Niagara University - conclude, is 'only very slightly' lower than their non-Greek, male counterparts.

'Seven years of college down the drain!' Not quite - study finds Greek students are more likely to graduate in four years

'Greek membership is found to increase the desire to pursue a graduate 
degree, and increase the likelihood of graduating on time,' the authors write in the report.

They add that 'four-year graduation rates are notably higher for Greek members, with male and female members being 4.8 and 4.7 percentage points more likely to do so, respectively (compared to non-members).'

The study is based on a survey of more than 103,000 students at 463 colleges and universities across the U.S. Of the respondents, 19 percent reported that they were a member of a fraternity or sorority.

The surveys were given to students in both their freshman and senior years. The researchers used the method that 'Greek members are only compared to very similar students who did not join a Greek organization.'

Requirements: Members of Greek organizations have academic requirements, which may be why they are more likely to graduate on time

The study was first reported by Pacific Standard Magazine.

The study also found that common stereotypes that students who are members of Greek organizations party like in the beer-guzzling buffoons in the classic film Animal House have some merit.

'Membership in a Greek organization is found to increase the
 frequency of smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, drinking wine or 
liquor, and hours per week partying during the senior year,' they write.

The study finds that while there are only small increases in a student's likelihood to smoke cigarettes as members of a Greek organization, their likelihood to to drink more frequently than non-members increases significantly.

More drinking, however, had little bearing on how students performed academically - which may be the result of academic requirements Greek organizations place on their members.

Drink up: members of Greek organizations are morel likely to drink more frequently than non-Greek students

'The increased likelihoods of graduating on time may stem from Greek 
members having an added incentive to stay enrolled and keep a minimum 
GPA, so that they can continue to belong to the organization,' the study finds.

Additionally, members of both sororities and fraternities are more likely to be involved in student government than other students, and participate in volunteer activities more often than non-Greek students.
