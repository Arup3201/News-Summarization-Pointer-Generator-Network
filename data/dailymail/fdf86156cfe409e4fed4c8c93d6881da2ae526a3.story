Britain poured more than £1 billion of aid into countries run by the world’s most corrupt regimes in 2013 – despite warnings that much of it will go to waste.

A study by the respected anti-corruption organisation Transparency International reveals that all but one of the 20 most corrupt countries receive aid from Britain.

And figures reveal that British aid to these worst offenders rose by almost a quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 as ministers and officials raced to distribute cash in time to hit the Government’s controversial aid target.

Beneficiaries include war-torn countries such as Somalia and Sudan, where terror groups are reported to ‘tax’ aid payments, and even North Korea, where the erratic Kim Jong-un rules with an iron fist.

The revelations will raise fresh concerns about David Cameron’s drive to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid.

Tory MP Philip Davies described the spending as a ‘colossal waste of money’ and warned that voters would not understand why their money was being spent to prop up corrupt regimes.

‘It is completely unacceptable,’ he said. ‘We should not be giving money to countries who have not got their houses in order. 

'This is exactly why you hear people saying that foreign aid is taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries – you might as well stick a Mercedes catalogue in the envelope.’

Andy Silvester, campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Every penny of foreign aid has to be spent on those who really need it, not to line the pockets of corrupt officials in questionable regimes. It’s simply mind-boggling that we’re dishing out aid to countries like North Korea when our own finances are in such a terrible state.’

The Department for International Development last night insisted it took a zero-tolerance approach to corruption.

Sources said aid programmes in countries with known corruption problems channelled money through aid agencies and charities rather than governments.

A department spokesman said: ‘It is precisely because the UK does not tolerate corruption that we do not allocate funds to the governments of any of the 20 countries highlighted by Transparency International as being the world’s most corrupt.

‘Instead we use multilateral organisations like the United Nations and trusted international non-governmental organisations to assist the very poorest.’

But critics warn that much of the cash still ends up in the hands of corrupt local officials. And they point out that the aid money funds projects that should be supported by the countries themselves.

Mr Davies said: ‘Even where the money is not going directly to dictators, it is still using British taxpayers’ money to cover for the fact that they are spending the country’s money on themselves – we are propping them up.

‘It is a colossal waste of money, which is being done to make lots of middle class worthy people feel better about themselves.’

The UN aid target, which has been embraced by Mr Cameron, has been ignored by most of the world’s major economies. 

It required a 30 per cent increase in the UK aid budget in 2013 to £11.5 billion, piling huge pressure on ministers and officials to get the money out of the door.

Aid to Somalia, ranked by Transparency International as the world’s most corrupt country, was increased by 19.5 per cent in 2013 to £107.3 million.

Although the money is channelled through charities and agencies rather than the central government to sidestep corruption, several independent reports have found that many of these groups are forced to hand over large sums of cash to the terror group Al-Shabaab in return for protection.

The respected Overseas Development Institute said the group had even set up an office responsible for taxing aid agencies operating in its territory.

Other countries showered with cash include Yemen, home of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular, which received a 143 per cent increase, and Libya, where the government has all but collapsed. 

North Korea, viewed as a pariah state by most of the world, was handed £1.3million. 

Most of the cash is thought to have been provided by the Foreign Office as part of its efforts at so-called ‘soft diplomacy’.

Last month it emerged the aid included funding the training of 46 spin doctors employed by the state-controlled media as propagandists.

Aid to Afghanistan was cut, but Britain still sent more than £200million to the country, which is rated as the world’s fourth most corrupt regime.
