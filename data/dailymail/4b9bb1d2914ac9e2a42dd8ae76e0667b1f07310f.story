A professional football player trapped in the Qatar for two years over a pay dispute with his club was today finally been granted an exit visa.

Zahir Belounis has not been able to leave the Gulf state - which was controversially awarded the 2022 World Cup - and return home to France during the protracted legal wrangling with team El Jaish.

The 33-year-old had insisted he was owed unpaid salary dating back to 2010 but while the claims went through the Qatari legal system, Mr Belounis was prevented from leaving the country.

This is the latest controversy to hit 
the Gulf state, which has been accused of exploiting foreign workers, 
turning many into modern-day slaves.

An
 investigation earlier this year found seventy Nepalese builders had 
died on construction of World Cup 2022 sites since the start of 2012.

'I feel like a hostage,' Belounis told CNN.

'Life
 has become a nightmare for me, my wife and my two small daughters. I 
try to be the best daddy I can but after I tuck them in at night, I go 
to bed and cry like a baby.

'They killed me inside. I hated myself. I had very dark thoughts.'

The kafala system mean that all expatriate workers in Qatar and some visitors require someone to sponsor their entry and exit from the country.

In some cases when a dispute arises between an worker and employer, the exit visa can be difficult to get hold of.

It took the intervention of the French government and relentless international pressure on the Qatari Football Association before Belounis was allowed to return home.

The ordeal has brought the married father-of-two close to suicide, he claims.

The Qatari Football Association has disputed Belounis version of events.

It claims he had not taken his case up with the judicial bodies of FIFA and that following its investigation into the allegations, Mr Belounis received all the money he was owed.

El Jaish declined comment.Â 

Nick McGeehan, a Human Rights Watch lawyer, who has worked with Belounis throughout his case, said there was very little support for non-nationals who were in a contractual dispute.

He called on the Qatari government to abandon the exit visa system which can create a situation where foreign workers are trapped in the country.

He told CNN: 'It is our understanding that migrant workers often encounter serious difficulties getting exit visas from their employer for a variety of reasons.

'Migrant worker abuses are typically associated with low-paid workers from south Asia.'

This case is the latest in a series of negative news stories about the treatment of some foreign workers in Qatar.

The Guardian newspaper produced a report 
and video alleging that Nepalese workers in Qatar 'face exploitation and
 abuses that amount to modern-day slavery'.

The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee said while construction directly related to the World Cup had yet to start it was committed to providing proper treatment for workers.
