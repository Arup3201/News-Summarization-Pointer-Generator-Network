The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Arizona boyfriend killer Jodi Arias by voting not to give her the death penalty is speaking out in her own defense.

The 33-year-old known anonymously as Juror 17 says she's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by 'brutal' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury.

In a multi-part interview with KPNX in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance, the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some 'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life.

Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement.

'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.'

Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little.

'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX. 'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.'

When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would.

However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose.

Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail.

Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection.

'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.'

Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. 

'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom.

Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago

Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network.

The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago.

'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying.

The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing.

'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement.

Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed.

Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated.

A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. 

Lifetime movie: Juror 17 admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) in 'bits and pieces' while being screened for her service. Her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury

A mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. 

Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial.

Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie.

The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential.

And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network.
