Quarter-final: Holland vs Costa Rica

Venue: Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador

Kick-off: 9pm (5pm, Brazil time)

Odds: Holland 8/15, Draw 3/1, Costa Rica 6/1

Referee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)

Managers: 

Louis van Gaal (Holland)Jorge Luis Pinto (Costa Rica)

The gaffer: Holland's squad listen intently as manager Louis van Gaal holds court

Key clash: Robin van Persie (Holland) v Michael Umana (Costa Rica)

Costa Rica have been sound at the back so far: led by their experienced centre back Umana they have stopped Edinson Cavani, Mario Balotelli and Wayne Rooney. Van Persie is in fine form at this World Cup though and Umana will be stuck in a physical battle to stop him scoring his first goal in the knockout rounds.

One to watch: Arjen Robben (Holland)

The Flying Dutchman has been instrumental for Louis van Gaal’s side on their way to this point. He terrorised the reigning champions Spain in Holland’s opener and has continued in a similar vein since.

Head-to-head record: Played 0

Boot room bet: Ruiz to score first — 11/1

Back to the day job: Costa Rica attacking midfielder Bryan Ruiz went in goal in training on Friday
