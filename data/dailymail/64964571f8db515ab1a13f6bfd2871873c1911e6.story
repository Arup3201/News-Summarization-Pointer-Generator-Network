If all you want for Christmas is the body of a Victoria’s Secret lingerie model, this could be just the ticket.

Michael Olajide Jr, the former boxing champion who trains VS Angels Karlie Kloss, Adriana Lima and Kate Upton, has put the exercises he sets for them into a series of online fitness videos.

His routines claim to contain moves that target several muscle groups at once and are based around boxing techniques, with names such as The Pyramid Stance, Pyramid Power Punch, Aero Jumps, Aero Squats, and Shuffle Squats.

Heavenly bodies: Michael Olajide Jr's exercises are popular among the Victoria's Secret Angels, seen here at this year's show in London are Lily Aldridge, Candice Swanepoel, Doutzen Kroes and Alessandra Ambrosio,

Each video can be downloaded for about £3 from the website aerospacehpc.com.

Kloss and the other Angels were flown in to London by private jet last week for the Victoria’s Secret Christmas fashion show.

Now it's Tetris therapy 

Game on: Tetris could stop flashbacks

Road accident victims could be offered an unusual therapy when they arrive at hospital: the computer game Tetris. 

As part of their treatment at the Emergency Department of John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, they will be asked to play the tile-matching puzzle within six hours of the accident.

Researchers believe that the visual-spatial demands of the game will disrupt and prevent the forming of the mental imagery related to the accident in the long-term memory. 

This can lead to flashbacks associated with post traumatic stress disorder.

The trial follows research at Oxford University where some volunteers watched a disturbing film and were then asked to play Tetris or take part in some other activity.

The Tetris group had fewer flashbacks of the film than the others.

Cafes and restaurants will have to provide clear information about allergenic ingredients in their food and drink from next week. 

The law on labelling used to only apply to pre-packaged food, but now catering establishments must list all major allergens (including peanuts, eggs, milk and molluscs) on the menu or via a member of staff who can inform customers verbally.

The Anaphylaxis Campaign, launched 20 years ago after the death of a teenage girl who ate a lemon meringue pie sprinkled with crushed peanuts in a cafe, has welcomed the new EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation.

Cancer ad saves lives

Hundreds of lives have been saved thanks to an NHS drive to diagnose more cases of lung cancer. Some 3,000 extra referrals were made by GPs after an advertising campaign, Be Clear On Cancer, first ran from May to July 2012.

 It led to about 700 extra patients being diagnosed with the disease – 400 of them spotted at an early enough stage when treatment is more effective, and 300 who benefited from lifesaving surgery. 

The posters feature the message: ‘Been coughing for three weeks? Tell your doctor.’ The figures were published in the British Cancer Journal last week.  

Always wanted a bigger brain? Try meditating. Neuroscientists at Harvard discovered that the grey matter density of the hippocampus, the area of the brain connected to memory, learning, compassion, self-awareness and introspection, increased among those who meditated for just 27 minutes a day. 

They took part in an eight-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Program (MBSR) with magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain taken before and after the programme.

The meditation was done with the help of audio recordings.
