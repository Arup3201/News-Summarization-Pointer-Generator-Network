Moussa Sissoko has reiterated his desire to play for 'a very big club' as speculation continues to mount over the future of the Newcastle midfielder.

Paris St Germain have reportedly expressed an interest in the France international but Sissoko says he would prefer a future in the Premier League.

The news is sure to interest Arsenal, whom Sissoko described as 'the club of my heart' earlier this month, while Chelsea are also said to have shown an interest.

The French international is reportedly attracting interest from Paris St Germain

Sissoko said in an interview with the French website Foot Mercato: 'My goal was to come to England because it was the championship that best matched my game and I do not think I am wrong.

'So I want to stay here and grow at one of the biggest clubs in England. I have a preference for the Premier League and I see myself staying here.

'I am focused on Newcastle. I have a four-and-a-half year contract so in my head I still tell myself I am still here for four years and a half. They appreciate me here and everything is good.'

Sissoko has refused to rule out the possibility of a return to France's Ligue 1 

The 25-year-old has impressed in his two years in the Premier League since arriving from Toulouse, and a move to Paris would boost his stated desire to play in the Champions League.

And while Sissoko said he had not had any contact from the French giants, he refused to rule out the possibility of a return to Ligue 1.

Sissoko added: 'I am not saying that I absolutely want to go or not. If it happens, it happens. I am at Newcastle and I will continue to work until one day I have the chance to play at a very big club.

Sissoko has featured 24 times for the Magpies so far this season

'Nobody has called me. My agent and I have not spoken to anyone.

'PSG is one of the best clubs in Europe. If I'm lucky they are interested with me. These are difficult things to refuse. I cannot say yes or no but it is an interest I would take into consideration.'

Meanwhile Newcastle defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has completed his permanent move to Roma after being on loan with the Serie A side since September last year.
