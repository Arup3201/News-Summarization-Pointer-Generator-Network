David Cameron is being urged to undergo anti-sexism training to help boost the number of women in Government.

Tory MP Therese Coffey revealed she is encouraging the Prime Minister to undergo so-called ‘unconscious bias’ training in a bid to help make both the Government and the Conservative Party more diverse.

Mr Cameron has been accused of displaying schoolboy sexism towards female MPs in the Commons – once telling shadow Treasury chief secretary Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’, and, on another occasion, joking that maverick Tory Nadine Dorries was ‘extremely frustrated’.

David Cameron was criticised after telling Labour MP Angela Eagle to 'calm down dear' during Prime Minister's Questions in April 2011

He has also made little progress towards meeting his pledge of ensuring that one-third of his ministers are women by the end of the Parliament.

Unconscious bias training is increasingly used by major corporations to help executives overcome the innate prejudices that mean they often overlook promising women and candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds.

Miss Coffey, Parliamentary aide to the Business Minister Michael Fallon, said the issue had been discussed by the Conservative Women’s Forum as a way of helping talented women get on in the party.

She said she would be presenting Mr Cameron with a report on unconscious bias later this month and urging him to introduce training to tackle it throughout the Conservative Party.

Miss Coffey said it could help tackle complaints that middle class white men are more likely to get a safe seat, and more likely to get a job in Government.

‘I think it would be useful for the Conservative Party to select our candidates,’ she said.

‘I think the Prime Minister would be open to it. He went out of his way in our candidate selection process to put into place certain things.

‘From my perspective that would be about finding the best process to make sure that people of all talents get to the top.

‘A lot of people dismiss unconscious bias training as mumbo jumbo but more and more companies in the FTSE 100 are starting to use it.

‘It’s designed to tackle the innate prejudices in all of us that mean people often recruit people like themselves and help explain why here are many more white men at the top of our companies.’

Asked whether Mr Cameron should undergo the training himself, Miss Coffey replied: ‘I don’t see why not.’

Recent polls suggest David Cameron has lost his appeal to women voters following a series of measures perceived as anti-women.

He has presided over a highly controversial cut to child benefit for better-off families, the impact of which will be felt directly by women.

Flagship plans to reform childcare provision and funding have become mired in Whitehall infighting.

Unconscious bias training has become commonplace in the corporate world and is spreading to this country.

Accountancy giant PwC recently made the training compulsory for all staff as part of a drive to improve diversity at the top.

Executives are taught to try to analyse their innate prejudices and set them aside.
