These incredible new images of Mars, taken on 6 June by the high-resolution stereo camera on ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft, show the stunning beauty of the Martian landscape - and reveal the telltale signs that water was once commonplace on the red planet, and could still be there in huge underground glaciers.

They show the rugged terrain of Nereidum Montes, an area that marks the far northern extent of Argyre, one of the largest impact basins on Mars.

Nereidum Montes stretches almost 1150 km and was named by the noted Greek astronomer Eugène Michel Antoniadi (1870–1944).

This computer-generated perspective view was created using data obtained from the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on ESA¿s Mars Express, and shows rippled sand dunes which form on the leeward (wind-sheltered) sides of mounds and canyons

Based on his extensive observations of Mars, Antoniadi famously concluded that the ‘canals’ on Mars reported by Percival Lowell were, in fact, just an optical illusion. 

The new images captured by Mars Express show a portion of the region, displaying multiple fluvial, glacial and wind-driven features.

Extensive drainage patterns can be seen towards the north (lower right side) of the first images, were formed when liquid water drained into deeper regions within the area.

'On Earth, tree-like channels of this kind are usually formed by surface runoff after significant rainfall, or when snow or ice melts,' ESA said in a statement.

'Similar processes are thought to have occurred on Mars in the distant past, when scientists now know there to have been water on the surface of the Red Planet.'

Several of the craters within the region, particularly in eastern parts (lower section) of the first image, show concentric crater fill, a distinctive martian process marked by rings of surface fluctuations within a crater rim, the researchers say.

The ratios between the diameter and depth of the filled craters suggest that there may still be water ice, possibly in the form of ancient glaciers, present below the dry surface debris cover.

Scientists have estimated that the water-ice depth in these craters varies from several tens up to hundreds of metres.

Concentric crater fill can be seen in many of the craters towards the east (lower part of the image). Undulations in crater floors are commonly seen in mid-latitude regions on Mars and are believed to be a result of glacial movement.

In the image above, a smooth area to the east of (below) the glacial feature appears to be the youngest within the image, evidenced by an almost complete lack of cratering.

Another indication of subsurface water is seen in the fluidised ejecta blanket surrounding the crater at the northern edge (right-hand side).

These ejecta structures can develop when a comet or asteroid hits a surface saturated with water or water ice, ESA scientists say. 

The researchers say the images could also help plan where humans could eventually visit.

'In-depth studies of regions such as 
Nereidum Montes play an essential role in unlocking the geological past 
of our terrestrial neighbour, as well as helping to find exciting 
regions for future robotic and human explorers to visit.'

Taken on 6 June 2012, the colour coding enhances the visibility of the rippling sand dunes which formed in the wind-sheltered sides of the mounds and canyons.

Centred at around 40°S and 310°E, the image has a ground resolution of about 23 m per pixel. In the foreground near to the crater, a mud or ice-landslide is seen, possibly due to glacial processes
