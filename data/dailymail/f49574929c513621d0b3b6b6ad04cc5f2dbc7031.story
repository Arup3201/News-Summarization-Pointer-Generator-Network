Pilots for budget airline Ryanair have expressed serious concerns about passenger safety – and claim that these are suppressed by bosses.

In an internal survey of 1,000 pilots, two-thirds said they did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through the airline’s internal system, while nine out of ten said it did not have an ‘open and transparent safety culture’.

It comes just months after three Ryanair planes were forced to make emergency landings in Spain on the same day, when they allegedly started to run out of fuel.

Taking flight: Three-quarters of Ryanair pilots are reported to be on zero-hours contracts and must pay for all their expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation

The survey was leaked to Channel 4 for a Dispatches documentary, in which an anonymous pilot claimed employees were scared to speak out to bosses about safety fears.

The pilot added: ‘It is really difficult to talk to them and the tone used is really unusual for an airline. It’s usually threats and bullying.’

Three-quarters of Ryanair pilots are reported to be on zero-hours contracts and must pay for all their expenses, including uniforms, identity cards, transport and hotel accommodation.

Pilots claim the contracts make them more likely to fly even when they feel unwell, because they do not get sick pay.

In the documentary, Ryanair: Secrets From The Cockpit, to be broadcast tonight, one said: ‘About 70 per cent of our pilots, if not more, are on a [zero-hours] contract. They get paid only if they fly. So that’s the pressure.’

In April this year, several hundred pilots signed a petition calling on Irish and European regulators to examine the impact of Ryanair’s employment contracts on safety. 

It said the ‘confusing, uncertain and unpredictable employment situation’ was causing ‘stress and worry’ for pilots and was becoming ‘an increasing distraction in daily flight operations’.

It was met with a stern warning to staff from the airline’s chief pilot Ray Conway, that ‘any Ryanair pilot who participates in this so-called safety petition will be guilty of gross misconduct and will be liable for dismissal’.

Ryanair, which has repeatedly come under fire over its hidden charges for passengers for everything from booking online to checking in bags, is the largest low-cost carrier in Europe and flies to 145 destinations, including 15 in the UK.

Last month, it emerged pilots were ordered to fly more slowly in a bid to save money on fuel after a fall in the airline’s quarterly profit.

The latest survey was commissioned by The Ryanair Pilot Group, which represents more than half of the airline’s 2,500 pilots but is not recognised by the company.

It found more than half of pilots said the threat to their jobs had made them ‘more reluctant’ to speak out about safety concerns.

Two-thirds did not ‘have confidence’ in the safety reporting system, while  94 per cent said Mr Conway’s memo was an attempt to ‘suppress pilots raising concerns’.

The vast majority of pilots also claimed bosses failed to provide them with information on previous ‘incidents’ involving Ryanair aircraft. 

Last year, Ryanair was accused of 
operating with a level of fuel that was ‘close to the minimum’ required 
in the case of a diversion.

Three of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft heading to Madrid were forced to make emergency landings after being diverted to Valencia because of thunderstorms.

Spanish pilot union leaders accused the 
airline of ‘courting disaster’ to cut costs and Ryanair was ordered to 
review its fuel policy.

'Airline safety is a matter of fact and evidence. It is not something that can be traduced to a subjective survey'

Ryanair spokesman

The airline insisted: ‘All Ryanair flights depart with planned fuel that exceeds EU guidelines. No Ryanair flight operates with minimum fuel.’

Of the latest survey, Ryanair told Dispatches it rejected false claims made by a tiny number of pilots as a way of promoting ‘failed efforts to unionise Ryanair pilots’.

A spokesman said: ‘Airline safety is a matter of fact and evidence. It is not something that can be traduced to a subjective survey.’

They added that Ryanair’s operations were fully compliant with EU requirements and pilots should raise concerns through the airline’s confidential safety reporting system..
