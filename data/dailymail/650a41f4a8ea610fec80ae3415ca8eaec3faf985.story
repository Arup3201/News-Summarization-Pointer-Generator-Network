Lord Lloyd-Webber’s musical about Stephen Ward, the fixer at the centre of the Profumo affair, is ‘on a knife edge’ and expected to close after a run of just six months in London’s West End.

The Oscar-winning composer of Evita and Cats has told friends that the future of the production, which revisits Britain’s most infamous sex scandal, is ‘touch and go’.

Stephen Ward The Musical opened at the Aldwych Theatre in December, receiving generally good reviews.

The combination of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s name and the public’s continuing interest in the 1963 affair – which led to the downfall of John Profumo, the Conservative Secretary of State  for War – seemed certain to produce another box-office hit.

But sources close to the production, which has a book and lyrics by Oscar winners Don Black and Christopher Hampton, confirm that ticket sales have been sluggish and that the show is unlikely to survive its initial booking period, which runs out at the end of May.

Audiences have been surprised by big discounts on tickets and how many have been available. Last month, seats normally selling for £67.50 were cut to £39.50.

If the show closes in May, this will be the shortest-lived of Lloyd Webber’s career. In comparison, The Phantom Of The Opera opened in 1986 and is still running.

One insider said: ‘Andrew has told friends that the show is touch and go at the moment. Things are on a knife edge and sales have not lived up to expectations.

‘It’s a shame if it doesn’t find an audience because the fact is all the three writers are very proud of it.’

The show focuses on the trial of Ward, an osteopath, who was accused of living off immoral earnings.

Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies were to be the main witnesses.

The writers are convinced Ward was a scapegoat and innocent of the charges. He killed himself before the verdict.

Lloyd Webber is supporting an attempt by Geoffrey Robertson QC to have Ward’s conviction quashed.

Last night a spokesman for the Criminal Cases Review Commission said it had studied Robertson’s arguments and decided they were worthy of further investigation.
