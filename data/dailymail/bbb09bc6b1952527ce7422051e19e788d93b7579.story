One of the three British jihadists who joined terror group Isis in Syria has used ask.fm to urge others to join the fight.

In a series of new online postings, 17-year-old militant Aseel Muthana, from Cardiff, south Wales, told a would-be jihadist how he felt 'so excited' before leaving for the Middle East.

He also told another fanatic on the social network answer-and-question site to pray 'every night' in order to realise a dream of joining him in Syria.

Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria   

Aseel made worldwide headlines last month when it emerged how he, brother Nasser, 20, and friend Reyaad Khan, 20, had joined the Islamist extremist group.

In an interview with the BBC last week said 'Jihad is obligatory' and how he was willing to die for Isis, which has taken over large swathes of Syria and Iraq. 

In his latest postings on ask.fm, Aseel was told by a would-be Isis fighter: 'I love the khalifa (Islamic state) even more from my heart, I wish I was there so badly.'

The teenager replied: 'I remember a couple months before I left I had those feelings. I was so excited, I didn't even want to wait. I used to wish I was there.'

When the questioner asks whether they need to go through tazkiyah (a spiritual transformation) before joining him, Aseel replies: 'We can sort something out'. 

Details of his latest online posts came as the UK Treasury announced it had frozen the bank accounts of the two older men, who have both appeared in an Isis recruitment video.

Violent: Brother Nasser Muthana also tweeted a picture of a weapon that he hoped would help decapitate an enemy

They both feature on a list, published on Friday evening, of 25 individuals and 27 organisations facing sanctions.

Isis has demanded officials and soldiers pledge allegiance to the Islamic state they recently declared or face execution. 

More than one million Iraqis have fled their homes after Isis seized Mosul, Tikrit and other cities in the north-west. 

At least 2,461 people were killed in June, the UN and Iraqi officials say.

The Muthana brothers and Khan appear to be using social media to talk about brutal executions and life on the frontline.

Aseel has defended the brutality of Isis killings in Syria by saying he stood by Sharia law and was glad to be out there.

In one account Nasser mocked the publicity which followed the release of the Isis video in which he called for others to join the fight in Syria.

He gave a graphic account of a battle and referred to beheadings. In one comment he said: 'Two tanks were taken... and we brought back heads with us.'

And on a Twitter account, which has since been suspended, Nasser sent his friends a chilling picture showing an apparent stash of home-made bombs - and warned that the British Government should be 'afraid' about him returning with his new skills.

He also posted a chilling photograph which appears to show a home-made weapon believed to be taken from an enemy Shia Muslim - and his plan to behead the captive fighter.

The brothers' devastated father Ahmed Muthana has appealed for them to come home.

He said: ‘This is not the son I know. Maybe if they have a heart they’ll come back.

‘What they are doing or posting online, they are being told to by the people with the guns who feed them, look after them and have control over them. They are trapped in the situation and that makes it hard for them to come back or leave the place.'

Meanwhile, Khan yesterday posted what he claimed were the latest details of factional in-fighting between Isis and al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra.

He wrote: 'Caught a convoy of JN murtadeen, over 100 prisoners, heavy weapons, cars etc and an ex-JN shari'i just spoke back 2 JN telling them 2 make tawbah [repentance].'
