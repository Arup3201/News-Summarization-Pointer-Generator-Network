Facebook, the world's largest Internet social network acted yesterday to boost its games content.

The move came on the same day that Google Inc introduced games on its recently-launched social network Google+.

Google launched its social networking site in June, signing up more than 10 million users in the first two weeks.

The company said it would offer 16 games 
from third party developers on Google+, including Zynga Poker, Bejeweled and the infectiously 
popular Angry Birds game.

The game has become a blockbuster, with users downloading it 250million times to launch furious birds at egg-stealing green pigs.

Dveloped by Rovio, there are rumours that companies want to invest in the game which would make it worth an estimated £1.2billion.

Its flock of fans spend a combined 200million minutes throwing angry birds at pinching pigs and the game has sold more than three million toys, according to The Times.

Google, which has a stake of undisclosed size in Zynga, said it will roll out games gradually 
on Google+, and make the game feature available to everyone 'soon.'

Games on Google+ have their own separate page, which may help convert Facebook users bored with reading their friends’ game notifications.

Vic Gundotra, Google Senior Vice President, Engineering said: 'That means giving you control over when you see games, how you play them and with whom you share your experiences.

'Games in Google+ are there when you want them and gone when you don’t.'

'You can see the latest game updates from your circles, browse the invites you've received and check out games that people you know have played recently.

'Your circles will only see the updates when they’re interested in playing games too.' 

And Google+ users who have no interest in playing online games can just ignore the games tab.

Now Facebook is keen to harness the popularity of games on its service.

Facebook, which was hosting 100 game 
developers for an event at its California headquarters in Palo Alto, announced some new features to improve the 
gaming experience on its website, as well as a policy loosening 
restrictions on how developers can market their games.

The changes will expand the types of 
notifications that Facebook users see when their friends are playing 
games on the website, rolling back restrictions made last year that 
provoked grumbles among some game developers.

Facebook head of games Sean Ryan said: 'Our
games ecosystem has continued to grow. But there's no question that we 
want to grow it faster in a more high quality way for our users and 
developers.'

Games such as Zynga's Farmville are some of the most popular activities on Facebook.

More than 200million users play 
games on Facebook every month, and the company takes a 30 per cent cut of
the sale of virtual goods bought by users during gaming.

With the two Web giants competing to attract users to their respective online services, the dueling social gaming announcements underscored what could emerge as a key battleground between the two companies.

Jeremy Liew, a partner at venture 
capital firm Lightspeed, which has invested in social game companies 
said of Google's announcement: 'It turns out that people like to play games, and it's core to the social networking use case.'

Liew added that Google's move to offer games on its social network provides game developers with a compelling alternative to Facebook.

But he said the most important consideration for game makers is which social network has the most users.

'Right now no one is going to be willing to give up Facebook because it's where the users are Today. Google+ got a terrific start but it's got a ways to go.'

Among the new gaming features introduced by Facebook on Thursday are the ability to expand the size of the window in which games are played on Facebook's site, new ways for users to create bookmarks for their favorite games and a scrolling 'ticker' that highlights the games a person's friends are playing, their recent scores and achievements.

In loosening restrictions on game updates within Facebook's general newsfeed, the company must walk a fine line between helping developers promote their games on the network and irking users that are not avid gamers.

Facebook's newsfeed - which displays a rolling stream of messages, photos and updates from friends - is a vital distribution channel for gamemakers, allowing companies like Zynga, Electronic Arts' Playfish and Playdom to reach vast numbers of users.

But it has caused some backlash among Facebook's non-gaming users, who found the constant notifications about their friends' progress within various games to be irrelevant and annoying.

Last year, Facebook clamped down on the practice, so that Facebook users would receive notifications only about games which they had also installed.

Under the new policy, Facebook users will see notifications about any game their friends are playing.

But Ryan said the company had developed special algorithms that will only display updates if Facebook has a reason to believe they are relevant to the person.

If the person shows no interest in certain types of games, Facebook won't serve them updates in the newsfeed.

'No one wants to go back to the bad old days of people being very unhappy about gaming because they feel like they're being spammed all the time,' said Ryan.

'That's the key which we really spent months and months working on, is that tricky balance of trying to expose a lot more games to people, but only to the people who we think want to play those games.'
