A five-year-old boy has been killed in Ireland's latest farming tragedy – the second in the past week.

Liam Lyons was fatally injured by a rotary mower at the rear of a tractor while a meadow was being mown yesterday afternoon in Co. Offaly.

The accident happened at around 3pm on a farm owned by a relative of the boy in Kincora near Ferbane.

He was airlifted by helicopter to the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore. 

Gardaí and the Health and Safety Authority are investigating the incident.

It’s the second farm tragedy in a number of days.

On Friday three-year-old Fionn Mulhall died from crush injuries after he was struck by a mechanical digger on the family’s farmyard outside Drimoleague near Bantry, Co. Cork.

Liam Lyon’s father, Eoin, work’s the family’s dairy farm in Rath, near Birr.

Mother Marian works as a HSE speech therapist although she is currently on maternity leave having given birth to a baby girl just weeks ago.

The couple have five children – all of whom are believed to be under the age of ten.

Mr Lyons is involved in the local GAA and coaches youth hurling in Drumcullen, including Liam’s own team.  

Rath parish priest Fr John Moorehead described the incident as a terrible family tragedy.

‘It’s a terrible family tragedy and has hit the family very hard,’ he said.

Meanwhile, the funeral of Fionn Mulhall took place yesterday in The Church of Mary Immaculate, Dromore, in Cork.

He he was buried in Drimoleague New Cemetery.

Fionn was the youngest son of farmer Gregory and teacher Imelda. He had three brothers – Luke, Greg and John.

He was the second child to die from crush-related injuries on a farmyard in Co. Cork over the last three months.

In May, 18-month-old Fionn Cashman, the youngest child of Con and Deirdre, died in a tragic accident on a farmyard outside Killeagh after being struck by a reversing tractor.

And last month two-year-old David Roche drowned in a container of water on the family farm in Limerick. 

At least 16 people have been killed on Irish farms this year with a high percentage of deaths related to tractors and other machinery.

Last year, 16 people died in farm-related accidents.
