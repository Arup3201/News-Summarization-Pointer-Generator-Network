Moving on: Disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has a new girlfriend who is two decades younger than him, it emerged today

Disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has a new girlfriend who is two decades younger than him, it emerged today.

The 63-year-old, who is still embroiled in a series of sex scandals, has already enjoyed a sun-kissed holiday with Myriam Aouffir, a high-profile press officer for French television.

It comes after Mr Strauss-Kahn's wife, Anne Sinclair, confirmed she has split from her scandal hit husband at the end of last month.

Ms Sinclair, 64, originally stuck by Mr Strauss-Kahn after he was embroiled in a catalogue of scandals since being charged with trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

The multi-millionaire heiress finally kicked her husband out of their Paris apartment in June, before immersing herself in a new job running an internet site in the French capital.

Now Ms Sinclair is faced with photographs of Mr Strauss-Kahn and his new 43-year-old girlfriend which appear in the latest edition of Paris magazine VSD.

They show Mr Strauss-Kahn canoodling with the 'bubbly single girl' Ms Aouffir who has a 'senior job in a big television chain'.

In fact Ms Aouffir is the online communications and social media marketing manager for France Television.

Like Strauss Kahn, Myriam L'Aouffir comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children

The attractive businesswoman has been seeing Mr Strauss-Kahn for around three months, say close friends of the couple

Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, she comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children.

Ms Aouffir, who studied at Montpellier University, has been seeing Mr Strauss-Kahn for around three months, say close friends of the couple.

They recently returned from a holiday
to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, where they stayed with Francois
Pupponi, the deputy mayor of the Paris suburb of Sarcelles.

Ms
Sinclair was originally severely criticised by feminists for sticking 
with Strauss-Kahn in the face of sordid allegations surrounding him.

Problems: Strauss-Kahn was forced to quit as the head of the IMF after he was accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo, pictured, at New York's Sofitel Hotel

Their 20-year marriage came under intense pressure as Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as a Socialist French president - was accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo at a Sofitel Hotel in New York.

After being held in the city's notorious Rikers Island prison, criminal charges were dropped but he still faces civil action for huge financial damages from his alleged victim.

He then returned to France last year only to face accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

French judges agreed there was a case against Strauss-Kahn, but had to drop it because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago.

Strauss-Kahn was then charged with conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

Strauss-Kahn is currently on bail for 100,000 euros and banned from leaving France while prosecutors decide if he should be brought to trial.

In the media frenzy that followed his return to France last year, it emerged he had had up to ten separate affairs during his marriage.

He confessed to regularly attending orgies and admitted he was addicted to a swingers' lifestyle.

A biography even told how Strauss-Kahn had once unsuccessfully attempted to seduce France's new First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler.

Neither Mr Strauss-Kahn nor Ms Aouffir would comment on their relationship.Â
