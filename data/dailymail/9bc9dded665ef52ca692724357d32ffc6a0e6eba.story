A painting that has been gathering dust in storage for decades has been identified as a £1m piece by 17th-century master, Sir Anthony van Dyck.

The portrait of a woman with spectacular pearl earrings and a red flowers in her hair was thought to have been an undistinguished copy, and lay languishing in a storage room at Bowes Museum in Durham.

But after being photographed for a project to put all the UK's oil paintings on one website, it was spotted by an art historian, who realised the significance of the work.

Historians say a previously unknown painting that has been stored at Bowes Museum in Durham is by Van Dyck and could be worth up to £1million.

After an investigation by BBC Two's Culture Show, it has been identified as a portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter, a lady in waiting to Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I.

Van Dyck expert Dr Christopher Brown told the programme it was a 'substantial discovery' and worth up to £1m.

Dr Brown, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, said: 'It's quite clear that this is a late English period Van Dyck. I don't think there's any doubt about that. This absolutely is Van Dyck at his best.'

The painting was covered in layers of dirt and varnish and was not on display at the Bowes Museum.

But it was photographed as part of the Public Catalogue Foundation's mission to document every oil painting in public ownership and added to the BBC's Your Paintings website, where it was spotted by art historian and dealer Dr Bendor Grosvenor.

'Although as part of our national heritage values are irrelevant, for insurance purposes it should now be valued at anything up to £1m,' Dr Grosvenor said.

'Had it appeared at auction as a copy, and in its dirty state, it would probably only have been estimated at about £3,000-5,000.'

Van Dyck, one of the finest portrait painters of the era, was born in Antwerp and became court artist for King Charles I in London in 1632.
