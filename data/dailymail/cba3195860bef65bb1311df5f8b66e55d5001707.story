Glamorous Dubai already boasts palatial hotels, sweeping desert and its very own city of Atlantis complete with dolphins.

Now the opulent emirate is about to gain another tourist attraction - and it may look familiar.

The latest development is a $1billion replica of India's Taj Mahal.

The real thing: Will Dubailand's Taj Arabia be as breathtaking as India's Taj Mahal?

Dubai's version of the iconic building will be named the Taj Arabia complex, and will include a 300-room hotel and shops.

'The Taj is made as a monument of love and we hope to promote this in Dubai as a major wedding destination,' said developer Arun Mehra.

The Taj Arabia will sit within the extravagant, 107-square-mile Dubailand, which the city hopes will be the 'world's greatest theme park'.

It will be divided into six theme worlds and will be twice the size of all the Disneyland and Disney World resorts put together

The Taj will be part of Falcon City, a large plot of land designed to resemble a falcon spreading its wings, which should be finished by around 2014.

High glamour: The project, which is likely to be finished by 2014, will be stuffed with shops, luxury hotels, apartments and restaurants

Futuristic: The Great Dubai Wheel will be one of the biggest in the world, dwarfing the London Eye and offering stunning views over the city

Falcon City will also feature scale reproductions of other wonders of the world including the Great Pyramid in Giza, the 
Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Coliseum and the Lighthouse at Alexandria, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Great Wall of China.

This being Dubai, the developers point 
out, the famous Pyramid 'includes retail and hotel space the ancient Egyptian 
architects would never have imagined!'

They have even placed a jogging track on one section of the Great Wall of China.

London Bridge, Big Ben, St Paul's 
Cathedral and Houses of Parliament will also be reproduced in the mind-boggling development, which will be bigger than Birmingham.

Tourists will also be able to gape at a version of the Las Vegas strip that will be four times as big as the real thing.

The Town of Venice situated on the waterfront is to house waterfront, open-air cafes, gondolas and pedestrian shopping, and luxury apartments for short lets.

There will be Tiger Woods-designed golf courses, a Formula 1 race track, luxurious villas and water parks.

Tourist heaven: Rollercoasters will stand beside the Tiger Woods golf course - but the noise will be blocked from apartments by the 'Great Wall of China'

The Pharaohs Theme Park will have multiple white-knuckle rides and roller coasters.

When announced in 2003, Dubailand was one of the world's most ambitious leisure development prososal, costing $4.3billion, but plans have been seriously set back global recession and Dubai's financial crisis.

The project was put on hold in 2008 but has now resumed.

The developers hope Falcon City will evoke the spirit of ancient civilizations for visitors, while celebrating the architectural marvels of the world.
