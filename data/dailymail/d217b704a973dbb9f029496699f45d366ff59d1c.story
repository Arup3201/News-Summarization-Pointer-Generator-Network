At Bloomfield Road last Saturday, Blackpool supporters arrived outside the turnstiles armed with buckets to rally the troops and collect funds for the Gary Parkinson Trust.

‘Parky’, as he is affectionately known, is the former Middlesbrough and Burnley defender who was working as a coach for Blackpool when struck down by locked-in syndrome in the autumn of 2010.

The locals are relentless in their support, and they were upset and angered to be told by stewards that they could not fund-raise within the grounds.

This is just one example of a club who appear to have lost their moral compass. This famous old club — whose most gifted forefathers include Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Armfield and Alan Ball — have plummeted from everyone’s favourite Premier League underdogs to an embarrassing basket case in three years.

Sportsmail has spent the week in Blackpool, talking to fans, players and former employees. It does not take long for a picture to emerge of a club bemused and angered in equal measure by the actions of chairman Karl Oyston and his family.

Our investigation uncovers the explosive truth behind the bedlam at Blackpool, where organisation, structure and common decency are foreign concepts to the chairman. Many supporters believe his only motivation is avarice.

When manager Jose Riga leads out his side at Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon, an illusion of normality will descend over the City Ground. This football club, however, are anything but normal.

Tough job: Jose Riga arrived to take over at Blackpool in July to find the club had just six professional players

Riga, a summer appointment, arrived at the dilapidated training ground in July to discover that he had only six professionals.

Since then, a bargain-basement approach to the transfer market has seen 12 players arrive in 12 days — midfielder Andrea Orlandi the latest on a one-year deal. 

They now have 19 but many are strangers to one another. A goalkeeper, Joe Lewis, was signed on a loan deal from Cardiff on Tuesday.

Lord only knows how Blackpool intend to defend set-pieces on Saturday. Not that Oyston will be there to witness it — he intends to jet off to Miami for his summer holiday.

Blackpool have banked £100million since falling from the Premier League in 2011 in parachute payments and transfer fees.

This summer their rotten core has been on public display, but the signs have been there for long enough. The working conditions that former manager Paul Ince was subjected to before he was dismissed in January after less than a year in charge reeked of Sunday League football. 

On away trips, senior members of staff would be expected to go to local supermarkets and buy ready meals of lasagne and spaghetti bolognese.

Addition: Midfielder Andrea Orlandi has also joined Blackpool on a one-year deal for the coming season

At the club’s Squires Gate training ground, players did their morning stretches with rain water splashing into buckets from the gymnasium’s leaky roof.

The facilities there — once described by former manager Ian Holloway as a ‘hell hole’ — are among the worst in the English game. ‘Terrible and a turn-off,’ was one scathing verdict this week. Last season, many players refused to shower, dodging the temperatures that veer between freezing and boiling, to head home after training. 

The club refused to respond to criticism of the facilities, as they did when approached by Sportsmail repeatedly by telephone and email over the past week. No wonder stalwarts have jumped ship.

Matt Williams, the long-serving secretary, is understood to have left for a better financial package at League Two Shrewsbury.

The last of the players from the Premier League team who were relegated in 2011, Matt Gilks, departed for Burnley after being offered a contract extension — with a 60 per cent wage cut — by text message.

The offer to Gilks, a long-standing servant, is symptomatic of the cost-cutting policies Oyston continues to employ. Players are paid £90 a week in the summer as they are not deemed to be ‘working’.

‘Everybody at this club is captive,’ explained one dressing-room source. ‘The players are unwanted trialists in need of a club or young players who need experience. The coaches or managers appointed tend to be out of favour and in need of one more chance. Nobody actually wants to be there, it’s a short-term stepping stone.’

Riga, appointed in June, already faces an uncertain future. The Chinese whispers suggest Noel Blake, the assistant manager, is being lined up as his replacement, while the name Billy Davies continues to crop up in discussions.

Valeri Belokon, the Latvian who owns 20% of the club, is disappointed the Oystons have not reinvested in the club...

'In the name of Blackpool Football Club I am very disappointed to hear that Karl Oyston refuses to escrow the last parachute payment to ensure a competitive team for the coming season. As I see it this will lead to a continuation of our current downward spiral - a negative result in a situation where it could be totally opposite.'

'We believe that last year’s result was the outcome of unsound policies pursued since 2011. In order to succeed one must have a clear strategy and an operating plan, which current management doesn’t have. Without a clear plan any venture is deemed to fail.'

'We have a good collaboration with newly formed BST Trust and helped them to arrange Trust launch party where all ticket revenue will go to Gary Parkinson Trust. We believe that football should be about people and local community.'

For the Blackpool supporters, the true victims among the wreckage, resentment intensifies over Oyston’s refusal to invest. This distressing script is now mimicking the best funfair rides in town, but the steady climb that captured the hearts of most fans has been followed by a relentless and frightening descent.

Supporters we spoke to despise Oyston for his failure to cement a legacy from the year they enjoyed in the Premier League.

Since earning promotion to the top flight in 2010, around £100m has entered Blackpool’s accounts. Official figures from the Premier League reveal that Blackpool have received £76.53m, including parachute payments and solidarity fees. They are soon due another injection of just under £10m from the Premier League. The club’s coffers have also been swelled by ticket sales, sponsorship agreements, merchandise and player sales. Charlie Adam and Matty Phillips left for a combined £14m while a tribunal fee is to be agreed for Thomas Ince’s move to Hull.

Only £5.5m has reportedly been spent on permanent signings since Blackpool were promoted.

This summer, most of the club’s youth team were released. The finest talent, Harrison McGahey, was offered a derisory contract and will drop down a division to play at Sheffield United.

It is estimated that at least £26m has been paid to the Oyston family — principally to father Owen, the convicted rapist — and their numerous businesses since 2011. The club’s former shorts sponsors, Bradley’s Builders, who did many jobs for the club, claim they were left bankrupt by Karl Oyston after a dispute over payments.

Owner Mark Bradley, who was an usher at Oyston’s wedding and went on family holidays with Karl, said: ‘We had to be put into receivership after 25-30 years in business. We have emigrated to Spain due to the personal embarrassment.’

Again, the Oyston family declined to comment.

The family this summer bought the Quernmore Park Hall estate in Lancashire, valued by one property website at £3.25m.

Karl Oyston’s son, Sam, regularly mocks supporters on social media, posting pictures of his plush cars on Twitter. Sam now has a minder to protect him.

Sam runs the Blackpool FC hotel, a separate business on the corner of the stadium, which fans believe is often prioritised before the club. Many of them are refusing to buy season tickets.

At the working men’s club over the road, fans are mulling over their next move. Tim Fielding, chairman of the Blackpool Supporters Trust, said: ‘We want Karl to put football first. Look at the hotel compared to the stadium. It is pristine with fancy furnishing. 

'In the stadium, you can see panels coming away from the ceiling and rust on the stands. Outside, there are weeds on the statue of the great Jimmy Armfield.

‘The relationship between the Oystons and fans is at its lowest ebb. If he’s not prepared to invest, give someone else a chance.’

Don’t bet on it. As long as there is money to be made, Oyston is likely to remain.
