Jailed: Michaella McCollum, 20, arrives at a court hearing in handcuffs. She told of the moment she first let her family know what had happened to her

Jailed drugs mule Michaella McCollum has told of the moment she phoned home with the news that she had been arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs out of Peru.

The 20-year-old, from Dungannon, County Tyrone said that the shock of finding out her daughter was in custody almost 6,000 miles away 'nearly killed' her mother.

She was last month sentenced to six years and eight months in prison, alongside Melissa Reid, also 20, with whom she was caught trying to smuggle 24lbs of cocaine out of Lima airport in August.

Miss McCollum's family launched a missing person appeal after she failed to answer her phone or update her Facebook page for more than a fortnight.

In fact she was being held in a police cell in Lima.

She remembered the moment her mother, Nora, picked up the phone, saying: 'As soon as she heard my voice she screamed "Michaella! My baby! I thought you were dead".'

'She started crying. Then I said "Mummy, I'm in jail. In Peru".' At this point, Miss McCollum said the phone went silent, according to Patricia Devlin at the Sunday Life newspaper in Belfast.

'I found out that after we'd spoken she 
had chest pains and was taken to hospital - I nearly killed her with the
 stress', she said.

Miss McCollum and Miss Reid, sometimes 
called the 'Peru two', decided to plead guilty to drugs trafficking in 
the hope of receiving a more lenient sentence.

The six years and eight months they were given is the minimum jail term for the offence. In return for the guilty plea, prosecutors did not pursue allegations that the women had been paid to carry the drugs.

Sentence: Miss McCollum, right, and Miss Reid, left, were given sentences of six years and eight months for drug trafficking. They are shown attending a court hearing last month

Filthy: The 'Peru Two' were both sent to  Santa Monica prison - an overcrowded and unhygienic jail rife with HIV and tuberculosis

Inmates: Santa Monica prison, where the women were held, was built for 250 women but holds more than 1,000

As their sentence is under seven years, the possibility remains open that they can be transferred to a prison in the UK - though the governments in both countries would have to agree to the transfer.

The pair had been working at bars in Ibiza before they made the trip to Peru. They originally claimed to have been kidnappedÂ  by a gang in Ibiza and forced to travel to Peru.

Though they did not pursue that defence in court, Miss Reid has maintained that she attempted to smuggle the drugs 'under duress'.
