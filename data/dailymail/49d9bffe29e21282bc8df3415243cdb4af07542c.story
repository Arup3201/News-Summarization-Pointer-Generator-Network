Wasps' £30million takeover bid for Coventry's Ricoh Arena looks set to receive the green light from politicians in the Midlands city.

Coventry City councillors told a public meeting on Tuesday of their intention to support Wasps' purchase of the council-run Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), the company that runs the Ricoh ground.

Councillors confirmed in the meeting that Wasps plan to build a new training base in the city, relocating from their west London set-up in Acton.

Sky Bet League One football club Coventry City will continue to host home matches at the Ricoh ground, while Coventry politicians were at pains to safeguard the future of Coventry Rugby Club.

Coventry's council were locked in a private vote over the mooted sale late on Tuesday afternoon, with the outcome expected to be revealed later.

Coventry City Council leader, Coun Ann Lucas (Lab, Holbrooks), told the meeting: 'Wasps have spent years looking for a home that will help them fulfil their ambitions and visions.

'They believe the Ricoh Arena could become one of the best sporting arenas in Europe: we believe that too.

'Our main objective is to make sure Coventry is not disadvantaged in any way.

'It is no secret we have been negotiating with Wasps.

'We know they are absolutely focused on delivering success for their club, the Ricoh and Coventry.

'The benefit to having a top rugby club playing here alongside a successful football club is enormous.

'When Wasps played a Heineken Cup match here in 2007, it brought about £6million into the local economy.'

Wasps owner Derek Richardson made a six-hour presentation to Coventry councillors in late-night talks on Monday ahead of the crucial vote.

Wasps have been based at Wycombe's Adams Park for 12 years, but their search for a permanent home was accelerated by Irish businessman Richardson's club takeover in April 2013.

Opposition leader, Coun John Blundell (Con, Wainbody), told Tuesday's meeting the Tory group would lend its support to Wasps' bid.

'After some initial reservations, and after listening to the arguments and after many hours of discussion, we will be minded to support the resolution subject to further consideration in private,' he said.

'If Wasps are successful they would want to build a training facility in the Coventry area.

'They also want to develop rugby in the community, which alongside the work Coventry Rugby Club do will also be of great benefit to young people across the city.

'We have sought assurances that Coventry City football club will be able to continue with their current arrangements at the Ricoh, and that Coventry Rugby Club will be fully involved in future rugby discussions with Wasps if a deal goes ahead.

'We have received assurances on both of these matters.'
