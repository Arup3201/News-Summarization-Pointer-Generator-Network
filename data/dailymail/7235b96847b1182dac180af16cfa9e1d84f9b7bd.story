One minute the house is there, the next it's fallen 350ft into a gold mine in Kazakstan.

A solitary room of the cottage is left standing precariously on a cliff edge after the rest subsided into the Altyn-Tau Vostok pit.

Astonishingly, the three residents of the house escaped safely, said officials in eastern Kazakhstan.

The hole left by the collapsing house was 180ft wide.

A total of 480 miners were evacuated from the gold mine, with no casualties, reported the emergency services.

The goldmine is part of Kazzinc, which is owned by Anglo-Swiss outfit Glencore Xstrata plc, a multinational headquartered in Baar, Switzerland with its registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey.

Residents of other homes were also evacuated amid fears of further collapses.

Two miners were killed in an accident in the same Altyn-Tau Vostok mine complex in November last year.
