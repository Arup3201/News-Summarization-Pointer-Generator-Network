A host of Juventus and Real Madrid legends went head-to-head in the UNESCO Cup in Turin on Monday evening.

Zinedine Zidane, who left Juventus to sign for Madrid in a Â£46million deal back in 2001, turned out for both sides as Real claimed a 5-1 victory.

Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf, who
 won three Champions League winners' medals with Real, Ajax and AC 
Milan during a glittering career, rolled back the years to score a 
belter of a volley for the visitors.

The former Holland international - who is the current AC manager - made the goal look easy, watching the ball 
all the way down before unleashing an unstoppable volley from 25 yards out which left the goalkeeper with no chance.

Both
 clubs boasted a number of world-class players amongst their ranks as 
the likes of Pavel Nedved, Mauro Camoranesi and Edgar Davids starred for
 the Bianconeri against Madrid legends including Claude Makelele, 
Christian Karembu and Fernando Morientes.

The 
majority of players appearing at the Juventus Stadium are now managers 
but showed they can still play in an entertaining game.

While Seedorf wowed at one end of the pitch, Juventus defender Ciro Ferrera impressed at the other, producing an impressive overhead kick to clear the ball from danger.

Morientes opened the scoring for Madrid, netting a typically accurate header from a Karembu cross before Zidane doubled Real's lead against the side he would play for in the second half. Midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi responded for Juventus just before half-time.

However, Spanish giants Madrid turned on the style after the interval as substitutes Reuben De La Red and Enrique Velasco scored to add to Seedorf's wonder strike.

Former
 Middlesbrough striker Fabrizio Ravanelli appeared for the Italians while current Riverside boss Aitor Karanka started the game
 in the heart of the Madrid defence alongside Real legend Fernando 
Hierro.

Proceeds from the match will fund a global research programme into the problem of racism and discrimination in sport.
