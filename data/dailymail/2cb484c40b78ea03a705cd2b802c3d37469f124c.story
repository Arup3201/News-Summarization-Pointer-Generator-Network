A 16-year-old died Saturday during an Atlanta-bound flight to visit his military veteran father for Christmas.

The teen boy, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac after a medical emergency 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle, Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer told MailOnline.

The boy was flying with his mother, grandmother and another sibling to visit his father stationed at McChord Air Force Base but was outside Atlanta for unknown reasons, according to Mr Schaeffer.

The boy and his family were flying to Atlanta to spend time with his father for the Christmas holiday when he went into cardiac arrest, Mr Schaeffer explained.

‘The majority of the family went on the plane to fly down to Georgia this afternoon,’ he added.

There is no indication as to why the unidentified boy had the medical emergency, but passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline the flight crew notified people on-board the boy had cerebral palsy.

Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, said Mr Schaeffer, but he did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected.

'It was an expected event by any means,' he said.

The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, said Mr Ryan.

The flight crew immediately sprung into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone – including passengers – remained calm and collected through out.

‘It was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back of the plane,’ said Mr Ryan. ‘They started performing CPR on him… the pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency landing.’

‘We were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boy’s life,' Mr Ryan added.

Emergency personnel were already on their way when the plane touched down.

‘We met them on the ground with our fire fighter paramedics and attempted resuscitate him for well over 30 minutes,’ Mr Schaeffer said.

‘Paramedics rushed on to the plane, you could tell there was a lot of urgency… then everything calmed down and you could put two and two together,’ Mr Ryan lamented.

The boy was pronounced dead on the plane.

His body was removed by ladder from the back of the plane, according to Mr Ryan.

The deceased boy’s devastated family was put up in a local hotel which is being paid for by charities linked to the Spokane Fire and Police Departments, as well as Spokane International Airport.

The father is expected to arrive in Spokane early Saturday evening.

‘We’re doing everything we can for them,’ Mr Schaeffer said.

A preliminary cause of death has not yet been determined, but an autopsy is expected to take place within 24 hours.

A Delta spokesperson told MailOnline the flight, which originally had about 250 passengers is expected resume later Saturday and land in Atlanta about 7 hours later than its originally scheduled time.
