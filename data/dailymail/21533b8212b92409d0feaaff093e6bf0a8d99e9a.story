From porkpies to stetsons and trilbies, we've seen several styles of the fedora hat pop up on the high street during the past few years, and now is the time to embrace it once again.

The perfect cover up for your head for this season, felt varieties keep you warm during chilly January and will see you right through to May, when you can replace it for a sunny straw style.

Catherine Zeta Zones and Myleene Klass both stepped out in stylish fedoras yesterday, showcasing the trend to perfection.

Fedora is a broad terms for a variety of hat styles that traditionally made with a fairly low crown creased lengthwise and a brim that can be turned up or down.

They can be 'pinched' in several ways, including in the middle at the top, with teardrop crowns or centre dents.

The term fedora was used in reference to the type of hat from as early as 1891. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking Homburg hat.

The word fedora, though, comes from the title of an 1882 play by dramatist Victorien Sardou, 'Fédora', written for Sarah Bernhardt.

The hat was very popular in the 1920s through to the early 1950s, but in the late 50s it fell out of fashion as style shifted towards a more casual aesthetic - but they've been back in style since the mid-70s and we're embracing the trend more than ever today.
