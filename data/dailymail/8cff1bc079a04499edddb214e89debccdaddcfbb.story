After being reunited in the Match of the Day studios at the World Cup in Brazil, Ruud Gullit and Alan Shearer will be continuing to see a lot more of each other with Gullit joining the MOTD team for the upcoming season.

The pair fell out when Gullit was Shearer's manager at Newcastle, but after laughing and joking during punditry work at the World Cup it was clear to see they had put the past behind them. 

Gullit is not the only new face to join the team, with Rio Ferdinand and Phil Neville part of the new-look MOTD team.

Friends again: The pair eventually shook hands after sharing a joke about the incident 15 years ago

At it again: Gullit and Shearer engaged in some good banter during the World Cup

Younger days: Gullit alongside Shearer as the latter pens a contract extension at Newcastle in July 1999

Further opportunity: Neville will BBC Radio Five Live and working on Football Focus

Neville's infamous monotone commentary on England's opening World Cup match against Italy - which prompted 445 complaints - has not prevented the BBC from appointing the former Manchester United and Everton midfielder to its team of pundits for the highlights show.

He will also be covering games with BBC Radio Five Live and working on Football Focus.

The new faces were needed following Alan Hansen's decision to retire from his role as a pundit on the programme after the World Cup following 22 years of service.

In total the BBC will screen over 12 hours of weekend football television coverage from this season.

Among those additions will be a Sunday morning repeat of the Football League  show on BBC Two.

After a six-year absence the  FA Cup is also returning to BBC Television, with 16 live matches set to be broadcasted on the road to Wembley, as well as highlights of every round.
