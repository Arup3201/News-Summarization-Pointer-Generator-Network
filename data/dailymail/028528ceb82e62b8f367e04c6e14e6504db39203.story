The number of gadgets and sleeping aids that  flood the travel market is enough to bewilder even the most experienced travellers, but a new sleep mask is here to help. 

Finnish brand Active Ally Oy has come up with a new solution to an old problem. 

Designers have developed a sleeping mask, Relax ALLY, that fastens to the seat behind you and prevents your head from lolling forwards or too far sideways while you snooze.

Fully adjustable: The ergonomic position helps you to fall asleep and allows the muscles to relax

According to the brand, which launched in November 2012, the ergonomic position helps you to fall asleep and allows muscles to relax, preventing micro trauma, prolonged flexion and resulting stiffness and pain to the neck and shoulders.

It’s fully adjustable, designed to prolong sleep and costs €39 (£30). Better yet, it should prevent that awkward moment when you awake and realise you’ve nodded off on a stranger’s shoulder.

Integrated features include; a restband for better ergonomics, a sleeping mask to exclude light and a pocket with earplugs for isolating noise.

The Relax ALLY travel restband has been sold in over twenty countries but now the company wants to grow globally and is looking for equity investors through the international FundedByMe crowdfunding platform.

Sleep sound: So far 15 per cent of the total has been raised of the total €100,000 needed

This €100,000 (£80,000) crowdfinding round would help unlock up to  €300,000 (£240,000) for operational use to support development and international growth around the EU and USA, then  Asia.

So far, 15 per cent of the total has been raised, with 42 days left to go.

‘The problem is simply huge and for some reason people just seems to have accepted it. We wanted to wake-up people by releasing the campaign during the Halloween week with a themed travel nightmare introduction video, and show them a viable solution with huge potential says Mr. Lasse Korvala, CEO of Active Ally Oy’
