LA Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant laid into his team-mates with a series of expletive-laden rants as he compared them to toilet paper during a practice session on Thursday.

The Lakers have endured a torrid start to their season, losing 16 of their 22 NBA games, and Bryant appeared to lose his temper as he criticised the players for being soft.

The 36-year-old has missed most of the team's sessions this season as the coach bids to keep the veteran fresh for games.

But on Thursday Bryant returned to practice for the the first this month as the team contested a heated five-on-five scrimmage.

'You motherf****** are soft like Charmin (toilet paper brand),' Bryant was reported to have yelled by ESPN's Arash Markazi.

'God damn, is this the type of s*** that's going on in these practices? Now I see why we've lost 20 f****** games. We're soft like Charmin. We're soft like s***.'

After the session Bryant said that his ranting was just his way of motivating his team-mates during practice

After the session Bryant had some choice words for general manager Mitch Kupchak. 

'I'm supposed to practice and get better, Mitch. I'm supposed to practice and get better. These motherf****** ain't doing s*** for me.'

Afterwards Bryant played down his rant as nothing more than a way of increasing intensity during practice and motivating his team-mates.

'I was just being myself,' Bryant said. 'I don't know if it helps them, but it obviously raises the intensity level.'
