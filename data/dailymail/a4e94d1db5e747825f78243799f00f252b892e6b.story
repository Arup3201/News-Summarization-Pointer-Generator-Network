Police believe this suspected burglar may have been so dim he took a picture of himself on a stolen iPad and sent it back to his victim

He could turn out to be one of the stupidest criminals of all time.

Police believe this suspected burglar was so dim he took a photo of himself on a stolen iPad and sent it back to his victim.

The image was automatically streamed back to the owner's iPhone from a tablet which was stolen during a break-in before Christmas.

Two Apple monitors, a Blackberry mobile 
phone, purses containing cash and cards, an iPad and a black iPod touch 
were taken during a raid on a house in Newton Burgoland, 
Leicestershire.

Now detectives at Leicestershire police are hoping the unexpected piece of evidence will help them solve the case and have released the photo in a bid to track the man down.

The burglars broke into the property through the back door some time between December 12 and 13 last year.

Detective Constable Ania Chajecka is hoping someone will recognise the man or he will hand himself in.

She
said: 'We are keen to trace the man pictured as he appears to have 
taken a photo of himself on the stolen iPad which has then been streamed
to the victim's iPhone.

'This
man may or may not be connected to this burglary so we would urge him 
or anyone who recognises him to please contact police immediately.'
