A man who fled the country after being convicted of child molestation a decade ago was sentenced Friday to 240 years in prison.

Steven Dyer was sentenced on 12 counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of public sexual indecency.

Dyer was returned to Arizona after being arrested in February as he passed through Montreal's Trudeau airport.

Authorities say the 44-year-old Dyer had assumed the identity of a Canadian citizen and was living in Vancouver, although he also travelled frequently to Central America and South America.

While living in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale, Dyer was accused of molesting two boys he befriended over an 18-month period between 1999 and 2001.

According to the Phoenix New Times, Dyer’s bond was first set at $2.5million after his arrest, but it was then lowered to $100,000.

When Dyer posted bond, he fled up north.

Commissioner Patricia Starr sentenced him to 240 years, much higher than the minimum 169 years the 12 counts of sexual conduct with a minor warranted.

Dyer was tried in absentia and convicted in 2002.

According to his profile on America’s Most Wanted, Dyer worked as a pharmaceutical representative in wealthy Scottsdale, Arizona.

The University of California – Berkeley grad also spent his spare time volunteering with Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America.

But during that time, Dyer made friends with a young boy and gained his trust by supplying him with alcohol and taking him on trips.

He molested the boy for a period of 18 months before the boy’s father went to the police.
