Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children must give up their childcare payments from the government unless care is quarantined to the home, according to a new report.

This hard-line approach to immunisation is part of the recommendations handed down by the Productivity Commission's report into childcare.

The report warns that access to government rebates for childcare should only be handed out if the child is fully immunised in order to protect them from preventable diseases.

While parents are required to vaccinate their children to receive benefits, they can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated. 

The Productivity Commission's report now recommends rebates 'be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home'. 

Childcare centres in NSW can ban children that are not immunised and other states are currently considering similar tough stances. 

'The commission makes some very important suggestions in this area. I am open to everything in the report. I am not ruling anything in or out,' Social Services Minister Scott Morrison told the Sunday Telegraph.

Labor leader Bill Shorten told the newspaper the commission's recommendation were a 'common-sense measure'.

'Kids deserve to grow up safe and healthy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said.

'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn't have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.' 

Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to anything in the report and admitted it made some very important suggestions in the area of immunisations
