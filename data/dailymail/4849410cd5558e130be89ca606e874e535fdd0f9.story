Beverley Jeffs, from Derbyshire, tampered with her own medical files and forged a signature on an elderly man's will, Derby Crown Court was told

A care home manager posed as the long-lost daughter of an  elderly resident as part of  an attempt  to inherit £300,000 from him, a court heard.

Beverley Jeffs, 52, allegedly altered William Mansfield's will to make herself the beneficiary of 40 per cent of his £760,000 estate.

The changed will bequeathed a new minibus to the home, promised another employee £10,000 and said that staff and residents were to have 'a good night on me', Derby Crown Court heard.

Mr Mansfield, a former Rolls-Royce engineer, lived at Overseal Residential Home in Derbyshire, and his will was kept in the safe.

After his death at the age of 82 in April 2009, the document was passed to his cousin, Terry Mansfield, who became suspicious and called in police.

When she was questioned, Jeffs claimed to be William Mansfield's daughter, said prosecutor Justin Wigoder.

She even altered her medical records to add Mr Mansfield as her father, and wrote to Terry Mansfield claiming that a DNA test had proved with 99 per cent certainty that she was his late cousin's daughter, said Mr Wigoder.

He said: 'The conclusive
evidence from the hand-writing expert is the signatures of Mr Mansfield on the
will are not genuine signatures written by him. They are forgeries.'

Mr Wigoder added: 'Rather unfortunately,
for a short period, she was left alone with her records.

'She seized the opportunity
to make false entries, putting Mr Mansfield down as her father.'

Ms Jeffs, 52-year-old former manager of the Overseal Residential Home in Swadlincote, Derby, denies eight counts of fraud and two theft charges relating to two residents' cash

Jeffs also allegedly stole £51,000 from a second resident at the home by writing cheques from the pensioner's chequebook.

Jeffs, of Newhall, Derbyshire, denies eight charges of fraud and two of theft. She and three other defendants, including her daughter Rachael Jeffs, 31, also deny converting criminal property relating to the transfer of a car.

Jeffs no longer works at the home. The trial continues.
