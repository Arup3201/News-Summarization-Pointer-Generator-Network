There's a neat weatherboard house in far western Melbourne where the five members of the Van Den Hende family were supposed return after a wonderful holiday together in Europe.

The home is still full of their belongings but the family will never return, and now the town of the Eynesbury, 50km west of Melbourne, is struggling to come to terms with their loss.

'It's a difficult thing to comprehend,' close family friend, Tanya Willmott told Daily Mail Australia.

'The house where they were living is there with their belongings, but they have just disappeared.

'We just hope that with what's going on over there [in Ukraine] that all five members of the family are able to be found and returned.'

Much liked, never forgotten: The five members of the Van Den Hende family (pictured), Mum Shaliza, 45, Margot, 8, Dad Hans, 48, elder son Piers, 15 , and Marnix, 12, tragically died in the MH17 disaster when they were returning from Europe on a family holiday. Their sudden absence from the tight knit community in which they lived has left friends and classmates at a loss

Filled with belongings, empty of people: the community of Eynesbury in far western Melbourne are guarding the house (pictured) belonging to the Van Den Hende family following the loss of all five family members in the MH17, but there is a sense of bewilderment at the fact that they will never seen their friends again

Hans Van Den Hende, 48, his wife Shaliza Dewa, 45, and their children Piers, 15, Marnix, 12 and Margaux, 8, lived in Australia for just five years and at their house in Eynesbury for just under three years.

But they forged deep bonds in the community in that short time, especially as the Van Den Hende children forged those friendship bonds with others they played soccer and swam with or spent their time socialising with. To have this entire family ripped from such a small, tight knit community has left the town with a profound sense of loss, which the empty house and the lack of a final resting place only amplifies.

At the memorial Ms Wilmott organised last Sunday at Eynesbury Homestead, which drew 500 people from all the walks of the Van Den Hende family's life, child after child took the microphone to express their shock and dismay at the tragedy.

Team mates of Piers Van Den Hende from the Melton Phoenix under 15s Football Club laid tributes at last Sunday's memorial at Eynesbury Homestead west of Melbourne. Piers was a 'courageous' goal keeper and team mate Lucas said of his death, 'we don't know what to do. We are all heartbroken

'He was just the nicest kid': Piers Van Den Hende, 15, (left) the eldest of the children was remembered by his football and class mates as 'one of the nicest kids you ever met' and 'always such a positive person'. Margaux Van Den Hende, 8, (right) was 'a beautiful little girl' who had 'lots of friends'. The three Van Den Hende children were popular, loved living in Australia and in the western Melbourne town of Eynesbury where they loved the bush and the freedom of riding their bikes

Family friend Tanya Willmott (pictured, centre, in knitted brown top) and her children knew the Van Den Hende family and well and said of their sudden loss, 'it's a difficult thing to comprehend. The house where they were living is there with their belongings, but they have just disappeared. We just hope that with what's going on over there [in Ukraine] that all five members of the family are able to be found and returned'

A crowd of fine hundred friends from all the walks of the Van Den Hende family's lives - football, swimming, school, work - gathered at the Eynesbury Homestead on Sunday to remember them. Child after child got up and wept at the loss of their cherished mates

The five Van Den Hendes had been on a family holiday to Europe where, according to Hans' sister, Franka, they had 'just had a wonderful holiday going back to where they had met in the UK during their PhD studies, to my brother's home country the Netherlands and their family, and a week with my sister and their family in Denmark'.

That they didn't return, one friend who had played golf with Piers responded: 'I can’t understand they are gone. It’s such a disaster. I hope they are somewhere better now'.

Piers' team mate, Lucas, from the Melton Phoenix under 15s Football Club, put it this way: 'We don’t know what to do. We are all heartbroken'.

Counselling: fellow students of Bacchus Marsh College have received counselling following the death of the Van Den Hende family in MH17, and school principal Andrew Neal said a special place at the school allowed grieving students to lay flowers, cards and teddy bears in their memory

Forever missed: Although the three Van Den Hende children travelled on Netherlands passports and had only lived in Australia since 2009, they were both loved by their Australian friends and they loved 'the Aussie lifestyle' of the town of Eyenesbury 40km west of Melbourne's CBD

A friend of Marnix said: 'His Mum was one of the nicest mums. His father was very good. [Marnix] was very positive and nice. It is heartbreaking and shocking what happened.'

Members of the Melton Swimming Club, of which Marnix was a member and talented butterflyer, spoke about the occasion he first made the Victorian state team.

'His Mum was so bright. I made my first state with Marnix and his Mum was up there jumping in the grandstand.'

A friend of Piers remebered him as 'nice to everyone and one of the best kids I ever met in my life'.

Ms Willmott said she got to know Shaliza because their children were around the same age and all went to the same school, ICA Melton College in nearby Caroline Springs. When the school closed suddenly, the two families transferred their kids to Bacchus Marsh College.

Beautiful family: although the Australian friends of the Van Den Hende family (pictured) know that their final resting place will likely be in father Hans' homeland of the Netherlands or mother Shaliza's homeland of Malaysia, they are praying for the return of all five family members' remains from the difficult process of recovery and identification that is proceeding in the Ukraine and Holland

'She was just a beautiful person, so down to earth you would almost call her Australian,' she said.

'She was always happy and so fit. She looked after her mind and body.

'She loved the outdoors and the natural setting out here where you get kangaroos on the golf course,' Ms Willmott told Daily Mail Australia.

'Shaliza really took to the Australian lifestyle. It sounds like a cliché but it was a positive experience meeting this family. They touched people and you didn't forget them.

Coming to terms: the suddenness of loss following the MH17 tragedy is being felt keenly in the tight knit community of Eyenesbury in western Melbourne which lost the five member Van Den Hende family

'That's why it's so difficult. There are families on two continents and we don't know yet where their final resting place will be.

'I'm not expecting it to be in Australia, but with all these horrendous details, whether all five are there [among the bodies waiting to be identified] or not that also very much on your mind.

'Their house? I would assume there would be family coming out and we are getting together, different groups, to talk about some permanent memorial, something at Eynesbury, at the school and in the sporting groups.

'But we are making sure the house is secure in the meantime.'

Bacchus Marsh College principal Andrew Neal told Daily Mail Australia the school had offered counselling to its pupils and had a special place at the school where children had been leaving flowers, notes and teddy bears at a statue of a mother and child which had been crafted by a former student.

He praised the 'resilience' of the Van Den Hende's class mates and said a permanent plaque would be placed on a tree in the school grounds.

Of the grisly news about the gathering of the victims' remains, he said he had counselled parents to monitor the school childrens' intake of news.

He said of what had taken place at the crime scene in Ukraine: 'It's reminiscent of some 19th century picking over of the battlefield, something you would have thought would have died out 150 years ago.'
