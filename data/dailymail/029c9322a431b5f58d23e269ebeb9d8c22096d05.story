A five year old girl is fighting for her life after she was raped by a neighbour in Gandhi Nagar, east Delhi, who held her captive for four days.

The girl was kidnapped while playing outside her home and locked in her neighbour’s flat for days before someone heard her cries for help.

Doctors reported finding ‘foreign objects’ inside the girl’s genitals as the details of her horrific ordeal began to unfold.

Horror: The five-year-old rape victim is covered by a sheet as she is transported to a specialist unit from Swami Dayanand Hospital, Delhi, today

The five-year-old went missing from her home on Monday and was found on Thursday night by rescuers, alerted by her screams, in the home of a man who lives in the same building as the girl’s family.

The neighbour is believed to have repeatedly raped the child, mutilated her genitals and tried to strangle her.

Doctors at Swami Dayanand hospital in Dehli said they found foreign objects inside the girl, including a 200ml bottle and parts of a broken candle.

She also suffered injuries and bruising to her chest, lips and cheeks.

Abused: Doctors said it was 'one of the worst cases' they had seen following the discovery of a broken candle and a bottle inside the little girl's private parts resulting in serious infection

Dr R.K. Bansal who examined the girl said it was ‘one of the worst cases’ he had ever seen, and that the next 48 hours will be crucial in determining her chances of survival.

‘She was scared and not fully conscious,’ he told Hindustani Times. ’Initially, she did not allow us to proceed with the examination as she was in tremendous pain.’

This is the third alleged rape of a 
minor this month in the Delhi area. Earlier this week a ten-year-old was
 allegedly raped on a bus after the driver, also in this case a 
neighbour, lured her away from her home.

Last
 week another girl, also aged ten, was allegedly raped by a neighbour and then 
locked in a cell by police after her family tried to report the crimes.

The case triggered protests outside Swami Dayanand hospital with masses condemning the acts of the accused and condemning the government for not providing better care and the police for not acting on the parent’s missing child report.

The girl’s family claim the police had tried to bribe them with 2,000 rupees (£24) to keep quiet after their daughter was rescued and refused to treat it as a rape case.

Public fury: Angry protestors block the car of Delhi State Education Minister Kiran Walia, who arrived at the hospital to visit the girl's family, as public outrage spread following the incident - the third involving a minor in the past two weeks

‘She went out to play when she was kidnapped. The man then locked her up in his room and raped her. I want justice from the government,’ the girl's mother told The Hindu.

‘Yesterday night (a policeman came and asked me to come out. He told me nothing will happen by involving public. He told me that you should take care of the child and be with her. Public would not help you and he also handed me Rs. 2,000 and left. He said I should cover my pocket expenses from this money,’ the victim's father alleged.

Delhi Police refute the allegations.

Today, as the girl was transferred to All India Institute of Medical Sciences in order to be given better care, Delhji Police reported to have identified the alleged rapist.

‘The accused has been identified and a team is already on its way to arrest him," Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar told Hindustani Times.
