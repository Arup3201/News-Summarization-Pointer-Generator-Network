It stood tall over the city's skyline for 27 years. But it took only seconds for the two towers of the Haitian Hotel to be reduced to rubble.

The five star hotel, one of the oldest in its province, was considered elderly by modern standards and was ordered to make way for a younger model.

It was demolished this morning before rush hour in a controlled explosion so it would not damage neighbouring buildings in Qingdao in China's eastern Shandong province.

The hotel's two towers collapsed on themselves following the detonation of explosives

Residents were kept well away from the demolition by a 200m exclusion zone around the former hotel as a safety precaution.

The detonation of the explosives was planned to beat the rush hour traffic, happening between 5am and 6am today.

A five foot-wide trench dug six feet deep reduced the impact of shockwaves from the blast, according to Best News.

Explosives were carefully positioned around the building made sure the towers collapsed on themselves, keeping things as neat as possible.

The hotel had more than 600 rooms overlooking the sea before its closure and had last been renovated in 2003, according to eLong.com.

Guests could play tennis on the 
hotel's own courts or swim in its pool before enjoying massages and spa 
facilities. They could choose from Chinese, Korean, Japanese or Western 
cuisine, the site said.

The towers stood 26 and 14 storeys high respectively over Qingdao in Shandong province, eastern China

The demolition of the hotel buildings has left a gap in the Qingdao skyline but they will soon be replaced by new developments

When it's not possible to knock a tall building over into an empty space, explosives experts have to plot devices at specific points around the building to make sure it collapses into its own footprint.

The blasts on the building's support structure make levels crash down on top of each other. Planting explosives at some of the higher levels helps the building to break into smaller pieces on its way down. This leaves a pile of rubble, which is easier to clear away.

Often, the workers will ensure the internal support columns are destroyed first, so the outside walls fall into the centre and minimise damage to surrounding buildings.

To prepare for the blast, walls that don't bear a load are usually removed. Sometimes workers may try to make support walls weaker by hitting them with sledgehammers.

Dynamite stuffed into holes takes care of concrete, while steel structures need an explosive called RDX, which explodes at up to 27,000ft per second, according to How Stuff Works.

Once a safety cordon is in place, it's time to detonate, where all that preparation results in blasters needing only seconds to bring the building down.

A team of explosive experts planned the blast so that other buildings in the area would not be affected

Dirt and dust from the explosion clouded over the site, where traffic measures kept people away for safety
