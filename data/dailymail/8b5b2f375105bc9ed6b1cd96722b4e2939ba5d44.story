A man's body was left on the floor of an ambulance station near to bins because paramedics wanted to go home on time, it has been claimed.

A whistleblower has alleged that the body of 32-year-old James Harrison was left at Ely Ambulance Station for over an hour when it should have been taken straight to a hospital mortuary.

They said that his body was left dumped next to bins because the medics were determined to finish their shift on time when it should have been taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

The alleged incident has now prompted an investigation, which has been launched by the East of England Ambulance Service.

The ambulance service insider said the 999 crew from Downham Market responded to the call to collect Mr Harrison's body from outside Ely Fire Station.

However, he claimed that because the crew were about to finish a night shift, they didn't want to make the trip to Cambridge.

The anonymous whistleblower said: 'Standard practice would be for paramedics to transport the body to the mortuary.

'But on the day the body was left on the station floor next to the bins for more than an hour, which raises serious issues of dignity and decency.

'I have never experienced anything like this in my career, it was totally wrong.

'When the day crew came in, about an hour later, they found the body there.

Mr Harrison was found dead in the early hours of September 24 near Littleport fire station. Police spent three days at the scene, pictured, before it was ruled there was no evidence of foul play 

'I understand there have been statements taken but they [the ambulance service] haven’t done anything about it yet.'

An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed: 'An incident last month involving the transportation of a deceased patient is under investigation and as such we cannot comment any further.'

He added that they would be contacting Mr Harrisons’s family to keep them up to date with the progress of the probe.

Mr Harrison was found dead in the early hours of September 24 near Littleport Fire Station.

Police and forensic experts spent three days at the street scene before a post mortem examination ruled there was no evidence of foul play.

Further tests are set to be carried out in a bid to establish how Mr Harrison died.

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned until January 14 by William Morris, senior coroner for North and East Cambridgeshire.
