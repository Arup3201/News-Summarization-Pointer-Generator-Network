Edmond Alexandre has been fined more than $7,000 after his fury over a reclined seat saw the plane he was on diverted

A passenger who forced a plane to divert after becoming furious with a woman in front of him who had reclined her seat has been fined more than $7,000.

Edmond Alexandre, 61, became irate after a woman reclined the seat in front of him on the Miami-to-Paris flight in August last year.

A U.S. District Court in Boston heard how the man began to argue with the woman and other passengers, before chasing a flight attendant down the aisle where he 'grabbed his arm'.

The federal judge decided to impose a a $1,000 (£675) fine and restitution of $6,303 (£4,300) to American Airlines.

Alexandre, who is a Haitian national, was flying back to  Paris, where he lives, when the plane was forced to divert to Logan Airport in Boston.

Two undercover federal air marshals aboard the plane then subdued Alexandre and handcuffed him, the U.S. attorney's office said.

Massachusetts state police arrested Alexandre when the diverted plane landed.

Four hours later the American Airlines flight resumed its journey onwards to France.

U.S. media agencies report that Alexandre could have been facing 20 years in prison.

The incident came just days after a United Airlines flight diverted to Chicago following a fight between two passengers over a reclined seat.

United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver was forced to make an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport Sunday after a female passenger threw water at a man seated behind her who used a device known as Knee Defender to stop her from reclining her seat on the four-hour flight.

The two passengers, both age 48, were interviewed by Chicago police, who deemed the incident a 'customer service issue,' according to Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein.

The plane then continued to Denver without them, arriving 1 hour and 38 minutes late, according to the airline's website.

The Federal Aviation Administration can impose a civil fine of up to $25,000 for passengers who are unruly.

In this case, no arrest was made, according to airport spokesman Gregg Cunningham.

And then just days after the incident involving Mr Alexandre, a row between two women over a reclined seat led to the diversion of a New York to Palm Beach Delta flight to Jacksonville.

According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat.

Passenger Aaron Klipin told the station a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her.

The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table.

Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew.

According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted.

The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman.

A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane.

The three incidents in the space of some nine days on U.S. airlines became known as legroom wars.
