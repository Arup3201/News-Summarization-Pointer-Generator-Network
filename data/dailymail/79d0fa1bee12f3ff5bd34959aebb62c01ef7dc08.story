A descendant of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand has said his family should take no blame for the outbreak of the First World War.

The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand is widely considered to have triggered the start of the conflict, which killed 37million people, 100 years ago.

But Karl Habsburg-Lothringen has insisted to journalists that his family have no need to show any remorse for the war - because they do not need to 'redeem' themselves for anything.

Archduke Ferdinand was shot in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip, who was 19 years old.

This action, on June 28, 1914, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia. After that Serbia's ally Russia, and Russia's allies France and Britain, were pulled into conflict with Austria-Hungary and its treaty partner, Germany.

But, in an interview with a number of European newspapers, including The Guardian, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen has said the First World War was already an inevitability at this stage.

He told the papers: ‘If you were to simplify it, you could say that the shooting in Sarajevo started the First World War.

‘But if there hadn’t been the shooting in Sarajevo, it would have kicked off three weeks later somewhere else.’

The confrontational nature of the Austro-Hungarian empire along with Russia in Eastern Europe led to the Balkan war in 1912.

This conflict was generally considered to be a ‘prelude’ to the First World War, but Mr Habsburg-Lothringen also said his grandfather, the last Austro-Hungarian emperor, Charles I had only ‘inherited the war’ and should take no blame. Archduke Ferdinand was the uncle of Charles I.

Archduke Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside his wife, Sophie on June 28 1914.

Eventually killed by 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, the couple had earlier that day been attacked by another man who threw a grenade at their car.

Archduke Ferdinand was shot in the neck, while his wife was hit in the abdomen.

The assassination is believed to have started a domino effect which led to the break out of the First World War a month later.

Princip and others wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia.
