Jailed: Adam Curnock was sentenced to seven years behind bars for sexually assaulting a child and secretly filming up girls' skirts at a school 

An education welfare official who installed spy cameras around a primary school so he could secretly film up young girls' skirts has been jailed for seven years.

Adam Curnock, 31, used blue tac to fix a wireless pen camera under sinks or chairs so he could covertly film girls in class or going to the toilet.

The primary after-school club supervisor even filmed himself sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13 in the school's toilets before being sacked last year.

Curnock would arrive at Harwood Meadows Community School in Bolton before classes commenced to set up the device before collecting it at the end of lessons. 

He then downloaded his sick films on to a home PC.

At least 25 unsuspecting children were captured on camera during Curnock's sinister 11-month spying campaign at the school in Greater Manchester.

The mixed school has more than 200 children aged from 3 to 11. 

Police uncovered Curnock's sick library of 57 videos after raiding his home following a tip off - and he claimed it was the 'secrecy of spying that was gratifying' to him.

Further investigation revealed he also had a sick stash of 2,835 other videos and images of children dating back four years but which were not connected to the school.

At Bolton Crown Court, Curnock, from Harwood, pleaded guilty to 33 charges including voyeurism, making indecent images of a child, sexual assault of a child, possessing indecent images of children, possessing prohibited images and possessing extreme pornographic images.

Parents of the affected children wept in the public gallery as Colin Buckle said Curnock, who was qualified in child care, had been working as a welfare assistant and supervisor at an after school club connected to the school.

The investigation began in November last year when police went to his home and seized various computer hardware. 

Curnock was bailed whilst officers checked the PC. But two days later he took an overdose and whilst in hospital confessed to downloading images of children.

Mr Buckle said: 'He went on to confirm in the last 12 months he had been taking a camera into the school and filming the children in the changing rooms and the disabled toilet. He said the camera operated wirelessly and was secreted under a sink with blue tack.

'He recorded images downloaded on to his personal computer. 'The mental health team contacted police. Five videos at that time were discovered which lasted up to 30 minutes mainly with the camera positioned to capture children using the toilet.'

Mr Buckle said one video was filmed in a class room where a girl of six was seen sat above a mobile camera looking up her skirt. It is thought the incident occurred as she was sat on Curnock's knee.

Mr Buckle said: 'This is a video in which the camera is placed in the position where he could see up the skirt and film the children. 

'He confirmed it had been taken by him with the pen camera in his pocket. He denied he had any sexual gratification from the videos and said it was the secrecy of spying that was gratifying. 

'He described how he charged the camera at night and got into school at 7.30am and secure the camera to the toilet.

'When his shift finished in the morning he would go home, down load the images and then go back in the afternoon and repeat the process. 

Sick: Curnock, 31, used blue tac to fix a wireless pen camera under a sink or chair so he could covertly film girls in class or going to the toilet - he would then get collect the device at the end of lessons

'He told police he stopped on occasion but curiosity got the better of him and he carried on. He denied that any of the images had been shared with anyone else.. Police have informed the parents of children involved.

'The defendant said he was able to identify them and that he had a good relations with them and they trusted him. The crown point to an appalling breach of trust.'

The other 52 videos were found later. The images of children not connected to the school included 1076 sexual images of the most serious kind and had been downloaded from the internet.

In mitigation, defence counsel Miss Virginia Hayton said his client's remorse was 'significant and genuine.' 

She added: 'The hope it that children are not affected in future. The hope is that the children weren't aware. The impact will be felt by the parents involved.

'There was not distribution but for his own personal gratification and no evidence to suggest he has shared any of these videos or images with anyone else and it is not financially motivated. The defendant tells me he is extremely sorry and he knows it is not enough.

Long list of charges: At Bolton Crown Court (above), Curnock, from Harwood, pleaded guilty to 33 charges including voyeurism, making indecent images of a child and sexual assault of a child

'He enjoyed and extremely strong relationship with the children and parents who used the facilities of the school. He knows he has lost both their trust. He doesn't expect anyone to forgive him.

'He is aware he has a problem and need help in reducing any further to members of the public and children. He has asked his family not to attend court and he knows he has brought significant shame on his family and himself.. He is very sorry for that.'

Greater Manchester Police's Professional Standards Branch is continuing to investigate why officers failed to react to earlier intelligence on Curnock's actions.

Detective Chief Inspector Sara Wallwork, said: 'These offences are a gross violation of the children's privacy and trust.

'His actions were deliberate and calculated and he has rightly been jailed for these terrible crimes.

'We have worked closely with the local authority and community throughout this investigation, which I know has left many shocked and appalled.'
