For the first time in a decade, astronomers have found dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way - an unprecedented nine in total.

They range in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light-years, and each contain far fewer stars than our galaxy.

Crucially, though, the dwarf galaxies could help test theories of dark matter and perhaps bring us a step closer to detecting the elusive particles.

Astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way. They are the first to be discovered orbiting our galaxy in more than a decade. This image shows the previously known Magellanic Clouds with six of the nine newly discovered dwarf galaxies above the Paranal Observatory in Chile

The discovery was made by a team of astronomers at the University of Cambridge using data from the Dark Energy Survey, a five-year project to photograph the southern sky in extreme detail.

The nine dwarf galaxies were spotted in the night sky in the southern hemisphere, near the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud, which are the largest dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way's orbit.

Astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy, making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light-years wide.

This is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy, which the astronomers think is now actually part of it, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies. 

The team of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York studied the Monoceros Ring, which is a long ring-like filament of stars that ‘wraps’ around our galaxy three times. 

‘The discovery of so many satellites in such a small area of the sky was completely unexpected,' said Dr Sergey Koposov of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, the study’s lead author. 

‘I could not believe my eyes.’

The newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the Milky Way, and a million times less massive.

This makes them incredibly difficult to find, even in our galactic neighbourhood.

Dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe, and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas the Milky Way has around 200 billion.

Importantly, though, they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter.

This means they should be useful to test cosmological theories of dark matter, which makes up 25 per cent of all matter in the universe but is yet to be detected.

‘Dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter,’ said Dr Vasily Belokurov of the Institute of Astronomy, one of the study’s co-authors.

‘We need to find them to determine whether our cosmological picture makes sense. Finding such a large group of satellites near the Magellanic Clouds was surprising, though, as earlier surveys of the southern sky found very little, so we were not expecting to stumble on such treasure.’

These dwarf galaxies are the first to be discovered after dozens were found in 2005 and 2006. The closest of the newly discovered dwarf galaxies is being torn apart by the Milky Way, while the most distant is about to start being pulled in towards us.

When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery.

If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing.

From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force.

Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 25 per cent of the matter in the known universe.

Their origins remain a bit of a mystery, though; they may have once orbited the Magellanic Clouds until they were thrown out.

However, it should be noted that while three of the objects are definitely dwarf galaxies, some of the other six may actually be globular clusters. These are spherical collections of stars that are not thought to be held together by dark matter.

Another implication of the discovery is that two star-forming clusters found below the Milky Way, announced last month, may actually have an extragalactic origin.

Known as Camargo 438 and 439, the two clusters were found 16,000 light-years below the flattened disk of the Milky Way.

Previously, it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds (GMC) located in the inner part of the galactic disc.

The two clusters were thought to have been pushed out of the galactic disk by a ‘superwind’ caused by supernovae.

But Dr Denilso Camargo of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porte Alegre, Brazil - who led the study - told MailOnline that the discovery by the Cambridge scientists now suggests they might have come from beyond our own galaxy before being captured.

‘This work supports the idea that Camargo 438 and Camargo 439 have an extragalactic origin,’ he said.

But they are thought to be 99% dark matter - which could help confirm theories of its presence in the cosmos
