Vote No: Alastair Darling, pictured at the 'Better Together' campaign launch today in Scotland, is leading the fight to keep the Union

A vote for independence is like buying Scotland's children a one-way ticket to uncertainty, Alastair Darling claimed as he launched the pro-Union campaign today.

Scotland 'has a better future' if the United Kingdom is not broken up, the former Labour Chancellor said as he began the fight to block it.

The Scottish will probably go to the polls in 2014 to decide whether the country should leave the UK.

'The choice we make will be irrevocable,' Mr Darling told campaigners this morning at Edinburgh Napier University's egg-shaped lecture hall in 
Craiglockhart.

'If we decide to leave the United Kingdom there is no way back. It is
like asking us to buy a one-way ticket to send our children to a deeply
uncertain destination.'

The 'Better Together' campaign he leads has brought in big-hitting media strategists Blue State Digital, which helped bring US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande to power.

They will also distribute half a million leaflets promoting the social union between the two nations.

The leaflets highlight the one in five workers employed by English firms in Scotland, as well as those working for the UK Government in places such as the Department for International Development offices in East Kilbride.

Another points to the 800,000 Scots who live and work in England and Wales 'without the need for papers or passports'.

Mr Darling, echoing the message of the campaign's advertising campaign, argued that Scotland can have the best of both worlds without breaking the Union.

'A strong Scottish Parliament and a key role in a strong and secure United Kingdom,' he said.

'I believe we can cement Scotland's place in the United Kingdom once and
for all and then get on with building the Scotland we want and 
deserve.'

The rival campaign to break up the UK was launched a month ago by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond where he urged one million Scots to sign up to a ‘declaration of independence’.

Mr Darling's speech was followed by a 
film showing Scots explaining why they are comfortable being patriotic 
while keeping the country in the UK.

Students, pensioners and workers all gave their views that it can be positive to vote No in the ballot.

They
described family and historic ties, saying Scotland is stronger as part
of a wider Union including England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

YES: Alex Salmond launched his YES campaign last month, with celebrity supporters including actors Alan Cumming and Brian Cox

It was in contrast to the celebrity-endorsed launch of the Yes Scotland campaign which hopes to secure independence in 2014.

Former Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie, introducing the 'real people', including a teacher from Inverness, a retired soldier, a young farmer from the Scottish Borders and an Englishman who said he is happy to make Scotland his adopted home.

Miss Goldie was joined on stage by Kezia Dugdale, a Labour MSP, who spoke to shipbuilders committed to a No vote.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie closed the campaign launch with a call to everyone who wishes Scotland to remain in the UK.

People should ask themselves every day how they can play a part in beating the 'passionate' pro-independence movement, he said.

'We'll take nothing for granted. In the campaign to keep our family together, we will work for every single vote,' he said.

Celebrity backing: Actor Alan Cumming endorsed the independence campaign at the launch

The rabble-rousing campaign to overturn the 305-year-old Act of Union is led by the Scottish Nationalists and backed by the Scottish Socialists and Greens.

But Mr Salmond's launch was overshadowed by blunders when it emerged that three of the celebrities backing the ‘yes’ campaign may not be allowed to vote in an independence referendum.

The SNP’s star backer, the Bahamas-based actor Sir Sean Connery, disappointed campaigners by failing to show up, sending just a message of support.

GoldenEye actor Alan Cumming and Braveheart star Brian Cox were instead left to take to the stage, yet neither of the Hollywood idols lives in Scotland.

At the launch of the campaign in an Edinburgh cinema, Mr Salmond said: ‘We unite behind a declaration of self-evident truth.

‘The people who live in Scotland are best placed to make the decisions that affect Scotland.

'We want a Scotland that’s greener, that’s fairer and more prosperous.

'We realise that the power of an independent Scotland is necessary to achieve these great ends.'

Meanwhile it was revealed the majority of English and Welsh people want to save the Union and prevent Scotland becoming independent.

Only one in three asked by pollsters said they would be happy if their northern neighbours left the United Kingdom.

A survey by The Independent asked whether Scotland should be separate and independent, and two out of three said no.

Its result flies in the face of claims that most English and Welsh would be happy not to 'subsidise' Scotland, as some critics have claimed happens.

ComRes said when asked if they agreed Scotland should be separate from the rest of the UK and become independent, 28 per cent agreed, 57 per cent disagreed and 15 per cent didn't know.
