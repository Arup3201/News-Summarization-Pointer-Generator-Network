America's rich are even more well off that we originally thought, a new study has found.

The top 1 percent of U.S. earners were previously estimated to control 30 per cent of the country's wealth but it seems that number could be closer to 37 per cent.

A new working paper from European Central Bank senior economist Philip Vermeulen claims 30 percent is a lowball estimate of the net worth of the nation's elite because wealthier households are less likely to respond to surveys about their assets than lower-income families.

Vermeulen analyzed data from Forbes' billionaires lists to estimate the share of the 1 percent is in fact between 35 percent and 37 percent.

'Our knowledge of the wealth distribution is less than perfect,' Vermeulen writes in the paper.

'Our results clearly indicate that survey wealthy estimates are very likely to underestimate wealth at the top.'

The Survey
 of Consumer Ô¨Ånances is the best source of information on wealth 
distribution, asking questions about all asset holdings and debts of the
 household.

However,
 a large chunk of the wealthy sample families don't respond, or only 
respond in part, because they're away, too busy, or they refuse to 
reveal sensitive information for example.

Vermeulenfound that using the Forbe's billionaires list gave him a better idea of the jaw-dropping wealth in each country, and in turn account for that missing data.

He said getting the wealth break down of the U.S. correct helps both economic researchers and policy makers as it guides fiscal policy.

The paper found the U.S. was not alone in underestimating how rich its rich are.

Other countries also downplayed the assets of their 1 percent, with many European nations having a significant gap between the richest household recorded by their equivalent survey and the poorest billionaire on the Forbes list.

Vermeulen 's research may also suggest that the wealth controlled by the richest 5 percent in America, which was always thought to be a huge 60 percent, may also be more.

The men and women on the Forbes' billionaires list have an aggregate wealth of $6.7 trillion.

This is because they are away, too busy or hesitant to answer questions honestly about their wealth
