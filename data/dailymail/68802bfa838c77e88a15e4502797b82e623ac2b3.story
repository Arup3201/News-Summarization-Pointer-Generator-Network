A paddle boarder risked his life - and thousands of pounds - by edging within feet of at least two huge humpback whales.

Photographer Jodi Frediani captured the dramatic encounter while she was whale watching in Monterey Bay, California. 

The man was seen repeatedly moving his paddle board towards the giant mammals, which can weigh up to 36 tonnes.

Too close for comfort: The man was also risking a fine of more than £6,500 by approaching the mammals in Monterey Bay, California

As well as putting his own life in danger, he was risking more than £6,500  because getting too close to the whales in the wild carries a massive fine.

The paddle boarder waited to see where the whales - which can measure up to 16 metres - were feeding and then tried to approach them on 'multiple' occasions. 

Huge numbers of the creatures have come close to the shore to feed on the summer anchovy crop giving whale watchers the chance to see them up close.

With its food source near the surface, wildlife enthusiasts have been able to watch incredible surface lunges that allow the whales to scoop up large numbers of fish.

Jodi said: 'This paddle boarder deliberately approached the whales multiple times but this can break the National Marine Fisheries Service guidelines.

'Fortunately for him, none of the whales got irritated enough to lash out with a large tail throw, something we saw them do to a sailboat which sailed right through a group of feeding whales.

'He could have been knocked off his board or seriously hurt if the whales were to come up where he was standing or do a tail lob.

'They wouldn't deliberately attempt to hurt a person but they can weigh a huge amount.

'However I've been out to see them several times since this incident and people have been far more respectful.

'They've had amazing encounters with the whales approaching them.

'This year has been an exceptionally wonderful and rare occurrence to have so many humpback whales surface lunge-feeding on anchovies so close to shore. Pure magic.'
