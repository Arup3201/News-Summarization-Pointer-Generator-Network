The father of Bowe Bergdahl is seen here for the first time without the long beard and ponytail he grew while his son was held by the Taliban for five years before his controversial release.

Bob Bergdahl, 55, raised a few eyebrows when he stood next to President Obama during his announcement of Bergdahl's release at a White House press conference at the end of May.

But today – more than six weeks after his son's release - Bob was clean-shaven as he left a bike repair shop where he works in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho.

Clean shaven: Bob Bergdahl looks strikingly similar to his son without the long beard and ponytail he has appeared in public with before

'Estrangement': His son Bowe has not spoken to his parents in the six weeks that he has been free

In these exclusive photos Bob worked on a bike outside the repair shop and yesterday was picked up by wife Jani and donned sunglasses and a baseball cap.

But Bob's new look can't mask an apparent family rift. Astonishingly, it emerged that Bergdahl has refused to speak with his parents since he was released from captivity in Pakistan six weeks ago. And today the POW's lawyer refused to say whether he had any plans to return to his hometown.

An army official reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that the sergeant has refused to see his parents in person or even speak to them on the phone, suggesting 'a deeper estrangement between the soldier and his parents than the military understood when he was released'.

The precise cause of the estrangement isn't known, but if true it must come as a bitter blow to Bob who dedicated his life to bringing Bowe home.

Bob had been growing the facial hair ever since his son was 
kidnapped by Taliban warlords in Afghanistan in 2009.

Bob
 – who dedicated his life to finding Bowe – vowed not to shave until his
 son returned home safely and the beard became a symbol of his quest.

Sgt Bergdahl had been held captive by the Haqqani Network for five years before he was released to U.S. Special Forces in May as part of a prisoner swap.

Under that deal, Bergdahl was set free in exchange for the release of five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

The White House quickly hailed Bergdahl's release as a victory but the matter soon became embroiled in controversy as lawmakers complained they weren't given sufficient notice of the planned swap and warned of national security risks of releasing leading Taliban figures.

To add to the fallout several former members of Bergdahl's platoon branded him a deserter and a traitor and said other soldiers had given their lives trying to rescue them.

Deserter? Bergdahl now faces an Army investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive

Bergdahl now faces a military investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive.

Bergdhal returned to active duty on Monday after finishing an intensive debriefing and therapy program at a military hospital in San Antonio, Texas.

Bob, a former UPS driver, has worked tirelessly advocating for his son over the past five years while he was held by the Taliban.

He learned the Pashto language, read in to the history of the Taliban and grew his beard in order to better communicate with them.

'Bowe has been gone so long, it’s going to be very difficult to come back,' he warned a few days after his son’s release. 'If he comes up too fast, it could kill him.'

It was widely assumed that they would reunite after he returned to the United States and Bergdahl would be welcomed home to Hailey amid fanfare and open arms. 

Bergdahl returned to a 'desk job' at Fort Sam Houston this week and continues to live in army barracks in Texas.

He thanked Obama for saving his life this week and his newly-appointed military justice lawyer Eugene Fidell insisted overnight the former POW is 'proud' to be back in uniform.

'Sergeant Bergdahl is deeply grateful to President Obama for saving his life,' Fidell, a Yale Law School professor who is working pro bono, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

Fidell also appeared on the Today show on Thursday to defend his client, insisting that he was proud to be serving the U.S., despite earlier correspondence that showed him slating his nation.

'I believe he is [proud],' Fidell said. 'He's back to duty.'

Fidell met personally with Bergdahl last
 week at the base. Bergdahl also has an Army lawyer representing him and
 the two lawyers will work together.

Fidell said he has met with the 
sergeant and hopes to ‘facilitate’ the next chapter of his life.

'We
 had extensive conversations last week,' he told MailOnline. 'The chemistry between
 us is good and I enjoyed being with him, I like him based on what I’ve 
seen.

'I’m
 happy to be representing him and I and the other lawyers I am going to 
be working with are going to give him our best efforts.

'I
 hope we can facilitate the transition to the next chapter of his life. 
He’s got to move in to the next chapter and pursue his education and put
 Afghanistan behind him.

'He
 wants to pursue an education and be normal, another citizen in the 
crowd.

'He doesn’t know what course he wants to do yet but that’s his 
plan. Bowe is just really looking forward to putting this behind him.'

Fidell told MailOnline that he doesn’t know whether Bergdahl intends to return to his 
hometown of Hailey, Idaho and won’t be drawn on his relationship with 
his parents and why it appears he hasn’t spoken to them yet.

Fidell said Major General Kenneth Dahl, who is heading the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance from his outpost in Afghanistan, had not yet interviewed his client.

He said he didn't expect Dahl to have any substantive interviews with Bergdahl for a couple of weeks. Bergdahl has not been charged with any crimes.

In a 
statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase
 of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and 
is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San 
Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).

'He
 will now return to regular duty within the command where he can 
contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is 
still ongoing.'

Fox
 reported that Bergdahl may also receive $350,000 from the US government
 without paying taxes: $200,000 would be for wages earned during his 
captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a POW.

Mind
 games: This photo of Bergdahl smiling with Taliban Commander Badruddin 
Haqqani was posted on Twitter recently and raised more questions about 
his time in captivity

When he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, Obama said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health.

But his former comrades have insisted he abandoned his post - putting others in danger - and last week, on a Twitter account associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, a user said Bergdahl had been treated with kindness by his captors.

MailOnline yesterday approached Bob in Hailey but he refused to comment.

He
 appeared down and gloomy and hid in the back of the business where he 
works repairing bikes.

Close friend Chip, 54, 
says Bob has had enough of the media attention and the controversy that 
has surrounded his family and 'isn't interested' in discussing his son.

‘He’s not interested, he thinks it’s a fiasco,’ said Chip.
