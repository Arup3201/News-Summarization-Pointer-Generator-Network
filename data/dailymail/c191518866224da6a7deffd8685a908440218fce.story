Boxing legend Mike Tyson has caused some raised eyebrows following a bizarre rambling television appearance.

Tyson hit the stage at this year's Soul Train Awards, currently airing on BET, to promote his new Adult Swim show cartoon, the Mike Tyson Mysteries, but the lack of a script seemed to throw him off kilter. 

In the one-minute clip he is seen attempting to plug his new show, forgetting where to stand, asking if he'd 'done it right' and shouting out Floyd Mayweather before walking off stage.

Twitter users took to the social media site as the show aired last night to express their bafflement following Tyson's appearance, which appeared to be completely unscripted.

Even more bizarrely the show was pre-recorded on November 7, but producers decided to keep the toe-curling segment in its entirety when it went out last night.

Tyson walked out on stage wearing a black leather jacket and said: 'Hey hey! You see that? Mike Tyson Mysteries, 10.30 Monday night.

'Watch it or else. Nah,I'm just kidding. Watch it anyway though.'

The crowd applauded throughout and laughed when he walked across the stage said: 'Missed my spot. I'm meant to be right here.'

He appeared to lose his train of thought and said: 'Um. Alright, okay.

'Hey champ, how you doing? Floyd Mayweather everybody, best fighter in the world.

He then said: 'Did I do it right? Oh, excuse me,' before walking off stage.

Twitter users branded the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world's rambling appearance 'embarrassing'.

One Twitter user said: 'I have no idea what just happened. None.'

Another said: 'Mike Tyson embarrassed himself at The Soul Train Awards.'

One tweeted: 'Mike Tyson's appearance was pointless just now.'

Another user said: 'I believe this is the rehearsal episode for the Soul Train awards... surely this is not the real thing! Mike Tyson?' 

Meanwhile, Essence magazine tweeted: 'What just happened with Mike Tyson? #SoulTrainAwards'.

Twitter users branded Tyson's rambling appearance at the Soul Train Awards as  'embarrassing'

Tyson's new cartoon show - in which he solves Scooby Doo-style crimes alongside an alcoholic talking pigeon and a ghost - has premiered to some early harsh reviews.

The Cartoon Network's Adult Swim show, called Mike Tyson's Mysteries, features Tyson voicing himself alongside a talking pigeon, the Ghost of the Marquess of Queensbury and his adopted daughter Yung Hee.

Although it was well received when it premiered at this July's Comic-Con event in San Diego, early reviews have labelled it bizarre, insane and anarchic.
