It was a strange feeling at the end of the game. The late tries conceded by Scotland took the slight gloss off what was a great night for Scottish rugby. I had to remind myself that Scotland had just beaten a major team scoring five tries and 41 points.

If you had offered me that before the game, I would have snapped your hand off but what the ending did was keep everyone’s feet firmly on the ground.

It was a near perfect performance for the first 50 minutes. Not in execution, because there were some mistakes made, but in the way the team set out to play the game.

Despite winning the game, Scotland's victory was stained by conceding late tries against Argentina

Vern Cotter had given the players the licence to play and that is exactly what they did. There was a vibrancy about the attack and defence that was so evident and every component of their game functioned very well.

There was a lot of confidence in the team before the game, mainly due to the number of Glasgow Warriors players on show and the great start to the season they have had. But it was very obvious that this confidence was spreading to others as Ross Ford and Greig Laidlaw had their best games for Scotland for a long while.

In the past year, the Scottish lineout had struggled and part of that was down to Ford’s throwing in with this issue affecting the rest of his game. On Saturday, his throwing in was flawless and his ability to make ground with ball-in-hand were key to the momentum of Scotland’s performance.

It was Laidlaw, though, who brought the spark to the team as he added pace and tempo to the game as well as making good decisions. His breaks that created the tries for Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg were first class and highlighted the sharpness of thought and foot as well as great skill in making the scoring pass.

The new boys in the team did well. Adam Ashe looks more an international player every time I see him, Finn Russell controlled the game with a composure that belied his years and inexperience, Blair Cowan did well in the tackle area and Rob Harley put in a huge effort as usual. Mark Bennett, on his debut, had a difficult start but settled quickly and will be wiser as a result.

He should have had a try on his first cap as Jonny Gray chose to dummy rather than pass to Bennett who was in under the posts. Both players moved on as if nothing had happened which is exactly the right reaction to make.

It was some night for the Gray brothers with both scoring but, more importantly, playing so well. They complement each other with Jonny doing a lot of the hard graft and Richie more comfortable in the wider channels. It is incredible to think that, before Grant Gilchrist’s injury, one of these two was not playing. That highlights the strength that Scotland has in the second row.

What really impressed me was how ruthless Scotland were in taking their chances. Apart from when Jonny Gray should have passed to Bennett, every time Scotland got in to the Argentina 22, they scored. Six chances and five tries is very clinical indeed and so different to what we are used to see from Scotland.

How many times have we had gone through the phases and never looked like scoring? This team has real cutting edge and a desire to win quick ball and make line breaks. It is also a team that prides itself on its defence so the late concession of three tries will give them something to work on this week in training.

It was a hugely positive performance and result on Saturday and one that continues the feel-good factor in Scottish rugby. It continued the momentum Glasgow had started and sets us all up for the ultimate test on Saturday, to play the mighty All Blacks. I cannot wait.
