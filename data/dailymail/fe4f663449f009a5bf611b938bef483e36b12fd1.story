Patients lying in their hospital beds are charged 10 times more to watch 'free' TV programmes than prisoners incarcerated in their cells, it has emerged. 

To use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at Southport Hospital, patients are charged £10 every 24 hours.

Meanwhile inmates at nearby Maghull's HMP Kennet pay just £1 a week to have a TV in their cell.

The stark disparity has prompted patients and their families to hit out at the costs, saying they add a huge expense to a stay in hospital. 

To use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at Southport Hospital, patients are charged £10 every 24 hours. That is 10 times more than prisoners are required to spend to watch the same 'free' TV programmes. Relatives have branded the disparity 'shocking and unfair' (file picture)

Mike Gillett, whose relative was a patient at Southport Hospital after breaking her leg, said the family paid £140 over the course of a two-week stay.

He said: 'To charge £10 is just unfair because you have nothing better to do but to watch TV while you are in hospital. 

'What else are you supposed to do?

'But to find out that people in prisons pay just £1 just beggar's belief.

'Hard working tax payers are forking out £10 per day to watch TV from their hospital bed when they have nothing better to do, but criminals pay a small fraction of the same amount - when they're supposed to be locked up.

'It just doesn't seem fair. I understand they have costs to meet but I would be shocked if it costs as much as £10 a day.

'Some patients on the ward were complaining that they only watch one soap a day, and it still costs them the same amount as if they were watching 24 hours of TV.'

Hospedia provides bedside TV services in NHS hospitals across the country.

Patients are all charged similar amounts for access to TV, phone and internet services, across the UK.

A spokesperson for the company defended the charges to patients, saying it also paid for installation costs.

They said: 'Hospedia provides bedside media to both Southport and Ormskirk hospitals across the majority of their wards.

'We have 323 TVs installed at Southport and 134 at Ormskirk. 

'Private providers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds installing and operating these systems so that the NHS did not have to pay for them from public funds.

'If a patient is staying in hospital for one day only, we have a number of options for them to purchase but it is important to note that there are many longer term packages providing a wide range of further options too.

'We give very serious consideration to the packages we offer and customer feedback has been the driving force in selecting the durations and options we currently have available.'

A spokesman for Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust said: 'We will discuss the issues raised with Hospedia.'
