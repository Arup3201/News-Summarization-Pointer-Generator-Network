The world's most notorious computer hacker turned against his comrades because he did not want to go to prison and leave behind his two children, it has been revealed.

Top members of hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec have been arrested across two continents after their leader, 28-year-old Hector Xavier Monsegur, turned them in.

In a startling show of betrayal towards his fellow hackers, the father-of-two spent the last six months working as an FBI informant, leading authorities to the five people who have now been charged in court papers in New York.

Monsegur, who has been described as the ringleader of LulzSec, and an 'influential member' of Anonymous, pleaded guilty to a dozen hacking-related charges last summer - crimes which carry a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months in prison.

But, rather than face a lengthy jail sentence and not see his two children, the unemployed father agreed to cooperate with the FBI, and, ever since his arrest, has reportedly been working with them to bring down the groups' top hackers.

The suspects include four LulzSec members - two men from Great Britain and two from Ireland - and one member of Anonymous - an American named Jeremy Hammond from 
Chicago.

'This is devastating to the organization,' an FBI official told Fox News. 'We’re chopping off the head of LulzSec.'

The hackers have claimed to be 
responsible for a number of attacks on large companies, law enforcement 
and government agencies, including the CIA, FBI and Sony.

They are believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies.

Fox News reported that FBI agents broke down Monsegur, who works under the alias of Sabu, by using his children against him.

‘It was because of his kids,’ one of the
two arresting agents told the news channel. ‘He’d do anything for his kids. He 
didn’t want to go away to prison and leave them. That’s how we got him.’

Monsegur had been living in New York's Lower East Side when he was seized by authorities because of his own carelessness. They found his address after he logged into a chatroom without masking his IP - the address which shows a user's whereabouts.

Authorities launched surveillance and watched him for weeks - but were forced to move when a rival hacker revealed Monsegur's identity online.

Anonymous is the umbrella term used to represent an internet subculture – a collection of online individuals, or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom of speech on the internet.

They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers.

Although it is not formerly 
affiliated with it, the group has connections with the lesser-known 
hacking group LulzSec.

LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, is an offshoot of Anonymous and some members have been parts of both collectives .

LulzSec is an elite
computer hacker group that has claimed responsibility for several 
high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks.

Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline.

They also attacked Fox.com, leaking 
the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour 
website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was 
still living and in New Zealand.

The group aims to cause mayhem as well as manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems.

Fearing he would destroy his hard 
drives - and thus evidence needed to prove his guilt - they went to 
arrest him in June last year. 

Monsegur initially tried to deny he was the man the FBI were after.

‘It’s not me, you got the wrong guy,’
he allegedly said, according to sources who witnessed the interaction. 
‘I don’t have a computer.’

At this point, one of the FBI agents 
threatened to have the father locked up, which is when he caved in and 
agreed to cooperate with them.

He pleaded guilty to 12 counts of hacking
charges on August 15 but went on living in the Manhattan unit he shared with his children, supporting them and five brothers and a sister.

His records were unsealed today, charging him with conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, among other charges.

The 27-page indictment describes him as an 
'influential member of three hacking organizations — Anonymous, Internet
Feds and Lulz Security — that were responsible for multiple cyber 
attacks on the computer systems of various businesses and governments in
the United States and throughout the world'.

They claim he acted as a 'rooter', a computer hacker who identified vulnerabilities in computer systems.

As part of Anonymous, court
papers claim he took part cyber attacks from December 2010 until last 
June, including attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, and further 
attacks on government computers in Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and 
Zimbabwe.

As part of Internet Feds, he is alleged to have participated in attacks against businesses including HBGary Inc., a private security firm and Fox Broadcasting Co.

And he is accused of forming LulzSec last May with other hackers, who then attacked Sony, PBS and the United States Senate, among others.

Monsegur was free on $50,000 bail.

Also charged in court papers with 
conspiracy to commit computer hacking were Ryan Ackroyd and Jake Davis 
from Great Britain, Darren Martyn and Donncha O’Cearrbhail of 
Ireland, and an American named Jeremy Hammond from Chicago.

Davis, who already faces a number of charges in the UK relating to alleged hacking by LulzSec, and Ackroyd, 23, were charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy. Each count of computer hacking conspiracy carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail.

It is understood that Scotland Yard is also running parallel inquiries into Ackroyd and Davis’ alleged activities within LulzSec. It has been reported that it is unlikely anyone would be extradited before the UK trials had concluded.

Another English teenager Ryan Cleary, 
was arrested by British law enforcement in June last year and was charged with being 
linked to the group.

The arrested member of Anonymous, Jeremy Hammond from Chicago, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy, one count 
of computer hacking, and one count of conspiracy to commit access device
fraud.

He
reportedly caused the hacking of Stratfor Security Intelligence, which 
led to the leak of 200GB worth of emails then published on Wikileaks.

Fox sources said Hammond will be charged in a separate indictment.

Darren Martyn, 25, of Galway, Ireland, has been charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy, while Donncha O'Cearrbhail, 19, of Birr, Ireland, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy and one charge of unlawfully intercepted wire communication, which carries a sentence of up to five years.

The charge sheets detail how central Monsegur was in building the FBI's case against those arrested. According to the indictment written by the investigating FBI officer, 'CW' or Sabu, communicated with other hackers 'acting under the direction of the FBI'.

From information taken from internet chat logs 'recorded by the FBI with the CW's consent', one document relating to O’Cearrbhail reveals how he recorded a conference call between the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency and the FBI. The file was received by Monsegur and verified by the FBI.

The FBI was then able to refer to another conversation between the pair where O’Cearrbhail, who was writing under several names, revealed his identity. O’Cearrbhail faces up to 15 years in prison if he is extradited and convicted.

Fox claims Monsegur has been feeding authorities information about LulzSec ever since his arrest, bringing them down from the 
inside.

Yet he has continued to be a public face
for the movement, tweeting to his followers on Monday: 'The federal 
government is run by a bunch of f****** cowards. Don't give in to these 
people. Fight back. Stay strong.'

In August, 2011, it came to light 
that Anonymous had hacked into 70 law enforcement websites, mostly local
sheriffs’ websites in Missouri.

The hacks had occurred four weeks 
before they were discovered. Using information passed on by Monsegur, the FBI 
was able to work with the server company to mitigate the damage, Fox 
claims.

The FBI then alerted 300 government, 
financial and corporate entities around the world to potential 
vulnerabilities in their computer systems.

Stories
have also emerged about Sabu's far-reaching power. When the CIA found 
itself under siege from LulzSec hackers, Sabu, working for the 
government, told them to stop, and they did.

'He's a rockstar,' a New York-based 
hacker told Fox. 'All the girls, you buy them a drink, but all they want
to talk about is Sabu, Sabu, Sabu.'

Barrett Brown, a former journalist 
who became closely associated with Anonymous, said Sabu's betrayal would
have a serious effect on the group.

'He was an admired Anon,' he told AP. 'He's been a leader. People came to him with information. God knows what else he told them.'
