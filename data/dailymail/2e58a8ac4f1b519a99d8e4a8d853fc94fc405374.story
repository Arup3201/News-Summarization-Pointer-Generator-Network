A vicar had to be shocked back to life 22 times after he had a heart attack while delivering a Sunday sermon.

The Rev Leonard Payne was telling how Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law when he collapsed at the St Nicholas Church in Wrentham, Suffolk, on February 8.

The 66-year-old said he started to find breathing difficult and was taken home by a colleague. 

He said: 'I felt a gripping pain on the heart and pain in my arm.

'The first responder was very fast in arriving and then the paramedics and ambulance came. 

'They me took by ambulance to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. 

'I had to be shocked 22 times. I'm very lucky to be here. 

'I went about four or five times in the ambulance.'

Mr Payne had stents put into his arteries in hospital and is now recovering at his rectory home. He hopes to  return to work in time for Easter.

He said: 'I'm getting out for exercise every day.

'I'm not yet officially back to work but I shall be on Easter Sunday, the most important day of the year.'

Mr Payne said residents had been 'wonderful', regularly visiting him and offering him huge support.

He also discovered the church had been awarded a £69,100 grant to help repair its crumbling roof - and might consider bringing forward retirement after 17 years as the local rector.

Mr Payne was going to retire in June 2016 as he felt he needed the extra time to leave the church in a good state of repair for his successor.

But he said: 'This week I've learnt that we've secured the grant from a Government fund for urgent church roof repairs so I can think about retiring on New Year's Eve instead.'
