It may be the same pale shade of peach as the confusing Philip Treacy hat she wore to her cousin's wedding last year.

But the elegant, two-tone wool-crepe Roskanda Ilincic dress Princess Beatrice sported to the Britain Creates party in London last night hit all the notes her Royal Wedding headgear missed.

And by teaming the sophisticated long-sleeved frock - which sells for £885 on Net-A-Porter - with a pair of Nicholas Kirkwood's blue pattered platform heels and a pink sparkly clutch by Anya Hindmarch, Beatrice went all-out in supporting homegrown British designers.

Pretty as a peach: Princess Beatrice and singer Bo Bruce at the Britain Creates gala

Attending last night's party without her partner-in-crime Princess Eugenie, Beatrice, 23, wasted no time in buddying-up with Voice finalist Bo Bruce, who was wearing a similarly hued gown.

The Wiltshire singer is more than familiar with the young royal's aristocratic social circle since her father is David Brudenell-Bruce, Earl of Cardigan.

The Britain Creates 2012: Fashion & Art Collusion VIP Gala was held at the Old Selfridges Hotel in London.

Also in attendance were Australian 
actress Holly Valance; The Script's Danny O'Donoghue, speculated to be 
dating Bo; Florence (+ The Machine) Welch, looking dramatic in a 
floor-length black dress by Julien Macdonald; TV chef Gizzi Erskine; Jo Wood and daughter Leah; dapper designer Matthew Williamson and handbag queen Anya Hidmarch who was no doubt thrilled to see Beatrice enjoying her sparkly pink clutch.

By wearing Hindmarch, Kirkwood and Ilincic - a favourite with the Duchess of Cambridge, Michelle Obama, Tilda Swinton, Samantha Cameron, Emma Stone and Colleen Rooney - Princess Beatrice made a statement about her fondness for British fashion.

Ilincic - who was born in Serbia but moved to London in 1999 to study fashion at Central St Martins - is known for her elegant, sophisticated and refined clothes.

Her dresses cost upwards of £500 and are stocked in Harvey Nichols.
