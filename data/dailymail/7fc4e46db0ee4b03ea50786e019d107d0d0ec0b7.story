Stephen Fry, who is one of Britain's most followed Twitter users, has quit the social networking site

Stephen Fry,  who is one of Britain's most followed Twitter users, has  quit the social networking site over safety fears.

In a cryptic final tweet to his 7.8million followers, the actor and TV presenter said he would be leaving Twitter until December - but did not reveal why.

He said that he is filming 'in a place whence I've been advised it is safest not to tweet'.

Fry's tweet, published earlier today, prompted speculation from some fans that he is filming for Star Wars Episode VII, which is scheduled for release on December 18.

Another speculated: 'You're either filming in Parliament or a football club dressing room then. Good luck, see you in December'.

In the tweet, Fry said: 'Closing down on Twitter while filming.

'In a place whence I've been advised it is safest not to tweet. See you December. Here goes...' 

He also updated his Twitter bio to say: 'Away November: sadly not taking new tweet requests all month.' 

Fry, 57, who presents the quiz show QI, has built a huge following on Twitter since he joined in September 2008.

He is considered part of the Twitterati and is often named in lists of the most influential people on the site.

But it's not the first time Fry has taken a hiatus from the website. 

In 2009, Fry famously threatened to leave Twitter for good because he felt there was 'too much aggression and unkindness around'.

He also took temporary respite from the site for just a few hours following the publication of revelations in his memoir, More Fool Me, in September.

Some of the revelations which hit the headlines included the admission he had taken cocaine while in several highly-respected institutions, including in Buckingham Palace and the House of Lords.

Talking about his 15-year addiction, he wrote: ‘I take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly, to the owners, managers or representatives of the noble and ignoble premises and to the hundreds of private homes, offices, car dashboards, tables, mantelpieces and available polished surfaces that could so easily have been added to this list of shame.

‘You may wish to have me struck off, banned, black balled or in any other way punished for past crimes; surely now is the time to reach for the phone, the police or the club secretary.’

Fry is famously outspoken and uses his Twitter profile to express some of his views. 

He faced a furious backlash in July after attacking the country’s most high-profile police inquiry into historic sex abuse, Operation Yewtree, while hosting a Labour fundraiser. 

He urged guests, who included Labour leader Ed Miliband, to remember that ‘people are innocent until proven guilty’ and singled out former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for criticism.

Last year he offended Russia by claiming the 2014 Winter Olympics should be moved from Sochi because President Putin ‘is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews’ before the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

In 2010, he offended feminists and many women by saying they don’t like sex. And the year before that he defended the MPs’ expenses scandal saying it was ‘not important’.
