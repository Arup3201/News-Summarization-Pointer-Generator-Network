A father who was knocked out at work woke up to find his memory had been wiped - and he couldn't even recognise his own daughter.

Luke Shinnie, 35, didn't know who his toddler, Zoe, or his fiancee, Sarah Burrows, were when he first came round.

Devastated Miss Burrows feared he would never remember his family again. But after months of hard work and help from medics, Luke has now managed to piece together his long-term memory.

And despite still suffering from some short-term memory loss, he now manages his condition by keeping a diary, where he writes down everything he does each day.

Mr Shinnie, from Worcester, was seriously injured when heavy machinery fell on him at work in June 2012.

He said: 'The last thing I remember is being in a meeting, and after that the next I knew I was lying in the hospital.'

Miss Burrows rushed to see him at the hospital but was horrified when he didn't recognise her or their daughter, who is now two years old.

She said: 'At first I was so scared that he would never remember us. It's one thing not to recognise me but the thought of him not remembering Zoe was heartbreaking.

'I had to show him pictures of him 
with myself and Zoe and told him stories of things he had done in the 
days and weeks leading up to the accident to try and jog his memory.

Miss Burrows feared her fiance would never recover from the memory loss, but he has battled back using a diary to remember his daily actions

'I told him about playing with Zoe in the house and what he had been doing at work. I don't know what triggered his recollection of us but I can't describe how relieved I was and still am.'

Mr Shinnie was released from 
Worcestershire Royal Hospital but had to return two days later after
suffering extreme dizziness and vomiting.

Post Concussion Syndrome (PCS) affects around half of people who suffer concussion after a head injury.

It can take many forms, of which memory loss or amnesia is just one.

The exact cause is not agreed upon but many experts think it is a result of the brain's chemical balance changing after the initial injury.

Doctors classify memories as immediate, such as sounds, short-term, such as telephone numbers and permanent, such as childhood recollections.

Usually, the longer-term memories return first because they are more 'consolidated' by being re-used by the brain.

There is no specific treatment for PCS, although sufferers are usually given medication for migraines and anti-depressants to help control psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety.

Most cases of PCS are resolved within three to six months and only one in 10 people will still have symptoms after a year, according to the NHS.

As a result of the trauma he suffered, symptoms of which included mood swings, depression and short-term memory loss, the couple nearly broke up.

Happily, they have stuck together and are expecting their second child in three weeks' time.

Miss Burrows, 31, a deputy supermarket manager, said: 'When I first turned up at the hospital he didn't even recognise me at all - that was horrible.

'Although he remembered me within a few days, for the first six months he was nothing like the man I had fallen in love with, it was horrible.

'But I knew that I had to stick by Luke and together we'd make it through.'

Mr Shinnie suffered damage to his brain's visual cortex, causing him short-term memory loss and to forget how the incident happened.

Although his long-term memory had mostly returned within six months, Luke still struggled to retain day-to-day memories - and was devastated to have forgotten baby Zoe's first birthday, despite his family filming the event.

Mr Shinnie said: 'As a parent, not remembering Zoe's first birthday was the worst thing that could happen to anyone.

'Watching the video doesn't help much as it's just like watching someone else's family. Even though I'm in the video, I don't remember a thing.'

To try and build up his memory, Luke had to write down everything he did and had to do during the day.

After being diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrone, he also suffered dizzy spells, excruciatingly 
painful migraines and disrupted sleep.

The engineer admits he ended up losing a lot of friends at that time.

He said: 'My change in personality meant that I wasn't the most pleasant person to be around for a long time.

'Unfortunately some people couldn't understand that, although I looked normal on the outside, I was having problems inside.

'I know now that the people who stood by me at the time are my real friends and I can't put into words how much that means to me.

'That's the only thing that's a silver lining with my memory loss - I can't remember how much of a worse person I was at that time.'

The couple were helped by therapists at brain injury charity Headway and have since been able to rebuild their lives.

Now Mr Shinnie has a new job, where he was promoted after one month, and is looking forward to his wedding.

He said: 'I can't thank Headway and the NHS enough for the work they did with us.

'They were a God send for us, I don't think we would have been able to get through all of this without them.'

Miss Burrows added: 'We've got a new son on the way in the next three weeks so we're both really excited. What I'm most looking forward to is us being a family again and building for the future.
