A quick glance at the balconies on this estate in Portsmouth reveal the usual suspects: washing lines, the odd plant pot, and satellite dishes.

But one resident stands out from the rest - or rather, his balcony does.

Pete Gover has festooned his outdoor space, three storeys up, with more than 200 flowers.

While the sun shines, the 57-year-old taxi driver can often be seen enjoying a glass of orange in his magnificent garden, which is filled with petunias, geraniums, lobelia and lilies.

He even has coaches stopping to admire the fantastic array of colour as they pass by on the Eastern Road, one of the main thoroughfares into the city.

Mr Gover said: 'I have been gradually expanding my display since I started with a couple of pots a few years ago.

'It just seems to grow year on year bu I don't think it can get any bigger now because I've run out of space on my balcony.'

During the heatwave, he has watered the blooms twice a day.

He said: 'It's been quite a struggle in the prolonged dry weather but they seem to be doing better than ever.'

Alan Titchmarsh would be proud.
