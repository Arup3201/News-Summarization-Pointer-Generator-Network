Allowed to roam: Adam Swellings, 19, was on bail for assault when he murdered a father-of-three in 2007

One in seven murders in Britain is committed by suspects freed on bail while awaiting trial for other crimes, according to disturbing new figures.

Last year 56 murders – more than one a week and a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 – were carried out by people bailed by the courts.

If they had been remanded in  custody, the victims’ lives may have been saved.

Criminals on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week, and were responsible for tens of thousands of less serious offences, the Ministry of Justice figures reveal.

Overall, suspects who have been released by the courts commit a crime every ten minutes.

There has been pressure on magistrates in recent years to remand fewer suspects to Britain’s over-crowded prisons, but these figures suggest that too many dangerous criminals are being released.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank said: ‘These figures are horrifying – victims’ families will be sickened.

‘If the authorities have let this happen through sheer incompetence then they need to scale back immediately the use of remand on bail for people suspected of serious crimes.

‘If, on the other hand, they have decided that one extra murder a week is an “acceptable” figure, it only shows how much the public is put at risk by an obsession with keeping down prisoner numbers.’

The figures say there were 60,129 crimes committed last year by people who were on bail. Of these, 42,302 were classified as indictable offences, the most serious.

In addition to the convictions for murder, 16 people were convicted of manslaughter, and 684 for serious violent assaults.

A total of 111 rapes were carried out by people on bail last year, as well as 166 sex offences against children and 6,372 home break-ins.

One in every five burglaries is carried out by a suspect who has already been caught for something else but then released back on to the streets.

In 2011, suspects on bail carried out 41 murders, 857 serious assaults, 102 rapes and 206 sex attacks on children.

Free to kill: Jonathan Vass, 30, was on bail for raping his girlfriend Jane Clough, 26, when he murdered her as she left the hospital where she work, stabbing her over 70 times

Released to kill: In 2012 a total of 56 murders - a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 - were carried out by people due to stand trial

Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke limited the use of prison remand – leaving thousands more offenders at large. 

Judges
are no longer allowed to remand people in custody if their crime will 
not lead to a jail sentence if they are eventually convicted.

Three years ago, Jonathan Vass, 30, murdered his ex-girlfriend while on bail for raping her.

The
former bodybuilder was released by a Crown Court judge despite standing
accused of repeatedly raping nurse Jane Clough, 26, at her Blackpool 
home while she was pregnant with his daughter.

Former paramedic Vass launched the frenzied knife attack on Miss Clough only eight weeks before he was due to stand trial.

Murdered: Father-of-three Garry Newlove was kicked to death by Adam Swellings and two others

Vass,
who stabbed her more than 70 times in the car park of the hospital 
where she worked, was jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 2010 after 
admitting murder.

Since her death, Miss Clough’s 
devastated parents have campaigned to change the law, saying their 
daughter was betrayed by the justice system.

They
have demanded that bail laws be changed to make it harder to grant bail
to perpetrators of domestic violence who are thought to be particularly
dangerous.

The judge who granted Vass bail had been warned about the threat he posed.

Last year teenager Kevyn Viner was jailed for two horrific rape attacks – the second was carried out while he was on bail for the first.

Viner, 18, of Newport, South Wales, was given an 11-year sentence for raping a 25-year-old woman just days after he was released for a similar assault on a 50-year-old victim.

In 2007, teenager Adam Swellings, was on bail for assault when he murdered father-of-three Garry Newlove in Cheshire.

He was allowed out despite a long history of breaching court orders.

One of his bail conditions was that he did not go to Warrington – the town where he killed Mr Newlove.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Dangerous offenders should always be remanded into custody while awaiting trial.

'That’s why the Government changed the law, to allow prosecutors to challenge decisions where a potentially dangerous prisoner could be bailed.

‘The overwhelming majority of people bailed do not reoffend and they are often given strict conditions such as tags and curfews.’
