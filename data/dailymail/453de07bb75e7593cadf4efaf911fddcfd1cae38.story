It’s not just Hurricane Sandy wreaking havoc in North America this week.

The famous hot springs of Haida Gwaii off Canada's west coast have mysteriously dried up following the country's strongest earthquake in 54 years.

A Canada parks inspection team found the island’s three main hot spring pools, where water temperatures have been as high as 162F (72C), bone dry and cold to the touch, the National Post reported.

...And how it was: In recent decades the remote springs have served as one of the most valued tourist attractions in the region

'Not even a small puddle (was left),' Ernie Gladstone, a superintendent for Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, which includes the hot spring island, Gandll K’in Gwaayaay, told the Post.

On Saturday night a massive 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck just off the western side of Haida Gwaii. The tremor eclipsed the 7.0 quake that flattened areas of Haiti in 2010.

Luckily Haida Gwaii escaped with almost no structural damage, but residents living on the coast did panic about the possibility of a tsunami.

Running out of steam: Reports started coming in soon after the earthquake hit on Saturday that a familiar cloud of steam over Haida Gwaii had disappeared

Mystery: It is not yet known why the pools were drained, but experts believe that hundreds of aftershocks, one just over half a mile away from the centuries-old site, may be to blame

The island's beaches were hit by just foot-high waves.

Reports started coming in soon after the earthquake hit that a familiar cloud of steam over the island had disappeared.

In recent decades the remote springs on Gandll K’in Gwaayaay have served as one of the most valued tourist attractions in the region.

About 2,000 people visit the park each year.

'It’s a very culturally significant site,' Mr Gladstone said.

It is not yet know why the pools were drained, but experts believe that hundreds of aftershocks, one just over half a mile away from the site, may be to blame.

'We don’t know if it’s going to come back. We certainly can hope,' Brent
Ward, an earth sciences professor at Simon Fraser University, told the 
Post.

Joseph Ingraham, a Boston fur trader, sailed into the region in 1791 and reported seeing steam rising from the pools. He dubbed the area 'Smoke Bay.'

A 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the British Columbia-Alaska border in 1958.
