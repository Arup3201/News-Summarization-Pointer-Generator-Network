Police in Arizona have apprehended a suspect accused of gunning down at least six people, one of them fatally, in a shooting spree across a Phoenix suburb.

Mesa Detective Esteban Flores said victims were shot Wednesday morning at four locations, including a restaurant and a hotel.

The suspect has not yet been named, but Detective Flores described him as a bald, white man in his 40s with tattoos on his neck and face. He was last seen wearing a black shirt and black shorts. Police believe the shooter was acting alone.

One local station has identified the man suspected of being behind the mass shooting as 41-year-old Ryan Giroux, but authorities have not confirmed that information. 

According to online records, Giroux spent more than six years behind bars for aggravated assault.  

Mesa police closed off an area around the East Valley Institute of Technology on Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, Mesa Community College issued an emergency alert, saying its campus was on lockdown and anyone already there should proceed to the safest location.

The Mesa Police Department said on its Twitter page there was an active shooting in the city, which is less than 15 miles east of Phoenix.

The shooting scene was near a light rail line that travels through the metro Phoenix area.

Just before 1pm local time, Mesa police announced that the alleged shooter was caught in the area of 8th Avenue and Dobson Road. 

Television cameras captured the moment the alleged perpetrator was led by a throng of armed officers in handcuffs. The man was wearing a white hazmat suit, likely because police had removed his clothing to collect DNA evidence. 

Detective Flores told reporters just before 2pm PT that the suspect was taken into custody after a SWAT team spotted him standing on the balcony of a vacant condo in the 1700 block of West Emelita Avenue.  

The man had to be Tasered before officers could put him in handcuffs, Flores said during the media update.  

The first report of shots fired came in at 8.45am from Tri-City Inn on West Main Street, where three people were discovered in a motel room with gunshot wounds

During a press conference at noon Pacific Time, Detective Flores revealed that the first report of shots fired came in at 8.40am from Tri-City Inn on West Main Street, where three people were discovered in a motel room with gunshot wounds. 

A man was pronounced dead at the scene and two women suffered injuries, Flores told reporters, according to AZ Central.

Tanya Ehrig, a 27-year-old mother from Mesa, said the slain victim was her sister's boyfriend. She was photographed sobbing outside the motel swarming with police.

The gunman then moved to nearby Bistro 13, an off-campus restaurant run by EVIT, where he shot a student who was able to go across the street to get help. The victim was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, but he is expected to survive.

Detective Flores said the gunman then carjacked an EVIT teacher in the parking lot and drove the stolen car, a grey Honda Accord, to the Emelita Avenue and South Longmore area.

Shortly after, police got a call about an attempted home invasion in the 900 block of South Dobson Road. Officers who responded to the apartment building found a man suffering from a gunshot wound. He is expected to recover.

Flores said the suspect carried on the crime spree critically wounding another man, described as a maintenance worker, in the 800 block of West Emelita Avenue. 

The Mesa Fire and Medical Department confirmed that it was treating multiple patients linked to the crime spree.

Police cannot say with certainty what sparked the shooting spree, but Flores revealed that a dispute may have occurred between the shooter and the three victims at the motel. He believes the shootings that followed after were random.

Instagram user pacbrim shared images showing heavily armed officers and members of a SWAT team sweeping a residential area accompanied by trained K-9 dogs, with air support from a helicopter surveying the area from above. 

Arizona Gov Doug Ducey released a statement earlier pledging full assistance from the state Department of Public Safety to help capture the gunman.

'I've spoken to Mayor Giles and offered the full support and resources of the state in handling this senseless shooting,' stated Ducey. 'I've also directed the Arizona Department of Public Safety to assist Mesa with any and all resources required.'

Republican Senator John McCain, who represents Arizona, sent out a tweet saying: 'My thoughts and prayers are with the people of #Mesa right now #Arizona'
