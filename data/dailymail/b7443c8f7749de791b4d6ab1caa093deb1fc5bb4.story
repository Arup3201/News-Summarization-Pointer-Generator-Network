A Queensland woman has spoken about her harrowing ordeal after being lost in the bush, naked and without food, for 17 days.

Shannon Fraser was enjoying a day at a Golden Hole Reserve, a popular fishing spot just north of Innisfail, with her fiancee Heath Cassidy and a friend.

Around 11am the mother-of-four was relaxing on the shore while Mr Cassidy, 41, and their friend fished, when an argument escalated after Ms Fraser asked to leave as she was bored.

The pair had met in 2006 and had gotten engaged only two days before Ms Fraser disappeared 

She stormed off into the bush with her towel to calm herself down, and as she was tired from the day's activities, she soon fell asleep.

Ms Fraser woke at dusk, and soon became disoriented and lost, unable to find the track leading back to the reserve as the light faded.

'I had no way of telling where I was', Ms Fraser told Sunday Night. 

Panicking as the darkness fell, Ms Fraser pushed through the dense forest and was soon covered in cuts and scratches, and had her clothes ripped off her by the unforgiving shrubbery and plants inhabiting the area.

Ms Fraser's fiancee, Mr Cassidy, was frantically trying to find her, and wandered around the bush for three hours calling her name before he called the police.

‘I looked around the whole park area and couldn’t see he,' he said.

‘My heart started beating very fast…I got in a panic. I couldn’t believe she was gone, but I didn’t know what to think.'

Mr Cassidy was especially concerned as the  inhospitable rainforest was home to poisonous spiders, snakes, leeches, cassowaries, and crocodiles.

Aware of the dangers that the river could pose, Ms Fraser headed inland, at this point completely naked, and soaked from the torrential downpour soaking the area. 

Rescue helicopters had been called in by police, but the sound of the creek drowned the noise of the choppers and the cries of the searchers brought in to look for Ms Fraser.

Acting Superintendent Rhys Newton was concerned for her safety, given that Ms Fraser had no working phone, no food, and was lost in an area notorious for being unforgiving.

‘From day one I thought she was in trouble,' Superintendent Newton said.

After seven days in the bush, Ms Fraser began to experience severe hunger pains, and was feeling weak and exhausted from the constant walking and exposure to the elements.

She said she would often try to sleep as soon as the sun began to sink so she didn't have to experience being lost and alone in the dark. 

'The nights were the scariest because it was pitch black, that’s how dark the jungle is,' she said. 

‘I just wanted to go home…I cried for my dad a lot, and kept thinking that I miss my family, I miss my kids.' 

‘I kept seeing pictures of my youngest girl as a baby. I knew she would be taking it the hardest.'

Ms Fraser's mother Deidree spoke to the media seven days after her daughter went missing, and said that she suspected there had been foul play.

Ms Cassidy said he believed Ms Fraser's family thought he was involved in her disappearance, which grieved him as he soldiered on looking for his fiancee. 

It was hard knowing that they’re pretty much thinking that I’ve done something. I was in and out of interviews with police,' he said.

Ms Cassidy was adamant that Ms Fraser was still alive, and took a beloved photo of his fiancee with him wherever he went. 

'I knew she was alive. I could feel it. There was a reason why I could feel it, it’s because she’s got a hand over my heart,' he told Sunday Night. 

Twelve days after she went missing, Ms Fraser decided to face her fear of crocodiles and head down to the water to see if she could find her way out by following the river.

After swimming downstream all day, she crawled onto a rock in the middle of the river and slept there, waking up the next morning to discover she had begun to menstruate.

Terrified of attracting crocodiles, Ms Fraser huddled on the rock for three days until her bleeding stopped, exposed to the sun and debilitating heat.

She suffered intense sunburns, which added to her litany of other injuries which she had accumulated after nearly two weeks lost in the bush.

‘I did a lot of soul searching, praying to see my kids again. Making deals with God to let me out,' Ms Fraser said. 

Fifteen days after Ms Fraser disappeared, the search for her was suspended, and her family began to face the reality that she might never be coming home.

The mother-of-four was also facing sure defeat, naked, weak and half-starved, delirious with hunger and exhaustion, covered with cuts and bruises that were now infected. 

‘I sat down on the ground that morning, and I thought I can’t get out, I’m going to die out here,' she said.

'I knew she was alive. I could feel it. There was a reason why I could feel it, it’s because she’s got a hand over my heart,' he said

‘I'm so happy to be home with family, I couldn’t wish for more than that,' said Ms Fraser

'But something told me to get up. I got up and I walked all that day.’

On the sixteenth day after she wandered into the dense scrubland, she spotted a pink ribbon which had been used by searchers to mark where they had looked for Ms Fraser.

The next day, after following the markers all the way back to the path, Ms Fraser emerged into the car park when she had been 17 days before.

‘When I ran down I saw the one car in the car park, but I stopped because I didn’t want to scare the driver,' she said.

'But he opened the door right away and said, everyone's been looking for you.' 

Ms Fraser was rushed to Innisfail Hospital, where she was treated for an extensive array of injuries.

'When my family came in and tried to hug me, I started screaming "Don't touch me". My body was on fire.'

Her appearance had changed dramatically, due to the bites and scratches which were now infected, her severe sunburn, and her significant weight loss.'

'They weighed me when I came into the hospital and I had lost 17 kilos in 17 days.'

‘She looked like a wild woman,' Ms Cassidy said.

'It took me a couple of minutes to realise it was her, she looked so different.'

Ms Fraser said she was very pleased to see her fiancee, but was too busy eating to pay him the full attention he deserved.

‘He was crying and I was eating my soup. I was more worried about the soup,' she said.

Mr Cassidy said that he always knew she would return to him, and could not express how thankful he was to have her back. 

‘This girl is strong, I’m telling you. I feel so relieved shes’ back, its amazing. A miracle,' he said.

Ms Fraser said that she knew he would be waiting for her to come home.

‘He’s my world, he didn’t give up on me,' she said.  

‘I'm so happy to be home with family, I couldn’t wish for more than that'

‘I feel like I've grown a bit wiser. I think I've aged a bit too. I wont take life for granted again. Life’s too short.'
