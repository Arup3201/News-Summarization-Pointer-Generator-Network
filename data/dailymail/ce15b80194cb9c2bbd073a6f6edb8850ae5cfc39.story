Louis van Gaal got into the festive spirit on Thursday as he helped switch on the Old Trafford Christmas tree lights.

On the pitch there hasn't been too much for Manchester United fans to cheer about so far this season, finding themselves 13 points behind the leaders Chelsea after an unspectacular start to Van Gaal's reign. 

The 63-year-old, joined by staff and children from the Stretford High School, looked in good spirits throughout this event though.

Van Gaal's attentions will quickly turn back to the Premier League as they take on Hull City at home on Saturday.

United will be looking to make it three straight league wins against Steve Bruce's men as they look to cement their top four spot heading into the busy festive schedule.
