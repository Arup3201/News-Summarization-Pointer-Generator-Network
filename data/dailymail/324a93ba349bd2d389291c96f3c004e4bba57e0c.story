Stars have filled Westminster Abbey for a service in memory of actor and Oscar-winning film director Richard Attenborough.

Film veteran Lord Attenborough, who dominated the British film business for more than half a century, died last August at the age of 90.

His brother, TV wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough, chose to read from Richard's maiden speech in the House of Lords during the ceremony. 

He said: 'The arts are not a prerequisite of the privileged few; nor are they the playground of the intelligentsia. The arts are for everyone - and failure to include everyone diminishes us all.''

His comments, in front of Dame Judi Dench, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Michael Caine, come as the debate continues about the lack of opportunities for working-class youngsters in the arts. 

Sir Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Hurt and Dame Judi Dench, Robert Lindsay,  former Chelsea footballer Gianfranco Zola and Labour politician Peter Hain were among those seen arriving at the service of thanksgiving in Westminster Abbey.

A star-studded memorial to film legend Richard Attenborough has been held in the majestic quarters of Westminster Abbey in central London, with readings from his brother David 

The 2,000-strong congregation at the 'service of thanksgiving' for Lord Attenborough's life and work was also amused when Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist and broadcaster, read an extract from his late brother's maiden speech to the House of Lords, which began: 'I have it on the best authority – from a not too distant relative – that we are related to apes'

Sir Ben Kingsley, who played the title role in Lord Attenborough's film Gandhi, gave readings from the film. They included: 'There are no goodbyes,' then the final: 'Wherever you'll be, you'll be in my heart'

After suffering a stroke and falling down a flight of stairs in 2008, Lord Attenborough was left unable to read, write, walk and speak properly

The Dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall, said: 'We come to celebrate the life and achievement of Richard Attenborough, a truly great man: certainly a star of stage and screen, but also a pioneer film-maker, an exemplary leader of his profession, a man of deep commitment, of great generosity of spirit, and of personal warmth.'

He added: 'We shall also pray that his story might continue to inspire and inform others to follow his example, that our world might become a little brighter and better.'

In his address, Lord Puttnam described Lord Attenborough as 'gifted, loyal, tenacious, but also deeply sensitive'.

He recalled a story from 1990 when Dickie, as he was called by his friends, led a delegation to Downing Street to discuss the creative industries with then prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

Lord Puttnam said the PM asked why it had taken them so long to get together, to which he said Lord Attenborough replied: 'Because you never asked me, darling.'

A host of politicians, Hollywood stars and industry leaders reflected on the life and times of Lord Attenborough after his death last year.

Born in Cambridge in 1923, he championed the British film industry through its triumphs and trials, enjoying success as one of Britain's leading actors before becoming a celebrated director and prolific movie-maker.

His career highlights included appearing in 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park and clinching eight Oscars for 1982 film Gandhi, including best film and best director.

As an actor he was respected enough for top directors Satyajit Ray and Steven Spielberg to lure him out of self-imposed retirement to appear respectively in The Chess Players and Jurassic Park.

Spielberg, who chose Lord Attenborough to be 'the perfect ringmaster to bring the dinosaurs back to life' in the films, said he was just one person in a long line of 'Dickie's' fans.

Lord Attenborough married the actress Sheila Sim when he was 21. His son Michael was born in 1949, followed by two daughters, Jane and Charlotte.

Tragedy struck on Boxing Day 2004 when his elder daughter Jane Holland, and her daughter, Lucy, and her mother-in-law, also named Jane, were killed in the south-Asian tsunami.

Michael is a theatre director and former artistic director of the Almeida Theatre in Islington, north London, and Charlotte is an actress.

Alan Rickman and Patricia Hodge looked sombre as they made their way into the memorial. The service was told that Lord Attenborough's story will 'continue to inspire and inform others to follow his example, that our world might become a little brighter and better'

Lord Attenborough struck up a friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales, after the Prince of Wales asked him to help her write speeches.

He was given a knighthood in 1976 and in 1993 he became a life peer as Baron Attenborough of Richmond Upon Thames, accepting the labour whip.

Lord Attenborough had been confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke six years ago.

But his family said he never fully recovered and continued to struggle to communicate and move around.

In March last year, he moved into Denville Hall care home because of his failing health.

His wife Sheila Sim, 92, who suffers from dementia, had been based at the home since June 2012.

It was a specialist charity care home for elderly or sick entertainers in west London. Both Lord and Lady Attenborough helped to found the home and fundraised extensively to help its running.
