Personal drones proved one of the most popular Christmas gifts this year but owners are now discovering just how difficult it can be to successfully fly them.

Since Christmas morning many people have taken to social media to share their experiences which in a lot of cases have resulted in drones getting stuck in trees, lost, broken or even injuring someone.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, drone-related incidents increased throughout 2014 and the number is only expected to get worse in the coming months.

Learning to fly a drone — flying devices that often carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers — is something that requires some time and patience say experts. 

'To properly know how to use the system, I would say you need about two weeks, 20 hours a week,' said Adam Gibson, boss of Ctrl.Me, and a professional who regularly organizes training sessions for beginners.

To avoid accidents, you need to both be able to pilot it and configure it correctly in the first place. If it is not set up right, the machine risks crashing. 

'A lot of the crashes that we see are from not properly calibrating the compass or it could also be that someone has painted it and when they paint it, it interferes with the GPS,' said Gibson.

Last year Best Buy sold just one kind of drone, but this year it has expanded its selection to eight different models in stores and five more online because of rising demand. 

BHPhoto.com now offers 140-plus models online that range from $50.99 to $6500. 

Amazon alone is selling 10,000 drones per month and says the Parrot's $160 MiniDrone Rolling Spider and DJI's Phantom 2 Vision+ Quadcopter, which costs about $1,000, have been 'popular sellers.'

Michael Perry, spokesman for DJI, which makes the popular Phantom 2 Vision+ and new Inspire models, said demand for drones has moved 'pretty dramatically out of being a pretty niche field into more of a consumer electronics field.'

Safety concerns have grown with the popularity of drones. In Belgrade in October, a drone carrying a banner over a soccer field ignited an on-field brawl. 

A plane in London's Heathrow airport had a near-miss with a drone in December. And in October an Oregon man pleaded guilty to violating a ban on drones in national parks by flying a one near bison and over Yellowstone's Midway Geyser Basin.

Drone makers say they have put safety measures in place to prevent accident. All drones are recommended for use in large open areas, not near crowded spaces.

DJI said its latest drones have an automatically capped height of 400 feet, even though technically it could go up to 1200 feet. Geosensors also won't let the drones fly close to any major airports. Parrot, which makes the $500 BeBop drone, also ensures drones do not go above 400 feet.

All three of the biggest personal drone makers — DJI, Parrot and 3D Robotics — have formed a coalition to lobby the FAA to help develop standards for personal drone use.

'It's important, no matter how small the drone is, to be aware of your surroundings, making sure you're not operating the drone in a fashion that would endanger anybody,' said former White House advisor Lisa Ellman.

In addition, you have to be sure 'that you're not spying on your neighbors in your backyard,' she added. 

Drone industry officials have also teamed up with the U.S. government and model aircraft hobbyists to launch a safety campaign. 

The campaign includes a website — www.knowbeforeyoufly.com — which advises both drone operators of FAA regulations and how to fly their unmanned aircraft safely.

The industry also said it plans to distribute safety pamphlets at industry events and work with drone manufacturers to make sure safety information is enclosed inside the packaging of new drones.
