An iconic American flag that was marched into battle during the Revolutionary War in 1775 is to be auctioned in New York.

The Forster Flag, the earliest known surviving example to feature 13 white stripes representing the United Colonies, is expected to sell for more than $3 million.

The strips of white silk - six on one side and seven on the other - still stand out proudly against the red background they were sewn on to 239 years ago.

Historic: The flag dates from the Revolutionary War and was owned by the same family for 200 years

As well as being the oldest American flag, it is also one of only authentic colors surviving from the Revolutionary War.

It may not bear much resemblance to the Stars and Stripes but the Forster Flag marks an important step in the evolution of the American flag. 

In 1775, the year it was was first used, early flags bearing 13 stripes - six on one side and seven on the other - to represent the United Colonies had started to appear. 

There were several versions, some with horizontal stripes like the current flags, and others, like the Forster color, that had short strips of white sewn to both sides.

In 1776 a woman called Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag, bearing 13 stripes and a corner of stars against a blue background.

The first official American flag was adopted by Congress in June 1777.

Extra stars were added as more states joined.

In 1814 Francis Scott Key wrote Star Spangled Banner, which became the national anthem.

The American Flag, in its current form of 13 stripes to represent the original states and 50 stars to represent the current ones, was adopted in 1960 after Hawaii joined the U.S.

It was carried into battle by the Manchester Company of the Essex County Militia, as they responded to an alarm for the first battle on April 19, 1775.

As they marched to battle, the men carried aloft the flag, which has seven white stripes on one side, and six on the other.

Although the the troops carrying the flag did not make it into battle that day, the color they carried has remained an iconic part of American history.

For 200 years it was owned by the family of its original owner Samuel Forster, before being bequeathed to the Flag Heritage Foundation in Massachusetts.

Proceeds from its sale, at Doyles in New York today, will be used to raise funds for the Whitney Smith Flag Research Collection at the University of Texas in Austin.

The flag remains unaltered from 1775 and, according to its auction catalog entry, is in 'a remarkable state of preservation'.

Some small stains and splits along the fold were noted, and the auction house said 'the flag is worn in predictable places' along the end and hoist.

John Huss, president of the Manchester Historical Museum, said he longed for the flag to return to its home territory.

'It's something we would love to have,' he told the Gloucester Times, adding that the museum planned to make a bid for it. 

He added that the flags carried into battle were hugely important for soldiers, who would be able to use the flag to find their way back to the regiment.

American history: The Forster Flag appeared in a series of stamps in 2000

Symbolic: The Forster Flag has 13 stripes of white silk sewn on it to represent the original states

The flag has long been an important part of American history and even appeared on a stamp collection in 2000 when the U.S. Postal Service commemorated the evolution of the Stars and Stripes.

The origins of the Forster Flag are unknown, but several experts have suggested that it once had a small British Union flag sewed into the top left corner.

It is believed the Union flag was later pulled off and replaced by the 13 stripes. 

Some have even suggested that the flag 
had belonged to a British regiment and was captured on the first day of 
the American Revolution.

The flag was due to be auctioned on Wednesday morning but no details have yet been released about its final sale price or new owners.
