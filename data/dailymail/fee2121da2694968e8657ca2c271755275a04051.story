Police investigating ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist, it emerged last night.

Kent Police used the billing and call data of a journalist at the Mail on Sunday to unmask the go-between in discussions involving the paper and Constance Briscoe, the judge who was jailed in May for her role in the affair.

Prosecutors in the case, in which Huhne and his wife Vicky Pryce were convicted of perverting the course of justice, wanted Briscoe to give evidence that Huhne had pressured his wife to take speeding points on his behalf.

However, she was abandoned as a witness after it became apparent she had lied to the police about discussing the story with journalists.

The Kent force’s use of its power to obtain telephone records has emerged a month after it was revealed the Metropolitan Police obtained another journalist’s phone data to uncover a whistleblower in the Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair.

The case will raise new concerns about the fundamental right of journalists to protect sources.

Kent Police told the Times newspaper it had used its powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act lawfully.

‘These applications were proportionate, lawful, necessary, recorded and were relevant lines of inquiry for the investigation and the facts were made available to the court and defence,’ a spokesman said.

But Gavin Millar QC, who acted for the Mail on Sunday owner Associated Newspapers in the Huhne case, told the newspaper that rights to confidential sources should only be overridden in matters such as terrorism, organised crime and murder.
