Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert accepts his team must solve their Villa Park problems before they escalate any further.

Lambert is under no illusions after his side's desperate home form continued with a shock 1-0 home defeat to Sky Bet League One side Leyton Orient in the Capital One on Wednesday.

It came after Villa lost a club-record 10 Barclays Premier League games on their own turf last term, and were knocked out of the cups by Tottenham and Sheffield United.

And Lambert, who wants to sign Manchester United's Tom Cleverley before Monday's transfer deadline, knows if they are going to avoid a third straight battle against relegation they must improve.

Speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of Hull, the Scot said: 'The home form is vital to you. We've got to get the home form right. Wednesday was what cup football is about. The chances were there in abundance and we should have won the game, but we were not clinical enough in the final third.

'This Sunday will be a totally different atmosphere from Wednesday night.

'The Premier League is a fantastic league to play in and if we can do as well as in the last two games and have bit of luck, we will win it. The first two league games have been excellent.

'There will be changes from Wednesday - lads are back in the equation. What happened on Wednesday night can't detract from league games although boys are disappointed.'

After the international break, Villa face a daunting run against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton during September and October.

They have claimed four points from their opening two games against Stoke and Newcastle, and Lambert understands the need for victory ahead of their tough run.

'If we take three points this weekend, it'll be seven out of nine, which is a good start,' he said.

'We had the same last year, playing Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea in a in a week.

'I prefer them at the start of season than at the end when everyone is in their stride. We took points off the big ones last season so what's not to say we won't do it again?'

Ron Vlaar (knee) and Aly Cissokho (ankle) are available while Jores Okore (knee) is out but expected to return to training next week.

Christian Benteke (Achilles) and Libor Kozak (broken leg) are making good progress but are at least a month away from comebacks.

Steve Bruce's Hull were knocked out of the Europa League qualifiers by Belgian side Lokeren on Thursday and Lambert expects a response.

'Steve has a good side and has spent bit money,' he added.

'Obviously they went down to 10 men against Stoke last week and, fair play to them, they kept going and got a good point.

'But I think we're playing well enough, we're more solid and have lads to come back - we're ready for it.'
