Stunning forks of lightning were captured on camera during an electrical storm, which raged above Houston, TX, earlier this week.

The sky is completely lit up as two branches of lightning streak through the night sky.

Watch as the bolts, which are hotter than the surface of the sun, extend outward almost indefinitely.

Brilliant white-blue flashes of lightning, such as these, are caused by electrically-charged clouds.

This isn't the first massive thunderstorm to cause such a stunning light show to explode above the state's largest city in recent months.

Houston also experienced a 'super-lightning storm' in April of this year.

Within seconds, the entire night sky is lit up as branches of lightning zigzag above the skyline

These brilliant flashes are created when strong air currents cause electrons to be discharged
