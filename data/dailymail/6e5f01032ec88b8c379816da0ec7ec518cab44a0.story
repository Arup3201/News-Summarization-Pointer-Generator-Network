George Osborne scrapped a 3p rise in fuel duty yesterday in yet another Budget U-turn.

The Chancellor said the move – greeted with delight by campaigners and motoring groups – reflected the ‘very difficult economic times’.

A duty rise in January had previously been axed and the latest freeze knocks £2.10 off the cost of filling up a typical family car.

Embarrassing: In yet another budget backtrack, Mr Osborne told the Commons that the levy would now be 10p a litre lower than under the plans inherited from Labour

Mr Osborne had already staged four 
major Budget U-turns, on pasties, caravans, charities and church works.

His latest retreat follows weeks of pressure from motoring groups, 
industry leaders and even Tory MPs who said the economy could not afford
a tax hike.

Defying the calls, the Chancellor had 
insisted the duty rise was necessary to reduce the Government’s deficit.

Mixed messages: The climbdown comes just a day after Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the planned rise in fuel duty

Only two days ago, Transport Secretary Justine Greening rejected a 
rethink as well, insisting it was better to  pressure retailers to 
reduce pump prices.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who called
yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed, said it was ‘the fastest 
U-turn in history’.

Treasury sources insisted it was not a
U-turn because the hike – scheduled for August – was a policy from the 
last Labour government.

Mr Osborne told MPs the £550million in lost revenue would be made up for by lower than expected departmental spending.

He said fuel was 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been under Labour’s plans.

‘We are on the side of working 
families and businesses and this will fuel our recovery at this very 
difficult economic time for the world,’ the Chancellor added.

Treasury sources said the move was 
discussed a month ago by the Coalition’s all-powerful ‘quad’ – David 
Cameron, Mr Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander.

‘At the Budget we decided to review 
the situation over the summer,’ said an insider. ‘Since then, the 
international situation has deteriorated and the economy went back into 
recession.

‘Oil and pump prices are falling, but 
are still high by historical standards. As for Ed Balls, it’s the 
classic opposition tactic of trying to guess what the Government will do
and calling for it.’

The source insisted it was routine for
changes to fuel duty to be announced outside Budget statements, saying 
Labour had done so four times.

But there were counter-claims that the
final decision was only taken yesterday, ahead of the Chancellor’s last
scheduled appearance before the Commons before the summer recess.

Petrol prices have fallen to an average of 133p a litre, from 138p in March.

Where does your money go? Breakdown of the cost of fuel if the 3.02p fuel duty increase had been approved for this August

Claim: Mr Osborne said fuel was 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been under Labour's plans

Going up: How the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising although for the past year the cost of brent (crude) oil has fallen, but prices have remained high

Professor Stephen Glaister of the RAC 
Foundation said: ‘This is good news for drivers and good news for the 
country.

Road transport powers the nation’s economy and it is welcome 
that the Chancellor recognises the huge pressures the country’s 
35million drivers are under with transport being the biggest single area
of household expenditure bar none.’

Neil Bentley, deputy director-general 
of the CBI, said: ‘This decision will be welcomed by hard-pressed 
families and businesses across the country.’

Jibe: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who called yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed, said it was 'the fastest U-turn in history'

The AA said freezing duty would spare the typical two-car family a £6.41-a-month increase in petrol costs – £76 a year.

Its president, Edmund King, said: 
‘This is great news for all motorists as drivers will breathe an 
enormous sigh of relief with summer holidays about to take off.

‘A duty increase at the same time as the Olympics would have cast a shadow over the UK.’

Quentin Willson, of the campaign group
FairFuel UK, said: ‘Businesses and hard-working families across this 
country will breathe a grateful sigh of relief, at least for the rest of
this year.’

Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who has
led a campaign for a fuel duty freeze, said: ‘Motorists across the 
country will welcome the cut. It will greatly improve the performance of
the economy.’

Some Tory MPs are angry that they have been defending a position their leaders were planning to give up

Just two hours before the Chancellor 
made his announcement to the Commons, party whips circulated ‘lines to 
take’ to MPs, suggesting they attack Labour’s ‘hypocritical’ position.

Mr Balls, who used an article in The 
Sun and TV interviews to urge a Government rethink, said yesterday: 
‘This is the fastest U-turn in history. Labour called for this help for 
families and businesses this morning and I welcome the fact the 
Chancellor backed down this afternoon.

‘With U-turns on petrol, pasties, 
caravans, charities and churches, George Osborne’s Budget is now in 
tatters – a true omnishambles of a Budget from a part-time Chancellor 
whose reputation is now badly damaged.’

August’s 3p rise has been postponed until January.
