Move over, Karl Pilkington – there are two new ‘idiots abroad’ whose holiday exploits are taking audiences by storm.

Anthony Kirkby and Paul Tranter – two Brits who have dubbed themselves the Colburn Idiots Abroad in an ode to the popular television series starring Pilkington – have quickly become an online sensation thanks to a series of short clips documenting their trip to the US.

Through the reach of social media, their videos have garnered nearly one million views and their YouTube channel is being followed by more than 13,000 subscribers in just two days.

People are flipping their lids for Anthony Kirkby, left, and Paul Tranter, whose holiday videos have gone viral 

One of the viral videos, titled ‘Blending in with the locals of LA’, shows Kirkby dragging Tranter out of bed at 6.30am on their first day in sunny Los Angeles.

Moments later, the men stand in front of a mirror to assess their matching tourist outfits – a white T-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, tacky shorts featuring the Stars and Stripes, and wide-rimmed sunglasses styled after Old Glory.

An enthusiastic Kirkby, 30, says: ‘Honestly, they will love us. We fit right in.’

Tranter, 32, isn’t pleased, telling his travel mate: ‘We’ll get beaten up!’

Another clip shows them surveying a light fixture they damaged while climbing through a window in the middle of the night after they were locked out of the pub where they were staying.

They also filmed clips of an exotic dancer on Hollywood Boulevard and one of themselves watching a Manchester United match in a bar.

While watching the football match, Tranter tells the camera: 'I could have done this at home.' 

Kirkby is a serving member of the British Army, while Tranter is a former soldier who now works as a production supervisor with a company that manufactures and supplies pipeline products. 

They said they decided to create the videos as a laugh for their family and friends back home.

Tranter added: ‘We quite often make stupid videos back at home to make our friends laugh and we thought this would be a funny thing to do.

‘We can look back on it in years to come and laugh watching them back.’ 

Nearly one million people have watched the holiday exploits of Anthony Kirkby, left, and Paul Tranter 

More than 4,000 people have commented on the North Yorkshire pair’s profanity-laden videos in a thread on the social-networking website Reddit.

The wildly popular travellers have gained a legion of fans and they have been overwhelmed with offers from Americans who want to play a role in their adventure.

Kirkby and Tranter received VIP treatment at a comedy club and were given a free tour of Universal Studios. They have also been offered free tickets to a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game, a free day at a shooting range, guided tours of LA and San Francisco and an invite to a house party in the Hollywood Hills.

The men have also met with a representative of a US company that helps amateur filmmakers profit from their videos.

Their two-week tour will take them to San Diego, San Francisco and Las Vegas, where they hope to catch a glimpse of Sheffield boxer Kell Brook before his title fight against Shawn Porter. 

One commenter on Reddit urged the Brits to share more of their exploits: ‘The perfect tourist duo. The enthusiastic funny guy and his friend who's annoyed by his silly antics. I hope they make more videos.’

Another viewer said: ‘Watching this video was the first time I realized this. Every American I know, myself included, would see these guys and just love them to pieces.’

Online commenters suggested the pair be given their own television show or a guest spot on a late-night chat show in the US.

One viewer predicted their star status will grow: ‘Beyond internet famous, I'm sure that by the end of the day people will recognize them and be asking to have their picture taken with them for karma.’
