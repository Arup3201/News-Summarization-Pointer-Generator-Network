A Facebook page created to shame overweight people is causing outrage, especially among those who were pictured on the site without their permission

'530 Fatties,' which was taken down Monday, featured photos of people who live within the Northern California area code 530, along with comments mocking their size.

Most of the shots appear to have been taken in public while the person targeted was completely unaware that he or she was being photographed - and the identity of the page's administrator remains unknown.

'Hurtful and embarrassing': 18-year-old Jessi Lynn Howell discovered a photo of herself on '530 Fatties,' a Facebook page created to mock overweight people

Candid camera: Those featured on the page seem unaware they are having their photos taken

'It's really hurtful and it's really embarrassing,' 18-year-old Jessi Lynn Howell told CNN after finding an image of herself on the page.

'They post people's pictures without their permission - that's hurtful,' she said, adding, 'I know it's probably someone from around here and whoever it is, they need to stop.'

According to CBS13, most of the subjects were residents of Yuba and Sutter counties.

Weighty matter: Jessi Lynn says that a photo featured on the page was taken when she was 50 pounds heavier

Speaking out: 'Cyberbullying - bullying period - needs to stop,' she said

Jessi Lynn said that the photo of her was taken back in October, when she was 50 pounds heavier, and she has since slimmed down thanks to medication.

The teen, who has struggled with her weight due to medical problems, told CNN that she was compelled to speak out on the controversy on behalf of those who haven't.

'Cyberbullying - bullying period - needs to stop. So I'm going to be that voice today for those people who don't have that voice,' she said

CBS13 tried to contact the administrator of the page before it was removed, but the number listed was disconnected.
