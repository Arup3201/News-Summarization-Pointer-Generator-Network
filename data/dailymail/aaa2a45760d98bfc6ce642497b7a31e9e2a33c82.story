A long-lost Gold Rush town that had been submerged beneath a lake has been revealed its secrets for the first time in 60 years.

December has been one of the driest months ever recorded in California, causing a huge drop in water levels at Folsom Lake and revealed the remnants of the town of Mormon Island.

The town was set up in 1848 after prospectors struck upon gold in nearby Coloma. At its peak, it was home to 2,500 Mormon immigrants seeking riches in the region.

The crumbling walls of a structure on Mormon Island in California were revealed this week after the state had one of the driest months on record

It reportedly had four hotels, a school and seven saloons during the boom times but after the wealth ran out, only a few families were left by the 1940s.

The town was finally torn down for the Folson Dam project which flooded the site on which it stood during the 1950s.

Mormon Island, which is a California Historical Landmark, came into view for the first time in 60 years due to the recent dry spell.

The stone foundations of the town are now visible along with piles of rusty, square-headed nails, tool parts and broken bottles.

Along the waterfront are crumbling, stone foundations which are believed to have been the sites of a winery and a dairy. A portion of a stone water well is also now visible.

Amateur archaeologist Alex Caudill, who brought his son Skyler to see the ruins, told KCRA: 'I always love stuff like this, it's history.

'It's kind of sad that they knocked out a lot of these towns but they had to do it.'

Park rangers encouraged people to come visit but warned not to touch anything as Mormon Lake is a protected landmark.

The dry weather is spurring some 
cities and counties in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region to issue 
water conservation orders earlier than usual.

The
 city of Folsom has already imposed a mandatory 20-per cent water 
conservation order, while Sacramento County has asked residents in 
unincorporated areas to reduce water use by 20 per cent.

The cities of Roseville and Sacramento are also likely to consider similar measures in early January.

If no rain falls in the remaining days of 2013, it could rank as the driest calendar year in state history.

While a drought has not been declared by Governor Jerry Brown, he has assembled a task force to monitor and study the issue.
