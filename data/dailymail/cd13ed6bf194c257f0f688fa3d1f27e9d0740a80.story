Christina Reber, 45, from Indiana allegedly marched into her ex's house and squeezed his genitals 'as hard as she could'

A mother who tore the scrotum of her former 'on-off boyfriend’ during a row at his home is now claiming she did so in self-defense.

Christina Lorina Reber, 45, from Marion, Indiana, was arrested in 2012 after she allegedly marched into her ex’s home, grabbed hold of his genitals and squeezed ‘as hard as she could’.

She is due to stand trial on March 12 at Delaware Circuit Court on a charge of aggravated battery.

She faces ten years in prison if found guilty.

The victim, 57, was left with a deep tear to his scrotum following the attack in Muncie, Indiana and was treated at nearby Ball Memorial Hospital.

The 57-year-old said that Reber attacked him while drunk because he had ended their eight-month relationship.

The police report said: '(The victim) stated that after he grabbed Reber, he felt her grab 
his scrotum and begin squeezing as hard as she could.

'(He) stated that he was in incredible pain when Reber grabbed his scrotum and began digging in her fingers.

'(He) stated that Reber refused to let go of his scrotum and that both of them fell to the ground.'

The report noted that the victim was covered in blood - and part of his scrotum had been completely torn from his body.

According to the police report, Reber 
walked into the victim’s property unannounced and yelled at him to ‘call
 the f****** police’ before she attacked him.

Last week, Reber's defense attorney Zaki Ali filed a self-defense notice before the trial begins, according to indystar.com.

At a recent pre-trial ruling, Judge Marianne Vorhees said Reber would not be able to put an 'expert witness' on the stand to put forward a theory that because her 57-year-old victim was wearing an unspecified 'personal device' he was more likely to be injured.

She is currently out on bail after she provided a $10,000 bond.
