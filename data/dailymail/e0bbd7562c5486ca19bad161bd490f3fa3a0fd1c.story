A Florida woman who while 'on meth' last week believed that she and her boyfriend were trapped in unlocked closet filled with feces has a sordid arrest history.

Amber Campbell, 25, and John Arwood, 31, were freed - and then arrested last Tuesday after calling 911 for help, only to be told by police they could have just opened the door themselves.

Campbell has had run-ins with the law before and two years ago nearly escaped arrest by running into the woods.

Trapped: Amber Campbell believed she was locked inside of the closet with her boyfriend John Arwood, 31, and the pair called police to free them after two days 

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Campbell escaped from a mental health facility on April, 30, 2013 and when authorities finally captured her she fooled police so that she could slip out of her handcuffs and run into the woods.

A deputy chased her by foot into the wooded area and she allegedly attacked him several times.

Campbell, 23 at the time, was shocked with a stun gun and then sentenced three years of probation.

When police initially found Campbell she and a female friend were walking along a country road, a mile south of where she crashed her brother's car after escaping the mental health facility.

When police asked Campbell her name she provided a false identity and birthday and claimed she was not the driver of the decimated vehicle.

She was cuffed and put into a police car where she complained she couldn't breathe.

Police took pity on her and lowered the car windows and loosened her cuffs a bit and that's when she managed to escape.

She ran from the car, jumped a barbed wire fence, and scampered off into the woods with police running behind her.

She then allegedly punched a deputy who in response, shocked her two to three times with a stun gun.

Campbell was charged with escape, aggravated battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence and giving a false name upon being arrested, reports The Orlando Sentinel.

She was sentenced to three years probation which she violated after last week's arrest.

Campbell, now 25, and her boyfriend didn't try to escape police last Tuesday but instead begged for their help. 

The two allegedly believed they were locked inside of a janitor's closet and waited two days to seek help.

The strange incident occurred at the Marine and Environmental Science Center at Daytona State College.

Locked in: Amber Campbell, 25, and John Arwood, 31, were freed - and then arrested last Tuesday after calling 911 for help, only to be told by police they could have just opened the door themselves

Inside the closet, police said they found feces and copper scouring pads used to smoke meth and crack cocaine.

Police said they smelled meth in the closet.

Campbell and Arwood claim to have been chased into the closet on Sunday.

It is not known what they were doing at the facility.

The campus was closed for the holidays.

It is also not clear why the pair waited until Tuesday to seek help.

However Arwood called 911 and told police they were trapped.

Police used his cell phone to trace the location and arrived to let the two out.

But an officer, trying to understand what had happened, went into the closet and shut the door.

The door did not lock.

Arwood and Campbell were charged with trespassing.

No drugs were found.

Campbell was also charged with violating her probation, stemming from a 2013 arrest.

Arwood has a colorful criminal history.

He has been to jail five times, with his first stint in 2000.

His offenses range from armed burglary, possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana and fleeing law enforcement.
