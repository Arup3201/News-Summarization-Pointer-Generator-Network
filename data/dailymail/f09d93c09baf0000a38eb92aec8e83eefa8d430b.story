The busy pavement of Broadway in New York
 City has come a long way since 1848, when the oldest photo of the 
historical street was captured.

The
 photo sold at an auction in New England for $62,500 is unrecognizable when compared to the bright lights and bustling energy of Broadway today.

The New York Daily News reported that on the back of the photograph it said, 'taken the last of October, when nearly half of the leaves were off the trees.'

The real deal: This photo sold for $62,500 at an auction a few years ago and shows a quite different Broadway than the one we know today

The photo is likely of Bloomingdale road which became Broadway in 1899, reported Gizmodo.com.

The New York Daily News reported that Bloomingdale road is now what would be Manhattan's Upper West Side. The photograph referred to the location as being 'the main road' and is thought to be an extension of Broadway.

The photo is a daguerreotype, a style of photography invented by Louis Daguerre and Joseph Niepce in 1839. It is one of the earliest photographic processes and is the world's first permanent camera, according to The Daguerreian Society.

Daguerre was a visual artist and a developer of the diorama theater. Neipce invented the world's first image capturing heliograph in July 1822 and when the men joined forces they were able to create a contraption that would capture an image that could later be developed into a photograph.

According to daguerreobase.org, 'A daguerreotype consists of a silvered copper plate, which bears the image, and a housing to protect the plate.'

The photo was then developed in a dark room in two ways: either by exposing the plate to heated mercury or by exposing the plate to solar rays through a red filter.

Gizmodo reports that the daguerreotype made it's way from France to New York in 1839 and very few photos have survived. Therefore, there may be an old photo of New York somewhere else but it is highly unlikely.

The oldest photo surfaced yesterday when a twitter user by the name of NewYorkologist posted a photo he claimed was the oldest. It read, 'Believed to be the oldest photograph taken of New York City.-Broadway 1850.' 

Websites like Gizmodo.com and Petapixel.com proved him wrong by publishing the true old new york, trees and white picket fences and all.
