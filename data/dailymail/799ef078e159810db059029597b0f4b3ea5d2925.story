From grappling with a smartphone to using social media, for some people, technological advances can be a headache.

But one man has embraced a lot of them and uses 700 systems at once to monitor his every move and mood.

Chris Dancy, who is accepted to be ‘the most quantified human’ in the world, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him.

Chris Dancy, 45, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him.

These include a Pebble smartwatch, Google Glass, a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor.

He collects data about what he eats, when he sleeps, how he uses his email, his health, travel plans and photos and even his dogs' levels of activity.

Collecting data about his eating habits and fitness has enabled Mr Dancy to lose 100lbs (45kg) in weight.

His home is also hooked up with gadgets, including a smart lighting system and a mattress cover that collects data in his sleep.

He has been monitoring and collecting his personal data for five years, adding two or three systems every week.

His connected lifestyle means he knows himself better than anyone and all this monitoring has even allowed him to lose 100lbs (45kg) by tracking how much he moves and eats.

Mr Dancy, 45 from Denver, said: ‘When I touch something, I try to make sure it’s a something that I can get information out of so I can track, then search it, visualise it and share it with people who might want that piece of it.

‘I know now what to drink, what to eat, when to sleep and when to actually make myself get up. Very simple things like that.

‘It’s body and mind hacking. Just like we
 hack computers and any type of data, your body and your mind is the 
greatest information system humanity has ever known and understanding it
 makes it hackable.’

Mr Dancy describes his lifestyle as 'body and mind hacking' and believes that the mind is greatest information system humanity has ever known and that understanding it makes it hackable.

Mr Dancy has a plethora of wearable technology on his person at all times, including a Pebble smartwatch and Google Glass to a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor.

His home is also hooked up with numerous sensors for products such as the smartphone-controlled Hue lighting system and a Beddit mattress cover, which collects data on his sleep.

The dedicated technophile also tracks the progress of his two dogs by collecting data on their daily activities via pet GPS system, Tagg.

Explaining how he adopted his futuristic lifestyle, he said: ‘I realised I was putting a lot of information online and if one of these services went out of business, I would have been without a lot of information that was relevant, at least to me at that time.

‘It really started with me having a desire to digitally collect what I was creating. I just spent the last five years bringing on two to three systems a week.’

Mr Dancy collects and uses the data to his advantage and by tracking his eating and fitness habits he has seen a huge benefit to his health, including weight loss.

Mr Dancy's data obsession started when he wanted to digitally collect what he was creating and in the last five years he has added a system a week. Here are some of the subjects he collects data on, including: health, work, content and money

Mr Dancy thinks that people don't understand the value of their information or they don't want to learn how to use it. Here is a graph showing his mood over a week

He is surprised that others have not followed him in collecting data to track their lives in the same way.

‘I have had a lot of people tell me they want to do it or they are working on it but it has been two-and-a half-years since people starting learning about me and no one has really done it. I don’t know what the hold up is as to me it is very easy to do.

‘Either they don’t understand the value of the information or it is just something hard for them to break,’ he said.

Chris has now become a sought after individual for both major companies and start-ups who hope he can help them to develop smarter products.

‘I have had everybody from people who wanted to make smart cups to people who want to make underwear to major beverage companies and sportswear companies,’ he said.

He is surprised that others have not followed him in collecting data to track their lives in the same way. These maps show photos taken in cities that Mr Dancy has visited in recent times

‘I don’t want to name drop but almost every big company and a lot of start-ups have reached out to me. I give them advice and I will spend time creating what I think are good solutions for them.’

He believes that people will use more technology around the home before they adopt wearable gadgets.

He said: ‘I think wearables will be confined to the health market for next two years.

‘It’s not about a refrigerator that knows you’re out of butter. It is about a lighting system that says take an umbrella, it’s going to rain in an hour, just by flashing blue near your front door. No one needs something to read their texts or talk to you, they just need subtle reminders.’

In his video, Mr Dancy pronounced the internet dead and said: 'The "innernet" - the information of you - is the future'.
