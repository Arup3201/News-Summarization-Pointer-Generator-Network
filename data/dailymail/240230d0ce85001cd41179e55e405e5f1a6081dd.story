Stereosonic music festival is one of the largest and most popular in the Australia, and last weekend the festival hit Sydney.

It's clear that people are still intent on parting hard. But in a video posted to social media, one man looks as though he was having a little too much fun.

Sitting in the stands at one of the many stages spread around Sydney Showgrounds,  the reveler is dressed in a rainbow coloured singlet, denim shorts and slip-on shoes. 

One man at Stereosonic festival in Sydney at the weekend was so inebriated he tried to take photos with his credit card thinking it was his phone

Lost in his own world, the partygoer throws his arms around while still seated, thrashing his head in an attempt to keep up to the beat of the music.

As the music pumps around him he stands up and moves to the fence in front of him to look down on the stage and dancers below. 

Then, deciding this would be an appropriate moment to try and capture a photograph, the confused festival goer pulls his wallet out his pocket.

Still dancing, he holds his wallet out in front of him, he fumbles and looks to be trying to swipe his wallet as if it's an iPhone.

The man then pulls out a credit card, thinking it is a camera, and clutches it like a phone.

He seems to try and take photographs while holding out the card, staring at it as if it has a screen.

Then, realising that he has been unsuccessful in capturing a 'photo' - or maybe thinking he had captured some great shots - the man puts his card back into his wallet.

The clip has had hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook, and has been shared thousands of times by people who can't believe what they're seeing.

Many social media users have expressed how hilarious they find the footage, while others have expressed their concern for the man, who is clearly very inebriated.
