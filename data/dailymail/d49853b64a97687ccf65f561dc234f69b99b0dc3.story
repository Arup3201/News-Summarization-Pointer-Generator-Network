A wealthy French hermit, whose marriage to a glamorous Parisian estate agent made headlines around the world, cut her out of his will before he died.

The marriage of toothless land owner Marcel Amphoux to Sandrine Devillard, who was 25 years his junior, caused controversy in France after residents in Puy-Saint-Pierre turned out to boo and whistle throughout the ceremony.

They said they were concerned about Devillard's motivation for marrying the 68-year-old, who lived in a hut close to the Italian border without electricity or running water.

Amphoux, who died in a crash in November, owned five shepherd's huts close to Alpine ski resort Serre Chevalier.

The huts may be worth hundreds of thousands of euros each if they were converted into ski chalets.

Land in the area is worth up to 3,500 euros per square metre, local media reported. 

But, Amphoux's blonde wife, 42, has been cut out of his will and has been left nothing, according to The Independent.

A local lawyer has told the newspaper that Amphoux's will has been uncovered.

He said that it was written on the back of an envelope in the weeks before he died.

According to the reports the 
shepherd's huts have been left to the tenants and the rest of his estate
has been left to an unnamed beneficiary.

Lawyer Jean-Michel Colmant was quoted 
in The Independent as saying: 'Everyone who has seen it confirms that it
is in Marcel's writing. He has clearly stated that he wishes to leave 
nothing to his wife.'

Devillard has not commented but is expected to contest the will.

Puy-Saint-Pierre villagers speculated about the Parisian estate agent's motivation for marrying toothless Amphoux, who lived in a hut without running water or electricity

French media reported the romance began when Devillard approached Amphoux in a bid to buy his land.

He refused and they began a relationship soon afterwards.

Villagers said she told tenants that they were being evicted and that the huts were hers.

Village mayor Jean-Marius Barnéoud reportedly even asked police to investigate the unlikely union over fears Amphoux was being duped into marrying her.

Photographs of their wedding appeared in national newspapers.

She wore a raspberry, satin gown with gold jewellery and a bejewelled handbag.

Amphoux was dressed in a suit but kept his floppy hat on for the ceremony.

After intense speculation about her motivation for marrying Amphoux, Devillard attempted to silence her critics with a self-penned song and music video about her love for her husband.

In the video for The Call of the Sun, Devillard is dressed in a medieval-style dress as she runs around the mountains.

Amphoux also appears but wears a hood that covers his face.

Devillard said at the time: 'Marcel is a man from the Middle Ages, even prehistoric times.

'I am a true Parisian. I still live there. But I visit my husband as often as I can. To see him and to make him smile,' according to The Independent.
