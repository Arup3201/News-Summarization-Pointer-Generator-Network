Comedian Sarah Silverman has been inundated with condolences after announcing to the world her pet dog has died.

Well-wishers were moved to console the U.S. TV star after she wrote a touching tribute to her beloved Duck 'Doug' Silverman - described as her 'constant companion' and 'longest relationship'.

Writing on the social network whosay, the 42-year-old stand-up told followers how she cradled him during his last moments alive and of the bond she formed with the dog she rescued from an animal shelter 14 years ago.

Remembered: Sarah Silverman told her more than 4.6million twitter followers about the death of her 'best friend' 'Duck'

In anguishing details she told of the last minutes of his life: 'I held him and kissed him and whispered 
to him well passed his passing. I picked him up and his body was limp – 
you don’t think about the head – it just falls. I held him so tight.'

She wrote: 'He was a happy dog, though serene. And stoic. And he loved love.

'Over
the past few years he became blind, deaf, and arthritic. But with a 
great vet, good meds, and a first rate seeing-eye person named me, he 
truly seemed comfortable.

'Recently,
however, he stopped eating or drinking. He was skin and bones and so 
weak. I couldn’t figure out this hunger strike. Duck had never been 
political before. And then, over the weekend, I knew. It was time to let
him go.

'My boyfriend Kyle 
flew in late last night and took the day off from work to be with us. We
laid in bed and massaged his tiny body, as we love to do – hearing his 
little “I’m in heaven” breaths.

'The
doctor came and Kyle, my sister, Laura and I laid on the bed. I held 
him close – in our usual spoon position and stroked him. I told him how 
loved he was, and thanked him for giving me such happiness and for his 
unwavering companionship and love.'

The vet then administered 'basically 
an overdose of sleeping meds', Ms Silverman said, adding: 'And then 
finally, when his body lost its heat, and I could sense the doctor 
thinking about the imminent rush hour traffic, I handed him over.'

Sighning
off, she added: '14 years. My longest relationship. My only experience 
of maternal love. My constant companion. My best friend. Duck.'

The obituary, written last night, prompted a wave of sympathy from people around the world.

Emilio Archibeque wrote: 'So sorry to
hear about your lil ducky. My partner and I went through the same thing
early January with our old boy "Sonny".

'It was the hardest thing we 
ever had to do. I think I cried non-stop for weeks. But it does get 
easier "if you can believe that" at this moment for you. Now I'm 
starting to cry again.'

While
another called Roxy Russell added: 'OMG Sarah! Thank you for sharing 
yourself and your sweet duck in thise loving tribute.'
