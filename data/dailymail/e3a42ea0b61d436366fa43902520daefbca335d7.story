Uber customers will be able to listen to their own music when they call a car, thanks to a new deal with streaming music site Spotify.

The controversial car firm will allow people  to link their Spotify and Uber accounts.

When they get into the car, they can select a special Uber playlist, or one of their own, and have it play through the car's speakers - if the driver has opted it.

Users simply select music from any one of Uber's featured playlists or one of their own Spotify playlists within the Uber app. When the car arrives, the user's tunes will be playing on the speakers.

User's can first link their Spotify account via the Uber app and request a ride.

'Uber users who link their Spotify account to their Uber account can basically push a button and get a ride, and get into the car, and in the car their Spotify music, their Spotify station is playing,' said Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, during a conference call with journalists to announced the partnership.

'For Uber, it's the first time we've personalised the experience inside the car.' 

The feature will be available in 10 cities: London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Nashville, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney and Toronto, although Kalanick stressed that the new feature will be optional for drivers. 

Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek said: 'One of the big things for us is how do we get into the car. Given that people's average commute time is 30 minutes to an hour, how do we get into that space and allow people to play their music?' 

'Instead of just doing car integrations, we thought 'what's the next generation of transportation system?' Uber is an obvious fit for us.'

When they are matched up with a Spotify-enabled Uber, users simply select music from any one of Uber's featured playlists or one of their own Spotify playlists within the Uber app.

The move comes as Spotify is facing a battle with Taylor Swift, who pulled her albums from the service and accused it of not fairly compensating artists and songwriters for streams of their work.

'I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music,' she told Yahoo in an interview.

Uber has also faced allegations of an organised effort to poach drivers from rival Lyft and demonstrations against the company by taxi drivers in several European cities.
