When Sofia Vergara and Nick Loeb split in late May, it was assumed they were geographically incompatible (she lives in Los Angeles while he calls New York City home).

But the publicity man explained to InTouch this week that while he wanted a family, the Colombian beauty (who already has a 22-year-old son) was more interested in fame.

'She's focused on her career,' the 39-year-old New Yorker said. 'The most important thing for me is to get married and have kids.'

The Loeb's Crunch founder added, 'I completely understand. She's at the height of her career, and, as she says all the time, she's taking advantage of her 15 minutes of fame because who knows how long that will last.'

At age 42, Vergara is at the height of her career with a hit TV series (Modern Family) and  starring roles in movies (such as Fading Gigolo).

The cover girl also has numerous endorsement deals and her own perfume, which launched in September.

Loeb added her new beau Joe Manganiello, 37, is a smarter choice for the actress. 'They are much better suited for each other,' he offered.

The heir to the Loeb fortune did not clear up whether he was dating Sharon Stone, 56, or not. The two were caught getting cozy in New York City earlier this month, according to UsWeekly.

Stone and Vergara worked together on Fading Gigolo, which was released in 2013. 

Still, Vergara and Loeb seem to be on good terms. At New York's Angel Ball on Monday evening they said hello to each other.

Sofia was being interviewed by Extra's AJ Calloway. 

Whether Loeb planned the meeting or just happened to pass by his former fiancee, he didn't get much of a reaction on the carpet. 

Their meeting was brief.

Both have claimed to remain friends following the end of their two-year engagement.

Despite the absence of Vergara’s current boyfriend due to Manganiello’s filming obligations, the actress didn’t have to spend the evening alone - her adult son, Manolo,  accompanied Vergara through the night.
