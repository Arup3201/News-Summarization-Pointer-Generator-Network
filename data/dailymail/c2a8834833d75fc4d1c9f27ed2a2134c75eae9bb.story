A brave bird has given her owners the slip - after stowing away in a delivery van and making a bid for freedom 40 miles from home.

In a scene which could have come straight from the hit animated movie about a group of poultry desperate to escape from their coop, Agatha the chicken managed to hide on a delivery truck at her owners' home in Derby.

And when the driver pulled up at his next stop, 40 miles away in Hathersage, Yorkshire, on Saturday, he was stunned when Agatha flung herself out of his van - and made a run for it.

for Agatha the chicken disappeared in the back of a
delivery van. She is pictured here with another pet chicken.Â 

Melanie, who runs a construction firm with her family, said: 'We really miss having Agatha about - she's a real character and we'd love to find her and bring her home.

'We can't believe she's done a real-life Chicken Run - but she's such a character, we knew if any of our chickens was going to go on such an adventure, it would be her.

'She was named after Agatha Christie, so it's quite fitting she's created her own little mystery for us to solve.

'She's a very nosy chicken, and always poking her beak into what's going on - so we're not hugely surprised that she got herself into the back of a truck.

'We thought a fox had got her after she disappeared on Saturday - but it suddenly occurred to me that she had been hanging around the delivery van, and I phoned the delivery company to ask if they'd seen her.

'I thought they'd probably laugh at me, but they said they had found a chicken in one of their vehicles.

'The delivery driver got a huge fright when he opened the doors and she came flying out.

'He said she'd run off before he had a chance to realise what was going on.'

Melanie is now desperately trying to find Agatha and believes she wouldn't have got too far from Hathersage.

She added: 'We just hope that she hasn't been caught by a fox but she's a pretty wily bird, so we're sure she'll be fine.

'Agatha is very friendly, and if you whistle, she'll come waddling straight over to you.

'We are doing some building work at our house and Agatha knows, as soon as the mini-digger comes out, that there'll be lots of worms so she runs straight over - she's very

'We'd love to have her back - and just hope that someone out there has spotted her.'
