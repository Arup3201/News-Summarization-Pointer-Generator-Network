An Australian CEO of a Bitcoin exchange company has been killed in a motorbike accident while holidaying in Thailand.

Adam Tepper, 34, died when he collided with a pole on the island of Phuket. It was reported by local media that he was not wearing a helmet.

The Australian expat reportedly suffered from fatal head injuries, according to Thai media reports.

Thai police confirmed he died on impact as the crashed occurred. He was in Thailand on holidays, according to media reports.

'Mr Tepper was not wearing a helmet and struck his head on the sign — he died instantly,' said Capt Thada Sodarak of the Chalong Police.

'I believe he was moving very fast at the time of the crash, as part of the sign pole was buried a metre underground, and it was pulled out by the impact.'

Mr Tepper, a keen sailor, had relocated from Melbourne to Sydney after founding Independent Reserve in 2013.

'He will be sorely missed by his family, friends and bitcoin community,' Mr Przelozny said in a statement.

'He lived his life by the beat of his own drum.'

Mr Tepper was a well-known member of the community in Phuket, particularly for his bright orange Lotus Exige S sports car, The Age reports. 

The spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs told Daily Mail Australia that it was providing consular assistance to Mr Tepper's family.
