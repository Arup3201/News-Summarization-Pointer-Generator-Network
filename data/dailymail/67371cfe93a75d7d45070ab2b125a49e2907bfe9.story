A California couple now in their seventies were given a big shock as they were getting their paperwork together in case one of them passed away.

The person at their local county records office told them their marriage from 48 years back was never legally recognized because they had no marriage license.

Norma and Bob Clark of Redlands, California, had their second marriage this month to make sure all paperwork was properly accounted for.

Second wedding: Norma and Bob Clark (on the left) were remarried this month after discovering their original marriage in 1964 was never legally recognized.

Big oversight: The pastor who married the couple 48 years ago apparently never returned their marriage license to the county record office, where it would have become a marriage certificate

The two first wedded on August 29, 1964, in the company of close friends and family.

But the pastor who married the couple apparently never returned their marriage license to the county record office, where it would have become a marriage certificate, according to the Redlands Daily Facts.

The couple recently sent $20 to the San Mateo County Hall of Records to retrieve a copy of the certificate, but there was no record of their ceremony from 48 years ago, they said.

‘I couldn't find it, and couldn't find it for a reason, because it wasn't there,’ Mrs Clark later told NBC News.

Marriage certificates must be filed within two years of the ceremony, the Clarks soon learned, and they were told they would have to register their wedding in San Bernardino County to make their marriage legal once and for all.

So Mr Clark went to over to the San Bernardino County Hall of Records to remedy the situation. 

‘I just went in there thinking I could just do it, and she said, “No, no, you have to have witnesses,”’ he said.

‘Well, you know most people at our wedding are dead. If we had waited a couple more years, we would have been in trouble.’

Bureaucratic rules: Marriage certificates must be filed within two years of the ceremony, the Clarks learned, and they were told they would have to register their wedding in San Bernardino County to make their marriage legal

Déjà vu: Mrs Clark's sister, Deanna Silvestri, and her brother, Bill Thrall, rejoined them for their second wedding to serve as witnesses of both ceremonies.

Fortunately, the Clarks had their original maid of honor and junior usher -- Mrs Clark's sister, Deanna Silvestri, and her brother, Bill Thrall -- visiting for the holidays.

The four of them, along with others, were finally able to make the marriage official.

Alexander, the Clarks' son, attended their second marriage.

‘My sister and I, we just kind of joked that we didn't have to throw them a 50th anniversary party anymore,’ he said.

Norma and Bob Clark met as students at Santa Fe State.

Ms Clark was studying there to receive a degree in arts while Mr Clark was studying to get his master's degree in sociology.

The two met while Mr Clark was giving a report, he told the Redlands Daily Facts. He said that Norma immediately caught his eye.

‘I thought she was kind of cute,’ he said.

This year alone, 30 other local couples have run into the same problem as the Clarks, according to the San Bernardino Country Hall of Records.

The couple say they now have some advice for other married and soon-to-be married couples:

Make sure your marriage license exists.

Laughing it off: Ms Clark said friends in their town had teased the couple, asking when the reception would be
