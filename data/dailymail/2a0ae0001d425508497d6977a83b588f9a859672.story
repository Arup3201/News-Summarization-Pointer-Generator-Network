A controversial documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, claims the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 

On Monday makers of the film Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief sat down for a panel discussion, where they addressed the alleged role the church played in the demise of the Hollywood couple's marriage. 

Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times, between author Lawrence Wright (who wrote the book the film is based on), filmmaker Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder.

Revelations: A documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival alleges that the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman 

In the film Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife. 

Monday's panel discussion focused in on Rathbun's claims. 

'David Miscavige [leader of the Church of Scientology] was terrified that he was losing control of Tom Cruise, because Tom Cruise is the greatest rainmaker really, for Scientology,' Gibney claimed.

The director went on to assert that Scientology and psychiatry are opposed, adding that the actress' father 'was a psychologist in Australia.'

'Miscavige was afraid that Nicole Kidman was slowly taking Tom away from the church,' Gibney continued. 'There was a concerted effort to get him back. One of the things they did was... at Tom's behest, Marty Rathbun testifies in the film, that David Miscavige requested Marty to go and tap Nicole Kidman's phone.'

Cruise's attorney, however, told E! News regarding the claims of wiretapping: 'Tom Cruise did not hire any private investigator to spy on or investigate Nicole Kidman in any way. Nor did he ask the Church of Scientology to do that. Any statement to the contrary is provably false.'

Gibney's film claims that Kidman, who was raised Catholic, convinced Cruise to distance himself from the Church of Scientology between 1992 and 2001.

It also alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding.

Rathbun suggests, in the film, this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart began.

Gibney went on to claim during Monday's panel: 'The other, more pernicious thing that happened was that they tried to turn their two kids against Nicole, which is really the most horrifying thing.

'They succeeded, so much so that we have people who told us that they began to refer to their mother privately as a suppressive person... and then they were told, "Now listen, the way you deal with suppressive people is, don't let on to them that you know that they're a suppressive person. So, be nice, smile, but be aware that this person is more dangerous and damaging than anything you could possibly believe."'

Rinder, a former high ranking member of the church, went on to offer his own views on the claims: 'The circumstances surrounding that and his description of what happened, rings so true. 

'The mind-set of Nicole isn't really with the program so here we go back to disconnection again, except it's got a nicer name, it doesn't exactly get presented that way to Tom Cruise.' 

'It's "Tom, she's not good for you, you better straighten out here and get your life in order and we'll help you,"' he continued. 'That dictatorial control and efforts to control people's lives is really the ebb and flow of the Church of Scientology... There are all sorts of examples like that.'

Back in 2012 Maureen Orth wrote a piece making similar claims about Kidman and Cruise's children being turned against the actress. At the time the church denied the claims made by the Vanity Fair piece. 

Cruise and Kidman share two adopted children together, Isabella, 22, and Conor, 20. 

Meanwhile, during Monday's panel Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church. 

'The reason we are calling out Cruise and Travolta is they have the capacity, the power, to change it. There are only two ways that you can address the abuses that are going on in Scientology,' Wright said.

Concerns: Kidman (pictured with Cruise in 2001) was listed as a 'Potential Trouble Source' because her father was a psychologist in Australia 

'One is to re-examine the tax exemption. But some of those celebrity megaphones, if they were turned around in the other direction they could make a difference. They should make a difference. I'd like to see Tom Cruise stand up and say it's time for David Miscavige to answer his accusers.' 

The Church Of Scientology responded belatedly to DailyMail.com's request for comment and denied all allegations made by the film and the filmmakers, including allegations of wiretapping, and claims made about David Miscavige.

The church also characterized Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder, and Alex Gibney as biased and unreliable sources. 

Before the controversial documentary's first screening, HBO hired 160 lawyers to look through the film. It is expected to air on the channel on March 29.

In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Gibney and his sources in Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month.

It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources.

And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to offer a counter point of view.

In addition, the church released a statement to Us Weekly, stating: 'This is not a film that is any way objective about Scientology. It is propaganda... Freedom of the press is not freedom to lie. The Church of Scientology has long fought against the kind of bigotry and religious hatred that Mr. Gibney and co-producer Lawrence Wright aim to incite. To fit their anti-religious agenda, they scraped the bottom of the barrel to cherry-pick a tiny collection of deadbeats.'  

Despite the furor surrounding the production, Gibney hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into Scientology.

He told Variety magazine: 'We hope that this film and Larry's book will start the process where more media will say well we don't care anymore. We're going to pursue this no matter what. 

According to the credits at the end of the film, Cruise and Kidman refused to be interviewed.  

The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.
