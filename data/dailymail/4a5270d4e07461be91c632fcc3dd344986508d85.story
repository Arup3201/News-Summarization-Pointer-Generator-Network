The heritage-listed Engineers' Arms Hotel of Maryborough in south-east Queensland is one of the oldest and most distinctive hotels in town with a wonderful apartment currently on the market.

Situated in the heart of Maryborough and just 250 kilometres from Brisbane or 37 kilometres from Harvey Bay and Fraser Island, the Engineers Arms presents a great lifestyle opportunity.

After a significant refurbishment, the iconic building has operated as a boarding house, restaurant, community hall, candy shop and a bed and breakfast since ceasing operations in 1951.

But a hauntingly sad yet historic tale, believed to have haunted the Dillane family who had just moved into a beautiful newly formed location on March Street of Maryborough in 1870.

Irish immigrants Thomas Dillane and his wife Anne Dunne were newly-weds who were starting a family in their new town.

Shortly after, the pair took up the leasehold on the first Engineers Arms Hotel to run their own business.

The married couple welcomed their three sons Patrick James, Michael Joseph, and Thomas David but sadly lost their infant Thomas David at eight months after complications caused by teething just a few years after they opened the original hotel in 1870.

They welcomed their first daughter Margaret Mary in 1876 but tragedy struck once more when Thomas passed away in September 1877 from consumption at the age of 45.

With extensive renovation of the first floor apartment and rooms open to the wrap around verandah, the en-suite bedroom has a walk-in robe, dressing room and a fully renovated bathroom

A delightful blend of 1800's with every modern touch; done with a great eye for detail and respect for history

With her husband gone, Anne struggled to raise her family alone so she put the hotel on lease and took over as head of household before her eldest son, Patrick died after his heart stopped at the age of 17.

Anne couldn't handle the death around her family so she packed her bags and boarded a ship to Dublin, Ireland with her remaining children, Michael and Margaret to start a new life, putting the family tragedy behind.

But within one month, her daughter Margaret passed away and Anne and Michael returned to Maryborough and took their bar back in 1891.

The kitchen is open plan to the dining area and is a delight with a completely new fit-out, including a walk-in pantry and internal laundry 

The apartment boasts a wonderful entry through an internal staircase, which connects to a central corridor to the large entertainment and living area

With extensive renovation, the apartment comes with a modern touch, including new electrical wiring, paintwork and floor coverings

Maryborough suffered its worst flood in history in 1893 when it rose over 12 metres and the water engulfed the hotel where they later found Anne's body. With Michael left, unfortunately, he died a year later at the age of 22 from kidney disease.

Despite the unfortunate lives of the Dillane family, the property has beautifully maintained so much of its fine details of the building dating back to the 1870s.

The apartment is positioned above five separate tenancies, including fashion, cafe restaurant, hairdresser and a boutique liquor store that will deliver a great investment in return.

The hotel is built to the property boundary of an acute angled block, giving it a V-shaped plan, truncated at the corner.

With extensive renovation, the apartment comes with a modern touch, including new electrical wiring, paintwork and floor coverings but done with a great eye for detail and respect for history.

Either side of the corridor, there is a number of bedrooms which leads to an opened kitchen dining room with a walk-in pantry and an internal laundry.

The  en-suite bedroom has a walk-in robe, dressing room and a fully renovated bathroom.
