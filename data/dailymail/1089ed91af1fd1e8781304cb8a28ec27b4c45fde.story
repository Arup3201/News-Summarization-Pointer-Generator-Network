A former finance boss at Sandwell Council who stole nearly £30,000 from a fund for children with special needs has been spared jail.

Debt-ridden David Pottinger, 37, claimed cash from the fund after he got into money troubles following a lengthy divorce, a court heard.

Pottinger, a qualified accountant, made off with £29,118 in a string of 32 separate fraudulent transactions before he was caught.

The council officer then tried to implicate an innocent colleague in the scam, by using his name to cover the tracks of the theft.

Yesterday he was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 150 unpaid work after admitting seven charges of fraud by abuse of position.

The court heard the father-of-one had become 'desperate' as he was being chased by 13 payday loan firms. 

Passing sentence Recorder Sandra Bristoll said Potting had: 'Abused his position of trust with the council.'

She added: 'This was a sophisticated and well planned fraud involving two fraudulent transactions amounting to £29,118.

'The fact that you used a colleagues name to try and cover up the crime is an aggravating feature.'

Mark Jackson, prosecuting, told the court that Pottinger, who worked for Sandwell Borough Council for 12 years, was rumbled when a colleague notices the 'unusual' transactions.

He said payments went out from the fund to children who did not exist to cover fake transport costs.

Mukhtar Ubli, defending, told the court Pottinger had become 'desperate' and was being chased by a series of loan firms.

Speaking after the case Sandwell Council deputy leader Coun Steve Eling said: 'David Pottinger tried to defraud the council and he didn't get away with it.

'This was a contemptible crime carried out by a trusted member of staff. He has rightfully been convicted.

'We acted immediately when we uncovered the fraud and I'm glad to say it was stopped at a relatively early stage so there is no impact on people who use the service.

Pottinger was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 150 unpaid work after admitting seven charges of fraud by abuse of position at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) 

'It's important to recognise that many council employees are in positions that require the highest level of trust and integrity.

'It's extremely disappointing on the rare occasions when this is broken. We won't hesitate to act when we find this sort of wrongdoing.

'Any employee thinking of defrauding the public needs to understand that they will be caught.
