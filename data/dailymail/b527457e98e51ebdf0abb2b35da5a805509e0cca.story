A Florida man shot and
killed a 400-pound black bear after it broke into his
house two nights in a row to get to a bag of dog food.

'I felt in danger enough that since it wouldn't leave I had
to shoot it,' said Victor Peters of Lady Lake of the Wednesday
night incident in a video interview posted online by the Orlando
Sentinel.

Killing a bear in Florida is illegal and Mr Peters could now face charges.

The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation will be handing the case to prosecutors early this week when they will decide whether to take the issue further.

Peters’ porch was trashed after the bear’s first break-in. On the second occasion he was armed and ready. This picture shows the outline of the bear after it was shot and killed, laying on the living room floor

Victor Peters, 64, was forced to shoot and kill a black bear - but not before it wrecked his home

The bear knocked over furniture and smashed widows. Killing a bear in Florida is illegal and prosecutors will be examining the case laster this week

'It sounds like he did what he could do to try to keep the
bear from coming back,' Workman said. 'We're looking at all
sides to make the best decision.'

Bears and humans cross paths, occasionally fatally for the
animals, in Central Florida where sprawling subdivisions have
sprung up in former bear habitat and along their natural
corridors around the Ocala National Forest.

In a previous case this year, seven bears were euthanized in
April by wildlife officers in the search for the culprit after
one grabbed a Lake Mary woman by the head outside her home.

Peters, whose home is about 50 miles northwest of Orlando,
called 911 on Tuesday evening after the bear entered his
glassed-in porch by smashing out the metal-framed windows to get
the dog food, Workman said.

At the direction of wildlife officers, Peters removed the
dog food from his porch, but the bear returned on Wednesday
evening.

Peters, in the video interview on Friday, said he was
prepared with a loaded rifle. When the bear ignored his yells
and kept approaching, Peters said he shot the bear in the head
from a distance of 10 feet.

Workman said the adult male bear was one of the biggest he
has seen in the area.
