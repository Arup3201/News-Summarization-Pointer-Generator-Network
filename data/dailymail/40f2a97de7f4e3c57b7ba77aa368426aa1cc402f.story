A work of art is nothing unless it has been recreated in Lego. 

Now, one artist has immortalised perhaps the most difficult, mind-bending masterpieces of them all: MC Escher’s Relativity.

The iconic print, with its gravity-defying stairs, bridges and passageways, depicts a world in which normal physical laws do not apply.

Riccardo Zangelmi used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3D model of MC Escher's 'Relativity' over 15 days

The print depicts a world in which there are three sources of gravity and sixteen characters who live in different 'gravity wells'.

There are seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity wells.

This means that, for example, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally.

This complex structure didn’t stop Italian Riccardo Zangelmi from painstakingly recreating the impossible-looking world.

Mr Zangelmi used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3D model over the course of 15 days for the Foundation Magnani in Italy.

The
piece will be on display for four months during an exhibition in Parma,
Italy, dedicated to Escher, alongside his original works.

Dutch artist Escher is best known for his mathematical inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints.

He also produced impossible architectural constructions and tessellations that often explore the theme of infinity.

This isn’t the first time that he has captured the imagination of Lego artists.

Two years ago, Andrew Lipson from Cambridge carefully assembled thousands of Lego bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible Escher pieces.

Mr Lipson would not reveal how he managed to achieve the seemingly impossible angles and mind-boggling perspectives found in his creations.

This isn't the first time that he has captured the imagination of Lego artists. Two years ago, Andrew Lipson from Cambridge carefully assembled thousands of Lego bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible Escher pieces including 'Balcony' (pictured)

However, he confirmed that he did not used glue or any other adhesive to keep the Lego blocks in place.

‘The whole problem with 'Balcony' was figuring out exactly what distortion Escher had used and reversing it to get an undistorted view of his picture,’ he said.

'I then had to build a Lego copy of that and then distort a photograph of the result.’

MC Escher was born in Leeuwarden in the Netherlands in 1924.

By the time he died in 1974 his drawings of impossible structures made him one of the most celebrated graphic artists of the 20th Century.
