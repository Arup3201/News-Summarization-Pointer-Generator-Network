A West Virginia man suspected in four killings in separate shootings was discovered dead in his truck of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a nine-hour manhunt, police said Monday.

Jody Lee Hunt, 39, of Westover was found in a clearing in the woods in the southern part of Monongalia County, inside his 2011 Ford F-150, according to state police. 

The vehicle and body were found about 7 pm in 'a power line right of way,' spokesman Lt. Dennis Johnson said.

Hunt was wanted in two shootings in the Westover area and another in the Cheat Lake area in Monongalia County, spokesman Lt. Michael Baylous said. Medical officials will work to confirm the identity of the body, he said.

Officials said they would not release further information Monday night. On Tuesday, investigators at each of the three crime scenes will 'sit down and piece all those puzzle pieces together and find out how this all happened,' Baylous said.

Suspect: Police have found the body of Jody Hunt, 39, who is suspected of killing four people in three shootings in West Virginia on Monday

Sharon Berkshire, 39, was killed by a man police believe may have been Jody Hunt, against whom Berkshire had filed a domestic abuse case last month

Into Monday evening, state and local police had fanned out in search of Hunt, who was believed to be driving a 2011 Ford F-150 extended cab truck with license plate OLK 303.

The truck reportedly has a sticker reading 'Rough Country' in the back window and a Black Tonneau cover over the bed, reports the station. 

State police spokesman Lt Michael Baylous identified the two victims killed in the Cheat Lake area as  Berkshire of Westover, as well as Michael David Frum, 28. They were found inside a home.

The third identified victim, Doug Brady, was found dead inside his Westover business, Doug's Towing.

A November 7 Facebook post from Berkshire appears to show the very same truck Hunt is believed to have been driving, along with the words, 'New ride for this girl !!!!'

According to Monongalia County Circuit Court records, Berkshire filed a domestic violence case against Hunt some time last month. 

Unfortunately, here efforts appear to have come too late. Court records also indicated there were no protective orders currently in place for Berkshire.  

'My actions were not right nor were the actions of those who tried to tear me down and take from me. This was not the plan but a struggle to see that those who strives to hurt me received their fair pay of hurt like I received...You will not hurt me any more. You will not destroy my soul and heart as you tried so hard to do.' 

Another post appeared later:

'I hope that everyone takes the words I love you seriously. Be honest with the one you are with. No need for a game. You either want them or u don't. Just tell them no need to lead there heart on. I'm so sorry for my actions today and the lives I've effected. I'm so tired of the wrong doers getting by with all of it. No need for games. Life is short. Love the one you are with [sic].'
