Richard Attenborough's son has revealed how his father 'was obviously not the same man' after suffering a terrible fall at his home in 2008.

Theatre director Michael Attenborough, 65, described his father, who died on Sunday aged 90, as: 'Quite simply my hero; my supporter, my counsellor, my friend.'

But he said his beloved parent changed beyond recognition after falling down the stairs six years ago.

'He hit his head very badly and I have no idea how he survived', he told the Mirror.  'When he emerged after 18 months in hospital, he was obviously not the same man.'

Lord 
Attenborough's family chose not to reveal how badly he had suffered as a
 result of the accident, which, his son said today, left the legendary 
director unable to read or write.

He said: 'The two things it was terrible to take away from my dad were his activity and articulation.'

The Oscar-winning director, who died on Sunday five days before his 91st birthday, was able to say a few words, including his son's name, but no more than that, he said.

As
 a result, he said, his father suffered huge frustration for more than 
four years, before becoming more resigned in the last 18 months of his 
life.

Lord Attenborough's son, who has a younger sister, Charlotte, and whose other sister, Jane, died aged 49 in the 2004 tsunami, said the family's focus was now on Sheila, Lady Attenborough, 92.

He said they were making sure she was surrounded by relatives in an attempt to cushion her from the shock of losing the husband she spent 74 years with.

A private family funeral will be held in the next week, while a more public memorial service will take place in November.

told his loved ones he felt as though he was ‘trapped in purgatory’ during his final months, it emerged yesterday.

Lord Attenborough's son's comments came as the film director's friend, producer Anthony Haas, revealed that he was glad the actor and director had finally escaped the misery of his confined existence.

Mr Haas, 64, said he used to visit Lord 
Attenborough every week at the nursing home in North-West London where 
he lived with his wife Sheila Sim, 92, but saw his friend’s health 
decline in recent months.

The film legend, pictured with his wife in 2001, had been confined to a wheelchair since falling down stairs six years ago and became increasingly frustrated with his inability to move

He added: ‘My immense sadness at his death is tinged with an element of relief that his suffering is finally at an end.

'He was increasingly trapped in his own body. He told me he felt as if he was trapped in purgatory.

‘Despite
 his great humour and spirit, you could see he found it increasingly 
frustrating. Shortly before his death he was no longer able to have many
 visitors.

'Mentally he was all there, but it became difficult for him to
 communicate properly and that was causing him pain.’

Mr
 Haas said the last decade of Lord Attenborough’s life was ‘tinged with 
immense sadness’ caused by the loss of his eldest daughter Jane Holland,
 49, and 15-year-old granddaughter Lucy in the Indian Ocean tsunami in 
2004.

He said: 
‘You never recover from something like that. It was devastating for the 
whole family. He lived with that tragedy for his last years, but he had 
an irrepressible spirit.

Sir Ben Kingsley, pictured with Lord Attenborough at the 1982 Academy Awards, who played the title role in Oscar-winning Gandhi, said he would 'miss him dearly'

‘He was one of the most extraordinary, passionate people I will ever have the pleasure to know.’

His 
comments came as Lord Attenborough’s friend and fellow filmmaker Lord 
Puttnam led tributes to the star, affectionately called ‘Dickie’ by 
colleagues and fans.

He said he was ‘utterly irreplaceable’, adding: ‘A massively gifted man, he was also the best possible friend.

‘This
 is a most remarkable man who, when you string together the things he 
did, the things he helped, the things he salvaged, it’s mind-boggling 
the list of decent, good things he did for Britain.’

Former
 TV executive Lord Grade, who worked with Lord Attenborough at Channel 4
 when he chaired the broadcaster in the 1980s, paid tribute to his 
‘phenomenal’ energy and compassion.

Lord Attenborough’s acting credits included Brighton Rock, The Great Escape, 10 Rillington Place and Jurassic Park.

Sir Ben Kingsley, who played the title role in Gandhi, said he would ‘miss him dearly’. He added: ‘Richard Attenborough trusted me with the crucial and central task of bringing to life a dream it took him 20 years to bring to fruition.

‘When he gave me the part of Gandhi it was with great grace and joy. He placed in me an absolute trust and in turn I placed an absolute trust in him and grew to love him.’

Jurassic Park director Steven Spielberg, pictured with Lord Attenborough in 1993, said: 'He was a dear friend and I am standing in an endless line of those who completely adored him'

Jurassic Park director Steven Spielberg said: ‘He was a dear friend and I am standing in an endless line of those who completely adored him.’ Lord Attenborough had been in a wheelchair since 2008, when he fell down a flight of stairs and hit his head on a window ledge, leaving him in a coma for several days.

Soon after he joked about the incident, saying: ‘I scared the living daylights out of Sheila, and had some time in hospital. They were all fussing around.’

But he never fully recovered and was left with slurred speech and unable to walk. He joined his wife in the Denville Hall care home for elderly entertainers, which they helped to found, last year.

They had met at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London when they co-starred in a production of The Lady With The Lamp, and married in 1945.

Lord Attenborough made his film debut aged 18 in Noel Coward’s 1942 naval movie In Which We Serve. He made his directing debut in 1969 with Oh! What A Lovely War and went on to win four Baftas and four Golden Globes.
