Muslim pupils must study two religions under government plans to tackle extremism in schools following the Trojan Horse plot.

Changes to religious studies qualifications are expected to be set out by ministers next week when the subject criteria for GCSEs is published.

Faith schools are likely to see the biggest impact as they can currently choose to teach their own religion and disregard others.

Under new government plans to tackle extremism in schools, Muslim pupils will have to study two religions

As well as studying at least two religions, pupils will also be expected to debate moral dilemmas in the context of religious beliefs in class.

The modifications to lessons comes after the alleged Trojan Horse plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools in Birmingham.

It was originally sparked by a leaked letter in March this year - now widely believed to be a hoax - which alleged to be from Islamists in the city plotting to seize control of a number of school governing bodies.

Birmingham City Council revealed a month later that it had received 'hundreds' of allegations of similar school takeover plots - some dating back 20 years.

Tahir Alam, chairman of the Park View Education Trust which runs six schools in the city, resigned after he was found to have written a detailed blueprint in 2007 for the radical 'Islamisation' of secular state schools. 

The government hopes by tweaking religious studies lesson criteria it will help tackle cultural isolationism and extremism.

But despite this, schools will be able to decide how much teaching time to give each faith - so pupils could spend three quarters of the course studying one faith and just a quarter on the other.

Teachers will also have to give sharper focus to the study of faith and steer away from the current method of dividing studies into philosophy and ethics. 

While teenagers will be expected to answer questions on ethics with reference to religious beliefs.

The new syllabus will also have an extra option that places more emphasis on the study of religious texts, practices and sources of authority.

However, A-level students will continue to be able to study only one religion if they choose under the new criteria. 

The amendments have been broadly welcomed by the Church of England.

Reverend Nigel Genders, the Church of England's chief education officer, told The Times: 'Studying two religions with a further detailed text based study for one of the religions at GCSE will promote depth and breadth and equip students to be religiously literate in today's world.'

Andrew Copson, chief executive of the British Humanist Association, also told the paper: 'It is hugely important that all young people learn about the full range of different religious and non-religious beliefs that are common in society today.

'Such learning makes a vital contribution to respect and tolerance of individuals with different beliefs.'

Mr Copson added that the change is welcome progress but does not go as far as he would have liked.

Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plot was 'planned and orchestrated' attempt to control school boards

The Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year, when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools.

The letter prompted Department for Education inspectors to go into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen. 

Whistleblowers at Park View claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body.

It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school.

The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area.

Following inspections, Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs in July that there had been a 'planned and orchestrated' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city.

He told the Education Select Committee said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated.

'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target. They believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies.

'They believed governing boards couldn't take place in the normal way. They believed all that was planned and orchestrated. This was all in Birmingham.'

When asked by MPs if pupils had been radicalised in the schools, Sir Michael replied: 'We didn't see that. The issue of extremism was outside of our remit.'

The Ofsted chief inspector told MPs: 'What we did see was the promotion of a culture, which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism.'
