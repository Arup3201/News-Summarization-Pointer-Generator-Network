When Trish Staine had back pains she put it down to her two-hour training session for a half-marathon, but when she went to the hospital for a check up she was told she was in labor.

Five minutes after the 33-year-old from Duluth, Minnesota, was told she was pregnant, her daughter was born.

The foster-mother, who already has two children with her husband, said she had always been skeptical about women claiming they didn't know they were pregnant - until it happened to her.

Shock: Trish Staine with new daughter Mira, or Miracle, who made her unexpected arrival on Monday

Medical staff believe the baby, who was born at 3.25pm on Monday, arrived about five weeks early.

Mrs Staine, who had been training for the Grandma's half-marathon on June 22, said she experienced no pregnancy symptoms and her husband, John, had also had a vasectomy.

'I didn't gain any weight. I 
had my period. I had no idea,' she told WDIO.

When she went into labor on Monday, she thought she had hurt her back while training on a hill in Glenwood.

It wasn't until the pain became severe that she was taken by ambulance to St Mary's hospital.

'In the ER, they found a fetal 
heartbeat. I was like, "No no no. There's no way I'm pregnant". But they 
rushed me up to the birthing center, and five minutes after I got into 
my room, she was born,' Mrs Staine said.

Expanding family: Foster carer John Staine could not believe it when doctors said his wife had just had a baby

Her daughter, who has been named Mira, short for Miracle, weighed 6lb 6oz and, although her blood sugar was low, she was healthy.

Mr Staine, a Navy veteran who has three sons from a previous relationship, first heard that he was a father again when he arrived at the hospital.

When doctors told him he had a daughter, he said: 'Whose baby is that? It’s not possible,' Mr Staine told Duluth News Tribune.

However, for every 1,000 vasectomies carried out in the U.S. 11 per cent will fail, resulting in unexpected pregnancies.

The new father, who runs the Genesis Project with his wife, which helps young men aged 17 to 21 move from foster care to independent living, said Mrs Staine had been in a lot of pain on Monday.

He recalled her crying in pain earlier in the day, but later she was 'screaming, crying and yelling out,' Mr Staine said.

Because she had run for about nine miles the previous day, the couple thought she had trapped a nerve, or maybe had a kidney stone.

She had taken pain relief, tried soaking her muscles in the bath but the pain became more intense.

Finally Mr Staine, 47, who was at a medical center for a health check up, asked their children to get her to a hospital.

When he arrived later Mr Staine said that he pinched the doctor who told him his wife had been in labor, adding: 'It was like a dream. I wanted to make sure it was real.'

He added that Mrs Staine had showed no signs of pregnancy, adding that his wife had even appeared to lose weight as she trained for the marathon.

Fortunately, the couple have a large six-bedroom house to accommodate their children and foster children.

They started the Genesis Project in 2010 because, as Mr Staine told Lake Voice News: 'If a kid is in trouble and needs a place to stay, something to eat, or a positive view of life, they can come to me.'

When asked if his wife would still be running in the half-marathon later this month, he said: 'We paid for [the entry fee]. They’ve already cashed the check.'
