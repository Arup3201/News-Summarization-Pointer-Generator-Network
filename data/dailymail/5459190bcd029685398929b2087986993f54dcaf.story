Keeping each other warm: These youngsters are around 40 to 50 days old

Speckled with snow, the tiny chicks, keep close to their mothers and fathers in the midst of the icy blast. 

The tiny chicks bare an uncanny resemblance to  Mumbles, from the Bafta winning movie Happy Feet.

In the animated film, Mumble's is cast as an outsider because he has a terrible singing.

Emperor penguins famously trek up to 75 miles over the ice to reach their breeding colony.

Here the female penguin lays a single egg and hand it over to the male to cradle on his feet.

This handover must be done without the egg once touching the ground otherwise the chick inside would die from the freezing temperatures. 

The female then makes the long trek back to the sea to feed. 

The male is left to withstand the Antarctic cold for more than two months - during which time he will eat nothing - to protect his egg from the extreme cold. 

When the female returns she brings with her their now hatched chick's first meal - finding her mate and young among the crowd thanks to his vocal call.

She takes over caring for the chick while he makes the arduous journey to the sea.

They then take it in turns to care for their chick and forage at sea.

When the youngsters are around 45-50 days old they huddle together to form a crèche while both parents head out to sea - returning periodically to feed their chicks before they are old enough to fend for themselves.
