A decade ago, Deborah Maddison’s father gave her his kidney, saving her when she had hours left to live.

Now, the model is getting a second gift of life – from her mother, who has stepped in as an organ donor after the first transplant started to fail.

Audrey Maddison, 52, a full-time carer who has two other daughters, said of Deborah: ‘She’s incredible. If we can give her a better quality of life, of course we will.

Takes things in her stride: Deborah is determined to continue her modelling career despite suffering from osteoporosis, high blood pressure and kidney problems

‘Any parent would do the same. You do anything for your kids.’

When Miss Maddison, 26, fell ill in 
2003, a GP said it was indigestion. But tests showed she was anaemic and
her organs were shutting down.

She had a blood transfusion and spent
three months on dialysis, but in May 2003 was taken to hospital with 
acute kidney failure.

She was given only two hours to live unless she had a transplant.

Deborah was told she would have died in two hours if she hadn't received an emergency transplant at Leicester General Hospital in 2003

Miss Maddison hopes to continue with her modelling career after her next transplant

Her father Alan, 57, a magistrate’s 
clerk, proved a good match and gave her his left kidney in an operation 
at Leicester General Hospital.

Miss Maddison said: ‘It was bizarre 
at first because they thought it was indigestion. But they did some more
tests and found my kidneys had shrivelled to nothing.

‘They told me I had two hours to live if we didn’t get to Leicester Hospital.’

The surgery was a success but a year 
later she was diagnosed with heart problems, high blood pressure and 
osteoporosis – leaving her with the skeletal structure of a 90-year-old.

However, she refused to let illness stop her modelling and has reached the finals of two swimwear competitions.

Then, just before Christmas, doctors said her father’s donated kidney was failing.

Her second chance came when her mother stepped in.

Tests showed she was a perfect match and the surgery is due to take place next month.

Miss Maddison, of Sleaford, 
Lincolnshire, said: ‘I am scared of what’s ahead but have amazing 
friends and family who help me stay strong.’

She is appealing for people to join the National Organ Donation Register and help save other lives.
