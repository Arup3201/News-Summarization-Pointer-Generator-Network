An apartment building in a Virginia suburb of Washington D.C. has experience more than two dozen suspected arson fires in the past 10 months, and on Thursday authorities arrested an unlikely suspect: A 74-year-old woman who's lived in the building for more than 30 years.

Shirley Vigneau was arrested Thursday after she was seen on surveillance footage walking out of a trash room on the seventh floor of the Stratford building in Alexandria where she allegedly started a fire on Wednesday evening.

According to authorities, Vigneau used papers to start the blaze before quickly leaving the trash room.

On Thursday, officers from the Alexandria Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives executed a search warrant at Vigneau's apartment, and ultimately took her into custody.

'Most fires occurs after midnight when residents were sleeping, 
resulting in numerous evacuations of the building,' ATF Agent Thomas 
Faison told WJLA.

In all, authorities suspect Vigneau started 25 fires over the past 10 months.

'There were no injuries reported, but these fires caused extensive fear 
and anxiety on the part of the residents of the complex,' Alexandria 
police said in a statement Thursday.

One resident, who didn't want to be identified, told the station that she knew about the fires, but she was shocked to learn that one of her neighbors is responsible for starting them

'It's been annoying,' said the unnamed resident. 'It's just really been a
 lot. It's just really, really been a nuisance...and it's been dangerous
 for people living here.'

The resident says she can recall several times when she and her neighbors were forced to evacuate the building late at night, after a fire alarm went off.Â 

Vigneau was questioned by investigators and admitted to starting the fires. She was booked into the Alexandria Sheriff's Office Detention Center on Thursday and faces multiple counts of arson and possibly other crimes.

Authorities say the arrest was the result of a joint, 10-month investigation between the ATF and Alexandria Fire Department.
