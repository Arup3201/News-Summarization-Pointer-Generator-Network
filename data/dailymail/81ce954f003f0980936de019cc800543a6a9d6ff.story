Hundreds of wild horses have been rounded up and wrestled to the ground as part of a 400-year-old Spanish festival.

The Rapa Das Bestas, translated as Shearing Of The Beasts, sees horses herded down from the mountains in northwestern Spain to be trimmed and groomed.

Thousands of visitors descended on the small village of Sabucedo this weekend and endured temperatures of almost 40C to witness the traditional spectacle.

Battle: Aloitadores, or 'fighters' struggle to hold onto a wild horse during the Rapa Das Bestas

Herd: 500 horses were herded down from the Galicia mountains to be trimmed in the 400-year-old festival

Dangerous: One of the local fighters risks being trampled as he wrestles a horse to the ground

Spectacle: Thousands of people attended the three-day festival as 'fighters' wrestled with wild horses

The festival, which has attracted 
criticism from animal rights campaigners in the past, began as a way of 
checking the horses for disease and cutting their hair to keep them cool
in the hottest months.

But it has turned into a tradition that now attracts thousands of people to the small village, about 40kms from Santiago de Compostela.

The horses come from the mountains of Galicia, where they roam free for the rest of the year.

Over three days, about 30 local Aloitadores, or 'fighters', must do battle with the horses using nothing but their hands. No tools or ropes are permitted.

Tourist attraction: Thousands of people descend on the small village of Sabucedo to see the spectacle

Criticism: The festival, known as Shearing Of The Beasts, has been criticised in the past by animal rights campaigners but locals say it still serves a practical purpose to check on the health of the horses

Struggle: Three Aloitadores team up together to wrestle a horse to the ground where it is trimmed

Branded: As well as the trim, foals are also branded during the three-day festival

Family event: A woman and a young boy grab a foal during the Rapa Das Bestas

Three men are needed for each horse. 
One jumps on the horse's back while another takes hold of its neck. The 
third grabs the tail.

They then risk being trampled or crushed as they  wrestle the horse to floor in order to shear it and trim its mane and tail.

Younger horses that have not previously been tagged are also branded.

The festival begins on the first 
Saturday in July, and starts with an early morning mass, prior to the 
herders heading off at 7am, and goes on into the Monday.

Tradition: The festival is 400-years-old and always takes place on the first weekend in July

Trim: Once on the ground, the horses have their mane and tails cut to keep them cool in the hot summer

Herd: Once the festival is over the horses are taken back to the mountains where they roam free

This year, 500 horses will be sheared - more than the 350 involved in the 2012 festival - before being herded back to the mountains today.

Organisers delayed the start of yesterday's event as temperatures soared because of fears about the health of the horses and the fighters.

In 2007, the festival was declared a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest by the Spanish General Secretariat of Tourism.
