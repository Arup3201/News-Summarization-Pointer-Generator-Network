A mother-of-three died after a gallstone removal operation was cancelled twice because she had head lice, an inquest heard.

Lindsay Swanson, 34, was sent home by staff at Leicester General Hospital because the parasites could have increased the risk of infection, and because she had a high heart rate.

Her partner told an inquest Ms Swanson was 'very upset' at the decision - but doctors have stood by it, insisting the operation would not have saved Ms Swanson's life.

Death: Lindsay Swanson was sent home from two operations because she had head lice, an inquest heard

The inquest at Leicester Town Hall heard Ms Swanson was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, in October 2012.

Her illness was triggered by gallstones and its severity put her among the worst-affected 20 per cent of patients - half of whom die, the hearing was told.

She was kept in hospital for a week before being discharged and told an operation would take place within six weeks.

But it was only in February 2013, after her weight had almost halved from 20st 13lbs to 12st 2lbs, that she returned to the hospital for a pre-operative assessment.

There she was told she could not have the operation the next day as planned because of her head lice and high heart rate, the inquest was told.

Treatment: Staff at Leicester General Hospital defended the decision and said it could have caused infection

Her distraught partner Lee Dunning, who lived with her in Leicester, said: 'The doctors told us they were not going to operate because Lindsay had head lice.

'She was very upset. We went home. I treated her hair and it started to fall out. She was not well at all and going downhill slowly.'

She returned to the hospital a month later but the operation was again cancelled, he said.

Then, on April 1, she was taken to A&E at the Leicester Royal Infirmary with severe pain.

She was transferred to Leicester General Hospital a month later but died on a high dependency unit on June 6.

One pre-operative assessment unit medic, whose name was given only as Dr Yazdiwe, said staff wanted to discuss the head lice with Ms Swanson's GP but she refused to give them permission. 

Dr Clare Brown, who was a senior surgeon at Leicester General Hospital in 2013, added: 'It is less than ideal to operate on somebody with severe lice infestation.'

She said the condition could have led to the scalp of having microscopic cuts from scratching, which could lead to infection.

Hearing: Ms Swanson's partner told the inquest at Leicester Town Hall she was 'very upset' at her treatment

Matthew Metcalf, a consultant bladder surgeon at the hospital, said the operation would not have saved Ms Swanson's life.

He said she was among the 20 per cent of patients in the high risk category who suffer severe pancreatitis.

'Half of those 20 per cent die and she was one of those,' he said. 'I don't think there was anything that could have been done that would have affected the outcome.'

He said it was the correct procedure for the hospital to have kept Lindsay in for a week after she was first admitted in October 2012.

She was treated for pain and after a scan showed she had gallstones, she was given painkillers and discharged.

Metcalf said there was no cure for severe pancreatitis, and all that could be done was to help the patient feel as comfortable as  possible.

The inquest continues and is expected to finish tomorrow.
