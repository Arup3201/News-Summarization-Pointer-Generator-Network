Some experts claim the male Y chromosome (pink) is on the way out. Yet DNA analysis has found a small set of unique genes have remained for 200 million years

Not only is the male chromosome here to stay - following exaggerated reports of its demise - it also plays a much wider role than first thought. 

Researchers from Massachusetts have discovered that despite its decay, the Y chromosome has preserved a small set of genes over millions of years that have ensured the survival of men.

And most have little, if any, role in sex determination or sperm production, according to the study.

Instead, they have been discovered to play a vital role in determining the differences between the sexes in terms of health and disease.

The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest these Y-linked genes could be contributing to differences in how susceptible the different sexes are to disease, and how severely it affects them.

Professor David Page, of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts, said: ‘This paper tells us not only is the Y chromosome here to stay but we need to take it seriously - and not just in the reproductive tract.

‘There are approximately a dozen genes conserved on the Y, expressed in cells and tissue types throughout the body.

‘These are genes involved in decoding and interpreting the entirety of the genome. How pervasive their effects are is a question we throw open to the field - and it's one we can no longer ignore.’

He said his research will allow his 
lab to change from proving the so-called 'rotting Y theorists' wrong.

Prior
 to 200 million years ago, when mammals were still relatively new on 
Earth, early versions of the X and Y sex chromosomes existed as 
interactive pairs.

With each generation, they swapped a few genes so that offspring were a genetic mix of their parents.

Then
 the gene for male features became fixed on the Y chromosome, and 
attracted other male-specific genes such as those controlling 
development of the testes, sperm and semen.

Many
 of these turned out to be harmful for females, so the X and Y stopped 
swapping genes and started to evolve separately. Today women have a 
matched pair of X chromosomes while men have an XY pair.

Because the X and Y cannot swap genes it is more difficult for mistakes in the Y chromosome to be corrected.

This has made it more sensitive to natural selection, and led to its degradation over time, scientists believe.

The 
belief was based on claims the chromosome's 1,400 genes had fallen in 
number to just 45 in the last 300 million years and this would carry on 
until it disappeared - making men extinct.

Over the past decade Professor Page and colleagues have been debunking this argument.

The
 loss of content on the Y is not in dispute, and Professor Page's own 
lab has found the chromosome retains only 19 of over 600 genes it once 
shared with its partner - the female X chromosome.

But by comparing 
the sequence of the human Y with that of the chimpanzee and the rhesus 
macaque, the researchers discovered the chromosome has lost only one ancestral gene 
over the past 25 million years.

The 
latest study maps the evolution of the Y chromosomes of five more 
distantly-related mammals - the marmoset, mouse, rat, bull and opossum.

This
 revealed a set of broadly expressed genes across all eight species - 
and such stability and conservation is no accident with each having a 
counterpart on the X.

Professor Page explained: ‘This is not just a random sampling of the Y's ancestral repertoire. This is an elite bunch of genes.’

Lab
 researcher Dr Winston Bellott added evolution is telling us these genes 
are really important for survival because they've been selected and 
purified over time.

The next step will be to determine what this set 
of Y genes is actually doing, which is not yet clear.

Cells in females 
which have two X chromosomes, and are referred to as XX, are subtly but 
fundamentally different from male XYs.

And they vary throughout the body in tissues and organs that show no obvious anatomic differentiation.

Dr Bellott said: ‘They're similar, but biologically different.

‘Yet we have cell biologists and biochemists actively studying cells without any idea whether the cells are XX or XY.

This is so fundamental to biology and biomedicine - and yet no one's really paid much attention to it.’

The
 researchers said what's needed is a biochemical catalogue of the 
differences between XX and XY cells - including variability in such 
processes as gene expression and protein production.

Professor Page said this pursuit could have enormous implications for human health.

Dr Bellot continued: ‘There's a clear need to move beyond a unisex model of biomedical
 research - which means we need to move beyond a unisex model of our 
understanding and treatment of disease.’ 

@highlight

Previous research claimed men could be extinct in five million years

@highlight

This is because the male chromosome Y has a small range of unique genes

@highlight

It's also lost 90% of genes it used to share with the female X chromosome

@highlight

Other chromosomes, by comparison, have thousands of unique genes

By comparing the human Y sequence with a chimpanzee's, researchers found it lost just one ancestral gene in the past 25 million years

They also found it plays a role in determining health differences between  the sexes
