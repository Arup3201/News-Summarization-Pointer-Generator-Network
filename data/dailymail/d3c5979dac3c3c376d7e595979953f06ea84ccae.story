A homeowner who downloaded a mobile phone app to keep an eye on her pet dog got the surprise of her life when she checked it - and caught a burglar in the act of ransacking her house.

The female homeowner named only as Melissa purchased a $150 Dropcam camera so she could link it to her mobile and check her dog was okay at her home in Washington while she was on vacation in Sun Valley, Idaho.

But when she received an alert at 5.30am from the motion-sensor app on her phone, she discovered a man was burgling her house, and she could watch everything he was doing.

Caught red-handed: The female homeowner named only as Melissa discovered a man burgling her house using an app on her mobile phone

The wonders of technology: The phone app was connected to a $150 motion-sensor camera which issued an alert to her mobile whenever it picked up a movement

She told KOMO: 'I saw an alert on my phone. I thought it was my neighbor because my neighbor was babysitting my dogs.

'It’s 5:30 in the morning. So I pull up the app and I see this guy out here and it’s definitely not my neighbor.

'I immediately called my neighbor and said, "Don’t go into my house!" She thought I was joking with her. I said, "No, I’m serious. There’s somebody in my house right now".'

The neighbour alerted the police and Melissa then watched as the burglar made his way through her home in Bellevue, Washington, on July 7, until officers arrived. 

Fast action: Melissa, who was on holiday at the time, was able to alert police that a man had broken into her home as he wandered through her garage perusing the family bikes

Discreet: The camera, shown on the wall next to cycle helmets, cost $150 but saved Melissa thousands of pounds after she alerted police to the burglary and officers disturbed the thief before he could take anything of value

No arrests were made but all the stolen items were recovered after the thief dropped them in his haste to escape.

Melissa, who lives at the property with her husband, said the app saved them thousands of pounds.

The camera was linked through a WiFi connection to a mobile application that sent her an alert any time motion was detected.

Bellevue Police Officer Carla Iafrate said: 'I always recommend to homeowners to do what they can to protect themselves and property from bad guys without putting themselves in harm’s way. It seems more and more people are researching home video systems, which is always helpful for law enforcement.'

Keeping checks: The camera is linked to Melissa's phone on a WiFi connection so she can check it wherever she is in the world
