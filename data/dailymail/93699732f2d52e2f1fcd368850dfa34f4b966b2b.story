Roberto Calderoli has reignited a race row after claiming he had been placed under a curse following his remarks comparing the country's first black minister to an orangutan

An Italian politician who faced calls to resign after comparing the country's first black minister to an orangutan has now claimed to have been put under a curse by her father.

Roberto Calderoli, deputy speaker of Italy's Senate and former minister of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, made the remarks  about Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge last year. 

After inviting widespread criticism and condemnation with the comments the politician said he had no intention of resigning and offered only a qualified apology.

Mr Calderoli, who is currently facing prosecution over the remarks, has now caused further outrage after he blamed a series of misfortunes on a curse and claimed he needs to find an exorcist.

According to The Telegraph, Mr Calderoli tweeted: 'I don't know if I should put an advert in the paper or call (Pope Francis) directly, but I must absolutely find an exorcist.'

The politician has said he has suffered a series of unfortunate events, including the death of his mother and six hospital operations, since Miss Kyenge's father led a ceremony in the Democractic Republic of Congo.

During the ceremony, which was filmed by gossip magazine Oggi, Clement Kyenge, 75, prayed to God to free Mr Calderoli of evil thoughts and attempted to contact the village's ancestors. 

Mr Calderoli told Oggi, as cited by The Independent, that the the video was 'unsettling'. 

According to The Local, Mr Calderoli said: 'I’ve never been superstitious but after this, things started happening more and more.'

Mr Kyenge has denied placing a curse on Mr Calderoli. 

After sparking outrage with the remarks in July last year, Mr Calderoli offered only a qualified apology.

He said: ‘I did not mean to offend and if minister Kyenge was offended I am sorry, but my comment was made within a much broader political speech that criticised the minister and her policies.'

After hours of nearly universal condemnation and extensive coverage by the international media, Mr Calderoli called Ms Kyenge in the evening to apologise directly. 

Cecile Kyenge, a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since 1983, became Integration Minister in April last year

She had done well to become a minister, he said, but ‘perhaps she should do it in her own country’.

Ms Kyenge is a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since 1983 and became a minister in April last year. 

Italy's then-Prime Minister Enrico Letta denounced the comments as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘beyond every limit’. 

Several ministers also said Mr Calderoli should step down from his Senate position.
