A British School pupil in Holland has been arrested after an anonymous post on an internet chat room threatened to unleash a mass shooting - causing more than 20 schools to be closed.

Police, in the city of Leiden, put all academic institutions for pupils between 12 and 16 years old on lockdown after they discovered the anonymous warning, made on 'dark net' web forum 4Chan.

The unknown student wrote on a message board in English that he or she was planning to storm a school with a Colt Defender gun and shoot a teacher and 'as many students as I can'.

The sex, age or identity of the arrested student is unclear, but he or she is understood to be attending The British School in nearby Voorschoten.

The writer went on to say he would also carry a note with an explanation for the attack when entering the school.

'Tomorrow, I will shoot my Dutch teacher, and as many
students as I can,' the writer states.

Leiden Mayor Henri Lenferink told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'It could just be a morbid joke but we don't want to take any risk.'

Two of the main schools, Da Vinci College and Driestar College, had 
police officers outside them on Monday morning, Dutch media said.

The British School in the Netherlands teaches the UK curriculum to students of more than 80 different nationalities, according to its website.

Threats: The threat was made on 'dark net' message forum 4Chan

in a statement, the authorities said: 'Police have received mention about a possible school shooting (being planned) in Leiden.'In light of this serious threat, it has been decided not to take any risk and therefore all middle schools will remain closed on Monday.'

It is not the first time internet site 4Chan has come under the spotlight following a shooting.

4chan is a controversial internet forum which allows users to post anonymous pictures and messages.

Known for its troublemaking, the anarchic message board was originally set up to discuss 
Japanese anime and manga.

But it has also become known for its 
lawlessness, obscene content and vindictive campaigns against paedophiles, animal abusers and suspected terrorist threats.

Users have also targeted the Church of Scientology.

Users can post without having to register or provide a name, and the 'Anonymous' tag has become a blanket term for online users acting 
collectively.

Last
week, the man accused of shooting two women in a suburban shopping mall
in Virginia was said to have announced the crime on a message board on 
the site a day earlier.

Neil MacInnis is accused of opening fire at the New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia, on April 12.

Two female victims remain in hospital with serious injuries.

Three minutes before the attack, a statement was posted on the online messaging board 4chan.

It said: 'Hey, it's time. My name is 
Neil Macinnis and I go to New River Community College in Christiansburg,
Virginia, ten minutes away from Virginia tech. I'm gonna give y'all the
details because the news never gets it right.

'Stevens 320 shotgun. Buck shots and slugs.'

'I'm a bit nervous because I've never really handled a shotgun but a few 
times with the Christiansburg police.'

'Anyways this is not a highscores 
game but actually a lesson (that's why I'm at school)...Wish me luck. An heroing [sic] is not necessary unless I
get f***ed out the ass. It's pretty busy.'

The term 'heroing' is believed to refer to committing suicide.

The 4chan message also provides a link to a website in Macinnis' name. It reveals he is a student at New River Community College which he says he 'loves'.
