Much of the country promises to be hot for the Fourth of July.

Temperatures will remain well 
into the 100s throughout the West, with some areas of the Southwest pushing above 110 
degrees.

Hot weather also will stretch into California, bringing summer 
conditions to the region after last week's unseasonably strong storm. The Weather Channel reported temperatures of more than 120F in Death Valley.

The
National Weather Service has issued heat advisories for the San 
Francisco Bay area, as well as parts of Illinois and Missouri.

A
rare combination of late snow from lingering storms and the high 
pressure heat wave saw ski resorts from California to Colorado open - 
with skiers wearing bikinis and Hawaiian shirts in an effort to beat the
heat.

Fireworks have been banned in many 
drought-stricken areas of the South after fears they could spark 
wildfires this Fourth of July weekend.

New Mexico, which is still battling 
the largest wildfire in its history, has prohibited fireworks on state 
and private wildlands.

Thousands
of Texas families have been left disappointed after fireworks were 
cancelled in dozens of towns and cities across the state.

And a Georgia county has swept fireworks off its store shelves after banning sales.

Some areas are even outlawing sparklers as drought grips much of the South and Southwest.

There
has been at least one court challenge over the bans, the LATimes 
reported today - but with temperatures soaring across the country this 
holiday weekend, most people are disappointed but compliant.Â 

'They know what could happen if fireworks did go on,' Texas city clerk Sherri Davis told the LATimes.

The heat was scorching in the West today, with a record of 118F baking Phoenix, Arizona, breaking a 10-year record.

A
power outtage meant that thousands of homes were suffering in the heat 
without air conditioning or fans. The Maricopa County Sheriff ordered 
bags of ice be sent to jails for inmates to use in any way they like - 
including to sit on, NBC reported.

The Northeast, however, was experiencing a cold front today with scattered rain and thunderstorms gripping New York.

The front is pushing west to east from Virginia through Maine. Morning and afternoon rain today was followed by evening clearing as the front moves offshore.

Tomorrow, the Fourth of July, is expected to be partly cloudy in the New York area.

Another area of precipitation will move through the Plains and may be accompanied by some strong thunderstorms and large hail.

Texas, however, will not receive any rain, prolonging an already devastating drought.

Temperatures in the Northeast will be in the 70s and 80s, while the Southeast and Southern Plains will see readings in the 90s and 100s.

Temperatures in the lower 48 states ranged Saturday from a morning low of 28 degrees at West Yellowstone, Montana, to a high of 113 degrees at Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona.

On the Fourth, scattered storms are set to bombard the mid-Atlantic states all the way westward to Ohio and Tennessee, with afternoon storms in the Southwest.
