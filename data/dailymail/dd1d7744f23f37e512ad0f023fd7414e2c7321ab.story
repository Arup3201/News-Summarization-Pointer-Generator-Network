Caroline Criado-Perez became the target of rape threats after leading a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note

A man has been arrested in connection with a barrage of hostile tweets a feminist campaigner received after persuading the Bank of England to put Jane Austen on a new bank note.

Caroline Criado-Perez received rape and death threats from Twitter users over the course of more than a day after she successfully campaigned for a woman's picture to be put on the note.

Scotland Yard said a 21-year-old was arrested today in Manchester on suspicion of harassment offences after officers in Camden, London, received a complaint of malicious communications on Thursday.

A campaign in her support, calling on Twitter to introduce a button to allow speedy reporting of abuse, has already been signed by 12,500 people and she has received support from MPs and celebrities.

Writer Caitlin Moran tweeted: 'For those who say, "why complain - just block?' on a big troll day, it can be 50 violent/rape messages an hour. Exhausting and upsetting.' 

There are also attempts being made to organise a boycott of the free social media network on August 4.

Ms Criado-Perez said: 'It's sadly not unusual to get this kind of abuse but I've never seen it get as intense or aggressive as this.

'It's infuriating that the price you pay for standing up for women is 24 hours of rape threats. We are showing that by standing together we can make a real difference.

'We made the Bank of England change its mind, we can do the same with Twitter.'

Ms Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist, organised a campaign which included a petition signed by more than 35,500 people after the Bank of England decided to replace Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on new £5 notes.

The move would have meant there were no women apart from the Queen on sterling bank notes.

Her campaign was a success, with an announcement by the Bank last week that the author Jane Austen will feature on the new £10 when it is introduced in 2017.

Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, is supporting Ms Criado Perez.

'What Caroline has had to deal with in the past day is not only disgusting, but criminal, she said.

'A quick look at Twitter this morning shows that women are not prepared to stand by and take this kind of abuse.

'Twitter needs to get its house in order, and fast.'

The campaigner tweeted this afternoon that she was planning to make a police statement.

Tony Wang, the general manager of Twitter UK, said that the company takes online abuse seriously.

He tweeted: 'We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report forms.

'Also, we're testing ways to simplify reporting, e.g. within a Tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web.

'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of our rules.'

A Twitter spokeswoman added: 'The ability to report individual tweets for abuse is currently available on Twitter for iPhone and we plan to bring this functionality to other platforms, including Android and the web.

'We don't comment on individual accounts.

'However, we have rules which people agree to abide by when they sign up to Twitter.

'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of our rules.

'We
 encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules
 by using one of our report forms: https://support.twitter.com/forms.'
