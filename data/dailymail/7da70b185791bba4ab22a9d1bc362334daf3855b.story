Celtic could be edged out of a £2million move for Cameron Jerome by rival interest from Norwich City.

The Parkhead outfit are understood to have made an offer for the Stoke City striker that his current club would be happy to accept.

As it stands, however, Jerome is thought to have a preference to continue his career in England. Norwich want the 28-year-old to spearhead their bid to return to the Barclays Premier League at the first time of asking and are hopeful of luring him to Carrow Road.

Celtic are also working to finalise a season-long loan deal for Ghana winger Wakaso Mubarak ahead of the deadline for their Champions League qualifier against Maribor.

The Rubin Kazan midfielder has emerged as a leading target for Parkhead boss Ronny Deila, with discussions taking place between the two clubs over the weekend.

Celtic hope to tie up the agreement on Monday, which would enable the 24-year-old — part of his nation’s World Cup squad — to be available for Wednesday’s first leg against the Slovenian champions.

Mubarak moved to Russia in a £4.5million switch from Espanyol last summer and his acquisition would provide Deila with a significant boost.

Inter Milan, Swansea and Everton were reportedly interested in the player before he joined Rubin.

Primarily left-sided, he is known for his pace — but also for some past disciplinary issues that delivered a spate of yellow cards during his time in La Liga.

And the Norwegian’s need for another wide player could increase if he receives unwelcome news about James Forrest.

The Scotland winger came off the bench in Saturday’s 6-1 rout of Dundee United but appeared to suffer a hamstring injury as he helped create the final goal. 

Deila admitted he expected Forrest to miss Wednesday night’s Champions League qualifier against Maribor but is hoping the damage may not be as bad as initially feared.

Celtic are also monitoring Adam Matthews after the Welsh full-back tweaked a calf muscle during the warm-up on Saturday and was replaced in the starting line-up by Efe Ambrose.

Regardless of those fitness concerns, newcomer Jason Denayer is confident an improving Parkhead side will not spurn the second chance they have been handed in Europe’s elite tournament.

The young Belgian centre-back, on loan from Manchester City, scored on his debut against United as Deila’s men warmed up in style for their scheduled first leg against the Slovenian champions.

Celtic were given a reprieve after Legia Warsaw were kicked out for fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in the second leg of a 6-1 aggregate win in the previous round. 

Unless the Court of Arbitration for Sport orders a dramatic u-turn on Legia’s punishment on Monday, Celtic will face Maribor in a £15m shoot-out for a place in the group stage.

And Denayer believes they are now in a far better position to make the most of their good fortune.

'We are now all feeling confident,’ said the 19-year-old. ‘We are going to play with a style of football which we hope will win the tie against Maribor.

‘We believe the defence will be more solid than against Legia. It’s not about me. I think you have to look at the last round as being at the start of the season. The coach was still new and some players are new. But now I think the team know each other better and it will be better in the games against Maribor.

‘There is a real sense among the players that we want to make the most of this. What has happened with the Legia tie is now in the past as far as we are concerned.

‘Now we are looking further, to try and win over two games against Maribor and get into the group stage.’
