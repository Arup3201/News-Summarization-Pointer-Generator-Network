The corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant that can be potentially fatal if ingested

A group of Girl Guides unwittingly planted poisonous wild flowers in a public park as part of a project backed by the BBC’s Countryfile programme.

Council groundsmen were called in to clear the rare toxic corncockles after being alerted by an amateur photographer.

Around 230,000 packets of mixed seeds were given away as part of the Grow Wild campaign to encourage members of the public to plant native wild flowers, meaning they could have sprung up in other public areas.

Although touching the plants carries a low risk of harm, ingesting the plant or its seeds can lead to severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, slow breathing and even death.

The Guides sowed the seeds in Jubilee Park in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, in May.

Mike McKee, who identified the corncockles, said: ‘I looked in my flower book and it said these were scant and very rare, so I did a bit more research on them. When I googled them I found out they could be deadly.’

The corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant. At one time, they were a common sight in fields, but modern agricultural methods have all but eliminated them from the wild – hence their inclusion in the ‘Grow Wild’ scheme.

Cultivated corncockle seeds are sold widely so it is not uncommon to see them in gardens.

Countryfile worked with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew to promote the seed packets during an episode of the programme earlier this year. Kew arranged the production and distribution of the seed packets, which were sent out to members of the public in March.

Professor Monique Simmonds, director of the Kew Innovation Unit, assured gardeners that the plants are not high risk.

She said: ‘This plant, like many we have in our gardens, does contain compounds that can be toxic if eaten in large amounts or eaten frequently over a period of time.

‘The toxic compounds are in higher concentrations in the seeds. If eaten by a child, they would most likely be sick or complain of a stomach ache. There is no evidence that eating a few seeds would cause acute toxicity.’

Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society, added: ‘Merely touching this plant is a very low risk indeed. We know of no instances of harm occurring from this plant in gardens.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Earlier this year Countryfile worked with Kew on their Grow Wild campaign and the packs of seeds in the give-away were provided and distributed by Kew.’
