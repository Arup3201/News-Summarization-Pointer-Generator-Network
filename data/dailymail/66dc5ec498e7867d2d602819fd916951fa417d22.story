Divock Origi will have to wait until the summer to become a Liverpool player as Brendan Rodgers is prepared to back the strikers he already has at Anfield.

Liverpool had been exploring the prospect of striking a deal with Lille to end Origi's loan and bring him to Merseyside for the final four months of the season.

Origi became a Liverpool player last summer but was immediately loaned back to Lille as part of the £10m deal but the Reds were at one stage hopeful that an arrangement could be struck.

Rodgers, however, is soon to welcome back Daniel Sturridge from injury and has Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli to provide options meaning Origi will now stay in France.

The show of faith from Rodgers comes following their comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday, where Borini and Lambert both scored.

Lambert announced he has 'no intention' of leaving Anfield during January, despite interest from other clubs, such as Crystal Palace.
