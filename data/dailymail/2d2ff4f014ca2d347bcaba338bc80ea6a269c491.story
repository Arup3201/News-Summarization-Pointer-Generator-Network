Actress Rosie Perez and Republican media pundit Nicolle Wallace are joining ABC's daytime chat show, The View, the network confirmed on Thursday.

As first revealed by the MailOnline one month ago, Nicolle, 42, will join Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell on the panel for the program's new season, beginning September 15.

Goldberg is the only original panel member on the show, where creator Barbara Walters retired from an onscreen role this spring and longtime producer Bill Geddie left after learning a new offscreen boss was taking over.

Perez is an actress and choreographer who has appeared in the movies Do the Right Thing and Fearless.

Wallace,
 a political analyst for MSNBC, was communications chief for President 
George W. Bush's reelection campaign and was an adviser on John McCain's
 2008 campaign.

Fellow newcomer Nicolle served as the communications chief during George W Bush's presidency and his 2004 re-election campaign, while she is a regularly featured political commentator for a number of TV news programs.

Fans of The View may remember Wallace from three guest-hosting appearances on the show earlier this year.

According to reports, Wallace was one of the early frontrunners for the highly-coveted position following screen tests last month.

While Perez's name has come somewhat out of the blue, she also guest-hosted in February and is already a well-established household name.

It will be quite the juggling act for the actress, who has just signed on to star opposite Larry David in his Broadway production of Fish In The Dark, though Deadline reports that the producers are working to accommodate her schedule.

The show will not only be back with a new cast on September 15 but a new studio, set, logo and crew, led by new executive producer Bill Wollf, following a huge revamp.
