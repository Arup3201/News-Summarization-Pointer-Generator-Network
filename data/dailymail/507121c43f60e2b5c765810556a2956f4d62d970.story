Attempts to reintroduce dormice where they had become extinct have failed – because the creatures are too dozy.

The species, once widespread in Britain, declined in the 1950s due to loss of hedgerows and  by the 1990s had become extinct in seven counties.

In an attempt to restore numbers, more than 700 dormice were released at 19 woodland sites from North Yorkshire to Suffolk by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES).

Doormice began to become extinct in the 1950s because of a loss in hedgerows

But a review of the 21-year-old, £13,000-a-year project for government wildlife advisers Natural England found it was ‘not an unqualified success’.

Ian White, an ecologist for the PTES, said that at five of the sites dormice are probably extinct, at four the species may be extinct and at ten it is too soon to say.

There were only two sites where the dormice had moved out of the woodland and nested  in the neighbouring countryside – a key sign of success.

One problem is the common or hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) likes to snooze.

Even when they become active at night they do not venture too far from home. Mr White said:  ‘I wouldn’t call them lazy exactly, it’s their lifestyle. They don’t go in for too much activity.’

Other factors blamed were mild winters and predators. Mr White said: ‘Between 50 to 70 per cent of dormice die in hibernation.

They are happy in snow but in mild weather they wake up and use up energy from their stores of fat. Dormice are also eaten by squirrels and will be taken by cats and owls.’

The species was once widespread in the UK. Now, an attempt to re-introduce the animals has been introduced in 19 counties
