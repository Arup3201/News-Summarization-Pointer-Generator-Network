A female British holidaymaker has cheated death after falling 30ft from a hotel balcony in Thailand.

Friends claim Romany Mitchell had her drinks spiked in a local bar before the accident on the island of Phuket.

Romany, 21, had returned to her five-star hotel alone, disorientated and crying and fell from the second floor at 3am.

She escaped with a badly injured ankle and is now undergoing physiotherapy in a local hospital.

'Very lucky': British tourist Romany Mitchell escaped with just a broken ankle after falling 30ft from a hotel balcony in Thailand on her gap year after graduating from Edinburgh Napier University

'Could have been much worse': Romany is carried away on a stretcher to hospital after her fall

A member of staff at the hotel said: 'It was her first night at the hotel and she had been out with friends, but she came back in a taxi alone. She was upset and crying.

'She was helped her to her room and about 30 or 40 minutes later there was a lot of noise outside, with lots of people gathered round her.

'It looks like she had fallen from the balcony. Many people were trying to help her.

'Her foot was injured and she had other injuries but she was very lucky, it could have been very much worse.'

The accident last Tuesday came as Romany took a gap year after graduating from Edinburgh Napier University.

She was rushed to a local hospital in Patong, but was later transferred to the larger Bangkok Phuket Hospital in Phuket.

Doctors there reportedly hailed her as 'the miracle' for surviving the plunge from her second-floor room.

A female travel companion was with her and it is understood she will be flown home later this week and transferred to hospital there.

Latest in a series of accidents: There are now calls for warnings to be put up at the airport for tourists arriving to be made aware of the high incidence of balcony falls

Foreign Office officials yesterday renewed warnings to Brits travelling to Thailand after this latest in a series of balcony falls.

In January, Lee Charie, 32, flew back to Britain with a section of his skull in his hand luggage after surviving a 22ft fall on his head.

He smashed the left side of his skull when he fell from the balcony on the island of Koh Tao in December last year.

The extra from The Only Way is Essex spent weeks in hospital before flying back to the UK for reconstructive surgery.

It is still unknown whether he slipped off the hotel balcony or was pushed.

There are now calls for warnings to be put up at the airport for tourists arriving to be made aware of the high incidence of balcony falls.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Our message to everyone is to behave responsibly when they are staying somewhere that has a balcony.

'Most incidents involve young people between the ages of 18 and 35 and whilst not always the case, alcohol often plays a part.'

Lee Charie, 32, from Stanstead Abbotts in Hertfordshire, recovers in hospital after having a quarter of his skull removed which he transported back to the UK in a box
