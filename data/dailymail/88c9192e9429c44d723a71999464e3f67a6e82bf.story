Russia has hit out at President Barack Obama's State of the Union address saying it showed the United States is seeking world domination.

During the speech last night, Mr Obama said the U.S. was upholding 'the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small' by opposing what he called Russian president Vladimir Putin's aggression and supporting democracy in Ukraine.

But now the Russians have claimed the speech showed how the United States believes it is 'number one' and is unable to be an equal.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said America had 'taken a course of confrontation' following President Obama's State of the Union address

Today Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a new conference that America had taken 'a course of confrontation'.

He said: 'Yesterday's speech by the president shows that at the centre of the U.S. philosophy is only one thing: "We are number one and everybody else has to respect that."

'It shows that the United States wants all the same to dominate the world and cannot merely be a first among equals.

'I would prefer all countries to adopt the philosophy of co-operation, not diktat.'

During yesterday's address President Obama specifically referred to Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.

He said: 'We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small - by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies.

During his speech yesterday, Obama, left, called out Russian president Vladimir Putin, right, and his aggression 

'Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.

'Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.'

President Obama's warning came after he and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to keep sanctions on Russia until it stops its aggression in Ukraine.

On Friday after talks in Washington Mr Obama said: 'We agree on the need to maintain strong sanctions against Russia until it ends its aggression in Ukraine, and on the need to support Ukraine as it implements important economic and democratic reforms.'

Relations between Russia and the United States have sunk to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War, mainly because of Moscow's confrontation with the West over the crisis in Ukraine.
