Colin Firth bought a whole new audience to the work of Jane Austen when he emerged from a lake with a wet shirt in the BBC adaptation of her classic novel Pride and Prejudice.Â 

Now the scene that set viewers' heart racing has been commemorated in a hugely unusual way - with a giant version of the character Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in London's Hyde Park.

The fibre-glass made sculpture 
caused a stir amongst passers-by as well as wildlife as it rose up from the Serpentine over the sunny weekend.

The inspiration: Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation

The model took a team of three 
sculptors more than two months to design, construct and paint and measures 12 feet - the equivalent to 
the height of a double decker bus.

The version of the romantic hero is largely based on Firth's portrayal but lead lead sculptor Toby Crowther said they also got inspiration from the book and the other actors who have played Mr Darcy over the years.

Various sources: Toby said they were inspired by the book and other portrayals of Mr Darcy to create the statue

He said: 'We took Colin Firth's famous lake scene 
as a starting point for creating Mr Darcy but we also read the book and 
looked at performances of the brooding hero by Matthew Macfadyen, David 
Rintoul and even Laurence Olivier.

'The challenge for us was capturing 
the spirit of Darcy as handsome and noble but also aloof and proud. The
Mr Darcy sculpture is a real mix of the many portrayals of Jane 
Austen's most famous hero.'

The installation was commissioned to celebrate the launch of UKTV's new TV channel Drama and Mr Darcy was chosen because Colin' Firth's lake exit from the BBC's 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice was named the most memorable British TV drama moment of all time in a recent survey.

Adrian Wills, general manager of UKTV 
channel Drama said: 'The giant Mr Darcy in The Serpentine is a fitting 
tribute to one of the most memorable moments in British TV drama. Jane 
Austen spent a lot of time walking in Hyde Park and along the banks of 
the Serpentine so we would like to think she would have approved of our 
new dashing Darcy.'

Those outside London don't have to miss out on the homage. Mr Darcy will embark on a short regional tour to venues including Scarborough beach, before it is installed at Lyme Park in Cheshire, where the scene was first filmed. It will remain in place in the lake at Lyme Park until February 2014.

Since 1995, Colin Firth has become a spy and the King of England, played gay and straight men and portrayed a family man as well as a bachelor. He's won countless awards, including an Oscar for the King's Speech, yet for many, he will always be Mr Darcy.

'I dare say if I did spend my waking hours reading my own fan mail I probably would feel Darcy was following me around,' he once told the Daily Mail. 'But I've got family and friends and children and none of them call me Mr Darcy.'

The actor admitted he had never read Jane Austen's novel before taking the role and nearly turned it down because at 35, he couldn't believe he was romantic lead material.

And while the part made him a household name, he admitted it wasn't always easy being constantly associated with a literary hero.

He said: 'In the years between Pride and Prejudice and Bridget Jones, I don't think there was a single interview in any newspaper that didn't have Darcy in the headline.'

But while for a time he may have resented the fact he could never escape the role, by taking part in the film adaptations of Bridget Jones's Diary the now 52-year-old has proved he can have a sense of humour about it.

Author Helen Fielding was inspired by Jane Austen with her bestselling books on hapless Bridget. The character had a crush on Colin Firth in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice and her own love interest was called Mark Darcy.

In a stroke of casting genius, Colin Firth takes on the role of Mark Darcy in the films (a third is currently being produced) and one scene where he fights with Hugh Grant's character in a fountain pokes fun at his infamous lake scene.

Neither Firth or the director of the BBC production, Simon Langton, had any idea how iconic the scene would become, still beloved by audiences 18 years later.

Mr Langton told the Daily Mail: 'Nobody had the slightest inkling that Colin Firth, wearing a lightweight cotton voile shirt with his nipples showing underneath, would have such an effect.'
