A gang who posed as detectives and used fake search warrants to raid pensioners' homes, confiscating their life savings, have been jailed for more than 15 years.

The burglars, led by Paul Momat, dressed and acted like police officers so they could gain entry to elderly people's houses, even kidnapping one victim to try to get more cash from her parents.

One of the four crooks' vulnerable victims was an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke, with the criminals walking away with her £25,000 savings.

Momat was jailed for six years, Carey for five years, Hudson (left) for four years. Lancaster (right) will be sentenced later this week after all four pleaded guilty

Brazen criminals Carl Hudson, Gareth Carey and Simon Lancaster arrived at pensioners' homes wearing suits and holding forged search warrants, saying they were there to confiscate cash.

The gang targeted specific individuals around Tyneside in a sophisticated plot which saw the three henchmen pretend to be detectives while Momat told them what to do over the phone, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

The men, who had somehow gained access to confidential personal records, fooled the 68-year-old stroke victim, from Gateshead, by telling her they knew her son was a serving police officer.

Speaking of the burglary on July 12, 2012, prosecutor James Adkin said:  'They fooled her into thinking they were the police and they had specialist knowledge about her family.

'They made references to her son being a police officer, which he is. One had a clipboard and knew the names of both of her sons.

'They said they were CID and showed her what they said was a search warrant. They worried her by making reference to a fine or prison if they found money.' 

Two weeks later, they went to a home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and tried to pull the same trick.

The man of the house asked to see their ID and one of them tipped a folder to show a search warrant. The householder was suspicious and the gang left.

In August that year they arrived at the home of a retired jeweller with a search warrant. After realising the home had CCTV, one of the gang called Momat, who ordered them to seize the camera's hard drive and leave empty-handed. 

In January last year, the crooks kidnapped a woman from Gateshead in an attempt to steal more money from her elderly parents, of whom one had suffered a stroke.

The gang, all from South Shields, took £25,000 from an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke in one of their burglaries in Tyneside, Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard

Carey put on a fake Scottish accent and told the woman and her husband that he had a search warrant.

After the gang seized £4,500, the vulnerable woman was told to go with the 'officers' to her parents' home, which the gang knew was nearby.

However, the bumbling crooks' Volvo ran out of fuel on the way, forcing them to walk the rest of the journey.

The elderly couple, aged 78 and 75, were startled by the visitors and shocked when they said they had a search warrant. No further money was taken. 

Momat, Hudson, Carey and Lancaster all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burglary. Hudson, Carey and Lancaster also admitted kidnap.

All four men also pleaded guilty conspiracy to steal by tricking a workman into handing over thousands by pretending they were detectives.

They told the victim, from Scotland, that they had catalytic convertors for sale and he arrived in South Shields to meet them.

One of them had a belt with handcuffs on and they seized the man's van, £7,500 cash and his phone, telling him he would be locked up if he didn't comply. 

Sentencing the four men from South Shields at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Brian Forster QC said: 'Any right-thinking member of the community who reads about this case will be shocked by the blatant disregard of the feelings of others.

'The case involved a system where entry was obtained by a pretence of being police officers.

'The victims have been left shocked and in some cases, have lost all of their savings.

'People who prey on the elderly commit serious offences. The court has a clear duty to deter offending in which people prey on vulnerable people and furthermore when they impersonate police officers.' 

Momat, 27, who has since been convicted of conspiring to rob a businessman at gunpoint and is serving an eight-year sentence, has been jailed for an extra six years.

He is also serving a further four-month sentence for using a mobile phone behind bars.

Hudson, 26 was sentenced to four years in prison and Carey, 26, was jailed for five years. Lancaster, 23, will be sentenced next week.
