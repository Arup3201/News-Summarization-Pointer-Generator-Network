Edinburgh have signed Nasi Manu from Super XV outfit Highlanders.

The 26-year-old - who has won world titles at under-19 and under-20 level with his country - has penned a two-year deal with Alan Solomons' squad and will make the switch once his current side's season ends this summer.

Manu made his Super XV debut in 2008 for Crusaders - before he had even played a senior club game - but moved to the Highlanders in 2010.

Manu said: 'I'm excited to be heading to Edinburgh and taking up a new challenge in my career. 

'My partner and I are looking forward to living in Scotland and learning more about the history and culture.'
