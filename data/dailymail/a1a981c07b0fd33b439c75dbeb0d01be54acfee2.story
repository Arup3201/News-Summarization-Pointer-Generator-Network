Heather Mills has abandoned her attempt to qualify for the British  Paralympic skiing team following a row over her boot.

Sir Paul McCartney’s former wife – who had her left leg amputated below the knee in 1993 after a road accident – was told she must wear a cover over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules.

The 45-year-old had argued that it would result in ‘unnecessary weight’ and cause ‘intolerable pain’.

She had hoped to compete at the games in Sochi, Russia, in March after winning a World Cup silver medal earlier this year.

But
 Sylvana Mestre, of the International Paralympic Committee, said the 
former model would be disqualified if she did not comply with the 
ruling.

Miss Mills’ spokesman said: ‘We cannot believe she was told she 
would be disqualified for not wearing cosmetic, non-functional buckles 
on her ski boot.

‘We feel 
very saddened that all her hard work, injury, struggles and the 
overcoming of them, has come to her having to resign because of a 
bureaucratic decision that would lead to further pain and injury.

‘Although
 her dreams and hopes for Sochi are now over, Heather hopes to one day 
compete in winter sports when the IPC re-evaluates the unfair systems it
 has in place.’

Despite 
Mills’ World Cup skiing success, she struggled through her 
qualification for the Paralympics – with problems including being 
‘ejected’ from her prosthetic leg when practising slalom.

In the 
summer, she had a new leg and boot design created by London Prosthetics 
Centre to help reduce the problem.

Mills’
 management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left 
leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful 
inflammation and blisters.

Craig
 Spence, spokesman for the IPC, said: ‘On July 1, we sent a memo to all 
countries asking them to submit their adaptive equipment for each skier 
for the forthcoming year.

‘We
 cleared the prosthetic leg Heather was using then, but when we saw the 
new boot this week, we realised it was different and that she should not
 have been racing on it.

‘It’s a real shame because she has made such great progress this year.’
