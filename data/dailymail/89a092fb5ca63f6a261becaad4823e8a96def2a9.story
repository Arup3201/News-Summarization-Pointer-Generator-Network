Emily Maitlis’s outfit on Newsnight on Wednesday – complete with spotty tie, waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves - sparked discussion among viewers

It is meant to be BBC television’s flagship current affairs programme.

But, for some, Newsnight appeared to be more reminiscent of school-set comedy St Trinian’s.

Emily Maitlis’s outfit on Wednesday night – complete with spotty tie, waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves – raised more than a few eyebrows on social networking site Twitter.

The BBC2 programme was watched by 830,000 people but it was the 44-year-old’s unusual outfit choice that sparked discussion and drew attention away from what was meant to be the programme’s top story. 

The leading segment was intended as a serious discussion about the announcement by the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson’s contract would not be renewed following a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon.

Miss Maitlis interviewed Alan Yentob, the BBC’s creative director and presenter of arts show Imagine, about the decision. Mr Yentob’s remarks on the programme were also criticised as elitist.

One viewer tweeted: ‘Why is Emily Maitlis dressed as if she has escaped from the sets of St Trinian’s, refusing to play the extra.’ 

Another added: ‘Of course we all adore Emily Maitlis almost as much as she adores herself but isn’t the ravaged St Trinian’s schoolgirl look a tad de trop?’

A third wrote: ‘Emily Maitlis is wearing a strange outfit this eve, part off duty city boy, part pirate.’

This is not the first time the journalist’s wardrobe has drawn comments. In 2012, she was compared to a Sontaran – an alien from Doctor Who – after anchoring BBC News while wearing an unconventional collar. 

She was also once criticised for her numerous costume changes while presenting a documentary about the social networking site Facebook.
