Accused: Kildup Singh, QC, was clocked going through a red light at speed 1.4 seconds after it had changed to stop

A High Court judge accused of jumping a red light at more than double the speed limit is battling to have his case thrown out claiming it is 'oppressive'.

Kuldip Singh QC, 58, was clocked racing through a central London junction at 64mph in his 3.2 litre C-Class Mercedes Benz a full 1.4 seconds after the light had turned red.

However, the Deputy High Court Judge, who also sits on the FA disciplinary panel, said prosecutors have been 'misleading and manipulative' in the legal action against him.

The case has already been listed seven times and had four hearings - but Singh is yet to enter a plea for the offence which happened in November last year.

At one stage he claimed the device used to catch him was not Home Office approved but later dropped this argument.

Singh even complained about his right to a fair trial and cited Article 6 of the Human Rights Act during his latest appearance.

Andrew Perry, prosecuting at Westminster Magistrates Court, said: 'This case has dragged on because the defendant didn’t put his hands up at the outset and has sought to claim there was something wrong with the criteria being operated by City of London Police - there is not.'

Singh argues the case should be dropped because he was not given the option of paying an on-the-spot fine and official guidelines show speed should not have been taken into account when the decision was taken to prosecute.

Representing himself he said: 'These proceedings should never have been brought on the basis that they were - I should not be before the court.'

He allegedly committed the offence driving his black Mercedes along a 30mph stretch of Farringdon Street at its junction with Stonecutter Street in the City of London.

He is not charged with speeding.

Mr Perry, an expert in the field who advises both the CPS and ACPO, told the judge the case had been reviewed at the highest levels, said: 'Due to the time the signal was red the defendant would have been prosecuted, he would not have received a fixed penalty notice anywhere in the country.'

He added that Singh's speed was 'clearly a relevant consideration'.

Mr Perry said: 'It is a serious case of crossing a red traffic light.'

District Judge Quentin Purdy was been handed three lever arch folders stuffed with documents by the Singh as part of his defence.

Singh, who qualified as a barrister in 1975 and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1993, said: 'These proceedings have become oppressive and ought to be stopped.'

Protracted: Kuldip Singh, QC, arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court with his legal adviser. The case has alraedy been listed seven times and had four hearings but he is yet to enter a plea

He also complained that getting documents from the prosecution had been like 'pulling teeth'.

However, Mr Perry said: 'The defendant has built his abuse argument on sand, an incorrect statement of law, and then has tried to discredit the prosecution as they deal with his shifting assertions.'

Singh, whose address was given in court as his chambers, Serle Court, at New Square, Camden, north London, has not formally entered a plea to a single count of contravening a red traffic light.

District Judge Purdy, who noted a 'huge amount of court time' had already been taken up by the case, will give his ruling on January 29.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
