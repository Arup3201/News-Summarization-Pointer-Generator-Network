A Spanish town played host to some very saucy behaviour as tens of thousands of people gathered to pelt one another with 120 tons of tomatoes at the annual Tomatina festival.

Around 40,000 men and woman armed themselves with copious amounts of edible ammunition to take part in La Tomatina - described as the world's biggest food fight - in Bunol, Valencia, on Wednesday, with many donning swimming goggles to protect their eyes from flying tomato juice.

The streets of Bunol were soon awash with the pulp of thousands upon thousands of squashed tomatoes as the festival - believed to date back to 1945 - got underway.

The tomatoes were transported to Bunol's main square in a convoy of five trucks, which struggled to find a path through the seething crowds of festival-goers eager to start flinging fruit.

'I can't throw fast enough. This is crazy,' said one festival-goer named Angel, who was taking part in La Tomatina for a third time.

Another Tomatina veteran, called Nestor, chose to watch this year's proceedings from the safety of a balcony, choosing to spray festival-goers with a water hose rather than brave the flying tomatoes on the streets below.

'It's a battle of crazy people, who get on together, and no injuries,' he said.

Tomatoes must be squashed before being flung to prevent festival-goers getting hit by the flying fruit being hurt.

Media coverage of the quirky festival has seen it grow in popularity over the years, with tourists travelling from all over the world to take part in the event.

People from as far afield as Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India were among those dodging flying tomatoes in Bunol on Wednesday.

The food fight is expected to boost the economy of the town in recession-hit Spain by 300,000 euros, according to spokesman Rafael Perez.

'We don't have much space but there is no other way. It [La Tomatina] has been here since 1945.' he said.

La Tomatina traditionally takes place on the last Wednesday in August in Bunol, which is around 25 miles north of the coastal city of Valencia - Spain's third largest city.

Though the origins of La Tomatina are unclear, it is thought to have its roots in a food fight between childhood friends in the mid 1940s, an AFP report said.

After the annual food fight in Bunol, many of the tomato-soaked festival-goers head to the river in the town to wash off the pulp.

Six special trains were laid on for this year's Tomatina, providing an extra 29,000 seats for people heading to the festival, and camping grounds were also set up to cater for the influx of tourists.
