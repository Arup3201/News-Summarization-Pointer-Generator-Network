An 11-year-old boy who was kicked out of the classroom for having a VW logo shaved into the back of his head was taken out of school for a week by his mother who branded the decision 'ridiculous'.

Zac Eccleston was chucked out of classes and put into isolation at Camborne Science and International Academy in Cornwall after he turned up with the new haircut.

The year 7 pupil had been treated to the £15 haircut by his step-grandfather over the Christmas holidays and opted for that particular design because of his love of the Volkswagen brand.

Zac Eccleston, 11, from Camborne, Cornwall, was taken out of school for a week by his angry mother who said it was 'ridiculous' he was put into isolation for his £15 VW haircut

However, when he went back to school after the festive break, he was immediately banished to isolation and forced to work on his own for not complying with school uniform rules.

His mother, Charlotte, immediately collected her son and kept him off school for a week until she met with staff at the school to resolve the situation.

The 28-year-old hairdresser, of Camborne, Cornwall, said: 'It's ridiculous. It's clear there's a school uniform policy but a haircut isn't a uniform.

'By 8.45am last Monday they had rang and told me he was going to be put in isolation. I said "no you're not" and went and picked him up.

'The minute we got home he burst into tears. He was chuffed with his hair over Christmas and then all this happened when he went back and it knocked him down. He was gutted.

'He was hurt to think he'd been put into isolation and for something so trivial. It is not right that he had to sit in a room by himself because of a haircut.  I kept him off because I'm not having my son treated as a prisoner.'

Zac's stepdad, Jamie Betteley, said the decision to put the youngster in isolation over a haircut was 'pathetic'.

The 31-year-old said: 'It's not fair to put him in a room on his own. A haircut doesn't affect his learning. It's just pathetic. 

'He had stars shaved into the back of his head when he was around nine or 10 and no one at his primary school said anything then so we didn't think it would be a problem this time around.'

Mr Betteley also said the ordeal wouldn't stop his stepson having another unique hairstyle in future.

He said: 'He'll probably have another one again... it will just be in the six week summer holiday next time.'

Camborne Science and International Academy in west Cornwall said the 'extreme' haircut was completely against the school's uniform policy

Zac, 11, right, had all of last week off school after his mother Charlotte, right, said he could stay off until he was allowed back into normal classrooms instead of being banished to isolation

However, Mark Fenlon, vice-principle at Camborne Science and International Academy in west Cornwall, said the school uniform policy was clear to both pupils and parents.

He said: 'Parents and students are aware of the high standards and there are no 
exceptions. The decision to remove Zac from school was not ours.'

The vice-principle also upheld that hairstyles were 'very much a part of the school uniform policy'.

He said: 'Hairstyles are absolutely part of school uniform and we don't accept extreme haircuts. 

'Camborne Science and International Academy is the top performing state school in Cornwall and we believe our school uniform policy is one of the factors that makes us such a good school and one of choice for our parents.'

Zac returned to school on Monday after having last week off and was allowed to resume learning in the classroom with other pupils after his mum met with teachers.

Ms Eccleston, who said she hadn't shaved her son's hair to get rid of the hairstyle because it would've 'stood out' even more, said it was in the process of growing out and said she was glad he had been allowed to return to normal classes instead of isolation.

Mr Fenlon said: 'I've met with his mum and she has complied with the rules and the hairstyle has grown out.'
