The inhabitants of Easter Island lived off local rats, according to scientists who analysed the teeth of 41 skeletons.

The island, also called Rapa Nui, first settled around A.D. 1200, is famous for its more than 1,000 'walking' Moai statues, most of which originally faced inland.

Researchers compared the teeth that had been excavated previously to animal bones unearthed on the island.

By looking at the nitrogen and carbon isotopes of each, they round that Polynesian rats, also known as kiore, was one of the main sources of protein in the first few centuries of the island's history.

The rat is somewhat smaller than European rats and, according to ethnographic accounts, tasty to eat.

Located in the South Pacific, Rapa Nui is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth and the closest inhabitants are located on the Pitcairn Islands about 1,200 miles to the west.

The researchers were also able to radiocarbon date 26 of the teeth remains, allowing them to plot how the diet on the island changed over time.

Radiocarbon dating works by measuring the decay of carbon-14, allowing a date range to be assigned to each individual.

Report co-author John Dudgeon, from Idaho State University, told LiveScience that rats should not be underestimated in their value as a food resource.

Researchers said catching a rat to eat may have been easier - and tastier - than catching a fish

He said for the people who lived on Rapa Nui, 'it was probably easier to go get a rat than it was to go get a fish.'

The Polynesian rat commonly travels with humans on ocean voyages and, like any other rat, multiplies rapidly when it arrives on a new island.

In some cases, the rats were probably transported intentionally to be used as food, something supported by ethnographic accounts stating that, in some areas of Polynesia, rats were being consumed at the time of European contact.

Additionally, previous research has suggested the rats were at least partly responsible for the deforestation of Rapa Nui.

The research, which was published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, also found that islanders rarely ate seafood but added to their diet with chickens and C3 plants, such as sweet potatoes, bananas and yams.

Amy Commendador, of the Idaho Museum of Natural History at Idaho State University, told LiveScience: 'Traditionally, from Polynesian cultures you have a heavy predominance of using marine products, especially in the early phase of colonization.'

She said one reason people did not eat seafood is that the north of the island contains steep cliffs and would have been difficult to fish from.

Its southerly latitude may make it cooler and affect fishing, she said.

'Because of their geographic location and climate conditions, there just weren't as many marine products for them to get,' Commendador said.

Some of the skeletons studied by the researchers appeared to eat more fish than others.

The reports suggests that fish eaters may have lived on a part of the island where fishing was easier or that eating fish was a mark of having a 'higher status'.
