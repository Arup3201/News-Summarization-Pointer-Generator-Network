With more than 70 bombs raining on his neighbourhood, on the outskirts of Damascus, every day, decorator Jamal Mittar knew it was only a matter of time before one would strike his home.

When that day came, he just hoped neither he nor his wife, son or daughter would be in, unlike so many of his Syrian friends and neighbours slain in their beds or at their kitchen tables.

Luckily, nobody was in when the rocket fell. But with no home, no work and little food to go round, Jamal made the impossible decision to take his family far away, fleeing the routine horrors of Syria's bloodthirsty civil war.

Bare necessities: A group of Syrian children are collecting water from a tap stand in Zaatari camp

'Every day they choose a certain area to drop a rocket to kill everyone,' he says. 'My house has completely vanished.

'We were living in the ruins but then it was destroyed by a bomb. At first there were rockets near the building so it was half destroyed. There was continuous bombing. Everyone is getting slain.'

Jamal's is one of countless stories of fear and desperation that has propelled terrified Syrians into refugee camps across the border, further deepening the humanitarian crisis, which aid agency Oxfam says is at its worst point since the conflict erupted two years ago.

'The world risks failing the people of Syria at a time when they most need our help. Responding to this crisis is now our number one priority,' said Oxfam’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, who is currently visiting refugees on the Syria/Jordan border.

Humanitarian crisis: Syrian refugees arrive at a cramped Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, their belongings strews around them

Help: Jamal Mattar's father, who is in his eighties is receiving medical treatment after he suffered a heart attack just after crossing the border into Jordan

Swelling numbers: Some of the 1.3million Syrians living in refugee camps gather to collect water that has just been delivered by truck

He added: 'We hear each day that the situation in Syria is desperate for so many but providing an appropriate humanitarian response is extremely difficult – and deeply frustrating. Restrictions on access mean far too many vulnerable people are not getting the help they have a right to.'

Jamal's wife and daughter are two of these people. They never returned after the bomb dropped because they had been held at a new military checkpoint a mile away.

Jamal waited for them in the ruins of his home with his son and elderly parents before he was forced to leave without them for the safety of what family he had left.

He drove along the back roads to get as close to the border as possible before walking an hour and a half to cross into Jordan.

His father, in his eighties, had a heart attack after crossing and was on his way to hospital for treatment. They finally arrived at Zaatari Camp where he waits patiently, in the desperate hope that his wife will one day find him so the family can be reunited.

There are currently 1.3million Syrians living in abject conditions in the many refugee camps across the border.

Struggle: A reception tent in Zaatari where they get one meal, blankets and spend their first night, but with increased numbers of arrivals mean facilities are stretched to the limit

Make do and mend: A fence dividing one part of Zaatari refugee camp from another is used as a washing line

And with nearly seven million people in need of humanitarian help inside Syria, Oxfam is calling on the UN Security Council to help improve access by using its influence to urge the Syrian Government and opposition groups to help ensure aid reaches those most in need.

This could mean allowing aid to cross lines of control and cross-border from neighbouring countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  

In a new briefing paper released today, called 'Overtaken By Need', Oxfam says that three months after $1.5bn was pledged for the UN’s six-month appeal, only a little over half of the money has been received, much of it from Gulf countries.

Meanwhile, refugee numbers have doubled in the first three months of the year and Oxfam warns that similar or even higher levels of funding will be required for the response in the future as the humanitarian catastrophe worsens.

'The aid effort on the borders has been slow to get off the ground and now needs to be scaled up significantly,' added Goldring.

Crucial aid: Cement is laid for bathroom blocks in Zaatari camp to provide toilets, showers and laundry areas for 20,610 people in part of the camp but, it is not enough

Helping hands: Oxfam is installing 334 permanent toilets, 288 showers, 72 laundry areas and 72 ablution areas - all housed within 48 hygiene blocks

'A massive increase in humanitarian assistance is required but we fear that instead of being stepped up, the reverse is more likely to happen and aid levels could soon decline.'

In Jordan’s Za’atari refugee camp, increased numbers of arrivals mean facilities are stretched to the limit. Oxfam has installed toilets, showers and laundry areas to help 20,610 people in part of the camp but the organisation hopes to do more.

There are concerns that failure to respond fully to the humanitarian emergency could have serious consequences on stability across the wider region.

Countries that have provided help for Syrian refugees, such as Jordan and Lebanon, are already feeling the economic and social strains of hosting such large numbers and need much greater international assistance, the aid agency said.

There have already been riots over poor living conditions and shortages of aid given in refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey.

'When refugees arrive in Jordan and Lebanon they are traumatized and fearful for the future. As the needs of Syrians and refugees increase, so must the response', said Goldring.

'The future will be very bleak for people affected by this crisis unless they get more support.'
