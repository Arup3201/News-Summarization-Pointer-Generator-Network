A historic hotel in a building dating back to the 1800s is up for sale after standing empty for three years - for the knockdown price of just £250,000. 

The Seafield Arms Hotel in Cullen, Moray, was originally put on the market for £900,000 when it went on the market in 2011.

But after being reduced to £490,000 by Shepherd Chartered Surveyors last May, its guide price has been slashed once again to attract a buyer as it goes up for auction in London next week.

Unattractive offer: The Seafield Arms Hotel has stood empty for the past three years

Prominent position: The 23-bedroom hotel attracted thousands of guests in its heyday

During its heyday the hotel attracted thousands of visitors to the Moray coast but after shutting up shop in 2011 it has failed to attract a buyer. 

Simon Bailey, a director and auctioneer at Eddisons, the firm holding the sale, said: ‘This is a well-known property in a prominent position which could be re-established as a fully trading hotel. 

‘It also has potential for alternative uses, subject to planning.’

Originally built as a coaching house by the Earl of Seafield in 1822, the three-storey building was restored in 1972.

For sale: The venue is being auction for £250k - three years after it was valued at £1m

'Eyesore': The hotel is going under the hammer to attract a buyer after standing empty for three years

But after its closure local residents branded it an eyesore. 

Ron Shepherd from Moray Council said: ‘The Seafield Arms was a really nice and classy place, so I'm hoping that it remains a hotel. 

‘But the main thing is that something is done with it - even if it's turned into flats. 

‘At the moment it looks awful. It's in a really prominent position in the town and it's terrible to see it all boarded up. Surely at £250,000 it must finally sell. 

‘It will need money spending on it inside, but at that price it's going to be an absolute steal for somebody.’
