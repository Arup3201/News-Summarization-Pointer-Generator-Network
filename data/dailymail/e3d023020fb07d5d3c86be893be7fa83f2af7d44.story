It is a chance to own a piece of British motoring history - an incredibly rare pre-production Range Rover, which was developed in secret under the code name Velar. 

Land Rover, in an effort to disguise the new Range Rover brand, designed the brand new luxury 4x4, and issued it with a name Velar, which in Italian, means covered.

In an effort to further disguise the heritage of the car, the first 30 development models were issued with number plates from Croydon - instead of Solihull, to further confuse any potential industrial spies.

One of the prototype Range Rovers developed by Land Rover in the late 1960s is going under the hammer early next year in Dorset 

The Range Rover Velar, is still on its original number plates which add to the important historical value of the incredibly rare vehicle 

The vehicle's chassis plate shows the important number which proves the car to be one of the first pre-production development vehicles 

Early next year, the incredibly rare prototype Range Rover is expected to sell for more than £30,000 at auction.

Land Rover wanted to develop a luxury off-roader that was capable of coping with the demands of the countryside while providing the level of comfort normally associated with a high-end saloon. 

Designers worked on the project in secret under the name Velar, from the Italian 'velare', meaning 'veiled' or 'covered'. 

Before the introduction of the Range Rover, off-road vehicles were seen as very agricultural and used by farmers or people in remote locations. 

Land Rover developed just 30 of these prototype vehicles and according to the car's chassis number, it is the 38th vehicle to have been completed. 

The development models were registered in 1969 on a H registration plate - more than a year before the car's official launch in September 1970. 

Despite its size, the Range Rover was faster than most production saloons in 1970 with its 3.5 litre V8 petrol engine. It had a 0-60 time of around 15 seconds while its top speed approached 100 miles per hour. The original car was sold at launch for £1,990. 

In addition, the car had a four-speed manual gear box with a low and high ratio - doubling the number of available gears and giving it unrivaled off-road performance while allowing it to cruise along the new motorways at high speed.

Range Rover claimed its new car 'provides excellent and comfortable transport to and from the office and because of its good lock and light steering and all-round visibility and roomy luggage space, it is an ideal vehicle, particularly for women drivers, for taking the children to school'

According to Land Rover's official press release from 1970, the new car 'provides excellent and comfortable transport to and from the office and because of its good lock, light steering, and all-round visibliity and roomy luggage space, it is an ideal vehicle, particularly for women drivers, for shopping and taking the children to school, as well as being perfectly suited to take the family and caravan and boat comfortably off the beaten track and away from the crowds.'

The car is being sold by Charterhouse Auctions in Sherborne Dorset early next year.  

It is being sold by a private owner from Bristol, and over the years has had its original V8 engine replaced with a Land Rover 300TDi engine and some body panels changed.

Richard Bromell, from the auction house, said: 'This is one of the earliest Range Rovers ever made.

'It’s the eighth vehicle made by Velar, a company set up Land Rover to develop the Range Rover, and is one of just 40 of the Velar Range Rovers made.

'The Range Rover was launched in 1970 and was a success form the start. Now in its fourth generation, early Range Rovers have a large and loyal following.

'Despite being such an important early vehicle, this Velar Range Rover has been well used over the past 44 years and has had the original V8 petrol engine replaced with a more economical, the interior changed and some of the body panels replaced.

'This is such an early and important Range Rover that we estimate it could fetch £30,000 for its Bristol owner.'
