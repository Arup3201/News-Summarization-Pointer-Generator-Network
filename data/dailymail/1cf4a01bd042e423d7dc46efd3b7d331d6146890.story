An online retailer which was caught selling vulgar Jimmy Savile T shirts has sparked fury by selling a selection of golliwog goods.

The items, including T shirts, duvet covers, pillow cases and cushions have been branded as ‘deeply offensive racist paraphernalia’ by campaigners who have urged the site to remove them.

The merchandise, which range in price from £1 stickers to the £58 duvet cover, were discovered for sale via on-line community and marketplace Redbubble.

T-shirts with golliwog prints in a selection of sizes and colours were being sold on the site for £14.93

The selection of golliwog goods, including bags, have been branded as ‘deeply offensive racist paraphernalia’ by campaigners who have urged the site to remove the items

Campaigners for racial equality said the golliwog was 'deeply offensive' and should be 'consigned to the dustbin of history' 

The site caused outrage when it was found last week selling T shirts with paedophile Jimmy Savile on them

Redbubble was also advertising vulgar Jimmy Savile T shirts on its site which glorified the paedophile 

Only last week, the site was caught selling T-shirts of paedophile Jimmy Savile with jokey slogans about child abuse.

Lee Jasper, a British race relations activist, told MailOnline: ‘It remains an offensive caricature of the African slaves entertaining other slaves on a plantation.

‘It should be consigned to the dustbin of history, as it is deeply offensive.

‘The golliwog character was created at the end of the most vicious period of the 500 years of slavery.

‘The African community are getting tired of seeing it used as a means to make a profit.

‘It is deeply disappointing that we are having this type of discussion in the 21st century.’

The golliwog, with thick lips, unruly black hair and paws is seen as an offensive caricature of black people

Redbubble said they were aware of the controversy around golliwog dolls, but said they only removed dolls which have 'implicit or explicit racist undertones or are used in an offensive manner' 

The golliwog character was created by Florence Upton in 1895 in her book entitled ‘The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwog’, where it was described as ‘a horrid sight, the blackest gnome’.

She clothed her golliwogs with thick lips, unruly black hair and paws instead of hands and feet.

After Upton created the golliwog, it became a favourite for collectors and was popular in the UK as the mascot of Robertson’s jam.

But by the 1980s, it was increasingly seen as an offensive racist caricature of black people. Robertson’s dropped their golliwog mascot, called Golly, from their labelling in 2001.

Chi Onwurah MP, who became Newcastle’s first black MP in 2010, said: ‘Golliwog was one of the most common and most hurtful of the racial insults I faced as a child.

‘I find it amazing that any reputable retailer would seek to make money by promoting this racist stereotype.

‘If they are selling Jimmy Savile T-shirts as well, they clearly see a market opportunity in offending both victims of racial and sexual abuse and they certainly do not deserve to profit from it.’

Adam Afriyie MP said: ‘I am delighted MailOnline are highlighting this issue, which causes concern to so many people.’

The duvet covers with golliwog prints retailed at £58 - campaigners said it was 'completely mistaken' for any company to sell products that 'only promote racist bigotry' 

The range of golliwog merchandise was described as 'deeply disappointing' by MPs and campaigners

Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said: ‘In a free market we have to reluctantly accept this horrible merchandise.

‘This imagery is deeply offensive to the majority of black people. We are in the 21st century and the vast majority of people are acutely aware of the historic and offensive nature of these golliwog dolls with the caricature of black people with bulging eyes and big lips.

Adam Afriyie MP said: ‘I am delighted MailOnline are highlighting this issue, which causes concern to so many people'

‘It is deeply offensive to us and our children.

‘Now Redbubble know about this, I would hope they would issue a quick apology and not sell items that deeply offend tens of thousands of people.’

Ian Pattison, from the Youth Against Racism in Europe group, said: ‘Golliwogs and other racist paraphernalia rightly went out of fashion long ago.

‘Today most people are completely opposed to racism, and reject any attempt to return to the divisive attitudes of the past. It is completely mistaken for any company to sell products that only promote racist bigotry.’ 

In recent years, there have been a number of scandals involving the golliwog character.

In February 2009, Carol Thatcher, daughter of Margaret Thatcher, was sacked from her slot on the BBC’s One Show after she made off-air comments comparing French tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to a golliwog.

Despite being confronted by presenter Adrian Chiles and other guests, Thatcher refused to apologise and was promptly axed.

In March 2011, two prospective Conservative local councillors, Bill and Star Etheridge, a married couple, resigned from the party after their membership was suspended following complaints from fellow party members that they had used images of golliwogs as part of a protest against political correctness. The pair then both defected to the UK Independence Party.

In August, Bill Etheridge hit the headlines again, when he described Hitler as a ‘magnetic and forceful public speaker’ who ‘achieved a great deal’ – and said UKIP candidates should copy the rhetorical style deployed by Hitler at the Nuremberg rallies.

In 2011 two Conservative councillors, married couple Bill and Star Etheridge posted pictures of them posing with golliwog dolls - they subsequently resigned and defected to UKIP

Martin Hosking, Redbubble CEO told MailOnline: ‘Redbubble takes all issues of racism very seriously and any material that promotes racism is removed in compliance with our guidelines. We are aware of the controversy around golliwog dolls that is a peculiarly British thing and understand that it is the subject of intense debate.

‘In balancing the conflicting sensibilities we remove any images of dolls which have implicit or explicit racist undertones or are used in any offensive manner. If you or your readers believe the images that remain are being used in a racist way or in contravention to our guidelines we are grateful for bringing them to our attention for further review.’ 

Rhana Griffin, Artist Outreach at Redbubble said: 'This subject has come up before, and we decided they were OK for Redbubble - just.'
