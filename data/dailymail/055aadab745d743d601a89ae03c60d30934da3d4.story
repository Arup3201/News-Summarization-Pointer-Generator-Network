A teenager who had to be rescued by firefighters after he became stuck in a child’s swing insisted it was just 'one of those things'.

Shaun Dibsdale, 17, climbed into the toddler swing in his local park in Frome, Somerset, to have a cigarette with friends, but had to call the emergency services when he realised he couldn't get out of it.

The college student was stuck for half an hour before firefighters rescued him by taking the play equipment apart with an Allen key, but the teenager insisted he wasn't embarrassed, saying: 'I was just like "whatever" really.'

Wedged: Student Shaun Dibsdale, 17, had to be helped out by firefighters after he got stuck in it for half an hour 

At first, the emergency workers tried to ease the teenager out of the swing, which is designed for toddlers

After some efforts from his friends, Lawrence Oakford, 23, and Chris Burge, 18, failed to budge him, they dialled 101 for help.

Firefighters arrived and tried but failed to pull Shaun out, so they had to take the swing apart.  Shaun was treated for thigh injuries by paramedics before being allowed home.

But his ordeal wasn't over, because his friends, who had filmed the whole episode, uploaded the video to social media sites, where it quickly attracted more than 20,000 views.

Shaun said: 'They found the whole thing hilarious and put it on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other places.

'They were just taking the mick constantly.'

He explained his decision to sit in the swing, saying: 'We were walking up towards the park on Sunday when I decided to sit down somewhere dry to roll a fag and have a smoke.

'I decided to jump in the swing, and got in really easily.  I just slipped straight in, so I thought I was OK.

His hood firmly up, Shaun waits for the emergency crews to free him from the swing in Frome, Somerset

The teenager said he had wriggled into the swing 'smoothly', so he wasn't anticipating problems getting out

'But when I went to get out I saw I couldn’t and I was really stuck.  We called 101 to get advice to see what we could do, and they called out and ambulance.'

He said: 'Afterwards my thighs and crotch were really hurting because there wasn’t much room for me at all.'

Shaun's friends posted footage of the episode online, where it was viewed by thousands of people
