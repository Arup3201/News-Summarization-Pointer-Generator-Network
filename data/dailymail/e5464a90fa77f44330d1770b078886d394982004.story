Police who found a body in woodlands after searching for a missing 19-year-old hairdresser have charged her boyfriend with murder.

Amelia Arnold disappeared from the home she shared with Jack Wall, 22, and their young daughter in Stevenage last Wednesday.

After a police appeal, unemployed Wall handed himself into the town’s police station on Sunday, where he was charged with murder.

Later yesterday, a body - believed to be 
Amelia’s - was recovered from undergrowth in woods of Travellers Lane, 
Hatfield, 10 miles away from her home.

Wall is due to appear at Hatfield Remand Court this morning.

Another man Joseph Potter, 41, from Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, was arrested on Saturday and charged with 
perverting the course of justice.

He was remanded in custody at Hatfield Remand Court yesterday.

Formal identification and a post mortem are to be carried out.

A spokesperson for Hertfordshire Police said: 'Amelia’s family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.'

Miss Arnold, 19, a hairdresser 
originally from Horam, East Sussex, moved to Hertfordshire at some point
between 2008 and 2010, and attended the Sir Frederic Osborn School in 
Welwyn Garden City.

She is believed to have been working 
as a hair stylist at The Works salon in Stevenage.

Disappearance: The missing girl, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has not been seen since Wednesday

A body, believed to be that of Amelia's, has been found ten miles away from her home in woodlands

DCI Redfearn had earlier appealed 
directly to Wall to present himself to police, saying: 'If you are 
reading this, please go to Stevenage or your nearest police station to 
speak with officers.'

Witnesses who may have seen suspicious
activity at the address between Wednesday and Friday are also being 
asked to come forward.

Mr Redfearn said: 'We’ve been speaking
with residents in Hadrian’s Walk but I would like to hear from anyone 
who has been in the area between these times and believes they may have 
seen or heard any suspicious activity to make contact with police.

'We would also like to appeal to 
anyone who may have witnessed anyone acting suspiciously in a white 
Citroen Berlingo, registration R389 VDP, in the Stevenage area since 
Wednesday.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
