Fixing jet skis, posting bail and storing lost property are some of the things Australian embassies cannot help with when travellers run into trouble overseas.

These may sound like strange demands but remarkably these are the kind of requests embassies have received from Australians every year, which also include borrowing a laptop and providing legal assistance.

And Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop thinks it is time for some tough love.

The Australian government is cracking down on people who do the wrong thing and request help from the embassies, which include posting their bail

The department has launched a campaign to alert travellers about what is reasonable - and more importantly, unreasonable - to expect from Australia's consular services abroad.

'Our consular staff are not there to pay for the repairs to your jet ski. They are not there to pay your hotel bill,' Ms Bishop said in Canberra.

'Consular assistance is a last resort service.'

Australia's diplomats have noticed some trends in recent years as the number of trips taken abroad has exploded to nearly ten million a year.

Last year diplomats helped nearly 15,000 Australians in trouble, and juggled more than 1,000 active cases a day

Less people are needing medical evacuation or emergency financial assistance these days but more are dying, getting arrested or winding up in hospital.

Bangkok remains the busiest consular post in the world, unsurprising as Thailand's the top destination for Australians dying or getting hospitalised.

But hundreds of the cases at that embassy were classed as 'general welfare', and the growing number of travellers seeking help for trivial matters is putting strain on the system.

But Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop stressed that those in genuine need - like victims of serious crimes or natural disasters - would not be stranded

Ms Bishop stressed that those in genuine need - like victims of serious crimes or natural disasters - would not be stranded.

But she said some people rort the system, pointing to activists who willfully break the law overseas and then demand help.

'And yet the Australian consular staff are meant to get on a plane and fly to some remote place to bail them out,' she said.

Last year Ms Bishop suggested the government might ask Greenpeace to repay the tens of thousands of dollars spent helping activist Colin Russell get out of a Russian prison.

She's decided not to introduce a cost recovery system for consular services for now, but says it remains a 'live option'. 

1) A traveller who was destitute in Europe refused to return to Australia without their pet bird, which could not be returned for quarantine reasons

2) A mother who wanted the embassy in Bangkok to book accommodation and a return ticket to Australia for her son, then provide an embassy driver to take him to the airport

3) A request from an Australian traveller for DFAT to feed her dogs while she was away

4) 'I'm attending a conference overseas with a large group of Australians but I have heard it is a dangerous city. Can the High Commission arrange for a risk assessment and some armoured cars. We only need them for a week.'

5) Multiple enquiries to embassies overseas seeking the closest pub televising State of Origin games

6) An Australian who had his laptop stolen overseas requested that embassy staff pick him up from the airport, loan him a laptop and provide him with office space for a few days

7) A traveller who asked whether the sand in Egypt would affect her asthma

8) Panicked callers regularly reporting Australian travellers missing overseas, after not hearing from them within the first few hours of arriving in country. Consular officers usually explain that getting through customs and immigration can take time

9) 'Why won't the Australian embassy come and pack my bags for me? I'm an 80 year old architect travelling by myself and too old to pack my own bags'

10) 'I left some items on an aircraft when I changed flights. Can the embassy collect it from the airline lost property?'

11) 'Can the embassy obtain prescription medicine from Australia and send it to me so I can continue my holiday?'

12) Requests for embassies to store luggage, hold mail, provide banking facilities or arrange tours for Australian travellers

13) 'What is the best way to get a polecat out of your roof?'

14) 'I'm going on a cruise. What will the food be like? Can you drink the water on the ship?'

15) Some travellers evacuated from civil unrest in Egypt on government funded flights questioned why they were not entitled to frequent flyer points. Similarly, some travellers evacuated from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami made seat requests, including for first class

16) A caller to DFAT's Consular Emergency Centre wanted to know the average salary for an expat to expect in Thailand

17) 'Does the embassy know if there are any hotels in Phnom Penh with vacant rooms?'

18) 'Can the embassy tell the local police that I have an excellent driving record in Australia and should not have to pay those outstanding speeding fines?'

19) 'What is the best hotel in Phuket?'

20) 'On my last trip to the Philippines I had some trouble with the law. What is the number of the embassy in Manila so I can call them to get me out of jail when I go back?'
