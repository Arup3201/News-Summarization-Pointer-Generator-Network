The banks of the river Thames in Oxfordshire became awash with colour today as the Henley Royal Regatta got underway.

And for once it wasn't the women's fashions brightening up the scene but the men's.

Male rowers and spectators wore bright blazers in a rainbow of shades.

Here come the boys in blazers: Club members show off their natty numbers

Bright: These orange trimmed blazers are certainly eye-catching

Badge of honour: Rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for

Dressed to impress: Of course it's not just the men who wear stylish blazers

Dress code: Men in the Steward's Enclosure must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat

In the pink: This spectator has a cap and blazer matching their boat

The preppy jackets come in stripes and checks with an array of different colours. But while they may make the wearer look dapper, on closer inspection some can be somewhat stained and threadbare.

This is because, according to the oarsmen, they refuse to get them dry cleaned in order to follow the age old tradition of wearing the coffee and beer stains of the past as a 'badge of honour'.

Lengthy issue: Women in the Steward's Enclosure are told that they will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee

On all week: Men arrive for the first day of the races

What it's all about: The Men's VIII from Hitotsubashi University, Japan lift their boat out of the water after winning their Temple Challenge Cup race

Picnic with a view: Spectators enjoy the races in the sunshine

This also explains why some appear to not quite fit, as they have been passed down a family through the generations regardless of if they are the same size.

The stains, missing buttons and patches are all part of what makes the blazers a part of the regatta's 175-year history.

Rowers wear blazers in different colours to show which club or country they compete for. In some cases they are also a clue to the wearer's success on the water due to the insignia, such as stripes on the cuffs.

The men will be showing off their style for the rest of the week as the regatta continues until Sunday. During this time, thousands of people will attend to watch more than 200 races.

Still in style: The event is proud of its 175-year-old traditions

Leisurely afternoon for some: Spectators lounge along the riverbank as the rowers by go

Job done: Rowers carry their oars back from the water, left, while this dog wants to join in the fun, right

Competition: There will be more than 200 races over the course of the regatta

Quintessentially British: The event is a key part of the summer sporting calendar

Last bastion of class: Those headed to the Steward's Enclosure must stick to the rules on dress and use of mobiles

Snapped snapping: A viewer takes a picture of the scene

The regatta has been held ever year since 1839 - except during the two World Wars. The event is often described as the last bastion of class in the British summer season as it has stuck to its quintessential English traditions. A dress code is strictly enforced while more recently, rules have been adopted on the use of mobile phones.

The guidelines for the Steward's Enclosure stipulate that men must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat.

Meanwhile women are told that they should wear dresses or suits and will not be admitted if their skirts do not have a hemline below the knee. Hats are 'customary' but not mandatory. The dress codes states that no-one wearing shorts or jeans will be admitted.

The Henley Royal Regatta website adds: 'Members
 are particularly asked to bring the dress code to the attention of 
their Guests, to ensure that the standards are maintained and to avoid 
the possibility of embarrassment of a Guest being refused admission.'

Set for a fun day: When it comes to women's wear, hats are welcomed but are not  mandatory

Ready to row: Rowers carry their boat from the storage tents

Historic sight: The event has been held in Henley for more than a century

They explain that use of mobile phones is also strictly prohibited 'to
 minimise the inconvenience and annoyance caused to others'.

They write: 'Those seen making or receiving 
calls on their mobile phones will be reminded of this ban by Security 
Guards and Regatta Officials, asked to stop and a note taken of their 
Badge number.  This will allow identification of the responsible Member. If
 the request to stop is ignored, or if the same person is caught a 
second time, then the person will be escorted out of the Enclosure and 
their badge forfeited.'

While they couldn't take selfies or update their Facebook statuses, today's guests did have the British weather on their side so they could enjoy picnics on the river banks as the rowers raced by.
