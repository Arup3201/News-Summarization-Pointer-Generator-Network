A 20-year-old woman from Washington state was charged with cyberstalking after police say she threatened to shoot up Seattle Pacific University because a student there broke up with her.

Samantha Otis allegedly wrote in a text message to her ex-boyfriend that she wanted to 'repeat’ the June 5 rampage at SPU that left one student dead and two others injured.

As a result of the threat, the college went on lockdown at around 2pm on October 31, which was lifted an hour later. Otis was taken into custody outside of Burlington that same day.

Skagit County sheriff's deputies said that Miss Otis told her former flame that she would kill him and his friends, and claimed to be on campus with a gun.

'It was quickly determined she was not anywhere near the campus,' police said.

According to charging documents released to Seattle PI Monday, Otis sent her ex-boyfriend a series of menacing texts beginning October 30 after he failed to contact her.

'Who do I have to kill to get you to answer?' Otis wrote in one message, according to court documents.

In another she said: 'Maybe a loaded gun to your head would make you listen.'

A third missive from Otis cited in the charging papers read: 'I finally understand why the school shooters do it.'

School shooting: The June incident left one student dead and two others wounded

A Seattle Police Department detective stated that the 20-year-old then issued a threat to shoot students as SPU unless her ex got back together with her.

The woman allegedly went so far as to say that she was parked across the street from campus and ready to open fire.

Otis' ex-boyfriend contacted police to report the threat resulting in a brief lockdown. Otis, who was quickly determined to be some 60 miles away from the college, was quickly arrested and hauled off to King County Jail.

She has since been released on $75,000 bail.

The incident served as a frightening reminder of the deadly June 5 shooting in which 26-year-old Aaron Ybarra allegedly walked into a building on campus armed with a shotgun and opened fire.

Ybarra has been charged with premeditated murder and attempted murder in what prosecutors said was part of a long-planned act of mass violence.
