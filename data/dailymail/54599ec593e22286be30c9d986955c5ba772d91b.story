Tributes poured in for Bob Torrance after one of the greatest golf coaches in the history of the game 
lost his short battle with cancer, aged 82.

Torrance, father of Ryder
 Cup-winning captain Sam and coach to many of the world’s best players 
down the decades, passed away peacefully in his sleep at home in Largs on Friday.

Former pupil Marc Warren, speaking after a 68 put him on 
The Open leaderboard at Hoylake yesterday, said: ‘I wouldn’t be top 10 
in The Open if it hadn’t been for Bob.

‘It’s a sad day for golf. A legend has passed away. He changed my career massively. Still to this day, and for the rest of my career, his words of wisdom will stay with me.

‘I can’t speak highly enough of him and his knowledge of the golf swing. He would give everything he had to make you the best player you could be. I’ll be forever in his debt for that.

‘I hit a great drive off 18 today and the wind was really kind to me. It might have been Bob helping me out.’

Fellow Open competitor Stephen Gallacher echoed the sentiments of the many who had received tutelage from Torrance, saying: ‘He was a massive influence on my career from a young age. He was like a father figure to me. Everything I know about the game is probably through Bob.

‘The first time I met him was down at Inverclyde and the snow was hitting the back of the bay. He was such a positive guy and I loved working with him.

‘I went 
down to see him two or three weeks ago and it was sad to see him. I 
really feel for June, Sam and the rest of the family.

‘I’ve
 got millions of stories about him. He was larger than life. He was 
always positive — and funny, too. He would teach you for as long as you 
wanted to be there — even if it was in the dark.

‘Bob
 was one of the hardest workers I have ever known. He had an eye for a 
golf swing and knew how to fix it without becoming too technical.

‘He was never one for using a camera — he just used his eyes. He also had such a knowledge of the game.

‘Bob’s
 seen it all and done it all. Working with Ian Woosnam, for instance, 
and Sam, of course. He also went to see Ben Hogan, so he knew what he 
was talking about.

‘I probably wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for working with Bob over the years.’

Many
 friends and former pupils took to social media to pay instant tribute, 
Ryder Cup legend Ian Poulter Tweeting: ‘Really sad news Bob Torrance 
just passed away. An amazing man who coached so many great players, 
he’ll be missed.’

Scotland’s Chris Doak added: ‘Farewell my old pal I’ll remember you always.’

Triple major winner Padraig Harrington and European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley also paid tributes to Torrance on Saturday morning.

'He was the greatest golf coach in the world and he was a father figure to me after my own dad passed away,' the 42-year-old said.

'My majors would never have happened without Bob. Not a chance. But I don't think anybody should have any regrets because Bob lived a full life.'

Fellow Irishman McGinley, coached by Torrance for more than 20 years, echoed Harrington's views.

'We have lost one of life's, as well as one of golf's, true characters,' said the 47-year-old Dubliner.

'I feel blessed to have known Bob for many years and to have had him as my coach since 1992. Not only was he a world class golf coach, a fact recognised right across the game, but he was also one of my very favourite people in life.'
