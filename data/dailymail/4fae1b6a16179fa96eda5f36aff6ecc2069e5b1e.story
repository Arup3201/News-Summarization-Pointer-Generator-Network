Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, has reportedly rekindled his romance with his ex-wife.

Mr Ashley, 49,  divorced Linda Ashley, 46, in 2003 at a cost of £50million, but the business tycoon is said to be dating his ex-wife again.

Friends are said to have told  The Sun that the pair have been seen enjoying a string of outings, and also spotted them together at Mr Ashley's lavish £25million Hertfordshire mansion.

The couple were pictured leaving an Indian restaurant together in 2011 suggesting a reconciliation has been on the cards for sometime.

Proposing again? Friends of Mr Ashley, the billionaire Newcastle United owner, have suggested that a rekindled romance with his ex-wife Linda is going so well that he may propose again

Sources close to the billionaire, who owns a majority stake in retailer Sports Direct, added that Mr Ashley is even considering making another marriage proposal.

Back on the scene? Ex-wife Linda Ashley who Ashley divorced quietly 11 years ago

Some said he is so pleased with how the relationship is going that he has lost weight.

There has been previous speculation about the two rekindling their love before, after they were spotted out on the town in 2011.

They were seen in September 2011 enjoying a meal together at an Indian restaurant in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, after arriving in a chauffeur-driven black Bentley.

At the time a friend told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mike never wanted to lose Linda in the first place. He adores her and always has. They've found their spark again.

'He's happy, she’s happy, and to the amazement of people who know them, Mike and Linda are now getting back ­together.'

The relationship then failed to materialise.

Ms and Mr Ashley met while the former was working at the Lilywhites sports outlet in London, part of the tycoon's business empire.

Swedish Ms Ashley married her ex-husband in a ceremony in Gothenburg in 1989, divorcing him 14 years later.

Despite his huge wealth today, Mr Ashley grew up in a small bungalow in Buckinghamshire, where his parents still live.

But after a grammar school education, his business acumen led to him accumulating a huge empire worth billions. 

He bought Newcastle United for £134million in 2007. The reclusive billionaire - ranked 23 in the Sunday Times Rich List - rarely speaks publicly.

According to the newspaper, his worth rocketed £1.45billion in the past year, making him worth an estimated £3.75billion.

The figure is likely to have increased further still in recent weeks after the share value of Sports Direct rocketed by around 40p. He also secured enough support from within the company to grant himself a hefty £200million bonus.

MailOnline has contacted a spokesman for Mr Ashley for comment.
