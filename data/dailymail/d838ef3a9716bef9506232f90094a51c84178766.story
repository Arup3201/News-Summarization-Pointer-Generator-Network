For the majority of Europe's royals, an official car and a team made up of a squad of protection officers and at least one flunky are essential when carrying out official engagements.

Not so Spain's Queen Letizia, who chose to walk from her home at the Zarzuela Palace to a meeting in Madrid this morning.

Accompanied by a single bodyguard, the 42-year-old royal arrived in a similarly low-key ensemble comprised of a pair of tailored trousers and a tailored red wool coat.

Low key: Spain's Queen Letizia arrives on foot for the board meeting of FEDER in Madrid this morning

Letizia was attending the board meeting of FEDER, the Spanish Federation of Rare Diseases - a body that has found itself called into action more often than usual of late, thanks to Spain's two Ebola victims.

Despite the serious subject matter, the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left.

The meeting with FEDER is a bit of a departure for Letizia who, until now, has focused her efforts on championing Spanish culture and the plight of disabled people, although latterly, health has become something of a preoccupation.

Last week, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president.

A day later and she was back on the cultural beat, joining husband King Felipe for the opening of a museum in Pamplona.

No car: The Spanish royal, 42, was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard

Concern: Letizia has championed more health initiatives of late and was with a cancer charity last week

During the couple's tour of Museum of the University of Navarra, they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of Spanish greats, among them Pablo Picasso.

Letizia's latest meeting comes shortly after the Spanish royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king Juan Carlos has come forward.

Ingrid Sartiau, 47, has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the Spanish Supreme Court - if she can prove her story is true.

According to Ms Sartiau, she is the product of a three-night liaison between her mother Liliane, a Belgian governess, and the now 76-year-old royal in 1966. 

Although by then a married 28-year-old father of two, an affair would hardly have been out of character for Juan-Carlos.

Feeling the cold? Letizia kept her tailored dark red wool jacket on throughout the meeting

Glamorous: She teamed her businesslike look with Links of London 'Hope' egg earrings

Throughout his marriage 'Don Juan' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women, including an alleged affair with Princess Diana while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986.

Ms Sartiau herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years, only being told his name in 2011.

Although Spanish courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests, Juan-Carlos' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt. 

Looking cool: Letizia donned a pair of stylish aviator sunglasses as she made her exit

Busy: The end of last week saw Letizia travel to Pamplona for the opening of a new museum

Culture: The Spanish royal has long been an enthusiastic champion of Spanish culture and the arts

Interesting: She and King Felipe were shown a contemporary art exhibition that included works by Picasso
