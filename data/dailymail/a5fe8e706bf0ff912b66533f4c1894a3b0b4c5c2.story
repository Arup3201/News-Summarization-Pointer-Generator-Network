An iPhone belonging to an Oklahoma man that went missing in October 2013 was returned to its owner this month - after it was recovered in Japan.

Farmer Kevin Whitney told KFOR the story of how his phone fell into his grain pit in Chickasha, Oklahoma and went around the the world.

'I had it in my pocket and I bent over to work on a copper bottom door and it fell out of my pocket into my grain pit and went up the elevator,' he said.

'I thought "I'll never see that phone again,"' Whitney also said.

KFOR reports that Whitney's phone - which was hidden inside 'a bin full of 280,000 pounds of grain' -Â  eventually reached Japan.

Whitney told the affiliate station he recently received a phone call that his phone was recovered.

'The man on the other end said, "Is this Kevin Whitney?" I said "Yeah, this is Kevin." He said, "Did you lose a cell phone?" I said "Yeah, I lost a cell phone last fall."'

Whitney's phone was returned by a Japanese grain mill worker, KFOR reported.
