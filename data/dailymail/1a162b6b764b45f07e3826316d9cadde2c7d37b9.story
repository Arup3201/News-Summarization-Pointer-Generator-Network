It sounds like a great idea to avoid sky-high parking charges - leave your car on a residential road for free then take a short taxi ride to the airport.

But the families near London Stansted Airport whose streets are being clogged up by cars and vans aren't so impressed - and are taking a stand.

Residents in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, have covered the vehicles with signs saying: ‘Another Stansted traveller enjoying free parking.’

Message: Drivers going to the airport have been spotted leaving their cars on Heath Row for up to six weeks and using a taxi to get to and from the road

Drivers going to the airport have been spotted leaving their cars on Heath Row for up to six weeks and using a taxi to get to and from the road.

It helps them avoid huge charges of up to £16.50 per day in the mid-stay or £15 in the long-stay airport car parks when jetting off.

Cllr Colin Woodward, from East Hertfordshire District Council, spotted the angry signs today and said he could see why locals were upset.

He added: ‘I can understand their frustration. Parking is a hugely controversial issue in our town.

Car park: Short-stay Stansted parking is £36 per day, but much cheaper when staying for a few hours, while fast-track is £60 per day and 'pick-up' rates are £70 per day

‘But the police and district council cannot do anything about it unless the vehicles are blocking driveways, parking illegally or do not have valid tax.

‘I suggest residents report their concerns to the airport.’

Short-stay parking is £36 per day, but much cheaper when staying for a few hours, while fast-track is £60 per day and ‘pick-up’ rates are £70 per day.

Long-stay parking at the airport has a drive-up price of £15 per day, while mid-stay is £16.50 per day, although discounts apply when pre-booking.

For example, a one-week long-stay from tomorrow that is booked today costs £62 instead of £90 on the day, while a two-week would be £109 instead of £195.

Police and district council can't do anything as it's a perfectly legal act
