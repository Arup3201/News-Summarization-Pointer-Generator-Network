South Africans are preparing to say goodbye to Nelson Mandela, as his daughter said the family would let God decide when it is time for him to go.

Former president Mr Mandela, 94, is in a ‘critical’ condition in intensive care at a Pretoria hospital after a sudden deterioration in his health, and the country was warned not to hold out ‘false hopes’ for a significant improvement.

It is not known whether Mr Mandela is on life-support but his daughter, Makaziwe, said the  family will not end his medical treatment and only God can decide when his time has come to die.

We will not release him: Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe said his family will let God decide when the leader dies and they will not 'release him'

She added: ‘In our culture, the Tembu culture, you never release the  person unless the person has told you, “please, my children, my  family – release me”.

‘These people who want to talk about, you know, releasing him, he hasn’t said we should release him and we haven’t come to the end yet. It is only God who knows the end.’

She added: ‘I believe he is at peace. He is at peace with himself. He has given so much to the world I believe he is at peace.

‘This is a sacred time for us, and I would expect the world to really back off and leave us alone.’ Mr Mandela’s granddaughter Ndileka added: ‘His fighting spirit is what amazes me. I don’t know what keeps him fighting and he is stoic and determined that he will end things his way. Not any other person’s way.

‘I strongly feel that whatever covenant he has made with his ancestors and God has not been fulfilled – when that is fulfilled, he will bow out in a way that he chooses.’

Mr Mandela’s deterioration this weekend has caused a perceptible switch in mood from prayers for recovery to preparations for a fond farewell among South Africa’s 53million residents.

There is concern about doctors trying to prolong the life of South Africa’s first black president, one of the 20th century’s most influential figures.

President Jacob Zuma, who visited Mr Mandela on Sunday, reflected the national mood when he told a news conference that the ex-leader remained critical.

He said: ‘All of us in the country must accept that Madiba [Mandela’s clan name] is now old. As he ages, his health will trouble him.’

Pressed
 for further details on Nelson Mandela's health, President Jacob Zuma 
said: 'I can't tell you what is wrong with him ... I am not a doctor'.

Despite previous claims that Mr 
Mandela’s health had been improving after battling a recurring lung 
infection, it emerged in the early hours of Saturday that he had become 
unresponsive.

It was reported that his liver and kidney functions were down to 50 per cent and he had not opened his eyes for days.

Mr Mandela recently underwent two 
procedures at Pretoria Hospital, one to repair a bleeding ulcer and 
another to insert a tube into his body.

Legacy: Mandela has been vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting tuberculosis during his 27 years behind bars under apartheid.

It followed revelations that the 
ambulance which took Mr Mandela to Pretoria hospital earlier this month 
broke down en route, leaving him stranded on the roadside for 40 minutes
 in winter temperatures.

South
 African government officials have said ‘great care was taken to ensure 
that Mandela’s health was not compromised and that his doctors were 
satisfied the former president suffered no harm.’

Mr Mandela, who became South Africa’s first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was hospitalised on June 8.

He is revered for leading the fight 
against white minority rule in South Africa and then preaching 
reconciliation despite being imprisoned for 27 years.

He left power after five years as President.

The illness that has plagued the 
Nobel Peace Prize winner in recent years is believed to stem from damage
 to his lungs which he suffered while working in a prison quarry.

He contracted tuberculosis in the 1980s while being held in jail on the notorious Robben Island.

Mandela has been hospitalised four times since December but last night’s
 confirmation of his grave condition is by far the most downbeat report 
ever given about his health.

Mandela has been undergoing hospital 
treatment since June 8 although all official statements had until last 
night described his condition as stable.

The status of Mr Mandela is likely to overshadow the visit later this week to South Africa by US President Barack Obama.
