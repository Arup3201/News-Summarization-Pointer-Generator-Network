Tired of trying to tempt your children into a plate of greens? Well one supermarket suggests you try a more colourful approach.

Tesco is hoping to give exasperated parents a helping hand in getting their youngsters to eat beetroot with their latest launch, the sweetroot.

Beetroots are known to be a superfood packed with nutritional benefits but they are also notoriously unpopular with children.

Tesco are launching two new vibrant varieties of beetroot in a hope to encourage children to eat them

Traditionally beetroot has suffered from a so-called 'Marmite syndrome', with people 50 and above enjoying it and the younger generation disliking it.

It has seen a resurgence recently, but it is the juice variety that is seeing rocketing sales rather than the raw vegetable.

However, Tesco are hoping to change this when they launch a sweeter version of the root exclusively across UK stores tomorrow.

The supermarket giant will be offering two long-lost varieties, the organic candy stripe beetroot and the golden beetroot. 

The candy stripe variety is officially called Chiogga and is named after the northern Italian coastal town where it was first cultivated in the early 1800s.

Beetroot has traditionally suffered from 'marmite syndrome' with the younger generation disliking it 

The golden beetroot is a Victorian variety that also goes by the name of Burpee's golden, after the American seed house where it was first grown.

The colourful veg is said to have a sweeter flavour than the dark purple original and this combined with the bright appearance is said to encourage children to eat them.

Tesco beetroot buyer Ravi Patel says he understands the struggle that parents go through when it comes to meal times but hopes their Candy Stripe Beetroot can help.

'Every parent knows that getting youngsters to eat vegetables is never easy but we believe that the Candy Stripe variety will help make that dinner time task a lot simpler.

'We've worked with our main beetroot grower to see how we could encourage more people to enjoy this wonderful vegetable and discovered that this sweeter Candy Stripe variety had generally been forgotten about and never been grown on a commercial scale before.

The Candy Stripe Beetroot is said to taste sweeter than the traditional deep purple root 

'It looks and tastes absolutely wonderful and will definitely also bring a lot of colour and fun to the dinner table.'

The new varieties have been grown by the UK's biggest producers of beetroot, Gs, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, which offers perfect growing conditions of soil, sun and water to produce a sweet, full-flavoured root.

G's managing director Anthony Gardiner says that these new vegetables should be enough to add a little excitement to children's meal times. 

'We were specifically looking for varieties of beetroot that would excite the palates of a new audience of shoppers seeking healthy foods.

'We know that beetroot is becoming more popular but thought that if we could add a sweeter profile as well as introducing different coloured varieties we could help widen this wonderful vegetable's appeal.' 

Ravi added that he hopes the new take on the unpopular veg will encourage a whole new generation of fans of the root.

'We're hoping that both these varieties will appeal to a whole new audience.'

Both varieties will be sold in 450 gram packs and will cost £1.50 each.
