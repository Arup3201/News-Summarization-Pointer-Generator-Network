It may officially be spring but it would be foolhardy for those living on the East Coast to pack away their winter coats, as an icy storm is predicted to hit next week.

The weather pattern, known as a 'bomb' by meteorologists, is due to hit on Tuesday night, and could dump up to six inches of snow in New York City, Washington DC and Boston.

Temperatures are also predicted to plummet to a level more common for mid-January rather than late March.

The storm is still gathering strength as it moves from the Gulf of Mexico, making it hard to predict how many states will be affected.

Currently, it could bring snow across a swathe of states, from Virginia to New England.

While the snow isn't expected to fall until mid-week, the frigid temperatures will arrive far sooner, with freezing conditions starting Sunday.

The temperatures, at 10 to 35 degrees lower than average for this time of year, will be 'more fitting of mid-January' New York Magazine reported.

The snow and big freeze will be accompanied by strong winds that could lead to coastal flooding.

As well as creating treacherous driving conditions, the late-season storm is likely to create other hazards.

'Where heavy wet snow falls on areas where trees are budding and blossoming in the South, there is a greater risk of downed tree limbs and power outages with the storm,' AccuWeather's chief operating officer Evan Myers said.
