It took until the end of December before Neil Warnock became the first Barclays Premier League manager sacked this season but the overall trend towards greater managerial instability still deepens, especially at Championship clubs.

Across the top four tiers of English football, there were 34 managerial changes and 27 dismissals between the start of the season and December 31.

This beats the previous high of 24, set last season – and there were 12 dismissals in the Championship, which is also a record, five more than in the previous two years.

The numbers may be warped by unusual goings on at Watford (four different managers this season) and Leeds (three) but this season is on course to create a new record of managerial departures, set at 46 in 2006-07.

One of the most disturbing trends for the League Managers Association, which released these figures today as part of its quarterly review, is that those managers dismissed during the current campaign were only in their jobs for an average of 1.04 years.

The average for those sacked in the top three tiers has been less than a year. 

Mark Yeates, fired from Cheltenham after nearly five years, and Paul Cox, who departed Mansfield after more than three, boosted the average tenure figures in League Two.

Thirteen of the 27 dismissals have been managers serving for the first time in the top four divisions of English football. Will they return to the job? Really, why would you? 

Mansfield's Paul Cox was at the club for three years, bucking the trend for length of tenure
