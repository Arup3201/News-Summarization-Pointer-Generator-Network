About half of all mosques and Muslim centres in Britain have been subjected to Islamophobic attacks since 9/11, it has been revealed.

The figures, from the Islamophobia watchdog Tell Mama, found that between 40 and 60 per cent of mosques 
and other Islamic centres - about 700 - have been targeted in Britain since the 2001 attack on New York's World Trade Center.

It comes as English Defence League supporters prepare to gather in Woolwich at the scene of Drummer Lee Rigby's murder later this afternoon.

Drummer Rigby was hacked to death in front of horrified on-lookers in south-east London last month.

The number of anti-Islamic attacks has gone up significantly since the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in south east London in May

Report author Professor Nigel Copsey, of
 Teesside University, said: 'What is 
significant about our analysis is the extent to which the far right is 
implicated in anti-Muslim hate crime.'

Research by the Independent newspaper also found almost a tenfold increase in attacks in the days after Drummer Rigby's death, with mosques being set 
alight and Muslims targeted at home.

There were nearly nine attacks per day in the immediate aftermath of the killing, 
settling back to around two per day over in the following weeks.

Professor Copsey said: 'There has undoubtedly been a spike in anti-Muslim incidents since the Woolwich murder.

'An obvious concern now is whether the 
number of hate crime incidents return to "normal" levels or whether 
Woolwich has been a game-changer in terms of increasing the underlying 
incidence of anti-Muslim hate over the longer term.'

Earlier this week, swastikas and 
the letters 'EDL', 'KKK' and 'NF' were sprayed on the walls of a mosque 
in Redditch.

There were also reports of pigs’ heads being left at Muslim
 families’ homes and other attacks against individuals.

In addition, there was an
 attack on an Islamic centre in north London.

Despite the warning signs, a senior 
Government adviser told the paper there remains a 'lack of political 
will' to take on the issue and identified Secretary of State for 
Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles as one of the ministers 
slow to react to the problem.

The adviser, who did not want to be 
named, said attempts to 'tackle this issue – even before Woolwich – 
struggled to attract buy-in'.

The Muslim community was warned yesterday of the dangers it faces from hate groups in a sermon delivered at 500 mosques.

The
 piece said high-profile cases of sexual grooming of children by small 
groups of Muslim men 'hitting the headlines in a short space of time and
 the fallout from the Woolwich case will create a major challenge for 
the Muslim community'.

English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been banned from staging a protest march with supporters in Woolwich today

But
 Dr Matthew Goodwin, associate fellow at Chatham House and an expert on 
extremist groups, said: 'The broader picture is more positive than 
we think. Young people are more at ease accepting Muslims in society.'

A
 spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:
 'There is no place for anti-Muslim hatred or any kind of hatred in 
Britain, and we are committed to tackling this unacceptable scourge.'

The
 revelations came ahead of today's EDL march, which was set to route 
past the East London Mosque and assemble outside Woolwich Barracks.

But police have imposed conditions on 
the protest and the march will now take place between Hyde Park Corner 
and end opposite the House of Lords, where supporters will be allowed to
 loiter for a maximum of two hours.

Any supporters seen gathering in Woolwich will be arrested, the Metropolitan Police said.

As
 well as laying flowers in memory of Drummer Rigby in Woolwich, EDL leader Tommy 
Robinson and his co-leader Kevin Carroll had planned to walk to raise 
money for a young girl fighting against neuroblastoma.

Reacting
 to the Met's decision, Mr Robinson said: 'The police are enforcing 
no-go zones for non-Muslims. It's a charity walk with two people taking 
part.

'When has a Muslim charity walk ever been made to have conditions?'
