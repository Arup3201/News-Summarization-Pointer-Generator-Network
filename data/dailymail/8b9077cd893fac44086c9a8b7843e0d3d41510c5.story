The revival of the crop top this summer struck fear into the hearts of women everywhere, but supermodel Miranda Kerr no doubt rejoiced.

And it is easy to see why as she shows off her impossibly taught and toned stomach of the front cover of the latest issue of Elle Korea magazine.

Wearing a flared long-sleeved crop top and with her slim legs on display under a pair of tiny black hot pants with white trim the Australian looks stunning as she gazes into the camera with one hand nonchalantly on one hip.

Her long brunette locks are flowing gently out behind her as if caught in a gust of a wind and her lips give a pop of colour to the look in a bright fuchsia colour.

Her fingers, with nails painted bright red, are adorned with numerous rings and she has a simple band bracelet on her left wrist, but otherwise accessorizes on the shoot seem to have been kept to a minimum.

Miranda may have recently ended her contract with Victoria Secret, but her recent work shows her body is still definitely catwalk ready.

Anyone for tea? Miranda Kerr posted a sexy snap of herself posing in a bra and underwear set last Wednesday

Miranda proved that she isn't always in revealing outfits, posting this cute bedtime picture on her instagram

She
was recently featured in Net-a-Porter’s web magazine The Edit, looking 
incredible modelling an array of beachwear by various different 
designers as it was announced that she is the new lifestyle editor for 
the online glossy.

Miranda, who also has her own beauty line Kora Organics, says she's excited about the change in the direction of her career.

'I am really enjoying having a more active role in everything I am doing,' she says.

'Being creatively involved, being strategic about the projects I take, making sure that they are in line with me and my brand.'

Miranda was seen out looking every inch the super model in New York two days ago as she embarks on a new chapter in her impressive career following the end of her contract with Victoria's Secret

KORA
organics is a totally organic range of skincare that Miranda says ‘is a
reflection of my passion for living a healthy, organic lifestyle.’

The 30-year-old is well known for her super healthy lifestyle, often tweeting about her juices and smoothies.

Miranda recently posted a lifestyle video she made for Net-a-Porter, titled The Body Beautiful.

'Boys like their cars, I like my Vitamix,' Miranda tells the camera.

'[My
morning shake] is for maximum energy and vitality. It's a power 
smoothie that's really alkalising, nutrient dense and high in vitamins 
and minerals.'

The mother-of-two shared this intimate snap of her on the swings with her son Flynn with her fans

The healthy 
green smoothie consists of coconut water, cold-pressed coconut milk, 
acai powder, goji berries, spirulina, raw cacao powder, chia seeds, and 
vegan rice powder.

And, as the Elle cover would suggest she is proud of the results her lifestyle has had on her near-perfect body.

Just last week he 30-year-old Australian supermodel showed off her famous figure in just a sexy lacy bra and underwear set as she posed on a balcony by the sea.

Miranda's husband Orlando Bloom will be arriving in New York soon, as he is set to star alongside Tony Award nominee Condola Rashad in the latest revival of Romeo and Juliet on Broadway which opens in August.
