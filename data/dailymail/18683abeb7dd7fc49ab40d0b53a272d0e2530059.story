Connecting to WiFi, knowing how to use Google and tuning HD TVs were listed today as some of the most useful skills of modern life.

In a survey which polled 2,000 adults, using a self-service checkout,online banking and operating satnav replaced talents such as knitting and baking to be named the most 'essential' capabilities in British culture.

Only 10 of the 50 most important skills didn't involve modern technology, with cooking and using a calculator among them, while participants counted sewing and letter writing as skills that are no longer needed.

Knowing how to use Google was top of the list of 50 essential life skills, with most modern daily tasks requiring the use of a computer. Posed by model

Other 'essential skills' included using Google maps and knowing how to navigate social media sites such as Facebook. 

Writing postcards and needing to know friends and relatives’ phone numbers are also among the ‘redundant’ skills which people no longer consider necessary. 

A spokesman for touch-typing course www.kaz-type.com, who carried out the poll said: 'For generations, there are skills which have been passed down from parent to child, because they were deemed so essential to everyday life.

Online banking was listed as the fourth most important skill in the list which polled 2,000 British adults

Cooking was considered the fifth most important skill in the poll after using google and mobile phones

'However, it seems technology is wiping out some of those skills as gadgets can now do it for us.

'The internet has become such a huge part of life that it’s so important to know how to use it, while built-in address books on mobile phones mean we no longer have to memorise the phone numbers of loved ones.

'It does seem that there are some 
skills which are standing the test of time though - knowing how to cook 
and touch-typing are things people have needed to know as much now as 
they did in previous years.

'If
anything, touch-typing is only becoming more important over time as so 
many careers now rely on computers more than ever for their day-to-day 
work.'

Knowing which bins to put rubbish into at home and how to use satnav (posed by model) were also listed

Using a calculator and working a mobile phone were among the top 10 most useful skills listed

'Being able to search the internet was named life’s most essential skill, followed by operating a mobile phone and connecting a device to WiFi.

Learning how to manage your bank account online came fourth, while the classic skill of being able to cook was at five.

Knowing how to turn off water at the mains was voted life’s sixth most essential skill, followed by knowing what rubbish goes into which bin and how to set online privacy settings.

Using a calculator and knowing how to operate self-service checkouts in supermarkets completed the top ten.

Other ‘essential’ skills in the list included being able to set and follow a route on a sat-nav, using discount voucher websites, downloading music and tuning HD TVs.

Series-linking TV shows, buying and selling via online auction websites and communicating via Skype also featured in the top 50.

Working self-service check out was considered an important skill coming in at number 10 on the list

Connecting to Sky/Cable channels or setting progammes to record on 'series link' were the 32nd and 34th most essential skill listed

In comparison, darning has been named the skill least likely to be used in modern life, closely followed by knitting and being able to polish brass or silver.

Baking bread from scratch has been replaced by modern day bread makers, while putting up a tent has been also deemed as ‘no longer essential’.

Servicing the car yourself and understanding how to work out pounds and ounces are also among the list.

Six in ten Brits polled admitted they would struggle to do some of the ‘outdated’ skills.

Baking fresh bread and knitting were no longer considered important talents having been replaced with more technology based skills

Another 65 per cent believe many of these skills are irrelevant to modern day life because gadgets now do so many of them for us.

However, 85 per cent of Brits think modern technology has simply changed the skills we need, with a third believing we are actually more skilled that previous generations.

Only one in 10 people believe gadgets have led to people having fewer skills nowadays.

The spokesman for website added: 'The survey confirms our own findings that touch typing is more important for education and job prospects than ever before - there are few jobs today where a keyboard doesn’t play a part.

'Like all essential life skills - whether it’s cooking or using a phone - learning to type has been updated and simplified for the 21st century.

Researches believed technological advances have replaced old fashioned skills, such as Google Maps (12th on the list) which plans a route at the push of a button.
