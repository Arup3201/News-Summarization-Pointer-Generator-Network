Peter Holmes a Court has married his fiancee, American photographer Alissa Everett, in Botswana following the African train crash tragedy in which one of their wedding guests were killed.

The millionaire Australian businessman has posted a message to 'our friends' on his Facebook page about the wedding and included a photograph of his bride's bruised and stitched hand.

He has also paid tribute to American Will Poovey, who died in the crash, saying his new wife loved the 44-year-old 'like a brother'.

Ms Everett also posted on Facebook about Mr Poovey and his wife Kara who was injured in the crash: 'Their love over 18 years of marriage was an inspiration for me. Perhaps I hadn't got married because I hadn't met my Will Poovey'.

The newlyweds photographed their ceremony, and Ms Everett's injured hand, using the late Mr Poovey's camera - with the permission of his widow, Kara Poovey.

The Facebook message reads, 'We would like our friends to know to following.

'We are happy to be married, yet our hearts are broken for the loss of our dear friend.

'We were involved in an accident in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe when our tourist tram was hit by a goods train. 20 people were injured, two serious, and one died as a result of the injury.

'We are OK. Bruised, cut, stitched and strapped. These will fade and heal.

'Many others were hurt worse than us and, as a group, we were very, very lucky.

'On that tragic night, we witnessed so much bravery, but the world lost one of its best in Will Poovey. Alissa loved him like a brother, and Peter is honored that he had blessed our union.

'His wife Kara—as Will well knew—is an angel on this earth with us. She had a small operation in Johannesburg and continues to light up the room with her teary smile.

Peter Holmes a Court and Alissa Everett (pictured) had asked guests to donate gifts to build houses for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of which will be named in honour of American Willl Poovey who died in the crash

African media ran pictures of the freight train which crashed into the tourist tram carrying Peter Holmes a Court's wedding guests in Zimbabwe on Tuesday, July 1

'The tragic events has given us such incredible respect for Kara, and we send our love to Kara, Carson and Coco Poovey.

'Kara requested that we rejoin our group in Botswana and gave us Will’s camera. She insisted we honor Will by following through with our wedding ceremony and filling the camera with beautiful photographs.

'The wedding took place as planned, smaller and quieter without Will. Good will come from this if we rise to the challenge of living life as Will did: making the most of every day, adding laughter and joy to every room we enter, and deeply loving those close to us.

'Guests and friends of the wedding have already raised over $17,000 to fund Safe Houses in DR Congo for survivors of sexual violence. One of the houses will be dedicated in the name of the Poovey family.

'We’ll take our honeymoon next year, when smiles come easier.'

Millionaire Jason Gissing, who was to be Holmes a Court's best man, was flown to South Africa after breaking his arm and a leg in the crash

The crash happened on July 1 when a goods train ploughed into a National Railways of Zimbabwe tram that was carrying 30 tourists and 5 crew members at the Victoria Falls main station.

He said the passengers on the tram were from the US, UK, the Netherlands and Australia.

They were staying at the Victoria Falls Hotel at the time of the accident and sightseeing ahead of the wedding.

Of the 20 injured, 18 were treated at the local hospital and two were flown to a hospital in Johannesberg where one of them died.

The best man of Mr Holmes a Court, Jason Gissing, is a friend from his Oxford University days, where he also met George Osborne, Britain's finance minister.

His family has close ties with Zimbabwe - Mr Holmes a Court's father, the late entrepreneur Robert, grew up in the African country.

'It is the most appalling disaster,' an associate of Mr Gissing said.

'Jason broke an arm and a leg. It’s very traumatic, but at least he is alive.

'He is being cared for by Professor Ken Boffard, who is one of the best trauma surgeons in the world.'

Mr Gissing was airlifted to Johannesburg, in neighbouring South Africa, for treatment.

Ms Everett is an award-winning American photographer who has covered conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Peter Holmes a Court (right, with Russell Crowe) is cancelled his wedding after the train crash in Zimbabwe, but has since quietly married Alissa Everett in Botswana

Last year she photographed Peter Holmes a Court for a magazine article about his return to Zimbabwe to trace the history of his father, Robert, who died in 1990.

For their wedding gifts, she and Peter Holmes a Court asked that guests give monetary donations to a charity Ms Everett founded for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Prior to getting married in Zimbabwe, Holmes a Court intended to accompany Ms Everett on a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in 2012 she was 'violently ambushed'.

'I will be joining to carry her (heavy) camera bags, to write on her work, raise the profile of the projects and because I am not prepared to let my bride out of my sight,' he said in a post on their wedding gift registry site.

Mr Holmes a Court became executive chairman of South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2006 in a joint takeover with Gladiator star Russell Crowe.

After becoming CEO, he quit the post in 2008. He and Crowe currently own a 37.5 per cent share of the NRL club.

His close friend Mr Gissing, 43, is the co-founder of UK-based online grocer Ocado.  He stepped down from the board earlier this year, cashing in $27 million worth of shares.

Mr Gissing is married to Norwegian former professional skier Katinka. They live in a $8 million house in London’s Bayswater with their four children.

Zimbabwe’s railways are notoriously dangerous, with ageing despot Robert Mugabe having brought the country’s economy to its knees and unable to pay for improvements. The accident is the third involving National Railways of Zimbabwe in the space of a week.

The National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman declined to comment on whether legal action had been launched against it following the crash.
