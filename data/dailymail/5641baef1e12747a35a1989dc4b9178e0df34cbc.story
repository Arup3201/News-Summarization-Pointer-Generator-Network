The gloomy weather might be taking its toll on the nation's mood - but as the Queen watched her horse win a top prize at the Royal Windsor Horse Show this morning, it was clear she was not going to let a bit of rain dampen her spirits.

Looking remarkably cheerful as she enjoyed the day's events in the grounds of Windsor castle, the Queen was in her element.

The monarch's horse, Balmoral Erica, scored a victory in the Highland Championship in the Copper Ring at today's event. 

In her element: The Queen looked delighted as she walked through the grounds of Windsor castle to watch her horses show at the Royal Windsor Horse Show today

Pleased as punch, the Queen celebrates her win

And wrapped up against the chill in a 
chic paisley body warmer with a silk scarf tied jauntily under her chin,
the monarch was the picture of rural elegance.

Donning Wellington boots to traipse across
the wet grass to watch her horses perform in the Royal Windsor Horse 
show, the Queen looked in her element, engaging enthusiastically with 
her fellow attendees.

The monarch was no doubt delighted 
that the event - Britain's largest outdoor equestrian event - was able to go ahead, after the previous days had
been blighted by rain.

A statement went out on the event's 
website this morning assuring visitors that following this morning's 
sunshine, the day's events would go ahead as scheduled, despite adverse 
weather conditions experienced over the first two days. 

'The organisers continue to work tirelessly to ensure the best possible conditions for visitors and competitors,' they said.

However, as the park's grassy areas 
were left waterlogged by the downpours, visitors were urged to take 
public transport to the event - or join the Queen in arriving on foot.

The event, which has been running for more than 65 years and takes place in The Queen’s private grounds at Windsor Castle, has two more days to run - but organisers say they expecting the last two days to be bright and sunny.

Jolly good show! It was welly boots and a wool 
skirt for the Queen, as she enjoyed a rare sunny break from the adverse 
weather conditions that have plagued the show over the past two days

The adverse weather conditions over the past week meant the Royal park had been turned into a bog, meaning competitors struggled to get their  horseboxes into the venue

Workers at the park had to pump gallons of water out of the area in an attempt at drying out the land
