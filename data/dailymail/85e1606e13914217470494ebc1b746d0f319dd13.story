A 16-year-old boy who tried to incite a riot on Facebook has been told he faces jail after his anonymity was taken away by a judge.

Johnny Melfah posted messages on a group online called 'Letz start a riot'.

After a judge lifted his right to keep his identity secret yesterday he admitted the offences today - and was warned he would face jail.

Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, were last week jailed for four years after creating Facebook 
pages that urged rioting in their home towns.

Accused: Johnny Melfah, 16, left, allegedly posted messages on the Facebook group 'Letz start a riot' which Danny Cook, 21, right, is accused of creating

Melfah, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, is thought to be the first child in the country charged in connection with rioting to be publicly identified even though he had not entered a plea.

Today he pleaded guilty to intentionally 
encouraging or assisting the commission of widespread thefts and 
criminal damage, in a 20 minute hearing at Worcester Youth Court.

He was warned by Magistrate Linda Griffin: 'I will be asking that the pre-sentence report looks at all possible options, including a custodial sentence.'

Yesterday at Worcester Magistrates' Court a JP lifted an anonymity order and ruled identifying Melfah is in the public interest.

An alleged looter was arrested after police officers followed a 'Hansel and Gretel' trail of sweets from a smashed-up corner shop, a court heard.

The 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is said to have taken handfuls of goods from the store which was broken into just before midnight on August 9.

Gregor McKinley, prosecuting, said two teenagers, including the youth, were arrested a short distance from the food and wine store in Beckton, east London.

Mr McKinley said there was a 'trail of small confectionary items between the two men and the shop', just like the Brothers Grimm fairytale.

'Police also found a TV-DVD combination machine close to where they were detained,' the prosecutor told Inner London Crown Court.

The boy, who denies burglary, will stand trial before Newham Youth Court on October 4.

An application for bail was refused by Judge Roger Chapple.

The Crown Prosecution Service issued new guidance urging prosecutors to try and persuade judges to identify youth defendants in more serious cases.

Home Secretary Theresa May has also urged the courts to name youth defendants named in disturbances, where possible.

The names of children on trial aged between 10 and 17 cannot be revealed unless an order is lifted.

It is usually only in the most high-profile cases - such as the killing of two-year-old James Bulger - that child defendants are named.

Matt Dodson, prosecuting, told the court that Melfah had posted messages
about arranging a riot in Worcester city centre.

He was detained by 
police outside a branch of McDonalds with a group of youths on the night
of August 9.

'He was arrested outside McDonalds,' said Mr Dodson. 'It cannot be clear as to what exactly he was doing there on that night.'

Danny Cook, 21, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, also appeared before a court yesterday accused of founding the Facebook group.

On the page information Cook allegedly posted: 'I started the group for people who want to riot but are sat at home.

'I wanted to start a riot in Worcester, like many young people in Birmingham have, free iPads available.'

He also apparently wrote: 'There's 
loads of people who just want to get involved, that is why I started 
this group, LMAO.'

The group had 44 members by August 9.

Cook is charged with intentionally encouraging or assisting 
the commission of widespread thefts and criminal damage via the social 
networking site during the recent riots.

He was also bailed and will appear before Worcester Magistrates' Court on October 8.

Accused: Hollie Bentley, 19, allegedly told people to riot in Wakefield

In a separate incident, another teenager appeared in court accused of trying to incite a riot on Facebook.

Hollie Bentley, 19, is alleged to have created an event on the popular site entitled ‘Wakey Riots’, which invited people to meet in the centre of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on August 13 and 14, the court heard.

It is alleged that the event, created on August 9, also contained the phrase “Who’s up for it?”

Richard Ogden, prosecuting at Wakefield Magistrates Court, said that the event was posted to 700 people.

The teen, who spoke only to confirm her age and date of birth during the five-minute hearing, gave no indication of her plea to the charge of encouraging violent disorder.

She will appear at the same court on September 21 where the case is expected to be committed to Crown Court.

A £3million fund was launched today to help businesses hit by rioting and looting.

A coalition of businesses, supported by London mayor Boris Johnson, announced a High Street Fund offering cash support to smaller firms hit by the disturbances.

Firms including Barclays, BP, Lloyds Banking Group, Deloitte, RBS, Capita and Santander will contribute to the fund, with half a million pounds put in by the mayor.

Sir William Castell, chairman of the High Street Fund and chairman of the Wellcome Trust said: 'This fund is about providing real help to businesses who need help now.

'Everyone was shocked at the damage caused by the riots, and for numerous small businesses the hardship is still being felt.'

The London Mayor said: 'I have seen at first hand businesses showing remarkable resilience and true fighting spirit.

'However, it is no secret that many high streets in the capital are still suffering as a result of the appalling events earlier this month.

'Small businesses need urgent help to repair damage and get goods back on the shelves and the High Street Fund will help to do just that.

'I have absolutely no doubt that if we pull together and give our support to the fund, we can ensure that London emerges as a stronger and even more prosperous city than before.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
