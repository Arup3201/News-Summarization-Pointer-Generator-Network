British No 1 defeats Austrian 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 in Rome Masters third round

Murray now into quarter-finals where he will face Rafael Nadal for the first time since October 2011

One thing you can safely assume when Andy Murray renews acquaintance with Rafael Nadal is that there will be no repeat of the last two sets they played.

Strangely, that was more than two and a half years ago when the now Wimbledon champion blew him away 6-2, 6-0 in the last two sets of the Japan Open final. This will be on clay in the Italian Open quarter final, something very different.

It is the Big Four rivalry that has ground to a standstill after three Grand Slams in 2011 that saw them meet in the semi-finals, with the Spaniard emerging victorious on each occasion.

For a time 
on Thursday it seemed that it would be Nadal who might stand Murray up 
on this particular date, as he trailed Mikhail Youznhy by a set and a 
break before roaring back to win 6-7, 6-2, 6-1.

The
 Scot, playing on his 27th birthday, had earlier kept his side of the 
bargain with a 7-6, 6-4 victory over Austria’s Jurgen Melzer in a 
further sign that he might be coming to the boil, albeit slowly, ahead 
of the French Open and Wimbledon.

We
 will find out more on Friday and not just about Murray. By his 
extraordinary standards on clay Nadal has been struggling, and again 
relied on his remarkable fighting powers to overcome the Russian, just 
as he had against France’s Gilles Simon on Wednesday night.

Murray
 agreed that it was curious the two – who of the old ‘Big Four’ are 
probably the closest combination in terms of friendship – had been kept 
apart, mainly by injuries and luck of the draw.

'I
 haven't practised with him hardly at all, either,' said Murray. 'I will
 actually be quite interested to play against him, to kind of see how is
 game has changed and also the things I can do to make it difficult for 
him, and there will be things that won't work against him, that `I'll 
need to change as well. So it might be better for me to play against him
 now rather than in the French or at Wimbledon.'

Getting into gear: Murray cruised home after a troublesome first set

Blown it: Melzer faded after running Murray all the way in the first set

He
 does not see huge signs of deterioration related to unexpected exits in
 Monte Carlo and Barcelona over recent weeks: 'No, I think the thing is 
the confidence. For example his forehand looks similar to me but it 
looked like he was returning pretty short this week and when he is 
confident he tends to return a lot deeper.

'He
 has made some changes to his backhand during his career, so that might 
be the shot that breaks down a little more but I don’t see major changes
 in his game. Maybe he isn’t playing his best tennis at times, but he 
looked pretty damn good last week.

'When
 I was training for three or four weeks, some days the drills and 
patterns of play were specific for Djokovic or Federer, and we would 
also bring in some left handers, even if they play different to Rafa. I 
could still work on the patterns of play that Ivan and myself felt would
 work against him. The thing that is different about Rafa is the spin he
 generates on his forehand, you can see the stats the amount of rotation
 he puts on the ball is pretty incredible.

Tough test: Murray will now face world No 1 Rafael Nadal in the last eight in Rome

In the past: Murray and Nadal (right) last played each other in the Japan Open final in October 2011

'That’s
 the thing that takes time to get used to. The rest of his game is great
 but he doesn’t serve like Ivanisevic, he doesn’t return like Agassi, 
you always have an opportunity to dictate at some point against him.'

Nadal
 is also looking forward to the test: 'I have to go on the court and be 
aggressive, and I need to play with a little bit more control. It will 
be tough. It’s an important match for me because it’s against one of the
 best players in the world after two tough days.

'I will need to take my chances. If I don’t I will be spending the weekend in Mallorca.'

Murray
 served well against Melzer and will look to replicate that and make his
 opponent do plenty of running. An unlikely win would really park his 
tank on Rafa’s lawn or, to be more accurate, his favourite rectangle of 
dirt.
