Andy Coulson will pay a ‘higher price’ for his phone hacking conviction because of his position in David Cameron’s inner circle, a court heard yesterday.

The Prime Minister’s former director of communications had become a ‘lightning conductor’ for party political battles and media vendettas since he was found guilty of hacking, his lawyer said.

Coulson, 46, the former editor of the News of the World, faces a maximum two-year jail sentence after he was found guilty of presiding over a five-year phone hacking plot at the tabloid.

But in addition, his barrister Timothy Langdale QC said he had already lost two careers – one in journalism and one in politics – over the scandal and said hacking had become the father-of-three’s ‘nemesis’.

Coulson, three former news editors and private detective Glenn Mulcaire will face sentencing on Friday over prosecution claims they corrupted the 168-year-old newspaper and transformed it into a ‘thoroughly criminal enterprise’.

Mr Langdale said it was an unfair description of the now defunct newspaper and its journalists, and defended its part in British public life.

The lawyer praised the ‘genuine social and public impact’ of the Sunday tabloid’s investigations and campaigns and told the Old Bailey: ‘Mr Coulson was the editor of the News of the World when a considerable amount of phone hacking took place but there were many undiluted positives in the paper he edited.

‘Whilst it’s not currently fashionable to remember that, it is important that it is not forgotten.’

Coulson was editor of the News of the World from 2003 to 2007 after taking over from Rebekah Brooks, who was last week acquitted of all the charges against her.

He went on to become the Conservative Party’s director of communications and moved into Downing Street when Mr Cameron became Prime Minister.

In mitigation arguments on his behalf, Mr Langdale said: ‘Because of his role after he left the News of the World and because of the wider background to the phone hacking investigation, Mr Coulson has become something of a lightning conductor for the political aspects of the investigation.

‘The political and media furore in the 24 hours following verdicts demonstrated that vividly. Agendas are being pursued and will continue to be pursued way beyond this court’s remit.

‘The court endeavoured to keep party politics and media vendettas out of the trial, but these features mean he will pay a  higher price than most as a result of this conviction.’

Coulson was convicted of phone hacking last week but will also face a retrial after the jury failed to reach verdicts on two further charges that he sanctioned corrupt payments to police.

Mr Langdale said Coulson had not known phone hacking was illegal, although he had realised it was an invasion of privacy and a breach of the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct.

Journalist Matthew d’Ancona, a political commentator, was called as a witness on his behalf and said Coulson had been ‘utterly reliable’ as the Conservatives’ director of communications and had quickly become part of Mr Cameron’s ‘inner circle’.

He had wanted to restore trust in his role which ‘had been tarnished over the years by the culture of spin’, the London Evening Standard and Sunday Telegraph columnist said.

Mr Langdale told the Old Bailey Coulson was ‘a thoroughly decent man’ who could still contribute to society and urged the judge not to impose the maximum two-year jail sentence.

He will face sentencing on Friday, alongside private detective Glenn Mulcaire, 43, and former news editors Greg Miskiw, 64, Neville Thurlbeck, 52, and James Weatherup, 58.

The court heard one of the defendants acquitted by the jury, Mrs Brooks’ former assistant Cheryl Carter, wanted to apply to the court for the legal costs of her defence to be refunded.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC warned that if similar applications were made by the other acquitted defendants, including Mrs Brooks, it could cost millions in taxpayers’ money. No decision has yet been made.
