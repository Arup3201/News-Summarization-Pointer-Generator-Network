Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has insisted the New York Times public editor is ‘completely correct’ to question whether he is fit to be her new boss following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Mr Thompson, who will start as the newspaper’s chief executive next month on an estimated £3million a year with bonuses, spoke out after Margaret Sullivan questioned his integrity and ability in the wake of outrage against the corporation.

But apparent contradictions in his account of what he knew about Savile's abuse while he ran the corporation have emerged today.

Thompson - who left his BBC post last month - said in an interview with The Times today he had 'formed the impression' last year that Newsnight was probing widespread sexual abuse by the DJ.

But ten days ago in the New York Times he claimed he 'never heard any allegations' about Savile when director general.

In today's revelations the 55-year-old admitted he first heard about the probe from BBC foreign correspondent Caroline Hawley last Christmas, who told him: ‘You must be really concerned about Newsnight's investigation into Jimmy Savile. Is there in issue about an investigation on Newsnight about child abuse?'

Mr Thompson, who is set to start his new 
job on November 12, then spoke to an unnamed senior executive at the corporation before approaching BBC head of news Helen Boaden who then 
told him he should not be concerned by Newsnight's investigation into 
Savile and that it was dropped for journalistic reasons.

'By this stage I think it is clear to me that it's allegations which relate to sexual abuse of some kind,' he told The Times.

'So, at this point, I think I have formed the impression and I'm aware that they have been looking at allegations of abuse of some kind related to Jimmy Savile. But crucially I'm told that the normal editorial process has taken place and Newsnight has decided not to proceed with the investigation.'

After the interview Thompson's spokesman Ed Williams spoke to the paper about the apparent contradiction.

Mr Williams claimed Thompson had been 'speculating' nearly a year on about a general impression he may have formed at the time.

Talking about scrutiny from his future employer, he told the Guardian it
was ‘totally reasonable for institutions like the New York Times and 
the BBC to be free to examine everything, including subjects of 
corporate interest in the institution itself’.

Mr Thompson also said he was unaware if the allegations were sexual at the time, but was concerned by the limited details he received from the reporter and promptly tried to find out more.

However, he said that after speaking to Miss Boaden, he didn’t need to take any further action as he believed her - and, regardless, ‘nobody said there was an allegation of sex abuse on BBC premises’.

At conference: In a blog post on Tuesday, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself, said: 'How likely is it that (Thompson) knew nothing?'

Mr Thompson said that he would have 
done something if those allegations had been raised. Then he missed 
press cuttings in January and February that referred to the Newsnight 
probe being axed.

'I don't think there is anything in the account I have set out and what I did which would in any way affect my ability to discharge my duties as chief executive and president of the New York Times company,' he said.

'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly'

His comments came after Mrs Sullivan 
questioned the man who was BBC director general when the report that 
would have exposed Savile as a predator who targeted young, vulnerable 
girls, was cancelled.

In a blog post on Tuesday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself, said: 'How likely is it that (Thompson) knew nothing?

'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly.  It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.'

Scandal has engulfed the BBC after an 
ITV documentary accused Savile of being a paedophile who had abused 
hundreds of young victims in hospitals, schools and even on the 
corporation's premises.

But 
even as the documentary went out, it emerged that Newsnight had carried 
out its own investigation - including an interview with the same victim -
nearly a year before.

A 
team spent six weeks probing allegations that the presenter abused 
pupils at a school in Surrey, speaking to at least four women who 
claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events.

The
report was shelved at the last minute at the request of the programme's
editor Peter Rippon. It was not until this week that the BBC aired its 
own investigation into the scandal, on Panorama.

It covered both Savile's crimes and 
the Corporation's reaction. Mr Rippon stood aside from his role at 
Newsnight after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story was 
'inaccurate or incomplete'.

Earlier this week new BBC director general George Entwistle was grilled by MPs in parliament. He denied that the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women. 

The BBC has now launched two inquiries into the affair. One will address Savile's actions and how he went undetected during his career. A second will examine why the Newsnight report was pulled.

Meanwhile pressure grew on his predecessor Mr Thompson, who left his £622,000 post at the BBC earlier this year. One Wall Street analyst called for the paper to delay him taking over the company.

'It seems to me he will have to attend a hearing in the UK parliament,' Evercore Partners analyst Doug Arthur said. 'That is going to be a distraction. It's unfortunate. It's an unexpected complication.'

Public Editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in her blog:

'How
likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media 
company is something like a newspaper’s publisher... publishers usually 
don’t know about editorial decisions — unless they are very big ones, 
fraught with legal implications.

'His integrity and 
decision-making are bound to affect The Times and its journalism — 
profoundly. It’s worth considering now whether he is the right person 
for the job, given this turn of events.

'The Times might start by
publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what 
exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC.

'What
are the implications of these problems for him as incoming Times chief 
executive? What are the implications for the Times Company to have its 
new C.E.O. – who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here –
arriving with so much unwanted baggage?'

Mrs Sullivan declined to comment further on her blog as did the New York Times.

As public editor and a representative of readers, she writes about issues affecting the newspaper independent from New York Times management, including chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor Jill Abramson.

Since stepping into the role in September, Mrs Sullivan has already made waves including a post that criticised the paper's decision not to publish on the front page a story about a congressional hearing into attacks on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last month in which four Americans were killed.
