Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times Formula One World Champion Michael, looks set to carry on his father's legacy after he secured a podium finish in this season's German junior kart championships.

The 15-year-old, who finished runner-up at the world championships in France last month, lost his lead in Sunday's final round of races in Genk, Belgium to come in second place - finishing behind main rival David Beckmann.

The teenager, who has promised this is 'only the beginning' of his career in the sport, has also one the European title this season.

His success on the karting track  comes as his 45-year-old father continues to recover from a major head injury after six months in a coma following a skiing accident in December in the French Alps.

Having raced under the surname of Betsch, his mother Corinna's maiden name, Mick Schumacher adopted the name Mick Jnr this season.

Last month he spoke of his intention to pursue a career in the sport, saying that it was 'only the beginning'. 

Speaking after he was crowned World Karting Vice Champion, Mick said: 'Of course I am proud of such an important result. But it is also clear that it is my goal to be world champion. This is only the beginning of my career.' 

The 15-year-old continues to race karts, which offer little protection to the driver, as his father receives treatment for his skiing injury at his Switzerland home.  

Michael Schumacher had a similar start to his legendary racing career - starting to race at a young age after his father built him his first kart when he was just four years old.

In 1983, at the age of 14, Michael Schumacher became eligible to hold a German karting licence. And the following year - at the age of 15 - the racing legend won the title of German Kart Champion.

His father went on to break numerous records on his way to claiming seven world titles and staking his claim among the sport's most successful drivers.

The German won back-to-back titles with Benetton in the mid-nineties before remarkably winning five successive championships with Ferrari at the turn of the century.

The family has been rocked by Schumacher's accident last December, which left the F1 legend in a coma for months before he was moved back to his Switzerland home on the shores of Lake Geneva for further rehabilitation.

Updates on his condition have been few and far between, and upon being moved back home earlier this month from a clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said there was a 'long and difficult' road ahead.

Kelm said: 'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months.

'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. We would like extend our gratitude to the entire team at CHUV Lausanne for their thorough and competent work.

'We ask that the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculations about his state of health are avoided.'

His family, including Mick, have largely maintained a dignified silence on the subject.
