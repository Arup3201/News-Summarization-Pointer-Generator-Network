In the line of duty: Ivan Marcano, an off-duty NYPD officer, was shot in the chest Wednesday while trying to break up a robbery

An off-duty NYPD officer managed to chase a robbery suspect with a bullet in his chest, after the alleged thief shot him, police said.

Ivan Marcano, 27, who was driving near Bronx Community College with his girlfriend yesterday evening, spotted two men apparently robbing another man, police said.

After getting out of his car and showing his credentials, Mr Marcano was shot in the chest.

Despite sustaining injury, he managed to follow one of the suspects, eventually shooting him dead.

Security video obtained by the New York Post shows Mr Marcano emerging from his car yesterday evening around Harrison Avenue in the Bronx. It was then, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, that the officer was shot in the chest.

Video shows the two alleged robbers speeding off in a white Mustang, riding with a third person.

Meanwhile, Mr Marcano managed to climb back into the car with his girlfriend behind the wheel.

They were intending to drive to the hospital, Mr Kelly said.

Weapon of choice: This is the gun used to allegedly shoot the off-duty NYPD officer

However, as they were driving, they again encountered the men, who had crashed into a livery cab and were attempting to escape on foot.

While applying pressure to his own chest injury, Mr Marcano got out of his own vehicle and fired two shots, killing one of the suspects, according to the Post.

The New York Times reported that a .380-caliber semiautomatic weapon was recovered from the scene of the shooting.

Mr Marcano was taken to the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Wednesday night, where he remains in stable condition. Officials said the gun narrowly missed his heart.

Task force: NYPD officers in the Morris Heights neighbourhood patrolled last night following the shooting

Following the shootings, swarms of NYPD officers dressed in riot gear patrolled the Bronx neighbourhood looking for the two remaining suspects. 

Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is outspoken on gun violence, said following the incident: ‘This is another case of guns in the wrong hands ending in violence.’

He continued: ‘(Marcano) is the 12th NYPD officer who has been shot this year and the second police officer we’ve seen shot this week.’

The other shooting to which Mr Bloomberg referred was an NYPD officer who was fatally shot in Queens.
