The Royal Navy's sailors will be waiting a little longer to don their bold new 'fashion statement' uniforms - complete with American-style baseball caps - after the first batch arrived mouldy.

The new uniforms, first tested back in 2012, were supposed to begin being rolled out this month, but the first order for 1,700 'Combat Number 4 Dress' were unwearable.

It is thought the uniforms had been steam cleaned, but not dried properly.  

The new uniform is designed to be 'easy-to-wear', with Velcro replacing buttons, zip-up boots instead of laces - and an American-style baseball cap

A Navy source told The Sun: 'There were plans to roll it out from the start of January. The first batch was completely ruined and unusable. It's all rather embarrassing really and an unwanted delay.'

The uniform replaces the Navy’s traditional lighter blue outfit and is the first new uniform to be worn by our sailors on operations for more than 20 years.

The new kit, which is being manufactured by a British company as part of a £250,000 deal, is designed to be more versatile and adaptable to the different weather that the Navy encounters as it carries out its worldwide operations. 

But when the uniforms were unveiled two years ago, traditionalists were horrified to see Royal Navy sailors would soon be wearing American-style baseball caps on operations.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said at the time the caps were 'cool and more modern'.

The new uniforms also replaced buttons with Velcro, and zip-up boots with fake laces. 

But when the order for 1,700 uniforms arrived, they were unwearable. It is thought they had been steam cleaned but not dried properly before being packaged

The MoD went as far as to say the uniforms were a 'Daring fashion statement' - a play on words based around HMS Daring, the £1billion Type 45 destroyer where Combat Number 4 Dress was trialed.

All 190 officers and crew were wearing the new uniform, with even the warship's commander Captain Gary Robinson opting to wear the baseball cap on the bridge during counter-piracy operations in the Arabian Gulf.

Formal uniforms will continue to be worn, however, at official dinners and ceremonial occasions.

However, this set back in the planned roll out is only a temporary, with a Royal Navy spokesman saying it was still full steam ahead. 

The spokesman said: 'We continue to work closely with our supplier in delivering this improved uniform, the majority of seagoing and operational units will be wearing the improved uniform by the end of July 2015.'
