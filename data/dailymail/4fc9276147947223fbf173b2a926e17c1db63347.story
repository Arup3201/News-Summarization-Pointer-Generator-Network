A man has been arrested after he allegedly lit his girlfriend's cat on fire and beheaded it with scissors to 'prove a point' before biting off part of the woman's ear during an argument. 

Michael Trudeau from Chaska, Minnesota, has also been accused of trying to shove an umbrella down the 42-year-old victim's throat while threatening to kill her.

The 51-year-old was arrested last Sunday after the woman managed to escape and call 911. Officers arrived and saw her in the building's lobby shaken and covered in blood.

Shocking: Michael Trudeau, 51 from Chaska, Minnesota, has been charged with many felonies after he allegedly bit part of his girlfriend's ear off and shoved an umbrealla down her throat after burning and decapitating her cat

The first responders then found Trudeau 'agitated and angry' and looking for a weapon. They then tased him after he 'refused to obey comments' and asked to be shot.

The alleged victim told authorities Trudeau had traveled to her apartment after drinking vodka throughout the day.

According to Fox 9 they began arguing about their relationship. She claims it escalated to the point where Trudeau put was in a headlock.

He is believed to have choked her until she passed out before trying to push the umbrella into her mouth.

She managed to get away and bit his finger in self-defense, but he responded by biting off part of her ear.  

Violence: The 42-year-old alleged victim said the terrifying incident unfolded after Tridueau visited the Cedar Creek Apartments after a day of drinking. They got in a row and then he threatened to kill her 

Later, the woman told officers that three weeks earlier, Trudeau lit her cat on fire in the middle of her living room to prove a point.

When the flames were extinguished, he then choked it to death before decapitating it.   

'When the cat was extinguished, [Trudeau] choked the cat with both hands until it died,' the complaint says. 'After the cat was dead, the defendant went into the kitchen and used a pair of kitchen scissors to dismember the cat by cutting its head off of its body.'

Trudeau has been charged with first-degree assault, terroristic threats and mistreatment of animals. 

He remains in custody and won't be released unless he puts up $1 million cash or a $10 million bond.

Trudeau's criminal record contains a 2006 conviction for animal cruelty and a prior for domestic assault by strangulation.
