HSBC has been accused of racism after it closed down accounts held by high profile Muslim groups including two charities and a mosque.

The Cordoba Foundation and Ummah Welfare Trust (UWT), along with the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, were sent letters, some without explanation, informing them the high street bank would stop offering them their services.

Despite insisting that the account closures were 'absolutely not based on race or religion', the multi-national corporation has been condemned for allegedly singling out Muslims and prominent figures have called for a boycott.

Controversial: HSBC has told a number of high profile Muslim organisations, including the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, that it will be closing down their accounts 

Activist Anas Altikriti, the chief executive of the Cordoba Foundation, said that he met a 'wall of silence' after he was told the account he held with his wife and two sons for 30 years would be shut down.

The 45 year old, who was born in Baghdad and came to Britain as a young child, said he opened an account with the Midland Bank - now part of HSBC - as a teenager with just a £10 note.

He said he was angered by the failure of the bank to give an explanation for its action.

'I am angered because of the wall of silence and the tone of the letter. It is difficult to take as I regard myself as a law abiding citizen who tries to make things better in conflicts around the world and tries to promote peace and dialogue,' he said.

He flew to Baghdad in late 2005 to secure the release of British peace campaigner Norman Kember, who was being held hostage in the country. Mr Kember, along with two Canadians held hostage, were eventually released in 2006 after 117 days in captivity as the result of a British-led military operation. 

He added: 'When you are left with no explanation, you are left to speculate, from the whole context of the other organisations that have been targeted, I would speculate that it is because of my activism either for Gaza or for the Palestinians. 

'I have also been vocal in my attacks on the governments of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates regarding their stand on the military coup in Egypt.'

Allegations: The bank have said the decisions are 'absolutely not based on race or religious grounds' 

Last week, the north London-based Finsbury Park Mosque, once run by hate preacher Abu Hamza, was notified of the decision to close their account on September 22.

Trustee Khalid Oumar said: 'The letters that have been sent and the letters that we received do not give any reason why the accounts were closed in the first place.

'That has led us to believe that the only reason this has happened is because of an Islamophobic campaign targeting Muslim charities in the UK.'

Chairman Mohammed Kozbar added: 'The bank didn’t even contact us beforehand. Didn’t give us a chance even to address their concerns.

'For us it is astonishing - we are a charity operating in the UK, all our operations are here in the UK and we don’t transfer any money out of the UK. All our operations are funded from funds within the UK.'   

Local MP Jeremy Corbyn also opposed HSBC's move, saying he reckons the mosque has turned over a new leaf after now-convicted terrorist Hamza was removed.  

Meanwhile, the UWT was told its account will be closed after two months in a letter from the bank dated July 22, in which HSBC said: 'Provision of banking services to Ummah Welfare Trust now falls outside of our risk appetite.'

Registered with the Charity Commission as the Amanat Charity Trust, UWT provides emergency relief such as food and medical supplies to conflict zones, including Syria and Gaza.

It is not the first time it has had its bank accounts shut down - Barclays did the same during the conflict in Gaza in 2008.

A statement on the Bolton-based charity’s website said: 'As the attacks intensify in Gaza and innocent people continue to be killed, HSBC Bank has issued a two-month notice to Ummah Welfare Trust to close down its accounts.

Condemnation: The bank was also criticised on Twitter, with one user accusing them of discrimination

Frustrated: Another user said she would take action of her own following the allegations

Opposition: Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad, a trustree from the Ummah Welfare Trust, has called for its supporters to join a campaign to boycott HSBC

'This is similar to what Barclays did to Ummah Welfare Trust during the previous Gaza war in 2008. A notice then was also served for the charity to close its accounts.

'Ummah Welfare Trust reassures supporters that, in response, the charity will increase its support to the orphans, widows and injured civilians in Gaza through its other bank accounts.'

Trustee Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad, in a video statement on the site, also called on its supporters to join in a 'campaign to boycott HSBC'.

The bank was also criticised on Twitter. Nav Abbasi said: 'HSBC is a racist organisation discriminating against people.

Another user, writing under the name Misteclatmer, added: 'HSBC are a bunch of racists'.

Some HSBC customers have even decided to voluntarily close their accounts in protest at the controversial new policy.

Sarah Chowdhury said: 'No need for a letter, HSBC. I’ll close my account myself.' 

An HSBC spokesman said: 'We do not discuss relationships we may or may not have with a customer, nor confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer. In general terms, decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly, but are absolutely not based on the race or religion of a customer.

'Discrimination against customers on grounds of race or religion is immoral, unacceptable and illegal, and HSBC has comprehensive rules and policies in place to ensure race or religion are never factors in the decisions we make.'
