Carl Mills, 28, denies murdering three members of the same family

A man accused of murdering a family of three in an arson attack on their home has repeatedly denied starting the lethal blaze.

Carl Mills, 28, is accused of starting a fire which ripped through a property in Cwmbran, South Wales, killing his teenage partner and their baby.

Grandmother Kim Buckley, 46, her daughter Kayleigh, 17, and six-month-old granddaughter Kimberley all died in the violent blaze in September last year.

Mills, who was living in a tent in the house's front garden at the time, sent a series of threatening text messages before the fire.

Among them was a warning: 'I will burn your house down.'

Mills, on trial at Newport Crown Court, denies all three murders. He entered the witness box today to give evidence in his own defence.

The jury has heard that he met Kayleigh through Facebook in August 2010, when she was 15, and later moved from Manchester to Cwmbran to be with her.

The prosecution have accused Mills of grooming an immature schoolgirl, who was 'infatuated with him, for sex.

He claims that they were engaged, planned to get married and have a family and were in love.

Patrick Harrington QC, defending, asked him about 'nasty texts' that he sent to his teenage partner on the night she died.

Mills had said he was 'paranoid' and drunk and believed that she was seeing someone else when he sent them.

He said that the tone of the text was
 'nasty' and he made threats about the burning the house down, but 
denied actually doing it.

Gregory Bull QC, prosecuting, asked Mills about his relationship with Kayleigh.

Previously the jury heard that Mills, living on £180 benefits a fortnight, initially travelled by bus and train from Manchester to visit her.

She would later skip school to be with 
him and eventually moved into a tent with him when he was living in the 
front garden of her home.

He told the court he knew she was still a schoolgirl.

Mills went on to agree, under questioning, that he kept the relationship from Kayleigh's mother for seven months.

Mills said that when was living rough on the streets of Cwmbran, he did not turn Kayleigh away, and she 'kept following him'.

He also denied being only interested in havign sex with the teenager.

Mills claimed that he was unaware that he was Kayleigh's first boyfriend.

The trial continues.
