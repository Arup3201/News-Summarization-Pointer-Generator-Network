High profile allegations of abuse by Jimmy Savile and other celebrities have triggered a 20 per cent surge in sex assaults reported to police.

New figures released today show police were told of 64,200 sexual offences in the year to March, with officials crediting the publicity around historic allegations for encouraging victims to come forward.

It also emerged police are failing to solve half of crimes, including nearly three quarters of cases of theft, criminal damage and arson.

Official data from police forces show they recorded 3.7million offences last year, unchanged on the year before.

However the number of sexual offences has soared. The number of rapes increased by 27 per cent compared with the previous year and is now at the highest level since records began in 2002-03.

The number of other sexual offences increased by 17 per cent. Offences involving obscene publications and protected sexual increased by 31 per cent.

The Office for National Statistics said the increases were likely to be linked to the effect of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse.

The number of rapes and sexual assaults against girls under the age of 13 increased 21 per cent, and offences where boys under 13 were the alleged victims rose 35 per cent.

The number of ‘Sexual activity involving a child under 13’ offences increased by 33 per cent compared with the previous year, from 2,176 to 2,887

Mark Bangs, from the Office for National Statistics, said: 'Part of the rise in sexual offences is related to the effect of the Operation Yewtree investigation which has brought to light a large number of historic sexual offences.

'The increase is also likely to reflect a broader Yewtree effect whereby more victims are coming forward to report sexual offences to the police.'

Publicity surrounding allegations of abuse against Jimmy Savile has encouraged other victims to come forward

The NSPCC has said that media coverage of the crimes of Savile and others were a key reason as to why victims had felt able to come forward and report their abuse to the police.

Of the 30,738 sexual offences, 3,328 - more than 10 per cent - were said to date back more than 20 years.

Separate data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales – which records all crimes based on interviews with the public and not just those reported to the police – showed a marked drop in offences.

It estimated that there were 7.3 million crimes in 2013/14, down 14 per cent on the previous year and the lowest since 1981 when records began.

However, data from 28 police forces in England and Wales, excluding the Metropolitan Police, showed that in April and May this year 52 per cent of crimes were classed as 'investigation complete, no suspect identified', meaning that the case is closed unless new evidence comes to light.

This happened in 73 per cent of criminal damage and arson cases, 72 per cent of theft and 56 per cent of robbery, according to figures released by the Home Office, which stressed that the investigations could be reopened later.

The survey showed that there were 1.3 million violent incidents, a drop of 20 per cent on the previous year. This is the equivalent of two in 100 adults being victims in 2013/14, compared to five in 100 in 1995.

However, according to police figures, violence rose 6 per cent, by around 33,000 offences, although the number of recorded homicides was 537 - down by 21 from the previous year and its lowest since 1978.

Deaths by dangerous driving rose sharply to 282, up from 174 the previous year, and police figures also revealed a 20 per cent rise in sex offences.

Among all the 43 forces, 36 had seen a rise in shoplifting, including 18 per cent in Merseyside and 17 per cent in Humberside.

Fraud was also up by 17 per cent according to police figures, and analysis showed that 5.1 per cent of bank or credit card users were victims of card fraud, up from 4.6 per cent the previous year.

Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of Victim Support, said: 'It is alarming that so many serious crimes remain unsolved. Victims want to know that the police are doing all they can to investigate the crime committed against them.

'Investigating a crime is a matter for police, who also have a duty to keep victims informed and explain decisions made about an investigation. This obligation is set out in the Government's Victims Code.'
