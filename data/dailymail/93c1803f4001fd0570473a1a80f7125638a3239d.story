Mourners have gathered to pay their respects to one of Hollywood’s greatest hell-raisers.

Friends and family of Peter O'Toole - including his ex-wife Sian Phillips - turned out at a church in north London yesterday.

They bid farewell to the legendary actor - with his daughters Kate and Patricia even waltzing down the aisle.

O'Toole - best known for his starring role in Sir David Lean's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia - died aged 81 last week.

The veteran actor passed away on Saturday at the Wellington hospital in London after battling a long illness.

His funeral was held at Golders Green crematorium in Hampstead yesterday.

Miss Philips - who had two daughters with O'Toole - had promised to attend the service despite her turbulent 20-year marriage with the star.

During the funeral, one of the couple's daughters, Kate, told mourners: ‘The world has lost a great actor but I’m not concerned with that.

'I
 simply have lost a great dad and the best friend I ever had. Daddy made
 me laugh more than anyone else I have ever met in my life. 

'He was always there for me in times of crisis and frequently danced with me in times of joy and celebration.’

She recalled how her father had celebrated the life of his own mother Constance by waltzing in the chapel at her funeral service.

Emotional service: Noel Coward's Someday I'll Find You was played at the end of the Hollywood legend's funeral

So, when Noel Coward’s Someday I’ll Find You was played at the end of the funeral, Kate, her sister Patricia and family friend Martin O’Mally decided to waltz down the aisle.

Other attendees at the service included O'Toole's former partner Karen Somerville and their son Lorcan.

O’Toole, 81, was
 nominated for an Academy Award eight times and in 2003 received an 
honorary Oscar for his outstanding contribution to film.

The reformed but unrepentant star - whose early life is something of a mystery - died just one year after he formally retired from acting on the eve of his 80th birthday.

Since his death, tributes have poured in from well-known figures - with Prime Minister David Cameron decsecribing O'Toole's performance in Lawrence Of Arabia as ‘stunning’.

Comedian David Walliams tweeted: ‘He was hugely entertaining. The greatest company. A legend on screen and off.'

Meanwhile, Stephen Fry wrote: ‘Oh what terrible 
news. Farewell Peter O’Toole. I had the honour of directing him in a 
scene. Monster, scholar, lover of life, genius ...’

And Irish President Michael D Higgins said Ireland and the world had lost ‘one of the giants of film and theatre’.

But Broadcaster Michael Parkinson said it 
was hard to be too sad about the news of his passing - adding: ‘Peter 
didn’t leave much of life unlived, did he?'

On Friday night, O’Toole’s body was laid out in an open coffin for friends and family to pay their respects.

The wake - which was held at the star's London home - attracted the likes of rock star Sting and the band Alabama 3.
