There has been a huge rise in the number of elderly people being locked in rooms, tied to chairs or otherwise restrained by nurses and carers, the NHS watchdog warns.

For some age groups, use of such measures has doubled over the past three years.

The Care Quality Commission is to carry out rigorous checks on how hospitals and care homes are using the techniques amid concerns staff are being too forceful.

Its figures show there were 157 restraint orders per 100,000 population aged 75 to 84 in 2012/13, up from 71 per 100,000 in 2009/10.

Another 265 orders were granted per 100,000 of the population aged 85 and over last year, compared with 129 per 100,000 three years ago.

But these do not include the number of times staff restrained patients without seeking permission.

The forceful measures – called deprivation of liberty safeguards, or DoLS – were introduced in 2009.

Hospital staff must apply to their local NHS trust before using them,  while care home workers make an application to the council.

Approvals can be granted quickly – in less than 24 hours – and campaigners say there is no excuse for not obeying the law.

Common practices include putting patients in beds with high railings so they cannot fall out, leaving walking sticks or frames out of reach or strapping them in chairs with lap-belts.

The CQC is concerned too many carers are restraining patients before seeking approval and possibly hurting or upsetting them. It is also worried that councils and NHS trusts are granting them too easily.

In one instance, an elderly man with dementia was kept against his will at a care home after staff had sought permission from the council, the Care Quality Comission said.

They refused to take him to the local working men’s club five minutes away and he became so miserable he tried to escape.

Two-thirds of hospitals and care homes fail to inform the watchdog when they have applied to restrain patients – and whether it was approved or turned down. The watchdog wants to check staff who were turned down did not do it regardless.

CQC chief executive David Behan said: ‘We expect more focus on reducing the restraint and restriction of vulnerable people lacking capacity.’

For all ages a total of 11,887 applications were made in 2012/13, up from 11,393 the previous year.

Last year a total 6,546 were granted, a rise from 6,339 in 2011/12 – and about half were for dementia sufferers.

George McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘These findings point to a worrying lack of awareness and understanding of the use of deprivation of liberty safeguards.’
