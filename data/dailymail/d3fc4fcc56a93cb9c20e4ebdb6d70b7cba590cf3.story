Atletico Madrid believe they can persuade Arsenal to part with Santi Cazorla this summer.

The Spain midfielder is a long-term target of Diego Simeone and the Argentine hopes this could be the year he lands the 29-year-old.

Cazorla has been an integral member of Arsene Wenger's plans since his arrival from Malaga two years ago.

On the move? Santi Cazorla is a summer transfer target for Atletico Madrid

But competition for attacking midfield positions is fierce at Arsenal, particularly after the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez.

In addition to the Chilean, Mesut Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott will all compete to play in positions behind the central striker next season.

And Atletico are hopeful that Wenger can be persuaded to part with Cazorla, despite the fact he only signed a 12-month contract extension earlier this year.

The Gunners will not let Cazorla leave cheaply, however, and would demand at least £15m for the diminutive star.

Atletico are also showing an interest in Gunners left back Nacho Monreal as a potential replacement for Filipe Luis, who has joined Chelsea.

Monreal joined the Gunners in January 2013 as a replacement for first-choice left back Kieran Gibbs.

But the Spaniard has failed to dislodge Gibbs and has spent much of his time at the club on the bench.

Monreal expressed concerns to Wenger over his lack of playing time last season, but his chances of increased playing time next term are unlikely to improve.
