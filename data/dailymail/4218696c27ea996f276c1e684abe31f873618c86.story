Most artists prefer to work using their hands.

But 42-year-old Chen Xiang prefers to create calligraphy works by inserting a paint brush into his eye socket.

The artist, from southeast China, inserts the blunt end of a brush underneath his eye lid before leaning over a canvas to paint. 

A bizarre clip has recently emerged of a Chinese man painting calligraphy with his eye socket

As the video begins, Mr Chen Xiang starts by fitting the paintbrush into his eye

As he puts the brush to paper, one almost forgets that the 42 year old is creating the art with only his eye

Mr Chen displays his unique skill at his art shop in Sichuan Province, where his will happily show how he creates the great swirling letters using his eye.

He says he began learning calligraphy at age eight and started practising 'eye-writing' 16 years ago. 

But viewers will need a strong stomach if they want to watch Mr Chen work.

While inserting the paint brush into his eye is somewhat uncomfortable to watch, the ensuing strokes made onto the canvas can be mesmerising.

Mr Chen Xiang showed off his unique skill at his art store in the Sichuan Province late last month

Mr Chen says he began learning calligraphy at age 8, but didn't start 'eye-writing' until he was 16

The finished product: It's hard to believe Chen Xiang's masterpiece was drawn using his eye socket
