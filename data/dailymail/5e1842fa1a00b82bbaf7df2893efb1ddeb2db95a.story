As well as scoring Manchester City's crucial second goal against Stoke on Wednesday night, James Milner also managed to earn a new record.

The energetic midfielder managed to cover more ground in a single game than any other player so far this season.

According to EA Sports Player Performance Index data, Milner ran a hugely impressive 13.56km as his side put Stoke to the sword with a 4-1 Premier League victory at the Britannia.

Christian Eriksen – TOTTENHAM vs Swansea – 13.17km

Harry Kane – TOTTENHAM vs Swansea – 13.12km

Marouane Fellaini – MAN UTD vs Southampton – 13.12km

The 29-year-old proved that hard work pays off with his 55th minute header, adding to his impressive tally of four goals in his past six games.

After a lung-busting performance on Wednesday night, Milner may now sit on top of distance stats tree, but a certain Burnley midfielder has managed to feature on four separate occasions in our top 10 list.

Scotland international George Boyd dominates the top five thanks to marathon performances against Aston Villa (13.24km), Manchester United (13.30km), Stoke (13.34km) and Newcastle where the 29-year-old covered a massive 13.55km during Burnley's 3-3 draw at St James' Park.

Harry Kane scored Tottenham first goal and managed to cover 13.12km during Tottenham 2-1 win against Swansea in December

The Premier League clash also saw Boyd grab his second goal in as many games to help the visitors grab a last gasp point. 

Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been hitting the headlines for his goal scoring exploits of late, but the 20-year-old striker is also managing to put in a huge shift for Mauricio Pochettino's side.

Kane's biggest distance so far this season came in the away victory against Swansea in December and the striker goes some way in proving goals can give a player an extra stride after heading Spurs into the lead inside the first five minutes.  

In the same game, Christian Eriksen managed a distance of 13.17km as Garry Monk's Swansea side suffered a 2-1 defeat.

Another big name to feature inside the top 10 include Marouane Fellaini for his impressive 13.12km covered during United's match against Southampton in December, 2014.
