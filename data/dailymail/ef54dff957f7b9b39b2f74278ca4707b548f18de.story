A drugs squad officer became hooked on heroin after posing as an addict for undercover operations.

Robert Carroll, 40,Â  who lives in Huddersfield, claimed he 'inhaled fumes' from the class A drug while pretending to be a junkie to trap dealers.

Manchester Crown Court heard how the lines between his real life and that of his undercover alter ego, 'Lee Taylor', became dangerously blurred as he began to smoke heroin every day.

Jailed: Greater Manchester Police drugs squad officer Robert Carroll has been jailed after becoming hooked on heroin

Pc Carroll has now been jailed for 14 months by a judge who heard that he gave his drug dealer police issue weapons, and sneaked away from work to meet him in a police car.

Carroll admitted charges of misconduct in public office and theft.

The former officer, who was sacked by the Chief Constable earlier this year, claims Greater Manchester Police failed him by not protecting him from the risk of addiction or supporting him through his problems.

GMP denies the claims.

Carroll joined GMP in 2001 and trained as a 'test purchase' officer in 2006.

By 2009 Carroll was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity Lifeline

In 2008, he joined the force's Sigma unit - which is dedicated to rooting out drug dealers using covert tactics.

Police have gone undercover as addicts in a number of crackdowns in recent years, most recently in Operation Cairo, which targeted street dealers in Cheetham Hill, Manchester.

Whilst working for the unit, he was commended for his work by his commanders and a judge.

But by 2009, Carroll was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity Lifeline.

He was prescribed Subutex and attempted to wean himself off the drug, but by 2012 he had lapsed.

In July of that year, a drug dealer's home was raided by police who found a GMP issue CS gas canister and a baton which had been issued to Carroll.

At the time, Carroll was working at Oldham police station on 'restricted duties' after time off with depression.

But twice in one morning he sneaked off his shift at the station to meet the dealer, raising bosses' suspicions.

A raid at Carroll's home days later recovered a phone which revealed he had contacted the dealer 2,200 times in the previous four months.

Carroll says he has now beaten his addiction

Carroll says he has now beaten his addiction - with the help of his police officer wife, who took charge of his money and booked hypnotherapy sessions.

When he was sacked by Sir Peter Fahy earlier this year, the Chief Constable described it as an 'enormous tragedy' for a 'very hardworking officer' and his family, the court heard.

In a statement Carroll said he 'simply needed help' - and got 'no support from the force'.

Before he was jailed, the former officer told the M.E.N. he was distraught at what he had put his family through, and accused GMP of 'forgoing the handling of their most valuable equipment - people'.

Jailing him, Judge Martin Steiger QC said: 'I fully recognise that the defendant became addicted through his police service and he's to be commended on the efforts he made in the interests of law and order.

'But where police officers suffer because of their duties it is incumbent upon them to obtain treatment and help.

'He did not do so - he did the very opposite - he continued his association with White.

'A significant sentence is called for to demonstrate the high standards the public expect from police.'

After the case GMP dismissed some of Carroll's claims.

Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: 'Whatever personal mitigation Carroll may have, it is not an excuse for such a wanton abuse of his position as a police officer.

'When someone becomes a police officer, they take an oath to protect the public and quite clearly, Carroll failed in that public duty.

'Carroll's drug addiction 
significantly clouded his judgement, so much so that he passed a 
prohibited weapon to a drug dealer in exchange for drugs.

'He
 also seriously neglected his duties as a police officer leaving the 
station while on duty and the force area so he could attempt to buy 
drugs from Jermaine White.

'That
 is not the sort of behaviour the public, or Greater Manchester Police, 
expects from a serving officer and as a result, not only has he now been
 convicted of a number of serious offences, but he has lost his 
reputation and the respect of his colleagues.

'Greater
 Manchester Police's Professional Standards Branch is here to protect 
the public. The branch has a crucial role to play in ensuring that 
officers and staff uphold the very highest standards of behaviour and 
when there is evidence of criminality or misconduct, we will take 
action.

'We must always remember that we police with the consent of the public, so I want to both warn officers and staff, and reassure our communities, that if we uncover any evidence of any GMP employees engaging in criminal activities or committing misconduct, that we will carry out a thorough investigation and regardless of rank or position, we will pursue these matters through the courts.'
