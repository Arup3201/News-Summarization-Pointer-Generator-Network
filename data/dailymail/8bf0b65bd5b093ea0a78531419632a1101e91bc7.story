Oldham Athletic could make a shock bid to have Paul Scholes as their new manager.

Current Latics supremo Lee Johnson is expected to be named boss of League One rivals Barnsley on Wednesday.

Sportsmail understands the 33-year-old is due to be unveiled at Oakwell  barring any last-minute hitches after a compensation package was agreed with Oldham.

And the play-off chasing Latics could now turn to the United legend, a boyhood fan who lives in the town, initially until the end of the season.

Whether Scholes, now a respected TV pundit and newspaper columnist, would be open to taking the job is unclear.

But Oldham chairman Simon Corney is a longstanding friend of the 40-year-old who has previously helped out and monitored training sessions at the club.

A source at Oldham said: 'It's certainly something that would capture the imagination and it is something that is being considered.'

Scholes, who was part of the ITV team at the Etihad Stadium for Manchester City's 2-1 Champions League defeat by Barcelona on Tuesday night, is also a co-owner of non-League Salford City along with a number of his Class of '92 team-mates.

Johnson, who was the league's youngest manager when he took over at Oldham, has won praise for the work he has done at Boundary Park.

In his first season he guided them away from relegation and in his second he performed an admirable rebuilding job after losing his top players.

Oldham currently lie in ninth position, two points outside the play-offs.

Scholes has often been spotted in the stands watching the Latics.

Following England's 1-0 win over Argentina at the 2002 World Cup the midfielder was asked by reporters who his favourite player was.

He gave the name of Frankie Bunn, the Oldham striker who scored six goals in a 1989 League Cup victory over Scarborough.

When asked to name another, Scholes replied: 'Andy Ritchie'.
