Ed Miliband will be forced to sack up to one in five of his frontbenchers if he becomes Prime Minister under rules to stop him wasting public money.

Shadow ministers are braced for a dramatic cull of those offered ’no-jobs’ in opposition to quell rebellion.

The bloodbath will occur even if Mr Miliband wins an overall majority. If he is forced into a coalition, even more Labour MPs will miss out on a ministerial salary.

Labour leader Ed Miliband will have to make difficult choices about which of his frontbenchers get paid ministerial jobs, and which are sent to the backbenches

Mr Miliband wants to use this weeks Labour conference in Manchester to show he is in touch with the concerns of normal voters with just eight months until the general election.

But privately several of those given frontbench jobs are braced for the chop.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also vowed to cut the pay of those who do become ministers by 5 per cent, under efforts to prove he can be trusted with the nation’s finances.

Mr Miliband is expected to carry out a reshuffle after the party conference season.

However, he is already breaking rules introduced 40 years ago to stop political leaders from packing their frontbenchers with MPs and Peers to increase the party's grip on discipline.

Labours own analysis shows it has 138 frontbenchers in the Commons and the Lords.

But under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act passed in 1975, only 109 ministerial salaries can be paid at any one time.

It raises the prospect of 29 people - or 21 per cent - who currently think they are heading for a job in government being left bitterly disappointed.

Prime Ministers are also banned from having more than 95 ministers in the House of Commons, to ensure those on the government payroll does not dominate Parliament.

At the Labour conference in Manchester today, Mr Miliband appeared on stage with senior Labour figures involved in the Scottish referendum campaign, including Jim Murphy, Alistair Darling, Johann Lamont and Douglas Alexander

However the most recent full list of Labour frontbenchers published shows as many as 105 MPs listed with shadow ministerial jobs.

’A whole load of people are going to be disappointed,’ said one Labour frontbencher.

’In opposition it's great handing out these jobs, but the rules are clear and people who have been shadowing departments for years will be left out in the cold.

’It's not a great way to start a new government, is it?’

One solution to the overall cap on paid ministers is a loophole which allows more frontbenchers, as long as they do not get a salary.

However, Labour was highly critical of David Cameron’s decision to downgrade the pay and status of the leader of the House of Lords Lady Stowell.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘All ministerial posts are in the gift of the prime minister.’

At the Labour conference in Manchester today, Mr Balls used his keynote speech to announce plans to cut ministerial pay.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls used his speech to conference today to promise that if Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister, he will cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent

He said Mr Miliband and all of the Shadow Cabinet ‘are clear it will mean cuts and tough decisions and we will take the lead’.

Mr Balls added: ‘If we win the election, on day one of the next Labour government, the pay of every government Minister will immediately be cut by five per cent.

‘Ministerial pay will then be frozen each year until we have achieved our promise to balance the nation’s books

‘Because we are all clear that everybody in the next Labour government will be fully focused on that vital task of getting the deficit down.’
