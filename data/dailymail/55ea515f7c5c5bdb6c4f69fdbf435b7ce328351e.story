An elderly man has survived ten days in the remote Nevada desert by eating snow and using tips he learned as a Boy Scout.

James Klemovich, 76, was found in good health by military personnel but his travel partner was discovered dead around a mile from the stranded car after he went to find help. 

Mr Klemovich, from  Littleton, Colorado, had been exploring a mine he co-owned with 75-year-old Laszlo Szabo of Lovelock, Nevada.

Pershing County Sheriff Richard Machado said Mr Klemovich and his friend got lost on March 18.

They were reported missing by family members who hadn't heard from them in several days.

The 76-year-old, who is diabetic, was treated at a hospital in Fallon, Nevada and has since been released.

He also wears a pacemaker and has had triple bypass heart surgery.

An autopsy was being carried out on Mr Szabo.

According to Mr Klemovich's wife, Joanne, the pair had become stuck on an isolated road with no cell phone reception.

The men tried unsuccessfully to dislodge
the car, and lit flares and started fires in the hope that  someone 
would see them in northwestern Nevada's Pershing County, an area where 
less than 7,000 people live spread out over more than 6,000 square 
miles.

They used a towel to strain ditch water and snow into water bottles but after four or five days, Mr Szabo left to get help.

Mrs Klemovich said she began to worry when several days had passed without a phone call from her husband.

She said: 'I figured maybe they'd had an accident and they were stranded. I thought maybe they were in a mine shaft. All kinds of things were going through my head.'

Mrs Klemovich said she had been expecting the worst when authorities called on Tuesday night to say her husband had been found by military personnel.

'I thought it was bad news, but it 
was very good news,' she said by telephone from the couple's home. 'I 
didn't know what to even do or say.'

Mr Klemovich managed to keep his 
spirits up while waiting for his friend's return by keeping a journal of how 
much water he drank and what he did each day. He also wrote a letter to 
his wife.

I figured maybe they had an accident 
and they were stranded. I thought maybe they were in a mine shaft. All 
kinds of things were going through my head.

The military personnel came across the Lincoln Town Car with Klemovich inside. They gave him a banana, two mandarin oranges and three boiled eggs, he told his wife.

The 76-year-old has been waiting in Nevada for his car to be recovered before he drives home to his wife.

Mrs Klemovich said her husband hasn't been talking much about his friend who died and that she did not know whether Mr Szabo has any close relatives.

'When I first talked to him I could tell he'd been through an ordeal,' she said. 'When he called back, he sounded pretty good.'

She said she would wish her husband of 48 years a 'happy belated anniversary' after he missed their special date yesterday.
