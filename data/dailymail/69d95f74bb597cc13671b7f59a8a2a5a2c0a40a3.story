Juan Martin del Potro has undergone surgery on his left wrist for a second time.

The former US Open champion made his return to the tour earlier this month after going under the knife last March.

He reached the quarter-finals in Sydney but admitted he was still feeling pain when he hit his two-handed backhand and Del Potro subsequently withdrew from the Australian Open.

Del Potro practised in Melbourne ahead of the tournament but felt pain in his wrist

In an effort to cure the problem once and for all, the 26-year-old travelled to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to undergo what was described as minor surgery.

Del Potro was again operated on by Dr Richard Berger, who carried out last year's operation as well as the one on his right wrist that sidelined him for most of 2010.

The Argentine posted a picture on his Facebook page alongside Dr Berger showing his left arm in plaster.

He wrote: 'A few hours ago I was in Australia, today at the Mayo Clinic. As recommended by my doctor, I underwent a minor surgery to fix the problem that caused me pain in the wrist.

'I feel more determined than ever to return to the courts sooner than later, to play tennis without feeling pain and to enjoy the love that you give me. I will begin rehabilitation in two weeks.'
