Luke Shaw came on for the second half of Manchester United's friendly against Inter Milan, despite bizarrely not being initially named on the bench by Louis van Gaal.

Less than a day after Van Gaal raised doubts about the £27million signing's fitness it initially appeared he had been snubbed by his new manager with Ashley Young preferred at left wing back.

The former Southampton full-back trained on his own at Washington Redskins' FedEx Field just hours before kick-off on Tuesday night. He had also trained alone on Monday night while Van Gaal put the rest of the squad through ball drills.

Raring to go: Luke Shaw was handed the chance to impress Louis van Gaal against Inter Milan

Chance: Shaw will be determined to make the left-back spot his own this season

Shaw, 19, trained on his own at Washington Redskins’ FedEx Field on Monday night as Van Gaal put the rest of the Manchester United squad through ball drills ahead of the Inter game.

Asked at a post-training press conference why Shaw worked alone, United manager Van Gaal said: 'I am always a trainer who sees the individuals and what each player needs.

'Luke needs to be fit and he’s not very fit and can’t perform how I want. He needs to be fit and to train individually.

'I can’t judge why. I see what I see. I have spoken with him and we have made a programme with him.

'He has agreed. We will have to see how long it takes. I don’t know.

'I have heard good messages from Tony Strudwick the fitness coach.'
