Sergio Perez is confident of following in the footsteps of team-mate Nico Hulkenberg in being retained by Force India for next season.

Force India confirmed on Monday that Hulkenberg would again form one half of their driver line-up for 2015, but with no word on Perez.

The 24-year-old Mexican joined the Silverstone-based outfit for this season after being ditched by McLaren at the end of last term.

Although outscored by Hulkenberg, with Perez 29 points behind the German with three grand prixs remaining, Press Association Sport understands he will stay on with Force India.

'I want to close out my situation,' said Perez.

'We're now coming towards the end of the year, and I think in the next week or so it will be done with (regards to) my future.

'Getting the deal done is now my main priority.'

In particular, Perez is keen on stability as this season represents his fourth in F1, but with a third different team after starting out at Sauber before moving on to McLaren.

Hulkenberg was assured of his future at Force India earlier this week, but Perez is yet be given confirmation

'The only opportunity I had to establish myself in a team was with Sauber in 2012, and I want to do the same here,' added Perez.

'I've made really good progress with the team, although I'm losing my race engineer for next year (Gianpiero Lambiase).

'It's always a blow when you lose an engineer you have built up a relationship with, but I believe I've enough experience to work with anyone.

'I've also good information on what is going on, how this team works, which will help me be very strong for next year.'
