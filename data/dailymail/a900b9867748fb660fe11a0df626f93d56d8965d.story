A football club's giant seagull mascot allegedly challenged his own supporters to a fight after launching into a foul-mouthed tirade during a match.

The bizarre spat came after Torquay United's mascot Gilbert the Gull was spotted arguing with the home team's fans as they crashed to a 3-2 defeat against Grimsby Town at the weekend.

Shortly after the game, fans took to the Devon team's website to complain about the the character's alleged bad language and threatening gestures, which came as the visitors scored their third goal with 20 minutes to go.

The Torquay mascot Gilbert the Gull is alleged to have sworn at his own fans and challenged them to a fight

They accused the seagull mascot of calling the supporters a bunch of c**** before using the gestures towards them.

One supporter told the fans' forum: 'Around five minutes after Grimsby scored their third, Gilbert came over to us and shouted "where’s the drummer!"

'We all thought he was having a laugh, but then he called us a bunch of "c****" and after a few words exchanged he waddled off back to the Family Stand.

But Steve Jegat, the man who has been donning the novelty costume for the past year has denied swearing at supporters

'At the end of the game, Gilbert came over again and in front of us on the pitch, he gave the "come on then" body language towards us and wouldn't stop until hiding behind the stewards and again waddling off as we moved towards the exits.

'I (and many others) complained to the stewards about this and I personally spoke to Andrew Candy about this issue and he will be having a word.

'We have the worst mascot in football.'

While another supporter added: 'The mascot was, and no doubt about it, offering fans on to the pitch for a fight.

'What would have happened to the club if 10 or more decided to take up the mascots offer and jumped over the wall and on to the pitch?'

However, Steve Jegat, a dad-of-two, who has been donning the novelty costume for the past year to gee up supporters denied swearing at the fans in the stand.

He said: 'Basically after Grimsby scored their third goal I went over and said "where’s the drummer gone" and ended up getting a load of abuse.

'The fans on that side had just given up. But I didn’t swear like they were trying to say.

'I went and told the stewards I’m more welcome at the away end. I even had a load of abuse on Gilbert’s Facebook page when I got home.

'They say that I’m the ambassador for the club but if I’m the ambassador why are they trying to knock me about?

'“I’m going to be there for the next home game. I do so much for the club, with charity things and other games, that when the club spoke to me they said "just stay away from the Popside".

'I went to a girls’ match the following day, and someone said to me "99 per cent of the fans are behind you - it’s just the one per cent".'

Torquay United have cleared the mascot to resume his duties at the club's ground Plainmoor, pictured, but banned him from the Popside home stand 

Torquay United chief executive Andrew Candy confirmed the club launched a probe into the incident at the Conference Premier League game and that Mr Jegat had been reprimanded for his behaviour.

However, he has cleared the mascot to resume his duties at the club's Plainmoor ground but banned him from the Popside home stand to avoid any further trouble.

Mr Candy said: 'There was an exchange of views between Gilbert and the fans in the Popside.

'Gilbert was trying to generate some support and get the fans behind the team but it appears that there was a small altercation with the fans.

'There was no malicious intent in what was said but things were said that, in hindsight, should not have been.

'Gilbert has been spoken to and been told that this should not have happened and that this will not happen in the future.'
