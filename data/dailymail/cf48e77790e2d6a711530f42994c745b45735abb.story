An Instagram account which shames men who turn hostile when rejected on dating apps has now attracted more than 300,000 followers.

The Bye Felipe Instagram account is a place where women can expose the bullying and rude reactions provoked simply by telling a man they are not interested.

As previously reported by MailOnline, the posts - which appear in the form of screen grabs - are not  for the faint-hearted and often include extremely vulgar language.

The Instagram account which shames guys who turn hostile when rejected on dating apps features posts like this one where a man calls a woman 'ugly', 'fat' and a 'heffer' for not contacting him

In another weight-related jibe, this man says a woman needs to 'lose 20lbs' after she politely tells him she doesn't think they are a match when he asks her on a date

Apart from the disturbing choice of words, the retorts are often nasty and expose a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour.

It seems previous publicity surrounding the account has not made men wary of what they say in messages as a plethora of new posts have been added in recent weeks.

For example, one man turns ugly after a woman refuses to tell him why she isn't responding to his messages.

He writes: 'Can't be cuz (sic) I'm over weight cuz you're even more fat... can't be cuz I'm ugly because you're uglier.' When she fails to respond again, he calls her a 'heffer'.

As this example shows, a theme which often arises in the abusive messages is weight. 

The retorts, like this one where a man starts name calling after his messages are ignored, display a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour

In this post a woman is called a 'fat ass' for not replying to messages

Another man calls a woman a 'fat pig' and 'fat and ugly' after she ignores him. Many other similar messages on the Instagram account are unsuitable for publication 

Another rejected man suggests he and the woman would be more compatible 'if you lost 20lb'.

Meanwhile, another calls a girl a 'fat pig' after ignoring him on the site. 

These are sadly the least offensive of the posts online - most are unsuitable for publication.

The account was created by American Alexandra Tweten as a means of allowing women to name and shame men who trolled them.

'I realised these hostile messages were a trend that women see online,' the operations coordinator told The Huffington Post.

'All women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites.'

Alexandra hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realise that they are not alone. And having sifted through a seemingly-endless stream of submissions, she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers.

'It's a standard reaction that I've now seen over and over again with the submissions,' she added.

'Guy hits on girl, girl doesn't respond, guy lashes out with insulting message. It really shows the entitlement these guys feel, and I think it shows our cultural misogyny problem.' 

CleverPoint, a technology consulting company based in San Francisco, decided to put Alexandra's claims to the test and created an experiment to examine male behaviour on dating sites.

The company built a Tinder robot using pictures from a willing volunteer, Lisa Winning, a CEO of dating network HeTexted.

The robot right-swiped on 1,000 profiles of men in San Francisco and another 1,000 in New York City.

Over a thousand men messaged Lisa - but since this was a robot and not actually her, none of the guys received any responses.

'We were afraid they’d become hostile after being ignored, like we’d seen on Bye Felipe so many times before,' says Paul Mestemaker, who runs CleverPoint.

But out of 1,007 men who messaged Lisa, none became hostile when they didn't receive a response. 

'Just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful. Sure, there was teasing, guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up, and plenty of bad pickup lines. But no one became hostile or resorted to name-calling,' he says. 

The findings may make women feel more confident about dating this Valentine's Day given the Bye Felipe Instagram account is enough to put anyone off looking for love online.
