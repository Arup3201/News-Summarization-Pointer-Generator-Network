A 21-year-old graduate student missing since late last week has been found safe and unharmed several states from where his family were expecting him authorities say, but exactly where, they refuse to say.

Matthew Royer, a University of Rhode Island doctorate student, was found in North Carolina on Thursday, WPVI reports, after his parents say he set out from the school for their Pennsylvania home one week earlier.

He has since been reunited with family in an undisclosed location with a cause for his mysterious disappearance also left unsaid.

Found: Matthew Royer, 21, who was missing for exactly one week before found on Thursday is seen in an undated photo released by the Pennsylvania State Police during their search efforts

'The family requests that the media not contact them nor reveal his location as they wish to consider this a private and closed matter,' a statement by State Police said on Thursday.

In state police's last search update on Monday they said it was possible Royer 'voluntarily' disappeared.

They didn't say exactly why but that they were 'pursuing all leads,' ABC reported at the time.

A university spokeswoman said Royer, who was studying pharmacy, hadn't been taking any classes last semester but was still registered as a student.

His mother told police she was expecting him home for summer break where he’d work at a golf club in Pennsylvania starting that Friday.

Mystery: Royer told his mother on Thursday night that he was heading home with plans to start a summer job at a Pennsylvania golf club on Friday which he failed to show up for

When he didn’t show up for work that day, she called police, launching the manhunt that spread throughout the northeast.

Janet Royer told police he sent her a text message around 6.30pm on Thursday telling her that he was heading home, an about five-hour drive, after oversleeping.

Leading up to disappearance: Royer was pursing a doctorate in pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island but hadn't been taking classes this past semester according to a university spokeswoman

At 2.05am the next morning he was instead seen leaving a gas station near Allentown, Pennsylvania, just 35 miles north of his family's home.

'He bought water at the station, he opened it in the car and headed southbound on 100. He looked fine, not distraught,' his mother, Janet Royer, told ABC News' Philadelphia affiliate.

Roughly 11 hours later at 1pm his vehicle, a silver 2008 Chevy Cobalt, was reported driving only an hour away from his home in Lebanon County. Who was behind the wheel wasn't known.

Fuelling his family's worst fears, authorities said his cell phone stopped working around noon on Saturday.

'You couldn't ask for a better son. It's not like him, if he wasn't coming home he would've told me he wasn't coming home, unless he couldn't,' his mother, Janet Royer told WPVI on Sunday.

Royer had moved most of his belongings out of his apartment near the University of Rhode Island a few weeks prior to his disappearance. His family says he still had some items packed in his vehicle when he disappeared, including a laptop computer and other electronic devices.

The owner of his apartment told police he returned his keys before leaving.

Royer's family says he has a good relationship with everyone, and would have no reason to run away.
