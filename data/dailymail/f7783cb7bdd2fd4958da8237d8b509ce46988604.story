Katie Couric has launched an extraordinary attack on Kate Middleton and claimed that she is ‘getting too thin’.

The TV show host said that the Duchess of Cambridge needed to put on some weight - or she might not have her as a guest on her new programme.

Couric also renewed her attack on her former employers at CBS and said she should have been ‘more circumspect’ about working with the company.

Her comments about the Duchess are likely to cause outrage at Buckingham Palace which granted her extensive access to the Royal family during a recent special for ABC News, where is a special correspondent.

She made them during the filming of the first episode of her new chat show Katie in response to audience questions about who her dream guest would be.

Couric said that Kate would be her choice but there was one issue: ‘I think she's getting too thin.’

Kate reportedly lost 10lbs and went from a size eight to a size six in the weeks before her marriage to Prince William in order to fit into her wedding dress.

She was reportedly on the Dukan Diet which limits those on it to just protein like fish during the first, most brutal stage.

This is not the first time Kate’s weight has come us as other commentators have raised concerns she may be getting too thin, especially if she wants to have a baby.

The Royal Household has also been sensitive to weight issues since 1995 when Princess Diana publicly admitted that she suffered from bulimia and made herself vomit after eating.

When interviewer Martin Bashir asked her what the Royal Family thought of her problems, Diana replied: ‘They thought it was a waste of food’.

Speaking to USA Today, Couric also laid into CBS again where she hosted the Evening News for five years before leaving under acrimonious circumstances.

Couric had claimed that working there left her she felt ‘constrained’ and that departing was like being ‘liberated’.

In her latest interview she said: ‘Ultimately I'm very proud of the work I did, but really tinkering with the format of a newscast might have been more difficult than initially thought by everyone.

‘In hindsight I probably should have examined that more carefully: Could you really change the format in a way that it would capitalize on my particular skill set, which is doing interviews, interacting, being more spontaneous, being a little more casual.

‘Nobody has a crystal ball, but I wish I'd been a little more circumspect about the possibility of doing that.’

Couric - who is famous for her controlled public image - added that even though she expects her chat show guests to open up, she will not be doing so herself.

She said: ‘Only when it's relevant and only when it's a natural part of the conversation.

‘If we're talking about dating over 50, I might say what my attitude is about it. I'm not going to talk about the date I had the night before.

‘I want to talk about my own experiences, but I don't want to overshare.’

One of those experiences was her five-year relationship with Brooks Perlin, a man 17 years her junior.

They broke up in December of last year, but the stigma of older women dating younger men has clearly stuck with her.

In
the same USA Today article, Couric is quoted talking with Academy Award
winner Susan Sarandon who is currently dating a much younger man after 
splitting with her long-time partner Tim Robbins.

'I
wonder if that bugs you as much as it bugs me,' Couric said of the fact
that their is no true male equivalent for the addage 'cougar' that both
women had been labeled with for their respective relationships.

They settled on 'sugar daddies' in the end.

Comments over the Duchess' weight will likely anger Royal representatives because Couric was granted unbridled access to them during the Jubilee
