He's known for his sporting prowess on the polo field but Prince Harry also cuts a fine figure in a rugby shirt.

The royal pulled on a Wasps shirt as the club have joined support for the Invictus Games. 

As part of the alliance, Wasps players will wear a limited edition away shirt during their London double header against Saracens on Saturday to raise awareness for the tournament which is being championed by the prince.

United for a good cause: Wasps captain James Haskell and Prince Harry in the special edition shirts the rugby players will wear to publicise the Invictus Games

Prince Harry, 29, modelled the shirt today alongside Wasps captain James Haskell, who Tweeted a picture of them both on Instagram.

He wrote: 'Great to catch up with HRH, and show him Wasps support for the amazing Invictus Games. Go, watch and support these truly inspiring games. We are wearing the kit for the London Double Header, this Saturday.'

He jokingly added: 'I have been trying to get him in a Wasps (@waspsrugby) shirt for years, finally found a way! He looks sharp.'

The Invictus Games is an international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick service personnel that will take place at the London 2012 Olympic venues from 10-14 September.

Getting involved: Prince Harry announced plans for the games earlier this year when he also tried playing hand ball, right

Haskell said: 'It's fantastic that Wasps are supporting such an incredible event and giving Invictus Games another platform on which to boost its profile during their first year.

'Over the past few years it has been brilliant to see the overwhelming support for our Armed Forces and a genuine appreciation of the incredible job they do to protect us. I know there is no prouder moment than to represent your country. These guys do it daily, and their commitment, regardless of the risk to themselves, is inspirational.

'You often hear in rugby about players putting their bodies on the line. It's a tough, physical game, but let's face it, it's incomparable to the dangers Service personnel face, and I have so much respect for what they sacrifice in the line of duty.

Ready for battle: Last month the royal revealed the British team, made up from wounded service men and women, who will do their country proud again - this time in a sporting arena

'These are men and women who have suffered life-changing injuries, but still refuse to be beaten. To watch them compete at the Invictus Games will be inspirational and I'd encourage people to get down to the venues to cheer them on.'

The Invictus Games are being organised with the support and backing of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry and the Ministry of Defence. 

They will feature more than 400 wounded, injured and sick Servicemen and women, both serving and veteran from 14 nations.

Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan as a helicopter pilot, has been a driving force in getting the inaugural games off the ground and he hopes it will become an annual event.

Landmark event: Tower Bridge was lit up this week to celebrate the games

When he announced the details for the tournament earlier this year he said: 'I have witnessed first-hand how the power of sport can positively impact the lives of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women in their journey of recovery.

'The Invictus Games will focus on what they can achieve post-injury and celebrate their fighting spirit through an inclusive sporting competition that recognises the sacrifice they have made.

'I am extremely proud to be bringing an event like this to the UK for the first time and believe it can have a long-lasting impact on the well-being of those who have served their nations so bravely.'
