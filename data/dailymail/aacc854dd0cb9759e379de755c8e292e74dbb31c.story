Russian Alexander Kudryavtsev has allegedly labelled the behaviour of Australian tennis fans as 'animals' during his five-set loss to Aussie favourite Marinko Matosevic.

It was a moment of triumph for Matosevic who broke his six-year drought, winning his first ever match at the Australian Open at Melbourne Park on Monday.

As fans packed the Show Court 3 on day one of the tennis tournament, the roaring crowd didn't distract Matosevic from defeating Kudryavtsev in five sets 6-4 6-7(5) 4-6 7-5 6-3.

But Kudryavtsev appeared frustrated at the rowdy crowd during the match as he complained and alerted the umpire for the disruptive noise following a double-fault in the fourth set.

'They are animals,' the Russian was heard saying to the umpire.

'I don't think they were [animals] - I thought it was a very fair crowd,' Matosevic said.

'The crowd was unbelievable - I thought like very respectful.
