He has spawned a book, seen his catchphrase added to the dictionary and is credited with turning a little-known comparison website into a market leader.

Not bad for a Russian meerkat with a poor grasp of English.

But Aleksandr Orlov now faces an uncertain future after reports emerged that Comparethemarket.com may soon be cutting him and his meerkat pals loose.

Simples! Aleksandr, the Russian meerkat who has helmed the marketing for Comparethemarket.com for four years, may soon be out of a job

Replacement: It has been reported that the instantly-recognisable mascot is to be abandoned by the company in favour of cult comedy actor Robert Webb

Advert star: Aleksandr the Meerkat stars in an earlier version of the Comparethemarket.com advert

The Mirror reported that the 
instantly-recognisable mascot is being abandoned by the company in 
favour of cult comedy actor and star of Peep Show Robert Webb.

A marketing source told the paper: 'The meerkat adverts are so popular and are loved by many, but there is a view that they should be ended before people get bored with it.'

Aleksandr first appeared four years ago in mock public service ads warning people not to confuse his website Comparethemeerkat.com with the online insurance comparison site.

The adverts featuring Aleksandr are regarded as one of the UK's most successful campaigns

The campaign included the catchphrase 'simples', which became so widely-used it entered the Collins English Dictionary.

It was expanded into a series of 15 ads showing the cravat-wearing meerkat's family history and was tied into a promotion where anyone who took insurance with Comparethemarket got a cuddly toy.

On October 28, 2010 Aleksandr had his first television interview on the ITV show Daybreak.

The campaign even resulted in an autobiography called A Simples Life: The Life And Times of Aleksandr Orlov.

Pre-orders for the book beat the autobiography of ex-PM Tony Blair.

The new adverts with Robert Webb gently poke fun at Aleksandr, pointing out 'meerkat' and 'market' sound different and are spelled very differently.

Comparethemarket.com released a statement using Aleksandr's quirky language patterns.

It said: 'As long as peoples are confuse meerkats with markets then I will always be fight the cause with advertisements.'

A corporate representative was not available for comment today.
