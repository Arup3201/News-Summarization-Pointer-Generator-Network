An author of legal thrillers and a fantasy trilogy who was charged with scamming two women he met on a Jewish dating site out of millions of dollars is planning to plead guilty to some charges.

Author Mitchell Gross' attorney Jerry Froelich declined to say which charges his client would plead to at a federal court hearing on Tuesday.

The wire fraud and money laundering charges he faces could carry a maximum prison sentence of decades behind bars.

Thriller writer Mitchell Gross, here in a publicity photo and his mugshot, allegedly convinced girlfriends he met online to invest millions in a sham company that led directly to his bank account and callously stopped calling them  once he had their money

Gross, whose books include the 
suspense story ‘Circle of Lies,’ was charged in October with duping 
least two women into investing about $4.4million in a sham company he 
set up, using some of the money to buy expensive artwork, a luxury car 
and a golf club membership.

The 61-year-old author pleaded not guilty to the charges at a court hearing in October.

Authorities said Gross began a 
romantic relationship with a woman identified in court documents as 
‘R.J.,’ but identified in court as Robbie Johnson.

They met through an online Jewish 
dating site around June 2006 and he bragged about making a lot of money 
by investing with a broker named ‘Michael Johnson’ who was employed by 
‘The Merrill Company,’ the records show.

Ms Johnson called the fictional broker
to talk over the investments, but it was actually Gross speaking in a 
disguised voice on the other line, prosecutors said.

She then wired close to $3million to 
an account she believed belong to the company but actually did not 
exist, prosecutors said.

News to them! Gross bragged that film versions of his books would star Kirsten Dunst and Pierce Brosnan

Gross concealed the scheme by sending her phony tax forms and account statements, they added.

Then, investigators said they discovered he was using the woman's funds to repay an ex-girlfriend, identified as ‘J.S.’

Gross also falsely claimed to the girlfriends that Steven Spielberg had optioned his books to make films

She was earlier duped into investing at least $1.4million with the phony firm, prosecutors said.

Ms Johnson, a Florida real estate 
agent, claimed in a March 2008 lawsuit against Gross that soon after 
meeting her online, he falsely told her that celebrities had optioned 
his books and that he had fallen in love with her.

They took vacations together to Japan, Panama and Brazil, and she hosted a ‘Meet Mitch’ party to introduce him to her friends.

But after he got the money — about 
$2.95million — he started making excuses to avoid spending time with 
her, and delayed moving in together, the lawsuit said.

The relationship ended in March 2008, when she discovered the account she was pumping money into was set up under Gross' name.

Gross, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, 
has written six books under the Mitchell Graham pen name, including a 
three-part science fiction series and a legal thriller called ‘Dead 
Docket.’

Court records also say he wrote ‘Circle of Lies’ under the pen name Douglas Alan.
