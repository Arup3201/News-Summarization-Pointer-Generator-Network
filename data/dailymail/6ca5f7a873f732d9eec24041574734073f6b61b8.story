The high-priced prostitute accused of injecting a Google executive with a fatal dose of heroin is now considered a suspect in the death a former boyfriend in Atlanta.

Alix Tichelman, 26, has been charged with manslaughter and drug charges after 51-year-old Forrest Hayes was found dead November 23 of a drug overdose on his yacht. Former flame Dean Riopelle, also 51, reportedly died under similar circumstances only months prior.

The investigation into Riopelle's death - from an overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol - has been reopened, police told WSB.

Similar: Riopelle, shown in this undated photo, loved animals and was, by all accounts, well-liked. His death shocked many

'It's
 still conjecture looking at the similarities of the two situations, but
 obviously we're going to go back and look at it and make sure that 
everything determined to be correct, almost a year ago, is still factual
 and still accurate,' said Capt. Shawn McCarty with the Milton Police Department.

Tichelman claimed at the time that Riopelle had been drinking and shooting heroin all day, police said.

The call girl was also arrested for biting Riopelle, McCarty recalled to the station. She was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and falsely reporting a crime, records showed. It is not clear if she was formally charged.

Riopelle, once the lead singer for the Impotent Sea Snakes, lived in fear or Tichelman, according to at least one friend.

'At
 first he was really happy. But toward the end, he had a lot of fears of
 her. He even tried to stop her from going to his own club,' Michael Lacy told the San Francisco Chronicle.

The shocking revelations came just a day after it was revealed Tichman wrote chillingly on Facebook about her 'love' of killing sprees shortly before her July 4 arrest.Â

Heartless: Alix Tichelman, 26, appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face manslaughter and drug charges in relation to the November 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. Prosecutors are accusing Tichelman, a call girl, of leaving Hayes to die of a drug overdose

 'sugar babies' with rich, older, men and women

Tichelman was fascinated with the topic of serial murders, according to posts she wrote on Facebook just last month.

'Really
 nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in 
cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post.

'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added.

Tichelman appeared Wednesday in Santa Cruz court to face 
manslaughter and drug charges in connection to the November 2013 death 
of Google exec Forrest Hayes, 51.

Surveillance
 footage obtained by investigators shows Tichelman injecting Hayes with 
heroin, and then casually leaving him to die when he has an adverse 
reaction to the drug.

And
 this may not have been Tichelman's first killing, as detectives are 
also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

Stone cold: The high-priced prostitute didn't look worried when she appeared in court on July 9

No plea yet: Tichelman has not yet entered a plea, and was assigned a public defender in court on Wednesday

In court on Wednesday, Tichelman did not enter a plea and was assigned a public defender.

Tichelman
 has been held on $1.5million bond since her July 4 arrest, when she met
 with an undercover cop at a Santa Cruz hotel who said he wanted to pay 
her $1,000 for sex.

The
 high-priced prostitute allegedly met Hayes, the married father of five,
 on website 'Seeking Arrangement' which pairs 'sugar babies' with rich 
older men or women.

Police say the two met a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter.

That
 day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small 
Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the 
drug, police said.

Surveillance
 video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical 
complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt
 to help him or call 911, police said.

Instead,
 she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to 
finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window 
blind down to conceal his body from outside.

Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported.

'She
 showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' 
Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday.

Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim.

'We know they've had a previous 
relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION.

'This was all set up 
through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the 
aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google 
searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of 
this.'

Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said.

They
 then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her 
parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County for the July 4 arrest.

When
 asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said 
evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder 
rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported.

Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online

'She showed
 absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark 
said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.'

Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

Hayes,
 who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to 
wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his 
obituary.

He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google.

'Forrest
 will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than 
anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on 
his boat,' according to a January obituary.

'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.'

Tichelman's
 Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before 
majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty 
school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist

According to Tichelman's Facebook, she went to 
high school in Atlanta before attending George State University and then
 beauty school. She listed her occupation as a makeup artist

She called herself a 'model' in jail records.

On
 social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the 
camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of
 months ago.

In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character.

'I
 have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents 
said by the time I was three I was an "intense child" and already liked 
horror movies.'

She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend.

She
 also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and 
talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 
'Dexter'.

Seeking
 Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is 
described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar 
daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting 
prostitution.
