These volunteers are packing up dogs and shipping them off to Washington state from California - as part of a 'Black Dog Friday' adoption blitz.

They are shelter dogs, who were once set to be euthanized - before three charitable organizations stepped up to help find them homes. 

Holding one of the dogs affectionately in a heartwarming video, Wings of Rescue's Yehuda Netenal said: 'He's an example of how beautiful the dogs are that are being killed here in Southland, California due to lack of space.'

What dog lover wouldn't be interested in adopting this little cutie - and it's up for adoption

The dogs are prepared for their flight from California to Washington state for a better life

Dog shelters are over-crowded in the southern part of California, US, but loving families are already awaiting these pups.

Bark Me Foundation's Melanie Pozzezz added: 'There are people waiting on the tarmac for these dogs. These dogs have been all over their social media and their websites. 

'They know the dogs that are coming and the volunteers and potential adopters are standing on the tarmac waiting for them to get off the airplane.'

Many of the dogs are euthanized as there is simply not enough space for them in California

 Bark Me Foundation's Melanie Pozzezz believes social media is helping the re-homing process

The next shipload of dogs is due to fly out from California to Washington on December 5

The rescue operation is all part of a Black Dog Friday adoption effort as the canines are granted new homes just in time for Christmas. 

'They all get adopted. And it helps drive even more traffic to their local shelters and their dogs that they already have in them,' Pozzezz added.

The dogs keep barking and the planes keep flying. The next 500 dogs will head to New York City on December 5.
