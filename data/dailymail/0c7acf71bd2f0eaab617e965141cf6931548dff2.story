Three men have been caught on camera risking their lives by dangling their legs over the edge of Beachy Head to pose for a photo.

The friends took it in turns to perch over the crumbling 500ft high cliff as the others took snaps of them at the beauty spot near Eastbourne, East Sussex.

Eye-witness Guy Hollingsworth filmed the three as the put themselves in danger for up to 15 minutes as families walked by.

Worryingly several families walking past just a few feet away fail to notice the men behave recklessly at the beauty spot

This is the shocking moment a group of men risk their lives by posing for photographs, while dangling their legs over a crumbling 500ft high cliff

Mr Hollingsworth, 41, from nearby Seaford, said: 'It is ridiculously dangerous, people don't understand just how dangerous it is.

'If they could see the cracks underneath them and the under-hangings where the are lying they wouldn't go anywhere near it.

'They really shouldn't go anywhere near it at all.'

Mr Hollingsworth, from nearby Seaford, filmed the group on Sunday afternoon as he went walking along a nearby coastal path with a friend.

The group, who were taking it in turns to pose perilously close to the edge, were filmed at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, East Sussex

The photographer, who regularly sees people balancing precariously close to the edge, sent an unmanned drone up into the air to capture the men's actions.

He added: 'They were there for a good 10 to 15 minutes, to put his own and others life's in danger is disgusting and he should be ashamed at his actions.

'If children had seen this and copied it could of been a tragic afternoon.

'Lots of people walk by without even a glance, it has become the normal for people to do this, what does it need to stop this.

'I asked the person I was with to ask them to step away from the edge, but by the time they had got down there over 20 people had walked by them without a word, they had also moved on.

'I had no phone reception or I would of phoned the police myself. It goes without saying, stay away from the edge.'

Three men were pictured in March doing exactly the same thing at a similar spot at Beachy Head. Worryingly, several children were seen standing only a few feet away.

A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'Coastguard advice is to stay away from cliff edges - they can be crumbly or slippery when wet.

'Do not attempt to climb up or down cliffs unless you are trained and equipped to do so.'
