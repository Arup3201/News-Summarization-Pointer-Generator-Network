The latest legal filing in the Bode Miller custody battle claims that the skier’s 13-month-old son had trouble recognizing his own mother because the Olympian has kept the boy away from his ex for more than a month.

The custody battle between Miller and his ex girlfriend Sara McKenna over their son rages on over the boy- who is called Nate by his father and Sam by his mother.

Miller and his wife Morgan Beck had custody of 'Nate' for the past five weeks and had originally agreed to allow McKenna to have custody of the boy for the whole month of April.

Back in court: A New York judge ruled against Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck's request to extend their time with his son, who they call 'Nate', after having custody of him for the past five weeks (pictured today)

Throwing claims: The California-based couple were in New York for a previously scheduled custody hearing but because his ex, the boy's mother Sara McKenna was sick it had to be pushed back by two weeks

Miller and Beck were seen walking out of the Manhattan courthouse on Monday after petitioning to change that earlier schedule.

They wanted to extend their time with 'Nate' because his half sister- Miller's daughter from a previous relationship- has off from school for the week and they wanted the children to spend time together.

Miller lives in California with his wife, a professional volleyball player.

The last time they were in court, they were arguing over whether or not he would be able to take ‘Nate’ to Sochi with him for the winter Olympic Games- and the judge ruled in his favor that time, meaning that the boy was there when he won a bronze medal.

Bronze: Miller was allowed to bring 'Nate' with him to Russia for the Sochi Games, where he came in third

Husband and wife: Miller married Beck (pictured above at Sochi in February) in October 2012 and the two lost a child in a miscarriage the following January

Trying for more time: Miller, seen here with 'Nate' earlier this winter, wanted to have more time with the boy so that he could overlap time in California with Miller's daughter's break from school

McKenna's lawyers said that the change should not be approved because 'my client has seen repercussions' of her son being away for so long already.

'Her son looked at her as if to say, "Who exactly are you?"' McKenna's lawyer Bill Beslow told the court on Monday, according to The New York Daily News.

McKenna, a former Marine and firefighter who is now a student at Columbia University in New York, had her lawyer argue that her son has been taken to 'a myriad of locations' during the past five weeks and did not need to go back on another cross-country flight.

She also arranged to have her relatives visit her in New York next to spend time with 'Sam', working under the assumption that she would have custody of him for the whole month.

Reunited: McKenna won custody of Sam back in November and the two are currently together in New York

The judge ruled against Miller's request to take the boy immediately, but did agree that he can take him to his home in California for a week on the 14th.

The Daily News reports that Miller and Beck, who he met and married months after breaking up with McKenna, were in New York because a custody hearing was set for today but it has since been postponed until the 21st because McKenna has food poisoning.

Miller's lawyer threw one final barb at the boy's biological mother saying that she was faking the illness in order to avoid today's court appearance, but her lawyer denied the claim.
