Two pit bulls have mauled a homeless woman to death in Texas, before turning on the two men that came to her aid.

The victims were attacked around 2am on Glen Prairie and Leonora in Southeast Houston.

One of the dogs was caught immediately after the attack - described as been about one-year-old and weighing 30 pounds - and will likely be euthanized, but City of Houston Animal Control have not been able to locate the second, according to Chron.

Police are yet to released the name of the deceased, but neighbors told ABC Local she was a regular in the area and in her 40s.

The woman was described as being petite and non-threatening and had been seen panhandling around dusk.

One man, Osby Pineles, said he was on his way to the corner store to buy cigarettes when they saw the woman on the ground, with the two dogs pulling at her body.

The 21-year-old said he tried to get the dogs off the woman but they turned on him, bloodying his legs, arms and hands.

"The dog knocked me down," said Pineles, who was treated at Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital.

His friend, who quickly started knocking on nearby houses for help, received minor injuries.

Animal control officers are working to take custody of the second dog.

Its believed they have found the residence where the dog lives, but the tenant wasn't home or did not answer the door, according to ABC Local.

Once properly identified, the owner could face criminal charges.

The animal in custody lives in a nearby apartment complex and has a biting history, neighbors said.

The dog does not show symptoms of rabies, but is currently under quarantine for further examination.

A municipal hearing will be held to determine its fate.

Neighbors say they often see dogs roaming the neighborhood and several houses carry 'Beware of dog' signs.

Dog attacks killed 32 people in the U.S. in 2013.

Pit bulls or pit-bull mixes were blamed for 25 of those deaths, according to DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victim group dedicated to raising awareness of the public health and safety issue.

'When dogs congregate in more than one or two, especially when they are allowed to roam freely, this kind of incident can occur,' Glaser said, warning of the 'pack mentality' of dogs.

A 52-year-old woman was mauled by 15 mixed-breed stray dogs on a Houston street last July, he said.

After the pack of dogs surrounded her and pulled her down to the ground, she suffered a heart attack, but survived.

Last January, 4-year-old Christian Gormanous was killed by a neighbor's pit bull in Conroe, Texas.Â
