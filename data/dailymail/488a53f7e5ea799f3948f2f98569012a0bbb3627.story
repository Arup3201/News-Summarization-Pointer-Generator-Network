House prices have grown at their fastest pace since the financial crisis, fuelling fears that the Help to Buy scheme is inflating a new property bubble. 

In the latest sign of recovery in the housing market, an influential report from Hometrack has found that three quarters of postcodes registered price gains this year. 

This is up from just a fifth last year.

Across England and Wales, average prices rose by 4.4 per cent to £206,726 – the highest registered by Hometrack since October 2007 and a rebound from last year’s 0.3 per cent fall.

By far the biggest gains were in London and the south east, with average prices growing 9.1 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.

The average price of a house in London is now £422,860, and Hertfordshire has the next highest average at £340,333.

Demand for housing also soared by 25 per cent, the fastest pace for three years, while the supply of new homes fell to a record low, increasing just 6 per cent. 

The report said it expected ‘the momentum in house price growth to spill over into 2014 by a continued lack of supply and rising demand’. 

The huge inbalance lends weight to concerns that the housing market is overheating following the introduction of the Government’s Help to Buy Scheme in April, which was launched to help those with small deposits get their foot on the property ladder.

But over the next fortnight leading forecasters are expected to show that the housing market has been turbo-charged by the Help to Buy scheme and a glut of cheap mortgage deals. 

Halifax’s latest index is expected to show prices rose 8.1 per cent in the year to December, the fastest since October 2007.

Meanwhile, Nationwide is set to predict growth of 7.1 per cent, which would be the best since June 2010. This raft of data is likely to be latched on by critics of Help to Buy, ranging from business secretary Vince Cable to former Bank of England governor Lord King. 

They argue that Help to Buy is artificially driving up house prices – particularly in London and the south east – because there are not enough homes to cope with soaring demand. 

The Institute for Public Policy Research, the prominent left-leaning think-tank, also warned this weekend that the Chancellor ‘risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the Help to Buy scheme’.

It fears a repeat of the massive build-up of household debt before 2008, which contributed to the financial crisis. 

But supporters of the scheme – including David Cameron – have played down the concerns.The Hometrack report shows a stark north-south divide in the housing market. 

The north was the only region to see a drop in prices, of 0.5 per cent, while homeowners in the north east experienced an average rise of just 0.5 per cent. 

In Merseyside the average house is now £149,300 and in Teesside it is £141,400.

Hometrack said a ‘broader based recovery in the housing market is dependent on growth in the real economy, jobs and household incomes’.
