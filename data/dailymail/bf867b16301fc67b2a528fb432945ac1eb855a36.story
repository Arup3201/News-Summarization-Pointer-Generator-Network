Graham Dorrans remembers the moment vividly. He was at West Bromwich Albion’s Birmingham Road training ground when the phone call came that would put his life on hold. His baby daughter was in hospital with suspected meningitis.

‘It was pre-season and we’d been training,’ recalls Dorrans. ‘I got a shout that Ava had been taken into hospital but my doctor told me it was nothing to worry about so it was a real shock when I got there and saw her. It was clear it was serious. She was three months old, so fragile.’

It had been just two years since he and wife Yvonne had lost their second child, Logan, to stillbirth. Was this really happening again?

‘Seeing your child like that is the worst thing in life,’ says Dorrans. ‘It’s horrible, something you never forget. Nothing else matters but you feel so helpless. Thankfully, babies are tough.’

After an agonising two weeks of intensive care and attention, Ava pulled through.

Indeed those fighting qualities mean that Ava, fully recovered, is the livewire of the household and she is happy to share the limelight with older sister Leah, 12, and the latest Dorrans addition, baby brother Austyn.

‘She’s as bright as a button,’ says Dorrans. ‘She’s two-and-a-half now and running around everywhere. It’s lovely to come home from football to relax and see her and the other two playing so well. It’s great hearing her little laugh around the place and she’s got her big sister doing everything for her.

‘The whole experience of what we have been through has definitely brought us closer together as a family unit and you appreciate every moment that little bit more.’

The gratitude felt by Dorrans and his wife to those who cared for Ava is expressed in Yvonne’s continued push to raise funds for SANDS neonatal charity and Meningitis Now: running marathons and sky-diving from 10,000 feet. ‘I just go to watch,’ says Dorrans. ‘Besides, I’m scared of heights.’

The sense of joie de vivre in their Sutton Coldfield home has been aided by Austyn’s arrival. Now seven months old, he is already accustomed to supporting dad; resplendent in Albion kit, he proved a lucky omen on his first game against Cardiff City in March when Dorrans scored in a 3-3 draw.

Dorrans and family spend their precious time together at the local safari park or the occasional trip to Alton Towers but, like any footballer, out on the pitch is where Dorrans finds his escape. He has been at Albion since 2008 and it’s fair to say he has had his share of ups and downs. 

An often underrated midfield talent with an eye for goal, he was signed by Tony Mowbray, flourished under Roberto Di Matteo before playing for Roy Hodgson, fell out of favour under Steve Clarke then was given a fresh chance by Pepe Mel. Now under Alan Irvine, he is an ever-present and part of Scotland’s promising European Championship campaign.

‘When things happen like with Ava, football is the last thing on your mind, nothing else matters. Unfortunately, it coincided with Steve Clarke not wanting to pick me,’ remembers Dorrans. ‘Not having a game to look forward to, it was a difficult time. A few clubs came in and I came very close to leaving but the deals didn’t go through. Pepe then gave me a fresh chance, I had a run of games, signed a new deal and Alan Irvine has kept faith in me. It’s been great to get back playing.’

In those frustrating times Dorrans sought advice in the shape of coaches Dean Kiely and Keith Downing and drew support in the shape of team-mate Nicolas Anelka, who left the club after being banned for his quenelle gesture which was deemed anti-Semitic.

‘Nic was always someone who said I should be playing and when someone of his ability and calibre says that about you it gives you a lift,’ he says. ‘I was sorry to see him go. Obviously circumstances dictated it but, despite what is said about him, Nic was always a nice, calm guy around the place.’

Despite an inauspicious start this season, Albion have started to find their rhythm and results are mirroring performances, as reflected in Monday’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United.

‘Alan Irvine has brought a real freshness to the club,’ says Dorrans. ‘He’s very thorough. Whether we are playing a lower league team in the cup or Liverpool, he treats everyone with the same respect, we have a gameplan for every opposition and he’s made training enjoyable with plenty of variation. He’s serious about what he does but we can have a laugh with him too.’

Irvine had to rebuild Albion’s squad in the summer but managed to keep the core group and nurture talent such as England U21 striker Saido Berahino.

‘There’s a few of us such as Chris Brunt and James Morrison who have been here a while and that has helped the transition and the squad to gel quickly but credit to Saido. He has worked really hard and is going to be a great player. He’s already showing what he could achieve and hopefully there’s a lot more goals to come from him.’

This weekend, Dorrans faces childhood friend James McArthur of Crystal Palace. ‘We know each other well from schoolboy days and we roomed together with Scotland. He’s a good player and a good friend but I hope he has a stinker on Saturday.

‘Seriously though, every week is an exciting test in the Premier League, you’re up against some of the best players and the best teams in Europe but, as against United, we’ve matched many of them. We’ve got a good team developing. There’s a freshness and togetherness about the place, like a family bond and we feel we can get stronger.’

After his experience, that’s something Dorrans can vouch for.
