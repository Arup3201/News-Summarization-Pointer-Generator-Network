The Google search engine is a powerful and sophisticated tool, but a group of internet pranksters exploited a weak spot and persuaded it that a picture of a potato was in fact an Xbox.

A mischievous Reddit user started a thread that contained a picture of a potato and the caption ‘Gaming Console’, along with the instruction to other users to vote on it to make Google’s news algorithms believe that it’s found something true and relevant.

It said: ‘Gaming Console. If you vote this up, it will show up on Google Images when people Google search Gaming Console, Xbox One or PlayStation 4.’

After several thousand votes, the thread, posted by user DannyonPC, succeeded and a picture of the potato appeared in the news search results for ‘Gaming Console’.

The prank emerged from a Reddit sub-channel called subreddit r/circlejerk, where users constantly try to exploit the power of the site to fool Google.

One user has tried to prompt a picture of a Klu Klux Klan member to appear on search results for Justin Bieber while another is trying to make a picture of Barack Obama appear when users search for Nelson Mandela.

However, Reddit doesn’t have a monopoly on Google pranks, as searchenginepeople.com pointed out. 

It reported that in 2010, two Norwegians from Bergen, having been tipped off that the Google Street View car was nearby, dressed up scuba gear and sat in the street.

The search engine’s car duly went past and the hilarious result appeared on the internet later.

And back in 2006 pranksters duped Google into producing a picture of former US president George W Bush if you searched for ‘miserable failure’.

This prank became known as a ‘Google bomb’, a loophole that Google’s algorithm experts eventually closed.
