Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned some areas were 'swamped' by migrants

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon provoked a furious row yesterday after warning that communities were being ‘swamped’ by European immigrants.

Last night he was reprimanded by No 10 for his use of the word and rival politicians lined up to criticise what they called his ‘excessive language’.

Tory backbenchers, however, said it was appalling that a minister had been told to retract comments when all he had done was speak out frankly on immigration.

During a TV interview, Mr Fallon said some towns were ‘under siege’ from ‘huge numbers’ of migrants and that action was needed to tackle free movement rules. 

He spoke of trying to ‘prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers’. 

He was responding to a question about German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s declaration that she would not back the UK’s bid to change the rules – a major blow to David Cameron. 

But his use of the word ‘swamped’ in relation to immigration and asylum – which has long been toxic in British politics, provoked fierce criticism.

Even Ukip’s immigration spokesman branded his words ‘excessive’. Last night a government source said Mr Fallon had admitted he had made a mistake, and should have used the less emotive term ‘under pressure’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the fact Mr Fallon had used such language showed how ‘panicked’ the Conservatives were over their failure to control migration and the threat posed by his party at next month’s Rochester and Strood by-election.

In an embarrassing mark of Coalition disarray, another Cabinet minister said Britain actually needed EU migrants to fill unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector in the very same areas Mr Fallon was referring to.

Asked if she agreed that migrants were needed, Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘I accept we do, yes.’

‘I’m an MP in Norfolk, and there is an element of migrant work force, that’s very true,’ she said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is meant to be one of Mr Cameron’s key supporters in the EU reform drive, delivered a major blow when she said she would not support his demands for radical changes to the central EU tenet of free movement of workers. 

The Prime Minister has promised that clawing back control over immigration will be a ‘red line issue’ in renegotiating UK membership terms, ahead of a mooted in-out referendum if he is still in power in 2017.

But Mrs Merkel told the Sunday Times: ‘Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU.’

The row flared as Mr Cameron prepared to face MPs today on the EU’s shock demand for an extra £1.7billion.

Politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word ‘swamped’ when talking about immigration.

In 2002, David Blunkett refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were ‘swamping’ some British schools.

The then Labour Home Secretary made his remarks while defending the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill.

The Campaign for Racial Equality said they were ‘hugely emotive’.

In 1978, Margaret Thatcher said people feared being ‘swamped’ by immigration from the new Commonwealth and Pakistan.

On the prospect of four million immigrants, she said: ‘Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.’

Speaking on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News, Mr Fallon said that despite Mrs Merkel’s comments, all was not lost – because negotiations had not even started yet.

‘The Germans haven’t seen our proposal yet, and we haven’t seen our proposal yet,’ he said. 

‘That is still being worked on at the moment to see what we can do to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers.

‘In some areas, particularly on the east coast, yes, towns do feel under siege from large numbers of migrant workers and people claiming benefits. It is quite right that we look at that.’

Politicians from all sides lined up to criticise his language. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said politicians needed to be responsible in the words they used when discussing the issue.

Labour’s Europe spokesman Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: ‘That’s certainly not language I would use.’

Steven Woolfe, Ukip’s immigration spokesman, said: ‘Can you imagine what would have been said if we had said that?’

Later in the day, the Government put out a statement saying: ‘He accepts he should have chosen his words better. He should have said “under pressure”.’

But the slap-down attracted criticism from Tory backbenchers last night.

Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: ‘What the Old Etonian praetorian guard around the Prime Minister have done shows how out of touch they are, and how in touch Michael Fallon is.

‘Margaret Thatcher used the word “swamped”, and she was in touch with public opinion. Michael Fallon was speaking up for millions up and down the country.’

Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Number 10 and Mr Fallon are saying the same thing, but he is reflecting more the words you hear on the doorstep.’ 

Ukip targets 100 seats

Ukip will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support, the party’s biggest donor has revealed.

Businessman Paul Sykes said the anti-EU party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be ‘seen from the Moon’.

Mr Sykes, who will give another £1.5 million to help step up the drive, said Ukip will be raising ‘significant further funds’ as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified. 

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is hopeful of winning 100 seats in the May general election, a donor revealed 

He told the Sunday Times: ‘Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don’t have enough adverts.’

Research by Opinium for the Observer yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote Ukip if they thought it could win in their area.

Former Home Office minister Damian Green warned that it would be a ‘complete disaster’ if the Tories became ‘Ukip-lite’, urging the Conservatives to ‘calm down’.
