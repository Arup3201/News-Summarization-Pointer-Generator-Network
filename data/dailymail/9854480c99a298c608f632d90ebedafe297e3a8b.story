German special forces in Afghanistan have seized a top Taliban commander who controlled a network of suicide bombers and fighters who preyed on Nato petrol supply lines.

Mullah Abdul Rahman and another Taliban commander were 
seized by officers of the elite KSK unit who were dropped in by helicopter near the village of
Ghunday Kalay in Kunduz Province, northern Afganistan.

Rahaman, who is described as a major figure in the uprising against Nato forces in the region, was found with a Joint Prioritized Effects List (JPEL) which is a classified Nato document detailing Taliban operatives it wants captured.

His name was among those on the list.

It was Rahman's fighters who in September 2009 hijacked two fuel tankers and hid them down a dry riverbed.

US fighter jets were called in by the Germans and around 100 civilians were killed when the tankers were hit with rockets.

Sources
said he was always a major bombmaker and ordered suicide bombers to 
disguise themselves as women in blue burkas to avoid security checks.

News
media in Germany said there were unconfirmed reports from intelligence 
sources that Rahman had grown disillusioned with the Taliban and was 
seeking to switch his allegiance to the Karzai government.

Kunduz province police spokesman Sayed Sarwar Husseini. said: 'Rahman was involved in heightening insecurity in Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan provinces.

'He encouraged insurgents to plant roadside bombs and stage high-profile attacks on Afghan officials.'

Husseini said Rahman, whom Nato has described as a 'Taliban financier' in the north, was captured in Kunduz's Char Darah district last Friday.

A spokesman for NATO's Afghan force said it could not immediately comment.

Germany is the third-largest troop contributor to Afghanistan's NATO-led force.

With violence intensifying 11 years into the war, there is concern over how the 350,000-strong Afghan security forces will manage once most foreign troops leave by the end of 2014.
