A South Carolina woman who was ordered to leave a Planet Fitness gym because her pregnancy bump was showing has said the experience has left her feeling broken down.

Melissa Mantor, who is expecting her second child in September, says she felt so humiliated after being told to cover up or leave that she no longer feels able to work out in public.

Mantor, who has cancelled her membership with the West Ashley gym, said she is still waiting for a sincere apology from the manager over the way she was treated.

'Humiliated': Melissa Mantor says she was asked to leave a gym because her pregnancy bump was showing

The 31-year-old was told by a female employee on April 21 that her outfit - a tank top and leggings - violated the dress code at 
the gym.

She was 18 weeks' pregnant at the time and told Mail Online that the day she was challenged was the first day she was showing.

The owner of the franchise contacted Mantor after her initial complaint, but she said she felt he had adopted a stern tone.

The experience has left her feeling 'pretty crappy' and 'broken down to pieces,' she told ABC News.

'I don't understand how they can claim to be a "no-judgement" gym and then pick and choose who to judge,' Mantor, who has a three-year-old daughter, added.

'I
 was on the treadmill, when a female employee came up to me and said "I'm going to have to ask you to leave, you are in violation of the 
dress code".'

'She then said: ''I'm going to have to
 send you home to get changed because your belly's hanging out and I 
need to get it covered up. I told her: ''Of course my belly is hanging 
out, I am pregnant.'''

Mantor says she was wearing a top that she had worn several times at the gym, including on the day she signed up for membership there.Â 

'The only variable is that I'm now pregnant,' she said, adding that an employee told her to wear a large black T-shirt they would provide, or to leave.

Complaint: Melissa Mantor, who was 18 weeks' pregnant when she was told to cover up, wants an apology

Since the incident, which was widely publicized, several attorneys have contacted Mantor and offered to take up her case.

But the expectant mom has refused, saying all she wants is a proper apology and for the gym franchise to change its policies which have led to her and many others feeling unwelcome.

In a letter she sent to the corporate office of Planet Fitness, Mantor wrote: 'I felt humiliated when a Planet Fitness employee stopped my workout to inform me that my presence was both unwanted and unsuitable to continue.

'I feel as though Planet Fitness should sincerely apologize, not only to me, but to anyone who has become a victim of your discriminatory policy.

'You have made your members feel unwelcome and unwanted because they do not fit the vague parameters you have set on who you would like working out at your gyms.'

The stay-at-home mom added: 'I was looking for a place to go to work out, stay healthy, and feel good about myself.

'I was unable to accomplish these things because of poor application of vague and discriminatory policy.'

Policy: The Planet Fitness dress code which is posted on their corporate Facebook page

McCall Gosselin, director of public relations for the gym, said: 'Our corporate dress code policy, which is enforced at the discretion of club staff, states that jeans, boots, men's string tank tops, or revealing clothing are prohibited.

'This particular location also had a stated policy that prohibited bare midriffs. In this instance, staff informed the member of the policy and offered her a free T-shirt to complete her workout.

'She was not asked to leave the gym as a result of her attire.'

Planet Fitness's logo is 'No Gymtimidation'. The mission statement says the company provides a 'diverse, Judgement Free Zone'.

This is not the first time that Planet Fitness has faced controversy over its heavy-handed tactics on gym-goers' attire.

An Albuquerque Planet Fitness refused to let a Muslim woman wear her religious head covering while she tried to work out, according to a lawsuit filed in March.

Tarainia McDaniel, 37, recently filed the lawsuit in a New Mexico district court stemming from an October 2011 clash that prevented McDaniel from using the gym - even though court documents said another Planet Fitness had previously let her.

The lawsuit said she was turned away at the gym and was told the head covering didn't meet its dress code.

Tiffany Austin, from Richmond, California, claimed in March that a branch of Planet Fitness asked her to cover up because her toned physique was intimidating other members.
