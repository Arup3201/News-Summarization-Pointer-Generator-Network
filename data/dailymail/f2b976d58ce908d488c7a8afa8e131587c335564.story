Pony patches: A new class of pilots is choosing to wear a patch in reference to the kids show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'

A new group of Air Force pilots are comfortable enough in their masculinity to wear a 'My Little Pony' patch on their uniforms.

The patch was chosen by the 24 student pilots of class 14-05 at Vance Air Force Base - one of four centers in the U.S. where commissioned officers are trained to become professional pilots.

Their patch is an allusion to the sub-culture of 'bronies', male fans of the children's show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'.

The current show is a reboot of the 1980s cartoon and line of plastic pony toys. 

The new show has surprisingly spurned a sub-culture of male fans, and an increasing amount of these 'bronies' are members of the military.

But
according to Vance Air Force Base spokesman 1st Lieuntenant Thomas 
Barger, this class's patch was a joke and not reflective of their 
appreciation for the show.

'It was kind of a fluke,' Lt Barger told Air Force Times.

Lt
Barger explained that a student proposed the 'My Little Pilot: Flying 
is Magic' design as a joke during the slideshow presentation of patch 
options.

'That patch 
made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic
since the class never really wanted it in the first place, ' Lt Barger 
said. 'They thought it was so off the wall that it was hilarious. They 
have embraced the irony and the humor of the patch an in so doing have 
fostered closer ties with each other.'

But
the patch is far from unusual. Class patches usually contain some 
reference to current pop culture, like the game angry birds or the movie 
Austin Powers.

Past patches: Class patches are usually humorous and contain some reference to current pop culture. For example: a Pabst Blue Ribbon patch, left, and an Angry Birds patch, right

And that's exactly the point.

'We
train world-class pilots who will go on to defend out great nation. 
Fostering camaraderie, morale and unity on a regular basis and through 
small means - like a tastefully humorous patch - enhances our ability to
complete the mission when working as a team is essential,' Lt Barger told Medium.

But not all of the pilots-in-training were happy to wear the patch.

One commenter on brony site Equestria Daily, who has a son in class 14-04, witnessed a few trainees unhappy with the design. 

'There
was at least one non-brony who straight up refused to wear it and I 
overheard another complaining to his mom about it,' the commenter wrote.
'But the fight instructor (who was a captain) was wearing it and he had
no problems with his masculinity.'

These discontent pilots may be reluctant to wear a patch that connects them to the real group of military bronies.

Passion: These military men call themselves 'Bronies' as they wear patches on their uniforms identifying themselves as fans of the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic

The show's fanbase among members of the military began about two years ago when the show first began to air.

Nearly 9,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook page called 'Military Bronies.'

The page highlights various members of the military in patrol situations while wearing the My Little Pony patch.

There are variations of the patch that typically include a cloud with a red, yellow and blue lightning bolt.

'Worth protecting': The show geared toward young girls has had a fanbase among members of the military, which started about three years ago when the show first began to air

The design symbolizes a 'rainbow dash,' which is used on the show.

Administrators of the Facebook page said today that they do not advocate for servicemen to use the patches, especially if it goes against the rules of the military.

On the Facebook page, an administrator said: 'Regardless of how easy it is for others to claim this, we DO NOT promote wearing of unauthorized patches, badges or insignia on your uniform.

'We do not recommend you do ANYTHING that goes against the regulations of your branch of service.'

Together: The phenomenon came to light as men in uniform joined the 4,000 fans gathered at the 2012 BronyCon. The most recent BronyCon in Baltimore, Maryland attracted 8,000 attendees

A spokeswoman for the Pentagon told FoxNews.com that the military does not support unauthorized patches on uniforms.

One soldier, Ken 'Derpy' Catlin, defended the fanbase and its connection to the military.

He said: 'You, the bronies, have taught me that there are things and people worth protecting; things bigger and more important than myself.'

A National Guard member named Darius told Buzzfeed.com that he was amazed to see how welcoming other fans were at a brony convention.

'We barely made it up to the top steps and everyone outside was cheering for us,' he said. 'I started clapping because I figured if everyone else was clapping I’d do it too. Then my friend was like, "no dude, they’re clapping for us."'

'Cheering': Military members have said that their passion for My Little Pony has been received with great acceptance by others and has strengthened their beliefs in the military

The first BronyCon held in June 2011 and attracted only about 100 people who trickled into some 
meeting rooms in Manhattan. But the fanbase has grown exponentially and the most recent BronyCon held in Baltimore, Maryland last weekend had an attendance of about 8,000.

Ongoing: My Little Pony has been around longer than the start of its current show as Hasbro released the first toys in 1983, leading to television specials, a movie and a TV series

In 1983, Hasbro released the first My Little Pony toys, which became popular among young girls, leading to television specials, a movie and the first TV series that ran from 1986 to 1987.

The brand stuck around through the years, languishing in relative anonymity. But all that changed when Hasbro hired animator Lauren Faust, who breathed new life into the My Little Pony concept by creating the Friendship is Magic series.

Faust had worked on The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends before dreaming up the land of Equestria, where My Little Pony characters like Twilight Sparkle, Apple Jack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie get go on exciting adventures.
