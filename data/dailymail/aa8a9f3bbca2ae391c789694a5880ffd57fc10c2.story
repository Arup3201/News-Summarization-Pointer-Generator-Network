Frank Lampard is expected to be fit for a return to Stamford Bridge with his new club Manchester City despite injuring his hip in a warm weather friendly against Hamburg in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

City visit Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea for what could be a decisive top of the table clash a week on Sunday and it is set to be an emotional day for Lampard given the years of service he gave to the London club.

The 36-year-old was taken off after 20 minutes of the 2-0 win against the Bundesliga club Hamburg but manager Manuel Pellegrini later revealed the problem wasn't serious.

'He was injured in the warm up and then we took him off in the game as a precaution,' said Pellegrini.

City are due to return to Manchester on Friday, but it is unclear whether Lampard will be fit to face Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Saturday.  

City, who were playing Hamburg as part of their five-day warm-weather training camp, proved too strong for their German opponents. 

Eden Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic both scored in the second half of the game in Al Ain, which saw City field a mixture of first-team regulars, fringe players and Elite Development Squad members.
