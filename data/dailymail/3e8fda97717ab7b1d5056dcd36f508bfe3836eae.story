She's one of Britain's best dressed fifty somethings and now TV presenter Carol Vorderman is offering a chance to share her style as she auctions some of her used dresses on an upmarket clothes website.

The presenter is set to raise more than £100,000 for charity - by selling 120 of her trademark figure-hugging dresses.

The Loose Woman star has decided to have a wardrobe clear-out and give her admirers the chance to bag one of her eye-catching outfits.

Steal her style: Carol Vorderman is auctioning off her clothes, including this Roland Mouret dress she wore for her last appearance on Countdown, on a site similar to eBay for £189

She has donated 120 items of designer
 clothing to www.hardlyeverwornit.com - a second hand website where 
fashionistas can buy and sell pre-loved goods.

It is thought the collection could 
raise in excess of £100,000 and all money raised will be donated to her 
charity, the Cleft Lip and Palate Association.

Among the clothes for sale are two 
Rouland Mouret dresses, including a red one worn at the Pride of Britain
 Awards, and a pair of Agent Provocateur heeled slippers.

A Diane Von Furstenberg printed wrap 
dress, a stunning Michael Kors strapless gold evening dress - worn to to
 the Variety Club Showbiz Awards - and an Emillio Pucci purple silk 
dress with gold embroidery are also up for grabs.

The dress worn by Vorderman on her 
last episode of Countdown will also be auctioned with a starting price 
of £190, alongside many worn during her appearances on ITV's Loose 
Women.

Many of the items are instantly 
recognisable from her red carpet appearances in her role as presenter of
 Pride of Britain as well as big star-studded and glitzy events, and on 
the fashion pages of newspapers and glossy magazines.

The clothes are made by designers including Roland Mouret, Michael Kors, Vivienne Westwood, Pucci and Diane Von Furstenberg.

They are being sold in an online 
auction with starting prices ranging from £25 to £350 - but fierce 
bidding is expected to push the selling price of many items past £1,000.

The 53-year-old said: 'I've been on 
telly for so many years and obviously worn hundreds and hundreds of 
outfits as that is part of the job.

'For the last ten years I've moved 
around houses a lot and so most of the things ended up in storage 
somewhere or other and I've just had a couple of Argos canvas wardrobes 
full of my favourites crammed in.'

Vorderman, who lives in Bristol, 
chose to donate the proceeds to the Cleft Lip and Palate Association 
because her brother Anton, 60, suffers from the condition.

Charitable: Vorderman chose to donate the proceeds from the likes of these £45 Agent Provocateur slippers, to the Cleft Lip and Palate Association because her brother Anton, 60, suffers from the condition

She said: 'My brother was born with a severe form of cleft lip and palate and I've seen him suffer over the years.

'Things have improved massively since the 50s when he was born but families need support over many years.

'Offering my wardrobe to a website 
like Hardly is not only ensure that my clothes are going to a good home 
but at the same time they are raising much-needed funds for a charity, 
which I support. It's a great idea.'

Once famed for her love of 
waist-cinching dresses and towering stilettos, the former Countdown said
 her style has changed over the years.

'The reality of my life is that I 
live in Bristol and dress very casually here. We don't have paparazzi on
 the doorstep so nobody ever sees that side of me publicly which seems 
funny to all my friends and my family as that is how they know me, 
rather than the tight dresses and all the London garb.

'My life has changed again since then
 and I spend most days flying our little plane around which means I have
 to wear flat shoes which are essential for safety when your feet are on
 the rudder pedals and trousers.

'I fly a plane with a central control
 column or joystick and believe me, you can't wear a dress with that 
between your legs so it's trousers or shorts all the way for now. '

The items will be sold on 
www.hardlyeverwornit.com, a site similar to eBay which encourages users 
to bid for clothing, with the highest price winning the item.

Change of style: Carol, who was once famed for her love of figure-hugging dresses, say that now she's a pilot, she doesn't need them anymore
