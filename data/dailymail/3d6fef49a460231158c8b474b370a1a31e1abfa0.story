Courtney Robertson accepted her now ex-fiancé Ben Flajnik’s final rose and his marriage proposal on Season 16 of The Bachelor and famously had a quickie after she lured the wine-maker into the sea in Puerto Rico for a bit of skinny-dipping.

But in her new book the reality star is dishing the dirt on a few of her other famous flings.

'You meet a lot of interesting people living in Los Angeles,’ Courtney tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview, adding that fans won’t be disappointed with I Didn’t Come Here to Make Friends: Confessions of a Reality Show Villain, ‘a juicy read’ that’s ‘full of spicy moments.’

Dirty Girl: The Bachelor star Courtney Robertson doesn't hold back in her new book I Didn't Come Here to Make Friends

‘I guess I could have been a little less graphic in parts, but that's just not my nature,’ Courtney, 30, explains of how she detailed her racy romances with several well-known Hollywood hotties.

One of those candid confessions involves Entourage actor Adrian Grenier, who Courtney calls ‘sweet but non-committal.’

And she confesses that he was quite a huge catch.

‘He had the biggest penis I’d ever seen,’ Courtney writes.

The two never quite got their relationship off the ground, but that didn’t stop Adrian from sexting Courtney for years.

While Adrian didn’t make the cut, Jesse Metcalfe swept Courtney off her feet. She even calls the Dallas star one of the loves of her life.

Courtney, a successful model, reveals she first met Jesse in 2004 when he spotted her while driving his black Escalade around L.A. He immediately slammed on the brakes, got out of the vehicle and ran over and begged for her number.

Once the two connected the chemistry was red-hot. Unfortunately, notes Courtney, ‘Jesse was exciting and passionate but a total mess.’

He was also a big cheater.

‘As much as I liked Jesse, I never felt like I could trust him,’ writes Courtney, noting that ‘I can count on three hands the guys I’ve slept with — and I’ve never cheated on anyone.’

That point was driven home one night when she slept over at Jesse’s house and discovered another woman’s trashy pink lace panties in his bed.

But the couple’s intense relationship finally came to a close when Jesse told Courtney he was going to Palm Springs for a little getaway. She discovered his big lie after paparazzi photos were splashed all over TMZ.com of Jesse straddling and making out with a busty blonde in Venice Beach.

Always on the lookout for true love, the former Bachelor star agreed to go out with CAA agent Jim Toth when a mutual model friend insisted they meet. Though Courtney says Reese Witherspoon’s now husband was ‘down-to-earth’ on their date, at 13 years her senior Jim was looking to start a family and just ‘too old for me at the time.’

Courtney has become a pursued object of attraction for a long list of Hollywood lotharios including 300 hunk Gerard Butler.

Regarding 'Gerry' Butler, Courtney said: 'He texted me in the middle of the day. I realized I'd be giving up (a modeling fee worth $20k) to spend a few hours with a horny movie star. I went to work.'

Courtney's honest nature means she is extremely open in her book about everything from The Bachelor behind-the-scenes secrets (the show tests for STD's) to what really happened with her engagement to Ben — much to his chagrin.

No holding back: Besides spilling the beans on some of her successful - and not so successful - Hollywood encounters, Courtney talks behind the scenes of The Bachelor in her new book

'He sent me an email after reading the 
book,' Courtney reveals to MailOnline. 'He's disappointed in my decision
 to make these things public about our engagement.’

But he might want to rethink his stance. Though she had no problem writing about how she and Ben ‘did have sex in the ocean. On-camera,’ while filming The Bachelor in Puerto Rico, Courtney says she left out a few choice anecdotes about her former fiancé and some of the other people who have been in her life.

‘There were plenty of stories that weren't mine to share,’ she tells MailOnline. ‘And I didn't want to hurt anyone. If it pertained to my story to find love it made the cut.’

Now Courtney believes her ongoing quest for the perfect partner has taught her a valuable lesson. ‘Sometimes in life you have to take chances,’ she says. ‘I took a big swing at love and struck out.’

Though she’s nervous about the chance she took on laying bare her experiences, “putting your entire life story out there makes you feel pretty vulnerable,’ she says —she promises fans and foes it is a fun and entertaining beach read.

Worst case scenario? ‘If you hate it you can fan yourself with it,’ laughs Courtney.
