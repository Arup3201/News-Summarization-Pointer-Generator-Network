A teenager has died from drowning, and two others were rescued, after 'getting into difficulty' swimming in a park river near a lake.

West Midlands ambulance service received a call saying three young boys were experiencing trouble at Arrow Valley Country Park lake in Redditch, Worcestershire.

While the other two teenagers were treated and released on the scene, 15-year-old Richard Fellows, a schoolboy from Brockhill, eventually died in Redditch's Alexandra Hospital.

Arrow Valley Country Park lake, near where the young boys were swimming in the lake, before they found themselves in difficulty and the ambulance, fire and police services were called

The three boys appeared to have been swimming in the River Arrow, in the area of the 900 acre country park, before the incident.

A combined response unit of police, fire and ambulance services, including a Midlands Air Ambulance chopper, fled to the scene after they received the call at around 12.20pm.

The authorities also sent the ambulance service's hazardous area response team.

The hazardous area response team began searching for the third youngster at the lake as soon as they arrived.

Wearing wet suits, they joined other emergency services in a two-hour search of the lake's waters.

The
 teenager was eventually located and brought ashore where medics started
 resuscitation and advance life support, according to the ambulance 
service spokesman.

Fellows was taken to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch after being rescued from the lake, and shortly died after resuscitation attempts were made

An ambulance with a doctor on board then took the boy to Redditch's Alexandra Hospital, which had been pre-alerted to the casualty's serious condition.

A force spokesman said: 'Police, fire and the ambulance service were called to the River Arrow at just before 12.30pm following reports of a boy in difficulties in the water.

'The boy had been swimming with friends.

'Police officers entered the water and searched for some time together with specialist fire officers, who recovered the boy.

'Immediate medical attention was administered and later at the hospital, but despite best efforts the boy was pronounced dead later that afternoon.'

A WMAS spokesman said: 'It is understood that the patient was later confirmed deceased at the hospital.'

The 2.5 mile-wide country park features walkways and a play area and is a popular attraction with families and youngsters with the large 29-acre man-made Arrow Valley Lake at its centre.

Superintendent Kevin Purcell of the local police said: 'Our thoughts are with the family after this tragic incident.

'We would like to pass on a request from the family to respect their privacy.'

The two other boys rescued were treated for minor injuries by hospital staff at the scene.

A
 West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS) spokesman said: 'Two teenage 
boys were recovered from the water and treated for minor injuries by 
ambulance staff.

'They were later discharged to the care of parents at the scene.'

Tributes have already started being posted on social media sites, such as Twitter.

One read '15 is such a cruel age to be taken from his family', while another said: 'My sincerest condolences to Richard Fellow's family, he will be sorely missed #sleeptight.'

Another tribute read: 'You never know when your gonna die your life can be taken from you at any moment, sad to think that it's that easy, RIP Richard Fellows.'
