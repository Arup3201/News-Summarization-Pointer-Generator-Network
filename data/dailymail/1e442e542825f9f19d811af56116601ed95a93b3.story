The search for missing Queenslander Peter Maynard continues on the island of Nusa Lembongan off the coast off Bali.

Mr Maynard has been missing for 11 days but his family has not given up hope. The search party grew on Saturday with more surfers, expats and family joining in.

His wife, Kylie flew to Bali with Mr Maynard's brother John and other relatives on Thursday.

The search continues for 46-year-old Queensland man Peter Maynard who was last seen on August 27 off the coast of Nusa Lembongan island

The father of three was last seen having breakfast by hotel staff at the Nusa Indah Bungalow on August 27.

It was only when he failed to check out the next day that alarm bells started ringing.

Hotel staff found his possessions intact and his wallet by the bathroom sink.

The Maynard family is considering hiring a helicopter to get an aerial view of the area.

It is believed Mr Maynard may have gone out for a surf before going missing as one of his three surfboards was missing.

Police say the conditions that day were relatively calm while local surfers contradict this.

The case has baffled police, who believe if Mr Maynard did go missing in the surf, they would have found his board by now.

Nusa Penida police chief Nyoman Suarsika told Nine News that private boat owners and fishermen are helping, with all told to look out for a surfboard or a person who looks lost.

'The result is still zero,' he said.

Friends of Mr Maynard and his family are appealing to anyone who was in the Nusa Lembongan area and might have seen him to come forward.

'He was wearing a bright blue surf vest or rashie and dark-coloured board shorts and his surfboard is white, a Hammo brand,' his brother John Maynard said.

'We will continue to work with local police, the Australian consulate and surf and rescue authorities in the hope that together we can find Peter and bring this matter to an end.'

His friends Nicholas and Katrina Thorpe are also appealing via the Facebook page Bali Expat for anyone who might have seen him or know of his whereabouts to contact them.

'If they visited Nusa Lembongan Island around the same time Peter did if they could go through photos and have a think about who they saw,' Mr Thorpe told ABC News.
