Manchester City’s attempts to sign Monaco striker Radamel Falcao looked in tatters on Saturday night when the player all but confirmed his move to Real Madrid.

Manuel Pellegrini saw City’s vast array of attacking talent - including Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic - comfortably stifled by a resolute Stoke on an afternoon that will have him worried.

Falcao is available on loan from Monaco, but both City and Arsenal baulked at the asking price of £20million for the season.

Pellegrini, however, would not rule out a move for Falcao when asked after the defeat.

‘We have another 48 hours,’ he said. ‘We will see what happens. We have a very important restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the amount of players we can use. It’s not easy.’

Difficulties arise with the Financial Fair Play restrictions slapped upon City; they were fined £49m in June for breaching UEFA rules and have to be mindful of the regulations this season. Falcao’s wages of around £200,000-a-week would see the overall package Monaco are asking for reach £30m. 

Pellegrini was ready to sanction a deal for Falcao, but the striker yesterday tweeted news of his move to the Champions League holders — including the words ‘It’s a dream come true’ — before deleting his post shortly after.

Falcao has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs including Arsenal and Liverpool, although both were told that Real Madrid would be his likely destination after making enquiries earlier this month.
