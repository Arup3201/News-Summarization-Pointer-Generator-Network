Charged: Bethan Tichborne is accused of resisting a constable and using threatening words or behaviour

A woman has been charged after allegedly trying to leap over crowd control barriers as David Cameron switched on Christmas lights.

The Prime Minister was in his constituency of Witney, Oxfordshire, last night, when she is alleged to have used threatening words or behaviour.

Bethan Tichborne, 28, from Oxford, was charged with two offences over the alleged incident which happened at about 7pm.

Mr Cameron was on a stage with Father Christmas last night as he turned on the town's festive lights.

Oxford University graduate Tichborne will appear before magistrates on December 19.

She
was charged with obstructing or resisting a constable in the execution 
of their duty and another of using threatening words or behaviour to 
cause harassment, alarm or distress.

Following
the switch-on, Mr Cameron posted a picture of himself and Father 
Christmas lighting up the town.

Alongside was posted the message: 'Good to see so 
many people at the turning on of the Christmas lights in my constituency
tonight'.

It is understood Tichborne is a promising poet and has been shortlisted for prestigious literary award.
