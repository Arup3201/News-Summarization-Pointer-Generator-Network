Camping holidays are always weather-dependent, but one wacky hostel has tried to eradicate this issue -- moving its campervans indoors.

The BaseCamp Hostel, in Bonn, Germany, became the world’s first camping trailer and Pullman coach hostel when it opened in August this year.

Based in a former storage facility, the hostel features 15 varieties of vintage camping caravans, two former railway Pullman coached and four U.S. Airstream trailers - all with shared washrooms.

The wacky hostel has taken glamping to a new level - by moving its uniquely themed camper vans inside

Fur better or worse: This lot features a caravan with animal skins and antlers

Designed by film and TV outfitter 
Marion Seul, each campervan is uniquely-themed, with the vintage 
vehicles likely to tickle nostalgia in anyone who visits.

The
 names of the caravans are also pretty apt. There are the likes the 
Hunting Room, which is in the style of a shooting box; 'Rockabilly, 
which is plastered with vintage records and Nautilis, which is based 
around Jules Vernes’ novel 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.

There are also the more obvious Safari and House Boat, which give visitors exactly what they would expect.

In total, there are 120 beds in the 1600-square meter indoor complex. Prices range from 22 Euros to 69 Euros a night.

Motor home: This caravan will no doubt be popular with petrolheads

Bright idea: You'll need your sunglasses for a stay in this caravan
