Eighteen people were injured last night in a train collision after an Amtrak service went into a stationary train after reportedly going through a red light.

One locomotive of a train with eight passengers ran head-on at 15 to 20mph into a stationary train carrying 137 passengers in Oakland, California.

Passengers and crew suffered minor injuries and one person was taken to hospital, but none of the injuries were life-threatening, Amtrak said.

Some of the injured were deliberately 
immobilised by emergency medical staff as a precaution in case of spinal
injuries, officials said.

One person suffered a broken arm and 
up to 45 emergency staff responded to the accident, Oakland fire 
chief Emon Usher said.

A Coast Starlight train was headed 
from Los Angeles to Seattle and had made a scheduled stop in Oakland at 
the time of the accident.

The San Joaquin was en route from Bakersfield to Oakland when it went through the red light, Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole said.

Emergency response: The crash is thought to have happened after one of 
the trains traveled through a red signal close to Oakland station

One of the trains was derailed by the 
crash, which saw the Starlight service run into the stationary San 
Joaquin train which was boarding.

All services into and out of the Jack London Amtrak station in Oakland were suspended following the  ‘slow-speed’ crash, Mr Cole added.

Alton Smith, a passenger on one of the trains, told television station KTVU that he felt 'an awful jolt' from the impact.

Miesha Anderson, told CBS5 that she 
heard 'a big bang like, a bomb'. She told the station that she thought a
forklift had hit the train. 'We didn't even think that another train had hit the train,' she said.

Explanation: Stranded Amtrak passengers gather after two trains collided. A fire official said one train was unloading passengers when the second train ran into it at an estimated speed of 15 to 20mph

About 50 passengers were inside the 
train terminal around two hours after the crash, talking to Amtrak 
officials while the trains were inspected.

The crash is the second significant 
incident in two weeks in the San Francisco East Bay area where there 
were injuries to Amtrak passengers.

On September 30, 37 passengers and two
crew members suffered minor to moderate injuries when an Amtrak 
passenger train collided with a truck.

It happened at a crossing near 
Brentwood where there were no lights or gates. The driver of the 
truck and a passenger inside were not hurt.
