Also: Southampton face meltdown as the mastermind behind their resurrection prepares to quit.

Arsene Wenger is trying to do a £35million deal for German whiz-kid Julian Draxler - to turn him into the next Robin van Persie.

Also: Hull City owner Assem Allam has threatened to walk out on the Tigers within 24 hours if the FA rejects his proposed change to the club's name.

Assem Allam, the Hull City chairman, has threatened to walk out on the club if his controversial attempt to rename them 'Hull Tigers' is blocked by the Football Association or the supporters.

Also: The Americans were busy with their calculators working out the temperatures in their favoured Fahrenheit while our cousins here in Australia use the Celsius scale, but there was unanimity yesterday that it was a bit of a stinker.

Andy Murray said he feared someone could suffer a heart attack if Australian Open organisers insist on play going ahead in 42C temperatures in Melbourne, as they did yesterday.

Also: Barcelona have admitted a company owned by Neymar's parents received more than 70 per cent of the near £50million transfer fee that brought the player to the Nou Camp.

Everton are hopeful of ending the uncertainty of Leighton Baines' future, and with it David Moyes' interest in a reunion with the left-back at Manchester United, by securing the England international on a new long-term contract.

Also: The Hull City owner, Assem Allam, has threatened to walk away from the club if the Football Association refuses to grant his application to change the club's name to Hull Tigers.

Manchester United's former prodigy Paul Pogba feels such a deep grievance about the way he was treated by Sir Alex Ferguson that he has ruled out any notion of returning to Old Trafford, to provide the midfield quality which manager David Moyes is lacking.

Also: Andy Murray emerged unscathed after playing through the hottest part of a scorching day here at the Australian Open yesterday but believes tournament organisers should reconsider the rules about playing in extreme heat.

David Moyes is set for more transfer embarrassment with Paul Pogba ready to snub an amazing £40m return to Manchester United.

Also: Newcastle star Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has apologised to Samir Nasri for almost kicking him out of the World Cup.

Manuel Pellegrini says Sergio Aguero's return will only strengthen Manchester City's bid to pull off football's mission impossible - an unprecedented 'Quadruple'.
