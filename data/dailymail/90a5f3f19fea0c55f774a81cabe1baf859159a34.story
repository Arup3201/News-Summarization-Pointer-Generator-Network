The 'Dream Home' built by novelist John Irving has gone on the market for $3million.

The 72-year-old, who achieved international acclaim for The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules, designed the Dorset, Vermont, mansion with his wife Janet.

Their aim was to create a property that was both a work space and a retreat. The couple finished building it in 1989, and 25 years on, they are selling up.

Novelist John Irving is selling his 8,300 square-foot five-bedroom home in Dorset, Vermont, for $3million 

The luxury mansion, which sits on 11.53 acres, has a swimming pool and stunning views across the hills

The 8,300-square-foot estate, being sold through Sothebys, offers five large bedrooms, six bathrooms and most importantly for the award-winning author 'the ability to get up in the morning and simply go to work where you live'.

It also has a gym with a full-sized wrestling court, allowing Mr Irving to practice his beloved sport, all spread across across nearly 12 acres of private land equipped with tennis courts and a pool. 

There is also a large office where Mr Irving would spend up to nine hours a day writing. He would have to wear a hat and sunglasses while at his desk because so much light is let in. 

A large shower, bathroom and private sauna complete the first floor. 

The master bedroom offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room 

The writer holds up his Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay with The Cider House Rules in 2000. After 25 years living in the Vermont house with his wife, he has decided to move to an apartment in Toronto

Mr Irving, who achieved critical acclaim for his novels including The World According to Garp and Cider House Rules, said he wanted to create a home which could be both a retreat and a place of work 

One of the reasons he chose the location was because of the spectacular views of the Green Mountains

The property has a gym which includes a range of equipment including rowing machines and exercise bikes 

'It's not only the house that I've been in the longest,' says the writer, 'but I have to say, it's been a very happy period in my life that I've been living here.'

According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Irving fitted the home with furniture she said wasn't 'precious' and could be used by the family.

Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of The World According to Garp in 1978. The Cider House Rules (1985), which was later turned into a film starring Michael Caine, and A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), have also been bestsellers.

The room also has a full-sized wrestling court. Photos show Irving playing the sport as he grew up. He was a wrestling coach as well as a wrestler in high school and college 

In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

He is now said to be finishing his 14th novel, Avenue of Mysteries, about an older Mexican-American man who travels to the Philippines and reflects on his childhood in Mexico.

The couple are now moving to their apartment in Toronto. Mr Irving's main concern, according to the Journal, is that he won't have enough room for the hundreds of family photos he has of his family.

Potential petrol-headed residents will be able to fit three cars in this enormous garage that sits at the back of the sprawling property 

Around the side of the house is a stone terrace which also offers spectacular views of the surrounding area 

The master suite offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room

The dining room, which has easy access to the wet bar and kitchen, is perfect for entertaining guests 

Ms Irving is said to have fitted the home with furniture she did not consider to be 'precious' so it could be used by all members of the family 

Following a day of working or walking in the surroundings, the new owners can sit in front of the television or simply stare out into the surrounding gardens 

A breakfast bar separates the dining table and the kitchen. Book shelves cover the walls around the house 

After a long day of writing, Mr Irving enjoys to cook in this spacious kitchen. A mock street sign with his name above hangs on the wall 

A piano sits in one of the hallways that line the front and back of the house 

If the gym and wrestling are not enough - there is also a full-size tennis court in the grounds
