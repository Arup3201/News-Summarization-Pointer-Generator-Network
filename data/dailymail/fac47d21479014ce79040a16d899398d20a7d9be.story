A Tibetan monk who co-founded the first Buddhist monastery in the UK has been killed in China.

Police in Chengdu, south-west China, say three suspects are in custody after Tarap Shetrup Akong was stabbed to death in a financial dispute.

The 73-year-old, who had lived in Britain since 1963, was killed along with his driver and nephew.

'Assassinated': Choje Akong Rinpoche, who co-founded the first Buddhist monastery in the UK, has reportedly been killed in China

Akong founded the Co-Sanye Ling monastery in a former nursing home in Eskdalemuir, Dumfries and Galloway, in 1967.

His death was announced on the monastery's website.

A statement posted last night said: 'I am very, very sorry to inform you 
all that tragically, my brother Choje Akong Rinpoche, my nephew and one 
monk who was travelling with them, were all assassinated in Trengdu 
today.

'Rinpoche's body has been taken to hospital where a post mortem will be carried out.'

Founder: Akong came to the UK in 1963 and founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West in 1967

Akong Rinpoche - who was addressed as such because of his respected status in the Tibetan Buddhist community - was born in Tibet, but fled to India in 1959 following revolution.

Although he was part of a group of 300 to leave for India, only 13 are said to have made it.

He came to Oxford in 1963 to learn English, working as an orderly in a hospital to support himself, before eventually founded the Scottish monastery - the first of its kind in the West.

Around 60 monks and lay people still live at the monastery today.

The UK Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Chengdu, China, on 8 October.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
