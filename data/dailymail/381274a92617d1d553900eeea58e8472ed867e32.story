Traffic jams are set to cost the average family more than £2,000 a year in lost time by 2030, a damning report reveals today.

The cost will rise to more than £4,000 a year for families in London – the UK’s most congested city. 

Over the next 16 years congestion will wipe more than £300billion off the UK economy, the INRIX/CEBR report concludes.

By 2030, the cost of sitting in traffic jams will be higher per person in the UK than in France, Germany or the US, the INRIX/CEBR report concludes

Traffic congestion: Population growth and a booming economy are the main factors driving the rise in traffic

Population growth – predicted to rise from 64million to 72million in 2030 and offset a fall in average car ownership levels - and a booming national economy are the main factors driving the rise in costly gridlock which will provide ‘a terrible shock’ for households.

The annual cost of jams to the nation will soar by 63 per cent from £13billion last year to more than £21billion by 2030 – a figure that exceeds entire UK transport budget for 2014, it says.

Over that same period, the predicted cost per household will increase by 44 percent – from £1,426 in 2013 to £2,057– or three times the average UK monthly rent in 2014, says the report.

It will see the time spent by the average British motorist stuck each year in gridlock annually rise from 124 hours last year to 136 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 18 working days a year.

In London, which suffers the worst congestion and delays, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013. 

This is double the UK average but is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 40 working days a year.

The UK’s 63 per cent increase will be the highest among the main world economies studies and compares to a 50 per cent rise in the USA and 31 per cent in both Germany and France.

London will be left in the Slow lane, with the sharpest fall in average speeds when in traffic congestion

2013-2030 cumulative UK cost of congestion: £307billion (18 per cent of UK GDP in 2013)

· £191billion – direct costs

· £115billion – indirect costs

2013-2030 annual UK cost of congestion increase: 63 per cent

· £13.1billion in 2013

· £21.4billion in 2030 (more than the entire UK transport budget in 2014)

2013-2030 per UK household cost of congestion increase: 44 per cent

· £1,426 in 2013

· £2,057 in 2030 (three times the average UK monthly rent in 2014)

The study from traffic experts INRIX – who supply data used in car sat-nav systems - and the Centre for Economics and Business Research based its UK findings on the UK’s 18 largest urban areas. 

These include Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford-Leeds, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent. 

It says that although households will have fewer cars on average, population growth means there will be more cars on the road in absolute terms ‘as the UK economy continues to strengthen.’

The INRIX report concludes: ‘Between 2013 and 2030, the total cumulative cost of congestion to the UK economy is estimated to be a staggering £307billion.’ 

Of that £307billion - equivalent to nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation’s productive wealth  last year - some £191billion is in the form of ‘direct costs ‘ such as the value of fuel and the time wasted by not being productive at work. 

A further £115billion is in the form of ‘indirect costs’ which relate to higher transport and freight costs and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic, which are passed on to consumers as additional costs to household bills.

The report notes that in the UK last year, almost 70 per cent of the workforce commuted to work by car during peak times, with the average British driver spending 124 hours stuck in gridlock annually. 

‘This is set to rise to 136 hours in 2030, equivalent to 18 working days a year. This has both a direct and indirect economic impact on car commuting households,' the report says.

And adds: ‘In London, the UK’s most congested city, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013, which is double the UK average. This is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030, equivalent to 40 working days a year.'

The cost of jams: Rising congestion in London is expected to cost families in the capital £4,000 each in 2030

2013-2030 cumulative London cost of congestion: £130billion

 · £68billion – direct costs

· £62billion – indirect costs

2013-2030 annual London cost of congestion Increase: 71 per cent

· £5.4billion in 2013

· £9.3billion in 2030

2013-2030 per London household cost of congestion Increase: 44 per cent

· £2,765 in 2013

· £4,002 in 2030

It says that although fewer than a third of Londoners commute to work by car, the cost of living and the value of time for the capital’s 1.4million car commuters is at such a premium that it will cost ‘each car commuting household more than £4,000 a year by 2030.’

The cost of congestion to the capital’s economy will rise by 71 per cent – from £5.4billion in 2013 to £9.3billion in 2030. The cost per London household will rise over the same period by 44 per cent – from £2,765 in 2013 to £4,002 in 2030.

As a result, the cumulative cost of congestion in London over the next 16 years will top £130billion, of which £68billion will be direct costs and £62billion indirect costs.

The INRIX/CEBR report concludes that population growth and the ‘expected strengthening of the British economy’ will lead to ‘a significant increase in the demand for road travel across the country over the next 16 years.’

It notes: ‘Population growth is the largest driver of road travel demand in the UK. UK population is predicted to grow by 12 per cent, from 64million in 2013 to 72million in 2030.'

London alone will experience a 20 per cent population increase from 8.4million to 10.1million over the period. This will place a significant strain on the capital’s road network’. 

GDP is predicted to rise by a quarter (24 per cent) by 2030: ‘As incomes increase, households are expected to choose car travel over other forms of transport, driving up congestion levels as a result.'

Car ownership levels, which last year stood at stood at 448 vehicles per 1,000 people are ‘expected to decrease slightly’ because of shifting attitudes and investment in rail.

 But the report stresses: ‘The absolute number of vehicles on the UK’s roads is still expected to be higher by 2030 as a result of continued population growth’.

The World Bank’s prediction of stable fuel prices suggests UK fuel prices will increase by only 2 per cent in real terms, from £1.34 per litre in 2013 to £1.36 in 2030, it says . Added to improvements in fuel economy, this will ‘reduce the effective cost of motoring’ and persuade more people to drive, it says.

Matt Simmons, European director of INRIX said: ‘This study is a warning of the worsening impact of gridlock on the British economy and on household budgets.

‘We now know that congestion will continue to have serious consequences for national and city economies, businesses and citizens in the years to come. If we think this problem is bad now, we are in for a terrible shock come 2030.’
