Newcastle midfielder Haris Vuckic has apologised for posting a selfie on Twitter showing him grinning as he flew to New Zealand the day after two of the club's supporters died in the Malaysian Airlines tragedy.

Fans John Adler, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, were killed while making the
 same journey on doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 to see their 
beloved Newcastle play in a pre-season tour. 

Vuckic posted a tweet, which was later deleted, showing him and 
defender Paul Dummett on board a plane, with the tag: 'New Zealand!! 
Here we come!! @PaulDummett preseason!! SleepTime'.

After
 removing the message, the 21-year-old Slovenian tweeted: 'My apologies 
if anyone was offended by my photo from the plane. No offence was 
intended. We are thinking of John and Liam. #RIP #NUFCfamily'.

Meanwhile,
 supporters of Newcastle's bitterest rivals, Sunderland, have raised 
more than Â£2,500 for a floral tribute to the two fans.

The
 aim was to raise Â£100 for flowers and a message showing how fans can 
come together in tragedy, with any surplus going to charity.
