Number one spot: The top word of 2013 is '404' - the internet code for failure, commonly seen when a webpage doesn¿t load

Following closely behind is the word 'fail,' 'hashtag, '@pontifex' (Pope Francis’ Twitter handle), and 'optic,' the new term for 'narrative.'

'404 has gained enormous attention the world over this year as systems in place since World War II, which many see as the beginning of the contemporary era, are in distress or even failure,' said Paul JJ Payack, President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor.

'The recent ObamaCare launch debacle in 
the US is only a representative example of a much wider system fail, 
from the political deadlock in the US Government, to the decline of the 
dollar, to the global web of intrigue and surveillance by the NSA, to 
the uncertainty regarding the European Union, and the on-going 
integration of China and other rising powers, such as India and Brazil 
into the global economic system.'

Other high-ranking words from the list indicate a focus on an especially difficult year in US politics: 'surveillance,' 'deficit,' 'filibuster,' 'deadlock,' and 'stalemate,' reported QZ.

'Toxic politics,' 'federal shutdown,' and 'global warming/climate change' are the top three phrases of the year. 

404  –  The near-universal numeric code for failure on the global Internet.

Fail — The single word fail, often used as a complete sentence (Fail!) to signify failure of an effort, project, or endeavor.

Hashtag  – The ‘number sign' and ‘pound sign’ reborn as the all-powerful Twitter hashtag.

@Pontifex — The Hashage of the ever-more popular Pope Franciscus (Francis).

The Optic — The ‘optic’ is threatening to overtake ‘the narrative’ as the Narrative overtook rational discourse. Does not bode well for an informed political discussion.

Surveillance — The revelation of the unprecedented extent of spying by the NSA into lives of ordinary citizens to the leaders of the closest allies of the US.

Drones  – Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that are piloted remotely or by on-board computers used for killing scores or even hundreds of those considered enemy combatants of the US.

Deficit — Looks like deficit-spending will plague Western democracies for at least the next decade.  Note to economists of all stripes:  reducing the rate of increase of deficit spending still  increases the deficit.

Sequestration – Middle English sequestren, from Old French, from Latin sequestrare, to hide away or isolate or to give up for safekeeping.

Emancipate — Grows in importance as worldwide more women and children are enslaved in various forms of involuntary servitude.
