A Canadian radio host and newspaper columnist took off her top during an interview with her local mayor this week and continued asking him questions bare-chested.

Lori Welbourne, who hosts the radio show On The Rocks and writes a column for the Province newspaper, was talking to Walter Gray, mayor of Kelowna in British Columbia, about whether it was legal in the town for women to bare their breasts in public.

'What if I went walking down the street topless?' she asked in the recorded interview.

But before Gray could answer her question, Welbourne handed him her microphone and undid the strap on her dress, exposing her breasts.

'What are you doing,' he asked, to which she replied, 'it's really hot in here.'

After regaining his composure, Gray explained that while someone may be tempted to call the police there is little authorities could do because it is in fact entirely legal for a woman to be topless anywhere a man can be.

Welbourne's stunt was in anticipation of Sunday's Go Topless Day.

Public toplessness is not illegal anywhere in Canada unless it's deemed to be indecent. It is also legal for women in a range of American states though plenty still outlaw.

'So I can go topless here in Kelowna?' Welbourne went on.

Topless: The stunt was to draw attention to Go Topless Day, which was celebrated on Sunday

'Well, evidently,' Gray said. 'I'm not suggesting you should do that but I don't think youâ€™d be committing any crime or breaking any bylaw.'

Groups of women turned out shirtless in cities including New York on August 25 to celebrate a women's right to bare her breasts in public. The annual event was started in 2007.

Welbourne went on to ask the mayor whether he was aware we are all naked under our clothes and whether he had any piercing and he replied in good humor.
