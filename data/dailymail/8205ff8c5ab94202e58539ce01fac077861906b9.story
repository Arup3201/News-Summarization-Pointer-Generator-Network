Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

This week, Mad Dog talks about the first time he ever laid eyes on Raheem Sterling, how Robin van Persie should be the man to leave Manchester United and why he believes Rickie Lambert may be picked over Andy Carroll in England's World Cup squad.

Four years ago on a cold, wet Saturday morning I stood next to David Pleat watching the QPR youth team play Brentford underneath the flight path into Heathrow.

I was there to see my son Charlie play for Brentford.

Potential: Raheem Sterling produced a stunning over-head kick when he was just 14 years old

International: He has already made his England debut and may get another opportunity this week

David told me he'd come to watch a young player and he pointed to a boy who was very small, very quick – with lightning acceleration – and very skilful.

But he looked totally uninterested and during the game had no final product.

Over the years we've all seen the super-quick boys at 14, 15 and 16 fade away. As other lads grow stronger and faster, those teenagers who used to be rapid just flitter away.

Between David and myself we commented that he just looked average and was nothing special.

At 0-0, with 10 minutes to go, David was about to leave when the boy, who was only about 14, was moved to centre forward.

New generation: Sterling and young Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are England hopefuls

Lo and behold, the QPR right back bombed down the wing and got to the byline, from where he floated a cross beyond the near post defender towards the penalty spot.

In an instant the boy changed 
direction from the edge of the six yard box, running away from goal and 
the monster Brentford centre back towards the penalty spot.

As
 the ball floated in the air the boy executed an astonishing over-head 
kick that smashed into the stanchion in the back of the net. The 
goalkeeper didn't even move an inch.

Everyone who was watching clapped, including myself and David. It was sensational.

We both looked at each other and smiled, and David took a note of the name. It was none other than Raheem Sterling.

What a shame that Liverpool beat QPR to it and signed him.

Lightning: The Liverpool winger has been a revelation since his reintroduction into the side

The
 comments on Dutch TV by Robin van Persie that his team-mates are 
getting in his way and going into his positions are typical of the Dutch
 mentality that we've seen throughout their World Cup campaigns.

We've
 seen players getting sent home for disagreeing with the manager, 
players getting sent home because they've complained they're not playing
 and players getting sent home because they're not happy with the 
bonuses.

It's a very fine line between confidence and arrogance.

Can you imagine Wayne Rooney's face when he read those comments?

Clearly
 Van Persie wants out. Aged 30 and with a poor injury record he's the 
first one who should be shown the exit door in the summer.

Quite
 clearly that type of attitude rubs off on the rest and there will be 
factions and cliques at Manchester United moaning and complaining, 
talking about how Sir Alex Ferguson used to do it this way or that way.

Anger: Robin van Persie must want to leave Manchester United after his recent comments

Beaten: Van Persie missed a simple chance to get Manchester United back into their Champions League tie

The bottom line is, several of those players are well past their best.

Going
 back two years, Sir Alex had to bring Paul Scholes, who was a 
coach at the club, back from retirement as he was short of a holding 
midfield player who could supply passes and control the tempo of the 
game.

Surely the alarm bells must've been ringing loud and clear when Scholes was in his late 30s and put back into the first team.

Strikers: Wayne Rooney can't be happy with the way the Dutchman has been so outspoken

Roy Hodgson has a dilemma.

Who does he pick as his 'big man' option as we get closer to the wonderful World Cup in Brazil? Rickie Lambert has been consistent, he's been steady and at times he has added the spectacular.

This is a man who has ploughed and furrowed his way through lower leagues, through non-leagues, and finally made his mark as a top quality target man in the Barclays Premier League.

I remember him well from just a few years ago, scoring for Bristol Rovers against my team at the time and basically putting another nail in my managerial coffin with that club.

In the goals: Rickie Lambert has scored twice for England when they have played him

He was quality that day, he oozed confidence. He is an excellent technical finisher and as an England fan I think Lambert will get the nod over Andy Carroll.

Andy undoubtedly has great qualities and Mr Hodgson would have to consider which player to choose if he were to have an impact substitute.

This is where Carroll could sneak in.

If you're 1-0 down with 20 minutes to go, I think Carroll could have a far greater impact.

When defenders are tiring at the end of a match in hot conditions the last thing they want is a battering ram hurled at them.

Roy's got a big decision to make.

Up high: Andy Carroll is less subtle in his play but brings a more physical threat

Sunday
 afternoon brought back, as it does every year, tears of sadness as I 
sat watching the teams coming out at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final.

I could only 
shake my head remembering the 1986 League Cup Final – it was called the 
Milk Cup back then – when I played for QPR against Oxford.

We were near the top of the First Division, they were near the bottom.

We'd beaten them away about three weeks before the final.

Reminiscing: Watching the Capital One Cup final brought back memories of 1986 when Oxford beat QPR

And
 in the semi-final we had beaten treble winners Liverpool over two legs,
 including a 2-2 draw away at Anfield where thankfully Jim Beglin scored
 two own goals and we didn't even have one shot.

We were odds-on favourites. We had nice suits. We had the celebrations organised for a hotel in London after the game.

It was a question of just turning up. We might as well not have done.

I
 think it's fair to say I was one of Oxford's best players; repeatedly 
giving the ball away, not making any tackles, and the whole game just 
drifted by.

I found 
myself substituted after 70 minutes and I'll never forget sitting on 
that bench feeling empty, knowing I had blown it and let the supporters 
and my family down.

They hammered us 3-0 and that experience will never leave me.

Trophy: Manchester City beat Sunderland 3-1 to claim their first silverware under Manuel Pellegrini

I was fortunate to be invited the London
 Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square on Thursday night for the annual Sparks
 fund-raising and awards dinner.

They are a charity who fund medical research for children – it is a brilliant cause.

On the night a huge £70,000 was raised, which is a fine effort.

There
 was a big charity auction with golf trips and holidays to Barbados on 
offer and some prizes going for big sums to some very wealthy people.

It was nice to do something away from football.

There was a man from Armenia called Kevin, who played the piano, sang and joked around and had everybody in fits of laughter.

He's the funniest entertainer I have ever seen. It was a wonderful evening.
