It may about to be turned into luxury apartments, but old plans uncovered in the shed of leisure entrepreneur John Broome reveal Battersea Power Station was once destined to become a Las Vegas-style indoor theme park.

The sketches, which were found by Mr Broome while clearing out his house along with his son Will, show the atrium of the power station filled with white-knuckle rollercoasters, a giant ice rink, and six storeys of shops, cinemas and cultural experiences each themed around a different continent.

Plans for The Battersea, as the attraction would have been called if it had opened in 1990 as planned, also include a giant ice rink, waterfall and an 'oceanarium' big enough to be explored by miniature submarines.

Lost Vegas: These sketches show what the inside of Battersea Power Station would have looked like if plans to turn it into an indoor theme park had gone ahead. It would have included a huge ice rink, hot air balloon rides around the atrium and six floors of shopping, cinemas and cultural experiences, each themed around a continent

Under the sea: The sketches also contain plans for a giant 'oceanarium' which visitors could have explored using miniature submarines (pictured). Other attractions would have included a pleasure-park on the Thames, indoor rollercoasters, and a bullet train to Victoria station which would have carried visitors back and forth in three minutes

Beauty: The site would also have included a landscaped front entrance. However plans fell through after the cost of removing asbestos from the building spiralled, bringing the total estimated budget from £35million to more than £200million

Visitors would have been able to jump on a high-speed bullet train from Victoria which would have taken them to the complex in three minutes, then explored a pleasure-park by the Thames, browsed in an upmarket shopping mall, before finally jumping in a hot-air balloon for a ride around the enormous interior atrium.

Mr Broome bought the site for just £1.5million, but his plans came unstuck when the cost of removing asbestos from the brickwork spiralled, bringing the total construction bill from an estimated £35million to £200million.

Mr Broome was forced to sell off the station, and his company Battersea Leisure stopped trading. It is thought he lost tens of millions in the process.

Iconic: The huge Battersea facility has been a feature of the London sky-line since it began operating in 1933, and has been given Grade II* listed status

Modern: New plans for the power station include luxury properties, a new tube station, a shopping mall, cinema complex, restaurants and outdoor gardens

Construction: While the estimated 250 new flats are built, the power station's iconic towers will have to be removed and then rebuilt because they are currently in danger of collapsing

Speaking to the London Evening Standard, Will Broome refuted allegations his father had 'vandalised' the structure after allowing the roof and some machinery to be removed, and said he should be thanked for laying the groundwork for the building's current renovation.

Plans by the current owners, a consortium of businesses from Malaysia, include luxury apartments, a new tube station, a cinema and shopping mall.

Home: Despite Mr Broome once being told Battersea would never become a residential development, new flats have gone on sale starting at £800,000 for a single-bed, £2.7million for a three-bedroom and £4million for a four-bed residence

Desirable: A total of 3,500 new homes will be right new to the new shopping mall and cinema complex, with the redevelopment expected to create 15,000 new jobs

1926: The site of a super-station at Battersea is first mooted, with its proposed location causing a storm of protest. Plans are approved by Electricity Commissioners the following year.

1930: Battersea A, the first of the two adjacent power stations begins to take shape. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott is appointed and tasked with connecting Battersea Power Station’s architectural features. The steel frame is enveloped in a brick skin and the chimneys pre-cast in concrete. Distinctive fluting is designed for the brick cladding and chimney bases.

1933: The first two 69MW generating units in Battersea A begin operating. Two years later, a further 105MW generating set completes Battersea A. Design and presentation throughout the finished building reflects its eminent position in the industry.

1937: Construction begins on Battersea B. With war imminent, brick and concrete covers are constructed for the turbo– alternators and shelters built over existing glass.

1939: Construction of Battersea B continues throughout World War II. A survey by Architectural Magazine finds that the power station is the second most popular modern building in the country.

1944: Battersea B comes into service.

Old: Plans for a power station at Battersea were first submitted in 1926, with the first power produced in 1933. While the four chimnies are now iconic, the station only had three until 1955

1953: With the last 100MW set commissioned the overall capacity is 509MW. Battersea generates a fifth of London’s power, with 28 stations taking care of the rest. It has a higher thermal efficiency than any other power station.

1955: The fourth and final chimney is completed, making the power station the largest brick building in Europe.

1975: Battersea A ceases generation after 42 years.

1976: Pink Floyd suspends an inflatable pink pig between The Power Station’s chimneys, for its ‘Animals’ album cover. Chaos ensues when the pig breaks free and flies into a Heathrow flight path.

1980: In recognition of its Art Deco splendour, the Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine lists Battersea Power Station as a building of special architectural and historical interest.

1982: Battersea B ceases operations.

1984: Battersea Leisure wins a development competition run by The Department of Environment and The Central Electricity Generating Board with plans for a leisure and entertainment complex.

1987: John Broome purchases the site.

1989: With initial demolition complete, including removal of the Boiler House roof and west wall, funding runs out and Battersea Leisure ceases trading.

1993: Hong Kong-based consortium Parkview International buys the site and embarks on a series of schemes and planning applications.

2006: Real Estate Opportunities (REO) plc, majority-owned by Irish developer Treasury Holdings, purchases the site and appoints Rafael Viñoly’s practice to devise a new master plan.

2010: The London Borough of Wandsworth grants planning for a development of 7.9m sq ft – one of the largest planning consents granted in central London.

2010: Following the collapse of the Irish real estate market, the Irish agency NAMA and Lloyds TSB foreclose on REO loans and administrators Ernst & Young (E&Y) are appointed.

2012: In June, it is announced that SP Setia and Sime Darby have entered into an exclusive agreement with Ernst & Young, NAMA and LloydsTSB to purchase Battersea Power Station. Wandsworth Council greets the announcement by stating that the deal is 'very good news.' In September the purchase is completed.

2013: Battersea Power Station launches its public sales.
