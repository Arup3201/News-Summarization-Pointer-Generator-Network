A leading Tory MP has voiced his anger as a crushed commuter on Britain’s ‘Sardine Express.’

He said rail company South West Trains was treating its customers like ‘a cash cow’ while forcing them to endure misery in overcrowded conditions that would provoke prosecutions if livestock were treated so badly. 

Rising star Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab said that like many of his constituents, he had the misfortune to be crammed into the most overcrowded commuter train in Britain – the 7.32am South West trains service from Woking to Waterloo.

Tory MP Dominic Raab spoke out about the overcrowded commuting conditions on South West Trains

During the debate in Westminster Hall, Raab pointed out that conditions were 'one grade below cattle class'

He told Transport Minister Claire Perry: ‘It’s little wonder the Daily Mail dubbed the service the Sardine Express.’ 

Speaking during a debate which he instigated in the Commons’ Westminster Hall he noted: ‘EU rules stipulate that calves, adult goats and unshorn sheep must be transported by train in an area of space of at least 0.3 metres squared per unit of livestock.

‘Yet, the new government standard for commissioning commuter services for humans is now 0.25 metres squared, significantly less. 

‘I understand that the only train company currently operating to that standard is - you guessed it - South West Trains’.

He said he and his overcrowded constituents were paying soaring fares and massive subsidies to improve other rail services across the UK ‘for the privilege of travelling at one grade below cattle class on South West Trains’.

South West Trains customers ‘feel quite literally as if they are treated like a cash cow, despite travelling in sub-cattle class conditions,’ he said.

But while his words of woe will resonate with millions of commuters the length and breadth of Britain, they are likely to be met with dismay by Transport ministers.

Waterloo Station is the final stop for Britain's most overcrowded commuter train: the Woking to Waterloo route

Mr Raab, a judo black belt who boards at Esher station in Surrey said: ‘I know first-hand how packed the carriages are. Occasionally, it’s impossible even to get on the train.’ 

He said the service had become even worse since last year: ‘I say this not just from the clear data available, but also as a commuting MP.' 

He said: ‘I stand on the platform with my constituent paying an ever-increasing fare both for the train service and the parking at the station. 

‘And together we have experienced the steadily increasing overcrowding of a prime commuter route.’ 

Mr Raab said he was ‘not surprised’ to learn that 2013 data from the Department for Transport had pinpointed his regular service – the 7.32am train from Woking to Waterloo train – as having ‘the largest number of passengers in excess of capacity’, rail industry jargon for ‘most overcrowded.’ 

He said: ‘By the time it arrives at Esher at 7.52am, it’s packed to the gunnels.’ 

Official data showed it has 540 passengers over its specified maximum capacity limit – or 73 per cent over its official capacity ceiling. 

Raab opened up discussion about the high fares and poor service that his constituents must endure

He noted: ‘The 7.32 has consistently appeared in the top 10 overcrowded peak services in recent years. Nor is it a freak time … for example, the 7.02am service is almost as packed.‘ 

He said Surrey commuters were particularly hard-hit with high fares and poor service. In his own Elmbridge borough alone - dubbed the ‘Beverley Hills of Britain for the high concentation of celebrities and premiership football players - nearly 12 million people using the stations. 

Recorded journeys have almost doubled between 2002 and 2010.

A season ticket for the 25 minute journey from Esher to Waterloo currently costs just under £2,000, he said, noting: ‘Fares will rise by 3% again in the New Year.’ 

Surreys ‘sardine’ commuters are also subsiding services elsewhere, contributing £6billion to the Treasury but getting back less than £1billion in services. 

In 2013/14, South West Trains passengers paid Department of Transport the highest premium for their rail service - 5.2 pence per passenger per kilometre. 

By contrast some 13.1 pence subsidy ‘doled out’ by the government to Arriva Trains Wales, while London Midland received 2.8p and South Eastern 2.2p. 

In the four years to 2013/14, South West Trains passengers had ‘coughed up the largest subsidy to government coffers of any train company’ totalling just over £1 billion. Although this was ‘a truly staggering amount’ it appeared ‘quite arbitrary no-one could explain to him how it was calculated.'

South West Trains passengers recently ranked their service 3rd worst in the country in terms of value for money. 

Only 37 per cent thought they were getting value for money compared to 78 per cent of Grand Central passengers and 61% of Virgin Trains passengers, he said. 

Excuses from South West trains might be ‘easier to swallow’ if director remuneration at parent company Stagecoach Group ‘doubled between 2010 and 2014,’ he said. 

Nicknamed the 'Sardine Express,' Raab urged Transport Minister Claire Perry to acknowledge the  line's falws

He told ministers that during the pressing financial crisis his constituents have ‘rather stoically endured’ the immediate frustration of high fares and acute overcrowding: ‘But, when I stand on that platform, with my fellow constituents taking the Sardine Express up to Waterloo, I need to be able to explain how we are going to address the conditions of travel, which are often cramped and uncomfortable, over the long term.

‘I need to explain how we are going to deliver better value for money and to give them some light at the end of the tunnel.’

Transport Minister Mrs Perry said she had first-hand experience of the crush ‘Sardine Express’ having travelled on it during a ‘mystery shopping exercise’ on a day when four carriages had been removed. 

She said overcrowding was ‘perversely a measure of success’ because more people were using the railways. But she acknowledged the South West franchise, drawn up under labour, was flawed.
