America remains the home of plastic surgery with more procedures carried out here than anywhere else, but astonishing new figures reveal that South Koreans are having the most treatments per head of population.

The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks.

While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is booming with 
one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle.

America topped the list of countries where the most surgical and non-surgical procedures took place during 2011

Heidi Montag famously had ten plastic surgery procedures in one day, while Miss South Korea Yu-Mi Kim has also admitted to having cosmetic surgery

Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife.

One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper 
eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'.

It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.

Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.

Even Miss Korea 2012, Kim Yu-Mi, admitted
she went under the knife to achieve her pageant-winning good looks.

The
student revealed the secret after photos emerged of her looking very 
different at school, but she said she hadn't misled anyone.

'I never said I was born beautiful,' she told Korean media.

Plastic surgery procedures that took place in the U.S. in 2011 according to ISAPS

While South Korea topped the table in relative terms, when it came to total numbers of tucks,
peels, fillers, jabs and lifts in their quest for the perfect body, the
U.S. once again cemented its place at the top of the table in the poll 
of 20,000 surgeons.

There
were 1,094,146 surgical procedures in the U.S. in 2011 
including 284,351 breast augmentation and 223,066 lipoplasty procedures 
(where fat is liquefied and sucked out). Tummy tucks (abdominoplasty), 
eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) and breast lifts were also very popular 
surgical procedures.

Botox was by far the most popular non
invasive treatment with 815,150 treatments making up almost a quarter of
the 3,105,246 procedures. Also very common was people using hyaluronic 
acid (smooths wrinkles), laser hair removal, microdermabrasion (a 
skin-exfoliating treatment) and IPL Laser Treatment (repairs skin 
blemishes and sun damage).

Certain procedures are also more popular in particular parts of the world. Brazil,
known for its beach culture, performed the most male breast reductions,
bottom implants and 'vaginal rejuvenations' - where tissue in the area 
is 'firmed up for a youthful appearance'. 

South Korea had the most cosmetic procedures when taking population into account in 2010, while the UK came 20th

Meanwhile, nose jobs are popular in Asia, with China, Japan and South Korea among the top five nations for rhinoplasty.

The country performing the highest number of breast implants is the U.S., followed by Brazil, Mexico, Italy and China.

The U.S. and Brazil also come first and second for the highest number of eye lifts and tummy tucks. 

Meanwhile, as obesity rates rise a growing number of overweight adults are turning to surgery for a quick fix. 

Lipoplasty - a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before sucking it out  - was the leading invasive procedure worldwide. There were 1,268,287 procedures, which was just a fifth of the total.

It was followed by breast enlargement 
surgery, with 1,295,251 boob jobs. Third was blepharoplasty, otherwise 
known as eyelid surgery, with 703,610 cases and fourth was 
abdomnioplasty, otherwise known as tummy tucks, with 553,399 cases.

Finishing the top five list was rhinoplasty, with 478,023 people having 
nose jobs. More unusual procedures that made the
top 20 were buttock implants at number 13, with 75,591 pursuing a more 
prominent derriere.

Meanwhile just over 60,000 opted for chin implants 
and a further 47,000 or so went for a thigh lift.
