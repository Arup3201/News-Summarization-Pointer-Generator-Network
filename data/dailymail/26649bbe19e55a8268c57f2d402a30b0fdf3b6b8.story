Mark Noble is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the England squad ahead of the European Championship Finals despite being overlooked once again by Roy Hodgson. 

Noble has been one of the star performers since West Ham gained promotion back into the Premier League back in 2012. 

The 27-year-old has represented England at every level from the Under 16s to the Under 19s and was even made captain of the Under 21s team for the Euro Finals in 2009. But he has somehow failed to catch the attention of Hodgson who even called up Tottenham's inexperienced midfielder Ryan Mason ahead of him for the forthcoming games against Lithuania and Italy when Adam Lallana was forced to pull out of the squad with a groin injury.

However, Noble says he will not sulk over the matter and will continue to show his best form for West Ham as he looks to help the club push for a European place as they prepare to move into the Olympic Stadium next summer. 

Noble said: ‘I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country. But obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen. 

‘I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future.

‘When we move to the Olympic Stadium we have to be thinking about European football because of the gate receipts and the money coming into the club and hopefully we will be able to invest in better players. We invested really well last summer and that has shown this season.’ 

Noble hopes he will given a better chance of an England call-up following the proposals by FA chairman Greg Dyke this week to limit the number of non-EU players playing in this country. 

Harry Kane has come through the Tottenham youth system and only made a name for himself in the top flight back in November, but has already been rewarded for his outstanding season with his first call-up into the England squad this week.

Noble feels a number of other home-grown players could now follow Kane into the senior squad if they are given the chance to play on a regular basis. 

When asked about Dyke's proposals, Noble added: ‘I think that is great. When I came through into the league I was played at 17. You don't get that a lot now with players coming through the academies.

 ’If you do that you have to be very special because of the foreign players coming in. We have got the best league in the world and we want to keep it like that, but it will be nice to see some of our homegrown boys given a chance.’
