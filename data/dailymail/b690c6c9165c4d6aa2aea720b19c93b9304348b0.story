Decades after the last concentration camps of the Second World War closed their doors, many guards who were in charge of overseeing them are now being tried for suspected war crimes.

To secure convictions, prosecutors are using a mixture of testimonies and archived paperwork alongside modern techniques, including 3D modelling.

One model of the iconic Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland could even reveal exactly how much the guards were aware of during their time at the death camps, although images of this are yet to be released to the public.

A German prosecutor built a 3D virtual model of Auschwitz-Birkenau, stock image pictured, that model provides a 360-degree view of the concentration camp. It can be programmed to show what individual guards would have seen from watchtowers. This could be used to prove they were aware of deaths in the camp, for example

Officers from Queensland are using a 
handheld 3D scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and 
outdoor scenes of crime.

Called
 Zebedee, because of the way it moves like its namesake in The Magic 
Roundabout, the scanner has previously been used to produce models of 
famous landmarks and shipwrecks, yet this is the first time the 
technology has been used to fight crime.

Using Zebedee, also known as ZEB1, 
police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined
 spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and 
tripods.

It also means less disturbance of the crime scene and scans can be uploaded in almost real-time.

The surge in cases follows a landmark ruling in 2011 that set a precedent for guards to be tried for murders that happened during their watch, even if they weren’t individually involved in the deaths.

John Demjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor camp in Poland, was convicted for being an accessory to the murder of 28,060 people who died during 1943.

Up until then, cases required evidence linking suspects explicitly to specific killings.

Many guards have previously claimed the camps were so large they couldn’t possibly have known what was going on in individual rooms and sections.

While building a case into suspect Hans Lipschis, now 94, Stuttgart prosecutor Ralf Dietrich, used 3D modelling software to reconstruct Auschwitz and its outbuildings.

The digital model can be used with online tours, pictured, of the the camp, as well as other information, including the years guards served, and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps

His model provides a 360-degree view of the camp and it can be set to show what was visible from individual watchtowers.

Lipschis was a cook at Auschwitz and the model also reveals what was visible from the kitchen. 

‘Many former guards say that they didn’t know anything because they couldn’t see from where they were serving,’ Dietrich told Melissa Eddy at the New York Times. 

‘This allows us to go in and look at whether that is true. What could one see from a watchtower? Could you see the chimneys of the crematoria? Could you see smoke?’

The model can also be used with online virtual tours of the the camp, as well as other information, including the years guards served, and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps.

In February, the case was dismissed due to the age of the defendant but Dietrich claims its model could be used in future cases.

Cases have recently been opened into Nazi officers after a 2011 ruling meant prosecutors didn't need evidence linking guards to individual deaths
