Given her mother’s willingness to take on the law for a worthy cause, it’s little surprise Chrissie Hynde’s daughter has inherited something of a fighting spirit.

But it seems even fearless rock stars get a little anxious when their offspring are the ones doing the protesting.

Pretenders singer Chrissie, who was once arrested over her animal rights campaigning, has been fretting about whether daughter Natalie is ‘warm enough’ since she joined a group protesting against a new road.

The 28-year-old has swapped her comfortable flat for a snow-covered treehouse 15ft off the ground to try to prevent the development tearing through a beauty spot.

Miss Hynde, whose father is Ray Davies of The Kinks, said her 61-year-old mother was ‘delighted’ to see her taking a stand, but added: ‘She’s my mother so of course she’s anxious about my health and worried that I’m keeping warm enough.

‘She’s concerned about things like pneumonia, because it is bitterly cold. But she’s confident that I know what I’m doing and sensible. She knows that we all take very good precautions to make sure we stay healthy.’

Miss Hynde said her decision to join the protest group was in part because of the ‘inspiration’ of her mother, who was arrested in 2000 for protesting about animal rights outside a New York branch of the Gap clothing chain.

Miss Hynde said: ‘She’s been a great influence on me, and one of the reasons we are so opposed to this road is because of the impact it will have on animals in the area.

‘This is a wildlife haven and the road will destroy much of that.

‘But I have also found my own way. My main concern is climate change and the increased damage this will do to the planet by increasing emissions.

‘We should be encouraging people to drive less, not more.’

Miss Hynde moved to St Leonards-On-Sea in East Sussex last year, and joined protesters trying to protect the nearby Combe Haven Valley beauty spot just after Christmas.

Developers plan to build a link road that will connect Bexhill with Hastings, concreting over a swathe of ancient forest and rolling farmland in the process.

Medhurst said: 'I try to dig an oval-shaped hole which will hopefully support itself, it was perfected by the Vietnamese in the Vietnam War, and I'm willing to risk my life'

The Mail reported last week how many of those taking part in the protest are in their 50s and 60s and choosing to take up activism rather than wind down to retirement.

Miss Hynde’s fellow protesters include 58-year-old grandmother Hilda Stewart and Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ Medhurst, who dug a tunnel underneath the road building site in a bid to stop the development.

The group sleep in treehouses made from tarpaulin and cargo netting, huddling under muddy sleeping bags at night.

Miss Hynde said: ‘We all work together and have had great support from locals who have brought us wonderful vegan meals that we heat up over a fire in the evening. Of course, I have to be realistic and say that ultimately we are unlikely to win this battle against the road.

‘The main thing is to make a stand and make it as hard as we possibly can for those building it.’

Many observers say the Combe Haven Valley fight has rekindled memories of the ‘tree people’ of  the 1990s, when dreadlocked protester Daniel Hooper – known as ‘Swampy’ – briefly became a minor national celebrity.
