An explosion hit a major oil pipeline in a rebel-held district of Homs this morning as the Syrian government's bombardment of the city entered its 13th day.

Elite forces backed by armoured personnel carriers also stormed part of Damascus today, firing machine guns in the air, in the closest deployment of troops to the centre of the capital in the 11-month uprising.

Meanwhile, troops launched a new offensive on the city of Hama, firing on residential neighbourhoods from armoured vehicles and mobile anti-aircraft guns.

The escalation of the conflict comes as France's foreign minister announced it had started negotiating a new UN Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia and wanted to discuss creating 'humanitarian corridors' in the country.

China, which along with Russia vetoed a resolution earlier this month, was quick to warn that mistakes by the UN Security Council could worsen the bloodshed.

The leader of a global Islamic group also stressed that the international community must rule out military intervention as a solution to the crisis.

In Washington, a State Department official said the U.S. and its allies were closely monitoring Syria's stockpiles of chemical arms and portable anti-aircraft missiles amid concerns they could fall into the hands of militant groups.

The attack on the oil pipeline, near a large Sunni Muslim district, sent thick, black smoke billowing into the sky for several hours after the blast.

The Local Co-ordination Committees and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Homs pipeline was in the rebel-held neighbourhood of Baba Amro, which has been shelled by (LCC) regime troops for the past 12 days.

It was not clear what caused the explosion.

The authorities have accused 'terrorist saboteurs' of hitting the pipeline while opposition activists said the military, which began firing shells, mortar rounds and rockets into Baba Amro on February 3, has been hitting it by mistake.

The pipeline runs from the Rumeilan fields in the eastern Syriac Desert to the Homs refinery, one of two in the country, has been hit several times before during the 11-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.     

Footage from an activist's camera feeding live footage from Homs via the internet showed a dense plume of smoke rising behind houses in the district.

At around the same time, government forces launched a new operation today in another flashpoint city, Hama, after telephone, mobile phone and internet connections were cut, according to The Observatory and the LCC.

'Loud explosions were heard in the neighbourhoods' of Hama, the Observatory said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Elite Syrian forces erected roadblocks in the central Barzeh neighbourhood of Damascus as they moved deeper into the capital, residents and activists said.

Troops from the Fourth Armoured Division and Republican Guards erected roadblocks, searched houses and made arrests.   

Residents said the troops were looking for opposition activists and members of the Free Syrian Army, which has been providing security for protests against President Bashar al-Assad in the district.

France's foreign minister said today it wanted to discuss creating 'humanitarian corridors' in the country as it opened talks on a new U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia.

'We are renegotiating a resolution at the U.N. Security Council to persuade the Russians,' Alain Juppe told France Info radio.

He said the U.N. General Assembly would vote on a 'symbolic' resolution on Thursday that would add to pressure on the Damascus government.

Paris said on Tuesday it had created an emergency fund for aid agencies looking to help the Syrian people and would propose a similar one at an international level next week when countries meet in Tunisia to discuss the escalating crisis.    'The idea of humanitarian corridors that I previously proposed to allow NGOs to reach the zones where there are scandalous massacres should be dicussed at the Security Council,' he said.

Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Co-operation, said he remained involved in 'quiet diplomacy activities' with Syrian President Bashar Assad over the power struggle that has cost more than 5,000 lives.

The violence has led to the Middle Eastern country's most severe international isolation in more than four decades of Assad family rule.

'What we really need to do is exclude military intervention from our side,' Ihsanoglu told the National Press Club of Australia during a visit to Canberra as a guest of the Australian government.

Ihsanoglu, who was born in Egypt and lives in Turkey, said the lesson from conflicts in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia was that outside military intervention 'did not bring any good to the people of those countries and to the region... and to the world at large.'

Arab and Western countries had pushed for a U.N. resolution supporting calls for Assad to hand over some powers to defuse the crisis, but Russia and China vetoed the measure this month.

Ihsanoglu did not address a proposal put forth Sunday by the 22-member Arab League, calling for the U.N. Security Council to create a joint peacekeeping force for Syria and urging Arab states to sever all diplomatic contact with Assad's regime.

Syria immediately rejected the proposal, which was adopted by League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo.

A proposed U.N. General Assembly resolution, circulated Tuesday by Egypt, would strongly condemn human rights violations by the Syrian regime. It backs Arab League efforts to end the conflict but makes no specific reference to a peacekeeping force.

Diplomats say the resolution is likely to be put to a vote Thursday in the 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes. While General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, they do reflect world opinion on major issues.

The OIC was established in Morocco in 1969 at an Islamic summit of 25 Muslim countries 'to safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony among various people of the world.'

The U.S. and its allies are closely monitoring Syria's stockpiles of chemical arms and portable anti-aircraft missiles, a State Department official says, amid concerns that the country's unconventional weapons could fall into the hands of terrorist or militant groups while the 11-month-old uprising continues.

'Syria is a country of significant proliferation concern, so we monitor its chemical weapons activities very closely,' the State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence-related matters.

'We believe Syria's chemical weapons stockpile remains under Syrian government control, and we will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to impede proliferation (of) Syria's chemical weapons program.'

The official added that the U.S. is in discussion with its allies on ways to ensure that Syria's stockpile of portable anti-aircraft missiles, called Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADS, aren't stolen or diverted. 'We are consulting with allies and partners as we plan for a variety of contingencies,' the official said.

Meanwhile, a senior Chinese diplomat said missteps by the United Nations Security Council could cause worse bloodshed in Syria.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said the Security Council must be 'very careful' when dealing with Syria.

Cui reiterated China's position that it supported the role of the Arab League in seeking to defuse the Syrian conflict and 'inclusive dialogue' in Syria to end the violence.
