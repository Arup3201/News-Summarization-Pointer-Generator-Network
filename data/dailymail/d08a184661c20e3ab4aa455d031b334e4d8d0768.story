Relief: Neon Roberts, whose mother Sally tried to stop him having radiotherapy, has been given the all-clear after the treatment

A year ago, Neon Roberts was being taken to hospital for emergency surgery and radiotherapy on a brain tumour, against the wishes of his mother.

This Christmas, however, he is celebrating – after finally being given the all-clear following his life-saving treatment.

Neon was diagnosed with the tumour last year and had surgery to remove it in October.

He found himself at the centre of a bitter court battle after doctors said he needed a second operation and radiotherapy – and his mother, Sally Roberts, tried to stop the treatment from going ahead.

Mrs Roberts, who thinks doctors have been ‘brainwashed’ by pharmaceutical companies, ran away to stop them ‘frying his brain’. She took Neon to an alternative medicine centre in Sussex where he was given oxygen chamber therapy.

After a four-day manhunt, the pair were found by police. She took her case to the High Court, but a judge ruled Neon had to be treated conventionally.

He was ordered to live with his father and had his second operation days before Christmas.

Yesterday his father, Ben Roberts, revealed that after undergoing rounds of radiotherapy  and chemotherapy, Neon is in remission.

And his family said the eight-year-old boy is now ‘bouncing around’, despite his gruelling year.

Mr Roberts, 35, told the Daily Mail: ‘We are delighted to be able to share our family’s joy that all Neon’s scans, including one last week, have shown no sign of the cancer returning.

‘The treatment so far has been successful and on Monday the doctors told us that while Neon will continue to need to be monitored, this radio and chemotherapy phase is over. We couldn’t have wished for a better Christmas present.’

Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from West London, said the past year had been extremely difficult but described doctors at the hospital where he was treated as ‘exceptional’ and praised his son for battling through so bravely.

He currently has custody of Neon. Mrs Roberts, who spent last Christmas away from her son and his twin sister, Elektra, is prohibited from removing him from her estranged husband’s care.

Mr Roberts added: ‘Last October we received news that every parent dreads, Neon had a brain tumour that would kill him if he did not have treatment. Neon’s mother and I faced agonising decisions. We each reacted differently. Neon then embarked on a long cycle of radio and chemotherapy. Treatment and recovery has been Neon’s journey this year.’

He added: ‘It’s been hard for him and his family. We’ve been touched by the numerous messages of support we have received.’

Neon’s aunt, Lucy Roberts, added: ‘We are delighted that the scan is clear. Everyone is so happy. We want people to know Neon’s happy and he’s doing really well. I saw him and he was bouncing around.’

Mrs Roberts, a DJ originally from New Zealand, declined to comment on her son’s recovery last night.
