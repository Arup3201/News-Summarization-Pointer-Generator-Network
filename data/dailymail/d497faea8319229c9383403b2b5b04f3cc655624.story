Raheem Sterling's former club QPR stand to make £15million if the teenage England winger leaves Anfield in the summer.

Sterling will return to Loftus Road on Sunday for the first time since he moved to Liverpool in 2010 and Brendan Rodgers is expected to start the 19-year-old after he was controversially left on the bench by England in Estonia last Sunday with Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson claiming Sterling had told him he was 'tired'.

But Rangers will have a special incentive not to kick Sterling too hard.

Raheem Sterling was plucked from QPR as a youngster... but the club included a 25 per cent sell-on clause

Speculation remains over Sterling's future at Anfield with the youngster yet to sign a new contract

The deal to sell him to Liverpool for a cut-price £500,000 included a 25 per cent sell-on clause and with Real Madrid interested in £60million-rated Sterling if he doesn't sign a new contract at Anfield, Rangers would gain a healthy windfall.

That money would be especially welcome for owner Tony Fernandes who faces a £40m fine if the club are relegated to The Championship in breach of FPP rules.

QPR are currently bottom of the Premier League and manager Harry Redknapp, who held crisis talks with Fernandes and head of football operations Les Ferdinand on Friday night, could be sacked if they lose heavily this afternoon.
