Guilty: William Belfour faces a mandatory life sentence after he was found guilty on all counts

Guilty: William Belfour faces a mandatory life sentence after he was found guilty on all counts

In a gesture of unyielding compassion, Jennifer Hudson is offering prayers for the man found guilty of murdering her mother, brother, and young nephew.

The Academy Award-winning singer and actress wrote in a statement Friday evening that ‘the Lord will forgive Mr Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday.’

She and her sister Julia thanked God, their prosecutors, and authorities involved in the case, as well as those following the trial across the globe who offered encouragement.

They wrote: ‘We have felt the love and support from people all over the world and we’re very grateful. We want to extend a prayer from the Hudson family to the Balfour family. We have all suffered terrible loss in this tragedy.’

The sisters concluded: ‘It is our prayer that the Lord will forgive Mr Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday.’

Hudson's former brother-in-law was found guilty of murdering her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in what prosecutors described as an act of vengeance by a jilted husband.

The jury convicted 31-year-old William Balfour on three-counts of first degree murder on Friday, after three days of deliberations.

He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison.

Hudson was in court to hear the verdict, and wept softly as it was read, according to the Chicago Tribune. She then looked at her sister and smiled.

Daily devotion: Hudson attended every day of the trial

Though Balfour himself displayed no visible emotion as the verdict was read, family members in the courtroom cried.

Balfour’s
attorney Amy Thompson told the Tribune that she plans on filing a 
motion for a new trial in June, saying that there is ‘hope.’

Meanwhile,
Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez thanked the jury, and called 
the murders ‘vicious, cold-blooded, inhumane executions,’ according to NBC Chicago.

The jury was comprised of six men and six women.

Some of the jurors spoke to the press following their decision, saying that phone records were the tipping point amid a sea of circumstantial evidence.

The evidence that helped seal Balfour’s fate was the testimony from a forensic investigator who told the court how he triangulated Balfour’s location using cell phone towers.

‘Once we were able to piece the timing together…we were able to put a timeline together,’ juror Paula Holcomb said, according to NBC Chicago.

‘We realised that he could not be at two places at one time.’

Prosecutors had to build an 
overwhelming circumstantial case tying Balfour to the killings because 
there were no surviving witnesses.

Defence attorneys claimed the 
killings could have been related to Hudson's brother's alleged drug 
dealing.

'We have felt the love and support from 
people all over the world and we’re very grateful. We want to extend a 
prayer from the Hudson family to the Balfour family. We have all 
suffered terrible loss in this tragedy.'

-Jennifer and Julia Hudson

Hudson was the first witness called to the stand and she attended every day of testimony.

Balfour's attorneys proposed an alternate theory: that someone else in the crime-ridden neighborhood on Chicago's South Side targeted the family because of alleged crack-cocaine dealing by Jennifer Hudson's brother, Jason Hudson.

During the 30 minutes in which they called just two witnesses, however, they presented no evidence to support that theory.

Jennifer Hudson, who was in Florida at the time of the killings, attended every day of the two-weeks of testimony, sobbing when photos of her relatives' bloodied bodies were displayed to jurors during closing arguments.

Known for wearing designer dresses on Hollywood's red carpets, Hudson wore toned-down clothes at the trial, often all black.

Hudson, 30, rose to prominence as a 2004 American Idol finalist.

Setting: The drama unfolded at the Cook County Criminal Courts Building in Chicago, where the murder trial of William Balfour, accused in the killings of singer and actress Jennifer Hudson's three family members was being tried

Strong face: Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson has kept a bright outlook during the trial and was seen at The Pan African Film & Arts Festival in February

But she became a bona fide star for 
her performance in the film adaptation of the musical, Dreamgirls, for 
which she won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

The jury deliberated for three days and found Balfour guilty on all counts, including three of first-degree murder. The full charges are below:

He now faces a mandatory life-sentence in prison.

Hudson
was the first witness prosecutors called to testify, and during her 
more than 30 minutes on the stand she talked about her murdered family 
members and spoke endearingly about her nephew, Julian King, whom she 
called Tugga Bear.

She said she knew Balfour since the eighth grade but always deeply disliked him.

Balfour had lived in the Hudsons' three-story Englewood home after marrying Julia Hudson in 2006.

He moved out in early 2008 after falling out with his wife, but witnesses told jurors he often stalked the home.

The killings occurred the morning 
after Julia Hudson's birthday, and prosecutors said he became enraged 
when he stopped by the home and saw a gift of balloons in the house from
her new boyfriend.

After his estranged wife left for her
job as a bus driver on the morning of October 24, 2008, prosecutors said 
Balfour went back inside the home with a .45-caliber handgun and shot 
Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, in the back.

He then 
shot Jason Hudson, 29, twice in the head as he lay in bed.

Prosecutors said Balfour then drove 
off in Jason Hudson's SUV with Julian - Julia's son, whom she called 
Juice Box - and shot the boy several times in the head as he lay behind a
front seat.

His body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after a three-day search.

The defence tried to counter the 
portrayal of Balfour as an embittered husband by noting Julia Hudson 
continued to have sex with him until just days before the killings.

Prosecutors
say he killed the three victims in a jealous rage after his 
then-estranged wife, Hudson's sister Julia Hudson, refused to reconcile 
with him.

Defence attorneys argued the evidence tying Balfour to the October 2008 killings is circumstantial.

The announcement about the verdict came after jurors sent the judge a note saying they were split.

House of horrors: Memorials were placed outside the home of Darnell Hudson Donerson; she was found shot to death in her living room, and her son Jason was found shot to death in a bedroom of the home

Utter tragedy: The body of Jennifer Hudson's missing nephew was found in the back of a white SUV, three days after he had vanished
