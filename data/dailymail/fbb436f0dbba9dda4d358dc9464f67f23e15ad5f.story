Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has no interest in records as he bids to maintain the champions’ winning momentum.

City equalled a long-standing club best as they chalked up a ninth successive win in all competitions by beating West Brom 3-1 on Boxing Day.

Their feat matches one first recorded by the club in 1910 and last achieved during their hot streak of autumn 2011, which memorably included a 6-1 thrashing of Manchester United.

Fernando opened the scoring as he pounced on a Ben Foster error and Yaya Toure doubled the lead with a penalty after David Silva was fouled by former team-mate Joleon Lescott.

Silva made it 3-0 with a well-taken third 11 minutes before half-time after Lescott gave away possession.

City played a more conservative game in the second half as the rain and sleet developed into a heavy blizzard.

That gave West Brom some encouragement and they claimed a deserved consolation three minutes from time as Joe Hart missed a corner and the ball ricocheted in off Brown Ideye.

The victory kept City within three points of Chelsea at the top of the table but there is little time to reflect before Sunday’s game.

They now have a good chance to go one better as they host relegation battlers Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday, but Pellegrini is taking no notice of statistics.

The Chilean said: 'Really I am not aware of the records. We just want to continue adding points because it will be a very close fight for the title this year and we want to keep our title.'

City have played some superb football in recent weeks, making light of the absence of all their recognised strikers through injury.

Stevan Jovetic did make the bench at The Hawthorns after recovering from a hamstring injury but was not required as City raced into a 2-0 lead within 13 minutes.

Pellegrini said: 'This is very rare for me. Before 72 hours it is not good to play (again) but we know how it is here, in the Premier League. It is difficult for all the teams.

'The important thing is not to have an advantage for any one team.'

Jovetic could come back into contention for City, who have operated in their last two games with midfielder James Milner as a makeshift centre-forward.

Captain Vincent Kompany, the team’s talismanic central defender, could also return after hamstring and calf problems but the other two injured strikers, Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko, are still out.

Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted against a Burnley side which have shown plenty of fighting spirit of late.

He said: 'I have watched some games that they have played and I think they are playing well. I watched their game against Tottenham away.

'They are an offensive team, they play with two strikers and I think they have good players. If you think it is an easy game, you can have great problems.

'So we hope we will play against Burnley the same way we play against any other team.'
