Fears are rising that the deadly Ebola virus could be on its way to Britain after experts warned it could spread into the UK through meat.

Professors said ‘bush meat’ which has been smuggled into Britain could be carrying the virus, which has already killed at least 672 people in West Africa.

One scientist said the meat could ‘end up in a market stall in London’ as authorities across the country remained on high alert for the killer disease.

It is feared the bug, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, could have contaminated the thousands of pieces of meat which are smuggled into the UK and sold illegally to butchers and markets each year.

While the meat is often disguised as beef, it is often found to actually be the meat of wild animals such as rat, chimpanzee or antelope.

Professor Robert Dingwall, an expert in infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University, told The Sun: ‘Lots of wild animals carry the virus, and bush meat is often badly prepared.

‘Similar meat that could have caused this outbreak may well end up in a market stall in London.’

Humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. 

Of the 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat that enters the country every year,  55 per cent is said to be 'bush meat', which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets.

The latest warning comes as British airports and airlines remain on high alert to prevent travellers bringing the deadly virus back to the UK.

The latest outbreak of Ebola, which began in February, is the most severe since the disease was discovered in 1976. So far the disease has spread from a village in Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria in West Africa

Measures are in place to ensure that passengers showing symptoms of the bug are barred from boarding flights heading to the UK.

Anyone who appears ill on arrival into Britain will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.

However, because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.

Nearly 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters Britain each year – including cuts from exotic animals disguised as beef.

The charity Born Free Wild says animals from all over Africa, from giraffe to zebra, and even endangered species such as gorillas and elephants, are snared by poachers, butchered, and then transported to city markets and restaurants across the globe.

Bush meat is also smuggled into the UK hidden in suitcases by African travellers visiting relatives. Favoured delicacies include fruit bats the size of a small cat, antelope and cane rats.

Much will be dried or smoked but some will be raw and could carry infections such as Ebola or HIV.

In 2012, an undercover investigation by the BBC revealed cane rats and ‘smokies’ – charred skin-on sheep or goat meat – on sale in a north-east London market.

A year earlier, trading standards officers in the Midlands seized chimpanzee meat believed to be destined for restaurants.

Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms.

One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 672 lives in its worst-ever outbreak.

For the first time, the virus has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will reach Britain.

It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a ‘very serious threat’.

But he sought to calm fears, saying it is ‘most unlikely’ that Ebola could spread within the UK because of ‘frankly different’ standards of infection control here.

He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: ‘We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking ‘precautionary measures’ but he was ‘very confident’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK.

The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks.

Fears grew last week that it could spread internationally following the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos - Africa’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub.

Patrick Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease.

The Foreign Office has confirmed it is prepared for a potential outbreak in the UK, saying ‘the Government is confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here’.

It added: ‘We have experienced scientists and doctors – the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.’

What is Ebola?

Ebola is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever. This makes the body’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak, causing catastrophic internal bleeding. Up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention. The virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Why is the Government suddenly worried?

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter Britain from Africa. The latest outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages. In Guinea, the epidemic has reached the capital, Conakry.

What are the symptoms?

Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ The incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks.

Have there been any cases in Britain?

No. But Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading who studies viruses such as Ebola, warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the UK. The most immediate danger is that the virus will enter Britain on an airline flight. One victim, American Patrick Sawyer, had symptoms of the virus in Liberia but was allowed to board multiple international flights. Vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, he flew from Liberia, stopped over in Ghana, changed planes in Togo and died in Nigeria.

What is the connection with bush meat?

Bush meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests. It is thought humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. There are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into Britain – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year, and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat, which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets.

How contagious is it?

It is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis, which can spread for considerable distances through the air. Dr Fletcher said: ‘Ebola does not spread through the air. To contract it, you must have contact with an infected person’s blood or other bodily fluids, so the real risk is to family members and care givers.’

Should I worry?

‘The risk of anyone in Britain contracting Ebola is very small,’ stresses Dr Tom Solomon, an expert in viral infection, who is the director of the newly established Health Protection Research Unit. He adds: ‘If the outbreak in Africa is not brought under control, then that would increase the risk to people here.’

What if I think I have been in contact with an infected person?

Contact your GP immediately, although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from Africa rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries. If a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus, every other passenger on that flight will be contacted.

How can the disease be treated?

There is no cure for Ebola, although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs. Other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus. ‘Many people do survive,’ says Dr Fletcher. ‘Treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference. Loss of fluids is often a killer in Ebola cases. Up to half of patients can survive, if treated properly.’
