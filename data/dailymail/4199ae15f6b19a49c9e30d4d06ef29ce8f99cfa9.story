The prominent Harvard and Cambridge educated criminal law professor gunned down in his own home on Friday was shot point-blank in the side of the head, police said on Thursday.

However, police would not confirm whether he was shot in the front of his head or the back, which if it was the later, would indicate it was an execution-style killing.

Professor Dan Markel, 41, lost his life at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida and Tallahassee police have confirmed that there were no signs of forced entry.

This suggests to investigators that the Florida State University professor opened the door to his killer and almost certainly knew them.

However, they have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of a white Toyota Prius and have said that they are interested in speaking to the driver.

'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent.

'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.'

However, with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will volunteer and incriminate themselves.

'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said. 

Last Friday's shooting of the popular lawyer has stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in Florida's state capital, who demanded to know whether Markel had surprised an armed burglar or robber. No, Police Chief Michael DeLeo said - this was a premeditated murder.

Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway released photos of a vehicle of interest Wednesday and asked for anyone with surveillance in the area to contact police. The car appears to be a silver or light green Toyota Prius, though police will not confirm that.

Earlier this week, police in Tallahassee said that the killing of Professor Markel, 41, who was shot in the head at his home on Friday, was not a random act of violence - rather he was the intended target of an attack.

Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, died one day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far.

'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway.

Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am on Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home.

He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries.

'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.'

Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father

Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013

Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic.

Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming.

He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg.

Markel, the father of two young boys, ages 3 and 5, is divorced from fellow FSU law professor Wendi Adelson.

Her attorney, Jimmy Judkins, said that Adelson is cooperating with police and he told USA Today she is 'distraught, devastated, scared to death.'

Adelson, 35, currently is the director of Florida State University's Public Interest Law Center.

Police have admitted that the Harvard and Cambridge educated professor's death has left them mystified.

They are still working to find any witnesses who may be able to shed any light on the troubling case.

'The initial investigation has provided no indication that this case is connected to a burglary or robbery, and investigators are assuring residents there is no evidence this was a random act,' said the Tallahassee Police Department in a statement on Monday.

'Neighborhood residents should continue to be vigilant, but it appears at this time that Mr. Markel was the intended victim in this incident.'

Judkins said that the uncertainty was causing Adelson to become frightened.

'She’s devastated by it,' said Jimmy Judkins, her lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

'She’s a basket case over the plight of her children now. She’s scared because she doesn’t know who did this or why it occurred and it’s got her thinking the worst in so many different ways.'

Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year.

They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues.

Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect.

A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel.

'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read.

'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous.

'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.'

His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key.

Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.

'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.'

Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened.

'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught.

'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire.

'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'
