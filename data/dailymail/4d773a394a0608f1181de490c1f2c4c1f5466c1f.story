Danny Cipriani has turned his back on a lucrative move to European champions Toulon to sign a new contract with Sale, following his try-scoring comeback for England on Saturday.

The 27-year-old fly-half made his first Test appearance at Twickenham since 2008, as a replacement in the 47-17 RBS 6 Nations victory over Italy. 

His eye-catching cameo was further evidence that he has forced his way back into Stuart Lancaster’s plans - and that was undoubtedly a major factor in the decision about his club career.

The faith placed in him by Lancaster for a national team recall undoubtedly influenced his club decision

Cipriani joined Sale from Melbourne Rebels in 2012 and he has produced consistently outstanding displays for the Cheshire club over the last 18 months. 

Now, he has opted to stick with the Sharks for another two seasons, and Sportsmail understands that he will also take on the role of vice-captain.

Toulon had made informal enquiries about Cipriani and they came back with a firm offer late last month. 

But after being called into the England squad, he chose to reject the offer in order to stay at home and in contention for Test selection.

While Harlequins and ambitious Bristol are understood to have expressed an interest, Cipriani has settled in Manchester and was happy to stay with Sale. 

Negotiations have dragged on for several months, but terms have been formally agreed this week.

Having seen Toby Flood move to Toulouse at the end of last season, England head coach Lancaster will be relieved that another No 10 contender is not heading into Test exile across the Channel. 

Last month, he emphasised that Cipriani features in his long-term plans, saying: ‘I see Danny being around for hopefully the next three or four years.’
