St Louis schoolchildren chanted 'hands up, don't shoot!', pressing their faces to the glass and raising their arms out of open windows today, as their bus passed the convenience store where a man was shot dead by police on Tuesday. 

A 23-year-old, African-American man was killed by two cops after he allegedly lunged at the officers with a knife following a convenience store robbery in north St Louis.

The children mimicked the show of solidarity being used by protesters in Ferguson after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson.

The children who were on their way to school this morning were keenly aware of the convenience store parking lot as the scene of a shooting 

Eye-witnesses to the Brown shooting said that the unarmed teen raised his arms in surrender before he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head on August 9. 

School has not been interrupted in St Louis unlike in the nearby Ferguson-Florissant District where classes were postponed last week. 

The district announced that no school will be held all week in the area following the unrest. 

The 'hands up' gesture has been adopted during the ten days of protests in Ferguson and across the country at demonstrations. 

Firefighters hose off the area where St Louis police say officers shot and killed a 23-year-old man who was wielding a knife and refused to drop it on Tuesday

Eleven members of the Washington Redskins team ran out onto the field for Monday night's pre-season game against the Cleveland Browns with their hands up. 

The idea to show solidarity for the dead teenager came from safety Brandon Meriweather and cornerback DeAngelo Hall.

‘We just want to show our supporters what’s going on in St. Louis,’ Meriweather told WNEW. ‘That could have been any one of us,’ said Safety Ryan Clark.

‘That could have been any one of our brothers, our cousins. ...When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.’
