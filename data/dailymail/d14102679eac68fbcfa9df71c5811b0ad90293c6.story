British forces have left their last frontline outpost in Afghanistan, leaving Camp Bastion as the only UK-controlled facility in the war-toen country.

The closure of Observation Post Sterga 2 means the UK will no longer have a base in the Taliban-occupied river valley of Helmand province, where so many troops have been killed and wounded

Bastion itself is being rapidly dismantled and the last soldiers will leave in December. Sterga 2’s closure after eight years 
marks a major milestone in the winding down of a campaign that has cost 
the lives of 453 British personnel.

At the height of the war, Britain maintained 137 bases – and now all but the HQ, Bastion, have been closed or handed to the Afghan National Security Forces.

Troops from the 4th Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland and 9th/12th Royal Lancers were joined by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond last week for a ceremony at Sterga 2 to mark the closure.

The post, which is perched on a clifftop hundreds of feet above the River Helmand, remained occupied until this late in the campaign because of its strategic significance.

Analyst Peter Quentin, from the Royal United Services Institute said: ‘The closure of Sterga 2 is an inevitable and necessary step.'

He added: 'The base has ensured situational awareness and a platform for denying insurgents freedom of operation.

'As planners work towards B-Day – the final withdrawal from Camp Bastion – choreography of packing up Britain’s largest operational base since the Second World War is daunting.’

Last night, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment, but the closure of Sterga 2 will be officially confirmed today.

Mr Hammond has said: ‘The closure and handover of bases underlines the progress UK forces have made to increase security and stability across the province.’
