The scene was familiar: England’s players sat disconsolately on the floor as another tournament ended in disappointment and frustration.

For Gareth Southgate, though, there was a chance to apply perspective. England’ s adventure in Toulon may have finished with a 1-0 defeat to Portugal in the third-place play-off but their head coach was adamant the experience was beneficial.

‘We need games like this,’ said Southgate. ‘We can come away from here and know that we are not well short of the best nations. If we had not produced a performance, you might have been worried but the performance was there. They deserved better.’

*Ratings by Dominic King in Toulon

The eccentricities of the this 
tournament meant this game was staged 150 miles away from Toulon and 
that meant a significant change in the conditions. It was uncomfortably 
hot and each break in play saw drinks being hurriedly handed out.

Soaring
 temperatures, however, did not stifle the quality. Portugal started 
impressively and came within in the width of the crossbar of taking an 
18th minute lead, when Udinese midfielder Bruno Fernandes took dead aim 
from 20 yards.

But England 
defended stoically and finished the opening period stronger. With better
 fortune they could have even had the lead and Saido Berahino deserved 
better on 31minutes than to see Bruno Varela turn his shot away after 
good work from Tyias Browning and Nathaniel Chalobah.

James
 Ward-Prowse, England’s standout player of the past 10 days, also went 
close with a dipping free-kick, while Berahino worked another opening 
for himself but dragged his shot from 18 yards wide of the post.

It
 was England’s best spell of the tournament and one that would have been
 educational for Southgate. Portugal, who have won all six of their Euro
 2015 qualifiers, could be opponents next summer in the Czech Republic 
but they would be beatable with a full-team.

A
 similar pattern followed in the second period. Portugal began on the 
front foot – Middlesbrough’s Ben Gibson needed to stand firm when 
substitute Iuri Medeiros sensed a chance – but England gave as good they
 got.

Nathan Redmond, in 
particular, came to life and he started causing trouble for Portugal 
with his speed and directness. He went close to opening the deadlock 
twice with thumping shots after powerful runs. Gibson also had a good 
chance, a glancing header from a Ward-Prowse free-kick.

Yet
 just when it looked like they were moving in for the kill, England were
 hit by a sucker-punch. Berahino tried to clear his lines but succeeded 
only in smashing the ball into Liam Moore and the deflection ended at 
the feet of Horta, who guided his shot past Jack Butland.

‘You
 couldn’t make up some of the goals we have conceded while we have been 
here,’ Southgate said. ‘It’s quite typical of how things have gone. We 
were well on top at that point. The players applied themselves and they 
have been a pleasure to work with.’

That
 proved enough. England kept plugging on but couldn’t find a way 
through, meaning they matched the achievement of the class of 2002 in 
finishing fourth. It is inevitable they will return in the future.
