Web addresses that end in .ford, .tesco and even .gaga could be introduced under a major shake-up of the internet.

Domain names are currently limited to the 290 for countries including .co.uk and 22 suffixes such as .tel for telecommunications.

But the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which polices the internet, has voted for a major liberalisation that could add hundreds more address endings.

The new phase in domain names comes as the emergence of tablet computers such as Apple's iPad is changing the way people access the Internet

Groups able to put up a £114,000 fee can petition for the right to use nearly any word in any language, including Arabic and Chinese.

Firms, charities, political parties, celebrities and ordinary individuals would be allowed to apply under what is being billed as the biggest shake-up in the naming regime since the .com address appeared 26 years ago.

Peter Dengate Thrush of Icann said: ‘This is the start of a whole new phase for the internet.

‘Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free.’

Analysts say they expect to see between 500 and 1,000 new domain names, mostly companies and products, but also cities such as London and generic names such as .bank or .hotel.

Besides the fee, applicants will have to show a legitimate claim to the name they are buying.

Icann is taking on hundreds of consultants to adjudicate on the claims.         

It will accept applications for new names from January 12.

Shake-up: Internet regulators have voted to change the rules for domain names

Rod Beckstrom, ICANN President and CEO, said: 'ICANN has opened the Internet's naming system to unleash the 
global human imagination.

'Today's decision respects the rights of groups to create new top level domains in any language or script.

'We hope this allows the domain name system to better serve all of mankind.'

The move could usher in the most sweeping transformation of the Domain Name System since its creation in the 1980s.

More than 300 suffixes are available today, the bulk of them country-code domains, such as '.uk' for the United Kingdom and '.de' for Germany.

But potentially millions more suffixes could now be created, categorised by everything from industry to geography to ethnicity.

The new system could bring innovative branding opportunities and allow all sorts of niche communities to thrive online.

But businesses worry that they'll have to grab their brand names before others do. New suffixes could also create confusion as consumers navigate a Web with unfamiliar labels.

It's also possible that the new names won't make much difference because many people these days rely on search engines and mobile applications to find what they are looking for online.

It won't be cheap to operate a domain name suffix. The application fee 
is $185,000, and winners will have to pay $25,000 annually after that.

Disputes are likely as different groups go after the same domain. ICANN 
may auction off domains if multiple parties have legitimate claims.

Legal fees could also pile up as trademark owners and governments file 
objections to certain applications.

Trademark holders, in particular, fear they would have to register a lot
of addresses they don't need or want simply to keep others from using 
them.

Microsoft Corp., for instance, would not want websites addresses 
such as 'Microsoft.software' and 'Microsoft.computer' used to commit 
fraud or sell pirated goods.

Copyright owners, too, worry they would have to devote more resources to
fighting online piracy with a proliferation of websites ending in '.movies' and '.music' that distribute copyrighted content illegally.

ICANN has crafted rules meant to give trademark owners a first shot at 
claiming their brands. It would also have a process to quickly take down
addresses that are clear violations.

Consumers don't type web addresses into browsers nearly as much as they did 15 years ago when talk of a domain name expansion began.

'Most people don't pay a lot of attention to website addresses anyway these days,' said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land, a website that covers the search industry.

From a technical standpoint, domain names tell computers on the Internet where to find a website or send an email message. Without them, people would have to remember clunky numerals such as '165.1.59.220' for 'ap.org.'

The monikers have grown to mean much more, however. Amazon.com Inc. has built its brand on its website address, while bloggers take pride in running sites with their own domain names.

ICANN has already allowed two major expansions of the addressing system. In 2000, it approved seven new domains, including '.info' and '.biz.'

It began accepting new bids again in 2004. It has approved and added seven from that round, including '.xxx' for pornography sites this past March.

Under the expansion plan, future applications would be streamlined and open to all companies, organizations and individuals.

That has set off a virtual land rush.

A group of entrepreneurs in Las Vegas is vying to operate a '.Vegas' suffix. They have the city's endorsement and consider '.Vegas' a way to unify local merchants, entertainment venues, residents and even businesses beyond Sin City.

Former professional hockey player Ron Andruff is working with international sports federations to bid for '.sport.' He expects sports leagues, teams, athletes, equipment makers and fans to want websites with a suffix that defines them better.

Two groups - one backed by the Sierra Club and the other by the World Wildlife Federation - are separately seeking the right to operate a '.eco' suffix.

Big business will stake claims, too. Printer and camera maker Canon Inc. plans to apply for '.Canon'. Trade groups for bankers and financial-services companies are working together to explore bids for '.bank', '.insure' and '.invest' for their member companies.

New domains offer fresh branding possibilities for companies to identify themselves online in 'a more relevant or a more localized' way, said Pat Kane, a senior vice president at VeriSign Inc., which operates '.com' and '.net.'

Although suffixes added over the past decade haven't been as popular as '.com,' there has been demand for an expansion because nearly all of the most desirable '.com' addresses have been taken.

There are more than 94 million registered under '.com.'

Overhaul could see sites ending .apple, .orange or .sony
