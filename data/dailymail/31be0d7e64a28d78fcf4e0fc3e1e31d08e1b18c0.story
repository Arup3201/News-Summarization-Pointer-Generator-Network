An alleged former-bikie boss arrested on charges of extortion, threatening violence and stalking has converted to Islam.

A heavily-tattooed Brett Pechey, who goes by the name of Kaos, was arrested at Brisbane International Airport earlier this month after being forced to return to Australia due to a lack of funds after hiding in south east Asia since 2013.

The 26-year-old, who is the alleged former-president of notorious West End Bandidos gang and who police are investigating possible links to Brothers 4 Life, is known by authorities to have embraced Islam, according to The Courier Mail.

Mirways Sayed, the leader of Muslim organisation Ummah United which has been under scrutiny due to its alleged connections to bikie members and suicide bombers, voiced his support for Pechey following his arrest.

Ummah United claims it does not support extremist views, but rather tries to help men keep away from jihad and crime

'This is a true brother of mine. He loves peace loyalty respect honesty. Never hurt no [sic] body. May Allah help u brother we are here for u. Ummah united,' a post by Mr Sayed on social media read.

An earlier post said: 'Brother pechey is back may allah make it eazy for him [sic]'.

Ummah United claims it does not support extremist views, but rather tries to help men keep away from jihad and crime, according to the ABC.  

Pechey, who will remain in police custody until March 6, is facing charges of extortion, threatening violence, stalking, assault occasioning bodily harm in company, affray, breaking and entering while armed in company, rioting, breach of bail and a number of traffic offences, The Courier Mail reports.

Police are now investigating if the 26-year-old has possible links to notorious Brothers 4 Life gang 

Video footage (pictured) showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident in 2013, Det Insp Smith said

He spent more than a year living in Thailand - first Bangkok, then Phuket - after fleeing Australia following a violent bikie brawl at Broadbeach on the Gold Coast in Queensland in 2013. 

The alleged one-time bikie boss had been living off profits from a clothing business and funds channelled via friends and family in Australia. 

Pechey allegedly begged his grandmother for $25,000 when his funds ran out, but this was ignored on instruction from 'fed up' family members, forcing him to return to Australia, reported The Courier-Mail.  

Detective Inspector Brendan Smith said police had been pursuing extradition options when negotiations with Pechey led to him boarding a plane and handing himself in.

While detectives are still investigating Pechey's links to Sydney's Brothers 4 Life gang, Det Insp Smith said he seemed chastened by his time on the run.

'He certainly hasn't got the bravado that they would normally have,' he said. 'He appears resigned to the fact things have changed.'

Video footage showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident, Det Insp Smith said.

The other charges he's facing relate to a number of dawn raids conducted by police last March across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Logan.

The raids netted nine patched Bandidos bikie gang members and led to members of the West End and Centro chapters being charged with extortion offences.

Police claim they'd used standover tactics to intimidate victims, some cornered at gyms, into handing over money and property.

One victim even required facial reconstruction surgery after suffering a broken nose, fractured eye socket and chipped teeth, while another was allegedly threatened with a hand gun and a baseball bat.

Det Insp Smith said a number of criminal motorcycle gang members remain living overseas but are not currently wanted by police, saying: 'realistically, I hope they never come back'.
