Bill Cosby slammed rape allegations made against him in 2005, saying he had become a target because of his celebrity, newly surfaced audio has revealed.

The comedian spoke to The National Enquirer in 2005 shortly after one of his accusers, lawyer Tamara Green, said he had drugged and sexually abused her in the 1970s.

'Nobody ever wishes for a situation [like this],' he said in the  interview, which has now been shared by RadarOnline. 'Nobody ever really wishes for that.'

He added that nobody would want to put their loved ones in a situation that could 'cause great emotional stress'.

Fighting back: In newly surfaced audio from a 2005 interview, Bill Cosby (pictured in New York City in 2005) hits back at the media for 'unfairly' accusing him of lawyering up following rape allegations

After Green's allegations, the media accused him of surrounding himself with a 'humongous amount of lawyers', he said.

'That's unfair,' he continued, defiantly. 'I guess that a celebrity trying to protect him or herself is not supposed to use every ounce of protection. But this is all about celebrity, period!'

He repeated that he felt targeted because of his fame, saying, 'the celebrity should know better'.

Green came forward again this week to speak out about the assault she suffered at the hands of the comedian, now 77.

She claims that she an aspiring actress in the 1970s when she met Cosby, who promised to set her up with work connections. But before she could meet any, she fell ill with the flu. 

Accuser: He was interviewed shortly after Tamara Green, pictured this week, accused him of rape

He insisted on seeing her to give her something for the illness, she said. He gave her pills that made her unable to control her body and he sexually assaulted her, she said.   

She joined a growing number of women accusing Cosby of drugging them before sexually assaulting them, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson.

Dickinson told 'Entertainment Tonight' that Cosby had given her red wine and a pill when they were together in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room in 1982.

When she woke up the next morning, 'I wasn't wearing my pajamas and I remembered before I passed out I had been sexually assaulted by this man.'

Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, called Dickinson's charges 'false and outlandish' and said she was merely 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career'. 

The alleged assaults stretch from the 1960s until around 10 years ago, when Temple University employee Andrea Constand accused him of sexually assaulting her.

No criminal charges were brought in that case but she took him to civil court and ended up settling before she - and 13 other women - could testify about the alleged abuse they had suffered.

This time around, unlike in 2005, Cosby has spoken little about the accusations. 

Earlier this month, after one woman had already spoken out, the Associated Press asked Cosby about the accusations as an interviewer spoke to him about an art exhibition he is part of.

Staying quiet: In an interview with AP earlier this month, Cosby (pictured with his wife) refused to comment on recent allegations that he had assaulted women. He later asked AP to cut out that part of the interview

Cosby declined to comment, saying: 'We don't answer that.'  

In recent days,  AP went back through the full video of the November 6 interview and decided to publish Cosby's full reaction to questions about the claims.

It emerged that, at the end of the interview, Cosby asked the team not to use the section where he was asked about the accusations.

'And I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' he said.

But the interview was on the record. The AP had made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time.

Following the accusations, Netflix announced that they were postponing a stand-up comedy special featuring Cosby and NBC said it was scrapping plans for his proposed pilot. TV Land has also pulled reruns of 'The Cosby Show'.
