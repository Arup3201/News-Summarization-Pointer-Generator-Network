The trial against Osama bin Ladenâ€™s son-in-law has begun with prosecutors describing how he served as a motivational speaker for jihadists and agreed to be the public face of al Qaeda as soon as the planes hit the towers on September 11, 2001.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, whose trial began in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, was portrayed both as a murderous mouthpiece for al Qaeda and as a target of a prosecution designed to play on fears and resentments from the terror attacks.

In opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told the jury that bin Laden had summoned Abu Ghaith on the afternoon of September 11 and asked him to use his oratory skills as the public face of al Qaeda to recruit and inspire recruits to attack the United States again.

Public face: Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, agreed to be the spokesman for al Qaeda and sat beside the terror leader during their statement on September 12 praising the fatal attack

Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since suicide attackers struck the city's twin towers.

'While our buildings still burned, he agreed... in what is the most important moment in al Qaeda's savage history,' Lewin said, showing jurors a photo of Abu Ghaith sitting side-by-side with bin Laden in Afghanistan on September 12, 2001.

'He invoked his twisted view of Islam and declared, "Fight thee against the friends of Satan. Fight with al Qaeda against America."'

Defense attorney Stanley Cohen countered by pointing out that Lewin referenced the September 11 attack several times in his opening, even though his client wasn't involved in the plot.

'This is not Osama bin Laden,' Cohen said, pointing to Abu Ghaith.

Beginning: The opening arguments were heard Wednesday and the trial is expected to last about a month

'This is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a Muslim, an Arab from Kuwait, a husband, a father, an imam, a talker, an ideologue.'

The defendant, who wore a suit and tie to court, listened through an Arabic interpreter and occasionally took notes.

Abu Ghaith, 48, a onetime imam at a Kuwaiti mosque, was brought to New York from Turkey last year.

He has pleaded not guilty to charges he conspired to kill Americans after the September 11 attacks and provided material support and resources to a terrorist organization.

Born in Kuwait, he is married to bin Laden's eldest daughter, Fatima.

Prosecutors allege Abu Ghaith began his rise through the ranks of al Qaeda by becoming a motivational speaker at safe houses and training camps for aspiring jihadists in the weeks and months before September 11.

Afterward, bin Laden instructed him to lead recruitment efforts by appearing in widely distributed videos.

'For more than a year after, the defendant used the murderous power of his words to try to strengthen al Qaeda,' Lewin said.

Rhetoric: Abu Ghaith, center, was recorded sending messages to jihadists and is believed to have had prior knowledge about failed shoe bomb attacks that were planned- and thwarted- after September 11

He quoted the defendant several times, including one remark he said came weeks after the attack: 'These young men who have destroyed the United States and launched the storm of airplanes against it have done a good deed. The storm of airplanes will not abate.'

The government contends the statements are evidence that Abu Ghaith had prior knowledge of the failed shoe-bomb airline attack by Richard Reid in December 2001 and another plot to down a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in shoes.

Prosecutors are expected to introduce testimony via video feed of another former al Qaeda member in Great Britain who was in on the shoe-bomb plot.

Prosecuters also promised that they will be playing a taped confession later in the trial.

Abu Ghaith is allegedly heard telling how he helped recruit jihadists for the terrorist organization.

The tape was allegedly obtained by FBI agents when he was being transported from Jordan to the United States last year.

Cohen told jurors that they might feel outrage over some of the 'dumb' and 'stupid' statements made by his client. But he urged jurors to keep open minds.

'At the end of the day, there's really no evidence,' Cohen said.

'There is the substitution for evidence with fright and alarm.'

The first witness Wednesday was an FBI agent who traveled the world investigating al Qaeda before and after the September 11 attacks. The trial is expected to last about a month.
