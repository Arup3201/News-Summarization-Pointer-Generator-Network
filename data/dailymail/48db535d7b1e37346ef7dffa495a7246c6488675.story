Career criminal Christopher Dean 'Badness' Binse is back behind bars after stealing $235,000 from a Melbourne hotel and shooting at police in a 44-hour siege.

The hardened thug threatened two armed guards with a sawn-off shotgun during the armed robbery in March 2012 and pulled a gun on plain clothes police officers he thought were assassins sent to kill him.

When police tracked him to his home in Melbourne's north-western suburbs in May 2012, he fired at them sporadically over 44 hours before teargas ended the dramatic stand-off.

Banged up: Christopher Binse is back in jail after stealing $235,000 from a Melbourne hotel and shooting at police in a 44-hour siege

The 45-year-old was just 24 when a Victorian judge first told him to stop robbing banks and stay out of jail.

But 21 years later, he clearly hasn't learnt his lesson.

His most recent convictions are the latest chapter in a criminal history that has led to Binse spending more than half his 45 years in jail.

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Terry Forrest said on Friday that Binse's prospects for rehabilitation were poor.

'Your prior record and the gravity of your current offending necessarily leads me to conclude that the community needs to be protected from you,' he said.

'There is obviously a powerful need to deter you from reoffending.'

He sentenced the Keilor East man to 18 years and two months in jail, with a non-parole period of 14 years and two months.

Justice Forrest quoted former Victorian County Court judge Leo Lazarus, who in sentencing Binse in 1993 said his offending was 'about as bad as bank robberies can be'.

Justice Forrest said Binse's armed robbery and police siege had put lives in danger.

'When such crimes are committed, they cause terror to those immediately involved and apprehension in the wider community,' Justice Forrest said.

'You fired at or near police officers who were simply doing their job.'

The 45-year-old pleaded guilty to charges including armed robbery and possessing guns.

He had also been charged with making a threat to kill police who confronted him at La Porchetta restaurant, in Nidrie, in Melbourne's north-west, but was acquitted in a February trial.

When police searched his storage unit after he was arrested in May 2012, they found an arsenal of weapons, including a 1928 'Tommy gun' sub-machinegun.

Binse told police he had the guns because he feared for his life after a prisoner, who cannot be named, threatened to kill him.

The notorious armed robber is famous for once taunting police with a newspaper ad, 'Badness is Back', the day after he committed an armed robbery.

Binse has a habit for telling his victims: 'Thanks very much.'

He once sent Christmas cards to detectives, showing Santa carrying bags with dollar signs on them.

The cocky criminal, who was declared 'uncontrollable' aged 14, has tried to escape from custody eight times.

In September, 1992, he escaped from the St Vincent's Hospital security ward in Melbourne, with the help of a smuggled gun.

He was arrested in Sydney and banged up in Parramatta jail, where he then escaped soon after as prison officers fired shots at him.

While serving a 71‚ÅÑ2-year term for armed robberies in 1997, he became the only Victorian prisoner to be shackled in leg irons and handcuffs 23 hours a day. He lost an appeal to have his limbs freed.

In 2011 the notorious armed robber and prison escapee tried to sue Victoria over two alleged jailhouse assaults.

He claimed the injuries he suffered during assaults in jail were caused by the State of Victoria's negligence.

At the age of 14 Christopher Dean Binse was declared uncontrollable and put in Turana boys' home in Melbourne.

At 17 he was sent to Pentridge Prison, Victoria, and upon his release started to commit more serious crimes including numerous armed bank robberies.

He was given the nickname 'Badness' by a friend in Pentridge in 1988.

In September, 1992, he escaped from the St Vincent's Hospital security ward in Melbourne, using a smuggled gun left in the hospital.

In the same year, he was arrested in Sydney and escaped soon after from Parramatta jail while prison officers fired shots at him.

He was finally re-arrested in December, 1992, by police at a house near Daylesford, Victoria.

In 1993, Binse was the leader of a plan to free up to 30 of Victoria's most dangerous prisoners inside Pentridge's then top security H Division.

In 1996, he was jailed for 6 1/2 years over the 1992 armed robbery of a Commonwealth Bank, theft of more than $36,000 and escape from Long Bay.

In 1997, he lost an appeal against a ruling allowing wardens to put him in leg irons and handcuffs.

In 2001, Binse was one of the first inmates of the $20 million high-security jail within the Goulburn Correctional Centre, NSW.

In 2005, he was released from the super max jail after serving his full sentence and called for improved rehabilitation programs.

While back in jail in Port Phillip Prison in 2011, the notorious armed robber and prison escapee tried to sue Victoria over two alleged jailhouse assaults.

He claimed the assaults happened at Barwon Prison in May 2006, and at Marngoneet Prison in July 2007.

Soon after his November 2011 release from prison, Binse said he was assaulted 'by four bikies' and spoke about fears for his safety to another man, who was later shot dead.

In March 2012 he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery of two guards at the Westside Hotel at Laverton, in Melbourne.

On 23 May 2012 'Badness' was arrested after the 44-hour siege at an East Keilor home in Melbourne's north west, where he fired several shots at police.

Binse has served 28 of the past 32 years in some form of detention.
