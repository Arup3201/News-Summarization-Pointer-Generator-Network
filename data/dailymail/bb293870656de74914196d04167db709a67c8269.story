Seventy British holidaymakers were struck down by a vomiting bug that ruined breaks at two  resorts in Spain, it emerged today.

At least 50 fell ill at Club Mac Alcudia, on the Balearic island of Mallorca, and 20 at Stil Victoria Playa, on the neighbouring island of Menorca. 

Families described scenes 'like a horror movie' as they had their summer breaks ruined. It was also reported that several young children ended up in hospital.

Mother-of-two Emma Watkins, 32, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, told MailOnline how her holiday became a 'disaster' and her daughter was so ill she had to be taken to hospital.

'It was our first family holiday ever, the first time we had gone away with the kids and it was so traumatic.

'On the first day my three-year-old daughter was sick and then my son and then the rest of us. People were being sick everywhere, there were children throwing up all over the place, on the stairs, everywhere.

'We had to take my daughter Faye to hospital and she was really scared, she had to be injected and she had a drip, it was awful.

'The whole thing was a disaster, we stayed in our room most of the time and we lost our holiday and our money.'

She was staying at Mallorca's Club Mac Alcudia with partner John Briggs, 34, and children Nathan, nine, and Faye, three, having booked with Thomas Cook. 

When they returned from hospital, she said she found the hotel's swimming pools were closed with no reason given.

One visitor to the Stil Victoria Playa accused the tour operator Thomson of 'burying their heads in the sand' after they were informed that Thomson 'were not aware of any sickness'.

Several holidaymakers have also posted complaints about their stay at the Stil Victoria Playa on TripAdvisor.

Susan B, from Manchester, said: 'The food was poor throughout our stay and some food from the snack bar was terrible with chicken kebabs undercooked.

'We all became ill with the sickness bug with my four-year-old son getting it the worst. We confined ourselves to our room for 24 hours and reported our illness to a Thomson rep.

'Eventually we had to pay 120 euros to see the local doctor in the resort and pay for medicines. New people were arriving at the hotel and catching the bug and many people we spoke to afterwards had been sick.'

Another holidaymaker commented: '(We) asked to be moved to a different hotel on our fifth day. On arrival we had to ask for a new mattress in our room as ours stank of vomit, not a great start.

'By day two children were being sick all around us, in the dining room and around the pool. I can’t help but wonder why this is the second year running that this hotel is plagued by bugs when other hotels of a similar standard are not?

'The fact that our mattress was rancid and would not have been removed unless we asked suggests that although the hotel is being cleaned on the surface, this is not enough.' 

Holiday compensation firm Your Holiday Claims said dozens of tourists were now taking legal action against both Thomson and Thomas Cook.

Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: 'I have spoken to a large number of holidaymakers who have suffered illness at the Stil Victoria Playa and had their long awaited, hard earned holidays ruined.

'Many families have been forced to spend their holiday attending the local hospital and days confined to their hotel rooms.

'I am very concerned by the continuing reports of illness. It is vitally important that Thomson and the hotel management carry out a full investigation in to the cause of the sickness bugs at this hotel.' 

A spokesman for Thomson said: 'We are aware of a very small number of cases of sickness in Victoria Playa hotel, Menorca, with symptoms experienced similar to a virus.

'Our holiday advisors in Menorca have been supporting and advising any customers who have reported that they are unwell. No new cases have been reported within the last week.

'A thorough investigation has been conducted by an independent health and safety consultant, who has also confirmed that the correct containment procedures are in place.

'Thomson closely audits all the resorts to which we operate to ensure that health and hygiene levels are maintained and 93 per cent of customers who stayed at the hotel over the last four weeks have rated it as good or excellent.'

A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'We take health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our guests is our number one priority. In early June of this year, a very small number of our customers staying at the Club Mac Alcudia in Majorca reported a stomach upset, usually lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours.

'We are aware that a statement was recently issued by a no-win, no-fee lawyer, which contains as yet unsubstantiated allegations with regards to the nature of this illness.

'Preliminary indications from the independent hygiene consultant and our own investigations suggest that this was of a viral nature.

'We know how important holidays are to people and how upsetting it can be when even a small number of customers fall ill while overseas. The Club Mac Alcudia management put into place internationally recognised Prevention of Spread of Infection procedures, and an independent hygiene consultant supported their efforts while ensuring that the relevant guidelines were being followed.

'We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.

'We are confident that those customers due to travel to the resort in the future will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from a Thomas Cook property. Accordingly, normal booking conditions apply.'

It comes after a sickness bug left at least 100 British tourists ill, with several on drips after it swept through an Egyptian holiday resort.

Holidaymakers at the Coral Sea Waterworld complex were affected by the bug, thought to be Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever.

People staying at the four-star resort in Sharm el Sheikh said some tourists were confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel, with some on intravenous drips.

Many of those affected blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers.
