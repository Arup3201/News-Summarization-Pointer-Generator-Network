Armed police officers are patrolling estates in the Luton area, where there are growing fears that violence between rival gangs could continue

A 16-year-old boy who was shot in the back in Luton is the ninth victim of guncrime in the area this year.

The teenager remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital.

Armed police officers patrol the area of the shooting, as fears grow that there could be more trouble between rival gangs.

A £1,000 reward has been offered for information that will help with the arrest of the gunman.

Police are looking for a man who was seen in the area at the time of the shooting in the early hours of Saturday morning.

He is described as being in his mid-teens, white, wearing a blue top and jeans.

They have upped their presence on two estates and are using stop and search powers in their hunt for the offender.

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Richer said: 'Since January we have seen an escalation in gun crime in the town.

'Any person carrying a firearm or weapon on the street can expect to be 
confronted by armed patrols who will search them, arrest them and 
prosecute them.

'We understand that there will be a number of law-abiding citizens who will be affected by this action.

'We hope that they will understand that this action is being taken to keep them and their loved ones safe and they will agree with us that this level of criminality will not be tolerated.

A reward of £1,000 has been offered by heads at Luton police station (pictured). They are appealing for information about Saturday's shooting, which is the ninth in the area this year

Emergency services were called to the scene just before 4am yesterday after residents reported hearing gunfire.

Detective Inspector Sean Quinn said: 'We believe this was a targeted incident and we would urge anyone who has information about this shooting or anyone who can help identify the person seen leaving the scene to contact the police immediately.'
