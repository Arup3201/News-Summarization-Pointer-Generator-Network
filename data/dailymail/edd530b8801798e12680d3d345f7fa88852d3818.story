A BDSM-themed advertisement for Domino's Pizza is making the rounds online.

The image shows a human tongue tied in spiked chains and sporting a ball gag. The tongue has visible wounds and cut marks - and a hat and whip are seen lying on the ground. 

The advertisement - apparently set in a dungeon - is meant to promote Domino's Sriracha pizza.

New look: The spec Domino's Pizza advertisement for its Sriracha pizza says 'You're going to suffer and enjoy every moment' 

The slogan 'You're going to suffer and enjoy every moment' is even wrapped in a chain with spikes around the Domino's Pizza logo. 

However, the company said no to the advertisement's design.

'We’re as shocked as everyone,' Tim McIntyre, a spokesman for the pizza company, told Daily Mail Online in an email exchange. 'The ad was created and pitched by an ad agency to its client, the independent franchise company in Israel.'

He continued, 'The ad was rejected because it was ill-advised, unfunny and not brand-appropriate. In a word, it was stupid.'

'Somehow, it got leaked,' McIntyre added. 'When I first saw it myself, I thought it was a parody, just in time for the premiere of "Fifty Shades of Grey." I'm still shaking my head.'

McIntyre confirmed to Daily Mail Online that ad agency McCann Erickson Tel Aviv pitched the design.

Domino's Pizza has said in multiple exchanges with Twitter users that  'This was created with unauthorized use of our branding. The people responsible are being dealt with.'

'It never officially appeared anywhere,' the company Twitter account told Cosmopolitan of the advertisement.

E.L. James' novel 'Fifty Shades of Grey' covers the BSDM relationship and romance between protagonists Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.

A film adaption of the book, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Steele and Grey, respectively, will be released in movie theaters on February 13.
