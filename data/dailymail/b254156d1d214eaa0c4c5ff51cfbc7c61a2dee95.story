Loss: Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz, 26, who faced 35 years in prison over wire fraud charges at MIT, took his own life at his Brooklyn home on January 11

Internet activist Aaron Swartz's 
father told his son's suburban Chicago funeral that the Reddit 
co-founder was ‘killed by the government.’

The 26-year-old was found dead of an 
apparent suicide in his New York apartment Friday. His funeral was 
Tuesday morning at the Central Avenue Synagogue in his home town of Highland Park, Illinois.

Swartz was facing a potentially 
lengthy prison sentence after being indicted in Boston in 2011 for 
allegedly gaining access to academic articles from a computer archive at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The charges carried a 
maximum penalty of decades in prison.

Echoing the sentiments of the 
family's previous statements about the tragedy, Robert Swartz said during the service that
his son was ‘hounded’ by the government.

Spokeswoman Christina DiIorio-Sterling in Boston says U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz has no comment about Robert Swartz's remarks.

Swartz was charged last September with  wire fraud, computer fraud and 
unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer after he allegedly tried 
to steal millions of scholarly papers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2011.

It
is thought that the stress and strain of the looming federal trial 
contributed to the depression which is being blamed for Swartz taking 
his own life on January 11 at his Brooklyn, New York apartment.

Swartz's lawyer had originally approached federal prosecutors in fall 2012 about a deal and was turned down.

Then just two 
days before he committed suicide, another plea deal was turned down by federal prosecutors.

Elliot Peters, Swartz's lawyer, spoke to the Massachusetts attorney's office on January 9 to see if a plea bargain could be reached that would reduce prison time and $1million fines that the 26-year-old was facing.

However Peters told the WSJ that Assistant
U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann was adamant that Swartz must
plead guilty to every count and jail time would be required.

Swartz's distraught family has blamed MIT and federal prosecutors for his 
death.

In an earlier statement, Swartz's loved ones 
had claimed the Boston attorney's office had pursed an 'exceptionally harsh array of 
charges' for a supposed crime that had no victims, and MIT refused to 
stand up for Swartz or it's own 'cherished principles'.

'Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy,' his family and the 26-year-old's partner Taren Stinebricker-Kaufmann, wrote.

'It is the product of a criminal 
justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. 
Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s office 
and at MIT contributed to his death.'

In a Boston court on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Heymann and colleague Carmen Ortiz filed to dismiss the charges against Swartz. The case was dismissed because of Swartz's 
death, such filings are routine when a defendant dies before trial.

Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology's president spoke on Monday of his sadness over Swartz's suicide and 
said there would be 'thorough analysis' into the school's role in the 
federal case against the 26-year-old computer programmer.

MIT president L. Rafael Reif said: 'I want to 
express very clearly that I and all of us at MIT are extremely saddened 
by the death of this promising young man, who touched the lives of so 
many.

'It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy.'

The
statement came as hundreds of academics posted links to 
copyright-protected journals online in tribute to internet activist 
Swartz.

The movement 
appears to have started on Swartz's own site Reddit and was echoed by 
Anonymous on Twitter, who wrote: 'Please share: Academics posting their 
papers online in tribute to Aaron Swartz using hashtag #pdftribute 
#ICYMI.'

Even officials at JSTOR -  an archive of academic journals to which universities, including MIT, pay large amounts of money for access - slammed the harsh tactics of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston.

Swartz's family described him as 'extraordinary and irreplaceable.'
They said his 'insatiable curiosity, 
creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for 
selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable'
made the world and their lives far brighter.'

Intimidated: The family of Aaron Swartz, left, and his partner Taren Stinebricker-Kaufmann, right, blame MIT and federal prosecutors for his death

Our beloved brother, son, friend, and partner Aaron Swartz hanged himself on Friday in his Brooklyn apartment. We are in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing.

Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable - these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter. We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world.

Aaron's commitment to social justice was profound, and defined his life. He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more.

Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles.

Today, we grieve for the extraordinary and irreplaceable man that we have lost.
