Trolls: Cycling hero Sir Chris Hoy has been subjected to vile online abuse after making comments about the prospect of Scottish independence

Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy has been subjected to offensive abuse from nationalist campaigners after he raised concerns about Scottish independence.

The Scottish cycling hero was branded a ‘bigoted anti-Scot’, a ‘t*****’, a ‘creep’ and an ‘imbecile’ by the online army of so-called ‘CyberNats’.

The disgraceful remarks have sparked fury, with a UK minister calling on Alex Salmond to take action amid fears of ‘lasting damage to damage Scotland’s reputation’.

Sir Chris has won legions of fans across the globe with his passion and professionalism on the track.

But Britain’s greatest ever Olympian became an enemy for the CyberNats after he warned that Scottish athletes will find it harder to challenge on the world stage if the country becomes independent.

The six-time gold medal winner explicitly refused to reveal his voting intention, insisting he did not want to get involved in the ‘hornet’s nest’.

But that did not stop the online abuse from pro-independence supporters who use Twitter and news websites to attack Unionists.

Twitter user J McG Linklater – whose profile picture includes the SNP logo - wrote: 'I’ve always said Hoy is a bigoted anti-Scot.'

Gareth Lewis wrote on the micro-blogging site: 'Naff off Chris Hoy you soft s**.'

Others attacked Sir Chris’s upbringing and his schooling at Edinburgh’s George Watson’s private school.

One anonymous online comment stated: 'Schooled at an expensive Edinburgh private establishment where pupils were expected to sing God Save the Queen on a regular basis - maybe it got engrained?'

Concerns: Gold medal-winning cyclist Sir Chris Hoy warned Scottish athletes would find it harder to compete on the world stage as an independent nation

Last night, Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: 'The negative and personal tone of the attacks on Sir Chris is shameful and casts the referendum debate in a poor light.

'This could deliver lasting damage to damage Scotland’s reputation abroad and lead to unnecessary hostility here at home. Everyone has a responsibility to guard against the independence debate leaving scars that last well beyond [next year’s referendum in] September next year.

'I believe it would be helpful if the First Minister and the Scottish Government were explicit in their condemnation of those trying to shout down the views of Sir Chris and others. The debate on our future must be open to all.'

The row comes just weeks after comedian Susan Calman revealed she was reduced to tears by online trolls after she cracked jokes about the independence referendum.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage also faced anti-English abuse from a largely pro-independence crowd of protesters on a recent visit to Edinburgh.

Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: 'First comedienne Susan Calman, then Nigel Farage, now Olympic great Sir Chris Hoy - the nationalists seek to silence everyone they disagree with. If this is the kind of Scotland we'll get with independence I am sure even more will reject the nationalists' plans.

'When I stood up for Nigel Farage's right to speak I did so irrespective of his views. The same applies to Chris Hoy and anyone else's right to free speech.'

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, Sir Chris said: 'I've said numerous times how proud I am to be Scottish and how proud I have been to compete for Britain too, and I don't think these two things necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.'

Discussing the prospect of a separate Olympics team in an independent Scotland, he said: 'It would not be quite as simple as just saying, 'there is a Scottish athlete, they have won a gold medal, therefore that's a medal for Scotland'. Most of the athletes have had to move to facilities which are often outwith Scotland.'

Last night, an SNP spokesman said: 'Chris Hoy is one of Scotland’s greatest Olympians and we are all proud of his achievements. We join Willie Rennie in condemning these comments regardless of what party political persuasion they come from. Online abuse has no place in the political debate.

'It’s a matter of public record that [Deputy SNP leader] Nicola Sturgeon has been sent death threats on Twitter, a posting on the No campaign’s Facebook page talked about firing bullets into SNP leaders, appalling remarks about Alex Salmond's dad were made on a Labour Party website, and the abuse directed at Susan Calman was disgraceful.

'All of it must stop, because the referendum debate needs to be a positive one with the people about what Scotland can achieve as an independent country.'

A Scottish Government spokesman added: 'The debate on the referendum and our nation’s future must be a positive one – the people of Scotland deserve no less. We utterly condemn any forms of abuse either on or offline.

'Scottish Government ministers have made clear said that everyone involved – on both sides of the debate – has a duty to conduct themselves properly.'
