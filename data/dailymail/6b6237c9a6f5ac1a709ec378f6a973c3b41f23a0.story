Burnley are making an improved £3m offer for West Bromwich Albion defender Craig Dawson.

The 24-year-old Rochdale-born centre-back is keen to link up with Sean Dyche as he believes he will get a regular run in the side and has asked to leave.

Burnley are also keen on Nathaniel Chalobah at Chelsea and will ask to take the 19-year-old on loan.

Wanted: They are also interested in Chelsea's Nathaniel Chalobah

Dawson signed for the Baggies in 2010, but has made only 21 league appearances for the club since, spending time on loan at former club Rochdale and Bolton in recent seasons.

Chalobah, meanwhile, is one of Chelsea's most promising youngsters, but has yet to make a senior appearance for the club.

He spent the 2012-13 season on loan at Watford, when they made it all the way to the play-off final, and had spells last term and Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough.
