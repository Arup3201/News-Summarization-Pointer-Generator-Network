A quarter of Britons would fall out with their friends if they discovered they were Ukip supporters, a poll has revealed.

Despite a surge in support Ukip remains by the far the most toxic of the all the main political parties.

Three times as many people said they would ‘find it harder to stay close with a good friend’ if they voted Ukip than if they supported the Tories.

Just under one in four voters would fall out with their friends if they revealed that they were Ukip supporters

Just one in 14 Britons said they would struggle to stay friends with a Conservative supporter – compared to one in four who admitted they would not be able to remain close to a Ukip voter.

Labour is the least ‘toxic’ of all the main Westminster parties – with just three per cent of the public admitting that they would stop being friends with someone who backed Ed Miliband.

Five per cent of voters would stop being friends with Lib Dem supporters, according to YouGov.

Pollsters asked 1,970 adults 'if a good friend became a supporter’ of Ukip would you ‘disagree AND find it harder to be friends with them'.

Labour and Lib Dem supporters are the most prejudiced – with four in 10 of Mr Miliband’s backers admitting that they would fall out with their friends for backing Ukip.

Some 42 per cent of Lib Dem supporters would ‘find it harder’ to be friends with anyone who backed Mr Farage.

Ukip also provokes stronger feelings among youngsters, with more than a third of 18-24 olds admitting that they would fall out with a friend for voting for the Eurosceptic party.

Just 16 per cent of over 60s, meanwhile, admitted that they would struggle to remain close to a Ukip backer.

Supporting Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron is less likely to end friendships than supporting Nigel Farage

Respondents were allowed to say whether they would ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ with their friend, but also whether it would affect their friendship either positively or negatively.

While most Labour voters would ‘disagree’ with their friend if they began supporting the Conservatives, only 14 per cent would find it harder to stay friends.

Overall, only 3 per cent of voters would find it difficult to be friends with a Labour supporter, 3 per cent would find it difficult with a Green supporter, 5 per cent for a Lib Dem and 7 per cent for a Conservative.
