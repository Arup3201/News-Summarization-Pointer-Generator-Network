Theo Walcott believes the Arsenal forward line could turn out to be the best in the club's history - but they must prove exactly how good they are by winning plenty of silverware.

The 25-year-old, who missed the vast majority of 2014 through injury, believes the current crop - which includes Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - can top that of the Invincibles' line-up which included most notably Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp.

Walcott told Arsenal player: 'When I came here, it was Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg, Bergkamp, Thierry and Jose Reyes - that's some attacking force as well.

Thierry Henry: 228 goals in 376 games

Dennis Bergkamp: 122 goals in 425 games 

Robert Pires: 84 goals in 284 games 

Freddie Ljungberg: 72 goals in 328 games

Alexis Sanchez: 18 goals in 30 games

Olivier Giroud: 46 goals in 112 games

Santi Cazorla: 25 goals in 126 games

Danny Welbeck: 7 goals in 20 games

'I think this squad probably does beat it, but we need to prove it first. 

'When we go and achieve a little bit more than winning the FA Cup, then I think we can stand up and say this is the best attacking line up we've ever had.'

After a below-par beginning to the season by their standards, Arsene Wenger's side have been much-improved of late, losing just once in eight previous outings.

And that was clear for all to see on Sunday as they produced a sterling display at the home of the champions, Manchester City, running out 2-0 winners.

Walcott has also lavished praise on Arsenal's star performer so far this term, that being Chilean forward Sanchez.

He added: 'You see somebody working so hard and it makes you want to try to back him up.

'When you see what he does off the pitch, behind the scenes at the training ground, and how much work he puts in, all the players just stand up and think: Yeah, I need to do a bit more as well then.'

Next up for the Gunners is a trip to Brighton in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday, before returning to Premier League action at home to Aston Villa the following week.
