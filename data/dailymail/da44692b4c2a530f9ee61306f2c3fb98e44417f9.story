Teenage sprint sensation Matthew Hudson-Smith will face his hero Kirani James for the first time at the Sainsbury’s Birmingham Grand Prix tomorrow — but says taking his driving test this week was much more daunting.

Hudson-Smith, who announced his arrival on the international scene by clinching a 400 metres silver medal at the European Championships, earned green L-plates after passing his exam.

He won’t be racing behind the wheel any time soon as he still doesn’t have his own car, but reaching top speed around a lap of the track at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium is his sole focus in any case.

Hero: Hudson-Smith will face his idol Kirani James tomorrow

A personal best of 44.75sec won the 19-year-old the silver medal behind his friend and mentor Martyn Rooney at the European Championships in Zurich — an astonishing improvement of four seconds in 12 months — and he views today’s Diamond League event as another stepping stone to fulfilling what many believe is his world-class potential.

Grenadian James, the reigning world, Olympic and Commonwealth champion, is the figure Hudson-Smith aspires towards and competing against such a calibre of athlete will provide valuable experience.

He wants to pick up tips from James, just two years his senior, as well as get his autograph. But there will be no trepidation when it comes to racing on a track he has trained on since the age of nine — which is more than can be said for that driving test.

‘I’ve been learning for quite a while,’ he says. ‘A long time, let’s just say that. I’ve failed a couple of times.

'I can run in front of thousands of people but in a car I get pretty nervous. When I was doing the manoeuvres I was shaking all over the place. The left-hand reverse was a bit tricky. I don’t have a car, I’ve been catching the bus to training.

‘Kirani James is the biggest name in the business at the moment. I am a huge fan. This will be the first time I’ve raced him. Me and my friends are always mimicking his interviews.

‘On the track I will be in race mode but off the track I’ll be wanting pictures, autographs. I’ll be going crazy. 

'I’ve met him before but now I can get a proper talk with him. I’m definitely going to try and pick his brains. He’ s won everything and he’s only 21. I want to do the same as him. I do want to beat him.

‘I know that track like the back of my hand. I haven’t got a time in mind. Every race is a learning experience, I want to get a bit more consistency.’
