A 68-year-old Ukrainian grandmother has been nicknamed 'The Punisher' after completing a gruelling military training alongside army cadets four decades her junior.

Footage from the army's training camp shows pensioner Ekaterina Bilyik rolling over snow-covered fields, leaping to her feet and firing assault rifles alongside the young men in her troop.

She is now preparing to take part in the fierce fighting  that has torn eastern Ukraine apart.

Mrs Bilyik said she decided to sign up after watching the horrific scenes of carnage in which Russian-backed separatists violently clashed with pro-Ukraine fighters.

The mother-of-three children and grandmother-to-five is from the town of Zhidaev close to city of Lviv in western Ukraine.

She said: 'I have lived here all my life and we survived the Nazi occupation and the Soviets, and I believe in standing up for what's right and making sure we never see occupation again.

'I wanted to set an example, to show young people that no matter how old you are you can make a difference, and that was why I decided to sign up.'

Army spokesman Nataliya Ishenko confirmed that the grandmother had taken part in the same military training as other recruits, who were on average four decades younger than her, and that she had passed all the tests and could use a gun with as much accuracy as the rest.

After completing the training she says she is now ready to go to the front line.

Local news website Tengrinews said the other men in her squad had given her the nickname 'The Punisher' because of the way she talked about what she was going to do the Russian-backed separatists.

She said: 'We need to give them the message that Ukraine is a free country, and if they don't like it, they can go back to Russia.'

The mother-of-three said she was inspired to join up after seeing the scenes of carnage in Ukraine's east
