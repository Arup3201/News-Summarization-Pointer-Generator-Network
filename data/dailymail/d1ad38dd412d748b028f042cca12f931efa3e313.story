As three young talented brothers, there was always a chance their sporting careers would go down similar paths.

But twins Rio and Cole Dasilva and their older brother Jay are unlike any other footballing family - as all three have been snapped up by Premier League Chelsea in a unique transfer deal.

The talented twins, aged 12, and their 13-year-old sibling, joined Chelsea from Luton Town in separate deals each worth an undisclosed five-figure sum.

The Dasilva's could also net Conference Premier side Luton a further £1million if they make the Chelsea first team.

Luton's head of youth Gregg Broughton told lutontown.co.uk: 'I am hesitant to talk about the boys in the collective term because they all have wonderful unique attributes but this is a historical deal to see three brothers transferred together

'Jay is a special talent, a fantastic student of the game whose temperament compliments his technical ability.

'Cole has strong physical attributes and is very comfortable in possession while Rio is a real livewire whose ability to play in tight areas has always allowed him to shine.'

Three's a crowd: Rod, Danny and Ray Wallace all lined up together for Southampton in 1988

Rio, Cole and older brother Jay have been part of Luton's academy since the age of seven.

The compensation which Chelsea agreed to pay also includes payments should the trio rise through the ranks.

The overall deal is worth a seven-figure sum if they all go on to make the Chelsea first team.

The deal is not the first time Chelsea have favoured footballing siblings in transfer deals.

Chelsea are not averse to sibling signings, after having brothers Graham and Ray Wilkins on their books

The 2010 Premier League Champions had Ray and Graham Wilkins play for the Blues in the 1970s, as well as Ron and Allan Harris in the 60s and John and Peter Sillett in the 1950s.

English football is littered with instances of brother playing for the same team - from the Charltons for England to the Neville Brothers at Manchester United and the Toures at Manchester City to name just three pairs.

To find three footballing brothers in the same side, however, you have to go back to October 1988 when Rod, Ray and Danny Wallace all lined up for Southampton against Sheffield Wednesday.

Chelsea agreed to pay Luton compensation to secure the services of the three young brothers, in a deal which could earn the Conference side £1m

Gregg Broughton added: 'Following our loss in the play-offs last season we were told that the boys wished to look at other options, as was their prerogative to do so, and now after six months of uncertainty, we are delighted that they have found a club where they are settled and one that recognises the development work that Luton Town have put in over the last five years.

'Their family has a strong footballing background with older brother Ryan playing as a professional here at Kenilworth Road and father Trevor also a very talented player in the past.

'We never like to lose talented players from the club, but if players are unsettled and wish to look elsewhere, and the deal is right for all parties, then it is the most sensible way to progress.

'We would like to thank Chelsea for the professional manner in which they have conducted themselves and wish the boys the very best for their ongoing careers.'
