Accused Italian killer Raffaele Sollecito was seen taking his current girlfriend to the Perugia home where British exchange student Meredith Kercher was murdered in 2007.

Sollecito and new squeeze Greta Menagaldo were seen on the property Thursday evening despite the badboy being found guilty of murder and being sentenced to 25 years in prison, according to The Local.

Sollecito is free while his verdict is being appealed, and was most recently found suspiciously at a hotel on the country’s border with Austria, according to reports.

The questionable move surely outraged many, including one local who told the paper he ‘couldn’t believe it.

When I saw them up close, it was Sollecito,’ the man insisted.

The convicted killer’s father saw nothing wrong with the brazen visit.

‘If Raffaele wanted to show his girlfriend the ordeal he went through, I can't see anything wrong with that,’ Sollecito’s father told the paper.

He further insisted that his twice-convicted son ‘has absolutely nothing to do with that crime.’

Killed: Meredith Kercher was found stabbed to death in the home

Where it happened: The Perugia home where Kercher was found dead

The Italian and American exchange student Amanda Knox were convicted of murder in a sensational trial of killing Kercher along with bartender Rudy Guede.

Knox was set free on appeal and fled to the United States vowing not return no matter the outcome of her appeal.

‘Foxy Knoxy,’ as the press referred to her, faces 28 years and six months behind bars.

Both maintain their innocence and vow to exhaust all possible appeals.
