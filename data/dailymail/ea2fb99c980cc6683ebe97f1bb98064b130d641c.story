A badger has been 'causing hysteria' among girls at a grammar school

A badger has been ‘causing hysteria’ among girls at a grammar school.

At a recent assembly at Folkestone School for Girls in Kent, pupils were advised not to approach the badger.

Described as a 'giant', the animal has been spotted sniffing around classrooms, disrupting lessons and reportedly scaring the 'living daylights' out of pupils.

The mother of one of the 1,048 girls 
at the school believes the creature may have been disturbed in its sett 
in the grounds by construction work.

She said: 'It has been spotted several times within the grounds, scaring the living daylights out of the teenage girls.'

The presence of the animal was brought up at a recent school assembly where the 1,048 grammar school girls were advised not to approach their wild visitor.

On one occasion, the badger was spotted underneath a mobile classrooms and all the pupils were told to close the windows and not to leave until it was safe.

The mother said: 'There were tales of it charging at a pupil and then sniffing her, but these are teenage girls who are full of drama. It is a giant badger and it is causing hysteria.'

She said a second badger had been seen at the school last Thursday night, adding: 'I hope the giant badger and the others are captured humanely and moved as the school might start getting concerned about pupil safety,' she said.

'Some pupils are saying they are now too scared to walk past certain parts of the site in case a badger runs out and bites them.' School management confirmed it had received reports of an apparently disorientated badger wandering near school buildings on one occasion.

It was observed and accompanied back to its sett by site staff and has not been seen since.

School principal Tracy Luke said: 'We do have a badger sett in the school grounds, well away from school buildings.' She said a member of staff did mention the badger incident to pupils, asking them to let staff know if they saw a badger and suggesting that they should not approach it.

A spokesman for the Romney Marsh Countryside Project, said that badgers are harmless.He said: 'Badgers are not aggressive. They are actually very shy creatures.

'It is however, unusual to see them in the day.' He added: 'If a badger is seen in daytime more than once then it may be unwell and it is best to call the RSPCA.'

The government is starting a cull of badgers in trial areas to combat bovine TB, aiming to reduce local populations by up to 70 per cent.

Trial killings are due to begin in Gloucestershire and Somerset next month.

But protesters say this will do little to help reduce the disease and are instead calling for vaccination for both badgers and cattle.
