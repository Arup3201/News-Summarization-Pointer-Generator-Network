Education Secretary Michael Gove said opponents of planning reform undermine social mobility

Opponents of planning reforms are undermining social mobility, aspiration and the family by helping to keep home ownership ‘the preserve of those with wealth’, Michael Gove said last night.

In an attack on Nimbys – ‘Not In My Back Yard’ protesters opposing housebuilding plans near their homes – the Education Secretary insisted that property ownership was ‘the foundation of a free society’.

Insisting Britain needed ‘many, many more’ houses, he warned that the proportion of first-time buyers who do not rely on financial assistance from their families or others had crashed from 69 per cent in 2005 to 34 per cent in 2011.

‘No-one who believes in social mobility, in aspiration, in pro-family policies, in thrift and in freedom can be anything other than delighted by the release of more land for housebuilding,’ he said.

His remarks came in a speech that roamed well beyond his education brief amid increasing suggestions from Conservative MPs that he is a potential successor to David Cameron.

On Wednesday, appearing before MPs, Mr Gove described himself as an ‘heir to Tony Blair’ which only fuelled speculation.

His aides denied the remarks were any kind of leadership bid, saying he had been talking in the context of schools reform.

But Nick Clegg hit out at Mr Gove for speculating about his position as leader of the Liberal Democrats, telling LBC radio: ‘Michael, who I think is a perfectly nice chap, doesn’t know the first thing about the (Lib Dems)... of course, he knows a thing or two about leadership ambitions, but that’s a different matter.’

However, the Education Secretary, who insists he will not run in any future leadership contest, cast himself more as the Government’s latter-day answer to Sir Keith Joseph, the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism.

Mr Gove said Sir Keith’s involvement in reform of healthcare, repair of the welfare system, expansion of home ownership and attempt to improve state education over his ministerial career were reflected in an ‘uncanny’ way in the principal aims of Conservatives in today’s government.

He said the ‘animating mission’ of the Conservative Party was ‘the determination to ensure all our citizens have the chances to live fulfilled lives’.

He said people who oppose undeveloped land, such as this village green in Alfriston, East Sussex, being used for house building do not believe in 'aspiration or pro-family policies'

‘We are fighting to make opportunity more equal, and to ensure that every citizen enjoys the dignity, autonomy and freedom which allow them to become truly fulfilled,’ he added.

Mr Gove said the Government’s reforms of the bloated welfare state, the education system to give heads and parents more power and the NHS to put patients and doctors in charge were all about ‘giving every individual a solid stake in our society’.

He said his greatest concern in education was ‘the forgotten 40 per cent’ of children who had become known as ‘the tail - the underachievers concentrated in areas of disadvantage’.

‘England is one of the most unequal nations in the developed world in terms of educational achievement,’ he said.

‘Just five schools - four independent and one sixth-form college in Cambridge - get more students into Oxbridge than 2,000 state schools and colleges put together.

'More boys get to Oxbridge from Eton alone than from the entire cohort of children - 100,000 or so - eligible for free school meals.

‘Our reforms are explicitly targeted at ending this scandal.’

Gove said people should not think about 'losing some undeveloped land' but creating something of 'grace'

Mr Gove said a pupil premium - investment rising to £2.5 billion by next year - directed funds towards the poorest children to raise their attainment.

The Government’s academies and free schools programme, allowing schools to free themselves from state control, was allowing ‘visionaries with a commitment to the highest possible standards... to transform the lives of our poorest children’.

Mr Gove also launched a staunch defence of the City and warned against ‘clumsy and ill thought-out interventions’ by Brussels to impose new rules on the nation’s economic powerhouse.

‘It has become fashionable to criticise the City and its workers, deprecate bankers and bash banks, look askance at financial services and look down on those whose trade is in money,’ he said.

‘And certainly, given the behaviour of a number of egregiously greedy and foolishly reckless individuals, there had to be a change - of culture, attitude and regulation in the City.

‘That is why George Osborne is introducing comprehensive banking reform - not to punish the city, but to protect an institution tarnished by a series of terrible errors.

‘But we would be making a grave historic error if we were to allow a determination to cleanse the stables to harden into a prejudice against those individuals and institutions we need to win in the global race.’
