@SarahTheDuchess: ‘Forgiveness comes when we have the chance to see it as a learning curve and move forward with knowledge ... forgiving ourselves’

The Duchess of York has sent a string of cryptic tweets seemingly talking about her past ‘recklessness’.

Prince Andrew’s former wife, who in 2010 was filmed by the News of the World allegedly offering to sell access to her ex-husband for £500,000, wrote on the social media network yesterday: ‘Sometimes we look back at our life, dropping our jaw at our stupid recklessness.’

One minute later the former royal, who tweets under the name @SarahTheDuchess, wrote: ‘Forgiveness comes when we have the chance to see it as a learning curve and move forward with knowledge, also forgiving ourselves.’

Friends were last night puzzled at the timing of the messages to her 78,728 followers, but one said: ‘She is in a good place at the moment. She has clearly got her life back together after the events of recent years.’

The Duchess endured a roller coaster ride – often of her own making - as a member of the Royal Family following her marriage to the Queen’s son in 1986.

After being caught having her toes sucked by her ‘financial advisor’ John Bryan, the pair were forced to divorce in 1996.

A furious Princess Margaret wrote to her say: ‘You have done more to bring shame on the Royal Family than could ever have been imagined. Not once have you hung your head in embarrassment, even for a minute.

‘Clearly you have never considered the damage you are doing us all. How dare you discredit us?’

Having walked away with a relatively paltry divorce settlement of just £300,000, matters became worse, however, as Sarah’s profligate spending saw her run up £4 million in debts with the Queen’s bank, Coutts.

The scandal saw the Duchess forced to take on a string of work commitment and endorsements in the US, including a lucrative deal with WeightWatchers, cashing in on the own difficult relationship with food.

Her hard work saw her become a wealthy woman in the her own right but in 2006 Sarah’s finances took another battering after a US company set up to capitalise on her image in the US collapsed owing more than £1 million.

Facing bankruptcy and a string of county court cases over her new set of debts, she found herself caught up in the tabloid sting.

Four years later, however, her debts have been paid off – largely with the help of Prince Andrew, with whom she still lives at his official residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor – and she has lost more than two stone in weight.

She is now, say sources close to the Duchess, flying to New York once a month on a new project she is working on which is looking to tackle obesity as well as working on a film project about Prince Albert.

‘I’m not sure whether these tweets directly refer to her personal situation, but the Duchess is doing well. She has lost weight in a sensible way and has a great deal of business projects and charitable initiatives on the go,’ they said. 

‘She is looking to the future not the past.’
