Britain’s most tattooed man - who sports a Jeremy Kyle tattoo on the back of his head - has had a 3D silicone skull implanted in his chest after a three-hour operation.

Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite - a man from Birmingham known as Mathew Whelan before changing his name in 2009 - paid £350 for the cosmetic surgery, and admitted that it hurt.

The 34-year-old had the silicone-filled ball, sporting a raised skull motif, pushed into his chest - and in time, flesh will tighten round the lump, giving the impression of a head pushing through his skin.

It is the latest procedure undertaken 
by a man who has spent £30,000 to be inked from head to foot. He has 
also undergone scarification - a form of facial branding - and had his 
left eyeball tattooed.

Mr 
Body Art - who now goes by the nickname Bart - said that it will be a 
year before the skull can be seen beneath his chest, adding: ‘It just 
looks like a lump at the moment.

He
 admitted that he needed help with the pain during the operation. 
‘Tribes go through a lot of pain,’ Mr Body Art said. ‘You have a choice 
of a numbing ointment, but I started out without it.

‘The
 incision wasn't too bad. I found it therapeutic in one way. But when 
they started to do the channelling, that was more of an ordeal.’

That, he said, is when he needed 
the ointment. Mr Body Art admitted that there are risks - and his body could
 reject the foreign body stuffed inside it.

He had his first tattoo at the age of 16 - a simple bulldog on his right arm. But even at infant school, he craved body art.

‘I
 fell in love with the Maori culture at the age of nine,’ he said. 
‘People call it an obsession, but it has become a lifestyle.’

Mr
 Body Art vowed that he would never regret the work that adorns his 
body, but has recently undergone laser surgery to have some tattoos 
removed.

However, that is only so he has some bare
 flesh for new tattoos. ‘It's like a picture hanging at your home,’ he 
said. You get bored with it and want a different one.’

He underwent the latest body art procedure at ‘body modification studio’ Birmingham Ink.

'I wanted to do something special, so I got the tattoo before I went on the show. The audience loved it and gave me a round of applause. Jeremy Kyle said "That’s very nice"'

Mr Body Art appeared on his favourite TV programme The Jeremy Kyle Show three years ago for a discussion about discrimination.

He said at the time: 'I wanted to do something special, so I got the tattoo before I went on the show. The audience loved it and gave me a round of applause. Jeremy Kyle said "That’s very nice".'

In February, MailOnline reported how Mr Ink-Ite had been refused a passport because of his unusual name, which he adopted by deed poll four years ago.

The Liberal Democrat activist, who has covered 90 per cent of his body in ink, said it breached his human rights to demand that he uses his birth name on his passport.
