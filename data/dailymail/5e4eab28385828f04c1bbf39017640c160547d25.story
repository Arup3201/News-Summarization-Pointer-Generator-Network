An aspiring rapper from Boston facing charges he tried to swindle a fund set up for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing is suing police for misconduct.

Branden ‘The Real Soulja Boy’ Mattier, 23, from Boston, claims the Massachusetts State Police set him up ‘through police misconduct’ when they charged him last year with trying to scam more than $2million from The One Fund.

The South End lyricist is representing himself and seeking $100,000 in damages in the civil suit filed December 23, the Boston Herald reported.

The suit comes after both Mr Mattier and brother Domunique Grice, 28, were accused by the MSP of trying to con almost $2.2million from the fund after filing a claim using the name of a dead aunt under the guise of her losing her legs in the attack.

The duo even attended a dinner for victims and their families, the Herald noted.

In a scene straight of a movie, police teamed up with FedEx to snag the brothers by having an undercover trooper dress as a FedEx employee July 2 to hand deliver the fake check.

FedEx is also named as a defendant in the misconduct suit.

They had scheduled an appointment to test drive a Mercedes Benz later that afternoon in anticipation of their $2.194million bounty, they instead took a ride to the local state police barracks.

Mr Mattier pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to commit a crime, conspiracy and identity fraud, court records showed. He pleaded not guilty in September.

The unemployed wordsmith was freed on $10,000 bail, must wear a GPS monitoring bracelet at all times and is not permitted to leave the state of Massachusetts.

His next court date is Monday.
