The suspected murderer who hotfooted it from a New York City station house this week during a trip to the precinct's restroom has been apprehended by police hiding on the lam in a friend's city apartment.

NYPD officers and Regional Fugitive Task Force officials arrested Brandon Santana, 24, without incident at a friend's Bronx abode 3:15pm Friday, or about 37 hours after he escaped from Brooklyn's 78th Precinct House.

The New York Post reports Santana is wanted for fatally bludgeoning Alexander Santiago, a 22-year-old dad-to-be, with a lead pipe during a gang assault in Brooklyn in 2010.

'It’s like they gave us justice, then 
took it away,' Anaisa Santiago, the victim's 15-year-old sister 
reportedly said prior to the collar.

Santana was originally arrested 
Wednesday after reportedly making an ill-fated return to the city from 
Iowa, where he had been hiding with a relative prior to this week.

Victim: Alex Santiago, here with his fiancee Stephanie, was fatally beaten and stabbed in 2010.

But after a night of questioning by 
cops at the 78th Precinct in Brooklyn's Park Slope section on Wednesday,
Santana escaped from the station house early Thursday morning.

He reportedly shoved an officer to the
floor when the cop opened his cell door so he could make his way to the
precinct's bathroom. Santana, who was reportedly not wearing handcuffs,
then dashed out the precinct's door and into the night.

The Post reports one officer who was 
manning the precinct's front desk jumped over the desk in a bid to 
collar the fleeing Santana, but wound up hurting himself in the process.

A lieutenant also reportedly gave chase after the absconding suspect, but couldn’t catch up, sources told the paper.

After Santana’s latest arrest on 
Friday, Santiago’s girlfriend, Stephanie Mercado, told The Post, 'I hope
the cops keep him tight, and don't let him get away.

'No bathroom breaks this time,' 
Mercado reportedly added. 'And now that they have him we want them to 
get the rest of the cowards. I want justice.'
