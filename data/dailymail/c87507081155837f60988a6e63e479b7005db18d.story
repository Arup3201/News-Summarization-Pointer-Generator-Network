Tyson Fury believes his long absence from the ring will serve him well when he finally gets to face Dereck Chisora at London's ExCeL Arena on November 29.

Fury has fought just four low-key rounds in the last 18 months after seeing prospective bouts against both Chisora and David Haye scrapped or postponed due to late-notice injuries to his opponents.

But, far from fearing another disappointment as he enters the final build-up to their British and European heavyweight title showdown, Fury is intent on seeking out positives.

Fury says he has returned to camp five pounds under his  normal fighting weight 

Fury told Press Association Sport: 'I have had a lot of back-to-back camps recently and it meant I came into this camp with no weight to lose.

'I usually start off two or three stones over the limit and am killing myself to get the weight off, but for this camp I was actually five pounds under my normal fighting weight.

'This camp has been different and we will see on the night if it pays off but I'm looking forward to getting in there and getting the win that will move me towards some world title fights.'

Fury shrugged off suggestions his previous crushing disappointments could have any negative impact on his career as he looks to close in on the likes of Wladimir Klitschko.

'I'm always focused when it comes to fighting because it is what keeps me alive - it is something I was born to do.

'There is no question of not being focused, whatever happens. If I wasn't training and boxing and going forward to a fight, I don't know what kind of state I'd be in.

'I'd probably be a crazy person in the streets. I certainly wouldn't be someone I'd want to bump into. 

You have to be a crazy person to fight me when I'm in this sort of mood and Dereck Chisora is definitely a crazy one.'
