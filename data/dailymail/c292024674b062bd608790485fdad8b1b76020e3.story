The reward for information in the murder of a mother-of-two has been raised to $36,000 today as investigators continue to hunt for her killer.

Connie Murray, 46, was strangled and her body dumped in a park during her routine evening jog on Monday night at 9pm in Philadelphia. 

Police investigators returned to Pennypack Park on Friday morning to continue to search for clues where her body was found. A motive for the killing has not been found and police are unsure whether it was a targeted or random attack.

The married mother-of-two, from Holme Circle, was found dead in a Philadelphia cemetery on Tuesday morning. Her smartphone and earphones have not been found.

An autopsy revealed she had been strangled. The married mother was not sexually assaulted but bruising showed that a minor struggle had taken place.

The reward fund was raised in a joint effort by the City of Philadelphia, Citizens Crime Commission, Fraternal Order of Police and Philadelphia Federal Credit Union.

Mrs Murray's devastated family - husband Christopher and daughters Elizabeth and Emily - have yet to make a public statement. 

A large gathering of friends and family, including her two young daughters, were seen embracing each other outside the Murray home on Wednesday.

A family friend, Colleen Gass told the TV station that Mrs Murray's sister had asked her to share a safety message. 

She told NBC 10: 'Her sister wanted me to tell everyone not to wear earbuds while running. The whole reason she thinks her sister was attacked was because she didn't hear him coming. She had her earbuds in.'

Philadelphia homicide Captain James Clark warned women who were walking and jogging in the park not do so alone.  

Mrs Murray was a member of the Crispin Gardens Athletic Club which is located in the park where she was found dead. Local residents have been left stunned in the leafy, suburban community.

'I’m back here all the time, I know this area really well and it’s just really sad that something like this happened here,' said Paul Schlear to CBS 3.

'Someone very sick and deranged had to do something like that. I just hope they catch them.'
