JOSE MOURINHO HAS WRECKED ASHLEY COLE'S ENGLAND CAREER

JENKINSON, GAYLE AND WICKHAM DESERVE ENGLAND RECOGNITION

For years and years Manchester City fans knew nothing about trophies. Odd-shaped silver things that never came anywhere near Maine Road.

And then Shiekh Mansour arrived with billions of pounds and he was ready to pump endless stacks of cash into the club. Good luck to him and his club I say.

If he’s prepared to spend big, put money into football and make City fans happy at the same time – why not? The control freaks at UEFA need to wind their necks in and deal with bigger issues in the game.

Just the start: Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy after Manchester City beat West Ham on Sunday to win the title by two points

Next level: Kompany and City manager Manuel Pellegrini must now conquer Europe in 2014-2015

Investment return: Sheikh Mansour (second right) expects a constant stream of silverware for the millions he has pumped into the club

Winning trophies wouldn’t be the difficult part – Pellegrini was gifted £100m worth of players last summer, and not all of them regulars in the starting line-up.

That’s a lot of garnish alongside the already brilliant players including this season’s true stars Aguero, Silva, Toure, Hart, Dzeko and Kompany.

You’ve got to be pretty useless not to win silverware with the current City squad.

The difficult part for Sheikh Mansour is raising the expectations of City fans. They are stuck in their old ways: they didn’t want Roberto Mancini to go after he had won a title and an FA Cup – he was still a hero to the supporters. Never mind that he’d completely lost the dressing room. 

The fans held the Capital One Cup aloft like it was something revered in Abu Dhabi. If Sheikh Mansour was excited about it when they beat Sunderland at Wembley, a little bit of research would reveal last year’s final was between Swansea and Bradford.

Just the beginning: Pellegrini's first piece of silverware was the League Cup in March, but this trophy is bottom of City's priority list

Warning signs: Roberto Mancini was sacked after failing to win a trophy last season

Fair to say the League Cup might excite the success-starved City fans trying to make up for all those lost years after Dennis Tuert’s overhead kick, but it’s not why the billions are being pumped in. Winning that trophy was almost embarrassing for a mega-rich club like City.

No, the owners made it clear when they arrived they want to be “winning in Europe.” The Champions League is everything to the Sheikh, along with the kudos of being accepted at the same table as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.

Domestic domination is seen as inevitable for Manchester City by Abu Dhabi. The managers they appoint will be judged by what they achieve in Europe, and to that end, Manuel Pellegrini failed this season.

Domination: Manchester City's owners want to emulate the achievements of Bayern Munich at home and abroad

Not bad: Manuel Pellegrini and Yaya Toure size up the Premier League trophy during Man City's open-top bus parade on Monday

I’m not saying he’s about to get the chop – far from it. But he should be aware that 18 months before Mancini was sacked, the owner had declared that his manager was on “the right path” and it would “take time” as City were heading out of the Champions League.

There is nothing wrong with City fans, who have been United’s embarrassing inferior little brother for decades, enjoying every piece of success and silverware their club gives them, and waving it all right in front of every United fan’s face.

But the owners set a higher standard than a League Cup and another Premier League title.

They want European domination for Manchester City. Anything less is failure.
