Rocky and Rickina are best friends. As they pile into the school bus on their way to morning lessons, they're playfighting and planning mischief... as they always do.

These carefree kids are no different from millions of children the world over - except that they're orangutans, their bus is a red wheelbarrow, and their school features the most unusual lessons you'll ever see, thanks to a National Geographic programme called Orangutan Rescue: Back To The Wild.

First item on the curriculum, as the wheelbarrow deposits a gaggle of baby apes at the forest's edge in West Kalimantan, Borneo, is tree-climbing. Rickina is becoming an expert, but Rocky can't seem to get the hang of it and clings to his pal instead.

Rocky and Rickina are part of the Animal Rescue project, where orphaned apes are taught the skills they'll need to survive in the wild

His weight drags her down, and they land in a jumble. Shaking twigs and leaves out of their fur, the terrible twosome move on to the next lesson - learning how to get at the porridge and honey hidden in tree trunks. But there's chaos again as two other students, Joyce and Gunung, decide to go playing in the trees that are out of bounds, further into the forest.

It's all in a day's work at the International Animal Rescue project, where orphaned apes are taught the skills they'll need to survive in the wild.

Like the human education system, the orangutan school is divided into primary, secondary and college levels. Rocky, Rickina and friends are on the first rung, but in three or four years they'll be ready to tackle more challenging lessons in nest-building and other forest skills vital for survival.

Project director Karmele Llana Sanchez says the girl apes learn faster and make better progress. The boys are naughtier and much more boisterous, especially from the age of seven or so, and more likely to give the human handlers a playful nip from their powerful jaws.

One young female called Joyce is top of the class at making treetop nests, weaving branches and fronds into a snug basket that will keep her safe through the night. But as she finishes her handiwork, a bigger lad rudely turfs her out and commandeers it for himself. Bullying is a problem in this school as at all others.

When the orangutans are ready for independent living, perhaps aged ten, they are transferred to ape university - a jungle island surrounded by a moat that has been carved out by mechanical diggers. Volunteers monitor their progress and ensure they have enough food as they build up to graduation day... and release into the wild.

The importance of this school can't be overstated. Orangutans are desperately endangered as their habitat is obliterated to make way for palm oil plantations, logging and mining for resources such as coal and bauxite - an aluminium ore.

Once there were half a million apes, but just a few thousand survive today. As the forests are chopped down, adult orangutans are slaughtered, and babies are illegally sold as pets. It's a brutal trade - Rickina has a scar across her scalp from the machete that killed her mother.

Orangutans have the longest adolescence of any animal beside ourselves, and they learn their life skills from their mothers. So it's a daunting but crucial task for the human volunteer schoolteachers, such as Lisa Burtenshaw from Bath.

Lisa sold her contract-cleaning business to work at the centre for seven months a year, often joined by her husband, stand-up comedian Noel Britten. One of her jobs is devising new ways of secreting food around the forest for her students to find.

'We call that "enrichment",' she says. 'Rather than giving them food out of our hands or from bowls, we encourage natural behaviours, making them climb and forage.'

Sadly, not all the apes can ever hope to return to the wild. Some may have become too reliant on people, or have suffered injuries in captivity - such as Monte, the centre's biggest inhabitant, an adult male whose legs withered during years chained inside a tiny cage. Monte might never walk again, but he has an active mind.

Lisa dreams up food puzzles for him to crack, boxes to prise open and knots to unravel in search of a grape or peanut. It's the ape equivalent of sudoku. 'Orangutans are so intelligent they get bored easily,' Lisa says. 'They get stagnant sitting around in a cage all day, so this helps them stay mentally active and keeps their natural instincts alive.'

Workers must wear masks at all times to prevent human diseases from infecting the apes. They are not allowed to cuddle the babies either, and it's not just the risk of sickness.

Orangutans are not natural huggers, because in the treetops they need both hands for holding on to branches. Instead, the babies cling to their mothers until they are confident enough to let go.

When humans hug and cradle them, the orangutans lose the instinct to cling - and that could be fatal later on.

'They're very lazy,' laughs Lisa, 'and they'll take the easy option. Even if one is crying in baby school, we don't pick it up - instead, we give it to one of the other orangutans. It's really important that they know they're orangutans, not humans. From a young age they all crave companionship, and they buddy up quite quickly. We encourage strong friendships.'

That's why Rocky and Rickina are allowed to carry on causing mayhem together, when human children might be separated. And it's why the wheelbarrow is so important - the apes can cling to each other as it bumps along the forest trail.

But on the journey home, it's sometimes a different story. Too tired after a day's study to clamber back into their one-wheeled bus, some of the babies hitch a ride on a human foot... wrapping their arms round a teacher's leg as they bounce home. Even for these adorable bundles of fur, school really is hard work.
