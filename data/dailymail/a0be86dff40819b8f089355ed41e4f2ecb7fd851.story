Thousands of mothers risk falling pregnant this Christmas because they are so rushed off their feet they forget to take the Pill.

The number of births in England and Wales peaks every year nine months after winter, which has been linked to couples conceiving as the nights draw in.

But it has been claimed that some women who already have children will be so busy preparing for the festive season that they will forget to take precautions leading to a rise in unplanned pregnancies.

Official figures show births peak in July, August, September and October, nine months after the winter months

Last year more children were born in July, September, October and November – nine months after the previous winter.

By contrast, February and April saw the fewest births, according to officials figures.

The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas), which offers abortions, said it expects a rise in demand in the coming weeks as a result of "contraceptive slip-ups during the festive party season".

Clare Murphy, of bpas, told MailOnline: “Many women are at risk of unplanned pregnancy over the busy festive period. We see more women in the first months of the New Year for advice about unplanned pregnancy than any other time of the year.

‘Many unintended conceptions become much wanted pregnancies, so it is no surprise that September, nine months on, is one of the busiest months of the year for births. For other women however, starting the New Year with an unplanned pregnancy can be a cause for considerable distress.’

She said that while ‘boozy Christmas parties’ could be to blame for some unplanned pregnancies, others are the result of mothers being too busy to take precautions.

Miss Murphy added: ‘We see many older women who are simply rushed off their feet at Christmas and forgot to pick up contraceptive supplies or missed a pill.

‘We see thousands of women in their 30s and 40s in January and February, the majority of whom are already mothers, who were so busy getting ready for a family Christmas that their own needs got forgotten.

‘We urge women not to forget about themselves, get their contraception sorted out in advance and know that if they do have an accident there are now forms of emergency contraception that can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex.’

The most births in 2013 were in July, a total of 61,422, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Most of those would have been conceived over October and November.

The other months with the highest number of births were October (60, 519), September (60,289) and August (60,238) - corresponding to conceptions between November and February.
