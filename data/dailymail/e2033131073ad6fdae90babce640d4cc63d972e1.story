The same strain of killer bacteria that caused the Black Death and 
spread around the world in the mid 1800s may have helped finish off the 
Roman Empire, researchers have claimed.

DNA analyses of skeletal remains of plague victims from the 6th century AD found traces of  Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, has already been 
linked with at least two of the most devastating pandemics in recorded 
history.

Now researchers believe it also caused the Justinianic Plague of the sixth to eighth centuries, which killed 
more than 100 million people - and some historians believe contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire.

The Plague of Justinian (AD 541–542) was a pandemic that afflicted the Eastern Roman Empire, including its capital Constantinople.

At its peak, 5,000 people per day in Constantinople died from it, killing half the population.

From there, the plague moved east and west, becoming antiquity's most 
lethal known pandemic.

Half a century after it began, between 25 million
 and 100 million in Europe and Asia had died.

The plague's social and cultural impact during the Justinian period has been compared to that of the Black Death.

Some historians say the damage was so great to the Persian and Byzantine
 empires that it made them vulnerable to the Muslim conquests of the 
next century.

However, while it has been claimed as one of the greatest plagues in history, but until now researchers have not know  what form of plague it was.

The Great Plague, which lasted from the 14th to 17th centuries, 
included the infamous epidemic known as the Black Death, which may have 
killed nearly two-thirds of Europe in the mid-1300s.

The Modern Plague struck around the world in the 19th and 20th 
centuries, beginning in China in the mid-1800s and spreading to Africa, 
the Americas, Australia, Europe and other parts of Asia.

However, until now researchers have been unsure whether it was also responsible for the  Justinianic Plague.

At its peak, 5,000 people per day in Constantinople died from it, killing half the population.

Some historians say the damage was so great to the Persian and Byzantine
 empires that it made them vulnerable to the Muslim conquests of the 
next century.

The latest study was led by Holger C. Scholz and Michaela Harbeck of the Palaeogenetics Group at the Institute 
of Anthropology at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.

'For a long time scholars from different disciplines have intensively
 discussed about the actual etiological agents of the past pandemics', 
said Dr. Barbara Bramanti, who also worked on the research.

'Only ancient DNA analyses carried out on skeletal remains of plague victims could finally conclude the debate.'

Dr Bramanti also headed the international team which demonstrated 
beyond any doubt that Y. pestis also caused the second pandemic of the 
14th-17th centuries including the Black Death, the infamous epidemic 
that ravaged Europe from 1346-1351.

To help solve the mystery, scientists analysed ancient DNA from the
 teeth of 19 different sixth-century skeletons from a medieval graveyard
 in Bavaria, Germany, of people who apparently succumbed to the 
Justinianic Plague.

They say the results, published last 
week in PloS Pathogens, 'Confirmed unambiguously that Y. pestis was 
indeed the causing agent of the first pandemic, in contrast to what has 
been postulated by other scientists recently.

The researchers said these findings confirm that the Justinianic Plague crossed the Alps, killing people in what is now Bavaria.

However, they admit they still are not sure how many strain of the plague were responsible for the deaths.

'It remains questionable whether at the time of the Byzantine Emperor 
Justinian only one strain or more were disseminated in Europe, as it was
 at the time of the Black Death," said Dr Bramant.

The researchers now hope to reconstruct the whole genome sequence of the
 plague strain in these ancient teeth to learn more about the disease.
