The mother of a 15-year-old choirgirl who was stabbed to death by a jealous ex-boyfriend says she feels 'vindicated' after an inquest heavily criticised the police.

Arsema Dawit was knifed more than 50 times by Thomas Nugusse in central London in June 2008, just three days after her 15th birthday.

Her family had reported him to the police around five weeks before Arsema died, saying he had threatened to assault and kill her, but they did not feel their concerns were taken seriously enough.

A jury at Southwark Coroner's Court today returned a verdict of unlawful killing and branded the police investigation ‘inadequate’.

In a statement outside the court, Arsema's mother Tsehaynesh Medihani said she found it a comfort that people now knew her daughter's life could have been saved if the police had acted.

She said: 'I have waited six long years for other people to find out the truth about the circumstances surrounding my daughter's tragic death.

'This case is not simply about a brutal and unforgivable murder, but why, despite me begging the police to save my daughter, the police failed to act.

'The jury, by their conclusions, have vindicated me and what I have been saying from the very beginning.'

Arsema's family won the right to a full inquest  in 2012, two years after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found 'organisational failings' in the police's handling of the case

Mrs Medihani added: 'My beautiful Arsema had a great future ahead of her and big ambitions. We left a war zone and came to this country where I thought my children would be safe.

'Arsema was a loving daughter and sister. She was assaulted, harassed and terrorised by Thomas Nugusse, a man the police were informed was in his late 20s or early 30s.

'The police did nothing to stop Thomas Nugusse from carrying out his threats to kill Arsema just three days after her 15th birthday.

'I have had an agonising four weeks reliving the nightmare of those last few weeks of my daughter's life.

'While the pain and loss of my daughter will never go away, I can take some comfort from the fact that the public now know the truth that Arsema's death was avoidable and that her life could have been saved if the police had acted.'

Nugusse, who was 21 at the time of the killing, had met Arsema at St Michael’s Orthodox Church in Camberwell, south London, where they were both in the choir.

After dating for two years Arsema broke up with Nugusse because of his jealous and controlling tendencies.

In April 2008 he hit her in the face, leaving her with a black eye, for greeting a male school friend at McDonald’s.

Nugusse then started stalking Arsema, sending threatening messages to her and her family.

He texted her mother to say: ‘It doesn’t matter what you guys do, I’m going to find her anyway’. 

CCTV captured Nugusse leaving the block of flats moments after he killed Arsema.

He disposed of his bloodstained long-sleeved t-shirt and made a 999 call from the Hungerford Bridge.

During the chilling call Nugusse said: 'Okay I want to tell you that I, I had a fight with my girlfriend and I killed my girlfriend so, this is because of... because she cheating me, she had been with me, she been with me for two years.'

Following her death the case was immediately referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), and an investigation was put on hold to allow for criminal proceedings.

But the family were robbed of the chance of a full trial for Nugusse after he was left brain damaged when he attempted suicide in prison shortly after killing Arsema, meaning he was unfit to plead.

An Old Bailey jury in May 2009 was not permitted to return conventional innocent or guilty verdicts and instead found that Nugusse had “committed the acts”.

Arsema’s family made a formal complaint against the Metropolitan Police in July 2009, accusing the force of ignoring warnings that Nugusse was a danger.
