More than a quarter of Scottish voters believe British spies are working to stop the country voting for independence, a new poll has revealed.

Some 26 per cent of Scots think it is ‘probably true’ the security services are working to protect the union ahead of the referendum on 18 September.

The findings illustrate the growing divide between Scotland and Westminster which is fuelling the 'Yes'  campaign for independence.

Scottish voters are increasingly distrustful of Westminster politicians, a new YouGov poll has revealed

Scottish voters trust politicians based in Holyrood, Edinburgh, more than those based in Westminster

Many Scots do not believe warnings from UK politicians that the country would be blocked from using the pound. SNP leader Alex Salmond has dismissed the threat as a bluff.

A poll published by YouGov this weekend showed voters overwhelmingly mistrust David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

Just under three quarters of Scots said they did not trust what the Prime Minister said about independence. Seven in 10 voters north of the border meanwhile do not trust the Labour leader.

Alex Salmond’s trust ratings are much higher. The Scottish First Minister is trusted by four in 10 Scots.

The level of distrust is exposed by the latest YouGov poll, published by the website Buzzfeed, asking Scots about underhand tactics by the UK Government to sabotage the referendum.

The poll questioned the same 1,084 Scottish individuals from yesterday’s bombshell Sunday Times survey which gave the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign a two point lead.

The poll found almost half of Scots believe the British government is hiding new oil reserves found in the North Sea during the referendum campaign.

Alex Salmond has claimed that new technology could release an extra £600billion worth of oil, while Better Together says such claims are wildly optimistic.

The survey alsol found 19 per cent of Scots believe the referendum will probably be rigged.

Andrew Parker, the  Director General of MI5, is believed by a quarter of Scots to be campaigning to keep Scotland in the union

Senior Scottish nationalists have previously suggested British spies could engage in a dirty tricks campaign to stop Scotland breaking away from the rest of the UK.

The late Margo MacDonald MSP wrote to the chiefs of Britain’s security services in 2013, urging them not to let their spies interfere in the independence debate.

Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars suggested it is ‘naive’ to imagine MI5 is not taking a role in the independence campaign.
