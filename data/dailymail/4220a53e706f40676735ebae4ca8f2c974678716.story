Not since 1962 has an avalanche in Colorado taken as many lives as the one that struck Saturday. Authorities have now released the names of the five victims of the 600-foot-wide slide.

Clear Creek County Sheriff Don Krueger identified the victims Sunday as Christopher Peters, 32, of Lakewood; Joseph Timlin, 32, of Gypsum; Ryan Novack, 33, of Boulder; Ian Lanphere, 36, of Crested Butte; and Rick Gaukel, 33, of Estes Park.

Another snowboarder, identified by friends as Jerome Boulay, was buried and survived, but authorities have not released his condition.

The sheriff said search and rescue 
crews recovered the men's bodies from a backcountry area on Loveland 
Pass several hours after Saturday afternoon's slide, which was estimated
to be about 600 feet wide and eight feet deep.

All of the men were equipped with avalanche beacons.

The Denver Post reported Sunday the 
group of men, all experienced in extreme terrain, were participating in a
snowboarding event called the Rocky Mountain High Backcountry Bash to 
raise money for the Colorado Avalanche Information Center when the slide
occurred.

Snowboarder Mike Bennett of Dillon 
told the newspaper he dug through hard-packed snow to help free Boulay 
before finding two others buried about two feet below the surface.

'They were wrapped around each other, below a patch of trees,' he said.

Bennett said four of the victims were snowboarders and one was a skier.

Meanwhile, Adam Schmidt, editor in 
chief of Snowboard Colorado Magazine, told The Associated Press the 
event organized by Timlin, 'ironically,' was aimed at promoting 
backcountry safety.

'Joe is really about the snowboarding
community in Colorado,' said Schmidt, whose magazine was an event 
sponsor. 'He really stressed making this event about backcountry safety.
... Unfortunately, if Mother Nature decides to throw something at you, 
you can never be too prepared.'

The slide occurred on a spring 
weekend when many skiers and snowboarders took advantage of late season 
snowfall in the Rocky Mountains. Loveland Pass, which rises to an 
elevation of 11,990 feet about 60 miles west of Denver, is popular among
backcountry skiers and snowboarders, but dangerous conditions are 
common in the area even in the spring.

Ethan Greene, director of the 
Colorado Avalanche Information Center, said a systemic weakness in the 
snowpack was exacerbated by heavy snow that fell on the pass over the 
past week and a half.

'It's been something that's been 
giving us problems all winter,' he said. 'But the snow storms that have 
been coming in this spring have just created a large slab on top of it.'

Forecasters for the avalanche center 
warned skiers and hikers again Sunday of potentially dangerous 
backcountry conditions, saying the new snow has pushed the old snowpack 
to the breaking point.

On Thursday, a 38-year-old 
snowboarder died in an avalanche south of Colorado's Vail Pass. Eagle 
County sheriff's officials said the man and another snowboarder likely 
triggered the slide after a friend on a snowmobile dropped them off at 
the top of Avalanche Bowl.

According to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, 11 people have died in avalanches in Colorado this winter season.

Greene said Saturday's was the 
deadliest in the state since 1962, when seven people were killed in a 
slide that wiped out several homes in the town of Twin Lakes near 
Independence Pass.

U.S. avalanche deaths climbed steeply
after 1990, averaging 24 a year, as new gear became available for 
backcountry travel. Until then, avalanches rarely claimed more than a 
handful of lives each season in records going back to 1950.
