Overgrown and long-forgotten, this pile of twisted metal is the wreckage of Pan Am flight 103 - hidden away in a scrapyard some 25 years after the tragic Lockerbie bombing.

Shrouded from view behind high fences and surrounding trees, the aircraft's distinctive blue and white livery is clearly visible in these aerial photographs.

The remains of the bombed jet were taken to the scrapyard in rural Lincolnshire shortly after the disaster on December 21, 1988, and have lain there ever since.

Wreckage: The 325 tonnes of mangled alumunium alloy can not be moved from the site until all investigations into the tragedy have been completed

The 325 tonnes of mangled alumunium alloy can not be moved from the site until all investigations into the tragedy, which killed 270 people, have been completed, according to the Mirror.

In the aftermath of the crash, some of the wreckage was taken to an Army based in Cumbria, where it was examined by experts, while the mid-section - which felt the full force of the bomb - is being kept by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in Hampshire.

However, most of the remains of the aircraft are being stored at Windley's salvage scrapyard, near Tattershall.

Scene: Rescue workers examine the nose of Pan Am flight 103 in the hours after the explosion on December 21, 1988

The doomed plane was on its way from London to New York when it 
exploded above Lockerbie, in southern Scotland, on the evening of 
December 21 1988, less than an hour after take-off.

Everyone on board the flight was killed, as were 11 people on the ground.

Many of the victims were American college students flying home for Christmas, including 35 Syracuse University students participating in a study abroad program.

The attack, caused by a bomb packed into a suitcase that was smuggled on board, remains the deadliest act of terror in Britain.

Damage: Wrecked houses and a deep gash in the ground caused by the plane when it crashed in the village of Lockerbie

On Saturday, relatives of those killed and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond were among those who gathered for a special memorial service in the town to mark 25 years since the terrorist blast.

Only one man, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was convicted of the bombing in January 2001 and given a life sentence.

However, he was freed in August 2009 under compassionate release ground after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, to the outrage of many of the victims' families.

He died in May last year, although many unanswered questions over who was behind the blast remain.Â
