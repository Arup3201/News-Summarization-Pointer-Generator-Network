A teenager has been told she will not be allowed to compete to become Miss England because she is a single mother.

Dhakirah Salim decided to enter local auditions for the competition in Birmingham only to be told this would not be possible because in the small print it says mothers and married women cannot enter.

The 19-year-old had gone to support her Latifah, 22, who was entering the contest but then decided she would also put herself forward. 

Dhakirah Salim, 19, was told she could not compete for a place in the Miss England competition in the local heats in Birmingham because the rules of the contest ban mothers and married women from taking part 

However the mother-of-one was disappointed when her older sister got to the next round round and she did not. 

She was told this was because she has a daughter Sapphire, three, and there are rules banning mothers taking part.  

'This rule sends out the message that there's no beauty in women after birth and that young mums can't be good role models,' said Miss Salim. 

'I think that's discrimination towards women with babies.' 

The Miss England beauty pageant claims the rule is in place to protect young families because the busy schedule for contest winners is not compatible with having a settled home life.

But critics say it is a choice for each individual candidate to make on whether they feel they have enough time to commit to the role and have blasted the regulations as 'old fashioned and discriminatory.'

Dhakirah is currently studying business administration with the intention of running her own entertainment business. She also works part time. 

'I'm attending college, I do extra-curricular courses and I do a part-time job that I travel around Birmingham and the UK for,' she added. 

'I don't think it's fair that because I have a baby I shouldn't be able to enter the Miss Birmingham contest.

'I do get a lot of negativity about young mothers, and especially the perception of single mothers, but I hope to prove everyone wrong.

'If Sapphire wasn't here right now, I think I would be a different person.

'She makes me feel more positive and gives me the confidence to go out and do things.

'It's a new day and age, but the organisers of the competition don't seem to recognise that.

'They're trying to say women with children can only be housewives. Women should be able to go out there, seize opportunities and create a better life.

'That's the example I want to set my daughter.

'Latifah and I are still very close and if she wins I will be happy for her. We do argue but just about silly things. This hasn't caused any arguments.'

Her older sister Latifah works at Tesco and juggles life as a full-time university student and part-time carer for her mother. 

She failed her first year while she was getting trained to use dialysis machines. 

The sisters, who have five other siblings, were among 637 applicants for the Miss Birmingham crown and 80 were selected for interviews at the Burlington Hotel in the city centre in January.

Angie Beasley, Director of Miss England, said the controversial rule was in place to protect the 'family unit' because of the winner's demanding schedule.

The sisters both competed in the regional heats for Miss England in Birmingham but Latifah Salim (left) got in to the next round of the competition while Dhakirah, 19, was rejected because she is a mother

Miss Salim said she believes the rules banning mothers competing are old fashioned and should be changed 

She said: 'I don't think it's old-fashioned. It's to protect families.

'We don't want to be responsible for splitting a mother up from her children.'

Ms Beasley, who is a mother, added: 'There are other competitions that are less demanding, where ladies who have children should enter.

'I couldn't enter a baby contest because I'm not a baby. I don't fit into those rules. People have challenged this rule before but we are not changing it.'

The rule has led to criticism from previous winners. Last year Kris’ina Jagpal, who wore the coveted sash in 2012, urged organisers to ditch the rules banning mothers and married women.
