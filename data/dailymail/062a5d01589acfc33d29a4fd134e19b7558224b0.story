Manchester United and City fans travelling from the south could soon be able to get to Old Trafford and the Etihad in a little more than an hour on a proposed high-speed rail line from London.

The two-hour trip between London and Manchester currently means supporters have to 'allow for a full day' to get to the match, the project's boss insists.

High Speed 2 chairman Sir David Higgins suggests a new £50billion line would cut the journey time in half for home and away fans coming from the south.

Fans travelling from London for the match between Manchester United and Chelsea risked not getting to Old Trafford in time following travel chaos on Sunday.

'If you knew guaranteed that a train was going to take an hour to get from London to Manchester you could get up for a football game or for a meeting and be back and save the rest of the day,' says Mr Higgins. 

The suggestion comes after United and Chelsea fans travelling from London were almost stranded as trains were suspended and cancelled  hours before kick-off.

United did not delay their 4pm start at Old Trafford despite fans struggling to make it in time.

Those that failed to make the match missed a 94th-minute equaliser from Robin van Persie that salvaged a 1-1 draw against Jose Mourinho's Chelsea after Didier Drogba's opener.
