A baseball fan plucked a flying bat out of the air with one hand saving the child behind her from being hit in the face.

Eileen Depasa's was sitting in the stands near the left-field line when Tyler Flowers lost the handle of his bat. 

Despite sending the bat flying into the stands, the Chicago White Sox fan's quick reflexes meant she effortless grabbed the wooden missile with one hand.

She's got skills! Fan pulls off an unbelievable mid-air baseball bat catch and stops a child from getting hit in the face

She wasn't allowed to keep the bat after the catch but was relieved to save the child sitting behind her with her mother from being hit on the head. 

She told MLB.com: 'I was more concerned with protecting the baby seated behind me.'

However, the same cannot he said about her male companion.

As the bat hurtled towards them, he ducked and covered his head putting his fingers in his ears.

Flowers had the bat retrieved but gave Depesa an autographed bat in return.

'That one in particular, I switched to a new model recently and I don't have a surplus of them,' Flowers said.

'I'm trying to keep as many as I can.'

Although
 he heard news of the catch, Flowers never actually saw it.

He said 
accidently losing your bat coincides with a warm humid day.

'Usually, it's the second or third bat for me, your gloves get a little moist, you are sweating a fair bit.

'On
 top of that, the pine tar becomes more slimy as opposed to sticky. I 
had a feeling when I was on deck. I was starting to go get another pair 
of gloves and possibly a different bat.'

Cole Tyler Flowers, 28, is a professional baseball catcher and infielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball.
