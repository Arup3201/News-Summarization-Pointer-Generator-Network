A pensioner is claiming he has cured himself of diabetes - thanks to two intense 12-minute work outs  a week.

John Hall, 67, of Radford in Coventry, suffered so badly from the condition he was worried it would kill him any minute.

He had been classed as having a high risk of a heart attack or stroke, and it got to the point where his condition was so bad he feared going to sleep in case he failed to wake up.

John Hall, a 67-year-old pensioner from Radford in Coventry has claimed that his intense 12-minute exercise routine twice a week has cured his diabetes and halved his cholesterol

Doctors were stunned when they saw the results of the short bursts of exercise, and have begun to consider weaning him off of his diabetes medication

For seven years the retired Coventry 
City Council officer battled the condition, failing to reduce his 
dangerously high cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels.

He altered his diet and walked five miles a day, but nothing helped his condition.

In
 a last ditch effort he began exercising in two 12-minute bursts a week,
 a fraction of the recommended two and a half hours, but he claims this has turned his life around.

His
 sessions, which take place at his local community centre in Radford, 
consist of warm ups and then a series of high intensity aerobic 
activity.

The programme supports new thinking that short, intense, exercise sessions can be just as beneficial as longer work-out regimes.

Mr Hall joined four months ago in which time his glucose and cholesterol levels, which were nearly double what they should be, have almost halved.

His reduced blood sugar and blood pressure levels have even caused doctors to plan to start weaning him off of his diabetes drugs, and his twice daily blood sugar tests have become only once daily.

The exercises raise Mr Hall's heart rate and have reduced his blood sugar and blood pressure levels

Mr Hall said: 'The exercises might only be for 12 minutes but my metabolism keeps working hard for the next 24 hours.

'I noticed an improvement in the first month.

'When I went back to the doctors two weeks ago, they were absolutely astounded.

'They said ‘what on earth have you been doing?'

'I don’t consider myself to be a diabetic any more.

'I feel free to enjoy my life. I can’t believe the difference in myself.'

Mr Hall was told he had type 2 diabetes the day after his 60th birthday, after complaining of severe tiredness and thirst and being referred for tests.

His declining health culminated with a minor stroke while at work two years ago.

'I felt a strange tingling feeling down my face.

'I felt sort of wobbly, one side of my face started to droop and I couldn’t hold my pen.

'A colleague drove me to my GP and the doctor said you’re not leaving here unless in an ambulance, so I was taken to hospital where I was told I’d suffered a minor stroke, a forewarning to a bigger one.'

The minor stroke caused Hall to take retirement, fearing the stress of work was a contributing factor.

Mr Hall is on an exercise programme called Progressive Accelerating Cardiopulmonary Exersion, or Pace for short.

It is a new programme and has already shown health benefits, such as weight loss and the reversal of type 2 diabetes. It can be achieved by exercising for just 12 minutes two or three times a week.

It starts with a brief warm up and then participants begin stretching, running and jumping - all to raise the heart rate quickly.

The exercises last for 30 seconds each and are followed by a 90-second recovery.

Pace sessions are run by the health and exercise charity More Active Living for Health.
