One of the world's finest collections of Chinese jade is tipped to sell for for £3.1million.

The 15 pieces were acquired by the former Conservative MP Somerset de Chair who left them to his widow, Lady Juliet Tadgell, upon his death in 1995.

Lady Juliet, a heiress, is one of the richest women in Britain and her son-in-law is the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.

Her late husband's magnificent collection of jade is one that is well known within the art world for its sheer quality. 

It includes a 9ins long carved elephant that was made in the 18th century for the Chinese Imperial Court and is likely to have been one of a pair that flanked the imperial throne.

It is said to be worth £640,000. 

There is a 16ins tall imperial jar that dates back to nearly 300 years and is almost identical to one held in the prestigious Palace Museum in China. It is valued at £1.2 million.

Asaph Hyman, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Somerset de Chair bought from some of the finest dealers of the time to amass one of most important collections of Chinese jade in the world, certainly in Europe.

'The quality of the period for when he was collecting was finest available.

'Some of the pieces have been exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and other pieces have not been on the market since the 1960s.

'The collection has passed on to his wife, Lady Juliet.

'It is a choice the family have made to sell them at this time. 

'People are just custodians of this sort of art for a certain period of time before it then moves on to someone else.'

The jade pieces are being sold in Hong Kong tomorrow.
