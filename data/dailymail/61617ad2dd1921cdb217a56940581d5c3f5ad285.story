This is the face of a suspect thief who has allegedly been trawling hospital wards to steal the house keys of elderly patients - and then burgling their homes.

Police say that the middle-aged woman travelled 40 miles and visited three hospitals in just one day to collect a haul of keys which she then used to ransack her unsuspecting victims' unattended homes.

In these shocking CCTV images, she appears to be counting the money from a purse she had snatched from a 98-year-old moments earlier.

Heartless: The middle-aged woman wanted by police is seen leaving a hospital having allegedly stolen elderly patients' keys before burgling their homes

The first pensioner's door key was taken from her handbag while she was being treated on a ward in St George's hospital in Tooting, south London.

At 3pm, witnesses described seeing a woman burgle her flat in Horsham, West Sussex.

Wanted: The woman is described by witnesses as having a cockney accent and tanned or dark skin

At 4.25pm, the same woman was first captured on CCTV at Crawley Hospital where she struck up a conversation with her second elderly victim.

It was only after the woman left that the patient noticed her bag was missing from her bedside.

At 5pm, neighbours confronted a woman leaving the victim's unoccupied home in Furnace Green, using a set of keys.

At 6pm that day, she was also filmed leaving a ward at the East Surrey Hospital at Redhill, after the theft of a purse from a 98-year-old patient.

The woman is said to be 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in and of stocky build. She is believed to be in her late 30s to early 40s.

She spoke with a cockney accent, according to witnesses.

Some of them described her as mixed race although it could be that she has dark or tanned skin.

Detective Constable Paul Voigt, from West Sussex CID, said: 'This is a despicable series of thefts and burglaries, following a trail which has obviously been carefully planned.

'In the pictures we have from the East Surrey Hospital, she can clearly be seen counting the money in the purse.

'We need to identify and speak to her, before she strikes again.

'If you recognise her or have any information about the incidents, please call Sussex Police.'

The first pensioner's door key was stolen from St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London. Later that day, the same woman, in her 30s or 40s, was caught on CCTV at Crawley Hospital (centre), where another elderly patient's bag went missing. And that evening, she was filmed at East Surrey Hospital, where a 98-year-old's purse was stolen
