It is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes and is aptly known as the 'Volcano of Fire'.

But observers were still surprised this week when the Colima  peak erupted sending ash shooting 2.5 miles into the air.

An amazing timelapse shows the unexpected eruption, captured by a camera set up to observe the volcano.

The Colima volcano in western Mexico is one of the most active in the country

Located in the state of Colima, on Mexico's west coast, the volcano has long attracted geologists and scientists due to its constant rumblings.

Each day, mini eruptions take place, sending small plumes of ash into the sky.

However, this week's eruption is the largest in months.

Volcano Disvoer reported a 'strong vulcanian-type explosion' at 9.15am local time on Wednesday. 

In its biggest eruption since last year, the volcano spewed an ash column 2.5 miles into the air

Volcanic matter rose more than 29,000ft into the air after the eruption in western Mexico

The mountain belched an ash column more than 2.5 miles above the summit, with volcanic matter rising to 29,000ft.

The webcam focused on the active volcano captured the eruption perfectly as ash shot up into the blue skies above.

The Colima volcano is located in the western Mexican Volcanic Belt and has had more than 30 periods of eruptions since 1585.

The action was caught on camera by a webcam set up to monitor the volcano's activity

Ash fell on towns and villages as far as 15 miles away, but no properties were damaged

It had several significant eruptions in the late 1990s and continues to rumble on an almost daily basis.

Towns and villages are located near to the skirts of the volcano, but despite ash falling as far as 15 miles away, no homes or properties were damaged.

The footage was captured by a fixed camera set up by Webcams De Mexico after the last major eruptions in 2013 and 2014.
