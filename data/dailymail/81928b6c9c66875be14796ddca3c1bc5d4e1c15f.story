It measures just two by four metres, has a wardrobe space of 30 centimetres squared and costs a tiny $15,000, but Rebecca Benson can't wait to move into her new home.

The 22-year-old, along with her best friend Reece Brenan, hope to become the first Australians to complete construction of a moveable tiny house.

The trend, which has kicked off across the United States, has more and more people choosing to dump their mortgages and cluttered lifestyle for simple living conditions.

The best friends, from south Sydney in New South Wales, began construction on the miniature house for Rebecca one year ago, and plan to finish their Tiny Abode project by September.

With a height of almost four metres, the house has all the basic features of a typical home, including a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom - all in miniature proportions.

The duo from south Sydney in New South Wales, have a 'three use' principle when designing and furnishing  - each object must have at least three uses to be accepted

The home has one and a half stories, measuring two metres wide, 3.6 metres long and 3.8 metres tall. It was built onto a custom made trailer making it completely mobile

It's all about smart design and functionality according to Reece, 23, who said every single object brought into the house was specifically chosen and thoroughly scrutinised.

'The key thing to have in mind is making sure that each and every way you utilise the space is as effective as possible and everything that you bring in - every piece of furniture and every object - has a very practical function. It's not just there for desirability but for necessity,' he said.

'If you think of functionality – a lounge can be folded up and have storage underneath. In a conventional home you wouldn't be utilising that space – it would be completely wasted and just be sitting there collecting dust.'

Rebecca revealed the simple decision process behind all of their choices.

'We're using the three uses principle – if it doesn't have three uses then it shouldn't be in the house,' she said.

'So for example, a television – were not having one in the tiny abode.'

'A lot of houses in Australia, in fact the world - all the furniture is fixed towards a television. So it's been interesting designing a house without that being a centre point – it's complicated, but now everyone can just face each other.'

The house has all the basic features of a typical home, including a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom - all designed in miniature proportions in a functional and smart way

The rule means there is automatically no television in the house, according to Rebbeca, who said 'it's been interesting designing a house without that being a centre point'

The duo are yet to release the exact cost price for their project, deciding to keep it a surprise for the finale. However Mr Brenan claims that a tiny home could be constructed for as little as $15,000.

However, he admitted that this project will cost more due to it including 'features that are not entirely necessary' such as extra lights and hot water.

'But it would cost less than a deposit for a conventional one bedroom home', Reece said.

One of the main reasons they are starting the project, is the duo's interest in exploring how they can reduce their footprint on the environment.

'Were both quite switched on to the idea that homes in Australia are way bigger than they need to be,' Reece said.

'We all love having this expansive space because we live in a country that does have so much space.'

But according to Rebecca, the project is also about completing a good old-fashioned self-set challenge.

'I like the idea of designing my own home,' she said.

'I like being constrained and challenged and being able to live with less stuff. And I also like the idea of being able to move it!'

The master bedroom in the smart home, sits in an open loft above the rest of the house, accessible by a ladder and big enough for a large mattress

The dining table easily folds away, while a couch will be able to open up to double as storage space. Rebecca admitted that her wardrobe space will be 30cm by 30cm

As the first attempt of a moveable miniature house in Australia, the duo  found themselves faced with an enormous dilemma when it came to research, forced to discern the legal requirements that vary across the states as well as from council to council.

'A lot of the American designs where wider than what you can have in Australia. They don't necessarily have strict road width rules because they have huge cars so some of the tiny homes were four metres wide in the US – that's not tiny at all,' Rebecca said.

'In Australia you can't make anything more than 2.5 metres or it's classified as a wide load. So we had to change our design to fit that.

'The law changes between states about width and height and then there's the double complexity of councils because some councils won't let you live in demountable buildings in their area.

'Our home is two metres wide by 3.6 metres long and 3.8 metres tall – the loft inside it makes is one and a half stories. So we have built it to Australian standards.'

Reece revealed that Rebecca's home will cost over $15,000 due to including unnecessary features like extra lights, 'but it would cost less than a deposit for a conventional one bedroom home'

The key to the design is to utilise each space as effectively as possible, according to Reece who said every object will only be included for  necessity, not desirability

Due to being the first moveable home, the duo were forced to trawl through legal requirements that differ between states and even councils, before construction

Other problems arose for Rebecca and Reece in trying to design the house to be an environmentally sustainable, off-grid home.

'The technology is just not available to Australia,' Rebecca said, describing how she was turned away time and time again by solar panel providers.

'It was like: "I'm trying to give you lots of money to sell a product to me that I really want!" but they just kept putting up road blocks.

'Hopefully in the future we'll try again, because [the house] is totally customisable and handmade.'

Until then, the psychology student said she plans to freely travel around in her new home, which is attached to a customised trailer.

'I'm most looking forward to sharing it with others – I know it's a small place but we've had 10 people in it already,' she said.

'People are picturing this tiny box, but we have 11 windows – so it feels like a bigger space than it is –that was intentional in the design.'
