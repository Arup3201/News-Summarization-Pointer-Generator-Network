The onesie may have proved a fashion phenomenon, with celebrity fans including everyone from TV presenter Amanda Holden to boy band One Direction.

And the latest evolution of the all-in-one garment is promising to revolutionise business travel for millions of men around the world.

US-based property developer Jesse Herzog has created a one-piece suit – a radical design he calls a ‘Suitsy’ - and which he says is perfect for stepping off the plane and straight into the business meeting.

US-based property developer Jesse Herzog has created a one-piece suit – a radical design he calls a ‘Suitsy’

Mr Herzog, a property developer from San Francisco, invented the item which features a jacket, shirt and trousers all in one piece.

He says he came up with the design after feeling that traditional suits weren’t able to offer a suitable amount of comfort, particularly during long business flights.

Describing the garment as ‘the lovechild of a business suit and a onesie’, Mr Herzog says the design is a ‘revolution in apparel for the modern gentleman’ adding: ‘Imagine looking professional but feeling like you're in pyjamas.’

It features fake shirt cuffs which are attached to the ends of the jacket sleeves to give the impression of a complete dress shirt worn underneath.

‘The idea came from sitting at my desk at work and just thinking “Wouldn’t it be nice to look professional but feel as comfortable as I am on my couch at home?"’ Herzog told Yahoo Travel.

The item is not yet on sale, but Mr Herzog is appealing for donations on crowd-funding website Betabrand in order to begin production.

‘We hit our initial target: 2,400 people voted for it,’ Mr Herzog said.

If enough people order the suitsy online in the next 30 days, Betabrand will produce the garment.

The Suitsy is not yet on sale, but Mr Herzog is currently trying to raise money for production by offering prototypes for $283.50 (£176)

The cost of the item is currently $283.50 (£176).

Listing the reasons as to why he feels the garment will prove popular, Mr Herzog said it was comfy and easy to wash, noting that it doesn’t need to be pressed, and that it’s made of wrinkle-resistant fabric.

He also said that it was easy to pack into a suitcase and insists that the design is so good that ‘no one will guess you’re wearing what is essentially a fancy jumpsuit’.

Herzog says he considered, and rejected, adding a belt, a tie, and shoes to the Suitsy.

‘As we mature, we can’t wear sweats on planes,’ Herzog says. 

‘So it helps to look professional — especially if you’re traveling for work. And this suits that purpose very well, pun intended.’
