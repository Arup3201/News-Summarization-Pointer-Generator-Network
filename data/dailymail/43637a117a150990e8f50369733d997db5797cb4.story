Rev. Al Shaprton, the controversial civil rights leader-turned-broadcaster, was a confidential FBi informant for years and helped the feds put members of the Genovese and Gambino organized crime families behind bars, it was revealed Monday in a sensational exposé.

President Barack Obama will speak this
 week for the second time at the annual meeting of Sharpton's National 
Action Network.

New allegations published by The Smoking Gun allege that beginning in the 1980s, Sharpton worked as an informant for many years on mob groups for an organized crime task force made up of FBI agents and detectives with the New York Police Department.

In fact it was some of those investigators who gave Sharpton up, providing the documents to the website known for seeding the Internet with groundbreaking papers exposing details of court cases that embarass celebrities.

Sharpton has been part of President Obama's inner circle since his days as an Illinois state legislator -- long before the wayward reverend defended his friend nightly on MSNBC

Vincent 'Chin' Gigante (C) was a Genovese crime family boss who pretended to be mentally ill in order to escape responsibility for his crimes -- but Sharpton helped foil his plot when he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse

'[O]ne Gambino crime family figure became so comfortable with the protest leader that he spoke openly – during ten wired face-to-face meetings – about a wide range of mob business,' The Smoking Gun reported Monday.

That included everything 'from shylocking and extortions to death threats and the sanity of Vincent "Chin" Gigante, the Genovese boss who long feigned mental illness in a bid to deflect law enforcement scrutiny.

'As the mafioso expounded on these topics, Sharpton’s briefcase--a specially customized Hartman model – recorded his every word.'

Sharpton denied his law enforcement ties on Saturday when The Smoking Gun asked him point-blank about it.

He claimed his only link with the FBI was related to drug dealing cases in minority communities and recording industry efforts to cheat black artists in the recording industry.

But when asked whether he recorded his conversations with a Gambino mob family member, he would only say, 'I'm not saying yes, I’m not saying no.'

Veteran investigators who tracked Genovese crime family members for a living told The Smoking Gun that Sharpton, now 59, brought a specially-equipped Hartman briefcase to meetings with that mobster, recording the conversations and later handing the tapes over to the feds.

Sharpton's National Action Network, which will host Obama on Friday, has skirted responsibility for $1.9 million in 
back taxes and penalties it has owed the IRS since a 2006 investigation into improper tax reporting.

He
 also owes more than $888,000 in personal debts related to a failed 2004
 presidential campaign, and $100,000 more in related debts to 
the federal government.

There are strong personal ties between Sharpton and Barack Obama, including several Oval office visits on topics as diverse as jobs and education – mostly with other black community leaders.

Sharpton was also on hand for first lady Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party as a guest of hte Obamas. And he had a seat near the guest of honor at a State Dinner this year honoring French President Francois Hollande.

He brought his girlfriend, a woman barely half his age.

Vincent 'Chin' Gigante died in 2005 while serving a 12 year prison sentence after finally admitting he wasn't insane. This mug shot dates from 1960, when he was convicted at age 32 of helping mob boss Vito Genovese run a narcotics ring

Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, commands the attention of leaders like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (center R) and police commissioner William Bratton (C) , perhaps because he has helped the city make cases against mob bosses

But court affidavits and other papers The Smoking Gun published on Monday indicate that he also provided information to federal investigators that helped them persuade judges to authorize phone tapping and audio bugs at two Genovese family 'social clubs,' including Vincent Gigante’s headquarters in New York City's Greenwich Village.

They also put bugs in three cars and more than a dozen phone lines, largely because of information Sharpton provided, yielding information used in a major racketeering case against the Genoveses.

One such case targeted Federico 'Fritzy' Giovanelli, a Genovese soldier was drew a 20 years in prison sentence for racketeering; recordings made because of information Sharpton provided were played in open court.

Giovanelli later said he had no idea Sharpton was related to his case. 'Poor Sharpton,' he laughed: 'He cleaned up his life and you want to ruin him.'

The Smoking Gun claimed Monday that Sharpton became an FBI informant after he was 'flipped' – meaning that he was promised special legal treatment - perhaps immunity from prosecution - in exchange for his cooperation.

That case reportedly involved a 1983 sting operation aimed at boxing promoter Don King, who was convicted on second-degree murder in 1966, a host of elected officials, 'and 
several powerful New York hoodlums involved in concert promotion, record
 distribution, and talent management.'

President Barack Obama spoke at the 20th anniversary National Action Network Gala on April 6, 2011, and plans to return this week for a repeat performance

Golden boy: Sharpton has been untouchable despite his group's tax debts and his $888,000 in personal debts related to a failed 2004 presidential campaign

The White House did not respond to a question about whether the president will keep his speaking engagement at the National Action Network.

That group also did not respond to a request for comment.

Sharpton claimed in his 2013 book 'The Rejected Stone' that he never informed for the government, saying that any attempt to paint him as a snitch was a ploy to squelch his loud voice in the civil rights movement.

He was once 'set up by the government,' he said, when agents leaked 'false information' that 'could have gotten me killed.'
