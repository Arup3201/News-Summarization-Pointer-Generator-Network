Injuries: Lee Rose, 23, was left for dead by a hit and run driver in Leytonstone, east London

The parents of a man left for dead by a hit-and-run driver have pleaded for help in catching the person responsible.

Lee Rose, 23, was left in intensive care where his heart stopped three times during treatment following the crash in Leytonstone, east London, two weeks ago.

His family, who have staged a round-the-clock vigil by his hospital bedside, revealed his horrifying injuries in a bid to trace the driver who hit him.

His father Alex Dowie, 43, said the accident could easily have ended in tragedy. 'I just want them caught,' he said.

'Think if it was your own kid. How can you just drive away from something like that? It's just not right. The people responsible have got to be caught.'

A Met Police spokeswoman said an investigation has been launched and that officers were hunting the driver involved.

The crash happened after Mr Rose attended a party in Gants Hill with his friends on April 21.

The trainee railway worker had just got off a bus in Leytonstone High Road at about 12.30am when he was hit by the dark green people carrier. The force of the impact hurled him through the air - but the vehicle sped off.

A trainee nurse driving past immediately stopped to help him - giving him emergency treatment at the scene. Mr Rose suffered serious head injuries in the crash and was rushed to the Royal London Hospital.

Surgeons had to remove a quarter of his shattered skull and he was repeatedly brought back to life after his heart stopped. He underwent seven hours of brain surgery after developing a blood clot. He also sustained a fractured collarbone, broken ribs and a broken hand.

His mother Carol Rose, 43, who lives 
with him in Hainault, Essex, said: 'The hospital phoned and said there 
had been a serious accident and Lee had died at the scene and had just 
died again.

Trace: Mr Rose's family released pictures of his horrifying injuries in a bid to trace the driver responsible. The trainee railway worker is now out of intensive care

'I just remember running down the road to the cab station to go and see him. It was just terrible.'

Mrs Rose saluted the trainee nurse, called Laura, for stopping to help her son and said she would love to meet her to say a proper thank you.

'She brought him back to life. I would love to see this woman' she said, 'I would give her everything because if it was not for her Lee would not be here today - he would have gone.'

Mrs Rose said she thought her son was going to die. 'I've been in tears all the time and it's just been one huge nightmare,' she said. 'My heart goes out to the doctors - they have been absolutely amazing.'

Mr Rose's friend Matthew Daly, 23, of Hainault, was with him at the time of the crash. He said: 'There was a car driving erratically and it missed us by inches but hit Lee. We thought he was dead.

'Some of my friends tried to revive him and did mouth-to-mouth. He's only just got out of intensive care and is still in hospital.'
