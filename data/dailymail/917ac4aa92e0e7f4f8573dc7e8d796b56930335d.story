Accuser: Jeremy Paxman says TV bosses treat viewers like they are 'idiots'

University Challenge presenter Jeremy Paxman has defended today’s students saying it is ‘complete rubbish’ to suggest they are apathetic and ignorant.

He said questions on his long-running BBC2 quiz are tougher than ever, adding he was still shocked at how much current contestants knew.

Mr Paxman, 63, said that TV bosses should ‘stop insulting the public’s intelligence’ by ‘assuming we’re all idiots’ and said the reason why the  show has endured in popularity is down to the fact that it has refused to dumb down.

He said: ‘We haven’t compromised. It’s quite hard and it will stay quite hard. In an age when you can win shedloads of money or fleeting glory by knowing the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s first name (even though that one did seem to stump President Obama),’

Elaborating on his passion for University Challenge which he has presented for almost 20 years, he told the Radio Times: ‘The main reason I love University Challenge is that it gives the lie to the media stereotype about young people – that they all know nothing, and couldn’t care less.

‘It’s complete rubbish. Every year we see more and more teams of young people who know amazing things, and you’re just left wondering in pleasurable disbelief, “How on earth did they get that?”’

He added: ‘Television bosses should stop insulting the public’s intelligence by assuming we’re all idiots.’

Mr Paxman said his quiz had the ‘courtesy’ of treating the audience as though it were ‘clever enough to take part.’

Earlier this year on the show, Mr Paxman was branded ‘rude’ and ‘nasty’ by some viewers for the way he dealt with a nervous contestant. The corporation was hit with 44 complaints after the show was broadcast.

There has, in recent years, been a rivalry between University Challenge and Mastermind, presented by John Humphrys, about which programme asks the harder questions.

He said: ¿The main reason I love University Challenge is that it gives the lie to the media stereotype about young people ¿ that they all know nothing, and couldn¿t care less'

When Mr Humphrys interviewed Mr Paxman on the Today programme last year, to discuss the 50th anniversary of University Challenge, there was a discussion about whether students were getting ‘brighter’ or ‘dumber’ on the evidence of the show.

Paxman, famous for his own tough interviewing style, refused to divulge how he fared against the students on his BBC2 show, saying: 'That one I’m not going to answer.'

He added that his favourite round on the show was one in which students got every single question wrong - when they were asked to identify laundry instruction symbols on clothes labels.

He also claimed he had now asked 64,000 questions on the show, which airs on Monday nights on BBC 2.
