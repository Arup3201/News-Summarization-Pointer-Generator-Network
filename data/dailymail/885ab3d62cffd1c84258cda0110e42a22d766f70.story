Fulham are weighing up a £3million move for Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie.

The west London club are keen to add quality to their squad in a late push for the play-offs and could soon test the water by making an offer for the 25-year-old, who has scored six times this season. 

Eddie Howe would be highly resistant to letting one of his star players leave with promotion to the Premier League a realistic proposition but is aware Ritchie’s contract is up in 2016. 

Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie has emerged as a £3m target for Fulham

Ritchie is currently believed to be on a weekly wage of around £9,000 and Fulham would likely be willing to double that figure.

Howe, however, is looking to strengthen his Championship-topping side rather than let players go. Primarily, he wants to add a winger of genuine pace to play on the left.

Bournemouth have made two bids for Birmingham's Demarai Gray - but both have been rejected

Two bids for Birmingham's Demarai Gray, the latest reaching £2million, have been rejected as ‘derisory’ by Gary Rowett. Wigan’s Callum McManaman remains a more expensive option.
