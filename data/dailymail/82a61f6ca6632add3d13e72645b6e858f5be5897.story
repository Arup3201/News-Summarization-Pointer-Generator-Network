Booking a holiday when you cannot afford it and driving with a near-empty tank of petrol are the two best ways to live life on the edge, research has shown.

Driving through a red light, buying something frivalous which will take you into your overdraft and crossing the road when the red man is showing are also considered as some of the top 'edgy' things to do.

The study, which surveyed 2,000 people, also found that having an alcoholic drink at lunchtime, getting changed without closing the curtains and driving against the arrows in a car park were seen as daring.

Booking a holiday when you do not have the money to pay for it and driving a car on a near-empty tank of petrol are the top two examples of living 'life on the edge', according to a survey

The research, which was commissioned by Pizza Hut Restaurants, also found that 79 per cent of those who took part in the survey wished they had more excitement in their life.

More than three-quarters said their life lacked excitement, while 46 per cent admitted they would like to be more 'edgy'.

More than half of Britons also admitted they were not very daring, the research found.

Other signs of living life on the edge 
included driving through an amber light, sitting in a first class 
carriage on the train when you have a standard ticket and going out
 on a work night.

Being the last person 
to board a plan, eating cake for breakfast and consuming food past its 
sell-by date were also seen as daring.

Other top suggestions from those surveyed included ordering
 something other than 'your usual' in a restaurant, leaving your car 
unlocked or staying up past 11pm on a 
work night.

Jumping a red light is also seen as a way to be 'edgy', according to the survey of 2,000 Britons

Kathryn Austin, marketing director at Pizza Hut Restaurants, which commissioned the research to launch The Edge pizza, said: 'For some, living on the edge means being a daredevil or doing something risky like bungee jumping or sky-diving.

'But
 for everyone else, something as minor as making a change to their usual
 routine, or doing something they know they shouldn't be can be seen as 
'living on the edge.'

'Day-to-day,
 most people will live their life the same as any other day and can 
often feel like they are stuck in a rut, so even the smallest of risks 
can make that day more exciting.

'So
 while booking a holiday without actually having the means to pay for it
 may seem quite tame, for many Brits, the idea of putting a luxury like 
that on their credit card is as daring to them as a sky dive is to 
others.'
