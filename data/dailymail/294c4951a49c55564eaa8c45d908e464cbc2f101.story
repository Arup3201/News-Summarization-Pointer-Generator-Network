When Hurricane Sandy struck New York last October thousands of cars were either damaged or abandoned in the storm.

In the days that followed, more than 3,000 were towed from emergency routes for street cleaning.

City officials estimate more than 500 Cadillacs, Toyotas and BMW's remain unclaimed.

Now the city is auctioning these 'flood-damaged but may be salvageable' vehicles.

Submerged but salvageable: Cars that were abandoned or damaged by Hurricane Sandy are to be sold at auction next month.Their owners decided not to claim them after the destructive storm

The storm which swamped lower Manhattan and destroyed beachfront communities including the Rockaways in Queens.

The storm surge saw many cars drift down the street several blocks from where they were parked.

Some landed on front lawns, inside homes or under trees.

An estimated 230,000 vehicles in the region were damaged or destroyed by Sandy, according to insurance industry estimates.

Iconic: Images such as this one of a taxi garage in Queens, NY became symbolic of the destruction and disruptions to daily life that Sandy created

With so many unclaimed cars to deal with the city set up a telephone hotline for owners to pick up their posessions.

Technically, under state law, unclaimed cars can be sold after 10 days.

Owners, lien holders and insurance companies were notified. Records were also checked at the National Insurance Crime Bureau.

As of January, 696 vehicles were unclaimed but this weekend there are now 535 unclaimed vehicles that are set to be auctioned next month.

There are some potentially good deals to be had with prices as low as $300.

Pile of junk: Usually when cars become submerged under water as in this street in Hoboken, New Jersey their engines are ruined... but you never know!

Bargain hunting buyers would have to be prepared to take a gamble however because not only do the cars hot have keys, the vehicles can't be registered for road use without an inspection.

In some cases they may only be useful for spare parts.

The website of the auctioneer David R Maltz in Central Islip on Long Island states there are passenger cars luxury cars, classic cars, vans, SUVs, 4x4s, sport cars and pickup trucks available.

'We’ve sold one as low as $300 and we had one above $10,000,' said auctioneer Richard Maltz to the New York Post.' Just because a vehicle is titled as flood-damaged doesn’t mean it’s inoperable. To some degree, it’s a gamble,'

Not going anywhere: Parked cars are partially submerged in flood waters in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York October 30th 2012

There are some risks: usually when salt water gets into the engine the car is going nowhere but the scrap heap.

Saltwater can ruin computer-controlled fuel and braking systems, heating and air-conditioning.

Water didn't reach the engines in all cases which means there is a glimmer of hope for any buyer.

Buyers need to bring 25 per cent of the deposit in cash or a bank cheque.

The auctions will be held, on May 2 and 7 with the proceeds going into city funds and 10 per cent to the auctioneer.

City officials have said that they will work with owners if they suddenly realise their cars are at the auction house.
