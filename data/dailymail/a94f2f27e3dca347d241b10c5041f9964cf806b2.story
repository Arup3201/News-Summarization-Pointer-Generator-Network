Commons Speaker John Bercow has run up a staggering half a million pounds in office expenses in just five years, it has been revealed.

Mr Bercow has incurred £495,592 in taxpayer-funded events, travel, clothes and other supplies since taking up the prestigious role in June 2009.

This includes £100,000 on overseas jaunts and £26,000 in formal dresswear - with £3,700 spent on just two suits.

It also includes more than £170,000 on 'official entertainment', £40,283 on UK travel, and even £2,400 on curtain cleaning.

Details of the Speaker's office expenses were obtained by The Sun under Freedom of Information laws.

The figures reveal Mr Bercow has run up £3,442 on TV licences, £7,104 on telecoms, and £7,308 on newspapers.

But he has notched up a less pricey sum of £251 on late night transport - with just £9 spent on postage.

Last year's bill - totalling £59,709 - was two-thirds lower than in 2009/10, during which more than £180,000 was run up in expenses.

This appears to be due to the government's chauffeured car service - which cost taxpayers a whopping £36,254 in 2009/10, £11,362 in 2010/11, but nothing in the past three years.

A spokesman for the Speaker's office, which has six staff, told MailOnline: 'Every effort is taken to keep running costs down.

'Office costs have been cut by two thirds since Mr Speaker took office.'

Controversy: It comes just days after Mr Bercow - pictured with his wife Sally and a Metropolitan Police officer -  backed the 'sack[ing' of Scotland Yard and use of private security to take on a high-profile role at the Commons

It comes just days after Mr Bercow was accused of putting  MPs’ safety in jeopardy after backing the 'sack[ing]’ of Scotland Yard and use of private security to take on a high-profile role at the Commons.

Mr Bercow was told he was risking ‘disaster’ by agreeing to the privatisation of the airport-style searching and screening of visitors to the Palace of Westminster.

The move, agreed with the House of Lords, comes amid complaints that the cost of the Metropolitan Police’s contract for the security of the entire Palace – £31 million a year – is too high.
