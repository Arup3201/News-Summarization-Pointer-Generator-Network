In a repeat of the stunt when it launched the first Mustangs 50 years ago, Ford has parked an anniversary model of the car on top of the Empire State Building.

To mark the half-century, it seemed only natural to return to New York City, where the car was first revealed at the 1964 World's Fair.

Only 1,964 of the limited-edition cars will be released to honor the year when the iconic model was first shown to the public.

One of the limited edition Fords, with canary yellow paintwork, was shown off on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.

But is wasn't the first time Ford carried out the stunt. It first parked one of its convertibles there in 1965. 

Getting to the 86th floor was no easy feat, and the car had to be broken into six pieces and carried up the building's elevators in small sections.

It was put back together late at night, when the deck was closed to visitors, and it will remain on the viewing deck until Friday.

The team tasked with getting the car to the 86th floor faced many challenges, including getting a car that is wider than the original model to fit in the narrow elevators of the Empire State Building. 

â€˜The Mustang is wider than it was in 1965,â€™ program manager Prakash Pate said.

To make sure the car would fit, the team 
built a mock up of the building's elevators to check that each section 
would travel safely to the top.

Limited edition versions of the car currently on the observation deck will be among the first built when 2015 Mustang production begins later this year.

'It is an extremely limited edition, 
for our most diehard enthusiasts,' the motor company's executive 
chairman Bill Ford, whose first car was a green 1975 Mustang, said.

'This
 car is important to me, to my family and to everyone at Ford. The 
Mustang is a symbol of where Ford has been, and itâ€™s a vision of where 
we are going,' he told the Detroit Free Press.

Those wanting to own one of the limited editions will be able to chose between one of the two colors of Ford's logo: white or blue. Buyers will also be able to choose a manual or automatic transmission.

There are special chrome highlights 
around the sports car's grille, windows and tail lights. The Limited 
Edition will also be the only 2015 Mustang with a faux gas cap badge on 
the rear, where the original cap sat.

Ford
 is showing the Limited Edition at the New York auto show. Pricing 
wasn't announced but when the Mustang first rolled out of show rooms in 
1964, its starting price was $2,300.
