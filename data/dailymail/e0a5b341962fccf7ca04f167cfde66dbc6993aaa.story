GPs have been told to ask teenagers if they have been victims of revenge porn.

New guidelines have been drawn up to spot youngsters being made ill as a result of anxiety caused by sexting, cyber-bullying and radicalisation online.

The pressures of young people's lives played out online means they could be the trigger for headaches and stomach pains, or the reason while children start to play truant, the Royal College of GPs warns.

Family doctors should look for signs of modern social problems such as sexting and cyber-bullying, the Royal College of GPs has warned

A shocking study earlier this year found children now see 'sexting' as part of normal life.

The anti-bulling charity Ditch the Label found that 62 per cent of young people had been abused through a smartphone app, while 37 per cent had sent a naked photo of themselves, and 24 per cent had seen that image shared without their consent.

Girls were twice as likely to send a naked photo to someone than boys, the report said.

Now family doctors have been asked to look for signs of fears about internet pressures causing health problems.

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Children and young people today are facing unprecedented pressures from all angles at a younger and younger age.

'The arrival of the internet and social media has opened up so many opportunities but has also brought many threats, including cyberbullying, sexting and revenge porn.

'The unique relationship that GPs have with our patients means that we build up their trust and confidence over time and this places us in an ideal position to identify potential risks to the physical and mental health of our young people.'

The RCGP and children's charity the NSPCC have launched a 'toolkit' of advice today for doctors to help them identify issues, which also include female genital mutilation and forced marriage.

With doctors said to be on the 'front line', the RCGP said it was issuing the guidance, taking in advice from police, social workers, schools and government agencies, so they were better informed about what to do if they had concerns for a child.

Dr Baker added: 'As GPs we are trained to treat the 'whole person' and that means now taking into account a number of societal, as well as health, factors,' she said.

'A consultation with a GP may be the only time that young people can be alone with a trusted adult and we have a number of roles to play in providing understanding, compassion and support.'

Worries about online bullying can lead to health problems including anxiety, headaches and stomach pains

According to latest figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), 43,140 children were subject to a child protection plan and 68,110 children were 'looked after' in England in 2013.

Dawn Hodson, the NSPCC's neglect development manager said: 'GPs play a very significant role in keeping children safe, previous NSPCC research found that for every child subject to a child protection plan or on a child protection register, we estimate that another eight have suffered maltreatment.'

Doctors say sexting cases have become a major problem among two age groups. Children aged between six and eight swap intimate pictures of themselves out of curiosity about the differences between the sexes.

But young teenagers know the images are sexual and share them with a boyfriend or girlfriend, but face devastating consequences if the pictures are later shared without their consent.
