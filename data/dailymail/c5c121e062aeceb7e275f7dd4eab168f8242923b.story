Beach huts are proving more popular than ever as holidaymakers across Britain desperately snap up their own little piece of home beside the sea.

While many luxury beach huts on the market cost more than a brand new, fully-functioning home, not all seaside investments need to break the bank.

From a £245,000 plush beach hut in Shaldon, Devon, to a £14,000 seafront property in Hove, East Sussex, there’s a beach hut on the market to suit every budget.

Beach huts are now a sought-after property for holidaymakers who are willing to pay above and beyond for their slice of the seaside. But not all need to break the bank, some in Hove, East Sussex, cost from £14,000

Despite being fairly small and basic, this colourful beach hut in Hove, East Sussex, is on the market for £14,000

In recent weeks, beach huts across Britain have sold for more than £115,000, while others have been marketed for in excess of £300,000. This beach hut in Felixstowe, Suffolk, is on the market for £19,995

Despite appearing to be very basic inside, this beach hut in Felixstowe, Suffolk, is on sale for just under £20,000 - despite nearby flats costing only £25,000. It does, however, open up onto the picturesque sandy beach

In recent weeks, some beach huts across Britain have sold for more than £115,000, while others have been marketed for in excess of a staggering £300,000.

It is an indication of how the housing market has changed over the years, with beach huts now the sought-after property for wealthy holidaymakers who are willing to pay above and beyond for their slice of the seaside.

However, it’s not just wealthy holidaymakers with cash to spare who are splashing out on seaside huts.

While the price of beach huts might be high in some parts of the country, there are also decent investments to be had in other areas.

In Felixstowe, Suffolk, some of the cheapest beach huts are on the market for £7,000  and many are situated right on the beach, with a ladder from the front door down to the sand.

In Hove, Brighton, one hut is currently on the market for £14,000 - which could prove a good investment if used well over the years.

The average price for a seafront beach hut in Whitstable, Kent (pictured), is £25,000 while huts are being offered for up to £70,000 in Wells-next-the-Sea, on the North Norfolk coast

Rising beach hut prices mean wealthy holidaymakers are regularly paying more than the cost of a house for their seafront property

Another, in a prime position on the 
seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, is on the market for £18,000 and 
comes newly decorated in pastel colours with 1950s floral interior.

Elsewhere,
 the average price for a modern, well-decorated seafront beach hut in 
Whitstable, Kent, is £25,000 while huts are being offered for up to 
£70,000 in Wells-next-the-Sea, on the north Norfolk coast.

For
 those with a bit more cash to splash, one of the most expensive beach 
huts - measuring just 19ft by 16ft - was put up for sale in Shaldon, 
Devon in April for £200,000 – costing five times more than a 
three-bedroom house currently on the market in Hartlepool.

Despite
 coming with a kitchenette area, bed, heating, television and skylights 
which automatically close when it rains, the property is no bigger than a
 room in a fully-functioning family home.

Other
 'one-bedroom' beach huts in the area also go for exceptional amounts of
 money - with another on the same stretch of seafront currently up for 
sale for £245,000.

Beach huts in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, vary in price but this pale blue property is on the market for £18,000

This beach hut is in a prime position on the seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, and is on the market for £18,000. It is full of 1950s charm with pastel colours, polkadots and floral interior

Despite many of the beach huts featuring a bed, kitchenette and storage space, they are no bigger than a single room in a fully-functioning family home

Marketed as a 'one-bed bungalow', it comes with a modern kitchen, a new bathroom with an electric shower, and sleeps two in the upstairs ‘maisonette’ bedroom - but it is smaller than most 'basic' studio flats in London.

In Christchurch, Dorset, there are beach huts up for sale for £225,000, with some estate agents marketing them as one-bedroom terraced properties. One situated on nearby Chesil beach, in Mudeford, was recently on the market for £300,000.

And in Southwold, Suffolk, one hut - called The Happy Days - was put on the market last month for £100,000. Due to it being located in one of the most sought-after stretches in the area, estate agents believe it will fetch more than its already steep asking price.

That’s despite the fact it has no water supply, no electricity, no heating and comes with limited furniture.

Beach huts are popular in sought-after Whitstable, Kent, where many cost from around £25,000

The Whitstable beach hut comes with a modern interior, single bed and plenty of storage space - but its seafront location means it comes at a price of £25,000

Popular: Beach huts are pricey at Mudeford Sandbank, near Christchurch Harbour in Dorset

Beach huts at Mudeford Spit, near Christchurch, Dorset, are among the most expensive in the country.

They sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent.

One of Mudeford Spit's huts was put on the market for £180,000 last summer and sold within days.

Meanwhile, Chalet number 4, on Beach Road, in West Bexington, Dorset, became one of the world's most expensive beach huts when it sold for £235,000 in 2006.

The felt-roof hut had a sitting room measuring 2.85m by 2.59m, a kitchen which was 1.3m by 4.11m, a toilet and one bedroom measuring 2.87m x 2.62m.

It had running water, drainage and mains electricity, a garden, the potential for off-site parking and can be lived in all year round.

The new owner won a heated five-way auction held in Sherborne, Dorset, to snap up the hut.
