Authorities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are still looking for a 21-year-old college student who disappeared from a bar early Thursday morning, after getting separated from his friends.

West Chester University senior Shane Montgomery was last seen getting kicked out of Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood around 2am Thursday and hasn't been seen since. 

Volunteers have been aiding local authorities in the search, but on Sunday family members issued a statement saying they would not be gathering. 

'I just wanted to reach out and remind everyone we are NOT meeting today until we are given the okay from the Marine Unit and Search and Rescue. We would like the authorities to be able to do their search throughly and without any unintentional interferences from the volunteers,' according to a statement issued on Montgomery's missing person's Facebook page.

'Thank you for the continued prayers, positive thoughts, donations, and shares, as well as a big thank you all the people who have come out in the cold to help us look for Shane.'
