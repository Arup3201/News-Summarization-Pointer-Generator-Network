England striker Wayne Rooney has shown more promising signs in his bid to be in peak condition for this summer's World Cup.

The 28-year-old released another video on his official Facebook page on Friday of his training session with two fitness coaches during his holiday to the Algarve.

Rooney took part in sprints and some ball work as he was watched by son Kai, wearing a red England top with number 10 on the back.

Rooney wrote: 'Another good training session.....picking up the pace. Always good to have Kai on the sidelines cheering me on!'

Rooney has yet to score a goal at a World Cup and his two previous campaigns have been blighted by injury.

He was rushed back from a metatarsal injury for the 2006 World Cup and carried an ankle knock into the 2010 tournament in South Africa.

Despite missing the last three matches of a disappointing Manchester United season with a groin strain, Rooney is confident he will be fully fit for England's opener against Italy on June 14.

Rooney, meanwhile, could be part of a contingent of 14 England players who will be attending an unique Nike promotion event in London, exclusively for supporters on May 26.

The Three Lions' sponsors are hosting a week-long celebration at the 'Nike Phenomenal House', where they will transform the Sorting Office in Oxford Street for the players to go head-to-head in a series of interactions, fusing the worlds of music, style, innovation and football.

The likes of Jack Wilshere, Daniel Sturridge and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will also be involved potentially with Rooney, along with a visit from cycling hero Mark Cavendish, double Olympic champion Mo Farah and a host of other sporting icons.
