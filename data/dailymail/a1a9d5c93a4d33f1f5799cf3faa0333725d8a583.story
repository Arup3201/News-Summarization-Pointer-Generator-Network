A very excited game show contestant took a trip this week - but not of the tropical island variety.

When Kalyn Allen from Arvin, California, correctly guessed the price of a paddle board winning the Most Expensive Game, she enthusiastically ran towards announcer George Gray, arms outstretched.

But the planned hug did not go smoothly when Allen tripped on a rug and was launched headlong into Gray's crotch.

Moment of truth: Kalyn Allen awaits her fate, before she finds out she has won the Most Expensive Game

Winner: Kalyn Allen heads towards announcer George Gray for a celebratory hug

The edge of the rug is lifted where Allen's foot caught underneath - setting in motion a series of hilarious events

On a trip: George Gray looks as though he believes he can still rescue the situation

Unfortunate: But things go from bad to worse when Allen lands on her knees in front of Gray's crotch

It looks for a moment as if Gray will prevent the embarrassing tumble but Allen's forward momentum proves too much.

Celebrity guest Chrissy Teigen watches in horror and then runs to the aid of Allen and Gray, who by this point have fallen backwards into a television, and ends up awkwardly hugging Allen's rear end.

Host Drew Carey makes no attempt to disguise his mirth as he and the audience exploded in laughter at the humorous spectacle.Â 

Gray, red in the face but also laughing, is helped up by Tiegan who lays him down on the offending mat and pretends to do CPR.

By this point, the script has 
entirely been thrown out the window and Carey can barely get the words 
out to tell the at-home viewers to stick around after the commercial 
break.

For her part, Allen looks equally amused - as she would.

She
 may have just tripped over in a truly slapstick fashion on national 
television, but she also won cameras, paddle boards, designer shoes, and
 two televisions.

Not over yet: Chrissy Teigan runs to help as Allen and Gray fall backwards into the televisions

The model succeeds only in hugging Allen's backside awkwardly as Allen tries to help Gray up

Added bonus: Teigan adds to the mood of frivolity by pretending to administer CPR on Gray

Host with the giggles: Drew Carey is unable to contain himself and laughs all the way to the commercial break

The good-humored barista posted the clip on her Facebook today, with the caption, 'I'm famous!!! LOL!!!!'

She said she had watched the clip six times and laughed each time.

'Everyone was more concerned about me than him. I felt so bad, I must've apologized at least 10 times! I got a nice rug burn on my knee so after I spun the wheel, they took me backstage, patched me up and had me sign a waiver,' she wrote.

'I'd do it again in a heartbeat, tumble and all!'
