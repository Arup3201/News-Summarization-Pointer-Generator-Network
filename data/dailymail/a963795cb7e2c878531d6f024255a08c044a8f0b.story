Patsy Coleman, 48, found out she had tumours in both of her breasts after being randomly called up to attend a breast cancer screening early

A mother-of-two was shocked to discover she had cancer in both of her breasts, after being randomly selected for a cancer screening programme.

Patsy Coleman, 48, wasn't due for a breast screening until her 50th birthday under national guidelines, but was called up early as part of a pilot scheme into early screening.

A mammogram revealed that Mrs Coleman, from Stoke Gifford in Brisol, had a cancerous tumour in her right breast.

After undergoing a double mastectomy operation to remove both her breasts, surgeons discovered she had a second tumour in her left breast.

Mrs Coleman, who works as a cashier and receptionist, has now recovered and is urging the government to lower the screening age for all women.

She said: 'The shock of being told I had breast cancer was one thing - but that it was likely I had developed a bi-lateral cancer that can affect both breasts was devastating.

'I went through a whole journey of emotions, from anger to panic.

'I couldn't think straight and thankfully my sister Julie was with me through all these stages, helping me to come to terms with it all and giving me support and guidance through hospital and at home.

'My consultant could see I was upset and he turned to Julie and said: "It's OK, I can fix her".

'I tried to remain upbeat through it all and now I'm back to full health more or less.

'I think they should reduce the screening age - it made a huge difference to me. It wasn't my time to go.

'It is difficult to say what would have happened if I had waited to 50 and it makes me feel sad when I think that I was saved, but another woman elsewhere might not get the same chance.'

Six breast screening units in England took part in the early testing pilot scheme, which invited a selection of women aged 47 to 49 to have early testing.

Mrs Coleman, who is now divorced, was one of the women in her area to be randomly selected and sent an invite to a mammogram in July last year.

During a follow-up appointment she was diagnosed with a tumour in her right breast and opted for a double mastectomy last September.

It was only two weeks after the major operation that medics discovered a second completely separate cancer in her left breast.

The NHS Breast Screening Programme screens around 1.6 million women a year.

Women aged 50 to 70, who are registered with a GP, are automatically invited for screening every three years. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthdays.

Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit. 

The NHS has extended the breast screening age range in England so that all women aged 47 to 73 will be invited.

Screening takes place at a special clinic or mobile breast screening unit. A mammogram (X-ray of the breast) is taken by a female health professional. 

The mammogram is then studied to look for any abnormalities. 

The aim is to detect breast cancer at an early stage, when any changes in the breast would be too small to feel and when there is a good chance of successful treatment and full recovery.

Not all cancers are found during breast screening. Breast cancer can develop between screening appointments. 

Even if you go to breast screening, it is important to get to know your breasts so you can spot any unusual changes early on and report them to your GP.

She had 12 weeks of gruelling chemotherapy to catch any rogue cancer cells and  this month had a final reconstructive procedure.

She said she has tried to stay upbeat despite suffering breast cancer.

She said: 'I didn't let it get me down and now I feel healthier than before.

'Without knowing it, before the cancer I was quite ill - I didn't have much energy and I was feeling pretty lousy.

'Now I want something good to come out of it all - if other people my age and younger can be helped, that would be great.'

Currently all women aged over 50 are offered a breast screening every three years.

In December 2007, the Department of Health's Cancer Reform Strategy proposed extending the screenings to cover women between the ages of 47 and 73.

An initial pilot scheme was carried out and now Public Health England is extending the trial to more than 70 units throughout the country.

Mrs Coleman's lead clinician Mike Shere said her case proves early screening is the way forward.

He said: 'When we look for benefits it is calculated quite crudely in terms of does it save peoples' lives?

'This means not just identifying the cancer earlier than we would have, but also does it make a difference, do we save their life?'

Professor Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, managed by Public Health England, said: 'This trial has full ethics approval and will prove internationally important to show whether screening in the extended age ranges saves lives.

'It's being run as it is because a randomised control trial was considered the best way to gather the most robust evidence.

'Led by researchers at the University of Oxford's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, the trial extends the screening age to women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73.

'Women who are invited as part of the trial receive an ethics approved information leaflet in addition to the more general informed choice breast screening leaflet.

'Any woman in a trial area in the age extension age group who doesn't get an invitation, but hears about the trial, can be screened on request.

'There is no upper limit on breast screening so any woman can ask to be screened once she comes out of the routine invitation age group at 70.'

Mrs Coleman is also walking in the first ever March On Cancer - one of 15 simultaneous events around the UK on October 11 to raise money for Cancer Research UK.

She said: 'Having gone through a double mastectomy, coping with hair loss and chemotherapy, I wanted to do something to mark the occasion.

'I've come through the treatment now and I'm determined to recruit others to fight against this devastating disease.'
