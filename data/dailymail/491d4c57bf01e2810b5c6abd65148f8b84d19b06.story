Arsene Wenger is facing another midfield injury headache after Francis Coquelin suffered a broken nose on Sunday.

The Frenchman will discover today whether he needs surgery after he was injured in a nasty collision with team-mate Olivier Giroud before taking another blow in the closing stages.

Should he need an operation, Coquelin could expect a prolonged period on the sidelines, but even if a procedure isn't required the midfielder is a doubt for Wednesday's trip to Queens Park Rangers.

Arsenal are already without key central midfielders Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere, while Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini, who didn't feature on the bench yesterday, only returned to training at the end of last week.

'Yes, Coquelin has broken his nose. If he needs surgery or not I don't know,' said Wenger.

Coquelin needed lengthy treatment following the clash of heads in the 67th minute but played on until the 89th when he was hauled off after taking a second blow as he went up for a header with Steven Naismith.

And Wenger revealed it was the 23-year-old's decision to continue playing.

'After he took a hit on it again I had to take him off,' Wenger added.

'I had been told by medical people he could stay on and he wanted to stay on.'

Arsenal keeper David Ospina made three excellent saves to shut out Everton and manager Roberto Martinez said: 'I felt we were the ones creating the chances and when you create them you need to take them.'
