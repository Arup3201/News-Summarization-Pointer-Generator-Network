An alleged 'maternity hotel' in Southern California where pregnant women from China stayed so they could give birth there and make their babies American citizens in the process has been closed.

Neighbors of the property in the quiet neighborhood of Chino Hills, set up a protest group and repeatedly complained that women - at one point up to 30 - were being put up in the home in a 'birth tourism' scheme, according to the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. 

Officials filed a restraining order on the grounds that the business was in violation of city building codes and it has since been vacated.

'Maternity hotel': This gated property in Chino Hills, California, was allegedly operating as a hotel where Chinese women could give birth and earn their babies American citizenship

'To the best of our knowledge, it is unoccupied right now,' Chino Hills city spokeswoman Denise Cattern told the newspaper.

'This is the first step in a legal process that we feel will permanently shut down the home as a hotel,' Chino Hills Mayor Peter Rogers said. 

'From the moment the city had confirmation this home was being occupied as a hotel, it was just a matter of following the code enforcement process to its ultimate conclusion. We are hopeful this matter will be legally concluding soon.'

So called 'maternity hotels' don't 
violate federal law - a woman is permitted to travel to the U.S. on a 
tourist visa and give birth. 

If a baby is born in the U.S it is 
automatically granted citizenship, they can then live in the country
as an adult and apply for a full green card.

Citizenship: Mothers from China who want to earn their children American citizenship are increasingly taking part in 'birth tourism' where they fly to the U.S. to have their babies on American soil

Maternity hotel packages are priced at up to $20,000. The mother usually stays in the U.S. for around a month after the baby is born.

City laws tend to be the way neighbors get such properties closed down.

In this case building work was allegedly
 carried out on the home without a permit and their was no license to 
operate it as a hotel.

Court documents listed the owner of the Chino Hills property as Los Angeles Hermas Inc under the names Hai Yong Wu and Yi Wang.

Protest: Residents in Chino Hills demonstrated against the alleged maternity hotel last month

Residents from surrounding properties took part in a 'Not in Chino Hills' protest against the business last month. Dozens of protesters held up placards saying 'No More Anchor Babies'. 

Wu and Wang are expected in court again on January 17.

It is alleged that the pair turned the six bedroom house into a 17-bedroom hotel with monogrammed towels and bathrobe, according to the report.

There have been several similar cases in the area in the past few years.

Local residents previously told the Press Enterprise why they were so opposed to the property.

Rossana Mitchell told the Press: 'Apparently this is an epidemic happening nationwide. We're outraged, we think it is unethical and un-american. We don't believe that's what America and the American dream is about'.
