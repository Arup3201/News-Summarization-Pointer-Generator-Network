A video has revealed the moment an eagle eyed bus driver spots a barefooted young child wandering in the road - before stopping the bus and taking him to safety.

Bill Clark was driving a TriMet bus in Gresham, Oregon at 8.15am last Friday when he spotted the boy, who was wearing nothing but a t-shirt and a diaper, walking in the road.

Cameras mounted on the bus capture the harrowing moment the little boy attempts to walk from a quieter side street on to Northeast Division Street just moments after the vehicle passed.

Spotted: A camera on a bus shows a small boy wandering into a road in Oregon during the morning commute

Caught on camera: The little boy was wearing only a diaper and a t-shirt when he was seen by the driver

Clark immediately stopped the bus and jumped down to help the boy, the videos shared by TriMet reveal.

The boy runs towards him and Clark can be seen bending down to talk to him, but the boy would barely speak - apart to say he did not know where he lived.

Video shows him taking the boy's hand and leading him to the
 bus.

Another camera inside captured Clark bringing him on board and trying to talk to him.

'I asked him if he wanted some hot chocolate, and when I said chocolate, he lit up and said, 'chocolate!'" Clark told KPTV.

Helped aboard: Clark can be seen leading the barefooted boy, named James, onto the bus

Clark grabbed the cup, checked the heat of his hot chocolate and then gave it to the boy to 
sip.

He also gave the boy part of an oatmeal raisin cookie until workers from the Department of Human Services arrived.

Clark called the TriMet's operation command center to tell them what had happened, and he was told to drive to the Gresham Central Transit Center nearby because he was blocking traffic.

The little boy, who is named James, was reunited with his father, who called police to report the boy missing.

He explained that he works night shifts and had fallen asleep when the boy let himself out of the apartment and wandered into the road. The boy's mother was already at work.

Lucky escape: He gives the little boy hot chocolate before driving to a nearby depot. James was later reunited with his father, who had fallen asleep after working the night shift

Happy to help: Clark dismissed claims that he was a hero, saying: 'I did what anybody should do'

DHS workers interviewed the parents, who were not charged with anything, and told them to install child locks to prevent a similar situation.

Transit police submitted a commendation for Clark - who has worked for the company for seven year - but he insisted that he is not a hero.

'I don't like that label,' he said. 'I just did what I think anybody should do or would have done under the same circumstances.'
