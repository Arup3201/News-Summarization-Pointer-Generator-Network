An abandoned dog in Massachusetts got VIP treatment as she boarded the private plane of Vice President Joe Biden last week.

Peggy, a nine-month-old Labrador mix, has been taken in by Biden's eldest son, Beau.

The 42-year-old and his wife, Hallie, decided to adopt the pooch from a shelter while spending Thanksgiving in Nantucket and airlifted it more than 390 miles back to their home in Delaware.

The couple have since renamed the dog, Indi.

The dog was originally found in Mississippi by Barb Mauller who runs a small animal shelter from her home.

She says she regularly drives dogs 1,500 miles to Nantucket Safe Harbor for Animals because they're easier to place than in Mississippi.

The Biden family traditionally spends Thanksgivings in the resort town of Nantucket.

Beau, who serves as Delaware attorney general, and his wife spotted Indi while they were out walking with their two children, Natalie and Hunter. 

The family apparently fell in love with the animal, who was wearing an 'adopt me' scarf at the time. 

Nantucket shelter president Pamela Murphy said she only learned who the family was when they went to fill out adoption forms on Saturday.

Shelter workers were even more surprised when Beau's father showed up to wave Indi off.

The pup flew on  Air Force Two, an aircraft used by the 72-year-old Vice President, with her adoptive family.

She  joins one-year-old yellow Labrador named Liberty at her new home.

Barb Mauller, who originally found Indi, told The Clarion-Ledger that she thought it was 'pretty cool' that the Bidens were the ones who took her in.

'I think it’s just wonderful that people open their hearts and homes to these dogs,' she added.
