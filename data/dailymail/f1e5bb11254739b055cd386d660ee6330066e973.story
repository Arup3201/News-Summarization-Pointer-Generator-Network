A basset hound was doused with petrol and burned alive before being left to die from the gruesome injuries in a ravine near his home.

A neighbour spotted a small fire in a ravine in Camarillo, California on Sunday morning and alerted firefighters, who were horrified to discover the severely burned three-year-old hound, Buddy.

The dog died from his injuries hours later.

Reward: Local police are offering $1,000 to those who help bring those responsible for Buddy's (not pictured) grisly death to justice. The dog was doused with lighter fluid and set alight near his California home

Police have interviewed the dog’s owner, James Delgado, who also owns two other basset hounds, , according to the Los Angeles Times.. 

Mr Delgado said the family was upset, and were trying to move on from the incident which occurred on Saturday.

‘We are sad it occurred, and we are trying to get past it right now,’ Mr Delgado told the Ventura County Star.

The incident occurred in the early 
hours of Saturday morning behind the Delgado family’s home, according to
local sheriff Sgt Eric Buschow.

Buschow noted that there was evidence
the dog had been doused with lighter fluid and set on fire, but it 
remains unclear how the dog got out of the home and into the ravine.

‘There was evidence at the scene that 
made it apparent that someone had poured lighter fluid on this dog and 
set the dog on fire,’ Buschow said.

‘There have been cases of animal 
cruelty, but I've never heard of someone pouring fluid on an animal and 
lighting it on fire,’ Buschow told the Ventura County Star. ‘It's a horrible, 
horrible crime.’

Arson investigators and the Ventura County Sheriff's bomb squad have been called in to assist in solving the crime.

A reward of $1,000 has been offered for information leading to an arrest but no suspects have yet been named.

Jolene Hoffman, shelter director of 
the Ventura County Human Society, told the Ventura County Star: ‘The 
torture that poor animal suffered — it makes you sick.

‘The cruelty that goes on — it still completely blows you away no matter how much you see or how much you witness.’
