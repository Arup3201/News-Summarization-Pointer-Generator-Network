A passenger train has hit two pedestrians in separated incidents on a single journey within the space of just 48 miles.

A man was killed by the Amtrak service between Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina, at about 12.30pm on Sunday.

The service, carrying 80 passengers, was held for three hours while police investigated the fatal incident on the outskirts of Durham, just 30 miles into the journey.

But not long after the Amtrak Piedmont 75 train resumed its trip, it collided with a second body on the tracks near Greensboro, just 48 miles after the first tragic collision.

No injuries were reported among the crew or 80 passengers.

Investigators had not released the identity of the man who was killed during the first incident.

It is not yet clear why he was on the train tracks and is subject to an ongoing investigation.

Passengers took to Twitter to express their shock at the two tragic incidents.

One wrote: 'My train is now delayed for 3 hours because it hit two people in Durham and Greensboro. What the heck?'

The accident is the second in the Triangle this month involving an Amtrak train, according to WRAL.com.

Lauren Webb, 21, of Laurinburg, was killed January 2 when the car she was in was hit by a northbound Amtrak Silver Star train in Cary.

In February, last year, 26-year-old Kwado Gyamfi was struck and killed by a freight train in Greensboro.

Authorities said the vehicle drove around a lowered crossing arm. The driver, Benny Derrick Dimery, 24, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.

The tragic incidents came just a few days after a woman was killed when her vehicle collided with an Amtrak train in Cary, North Carolina on Thursday 2 January.

Town of Cary spokesman Susan Moran says the accident occurred at a rail crossing on Southwest Maynard Road.

The woman was declared dead at the scene. A man pulled from the wreckage was transported to WakeMed in Raleigh.
