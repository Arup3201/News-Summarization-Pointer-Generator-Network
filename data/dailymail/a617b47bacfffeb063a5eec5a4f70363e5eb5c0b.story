An artist who had her identity stolen by a woman in 2011 has found a unique and interesting way to deal with the horrific experience.

Jessamyn Lovell, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had her wallet stolen from the gallery SF Camerawork in San Francisco by a woman named Erin Hart, leading to months of mysterious bills, parking tickets, and even a summons to appear in court on theft charges.

Angry and frustrated, she channeled her rage into a new art project, Dear Erin Hart.

Getting her back: Angry and frustrated, Jessamyn Lovell began to photograph Erin Hart (pictured) after she was released from prison on identity theft charges, some of which were related to Lovell

Show: These photographs became the inspiration for her project Dear Erin Hart

After tracking down Hart through a private investigator, she was waiting for the woman as she was released from prison on identity theft charges, some of which were related to Lovell. 

Then, Lovell began following, and photographing, her wherever she went.

There are photos of her on the bus and at a gas station, walking around the city and even shopping for clothes.

All over: She would photograph Hart everywhere, from the gas station to the bus to clothes shopping

Not letting up: Now, Lovell wants to confront Hart with a letter she wrote

She held an exhibition of the photos last month at SF Camerawork, the same place she had her identity stolen, and now Lovell is trying to raise money through a crowdfunding campaign to travel to San Francisco and present Hart with a letter she wrote her.

Above all else, Lovell wants Hart to be forced to see the victim of her crime.

What does she know?: Hart has made no comment about this, though she appears to be aware of the camera in some shots

On her way: The photos from the project have now been put on display

Getting her due: Lovell hopes that Hart will accept her letter 

People can donate funds on etsy. 

Hart has yet to respond, though she does seem to be aware of the photographer in many of the shots.
