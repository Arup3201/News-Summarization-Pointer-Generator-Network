The Orlando Magic cheerleader who suffered a horrific fall during a recent game is now focused on her recovery - and she's looking to get back on the court to perform again.

Jamie Woode suffered three fractured vertebrae and a broken rib when she took a misstep and dropped to the floor during a performance by the Magic's Stunt Team in a November 13 game against the New York Knicks, as tens of thousands of fans watched in horror.

Despite the devastating fall, Ms Woode did not seem to have any trouble walking, and was in high spirits during public appearances since her release from the hospital.

High spirits: Ms Woode says that she will have to wear a brace for three months, and said she is looking forward to performing again

The 31-year-old appeared vibrant as she walked onstage to discuss the accident during a press conference on Friday.

Doctors have outfitted Ms Woode with a brace that she is required to wear every day for the next three months.

Woode, who said she has been cheerleading for 20 years - has fallen 'hundreds of times before,' but none were as severe as the accident on November 13.

In an interview with NBC's Today Show this morning, Ms Woode relived the moment when she crashed to the ground.

She said: 'I was conscious for the whole thing. Obviously as a cheerleader falling and accidents like this happen. It's happened thousands of times before. So to me it was just one of those moments.

'I knew how to react to the situation. I knew to stay calm. The gentleman who I fell off of was an EMT so it was good to have him there on site. He was keeping me calm.'

Video of her fall, which has hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, 'I used to cringe when I first saw it but with the overwhelming
amount of support and positive feedback I’ve gotten from it, it’s been easier
to watch. It’s actually uplifting me if anything.

She added that she would like to return to the Stunt Team when she completes her rehabilitation.

She said: '[Doctors] said the surgery went great. So all I can do is take those positive comments and that positive feedback and go forward from there.'

After she fell, paramedics were immediately on the court to treat Ms Woode, who remained on the there for about five minutes.

She was moved onto a stretcher and a neck brace was used to immobilize her neck.

As she was wheeled off court she waved to the fans to let them know she was okay.

She told the Today show: 'When I heard the applause from the crowd, The first thing I wanted to do was let them know and reassure them that yes, I can move my arms and legs. I’m gonna be OK.'

Players and coaches from both the Knicks and Magic cheered for Ms Woode as she motioned to the crowd.

Woode was formally lauded nearly a 
decade ago by then-U.S. Rep Tom Feeney, R-Orlando, for competing with 
the championship UCF team despite suffering from a broken fibula.
