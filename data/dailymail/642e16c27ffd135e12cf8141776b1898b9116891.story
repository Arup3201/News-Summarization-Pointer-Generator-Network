A woman who ‘rescued’ what she thought was a stray kitten ended up in court after selling the animal.

Mother-of-four Suzanne Gilmore, 30, found the £400 pedigree Siamese kitten under a bush and took it back to her Blackpool home. 

For a month she cared for the creature, but after deciding the expense was too much, advertised it on the internet and sold it for £80.

The new owner later visited a web site called Pre-Loved and saw a picture of the cat she had just bought, where it was being described as lost. 

The original owner, Pauline Courtney, was contacted and was reunited with her pet. The police then got involved, and Gilmore found herself before Blackpool magistrates. 

After pleading guilty to the theft of the animal by finding it, she was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £80 compensation to the buyer, Jennifer Tilsley.

Magistrate Barry Birch told Gilmore: ‘It is to your credit that you cared for the cat.’

Alan Godwin, defending, said ‘She took compassion on it. However, there were other steps she should have taken.’

'She could have taken the animal to the police, a vet or the RSPCA and see whether it was micro chipped.She did not do enough to find out if the cat had an owner.'
