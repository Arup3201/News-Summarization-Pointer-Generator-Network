A person's view on whether climate change is real or not can be swayed by something as simple as what date they are asked and if the weather is expected for that time of year, a scientist has claimed.

Professor Nick Chater, from Warwick Business School, claims that if someone is questioned about climate change on a day in June when it is colder than expected, or raining, they will be more sceptical.

Alternatively, if they are asked on a winter's day when the sun is shining they're more likely to believe the phenomenon exists.

Some people believe that climate change and global warming is causing the ice caps to melt, pictured, while others deny it exists. A professor from Warwick Business School has now claimed that a person's opinion about climate change can be swayed depending on when in the year the question is asked, the weather, and even what is immediately around them

Chater calls this behaviour 'attribute substitution' and says that it can be applied to other complex issues, too.

In the first episode from series two of BBC Radio 4’s The Human Zoo, Chater discusses how people look to find simple shortcuts in things they can see, and their surrounding environment, to solve complex issues, such as the debate around climate change.

Attribute substitution – where a person replaces a complicated question that needs a judgement with a more easily calculated attribute – underlies these shortcuts.

'When you look at the climate change argument you can see this at play,' said Professor Chater, of Warwick Business School.

'A recent large scale web survey on a single day across the world asked the question ‘just how much do you believe that climate change is real?’'

'It wanted to see how much that judgment was affected by whether the temperature of the particular location was hotter or colder than average for that time of the year.

Research from the Warwick Business School also found that people who are shown the same graph or climate change image, pictured, will interpret it differently, depending on their viewpoint. Believers will read into changes and lines, while sceptics will play them down - even if the line is based on factual data

The research found that if it is hotter than average on the day someone is asked, then the participant is more likely to believe there is such a thing as climate change. Whereas, if it is a colder than average day they tended to be more sceptical.

'It indicates we are being pushed around by very immediate things, like what we see when we look out the window,' added Chater.

A separate experiment on students at Warwick Business School showed how the same data could be interpreted differently by those who believe in climate change and those that don’t.

Professor Nick Chater claims that people use 'attribute substitution' as a way of using things around them to influence their decisions on complex debates - such as climate change endangering polar bears - so they don't have to think too hard

'We gave them a graph with a wiggly line on it and asked the students to continue it in the way that seemed most natural,' said Chater.

'We then gave them another wiggly line, but this time it was real data plotting the average global temperature from 1880 to 2010, and told them it was a climate change prediction task and to guess how that graph would continue.

'Then on a scale of one to seven we asked them how worried they were by climate change.'

'We found that if somebody thinks climate change is real, they tend to extrapolate upwards in temperature more than people who have the opposite view.

'That is true when they think the data is about climate change but not true when they see the wiggly pattern has no particular meaning.

'And when people are more sceptical they tend to keep the line flatter.'

'It shows it is very hard for us to look at data in a dispassionate way.

'When we consider how data is going to continue we think both about what it shows so far but also what our general knowledge or beliefs tell us.There is a danger it can mean the data can look different depending on your perspective.

'If I am a climate change sceptic I might look at the same data and think that doesn’t show much of a trend upwards, but somebody who strongly believes in climate change might look at the same data and see a much more alarming trend.'

When faced with complex issues, finding shortcuts like attribute substitutions is, Professor Chater adds, a perfectly rational thing to do.

'Attribute substitution is part of a more general tendency to find short-cuts to difficult problems and that gets you quite a long way,' said the Professor of Behavioural Science.

'If you are wondering how large a city is you might think it is famous, it has an enormous river flowing through it, a well-known football team and so think it is a large city.

'It is using available simple information to solve a difficult problem and on the whole that works pretty well.

'We live in an enormously complex world so theses simplifications and short-cuts are essential, even though they produce biases, they allow us to work and behave.'
