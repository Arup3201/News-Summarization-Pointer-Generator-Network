A grateful widow has revealed how a kindhearted stranger made her Valentine’s Day after paying her grocery bill when her credit card got refused at the local supermarket.

Tiffany Slawski of Thornton, Colorado, and her son -  David, 7, and Brandon, 3 - are still coming to terms with the death of Mark, 47, who passed away last July.

The grieving mom and her youngest son were shopping in their local supermarket on Friday when Brandon started to cry.

Tiffany Slawski of Thornton, Colorado, and her son David, 7, contacted their local TV news station to express their deep gratitude to a stranger who paid their grocery bill on Friday

Initially his mom thought his tears were because he was couldn’t have a soda.

‘I began to explain to him that you can't always have everything that you want,’ Tiffany told 9News.

‘He said, “I'm just sad my daddy died.” A woman next to us overheard, and she looked at me - and I, with a nod, confirmed yes. And she said, “I'm so sorry.'"

As fate would have it, the very same stranger was behind them as they got in line to pay for their groceries.

Tiffany had an unexpected issue with her credit card, and had to leave her cart to get another card.

When she returned, the kindhearted lady who had overheard her previous conversation with her young son had paid her $50 grocery bill.

‘I stood there and cried for a second,’ said Tiffany, who admits that the unexpected act of kindness left her almost speechless.

She was so touched by the stranger's generosity that she contacted her local TV news network to speak out about what had happened and to hopefully find out who the lady is.

'She must be just a divine lady,' Tiffany said. 'She must be. I would just love meet her and thank her personally.'

'I'm glad I live in Colorado because we have great people in our state,' she said.
