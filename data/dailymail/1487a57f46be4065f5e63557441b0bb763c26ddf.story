Don't use your mobile phone in public in Rio. And if you do, and someone tries to nick it, don't argue. Muggers often kill victims who resist.

These are the warnings residents in Brazil have offered to football fans who will be heading to their country for the World Cup this summer.

The advice comes as the country was pitched into near anarchy today after thousands of police went on strike to demand a near doubling of pay.

Policemen stand guard inside the Maracana stadium: World Cup travellers have been given fresh warnings over safety in Brazil, as the country's civil police staged a one-day walkout over pay

Muggings, robberies, kidnappings and gang violence make Brazil one of the most criminalised countries in the world, with about 28 murders per 100,000 residents.

Meanwhile, massive inequality and dissatisfaction with authorities have led the Foreign Office to warn travellers that 'protests continue to take place regularly, often without warning,' in major cities.

In travel advice issued last night, the FCO adds: 'Levels of crime and violence are high, particularly in major cities.

'You should be particularly vigilant before and during the festive and Carnival periods,' as well as, presumably, the World Cup.

It's against that backdrop that the nation's civil police, who deal with criminal inquiries, have staged a one day walk out just 22 days before the start of the tournament, one of the world's biggest sporting events.

They are demanding pay rises of up to 80 per cent, BBC News reports.

Officers have withheld their labour in 14 states, including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambuco and Amazonas - all locations of World Cup host stadiums.

But even when police are not staging union action, Brazil's cities can be hazardous to unwary visitors. Tips from embassies, police sources and Rio residents on how to avoid becoming a victim of crime during the World Cup include:

Muggings on public transport, at beaches and in popular tourist areas are on the rise in Rio de Janeiro, reversing recent gains in security as it has geared up to host seven World Cup games and the 2016 Olympics.

Muggings on Rio's bus fleet, the main form of public transport in this metropolis of 12 million, doubled over the past year, the state's ISP security statistics agency says. More than 420 incidents were reported in January alone, compared with 195 in the same month a year earlier, returning such incidents to their peak level of four years ago.

The phenomenon dovetails with a general rise in muggings and robberies. In the first three months of the year, the number of muggings reported in the city's marquee Copacabana district rose nearly 60 per cent in a year.

Commuters ride a bus in Rio: The situation in Rio's public transport has gotten so bad that state lawmakers have proposed the creation of a specialised police battalion for the city's fleet of nearly 9,000 buses

Security expert Paulo Storani, who spent 30 years as a Rio cop, says violent crime has risen in at least half of the 12 World Cup host cities, a rise who attributes to a feeling of impunity.

'People do not recognize the authority of government officials, and as a result criminals are more at ease to commit their crimes because they feel they will not be arrested or punished,' he stold the Associtated Press.

The FCO advises British tourists travelling to Brazil that 'violence and crime can occur anywhere and often involves firearms'. It warns of an increase in robberies at cash machines and calls on holidaymakers to 'be vigilant while using public transport, especially during rush hour.'

The situation in Rio's public 
transport has gotten so bad that state lawmakers have proposed the 
creation of a specialised police battalion for the city's fleet of 
nearly 9,000 buses. Rio Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao reportedly favours 
the proposal but it needs to clear several more legislative hurdles.

Mr Pezao characterized the city's fight against criminality as 'a war.'

Rio state's top security official, Jose Mariano Beltrame, has responded to the spike in crime by beefing up the number of officers who will be on duty during the June 12 to July 13 World Cup by around 20 per cent.

The spike in crime comes despite a six-year-old 'pacification' programme which has brought police to 'favela' shantytowns. The campaign initially saw crime fall, and Rio residents began taking walks after dark again.

But the resurgence in crime is driving many back into a siege mentality and fueling fears of problems when an estimated 600,000 foreigners travel to Brazil for the World Cup.

A team of British police officers will be posted to Brazil during the World Cup.

Six bobbies are being sent to South America 'to offer support and advice to Brazilian police and local authorities' and help protect England fans.

Chief Superintendent Rachel Barber, from South Yorkshire Police, will lead the small team during the tournament, which thousands of British fans are expected to attend.

Deputy Chief Constable Andy Holt, who will be the overall commander from the UK, said: 'British police are among the best in the world at policing football matches and it is testament to their work with supporters' groups and others involved in the game that serious football violence has declined. At the last World Cup in 2010 there were only seven arrests of England fans, none of them for football-related violence.

'It is also important that fans play their part in keeping themselves and others safe - by avoiding protests or confrontation, keeping personal belongings safe and leaving plenty of time to get to match venues.

'Very importantly, if you are the subject of a football banning order, you must surrender your passport to your nominated police station by May 31. If you attempt to travel to Brazil, we will be keeping an eye out for you and in the very unlikely event that you are not picked up at a port or airport, our intelligence team in Brazil will spot you and there will be serious legal consequences.'

It's not just robberies that have made public transport in Rio dangerous.

A year ago, the gang rape of an American student aboard a public transit van made headlines around the world. The student and her French boyfriend hailed the van in Copacabana.

The van's driver, money-taker and another man soon forced the other passengers to disembark, tied up the Frenchman and subjected the woman to what a police investigator described as an all-night-long 'party of evil'.

Although investigators quickly tracked down those responsible, it emerged that police had failed to follow up on earlier reports by Brazilian women who were raped by the trio under similar circumstances.

The issue of sexual violence in public transport captured headlines again earlier this year, this time in Sao Paulo, which is hosting the World Cup's opening match.

Authorities there detained several men for allegedly accosting women on subways and buses, sometimes filming them with cellphones and posting the videos of the molestations on social media.

Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first woman president, said on Twitter that such acts 'shame our society.'

While it's unclear if the rate of sexual assault has increased in the past year, the high-profile attacks have fueled the widespread perception that using public transport is dangerous.  

Repeated industrial action by the very men and women who are supposed to be keeping Rio's streets safe has not helped.

However, it is only the civil police who will not be working today.

Brazil's highly armed military police, who patrol the streets, and its federal police, in charge of borders and airports promise they are not planning any strike until after the World Cup.

And the government pledges that even it they did walk out, authorities have contingency plans in place.

Brazil's Big Events Secretary Roberto Alzir told the BBC: 'There is no climate for a general [police] strike now in Rio de Janeiro.

'Even if that was to go ahead, we would be prepared for that.'

Brazilians have high hopes that the World Cup will give their country a big boost.

That includes soccer fan Jarbas Meneghini, a 46-year-old mechanic who has carved out a side business of making replicas of the tournament's iconic trophy.

Mr Meneghini came up with the idea as he watched now retired soccer star Dunga holding up the World Cup trophy after Brazil won it in 1994.

Nice little earner: Mr Meneghini, 46, holds replicas of FIFA World Cup trophies which he has made and sold since since 1996, after he saw former soccer star Dunga holding up the trophy in 1994 tournament

Mr Meneghini shows a drawing of Argentina's former soccer star Diego Maradona at his home: He produces small version of the World Cup that he sells for the equivalent of $11 and a large one that goes for $23

He started selling his replicas two years later and he's still at it, producing a small version that he sells for the equivalent of $11 and a large one that goes for $23.

Most of his sales are done by phone or through his Facebook page. Sometimes he delivers orders to clients by meeting them during games at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium.

Mr Meneghini doesn't say how many he has sold, other than to say sales have been slow. He says he has used part of the proceeds to fix up his street so it will look nice during the World Cup.

Another benefit, he says, is that his replica business led to him meeting Brazilian national team coach Felipe Scolari as well as players.

His most prized posession is one of his replicas that soccer star Neymar autographed. That one he plans to keep.
