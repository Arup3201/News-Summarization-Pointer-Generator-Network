Medic: Capt Bruce Kevin Clark died under unknown circumstances on Monday at an army base in Afghanistan

Foul play is not suspected in the death of an Army captain who died in Afghanistan as he chatted with his wife on Skype, the military reiterated on Monday.

Army investigators found no bullet wound in Bruce Kevin Clark's body and they believe he died of natural causes.

Despite this, his wife, Susan Orllana-Clark, insists her husband was shot. He lurched forward when he died and that she saw a bullet hole in the closet door behind him, she says.

For two hours, she and friends in El Paso, Texas, frantically tried to get help for Capt Clark as they watched him die on an open video link, nearly 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan.

The Army is waiting for the results of an autopsy to formally determine the cause of death, however, they have dismissed Mrs Clark's assertion that the Army nurse's death was suspicious.

Christopher Grey, a spokesman for the Army Criminal Investigation Command, said Monday that the only evidence of trauma was a broken nose he sustained when he fell forward. An autopsy is being done to determine the cause of death and the investigation is still under way, Grey said.

'But the important thing is that there was no bullet wound, no trauma,' Grey added.

'We can positively say that Captain Clark was not shot,' he later said in a statement.

His wife, Susan Orellana-Clark, made a statement on Sunday saying she doubts that assessment.

'(Capt) Clark was suddenly knocked forward,' Mrs Clark said in remarks released by her brother.

'The closet behind him had a bullet hole in it. The other individuals, including a member of the military, who rushed to the home of Capt Clark's wife also saw the hole and agreed it was a bullet hole.'

Mrs Clark sat in in El Paso, Texas, and watched the computer screen helplessly for two hours on Monday as she frantically tried to contact her husband's colleagues 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan to get him help.

Finally, two Army personnel arrived in 
Capt Clark's room and checked his pulse. They did not, however, tell Mrs
 Clark what had happened to her husband, the family said.

A spokesman at the William Beaumont 
Army Medical Center in Texas, where Capt Clark was stationed, told MailOnline on Friday that the officer's death came from natural causes and was not combat-related or 
suicide.

Mrs Clark said she decided to go 
public with the bullet hole detail 'to honor my husband and dispel the 
inaccurate information and supposition promulgated by other parties.'

Cpt
 Clark was chatting online with his wife, he suddenly looked 'alarmed' 
and disappeared from his wife's computer screen during a conversation on
 Monday, according to an Army spokesman.

'Mrs Clark was Skypeing from the family home here in El Paso with her 
husband when he all of a sudden fell away from the computer keyboard and
 fell out of sight,' said Colonel John Modell.

'He assumed an alarmed look and fell back out of the picture,' he continued.

Clark
 was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso and
 deployed in March. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, aged 
three and nine.Â

U.S. and Australian special operations soldiers in Afghanistan honored Clark this week, according to the statement.

Clark was assigned to A Company, Troop Command at Beaumont.

According to the El Paso Times, his 
awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Award, Military 
Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Medal.

On Thursday night flags flew at half-mast in the Addison, Michigan, area where his mother Cindy Hallenbeck lives and a donation jar with his picture on it was set out by a local store.

A Facebook page has been created in Clark's honor and tributes have been flooding in.

A friend wrote on his Facebook page: 'The love Bruce had for his wife and girls is what I remember the most. He was a string nurse who was always a team player. We will miss him! Just consider myself lucky to have met him.'

Patricia Robledo wrote: 'The love Bruce had for his wife and girls is what I remember the most. He was a string nurse who was always a team player. We will miss him! Just consider myself lucky to have met him.

Former Addison firefighter Ed Lawson wrote: 'More than just helping me learn the ropes at the (fire department), he helped me learn that being strong and being compassionate can go together.

He never knew it but in his way, he also helped me find my way back to God. Awesome man, husband and father, friend who is missed already.'

Shortly after moving to Spencerport in 2000, Clark and his wife had a daughter. As he worked as a volunteer firefighter, Clark enrolled at The College at Brockport, where he decided to pursue a career in nursing.

When he was approached about joining the military, he decided to pursue both passions as he 'really wanted to serve his country'.

After graduating in 2006, Clark moved his family to Hawaii, where he was stationed. There, he had another daughter. His next assignment was in El Paso, Texas. He rose to the rank of Captain and Chief Nurse, according to YNN.

His sister-in-law Mariana told the news channel they are still in the dark about what happened: 'There really still is a big question mark.

'On Tuesday, military called my sister and told her that Kevin had not made
 it, and that there would be an investigation and that was the only 
thing they would tell her.'

No matter how he died, Mariana knows it was in service of his country; 
putting others before himself. That's the way, she says, he deserves to 
be remembered.

'He didn't want anyone to suffer, and that's what made him an amazing 
nurse. It's what made him an amazing father, brother, husband, and son.'
