Two men have been jailed for five years after a vigilante knife attack on a drink driver who killed a young boy.

Corby Clark, 24, and Andrew Henderson, 44, attacked David Jones in Castlegate, Aberdeen, days after he was released from serving an eight-year jail sentence.

The 30-year-old was jailed in 2004 after admitting causing the death of an eight-year-old boy.

Mr Jones had been drinking fortified wine Mad Dog 20/20 before getting behind the wheel of the car and crashing into a wall on a country road.

He left Stephan Henderson - the son of a friend - dying on the ground after he pulled him from the wreckage and fled the scene.

Two other boys, aged 11 and 12, were also injured in the crash.

Clark and Henderson admitted on Wednesday to attacking Mr Jones two weeks after he was released from jail at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.

Fiscal depute Anne MacDonald said: 'The complainer Mr Jones was 30 at the time of this incident.

'He had shortly before this incident been released from prison. That incarceration in prison was with regard to a road traffic incident involving a child.

'The sentence was a sentence of eight years in prison in respect of causing the death by dangerous driving of that child.

'This is necessary background to explain something of the reason why this incident occurred on the 23rd of August. The child was the son of Mr Henderson’s partner at that time.

'When the death occurred Mr Henderson, not surprisingly, was upset but unfortunately did not seem to be satisfied by the term of imprisonment imposed by the state and decided to take the law into his own hands which he thought was some sort of revenge.'

A judge said that Henderson did not agree with the term of imprisonment and 'took the law into his own hands'

The court heard that Mr Jones was released from prison on August 3 and had been out drinking with friends when he was attacked.

Ms MacDonald said: 'He felt a few blows then something across the back of his head then ended up on the ground.

'He recognised Mr Henderson straight away and when he was on the ground he felt he was being assaulted. The complainer was on the ground and suffered the attentions of Mr Henderson with the knife.'

The court heard Mr Jones was attacked with a Stanley knife and suffered serious cuts to his face and ear. He was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery on his face but will still be left with a 'significant' permanent scar.

Yesterday Clark admitted injuring Mr Jones by kicking him repeatedly on the body. And Henderson plead guilty to striking him on the head with a knife to his injury and disfigurement.

Defence solicitor John Hardie said the craft knife had belonged to Mr Jones and was taken off him during the attack in the city centre on August 23 this year.

He said his client Henderson had spotted Mr Jones in the Castlegate area and had 'wrestled' him to the ground.

He said there was significant history between the two men who had known each other before Mr Jones was jailed.

The court heard that Mr Jones had been a family friend of Mr Henderson’s then partner, who he split up with after her son’s death.

Sheriff Edward Savage described the case as an 'extremely serious offence' and said he was satisfied that a custodial sentence was inevitable.

He jailed Clark for 27 months and sentenced Henderson to 36 months in prison. Both men were described as prisoners in court papers.
