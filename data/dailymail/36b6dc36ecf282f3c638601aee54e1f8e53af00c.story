The un-PC police commissioner: Paris Brown, 17, posted foul-mouthed rants boasting about her sex life, drug taking and drinking binges

Britain's first youth police commissioner was facing urgent calls to quit last night after she tweeted a torrent of foul-mouthed rants boasting about her sex life, drug taking and drinking binges.

Paris Brown, 17, also posted violent, racist and anti-gay comments.

She was appointed last week to the £15,000 taxpayer-funded post to represent young people’s views on policing.

But politicians last night insisted that her position was untenable after her disgusting outbursts were revealed by The Mail On Sunday.

In one she appears to condone 
drug-taking, revealing: ‘I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.’ 
Elsewhere she complains: ‘Worst part about being single is coming from a
 party/night out horny as f*** and having to sleep alone.’

Another says: ‘Been drinking since 
half 1 and riding baby walkers down the hall at work oh my god i have 
the best job ever haha!!’ And in one vile message, she says: ‘i want to 
f****** cut everyone around me.’ Elsewhere she rails against gays as 
‘fags’, immigrants as ‘illegals’ and travellers as ‘pikeys’, while 
admitting she has ‘a thing for older men’ – an apparent reference to a 
teacher at her former school.

Just
 two months ago, Miss Brown wrote: ‘F****** hell why are the people from
 Direct Pizza so difficult to talk too!! IT IS CALLED ENGLISH. LEARN 
IT.’

And she attacked the 
male actors in the reality show Made In Chelsea, writing: ‘Everyone on 
Made in Chelsea looks like a f****** fag.’

In the months leading up to her 
appointment she repeatedly demonstrated her apparent disdain for the law
 and propensity to anti-social behaviour.

Just three weeks ago she appeared to 
support an apparent assault, saying: ‘I don’t condone violence but im so
 pleased that my brother thumped the fat little ****.’

Describing
 herself in one tweet, she said: ‘im either really fun, friendly and 
inclusive when im drunk or im an anti social, racist, sexist, 
embarrassing a****** often its the latter.’

And in another she boasted: 
‘am getting so drunk this saturday, so so painfully oh so unattractively
 drunk.’ The comments come from a personal Twitter account, Paris 
@vilulabelle, where she had posted or circulated more than 4,000 
messages and images, many of them offensive.

Yet
 only days ago Miss Brown pledged in a series of television interviews 
to change perceptions of young people who, she insisted, were mostly 
‘lovely’.

Miss Brown’s 
comments represent a further blow to police credibility, which was 
undermined last week by The Mail on Sunday’s disclosures about WPC Kelly
 Jones, who sued a burglary victim after tripping over a kerb at his 
petrol station.

Miss Brown was hired to cover Kent and
 was interviewed by the county’s assistant chief constable. It was hoped
 the appointment would be a blueprint for the rest of the country. But 
that plan lay in tatters last night.

Miss
 Brown reports to Ann Barnes, 67, who was elected to the £85,000 role of
 Kent Police and Crime Commissioner last year. PCCs were elected in 41 
police forces in England and Wales in November and each one has control 
over the budget and policing priorities in their area.

Keith
 Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select committee, said: ‘I am
 deeply shocked by these disclosures.

This individual must be removed 
from their post immediately. Public money should never be given to 
anyone who refers to violence, sex, drunkenness and other anti-social 
behaviour in this offensive manner. The Government must now reconsider 
its point blank refusal to publish a national list of all the 
appointments made by Crime Commissioners – as requested by my committee.

‘The public has a right to
 know who they are, how they were appointed and their full backgrounds. 
That is the best way to stop irresponsible and unsuitable people being 
taken on.’

However Mrs Barnes defended her young adviser, and insisted that she should remain in her post.

‘You cannot condone any offensive tweets and I certainly would not accept anything like that now that Paris has been appointed but I wanted somebody for this job who was a typical teenager,’ she said.

She added: ‘There is no way I would think of removing her from her post and I am sure Paris will learn from this mistake and be able to move forward to making a success of the role like I know she will.’ Miss Brown, who is not old enough to vote or legally purchase alcohol, was chosen from 164 hopefuls who applied for the position that was advertised in February this year.

She was encouraged to apply for the role by bosses at Swale Borough Council in Kent, where she earns £2.65 an hour in a full-time apprenticeship role as an office junior.

The final part of the selection process involved an interview with Mrs Barnes and Lee Russell, the Chief Inspector of Kent Police.

After being appointed, Miss Brown who lives at her family’s £250,000 home in Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey, with her mother Debra, 48, father Dennis, 51 and three brothers, Ross, 23, Miles, 20 and ten-year-old Mason, said the job would help her be the ‘messenger’ for young people.

Miss Brown claimed that she chose to put on hold plans to do A-levels to take up the year-long post.

However
 in another posting she told of her intention to work as a holiday rep 
on the Greek island of Kavos or the Spanish island of Ibiza, both 
renowned for their hedonistic, party atmosphere.

Creating
 a youth police and crime commissioner role was a manifesto pledge of 
Mrs Barnes, who said: ‘Young people don’t have much of a voice in 
policing in Kent and I’m determined to change that.

‘Paris
 is going to be the young face of policing in the county and I’m quite 
sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect
 with young people.

‘She’s very exceptional. She has a real commitment to working with young people. She’s confident and she’s got bags of energy.’

But Miss Brown appeared to be aware that her personal tweets could be damaging to her professional reputation.

Her comments and Twitter account were deleted yesterday, after the Mail on Sunday contacted her.

And last week she started an official @YouthPCC Twitter account and a new personal account, @parisbrownn, explaining to friends that the accounts would be used ‘for work’. Last night Miss Brown told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When I tweet I do often exaggerate and, to clarify, I am not racist or sexist but I’m not going to lie – I have been guilty of showing off in the past.

‘When I sit indoors with my mum I will have a small glass of wine every now and again but I’m not an alcoholic.

‘You are allowed to drink at home. At a family meal or maybe at Christmas I will have a glass of wine or maybe a Malibu and lemonade but I don’t have a drinking problem, I don’t condone drinking to excess.

‘I have never taken drugs and I don’t condone anyone taking drugs. The tweet I wrote about making hash brownies is actually a line from a Scooby Doo film and not something I would ever do.’

Mrs Barnes added: ‘Paris may have in the past been stupid and made some spur of the moment comments which I certainly do not condone but she has matured quickly into a very confident and mature young woman.

‘I am sure she will be ashamed of these comments but I would bet you that any parent who accessed a Twitter or Facebook account would be surprised and perhaps shocked at some of the stuff that’s on it because that’s what kids do.

‘They like to impress their mates and I imagine Paris has been found guilty of boasting in many of these messages.’
