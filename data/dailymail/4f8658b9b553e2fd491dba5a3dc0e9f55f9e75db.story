England shift their World Cup preparations up another gear on Wednesday night as they take on Ecuador at Miami's Sun Life Stadium.

It's the first of two warm-up friendlies Roy Hodgson's team will play there this week, with Honduras to follow on Saturday.

Here's our lowdown on the Ecuador team that will line-up against England.

Match details

The match kicks-off at 8pm UK time (3pm Miami time) and will be screened live on ITV. There will be a live blog on Mail Online Sport if you're not near a TV.

It is at the Sun Life Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins NFL team and former home of the Florida Marlins baseball team. It has hosted five Super Bowls and two baseball World Series in the past.

When soccer games are staged there, it has a capacity of 74,918 but only 10,000 are expected for the England vs Ecuador game.

Local interest is low because the 3pm kick-off clashes with work and not too many England fans have travelled over, preferring to save their money for the World Cup in Brazil.

Are Ecuador in the World Cup?

Yes they are. They finished fourth in the South American qualification group, behind Argentina, Colombia and Chile, after taking 25 points from 16 matches.

'Home advantage' gains a new definition when it comes to Ecuador, as they play their games in Quito, 9,300ft above sea level up in the Andes.

It is the highest capital city in the world and their opponents don't like visiting. In the qualification campaign, they won seven and drew one of their matches there (Argentina earned a 1-1 draw).

When they go down the mountain, Ecuador are nowhere near as effective - in qualifying, they lost five and drew three on the road.

They've been paired with Switzerland, Honduras and France in Group E and will fancy their chances of progressing to the knockout phase.

They open against Switzerland in Brasilia on June 15, then play Honduras in Curitiba on June 20 and France in Rio de Janeiro on June 25.

What's their World Cup pedigree?

Ecuador have qualified for the World Cup finals on two previous occasions. They made their bow in 2002, losing to Italy and Mexico before beating Croatia in Group G.

Returning in 2006, wins over Poland and Costa Rica were enough to see them out of Group A behind hosts Germany.

As you'll probably remember, England knocked them out in the last 16 thanks to David Beckham's second-half free-kick.

Who's in the final 23 for Brazil?

Coach Reinaldo Rueda named his final squad list on Monday following a friendly with Mexico over the weekend.

He included Segundo Castillo in the 23 despite the midfielder needing another three weeks to recover from a knee injury sustained in that match.

The coach considers Castillo, a veteran of their last tournament back in 2006, an essential part of his team though he might not see any action after taking a nasty knock on the knee in the clash that saw Mexico's Luis Montes break his leg.

Rueda's only surprise pick is the 19-year-old Stuttgart midfielder Carlos Gruezo.

What kind of form are they in?

Ecuador have played three matches this year, with varied results.

They stormed back from three goals down to beat Australia 4-3 in a friendly played at The Den back in March, held Holland to a 1-1 draw in the Amsterdam Arena last month and then lost 3-1 to Mexico in Arlington, Texas on Saturday.

Who's the boss?

57-year-old Colombian Rueda took charge in 2010. He guided Honduras to only their second-ever World Cup but came in for criticism for the tactics he deployed out in South Africa and subsequently stepped down.

He negotiated Ecuador to the finals in Brazil without any trouble and now he will be expected to at least match their run to the Last 16 back in 2006.

Rueda was asked about the threat posed by Wayne Rooney in Wednesday night's match but he chose to concentrate on the collective.

The boss: Reinaldo Rueda has been Ecuador manager since 2010

'Their team is at a tremendous level throughout, so it's not just about one player,' he said.

'Rooney is a goalscorer and a leader, we know that, but England have Gerrard, they have Lampard, they have Welbeck, they have Smalling.

'Rooney is Rooney, but we focus on the collective and they are a strong side.'

Which players will I recognise?

Antonio Valencia is the name that leaps from the Ecuador teamsheet.

The Manchester United winger continues to delight and infuriate the Old Trafford faithful in equal measure - in some matches, his pace and crossing can be a real weapon; in others, he barely registers.

Valencia, 28, contributed four goals and six assists for United last season, a pretty dismal return for someone of his ability. If Ecuador are to make waves in this tournament, they need their captain and talisman to be at the top of his game.

You might also remember Felipe Caicedo, the striker who made a few appearances for Manchester City after moving from Basel for Â£5.2m in January 2008 but spent most of his time out on loan.

He's still only 25 but now plays for Al-Jazira in the United Arab Emirates after a two-year stop-off at Lokomotiv Moscow.

Who else should I look out for?

Jefferson Montero's stock rose back in November when Valencia said he wouldn't mind if Man United signed him.

The winger is well travelled for his 24 years, with 39 international caps and eight goals to his name. Having been unable to hold down a first team place during his two seasons at Villarreal, Montero now plays for Mexican side Monarcas Morelia.

The aforementioned Castillo, 32, spent some time in England on loan at Everton and then Wolves while playing for Red Star Belgrade and now plays for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia.

Everton fans may remember his one and only goal for the club, a 25-yard volley against Standard Liege in a 2008 UEFA Cup tie.

Christian Noboa, another midfielder, plays for Dynamo Moscow and has been in Russia for seven years now. The 29-year-old won two Russian league titles with his former club Rubin Kazan and played in the Champions League.
