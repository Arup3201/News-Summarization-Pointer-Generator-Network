The reign of the winningest female contestant in Jeopardy! history has come to an end.

Julia Collins, 31, lost during her 21st appearance on the pre-taped episode that aired Monday. The Chicago-area resident accumulated a total of $428,100 during her 20 victories on the syndicated series.

Collins was vanquished by Brian Loughnane, an investment operations manager from Scituate, Massachusetts. Collins went into the final-question showdown in second place, bet everything and lost it.

Loughnane, who is from Ireland, won $22,600.

The clue that stumped her: The New England writer who in 1999 became the last person to win an Oscar for adapting his own novel as a screenplay. She failed to answer with the correct question: Who is John Irving? His novel and film are titled The Cider House Rules.

Monday's game overall 'just didn't go my way,' Collins said in a phone interview, adding, 'I couldn't have loved being on the show more.'

Host Alex Trebek's salute to Collins after her streak ended: 'Well done, young lady.'

Collins said she was glad her record might serve as an example of female achievement.

'If it helps dispel the idea that women aren't as good Jeopardy! players as men, that would be great,' she said. 'It's good to see women being applauded for being smart.'

Winning streak: Collins' reign on the show ended with the question: The New England writer who in 1999 became the last person to win an Oscar for adapting his own novel as a screenplay?

Correct: Ireland's Brian Loughnane answered John Irving for his novel and subsequent screenplay The Cider House Rules

Her winnings helped finance a dream 
trip to Paris, where she rented an apartment for a month. Some may fund 
future travel adventures, Collins said.

The management consultant, who's been enjoying a hiatus thanks to Jeopardy!" said she plans to get back into the work world.

The
 previous top female player for consecutive wins was Stephanie Jass, who
 took seven games in a row in season 29. Collins displaced her and 
Larissa Kelly, who was No. 1 in total winnings with $222,597.

Collins holds the No. 2 spot for most consecutive wins behind all-time Jeopardy! champ Ken Jennings. He won 74 straight games in season 21 for a total prize of $2.5 million.

She is the third-highest money winner for non-tournament play on Jeopardy! behind Jennings and Dave Madden, who won $430,400.

Future Jeopardy! contestants might want to consider her advice: Practice your buzzer technique so you can beat out your usually-knowledgeable competitors, and restrain yourself from guessing at answers.

And stay calm.

'I was more relaxed than I thought I would be' when she first played, Collins said. 'I thought I was going to have a little "deer in the headlights" experience. ... I tried not to put too much pressure on myself, not worrying about things I don't know. '

Collins will be back for the Jeopardy! tournament of champions next season.
