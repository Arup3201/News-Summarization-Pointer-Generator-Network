Tired of getting a chilly reception on vacation?  Then how about a trip to Iceland?

The tiny, glacier-covered nation perched in the freezing Norwegian Sea boasts the friendliest people in the world, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Meanwhile those wanting to go on holiday to cheer themselves up would be well-advised to stay away from Bolivia, whose inhabitants rank as the world's least-friendly towards foreign visitors.

This map ranking countries from red (most welcoming) to pale blue (least) shows the top 20 friendly countries in the world.  The UK comes 55th and the US 102nd

The U.S., meanwhile, comes a pretty unfriendly 102nd (out of 140 nations) on the welcoming scale, while the UK does quite well, coming 55th in the list, despite its stiff upper lip reputation.

The list of countries ranked for friendliness comes from the Forum's newly-released Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, which gave scores on a scale from one, where locals made foreign visitors feel 'very unwelcome', to seven, for 'very welcome'.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given its reputation for having chatty inhabitants who enjoy a bit of 'craic', Ireland made the top ten, coming in at ninth place with a score of 6.8.  Meanwhile Canada, which is also known for the friendliness of its people, came 12th, with a score of 6.6.

But it is Iceland, with its tiny population of 319,000, where temperatures hover at around zero at this time of the year, where visitors will be assured of the warmest welcome.

America's position so far down the list, when it is know for its people telling visitors to 'Have a nice day!' is a surprise.  But few would have expected France to come higher than its position of 80th on the list, particularly the Brits, who often encounter a certain froideur on holidays across the Channel.

The top ten nations in order of their friendliness to visitors from elsewhere are: Iceland, New Zealand, Morocco, Macedonia, Austria, Senegal, Portugal, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland and Burkina Faso.

The bottom ten, meanwhile, were 
Mongolia, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic, Pakistan, Iran, Latvia, Kuwait, 
Russian Federation, Venezuela and Bolivia.

Foreign visitors to Bolivia may not find the warmest welcome, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum

Bolivia, home to the Death Road from La Paz to Coroico (the world's most dangerous road) also boasts the world's least friendly people, according to a new report

Despite the freezing climes, the people of Iceland are a friendly lot who will give the international visitor a welcome as warm as their hot springs
