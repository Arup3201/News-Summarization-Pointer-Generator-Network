The super-cuteness of Nemo, the beloved clownfish made famous in Pixar's delightful film Finding Nemo, is being used to highlight what Greenpeace says is a potential environmental disaster on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

Greenpeace Australia Pacific has released a controversial advertisement which features a clownfish stuck swimming in a blender as part of its campaign to stop what it claims is a 'monstrous new mine' in Queensland, which will require a shipping terminal in the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef.

The 30 second video, which was uploaded on YouTube on Tuesday, has since gained more than 29,000 likes.

Finding Nemo opened to universal acclaim in 2003, earning US$936 million. The animation is based in Australian waters and begins with Nemo jumping from a fish bowl in a dentist's surgery and into Sydney Harbour.

The Greenpeace clip begins with a close up on the little clown fish swimming around in what initially seems to be the ocean.

'Life for this fish was, quite literally, going swimmingly,' the video description reads.

However as the camera pans out, it becomes evident that the clownfish is trapped inside a blender.

The campaign is a protest against the approval of the Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin, west of Rockhampton, in far North Queensland.

The narrator of the footage explains that the new mine, owned by coal giant Adani, will require a shipping terminal in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area and threaten the lives of sea creatures like this clownfish.

'Right now a proposal to build the largest ever coal mine in Queensland threatens our Great Barrier Reef,' he said.

'How much will we destroy in pursuit of profit and power?'

Ben Pearson, program director of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, says this was a fresh and confronting way of reminding people that threats to the Great Barrier Reef 'remain and are still very real'.

'It the biggest mine in Australia is approval by the Environmental Minister, about three million tonnes of sea-floor will be dredged and dumped into our Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area to make way for the new coal terminal,' he said.

'The clownfish has become iconic in our reef campaign.'

The final scene ends with the sound of the blender being turned on, implying that Nemo has finally faced his fateful tragedy.
