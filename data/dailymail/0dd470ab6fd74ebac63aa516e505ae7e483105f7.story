Two men have been convicted of trafficking and raping eight teenage girls after they groomed them online, took them to hotels and plied they with alcohol.

Yasir Ali, 28, and  Daaim Ashraf, 19, are now facing jail after they were found guilty of a total of 24 charges at Cambridge Crown Court today.

During the eight week trial the court heard how the pair, who are both from Peterborough abused the vulnerable girls, who were aged between 13 and 16 at the time of the allegations, between 2008 and 2013.

Guilty: Daaim Ashraf, 19, (left) and Yasir Ali, 28, (right) were convicted of exploiting vulnerable teenage girls for sex at Cambridge Crown Court today

Jury members were told that Ali and Ashraf had abused the girls who they had groomed after 
meeting them through social media.

Six of the victims were abused at a 
hotel in Peterborough in January and February last year. One of the 
girls was also raped in an alleyway in Stamford.

A further two victims were identified 
during the investigation and disclosed to having been raped in cars at 
Ferry Meadows in 2008 and 2010.

The girls were traced after being 
identified as being at risk of being exploited through an information 
trawl by police and Peterborough City Council in January last year.

Ali was convicted of four rapes, seven
 charges of trafficking for sexual exploitation, two charges of making 
indecent images of children and engaging in sexual activity in the 
presence of a child and intimidation.

Ashraf was convicted of five counts of
 trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexual assault, sexual activity 
with a child and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child 
and intimidation.

Ali was cleared of a further count of 
rape from 2008 while a third defendant, James Daly, 25, of Grange Road, 
Peterborough, was cleared of a single charge of rape.

Charges against two other men were dropped earlier in the trial.

The jury of seven women and five men had deliberated for 14 hours and 37 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts.

Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: 'Today’s convictions are part of the ongoing joint inquiry by Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Peterborough City Council’s Children’s social care to safeguard young people and bring offenders to justice.

'The girls were targeted due to their vulnerability and groomed via social media. They were made to feel special.

'These men preyed on their innocence and took them to hotels where they were plied with alcohol then sexually abused.

'They have each been through horrific ordeals and have shown great bravery in giving evidence against their abusers at court.

'It will no doubt take many years for them to rebuild their lives, but hopefully the knowledge that these men have been brought to justice will be an important step forward for them.

'Our priority has always been, and remains, to protect young people. We will continue to work with the city council and other partner agencies to keep young people safe from harm.'

Ali and Ashraf are due to be sentenced next month.
