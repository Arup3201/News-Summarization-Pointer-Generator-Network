Christmas travelers hitting the roads and skies this weekend face tornado warning in the South, severe downpours further north and a thick band of snowy conditions in the Midwest through the weekend.

Major airport hubs from Dallas to Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Boston can expect to be affected by some extreme or another through Monday.

Conditions will begin to calm down by the time the holiday finally rolls around Wednesday, with only parts of the northern Midwest expecting a white Christmas this year.

Soaked: A Batman and some Los Angelenos walk through Hollywood as Southern California got a rare downpour Thursday. A different storm system is set to disrupt holiday travel starting Saturday as the Southeast prepares for severe rain and even tornadoes

Snowy: Traffic slowed to a crawl in Salt lake City Thursday as snow swept the area causing power outages and car accidents. As the weekend wears on, most of the snow will be focused in the northern Midwest states, where roads could be dangerous as holiday travelers prepare for Christmas

On Friday, snow will be the first sign of Christmas travel trouble as it ekes its way in from the Northwest.

Into Friday night, much of the Great Lakes region and into southern Canada and New England will begin to see snow accumulate as much as 6 inches.

Into Saturday, a warm front will fuel rains from Texas, though much of the Southeast and north through Appalachia and into New York State.

Travel could get especially nasty in east Texas, Louisiana and north to the southern tip of Illinois, where severe thunderstorms are expected.

Drenched: It won't be as unusual as it is in Los Angeles (pictured), but folks from Texas to southern Illinois can expect exceedingly wet conditions through the weekend

Dangerous: Millions of travelers are hitting the roads and skies this weekend. But Saturday, the weather calls fro dangerous thunderstorms in much of the South, with potential for tornadoes in some areas

Mixed bag: The outlook is good and bad on Friday, when travelers in the West and Southeast can expect good conditions, while the north and Southwest have a tough road ahead

Snow: A band of snow can be expected from Michigan to Maine on Friday, with more to come towards Christmas itself

Frigid: Wet snow falls in Salt Lake City on Thursday when a winter storm battered northern Utah causign power outages, traffic accidents, and the temporary shutdown of the Salt lake City airport

nasty: Much of the Great Lakes region can expect the same as Salt Lake City (pictured) into the weekend, threatening to interrupt holiday travel plans

A winter storm blasted the Wasatch Front resulting in numbers crashes including these two cars that collided during the treacherous drive in Salt Lake City on Thursday

There is even potential for tornadoes in those areas through Saturday night.

Even where tornado warnings are unlikely, the Southeast and much of the Midwest can expect to be drenched into Sunday.

The East Coast can expect an unseasonably warm weekend with temperatures reaching the 60s.

Remnants of the massive storm due to soak the center of the country will creep east and cause some rain closer to the coasts late in the weekend.

The warm temperatures will melt away any East Coast snow left over from Thanksgiving, such as in Boston where residents spent the weekend blocking parking spaces they'd spent hours shoveling with things like trash bins, lawn chairs and vacuum cleaners.

However, snow is in the forecast into the holiday week for much of Michigan and in parts of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

White Christmas for some: As the east feels the last of the storm's rain into Wednesday, much of Michigan and the Great Lakes region will see a white Christmas along with Colorado and Kansas

Not the greatest: Travel will be better in the Midwest by Monday, conditions will remain poor on the east Coast and Northeast

I called it: Every winter, following a snow storm, the tradition of marking the parking space that one has shoveled with a disposable object continues in Boston neighborhoods. This most recent storm's snow will melt into the weekend as unseasonably warm weather moves across the East Coast

Savesies: A chair, spray painted with the home address number is left in a shoveled parking space on a public street in the South Boston neighborhood

Enjoy it while you can: An old vacuum is left in a shoveled parking space in the South Boston neighborhood. Rains will gradually replace the dry, warmth the East Coast can expect for the weekend

Bad reception: An old television set marks another parking spot in Boston. Arguments sometimes result over cleared public parking spaces including the arrest of a 32-year-old man in the alleged assault of a 66-year-old neighbor after the last snowfall
