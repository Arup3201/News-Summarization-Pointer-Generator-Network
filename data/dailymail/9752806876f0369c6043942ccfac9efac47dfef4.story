The Serbian made 44 appearances in all competitions for City last season and was a key figure for Manuel Pellegrini's side as they lifted the Premier League title.

Kolarov said: 'I am very happy and very proud of this new contract. I will give this club probably the best stages of my football career and I am very happy that I continue with this club which feels now like my home.

'Last season I played a lot and I think I proved to people in the club that they can believe in me and the result was that I was offered a new contract and I was happy to sign.

'When we won two trophies last season, I was happy with what we did and I think it’s good for the club and for me that we are here now.

'I think we can do a lot more things in the future. We’ve won everything in England and I think we can do a lot more in Europe. So we’ll try to repeat what we did in England and try to win something in Europe. The most important thing in football is the result and I think we can do a lot more in the future.'

Kolarov has made 99 appearances and scored 15 goals for City since moving from Lazio in 2010 for £19million.
