Shocking injuries: 78-year-old Sabina Harrison was left black and blue after an alleged attack in Leeds in broad daylight

This is the shocking image of a grandmother-of-four who was beaten black-and-blue by a gang of thieves who allegedly launched a violent attack on her in broad daylight to steal her handbag.

Sabina Harrison, 78, suffered horrific injuries after she was mobbed by four men while walking to a bus stop in in Leeds, West Yorkshire, leaving her shaken and scared to leave her home.

She said: ‘I had gone out to see my sister and was just walking along the road minding my own business when all of a sudden I was grabbed from behind.

‘They went for my bag but it was over my shoulder and I had it wrapped around my hand so the more they pulled it, the more it tightened around me.

‘They kept on until they got me on the ground and then they dragged me along the floor.’

Mrs Harrison, who worked in the catering industry before retiring, suffered bruising across the entire left side of her body as a result of the alleged attack.

She said: ‘I have two artificial hips so I was very worried about them.

‘It happened so quickly and I didn’t get a look at them. It was just the last thing I expected.

‘I didn’t have anything valuable in my bag so I don’t know why they targeted me. I want to just forget about it all and not let this beat me.’

Police have released the photograph of Mrs Harrison’s injuries to encourage the public to help their investigation and have arrested four youths in connection with the attack.

Now Mrs Harrison’s family are calling for people to take responsibility to protect the vulnerable.

Mrs Harrison’s daughter, Sabina Halliday, says more needs to be done to prevent such attacks.

Investigation: Police wish to speak to the occupants of a VW Golf that which was seen on CCTV at the time as they may have witnessed the incident

She said: ‘We want to prevent this from happening to someone else.

‘As a community in the city, we need to make sure that our vulnerable people are safeguarded so that they aren’t afraid of going outside in daylight.

‘We can’t turn the clock back - but those who were involved need to learn that this is not acceptable.’

Mrs Harrison was walking through Harehills on her way to catch a bus when she was allegedly targeted by the gang in Milan Road at about 5.20pm on Friday, February 28.

Passers-by called emergency services and Mrs Harrison was taken to hospital.

Mrs Halliday added: ‘I was the first person from our family to see her and I was very shocked. I knew that she had been mugged and had a fall but I was quite alarmed when I saw the extent of her injuries.’

She said her mother had not been out of her house alone since the incident and still required regular hospital check-ups.

Mrs Halliday said: ‘Her face was very swollen. And the doctors suspected she may have fractured some of the bones in her face, but because of the swelling they couldn't pick this up on X-rays, and they thought it wasn't worth putting my mum through it again as they probably wouldn't do anything.

‘But more than the physical injuries, it's the emotional ones she's been left with. Hopefully she'll get back to herself but it will take time to build her confidence again.’

PC Philip Dodsworth, of Leeds District CID, said: ‘We hope the impact of this image will encourage anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.’

Police are especially keen to talk to the driver of a Mark IV Volkswagen Golf which was seen on CCTV at the time who may have witnessed the incident.
