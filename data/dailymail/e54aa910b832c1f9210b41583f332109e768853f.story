It turns out Santa Claus doesn't get a well-deserved break once the holiday season ends. 

Jim Fletcher, a retired engineer, has become a local celebrity in his hometown of Houston, Texas, where he dresses as Father Christmas - and keeps up the act - almost every day of the year.

It's all for a good cause, as he brings joy to children whose families have been affected by natural disasters across the US.

Along with 180 other Texas-based Santas, Jim Fletcher brings toys to children affected by natural disasters

The 74-year-old, better known as Santa Jim, is famous around his native Houston, Texas

Along with his wife, Madge (known as Mrs. Claus), the pair keep up the festive act all year long

'Most people would like to call me Mr. Fletcher, but that's not very Santa-like, I don't think,' the jolly man explains.

Along with his wife, Madge, who is also known as Mrs Claus, the couple maintains its festive alter-egos all year long.

And it takes a lot to maintain oneself as a full-time Santa.

Mr Nelson has his own stylist, who he visits four times a year, a personal trainer and an extensive wardrobe made up almost entirely of red items.

'I don't leave the house if I'm not wearing red on something,' Jim explains. 

Santa Jim is careful to never leave the house without wearing at least one item of red clothing

Jim Fletcher also has a personal trainer and a stylist that he visits four times per year

And, of course, Santa Jim also has a sleigh to deliver gifts to children - but his is a large truck

Why does the retired engineer do it? He's part of the Lone Star Santas Organisation charity

He also has a sleigh of his own, which is, in true Texas-style, a red pick-up truck.

But all the work is worth it for the sweet man, whose true passion stems from helping others through The Lone Star Santas organisation.

Santa Jim - and approximately 180 other Texas-based Santas - bring toys and hugs to children around the country whose families have been affected by natural disasters and other devastating losses.

'We certainly aren't the first responders - we're too old and fat for that,' he says with a smile. 'But we're second or third.'
