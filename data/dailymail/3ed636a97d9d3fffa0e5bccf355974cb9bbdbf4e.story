Prince, once the undisputed king of sleazy pop, has vowed that he will no longer use rude words in his music.

The singer, who turns 56 next month, features on the cover of June’s Essence and told the magazine that he had decided once and for all that it is disrespectful to use bad language in front of women and children.

‘Did you ever hear Muhammad Ali curse?’ he said. ‘Would you curse in front of your kids? To your mother? Marsha [Ambrosius], Lianne [La Havas], Janelle [Monae] … They’re all my sisters. We shouldn’t curse at them. We need to treat all of them, and all people, like royalty.’ 

Mind your language: Prince has vowed that he will no longer use rude words in his music because it is disrespectful to women and children

In his 80s heyday Prince was notorious for using fruity language in a host of sexually explicit songs including Erotic City, Head, Darling Nikki, Come, ***y Control and Scarlet ***y.

His 1992 single Sexy M.F. caused controversy with its chorus line ‘You sexymotherf****r’ and an edited version, ‘Sexy Mutha,’ had to be created for radio and the music video.

But since becoming a Jehovah's Witness in 2001, Prince has avoided playing any of his old songs that feature dirty words.

The singer recently signed a deal with his old label Warner Bros. Records to digitally re-master and re-release his classic albums.

A 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of Purple Rain is expected later this year and it isn’t known if the singer will go as far as bleeping the swear words on it.

Album track Darling Nikki was about a young girl masturbating in a hotel lobby, while Erotic City - the B side of Let’s Go Crazy - featured liberal use of the F-word.

It was hearing her daughter listen to Darling Nikki in 1985 that prompted Tipper Gore, wife of then Sen. Al Gore, to go before Congress to urge warning labels for records marketed to children.

The industry developed the Parental Advisory labels as a result.

Prince is scheduled to release his 33rd album, Plectrum Electrum, later this year.

Despite burying the hatchet with his old record company, Prince still has some strong feelings about record company executives.

In Essence, dubbed the Prince After Dark issue, Prince criticizes the heads of major labels, who he says are always at the beach.

'Middle of the afternoon. What are you doing? "Oh, I’m at the beach with my kids,'" he told the magazine.

'So we’re working to send their kids to college. And to the beach. We’re not supposed to accept that.'
