Beating: The soldier was allegedly attacked by two corporals from the 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales Royal Regiment

A soldier who survived a tour of duty in Afghanistan was allegedly beaten senseless by two British army corporals inside a military base.

The 22-year-old was pulled out of his bed and hit with a chair for 25 minutes.

The young serviceman was hospitalised following the attack in military accommodation in Paderborn, Germany.

The fight allegedly happened after a row over buying drinks in a bar, the Sun reported.

The soldier apparently refused to buy the two corporals a beer and a row followed.

He was later attacked in his accommodation block at the base.

The soldier has since been flown back to Britain where he is still receiving treatment.

He had to have a tracheotomy - a pipe inserted into his throat - to help him breathe following the beating.

He apparently crawled out of the window to escape the two corporals who launched the attack.

Attack: The soldier survived a seven month tour of duty in Afghanistan but was attacked at a British military base

The squaddie headed patrols in Nad-e Ali, Afghanistan, during a seven month tour of duty.

But after surviving unscathed, he was attacked at a British military base last Friday.

The incident is being investigated by the Royal Military Police and the attackers face being arrested and court-martialed.

The corporals who allegedly carried out the attack last Friday are from the 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales Royal Regiment.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said today: 'Anybody that is found to have committed an offence or fallen below the standards expected of them will be subject to disciplinary action.'

Discipline: The military court at the base in Sennalager, Paderborn, Germany. The two corporals accused of attacking the squaddie face arrest and a possible court martial
