He showers her with attention and pays for two personal maids to provide 24-hour care for her at his mansion in Paris.

He admits he dotes on her so much that she is like a ‘kept woman’.

Now Karl Lagerfeld has claimed that he would marry his pet cat if he could.

Pampered: Feted feline Choupette is the famous pet cat of Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld

The 77-year-old fashion guru said that he never thought it was possible to love 22-month-old Choupette as much as he does.

German-born Lagerfeld’s devotion to the white siamese is the stuff of legend even within the excesses of the couture industry.

Showered with affection: The Chanel designer said in an interview he would marry his cat Choupette if he could

Choupette (the name is said to be 
French for Herbie) dines at her owner’s table on her own special pillow,
 has been pictured with her personal iPad and has a Twitter account with
 more than 27,000 followers.

It describes her as ‘a famous beauty who 
refuses to eat on the floor & my maids pamper my every need’.

There is also a Facebook site in her 
name, with 1,276 ‘likes’, or friends, by last night. It pictures her 
about to tuck into a king prawn cake to celebrate her first birthday 
last August.

Lagerfeld is so enamoured of the animal that her eyes are 
said to have been the inspiration for a cornflower-blue couture 
collection for Chanel, the fashion house for which he is head designer.

When Lagerfeld is not at home the 
maids, apparently named Francoise and Marjorie,  write down everything 
she does in little books so he can catch up on it later. Choupette is 
said to prefer Francoise of the two women.

In a TV interview Lagerfeld said that, much to his disappointment, there is ‘no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals’.

He added: ‘I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat.’

Lagerfeld adopted Choupette a year 
ago after looking after her for a friend for two weeks.

He refused to 
give her back, and the pair have been inseparable ever since. The cat 
has even starred in her own film for the luxury fashion website 
Net-a-Porter.

Lagerfeld has described Choupette’s 
coat as ‘snow white with touches of caramel around the eyes, ears and on
 her endless boa-like feather tail’. In an interview with Harper’s 
Bazaar he revealed that when Choupette fell sick he summoned a doctor in
 the middle of the night because he could not bear to wait until 
morning.

Choupette is brushed twice a day, 
every day, and is given regular manicures. Her favourite activities 
supposedly include running around, chasing big fleas in her private 
garden and tearing up pieces of paper.

The most special moments for 
Lagerfeld, he says, are when she gets on his papers while he is working,
 or when she brings all her toys to his bed as a present for him.

Lagerfeld is renowned for his 
eccentricities, and in one period is said to have lost 90lb by drinking 
nothing but Diet Coke and eating stewed vegetables.
