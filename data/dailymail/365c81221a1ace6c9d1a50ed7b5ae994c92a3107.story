Killer and rapist: Jorge Torrez has indicated that he would rather face the death penalty than trial for the murders of two Illinois girls in 2005 and laughed when he heard one of the girl's father's was convicted of the killings

An ex-marine charged with fatally stabbing and raping two young girls in 2005, might never stand trial for their killings - and laughed when he was told the father of one of the children wrongly spent five years in prison for the crime.

Illinois native, Jorge Torrez, was found guilty earlier this month of another murder - that of Navy sailor Amanda Snell - and has refused to defend himself as the jury decides whether to sentence him to death or life without parole for that crime.

Indeed, as part of that process in the Virginia court room, the jury heard the frantic and horrifying 911 call made by the wrongly imprisoned Jerry Hobbs, after he discovered the mutilated bodies of his daughter, Laura Hobbs, 8, and her friend Krystal Tobias, 9.

That horrifying crime occurred in Lake County in Illinois and authorities there are keen to have Torrez stand trial - despite his insistence on being put on death row.

The Virginia court were shown graphic pictures of the crime scene and heard Hobbs, who is now, 43, moaning in the background after he and Laura's grandfather, Art Hollabaugh, made the gruesome discovery in a nearby park.

Hollabaugh traveled to Virginia to speak at the sentencing hearing of Torrez on Tuesday.

Guilt: Torrez is charged with the killing of two young girls in 2005 in his hometown of Zion — 8-year-old Laura Hobbs (left) and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias (right)

Wrongly conviction: Jerry Hobbs had pleaded not guilty in the stabbing deaths of his 8-year-old daughter, Laura, and her friend, 9-year-old Krystal Tobias in Zion, about 50 miles north of Chicago - but a jury decided otherwise after he confessed after an alleged case of police brutality

'Jerry started screaming that he found the girls and they were dead,' Hollabaugh said according to the Chicago Tribune.

'I told him 'No, they're not.'

Judge Liam O'Grady then cautioned jurors they were about to see 'disturbing' images.

Authorities in Illinois initially charged Laura's father with the killings, after prosecutors say a 20-hour interrogation yielded a false confession. But DNA evidence eventually led authorities to Torrez.

Torrez has ordered his lawyers not to fight prosecutors' case for execution.

Asked if Torrez was now welcoming the death penalty, his lawyer said to the court on Tuesday: 'That is a fair and reasonable deduction.'

He said Torrez continues to maintain he did not kill Snell, 'but he understands he has been convicted and he will either spend 60-odd years of his life locked away in a supermax (prison) or he gets the death penalty.'

Family grief in 2005: Prosecutors alleged Hobbs killed them because he was angry his daughter was outside when she was supposed to be home. Police said Hobbs confessed to the slayings, but his attorneys said the confession was coerced

Earlier this month, a jury in U.S. District Court in Alexandria convicted Jorge Torrez, 25, of killing Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell in July 2009.

Both lived in the barracks on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington County.

Torrez is already serving a life sentence for abducting three women in Arlington, raping one of them repeatedly and leaving her for dead.

He is also charged in the killing of two young girls in 2005 in his hometown of Zion — 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias.

Laura’s father, Jerry, was originally charged in that case and spent five years in custody until the DNA evidence pointed to Torrez. Hobbs said he was coerced into a false confession. Illinois prosecutors are still waiting to put Torrez on trial.

Denials: Jerry Hobbs vehemently denied the brutal killings and was freed in 2010 by a court in Illinois

Torrez was only 16 at the time of the girls’ deaths.

Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim said he wants to try Torrez for the Zion killings as soon as possible.

The case should be tried locally in “the interest of justice,” Nerheim said.

'The alternative would be for me to simply dismiss this case, and two little girls lost their lives as a result of his conduct,' Nerheim said.

Snell’s murder went unsolved for nearly two years.

Even though she was found stuffed into a wall locker with a pillow case over her head, the medical examiner did not rule her death a homicide, and the autopsy found no signs of sexual assault.

After Torrez was arrested in the Arlington abductions in 2010, DNA evidence through semen connected him to the slayings in Illinois and to Snell’s murder. Torrez lived eight doors down from Snell in the barracks.

Scant consolation: Jerry Hobbs received a payout of $8 million for his wrongful conviction - but his daughters killer may yet not see trial

Jurors also heard recordings of a confession Torrez made to an inmate who was acting as a confidential informant.

The same informant told police that Torrez laughed when he was told that Hobbs was convicted of his own daughters murder and that of her friend.

Despite his confession, Hobbs always maintained it was beaten out of him by police.

At the time of his release in 2010, the-then Lake County State's Attorney Michael Waller said he was not convinced that Hobbs didn't have a role in the killings, but he said he didn't believe the case could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Regardless, Hobbs received $8 million in compensation in 2012 for his wrongful conviction and imprisonment.

In 2005, investigators quickly decided that Hobbs was the prime suspect after he discovered both the girls face up and side by side in Beulah Park in Zion the day after Mother's Day.

Hobbs, who had recently been released from a Texan prison had a history of drunken violence - including a rampage with a chainsaw in a trailer park in 2001.

After a 20-hour interrogation, Hobbs signed a statement admitting to the killings, according to court records. He later recanted.
