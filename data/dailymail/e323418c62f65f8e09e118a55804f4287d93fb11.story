Rwanda has accused the BBC of 'genocide denial' and called for the corporation to be banned from the country after it aired a controversial documentary that questioned official accounts of the horrors of 1994.

'Rwanda's Untold Story', broadcast this month, highlighted growing criticism of President Paul Kagame and alleged that his Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) — then a rebel group, now the ruling political party — was behind the shooting down of a presidential plane that triggered the genocide.

The Hutu community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of Tutsi population in 1994, when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the Holocaust in the Second World War.

But the BBC's programme included interviews with two American researchers who suggest that thousands of Hutus could have been killed too, possibly by RPF forces. It claimed a UN report expressing similar concerns had allegedly been suppressed.

Genocide: The Hutu community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of Tutsi population in 1994, when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the Holocaust in the Second World War 

Disputed: Official accounts hold that the Hutu-led government allowed and sanctioned its militias to conduct these atrocities, wiping out 20 per cent of the country's entire population in the process

Militia: Official accounts hold that the Hutu-led government allowed and sanctioned its militias to conduct these atrocities, wiping out 20 per cent of the country's entire population in the process. But the BBC documentary suggested many more Hutus may have been killed by Tutsi militia (pictured)

Belgian historian Prof Filip Reyntjens even tells the programme that Kagame could be one of the 'most important war criminals still in office today'. 

Now furious lawmakers in parliament have now called for the FM licence the BBC uses to broadcast across the country — in English, Kinyarwanda and French — to be pulled and the programme's producer and presenter be charged with genocide denial, a punishable crime in Rwanda. 

'We must stand and fight against these deniers,' Senate President Bernard Makuza said, according to the New Times newspaper. 'Among the decisions we should consider is taking a legal action against the deniers, be it internally or externally,'

'We should as well consider revising the agreements Rwanda has with BBC. This is an open struggle that cannot be taken lightly and should be taken on by everyone collectively.' 

'Genocide denial'? Earlier this month, president Paul Kagame (pictured with British prime minister David Cameron in 2007)  told parliament that the BBC had chosen to 'tarnish Rwandans, dehumanise them' and accused it of 'genocide denial'

Horror: Ethnic Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front troops look over a pile of skulls dug up to be reburied in a memorial for approximately 12,000 Tutsi massacred by Hutu militia in and around the western town of Kaduha 

MP Julienne Uwacu said Rwandans should 'switch it off completely', the New Times added.

Earlier this month, Kagame told parliament  that the BBC had chosen to 'tarnish Rwandans, dehumanise them' and accused it of 'genocide denial'. 

Marie Bamutese was one of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees brutalized and chased across Rwanda and into the Congo by forces that the BBC claimed were allied to President Paul Kagame.

She told the programme how she witnessed the repeated bombing of Hutu refugee camps allegedly by Kagame's artillery and the remains of Hutu refugees piled up like a moutai. 

She told how she saw her own grandmother die of physical exhaustion before her own seven-year-old cousin, Elodie, died on her back as she carried her though the forests to escape the massacres.

Perhaps most shockingly, she even described how her mother was forced to cut a deal with a local family, allowing Marie to be raped in exchange for safe passage out of the country.

She told the programme: 'I can not explain what it is like to see children die like flies. One day I sat next to two dead children. I felt nothing. I felt dead with them in the forest.'

Later she adds: '[The Tutsi militia] killed all the refugees ... it was necessary to kill the greatest number of Hutu refugees ... and they were killed because they were  so many. '

Prominent international academics, experts and diplomats have echoed his comments, accusing the BBC of being 'recklessly irresponsible' by allegedly promoting a revisionist account of the genocide in the documentary.

'We urge the BBC to apologize for the offence this program has caused for all victims and survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,' they said in a statement.

The documentary producers are accused of attempting to acquit the Hutu militia and reduce the number of Tutsi victims. According to the experts, the film-producers tried to decrease the number of Tutsi killed from 1 million to 200,000 and raise the number of Hutu victims.

'They even claim that in 1994 more Hutu than Tutsi were murdered – an absurd suggestion and contrary to all the widely available research reported by Amnesty International, UNICEF, the UN Human Rights Commission, Oxfam, Human Rights Watch, Africa Rights, a UN Security Council mandated Commission of Experts and evidence submitted to the ICTR and other European courts who have successfully put on trial several perpetrators,' the experts claimed.

Kagame was himself asked about the programme during an appearance at the thinktank Chatham House in London this week. 'For me as a Rwandan and the leader of Rwanda, I just wish we could concentrate on development of our country and being the best for our people,' he said. 'The BBC can say whatever they want to say. They don't have to say or do, whatever they do or say, because that is right. They say or do whatever they say and do because they can.'

The documentary suggested that President Paul Kagame ordered the downing of the plane of former President Juvenal Habyarimana, the act that is believed to have sparked the genocide.

But Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo branded the documentary  an 'attack on Rwanda and its people' and said that her government is contemplating taking action against the BBC.

'My government reserves the right to respond, on its own timing, in a manner commensurate with the weight of the offense,' she told The Associated Press.

The BBC, one of the country's most popular broadcasters, said the programme in 'no way' sought 'to downplay or conceal the horrifying events of 1994' and subsequent events and denied that any part of the programme constitutes a 'denial of the genocide against the Tutsi'. 

It said: 'There are repeated references to the mass killings of Tutsis by Hutus in 1994 and that this constituted genocide. The programme also includes an interview with the director of the Genocide Museum at Murambi, a Tutsi and genocide survivor, and a convicted Hutu genocidaire who spoke of his part in the killing of thousands of Tutsis.

'The BBC has a duty to investigate difficult and challenging subjects and we believe the programme is a valuable contribution to the understanding of the tragic history of the country and the region, and of the governance of Rwanda over the last 20 years.'

The corporation also said there had been several attempts to ask the Rwandan government to respond to the allegations but in vain. 

Students also marched through Kigali on Wednesday demonstrating against the BBC.

In 2009, Rwanda temporarily banned the BBC's Kinyarwanda broadcasts over comments also concerning the genocide.

David Mepham of Human Rights Watch wrote this week: 'These admirers – and others – seem to be willfully ignoring the darker side of Kagame's record in office. Rwanda under Kagame has no tolerance for dissent or political opposition … Scores of Rwandan journalists have fled the country, unable to report freely and fearful for their safety.'
