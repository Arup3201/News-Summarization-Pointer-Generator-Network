San Francisco Giants pitcher, Chad Gaudin, 30, is accused of groping a woman's breast at a Las Vegas hospital. He was 'ill at the time', according to his lawyers

A San Francisco Giants pitcher accused of groping a woman's breast at a Las Vegas hospital was 'ill at the time', according to his lawyers.

According to police reports Chad Gaudin, 30, 
appeared drunk when he approached a 23-year-old woman on a gurney at 
Desert Springs Hospital, told her she was gorgeous and touched her face 
and breast.

A paramedic who witnessed the 
incident told Gaudin to leave the woman alone, but he refused, and 
security staff held him down until police arrived, the report said.

The baseball player was arrested in January and was charged on July 3 with 'open and gross lewdness'.

An officer wrote in the report:Â  'I asked Gaudin several times how he ended up at the hospital and each time he told me that he didn't know.

'Gaudin appeared to be intoxicated. He had slurred speech, bloodshot 
eyes, trouble standing still, obeying commands, an odor of alcoholic 
beverages and couldn't repeat his house number, where he lives, the same
way twice in a row.'

But Gaudin's lawyer, Dominic Gentile, has issued a statement saying his client denies any wrongdoing and has been cooperating with authorities.

'Chad Gaudin was examined in the emergency room of a local hospital while experiencing symptoms believed to be related to acute renal failure due to a condition known as rhabdomyolysis.

'The symptoms included confusion, dehydration and loss of orientation and/or consciousness,'

'Although he has been accused of improperly touching another hospital patient while on the premises that night, there are differing and exonerating versions of what occurred that have been reported by eye witnesses.'

Common causes for rhabdomyolysis include alcohol or drug use, muscle strain, or crush injuries, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Gaudin, who has pitched as a starter and in relief, is 2-1 this year with a 2.44 ERA.

He last pitched against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday, when he got a no decision, going seven innings and giving up a run on four hits.

In his career, Gaudin has pitched for San Francisco, Miami, Washington, Oakland, Toronto, Tampa Bay, San Diego, the New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs. He is a lifetime 42-43 with a 4.46 ERA.

He's married and has one son, according to his biography on the Giants' official website.
