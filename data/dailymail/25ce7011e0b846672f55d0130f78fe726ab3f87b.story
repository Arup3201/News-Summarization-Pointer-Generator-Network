These striking pictures show Iraqi Christians praying for their lives and livelihoods - as just a few miles away, Islamic State militants fight to take both away from them.

The men and women who went to Sunday Mass yesterday at St Joseph Church in Irbil, northern Iraq, form part of a fast-dwindling minority as extremists sweep through their nation enforcing a violent interpretation of Sunni Islam.

Only a thin line of Kurdish fighters, supported by a few hundred U.S. troops, separate them from the violence which has engulfed wide stretches of Iraq, including the city of Mosul 50 miles away.

Praying: Iraqi Christians are under threat from the violent spread of Islamic State militants. Pictured, women pray in a Sunday Mass at St Joseph Church in the Kurdish capital Irbil, which has so far remained untouched

Dwindling: Reports say the number of Christians in Iraq has dropped sharply over the last decade

Militants have threatened those who do not follow their interpretation of Islam with death.

Christians, because of their association with the West, are among the most hated by the Islamists.

Others in peril include the Yazidi people, tens of thousands of whom were besieged on a mountaintop in desperate need of food and water by Islamic State militants.

Many Christians have fled the country in the latest crisis, adding to the numbers which observers say have been trickling out since the 2003 war and the insurgencies that followed.

Reports claimed there were 1.5million Christian Iraqis in 2003, but this number dropped to less than 500,000 last year. Some estimates of the current number have been as low as 200,000.

Minorities: Non-Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the militants, who threaten their enemies with slaughter

Despite the danger, the church remains similar to those in the West, with rounded windows and wooden pews

Others, however, have remained in Irbil. The Kurdish regional capital, which has 1.5million residents, has remained mostly untouched by the militants - but not by the killing sprees they have caused.

Many of what used to be Iraq's biggest Christian strongholds have already been taken by the militants, including the second city of Mosul and the city of Qaraqosh.

Thousands of refugees have flooded into the areas around Irbil, which is home to the sprawling Baherka refugee camp.

More than 1.8million people have been displaced across Iraq since the rapid advance by Islamic State militants first began in January, according to the United Nations.

Even in towns near Irbil which have been seized back by the Kurds, residents are unwilling to return.

One, Gwer, has been left as a ghost town after its 20,000 citizens were too frightened to go back.

Resolute: Many Christians have fled Iraq in the crisis, but others have stayed firmly in cities such as Irbil

Under siege: A recent study shows the extent to which Islamic State militants have swept through Iraq

Kurdish peshmerga forces are left to patrol the streets, where the phrase 'Islamic State' is daubed on many buildings.

In many cases it is misspelled to read Salam State - state of peace - a sign that many of the militants holding the town were probably foreign fighters. 

Irbil is also home to U.S. troops who are bolstering Kurdish forces in their fight against the militants.

Overall around 1,500 U.S. military personnel are in Iraq, many of them embedded with the country's security forces to find targets for air strikes.

The U.S. has launched more than 150 such strikes against the militants, which could be stepped up after the beheading of British hostage David Haines.
