If anyone's nickname is ready for a change, it is Mel B's.

Universally known as Scary Spice since coming to fame in a blur of leopard-print, wild curls and massive platform shoes, the 39-year-old from Leeds has recently undergone a style revolution that surely earns her the new moniker of chic.

The X Factor judge puts it all down to her stylist Jason Bolde, who she says has 'done wonders' with her look.

Chic Spice: The sleek new Mel B wore a stunning white sheer chiffon gown for Sunday's X Factor finale

Mel credits her stylist Jason Bolde, who's taken control of her clothes, for her new   pared-back look 

Until her recent re-entry into the spotlight as talent show judge, Mel had remained faithful to her Scary Spice style roots with plenty of body-con dresses, animal prints, heavy make-up and midriff-baring tops.

Speaking to Grazia, the formidable mother-of-three admitted that Bolde only agreed to work with her when she promised to follow his advice.

‘He wanted to give me a sleeker, more chic look, and he’s done wonders,’ she told the magazine.

Mel says former bandmate Victoria Beckham (here in her new London store) is 'an amazing businesswoman'

As if to prove the point, in the accompanying shoot for the magazine, Mel smoulders in a series of stunning couture gowns, even donning a pair of angels' wings for one picture.

Of late, Mel has appeared noticeably more stylish and pared-back, opting for a shiny bob or hair scraped off her face while clothes are fitted, well-cut and in flattering block colours.

But don't put this down to a case of competition with her fellow judge Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who she describes as 'a strong independent woman'. She said: 'I'm a girl's girl and Cheryl is lovely. How can you not love her?'

The former Spice Girl also expressed her admiration for former bandmate Victoria Beckham's designs, praising her surprising sense of humour.

'She's witty as hell, very funny and an amazing businesswoman. I love her dresses.'

Victoria Beckham has  reinvented herself after leaving the girl-band that made her famous, founding a hugely successful clothing line that's  put her firmly on the fashion map.

Meanwhile, Mel's earned a new generation of fans as the tough-talking  panel member on Simon Cowell's Saturday night singing competition.

From crying at contestant's performances to responding to one fan gushing over Cheryl and ignoring her - 'what am I, chopped liver?' - Mel's authentic demeanour kept viewers tuning in.

The full interview appears in this week’s Grazia magazine, on sale 16 – 29 December. You can hear Mel B’s festive message by downloading the new Grazia Extra app. There’s also a behind-the-scenes video of Mel’s shoot and more exclusive pictures.
