A couple have lost an incredible 13st together after learning to cook kebabs for the very first time.

Katie and Roy Marks, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, lived on takeaways and microwavable food, but after learning to cook their takeaways at home, they have shed the weight.

The pair now cook together every night and are 13st lighter, with Katie, 30, weighed over 22st, but now has dropped to a slender size 12 and 14st, while Roy has gone from 23st to 18st.

The pair used to live off fast food and have at least two 'blow out' take-away meals a week

Their unhealthy diet saw Katie's weight reach 22st and found her wearing a size 26

Katie, a children's nanny, said: 'When we wanted to lose weight we didn't know how to cook it was really embarrassing.

'We used to eat takeaways at least twice a week and the other days were microwave meals so it was really hard to learn.

'I remember the first meal was a home-cooked meat kebab and we made our own chips as well.

'We were really surprised it turned out as well as it did and it tasted so lovely.

'We cook everything together now, with the kebabs a firm favourite, and have lost thirteen stone.'

Katie and Roy, who used to eat at least two blow out takeaways a week, have kept each other going throughout their weight loss.

Katie was prompted to drop from 22st (left) to 14st (right) when she had difficulty conceiving 

Mrs Marks said: 'It has been really supportive having Roy there losing weight with me.

'We've always done everything together, but now instead of just sitting and watching a film together, we walk the dogs and cook together too.

'Every Wednesday morning before I go to weigh at my Slimming World class, Roy weighs himself first so we can do it together, and we measure our waists together too.

'We have never been competitive and it is just a massive support going through it side by side.'

When the couple married in 2007, Katie walked down the aisle in a size 24 wedding dress but was not bothered about her weight.

Katie was told she needed to have a BMI of below 30 in order to qualify for IVF, and now, at 8st less (right) is planning to begin a course and hopefully start a family

Katie said: 'I was happy at the time.

'How I ate and looked was my just my life and what I knew, it didn't affect me at all.'

But when the newlyweds decided to start trying for a baby, their weight became a problem.

Katie said: 'We were back and forwards to the GP as I struggled to get pregnant.

'The doctor said my weight would be contributing to problems with fertility.

Roy lost over 5st by being taught the slimming class lessons by Katie at home when he returned from work

'I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and went on to have four miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy.

'They said I would never be able to fall pregnant by myself naturally. My only hope was IVF treatment.'

But both Katie and Roy were too overweight to have IVF treatment, and their only chance of a baby was too lose weight.

Katie said: 'I had to have a BMI under 30, and Roy under 35, but me being a size 26 and Roy an XXXL, we were nowhere near.'

Katie and Roy knew what they had to do, and decided to lose the weight to have their dream family.

Katie added: 'At first I was too embarrassed to go to classes so I tried to lose the weight at home.

'But over two years I only lost two and a half stone because I didn't know what I was doing.

'I decided enough was enough and joined a Slimming World class.

'Roy works full time so I went to the class and came back to teach him what I had learnt.

'The main thing was to cook everything healthily.

'The first meal we cooked together was Slimming World Kebab meat and we made our own chips as well!

'We had never cooked before so it was really hard to start learning.

'But soon we realised we both loved cooking - maybe things would have been different if we had known this before.

'In just one year I lost 5st 7lb and now I am a healthy size 12, and Roy lost 5st too.

'Now we cook every night together and walk our dogs together for exercise.

'It's been great going through it together and we motivate each other to keep going.

'We have a completely different lifestyle and eat so much healthier.

'The beauty of Slimming World is no food is forbidden it is just all in moderation, we haven't had to say goodbye to take-aways completely!

'It has worked wonders for us and we have never felt happier.'

The couple are now the right weight to undergo IVF treatment and are looking to start their family later this year.
