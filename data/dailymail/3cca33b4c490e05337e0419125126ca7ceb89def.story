One might think it's run-of-the-mill to find Australia’s super cute mascots cuddling each other, but experts say snuggling koalas are no ordinary sight.

Heart-warming images have surfaced of two-year-old koala Max embracing his new treemate Tucker, 18 month old, in the same tree fork.

Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia it was one of the most surprising scenes she had seen in five years on the job.

Taronga Zoo koala keeper Laura Jones told Daily Mail Australia it was one of the most surprising scenes she had seen in five years on the job

‘We brought Max in for the breeding program. The first 36 hours with Tucker were a bit of a rough start, since Max was determined to prove himself as the boss,’ she said.

Two-year-old Max was only recently introduced to the closure, which is usually an aggressive period.  

‘There was a bit of bellowing and tussling for dominance. But it was smooth sailing from then on.’ 

Within 10 days, when the images were taken, Max and Tucker were getting along like a house on fire. 

‘It means they have accepted their hierarchy. They feel comfortable in one another's confines,’ Jones said. 

Max (pictured) had an initially hostile period when he moved into the enclosure with Tucker, but they were pictured sleeping together just ten days later

Jones said koalas are not as cuddly as people think, and they will generally only get close for safety in the wild

‘It was terrific to find them so intimate. There is no way you would find this with fully grown adults. We rarely have males living together at all, so we're all very surprised.' 

Jones said that housing the koala’s together means they can divide the time spent resting and being active for ‘koala encounters’ with members of the public.

‘Max is capable of impregnating the females, so we needed to house him with another boy,’ Jones added.

Jones said koalas are not as cuddly as people think, and they will generally only get close for safety in the wild.

‘The only other time I have found them so intimate was last year, when Tucker snuggled up to Sydney and Milli, two of our female koalas.’

Jones said it is currently koala mating season, meaning those driving around high density areas should watch out for koalas on the roads and be wary of bellowing, their mating call.
