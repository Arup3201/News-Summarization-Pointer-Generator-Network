David Cameron has taken his family on a third holiday of the summer – to a hideaway on the remote Scottish island of Jura.

The Prime Minister spent a long weekend at a sprawling 20,000-acre estate owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor.

The remote home is reachable only by a 20-minute ferry ride, making it an ideal location for a spot of downtime away from prying eyes. With a population of just 200 (as well as 4,000 deer), it is famous for malt whisky, stunning views, pristine beaches – and unpredictable weather.

Unfortunately for the PM, his wife and their three children, they had to endure spells of heavy rain.

The family are due to head south from the Inner Hebrides today to a fourth holiday destination – their now-traditional summer break in Cornwall.

Daughter Florence was born there in 2010 when Mrs Cameron went into labour unexpectedly and they are likely to spend the rest of the week enjoying the outdoor life away from Westminster.

Perhaps with an eye on his image, Mr Cameron is remaining in the UK for his August ‘staycation’.

But the family’s other two summer trips have both been to Europe.

With
the Tories improving in the polls, the holidays have been coming thick 
and fast in 2013. At the end of May Mr Cameron and his family took an 
easyJet flight for a week-long holiday in Ibiza where Mrs Cameron is 
said to enjoy the nightclub music scene.

They stayed in a villa which comes with staff and can be rented for up to £11,000 a week.

Then last month the holiday tour of Europe moved on to another popular hotspot ... the Algarve region of Portugal.

They took another budget airline flight to Faro and enjoyed two weeks in Aljezur.

The solitude and the silence were as seductive as the view.

I was standing on the cliff top at the northern tip of Jura, staring across at rocky Scarba and Mull in one direction and down the strait to  the Corryvreckan whirlpool that almost drowned the writer George Orwell 66 years ago.

To get here we’d crawled and bumped for miles across heather, bracken, bog and streams in an eight-wheeled all-terrain vehicle, glimpsing some of the island’s deer – 20 times more plentiful than Jura’s 200 human settlers, though still hard to spot in an area twice the size of Glasgow.

Buzzards and eagles mewl overhead, adders slither beneath your feet, a wilderness to lose yourself in.

We picnicked in a bothy on the beach where, in 1674, the Macleans of Jura and the Campbells of Mull hacked each other to death.

And we felt as cut off from the modern world as it is possible to be.

There was blue sky (for now – clouds on the way), bright sun (but rain on the way), a cutting wind, of course – that’s how it is in the Hebrides. Changeable, like the economy, like politics.

There’s a sureness about the sun in Tuscany and the Algarve, other holiday destinations favoured by David Cameron. But perhaps his fleeting love affair with remote Jura is because its uncertainties and vagaries are more down-to-earth, more real.

Or perhaps not. I say fleeting because his visit to the island where his in-laws have a holiday home was short, just a weekend before he’s off to crowded Cornwall.

Cameron often waxes lyrical about the island. ‘I fish and try to catch the odd sea trout or mackerel,’ he said. ‘It’s a wonderful place. I don’t mind cold water and there are really beautiful beaches up there.’

Gently shelving into the sea with soft sand dunes behind, those beaches are perfect playgrounds where his three young children can run free, just as my own son did last year.

But talk about beaches may obscure other activities on Jura that the PM is more reluctant to discuss. He has gone out of his way to throw off the image of a huntin’ and shootin’ type (the fishin’ seems not to worry him, though he  says he doesn’t have the patience for it). 

He is known, however, to be an expert marksman, and the vast Astor estate is prime deerstalking territory. It is a pursuit the younger Cameron once relished – though apparently not the raw deer’s liver that was once put in front of him to eat.

He has apparently given up stalking – in which individual deer for culling are tracked and then shot – because it sends the wrong political message, but that won’t stop tongues wagging.

The Astor estate has also attracted controversy because ownership of the land is registered offshore in the Bahamas – the tax benefits of which for his wife’s family could also be something of a political embarrassment.

These issues apart, what troubles me about the PM’s lightning visit to Jura is that, to get the benefit of island life, to drink in its soul-cleansing simplicity (as well as its renowned single-malt whisky), you need to give it time.

Cosy; Inside Tabert Lodge on the Isle of Jura where David Cameron spends his holidays with his family

Time allows you to motor slowly the 30 miles of Jura’s one road, grandly called the A846, as it winds over the craggy hill from the ferry at Feolin and is often little more than a track with passing places.

It passes through Craighouse, Jura’s one-shop, one-pub, one-garage town, dominated by its distillery.

Then it crawls along the west coast before petering out well short of Orwell’s rented cottage, Barnhill, a place judged remote even by Jura’s extreme standards.

To the west of that road is nothing but wilderness, mile after mile of it, soggy with water, riddled with lochs and dominated by the Paps, three round-topped mountains that climbers, walkers and joggers come from across the world to conquer, all three in one day for the most hardy.

On the far side of the island, for the few intrepid souls who reach it, there are nothing but raised beaches formed by the retreating glaciers of the ice age and vast caves gouged out over aeons. 

With all that space and rugged countryside, Jura is a veritable outdoor gym for the athletically-minded. The air is good to breathe and apparently always has been.

Back in 1703 a visitor named Martin Martin described Jura as ‘perhaps the wholesomest plot of ground in the isles or continent of Scotland’.

He was impressed by ‘the long life of the natives and their state of health, to which the height of the hills contributes in large measure by the fresh breezes that come from them to purify the air’.

The island has proved good for the soul, too. George Orwell made the journey here to write in 1947, a city dweller drawn by the solitude.

It took him two days to get from London, his journey ending with a seven-mile walk from the end of the road. The track was so overgrown he had to cut his way through some parts with a scythe.

Once, he went out to sea, misread the tide and wind and was nearly sucked down to his doom in a rowing boat on the  Corryvreckan whirlpool.

He survived to complete his ‘Big Brother’ masterpiece 1984, a grim perspective on the modern world that was perhaps possible to conjure up only in somewhere so apparently ‘uncivilised’.

‘On Jura,’ says the author Robert Macfarlane, ‘Orwell found himself able to think and see differently, roused by the country – harsh, graceful, aerial, marine – that surrounded him.’ 

The solitude of these islands still inspires writers. My novelist wife spent two years on neighbouring Islay. ‘I loved the peace, the freedom to live by my own rhythm,’ she recalls, ‘as well as the extraordinary beauty.’

She is English and was alone but no one meddled or interfered, except with friendship, bowls of unsurpassed Scotch broth and a dram.

As far as local people were concerned, she was just the writer who lived in the old gamekeeper’s cottage. It was a relief to be away from urban living to something altogether simpler.

There is a magic that draws some people – us included, as often as possible – back to our Hebridean haunts. It’s not for everyone. The insularity can turn in on itself, the very remoteness a curse rather than a blessing. Most islanders will confess to cabin fever at some stage or another.

Some leave for good. But generally those who grew up on the islands or have been bitten by the bug return to the tranquillity, the cosiness, the sense of purpose.

Island life is not idyllic. It can be pretty hard at times, with driving rain and cold winds in the winter, and plagues of midges descending on any patch of bare skin in the summer.

Yet the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. ‘It moved me, saddened me, engaged my imagination and touched my spirit’ was how my wife put it.

You don’t get that from a fleeting visit, Mr Cameron.
