Manchester City have asked to be kept informed on developments with Marco Reus at Borussia Dortmund. 

The 25-year-old has a £20m release clause that kicks in next summer and has refused to sign a new contract.

Reus has not played since damaging his ankle ligaments during Germany's European Championships qualifier against Scotland last month, and also missed the World Cup in Brazil through injury.

However, City are not the only suitors for Reus with Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal also keen on the winger.

City also want to sign a striker in January as well as hoping to recruit a young left-sided centre-back with Matija Nastasic expected to move on. 

The 21-year-old has fallen down the pecking order at the Etihad Stadium following the summer arrival of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto.
