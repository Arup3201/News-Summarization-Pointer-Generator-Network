A teenager with a nut allergy died after eating ribs from a Chinese takeaway, an inquest heard.

William Luckett, 15, was unaware that the BBQ sauce was prepared with peanut butter.

After a few bites he began struggling to breathe, the Isle of Wight Coroner’s Court heard. William was taken to hospital by ambulance but died shortly after.

His father Steve Luckett, 45, told the court how he 'cradled' his son as he lay dying.

'He
 kept saying, "sorry, sorry" as if he thought he had done something 
wrong,' he said. 'I reassured him and told him everything would soon be 
fine.

'I tried to keep him conscious but he stopped breathing. He was really white.

'The ambulance arrived soon after. I picked him up and cradled him I told him how sorry I was that this had happened.'

The inquest heard how William, of Newent, Gloucester, often ordered BBQ ribs and had never suffered a reaction from them in the past.

He was staying with his father on the Isle of Wight in December 2012 when they ordered a meal from the local restaurant, the Hong Kong Exress.

While the restaurant’s menu included a general warning that its food may contain nuts, no specific warning was made to the dish.

William’s mother Helen Stiles said her son was first diagnosed with the allergy aged six but had never needed to use his Epi pen, which is used to treat anaphylaxis.

Senior coroner Caroline Sumeray said while an Epi pen may not have saved William’s life, the case highlighted the need for emergency medication to be carried at all times by those with allergies.

She went on to describe the teenager as a 'wonderful son' who was much loved by his family.

A conclusion of death by anaphylaxis caused by a peanut allergy was recorded by the coroner, with traces of peanut butter found in the sauce.
