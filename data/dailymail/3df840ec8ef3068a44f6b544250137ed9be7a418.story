US tycoon Donald Trump struck the first ball on his new luxury golf course in Scotland on Tuesday, teeing off in a ceremony alongside golfing great Colin Montgomerie.

However, the real estate mogul looked decidedly stout as he hit the green, wearing a pair of belted khaki trousers and a white golf shirt.

Trump has famously dated only svelte, stunning women, often years his junior. Included in that list is former wife Ivana Trump, former first lady of France Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and actress and socialite Marla Maples.

But slower metabolism may be catching up with the 66-year-old real estate mogul, who has often been the butt of comb over and self-tanning jokes.

The Trump International Golf Links, situated at Menie, north of Aberdeen on the east coast of Scotland, cost more than $155million to build.

Bagpipers escorted Trump and 2010 European Ryder Cup captain Montgomerie to the first hole, where the businessman cut a ribbon on the first tee before taking a swing.

'We have built something that some people have already said is perhaps the greatest golf course in the world,' he said.

'It's something that's going to be very special. What's good for golf is good for Scotland because Scotland is the home front for golf.'

Environmental campaigners opposed the construction of the course on protected sand dunes.

Trump himself complained about a potential offshore wind farm being built near the site.

The course will open to the public on Sunday, with a private events being held this week.

Sandy Jones, chief executive of the Professional Golfers' Association, and George O'Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, said they would work to bring major golf events to the course.

'It is an honour for me to be here... to witness this marvel that we have here in Scotland and it makes me very proud to be a professional Scottish golfer,' Montgomerie said.
