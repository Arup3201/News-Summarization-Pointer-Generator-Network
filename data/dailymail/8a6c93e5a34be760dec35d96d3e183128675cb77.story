When his US Army commission came to an end, Jim Wolf slipped from a life of action to a life of alcoholism and destitution.

His wholesome complexion grew sallow, his cheeks became lost behind a scraggly beard and a mop of tangled of hair.

He lost his home forcing him to wander from boarding house to doorway as he descended deeper into the abyss.

But the former soldier, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, has turned his life around after being given a complete makeover by christian support charity Dégagé Ministries which 'offers help and hope to homeless and disadvantaged individuals in our community'.

Turmoil: When his US Army commission came to an end, Jim Wolf slipped from a life of action to a life of alcoholism and destitution

Makeover: But the former soldier, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, has turned his life around after being given a complete makeover by christian support charity Dégagé Ministries

Styled out: Armed only with a pair of scissors, a comb, clippers and some dye, stylist Anna Walt attacks his hair, snipping, buzzing and colouring.

Moving: The profoundly moving video, directed by Rob Bliss, began with Wolf sitting in a chair looking at the camera in a grubby t-shirt and tracksuit

And while such internal struggles can take a lifetime to turn around, it took just three minutes to turn Wolf from hirsute hobo to handsome city slicker.

The profoundly moving video, directed by Rob Bliss, begins with Wolf sitting in a chair looking at the camera in a grubby t-shirt and tracksuit.

Then, armed only with a pair of scissors, a comb, clippers and some dye, stylist Anna Walt attacks his hair, snipping, buzzing and colouring. 

Metamorphosis: Gradually his tousled locks are replaced by a crisp short-back-and-sides and his beard reduced to designer stubble

Colour: Ms Walt then attacks his hair with dye

Gradually his tousled locks are replaced by a crisp short-back-and-sides and his beard reduced to designer stubble.

Bliss then puts him in a sharp suit and tie and the metamorphosis is complete.

Wolf, who had not seen himself 
throughout the transformation, said 'wow' when a full-length mirror was 
turned toward him and he finally saw his reflection.

The emotion in the room palpable, Wolf turns to Bliss and gives him a big hug.

'The homeless are people we ignore every day,' Bliss told The Blaze. '[But] they can look like they’re meant for the cover of GQ — they have that potential too.'

Almost complete: Bliss then puts him in a sharp suit and tie

He said he was struck by how quiet Wolf was during the process.

'He was a huge talker,' Bliss said of the man’s personality. 'But I was amazed that he was silent through the process.'

'We all have an image of ourselves,' 
Marge Palmerlee, executive director of Degage, told The Blaze. 'When he 
saw the difference, he just … felt very enlightened and uplifted. I 
could just tell the difference in Jim.'

Silent: Bliss said he was struck by how quiet Wolf was during the process when he was so talkative beforehand

Job done: While such internal struggles can take a lifetime to turn around, it took just three minutes to turn Wolf from hirsute hobo to handsome city slicker

Emotional: The emotion in the room palpable, Wolf turns to Bliss and gives him a big hug
