Newcastle are in talks with former Arsenal player and Lyon coach Remi Garde to take over as head coach – with the man once famous for being Arsene Wenger’s first signing in English football now favourite to take over the job from Alan Pardew.

Stand-in coach John Carver has been told to take the job for another week but with Garde, who quit Lyon at the end of last season, ready to take charge immediately he is moving ahead of candidates such as Saint Etienne boss Christophe Galtier, who has said he won’t move until the summer.

Garde won the French Cup during his team at Lyon and is close to Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr, who will have a big say in whom owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley appoint.

He is willing to work as a head coach rather than manager – but ultimately Newcastle will have to decide whether they are prepared to wait for Galtier at the end of the season. 

Carver, whose team went down 2-0 to league leaders Chelsea on Saturday, still wants the job full time and said: ‘I still haven’t had a conversation with Mike but I’ve have a conversation with Lee and he said: “Look after the game against Chelsea and possibly Southampton” and that’s what I’ll do.

‘Now that this game is out the way we’ll have tomorrow off, we’ll be back on the training ground on Monday and until I’m told otherwise I’ll prepare for the next game. I’ve no idea when they’ll make a decision but if the guys play like they did today then hopefully they’ll make the right decision.’

Garde and Galtier have long been admired from within St James’ Park – but Galtier will not walk out on his current contract in France. ‘I will stay here until the end of the season, that's for sure,’ said Galtier, whose side are currently fourth in Ligue 1.

‘I have no intention of leaving the club during the season. It would be a lack of respect towards the club, the directors. But from there to say that I'll stay until the end of my contract… things happen quickly in football. At the moment I'm really enjoying working here, but one day it will end. But I'm very clear about things.

‘It will end on good terms, properly, with a lot of respect and consideration from all parties. Afterwards I'll go to work in a place where I'll find the same atmosphere, that's very important for me.’ 

Galtier’s decision to stall, however, could cost him his shot at the Newcastle job.
