Mr Trump will name the second golf course at his resort for his Scottish mother, Mary McLeod

American billionaire Donald Trump will name the second golf course on his Scottish estate after his late mother, Mary McLeod.

U.S. Apprentice star Mr Trump has confirmed the second 18-hole facility at Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, will be called The 
McLeod Course, as a tribute to his mother, 
who was born in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.

The first site opened last summer, despite objections from locals. Mr Trump told the Press and Journal: 'It was a very easy decision for me to make.

'My mother loved Scotland and I wanted to create a lasting tribute to her.

'We have a lot of land and we are going to do our very best to make the second course as good as the first.'

On the resort's website, Mr Trump 
states: 'She grew up in a simple croft until she landed in Manhattan at 
the age of 20 and her first language was Gaelic.'

He made the announcement even as he continues to fight proposals for 11 giant turbines off the Aberdeenshire coast, which Mr Trump says will spoil the view from his golfing resort.

The billionaire believes the structures, each as high as a 64-storey building, will besmirch the unspoilt landscape surrounding the £750million, 1,200 acre complex.

In the past Trump’s lawyers have threatened Scottish agencies supporting a potential offshore wind farm being built near the site of his golf resort.

As well as the second 18-hole links golf course, Trump hopes to build a five-star hotel, luxury holiday homes and a residential village.

He added: 'But I won't build it, if the view is ruined by the monstrosities which are going to ruin Scotland.'

The golf course, which opened last July, has been beset by controversy.

The property magnate has been accused of bullying local people into accepting his plans.

In October, You’ve Been Trumped, a documentary by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter chronicled the tycoon’s battle against residents, was shown on BBC 2.

In December the resort was battered by North Sea storms, causing a large chunk of pathway to fall away.

The collapsed path, near the fourth tee, had been covered in neatly trimmed turf but now lies exposed to the elements with pipes running out of the ground.
