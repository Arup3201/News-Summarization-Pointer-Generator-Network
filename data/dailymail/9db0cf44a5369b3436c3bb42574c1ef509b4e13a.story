Jenna Miscavige left the church in 2000 and praises Leah for getting out for the sake of her young daughter

She says the church would usually try to 'smear' defectors but is now 'struggling'

She has told of her traumatic childhood amid the murky realms of Scientology – prompting her to flee the church when she was 20.

And today the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige has revealed he will be extremely unhappy by the departure of King of Queens star Leah Remini – as it is ‘definitely not good PR’ for the organisation – adding: ‘PR for the most part is all they care about.’

Jenna Miscavige, an outspoken critic of the religion – having once dubbed her uncle David ‘evil’ - told MailOnline: ‘I’m really happy for Leah. I think it took a lot of courage on her part to do this so publically. It's fantastic.'

Happy, now: Jenna Miscavige, the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige, seen here with her young son Archie and husband Dallas, today said it was 'fantastic' news that Leah Remini had quit the Church

Kept from her parents: Jenna Miscavige has told how she was parted from her parents when she was just 12

Speaking exclusively, Jenna, 29, a third-generation Scientologist who left the organisation when she when she was 20 in 2005, added: 'It’s fantastic that she got out – but to me, the best part is that she has a young daughter and it’s great she won’t have to be brought up in the church.

‘Scientology definitely does use 
families in order to get people to do what they want them to do, they 
know people care and love for their families.

‘So if they have to use the threat of possibly losing them in order to get them to tow the line they’ll do it.’

 'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda'

Jenna
 said she had met Leah once, and when asked how her uncle would take the
 news of her departure, she replied: ‘I’m guessing not very well! ‘There are so many things going on for the church right now and this is just another thing.

‘It’s definitely not good PR for them – and PR , for the most part is all they care about.'

The daughter of Elizabeth and Ron Miscavige, Jr. Jenna was subjected to a childhood in the teachings of Scientology - and was separated from her parents from the age of 12.

Now a happily married 
mother-of-two living in San Diego, California, with her husband Dallas 
and their two children three-year-old Archie and 13-month-old daughter 
Winnie, Jenna said: ‘I think Leah’s brave, I’m really happy for her.

'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda.

‘I
 can imagine it’s been very stressful for Leah. But the Church is 
struggling – in the past they would smear defectors and say bad things 
about them, now people know these tactics.

Troubled: Jenna Miscavige released a book on being brought up in Scientology earlier this year. She managed to finally leave the church when she was 20.

‘I think more recently they’ve got stuck in a weird place where they think ‘do we smear them or do we not?’

‘I do think now it’s easier than ever to leave. It’s
 becoming easier and easier to become vocal about the church, and look 
at the all celebrities leaving like Lisa Marie Presley, Katie Holmes and
 Paul Haggis.

‘All those people leaving makes it easier for Leah to go too. Good for Leah.’

At the age of seven, Jenna was admitted to the Sea Organisation, the branch of Scientology's most dedicated followers - and was forced to sign a billion-year contract that bound her immortal spirit (known as the 'Thetan' to a life of dedication to the Church.

In April, she told the Independent: 'Looking back I feel completely brainwashed. I didn't even know what I liked or what sort of person I was. I was just a robot of the church.'

Despite her tender age, Jenna was forced into gruelling labour for several hours a day from the age of six to 12, including digging trench holes for irrigation and rock hauling.

And between the ages of 12 and 18, Jenna saw her mother only twice and father four times. They then left the religion when she was 16 – while she chose to stay behind, admitting she knew nothing else at the time.

Actress Leah,43, made her dramatic break from the church this week. She had been a member for three decades - and is one of Scientology's most famous faces.

Missing: Scientology leader David Miscavige has failed to answer questions about the whereabouts of his wifeShelly, who has not been seen in public since 2007, according to writer Tony Ortega's Scientology-focused website, The Underground Bunker

The star, who is married to  Angelo 
Pagan, with whom she has a nine–year-old daughter called Sofia Bella, is
 also believed to have donated millions of dollars to the church.

However, her relationship with Scientology
 began to falter after she allegedly asked as to the whereabouts of 
David Miscavige’s wife Shelly at the wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie 
Holmes in Italy in November 2006 – only to be told the question was out 
of line.

She also called 
the management ‘corrupt’ and is said to have made a break from the 
church after facing years of "interrogations" and "thought modification"
 for questioning leader David Miscavige's rule.

The
 star spoke out last night, saying:  ‘I wish to share my sincere and 
heartfelt appreciation for the overwhelming positive response I have 
received from the media, my colleagues, and fans from around the world. I
 am truly grateful and thankful for all your support.’

When asked about Shelley Miscaviage today, Leah admitted her aunt’s departure remains ‘as much a mystery to me as it is to everyone.’

Jenna, who this year released her tome on her troubling childhood, called 'Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape',

Leah would have had to under go 'auditing' - Scientology’s form of counseling,where a church member holds the sensors of the 
machine, which measures skin galvanism and is reflected in the motion of
 a needle indicator.

And Jenna said: ‘The confessional goes on for a long time, and as Leah probably realised, when you see that you didn’t do anything wrong, it becomes harder and harder to deal with it.’

Leah’s mother Vicki Marshall, is thought to remain an Operating Thetan Level Eight (the highest level of Scientology spiritual advancement) and Class Six Auditor, her stepfather, who is Operating Thetan Level Seven.

However her parents and sisters are standing by her and have promised not to let the family break apart.

However, Jenna says she is still banned from contacting the friends she grew up with, saying: ‘I have new friends now, and I still miss the people who I grew up with.'

Despite being back in contact with her parents, Jenna added: ‘There’s no messing around, you really do completely get cut off.’

‘I have my own family now though and it’s nice that I got out while I was still young enough.’
