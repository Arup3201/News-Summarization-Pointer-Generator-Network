The body of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died last week in Italy aged 100, should be sent to Germany and incinerated, the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre said in an interview.

Efraim Zuroff, who heads the Jewish 
Nazi-hunting organisation, told La Stampa daily's Monday edition that 
Germany had the 'best laws' to avoid the funeral becoming a neo-Nazi 
rally.

The former Nazi SS captain admitted shooting two 
people during the mass murder of 335 civilians in Italy during WWII but said he was only 
following orders. He has denied the Holocaust.

'The best thing would be to send the body back to Germany for it to be incinerated,' Zuroff said.

'That would be the most efficient way to leave no trace of a Nazi criminal like Priebke,' he said.

'Hitler's
 body was also burnt and that was the best solution because it allowed 
the destruction of everything Nazism represented,' he said.

Priebke's lawyer had initially said that the former SS officer could be buried in Argentina, where he lived after the Second World War. But Argentina said it would not accept his remains.

Rome religious authorities have also said there can be no church funeral for Priebke in the city.

After the war, Priebke escaped from a British POW camp and was supplied with Vatican travel documents by a Catholic bishop. He lived in Argentina as a free man, evading arrest for nearly 50 years.

He was finally extradited to Italy from Argentina in 1995 to face trial for the Fosse Ardeatine massacre of 335 civilians, and he was sentenced to life in prison. However he served that sentence under house arrest at the Rome home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini.

Giachini announced the death and released a final interview conducted with Priebke in July during which the German denied that Nazis gassed Jews during the Holocaust and accused the West of having fabricated the crimes to minimize the Allies' own abuses during the war.Â 

Priebke was tried and convicted for his 
role in the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians by Nazi forces at the 
Ardeatine Caves outside Rome.

A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase

The massacre was carried out in retaliation for an attack by resistance fighters that killed 33 members of a Nazi military police unit a day earlier.

Priebke admitted shooting two people and rounding up victims, but insisted he was only following orders.

He long felt like he had been scapegoated, since many other Germans who had participated in the massacre weren't convicted, another lawyer, Carlo Taormina, told The Associated Press.

'The dignity with which he withstood 
his persecution made him an example of courage, coherence and loyalty,' 
Giachini said in the statement.

The Fosse Ardeatine massacre was a mass execution carried out on 24 March 1944 by German occupation troops during the Second World War after an attack conducted the previous day in central Rome against the SS Police Regiment Bozen.

The massacre was perpetrated in what was then a little-frequented rural suburb of the city, inside the tunnels of the disused quarries of pozzolana, near the Via Ardeatina.

By mistake, 335 Italian prisoners were taken, five more than the 330 called for.

Led by SS officers Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, they were transported to the Ardeatine caves in truckloads and shot in groups of five.

Many of the German officers had never killed before, so Kappler ordered several cases of cognac to calm their nerves.

Many civilians were forced to kneel down over the bodies of those who had been killed before them.

During the day of killing, SS officers became drunk and there were reports of some victims' heads being blown off while others were not immediately killed.

One prisoner, a deserter from the Austrian army was allowed to live; the five surplus prisoners were murdered to prevent news of the location of the massacre.

One officer, who refused to shoot, was personally dragged to the execution site by Priebke, who forced him to kill his victim.

The officers then blew up the entrance to the caves to seal off the evidence.

The Ardeatine Caves site (Fosse Ardeatine), declared a Memorial Cemetery and National Monument, is open to visitors.

Priebke
 had escaped in 1946 from a British prison camp in Rimini, a resort town
 on Italy's Adriatic coast, and had lived in Argentina for nearly 50 
years before a U.S. television programme reported that he was living 
freely in the country.

That started a lengthy extradition process that ended with him boarding a plane in Argentina on Nov. 20, 1995, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials, to stand trial in Italy.

The country's highest appeals court upheld his conviction and life sentence in 1998. He was allowed to serve the term under house arrest due to his age, but was subsequently given small freedoms such as going to church and doing personal shopping - concessions that outraged Rome's Jewish community.

Mr Zuroff, the Simon Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi hunter who just this year launched a new push to search for unpunished war criminals, said Priebke's case proves it is never too late to seek justice.

'Priebke's death at the age of 100 should be a powerful reminder that some of the worst perpetrators of the crimes of the Holocaust live to a healthy old age and that a person's chronological age should never prevent them from being held accountable for their crimes, if they are healthy enough to be brought to justice,' he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem.

'Priebke was a classic example of a totally unrepentant Nazi war criminal.'

In his final interview, Priebke denied that gas chambers were used in Nazi concentration camps and that generations have been 'brainwashed' into believing that they were. He acknowledged he could be prosecuted for denying the Holocaust, but said such laws 'demonstrate fear of the truth coming out'.
