A 13-year-old girl has died after falling from a chairlift and plunging 20ft to the ground on a school skiing trip in the Alps.

Poonam Bhattal hit her head on a cement pylon as she fell shortly after getting on the lift in the Italian resort of Claviere yesterday morning.

It is thought the teenager may have had trouble getting on the lift, or slipped off before the protective bar was lowered.

Accident: The schoolgirl came off the ski-lift in the Italian resort of Claviere, which is in the Alps

The schoolgirl from the Guru Nanak 
Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, survived the fall and was airlifted 
off the mountain, but died on the way to a hospital in the nearby city 
of Susa, Italian officials said.

Poonam was on a week-long excursion 
with 30 other pupils and was due to return to her home in Langley, 
Slough, tomorrow. Her parents are now understood to be on their way to 
Italy.

A spokesman from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy confirmed the death and paid tribute to the student.

‘The leader of this trip and everyone
 associated with it is devastated by the death of an absolutely lovely 
student,’ the spokesman said.

‘The vice principal leading the trip 
has vast experience, having led 28 of such trips throughout his teaching
 career. He is obsessive about safety and security on these trips and is
 accompanied by two assistant head teachers and a massively experienced 
team of eight staff.’

A British consular official is en route from Milan to offer support and ‘try to ascertain what happened’.

A spokesman for Turin police added: 
‘We don’t know yet if she didn’t get on properly or if she fell because 
the barrier wasn’t down. She was taken to hospital but died on the way, 
presumably from a cardiac arrest.

‘Further investigations are in progress.’

The 13-year-old had been on a school trip with Guru Nanak Sikh Academy when she fell to her death

The trip was organised by holiday 
company Skibound. A spokesman said: ‘Skibound regrets to confirm that a 
pupil from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, has been 
involved in a fatal incident in the ski resort of Claviere.

‘The thoughts and condolences of all at Skibound are with the family, school and friends.’

Claviere is a small resort at an 
elevation of around 5,800ft on the border with France which is popular 
with families and beginners. It is 70 miles from Turin.

Poonam is the second British teenager
 to die in the Alps in less than a month. Lucy Sallis, 19, drowned in 
the French resort of Alpe d’Huez three weeks ago.

This week, nine-year-old Brook Hill 
was injured at Les Monts d’Olmes resort in the Pyrenees after a 
27-year-old skier mowed him down.

He fell into a coma and has had a section of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his brain.
