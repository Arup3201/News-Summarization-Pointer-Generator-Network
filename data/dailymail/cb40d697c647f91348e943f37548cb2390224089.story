Warning: Police constable Alex Denny (pictured) and his colleagues have put up posters around Worcester warning in both English and Polish that drinking in the streets is banned

Police battling to stop Eastern Europeans binge drinking in the street have put up posters in Polish warning them that alcohol is banned.

Officers in Worcester had the message translated to represent the 'multi-cultural' nature of the city, following complaints migrants were getting drunk in public.

The signs - which are written in both English and Polish - warn people that drinking in alcohol-free zones can result in an on-the-spot £60 fine.

West Mercia Police have found the city is home to a growing number of people from Eastern European countries, and there have been complaints of Polish men being among those seen drinking cans and bottles of alcohol in public.

Constable Alex Denny, who started putting up 30 of the plastic weather-proof signs today, said his colleagues often encountered Polish drinkers.

He added: 'There is a reasonable proportion of people we encounter in this locality who are Polish but all the signage we have is in English and they may not be aware they are drinking in an alcohol-free zone.

'The idea of this is to raise awareness to prevent people violating the conditions.

'Worcester is a multi-cultural city and there are people of a variety of nationalities living in the Lowesmoor area, which is a positive reflection on the city.

'A number of the drinkers we encounter are English males but there are also Polish males.

'What we are trying to do is make the legislation more easily understandable to the people we encounter.

'If we can educate people rather than reprimand them then that is something we would rather do.'

The black and yellow signs have been put up in areas across Worcester, which have been the subject of complaints by residents and businesses, so drinkers can’t plead for leniency and claim they could not read English warnings.

West Mercia Police say the signs are part of Operation Spartacus which has cut alcohol-related anti-social behaviour since it was launched last October.

Anyone caught drinking in the no-alcohol zones can face an on-the-spot £60 fine and have their alcohol seized.

They can also be served with a dispersal order, arrested or even given a criminal anti-social behaviour order.

There has been a strong Polish community presence in Worcester since the end of the Second World War when 1,200 Polish servicemen were demobilised from neighbouring Kidderminster to hostels around the area.
