EU bosses are to crack down on Google for failing to comply with privacy laws, France's data watchdog has said.

Google has been combining data from across its sites so it can improve they way it tailors its advertising to individuals since March.

However, regulators see the scheme as 'high risk' to people's privacy, and last October, the firm was given four months to revise its policy.

Google has been combining data from across its sites to better target adverts since March 2012. However, regulators see the scheme as 'high risk' to people's privacy - and say the firm has failed to implement its recommendations

Google's privacy policy—which allows the 
company to track users between services like Gmail and YouTube – has 
drawn fierce criticism from both US and European consumer advocacy 
groups.

The regulators included a 
list of 12 'practical recommendations' which would bring Google’s 
privacy policy and data collection up to standard.

They centre on the firm’s automatic collection of personal data, 
ranging from browsing histories and real-time location data to credit card 
details.

However, France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes (CNIL) data protection agency said the internet giant had not yet made the changes demanded by the regulators.

'At the end of a four-month delay accorded to Google to comply with 
the European data protection directive and to implement effectively 
(our) recommendations, no answer has been given,' it said in a statement.

CNIL, which led the probe on behalf of EU data-protection 
authorities, said EU regulators 'are determined to act and continue 
their investigations' and their 'repressive action.'

'Therefore, they propose to set up
 a working group, led by the CNIL, in order to coordinate their 
reaction, which should take place before summer.'

The new policy was implemented after Google combined 60 separate privacy policies into one agreement.

In October the data protection agencies warned Google its new confidentiality policy was not in line with EU laws, and gave the Internet giant four months to make changes or face legal action, including possible fines.

Privacy campaigners warned of 'real concern' over Google's lack of action.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'After a year of investigation it seems consumers are no closer to seeing any action taken against Google, despite regulators deeming its privacy policy to undermine their rights.

'It is of real concern that Google seems to be paying lip service to regulators and yet those same regulators have not taken meaningful action to resolve the situation.

'Ensuring consumers have control of their data and a clear understanding how it is used is a fundamental part of the digital economy.

'Google's actions seem to illustrate a company intent on frustrating both of these objectives.'

Google's data center in Douglas Country, Georgia. The firm has again come under fire for its privacy policies, with French regulators claiming the EU could take action within months

Google maintained in a statement released Monday that its confidentiality policy was not in breach of EU law.

'Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services,' Google said.

'We have engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process and we’ll continue to do so going forward.'

EU competition authorities are separately investigating whether Google has used its search engine to promote its own services and hinder competitors like Microsoft by manipulating search rankings.

Google has offered to change some of its business practices in response to that probe in order to avoid billions of dollars in potential fines.
