Britain's most jealous woman who forces her husband to take a lie detector test to check he is being faithful is now having a gastric band operation on the NHS to ensure he does not stray.

Debbi Wood, who weighs 21 stone, hit headlines last year after admitting that she forces her husband Steve to take the test whenever he goes out, in a bid to curb her extreme jealousy.

The 43-year-old, from Leicester, also checks his phone, e-mail accounts and bank statements and even bans him from watching TV shows featuring Holly Willoughby and Anne Robinson, who she suspects he fancies.

Controlling: Debbi Wood, 43, from Leicester, wants a gastric band operation paid for by the NHS so she can lose ten stone and reduce the risk of her husband Steve, 32, being unfaithful to her

Mrs Wood's jealousy is caused by Othello Syndrome, a psychiatric disorder which causes sufferers to believe their partners have been unfaithful, even without evidence. 

Now the size 24 mother-of-two wants the £2,500 taxpayer-funded operation so she can lose ten stone and be less anxious about her 32-year-old husband cheating.

Mrs Wood, who does not work, said she would have paid for the operation herself, but cannot afford to have the surgery privately.

She told The Sun: 'I think he will be less likely to run away with someone else if he has a slim and pretty wife at home.' 

Mr Wood, 32, is now a full-time carer for his wife, who is unable to work due to back pain associated with her weight. 

Together, the pair receive almost £1,500 per month in benefits, including income support, carer's allowance and disability and housing allowance.  

Mrs Wood said she cannot exercise because of her size but is 'really careful' about what she eats.

She said the pair occasionally 'treat themselves at the chippy' but that she has not had a McDonald's Big Mac for five years.

True love: The couple met in 2011 over Facebook and got married in November last year 

Yesterday, she posted on her Facebook page: 'All i got to say is mmm starbucks and burgerking, lol 2nd cheeseburger...in 5 years xx' 

Instead, Mrs Wood said she eats a healthy diet including chicken, fresh vegetables and fish and even bought a treadmill to try and lose some weight.

But she is still continuing to gain weight and, despite being a size 14 when the pair first met, is now a  size 24.

She said: 'I used to be thin - I had an attractive hourglass figure like Sophia Loren. I'd love to have my old body back.'

Mrs Wood has already had the tests to see if she is eligible for the operation and hopes to be fitted with the band later this year.

And she has already said that, if she does lose weight and find a new lease of life, she would be willing to take a lie detector test herself, to prove to her husband that she has not been unfaithful.

She said: 'I'm sure Steve is worried I'll slim down and leave him for someone else. Once I've slimmed down, if Steve wants me to take a lie detector test then I will.'

Meanwhile, Mr Wood said he is looking forward to his wife having the operation and hopes that, by fixing her physical issues, it will help her mental health problems.

The couple started dating in 2011 after they met through a friend. Mrs Wood had spent ten years living in the U.S. but moved back to Britain five years ago after another long-term relationship broke down.

She was so heartbroken that she vowed to never get into another relationship - and experts believe the emotional trauma triggered her illness.

Testing times: Mrs Wood has even said that she is happy to take a lie detector test if her husband begins to feel paranoid about cheating when she loses weight

She had said: 'I think he’s gorgeous, but that’s not the issue - it’s about whether or not I can trust him not to look at other women while he is out on his own,' she had said.

‘I don’t want him thinking they’re hot. If you’re in a relationship and you’re happy with your partner, you should only have eyes for that person.’ 

Mrs Wood was living in her native Scotland when a mutual friend introduced her to Mr Wood on Facebook a year later.

Suspicious: Othello, played here by actor Lenny Henry

Othello Syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little, if any, proof to confirm their fears.

The name is derived from Shakespeare’s Othello, who killed his wife Desdemona after suspecting her infidelity. 

The condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions.

In men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity, whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal.

Treatment includes antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and/or therapy.

It is not known how common the syndrome is but one study suggests the average onset is at age 68 and with 62 per cent of sufferers male.

After exchanging messages for several weeks, she travelled to London where the pair had their first date.

She said at the time: ‘I knew we were meant to be a couple when we shared our first kiss under London Bridge. I didn’t mean to fall in love again after my last relationship but Steve stole my heart.

‘The only problem was that we lived so far apart. We started to get serious and made plans to move in together but I then discovered that Steve had been seeing another girl around the time we’d first met.

‘He claimed he didn’t think we were exclusive because of the distance and I forgave him but I started to doubt whether or not he could be faithful.’

Mrs Wood, who also suffers from bipolar and body dysmorphic disorders, added that her jealousy got worse when the pair moved in together as she tried to monitor Mr Wood’s every move.

She installed child-proof filters on his laptop and mobile phone to stop him looking at explicit pictures of women and banned him from watching any television programmes featuring women, even programmes such as The Weakest Link.

‘One night, an advert for a women’s razor came on television and I felt panicky thinking that Steve was eyeing the model up,' she said.

'The only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them.

‘Now, I won’t even let him watch The Weakest Link in case he fancies Anne Robinson but I’m scared he’ll have a sneaky look when I’m in another room.

‘That’s why I decided to order the lie detector online. It was my only way of knowing for sure if Steve’s eyes were wandering. In general, he’s quite truthful but I have caught him lying a few times about looking at other women.’

Mrs Wood was diagnosed with Othello Syndrome last September, with the condition affecting her so badly that she could barely leave the house.

She was prescribed anti-anxiety medication and also underwent therapy to deal with her issues.

The name of the condition is derived from the play by William Shakespeare, in which the character of Othello murders his wife Desdemona after suspecting infidelity.
