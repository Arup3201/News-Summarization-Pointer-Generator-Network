Prince Harry made a ‘mistake’ in saying he had killed Taliban fighters, Afghan president Hamid Karzai said yesterday.

Speaking ahead of talks with David Cameron at Chequers, Mr Karzai declined to comment in detail about the Prince’s controversial claims, but said: ‘He’s a young man, and young men do make mistakes talking.’

Mr Karzai also provocatively claimed that life in Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand province was better, and safer, before British troops arrived in 2006.

The three men agreed that peace talks to secure the future of Afghanistan had to involve the Taliban

Prince Harry, 28, spoke last month about his 20-week posting as an Apache helicopter gunner in Afghanistan.

‘Take a life to save a life, that’s 
what we revolve around,’ he said. ‘If there’s people trying to do bad 
stuff to our guys, then we’ll take them out of the game.’

His comments caused controversy here 
and angered some in Afghanistan.

Mr Karzai, a friend of Prince Charles, 
yesterday made clear his disapproval, but stressed the matter should go 
no further.

The three leaders said that ¿significant progress¿ had been made since they last met in September

The trilateral meeting, held at the Prime Minister's official country retreat, was the third such meeting in less than a year

He said: ‘Prince Harry is a young man, we do give exits to young men when they make mistakes.’

Mr Karzai described the growing spate 
of insider attacks on Western forces by members of Afghanistan’s 
security forces as a ‘serious breach of hospitality’.

He insisted that Helmand province was better off before British troops arrived in 2006.

Prince Harry talked about 'taking out' Taliban insurgents during his tour of duty in Afghanistan

‘In 2002 through to 2006, Afghanistan 
had a lot better security.

When we had our own presence there, with very
 little foreign troops, schools were open in Helmand and life was more 
secure.’

But he insisted he did not want to 
‘blame’ Britain for making the situation worst – and insisted that 
Afghans ‘appreciate the sacrifices of the British forces’.

Mr Karzai 
said it was unclear whether Britain and the US, which will withdraw 
combat troops next year, were leaving because they thought they had 
achieved their mission in weakening Al Qaeda or because they had 
realised they were ‘fighting in the wrong place in the first place, so 
they should discontinue doing that and leave’.

His comments are likely to cause 
controversy in the UK, which has spent more than £17billion on the 
Afghan conflict and lost 440 soldiers. Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former 
Army officer, said: ‘This message will hit the many bereaved families in
 this country very hard. I hope that President Karzai is sincere when he
 says he appreciated the sacrifice our young men and women have made.’

President Karzai’s comments came ahead
 of talks at Chequers with Mr Cameron and Pakistan’s president Asif Ali 
Zardari on the future of Afghanistan.

Mr Cameron is trying to broker a 
security deal between the two countries to be in place before Western 
combat troops leave Afghanistan in 2014. Islamist extremists are 
threatening both countries.

He urged them to encourage moderate elements of the Taliban to join peace talks.

Mr Zardari (left) peace in Pakistan depended on peace in Afghanistan, adding: 'We feel that we can only survive together'

Mr Cameron said the three countries agreed that Afghanistan must never  become a 'haven for terrorism'

The summit included senior political, military and intelligence figures from the three countries, including Mr Cameron, Mr Karzai, British Foreign Secretary William Hague, national security advisor Kim Darroch, the UK Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers

The leaders called on the Taliban to open an office and to enter into dialogue to secure long-term peace in Afghanistan

Further talks are expected to take place later this year, as British and US troops prepare to leave Afghanistan
