The BBC bill for first and business class flights soared by more than 40 per cent to £1.3million last year, despite its pledges to cut costs.

Staff spent more than £3,500 a day on the most expensive fares as they jetted around the world in luxury.

The BBC promised a new era of cost-cutting, but has admitted paying £1,278,618 for 950 business and first class tickets in 2013/4 – 46 per cent up on the previous year.

Big spenders: The BBC spent almost £1.3million on 950 flights last year and refused to reveal details of 9,000 more

But the figures, revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, include only flights bought using the corporation’s central booking system.

The BBC refused to give details of the 
9,000 flights booked in the last two years via external travel agents, 
used for major sporting events.

Tony Hall vowed to find cost savings of £100million a year when he joined the Corporation last year

Under BBC guidelines, employees are told to use the lowest cost means of transport and use video conferences instead of face-to-face meetings where possible.

Travelling any class other than economy is allowed only under ‘exceptional circumstances’ for journeys over four hours and where it saves money on baggage.

When director-general Tony Hall was appointed last year, he said the BBC would have to find further cost savings of £100million a year.

He has warned ‘tough choices lie ahead’ in the run-up to the renewal of its royal charter at the end of 2016.

But last night the BBC was accused of being frivolous with licence fee payers’ cash.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘This only reinforces what the vast majority of people know – the BBC are out of touch.’

Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s outrageous that BBC employees, paid for by the licence fee, are racking up huge bills living the high life at our expense.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Some element of travel is inevitable if the BBC is to cover global news events and deliver programmes from around the world.

'An upgraded flight with additional baggage capacity for bulky camera equipment can often cost less than a standard fare with excess baggage charges.’
