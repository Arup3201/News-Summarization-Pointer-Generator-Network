An actor who once portrayed McGruff the Crime Dog has been sniffed out by a bona fide crime-fighting fido - and sentenced to over 16 years prison because of it.

John R. Morales, 41, of Houston, was sentenced on drug and weapons charges this after police found more than 1,000 marijuana plants and 27 weapons, including grenade launchers, at two indoor farms.

Morales wore the McGruff costume for the Harris County Sheriff's Association in the late 1990s, playing the famous 'Take a bite out of crime' dog.

But he was arrested in 2011 when a proper police dog detected pot plants in Morales' trunk after he was stopped for speeding in Galveston, according to CBS Local.

A raid produced the arsenal of weapons and a multitude of marijuana.

Defense attorney Ken Fesler II says Morales entered the drug trade to help sick relatives.

On Monday, the former actor pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

Morales insisted that he was nonviolent, but U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore stated that: 'Everything I read about you makes you seem like a scary person.'
