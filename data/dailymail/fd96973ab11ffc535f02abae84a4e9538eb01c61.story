What a carry on: Vicki Allen lifts her beaming daughter Lilee as she trudges through the mud

The grown-ups had to grin and bear it. The children, however, just grinned and enjoyed the mud and rain that swamped the Isle of Wight festival over the weekend.

Rain clouds may have left 55,000 music fans’ tents awash, but they brought a silver lining to youngsters who pulled on their wellies and had fun.

It was the only thing to do in a June which forecasters say could end up being one of the wettest for 100 years. Although the heavy rain is set to settle down this week there is still no sign of sustained summer weather.

After washing away much of the Jubilee spirit during the Queen’s celebrations earlier this month, the weather did its worst to the Isle of Wight festival. It had begun on Friday amid chaos, and when campers woke up yesterday morning it was to a sea of mud.

Anyone planning to cut and run early before the festival’s scheduled end this morning certainly faced a struggle if they had a car with them. In some cases Land Rovers pulling cars required another four-wheel-drive vehicle to drag them both free of the quagmire.

Extra police were due to be on duty from last night to help the getaway and avoid a repeat of Friday’s problems, when those arriving amid the mud and rain ended up in such huge traffic jams that ferry services from the mainland had to be suspended.

Festival organiser John Giddings apologised but proclaimed the event, whose acts included Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen, a success.

He said: ‘We knew it was going to happen. We were prepared. We knew there would be adverse weather conditions – it was just slow and we caused a great traffic jam and I am sorry to all those who got stuck in it.

‘I hope that I have made up for it by providing one of the best weekends of music ever.

‘There is something about adverse conditions that makes people enjoy themselves. There’s something about British people – they are going to have a good time whatever and I love them for it.’

He said 100 four-wheel-drive vehicles would be on hand to help drag the vehicles of those leaving out of the mud in the car parks.

Matt Dobson, senior forecaster at the Meteo-Group weather centre, said: ‘This is one of the wettest Junes since 2007, which was exceptional. It could be one of the wettest Junes of the last 100 years.’

On the plus side, Britain is set for a few drier days with temperatures approaching the June average.

But Met Office forecaster Rebecca Sherwin said things looked like remaining unsettled ‘for the next couple of weeks’.

The
festival was affected by a deluge which saw gridlocked drivers forced 
to sleep in their cars as the car parks at Seaclose Park, Newport, had 
become flooded and inaccessible with mud.

The queues caused ferry companies to 
suspend their services and about 600 people were stranded on ferries on 
the Solent as the cars could not disembark because of backed-up traffic 
on the island.

But 
after emergency car parks were opened off-site on Friday the backlog was
cleared and sunshine even broke through for the rest of the day.

Police have warned festival-goers and local residents to expect delays after the event finishes.

The
traffic plan being put into place will control traffic leaving the site
during today's rush hour to enable commuters to reach their workplace 
and schools as freely as possible.

Transport
operators have already reported an increased flow in people leaving the
festival early to avoid the expected slow exit.

Ferry companies Wightlink and Red Funnel are both operating extra sailings to help people leave the island more easily.

Stuart Love, Isle of Wight Council 
director of economy and the environment, said: 'This is a constantly 
evolving situation but I can assure residents and festival-goers that 
all agencies are working together to implement arrangements designed to 
keep disruption to minimum.

'Regulating
movement from the car parks should mean that the situation today and 
Monday will be very different to that on Thursday and Friday when the 
congestion was unacceptable.'

Chief Inspector Nick Heelan, of 
Hampshire and Isle of Wight police, said: 'Getting people home safely 
and returning the local roads and community to normality as quickly as 
we can is our priority.

'We have extra officers drafted in from the mainland today to work with marshals to keep traffic moving.

'We
are working very closely with the organisers, the council and other 
agencies to minimise disruption, and have every resource available doing
everything possible to keep people safe and moving.'

Householders and businesses in Cumbria, Lancashire and West Yorkshire were clearing up yesterday after widespread flooding.

At Keswick in Cumbria, where up to an inch of rain fell on Saturday night, a campsite warden took to a canoe to examine a caravan left deep in flood water.

In West Yorkshire the River Calder reached record levels and Hebden Bridge town centre was inundated. Mytholmroyd was also badly affected.

At Croston in Lancashire the Yarrow burst its banks and 70 homes were evacuated.

At one point, 23 flood warnings and 65 ‘alerts’ – many of them in the South-West – were in place.

Forecaster Matt Dobson, of MeteoGroup, said: ‘There could well be more flash-flooding later in the week, though it doesn’t look as bad as it has been.’
