When buying clothes for an eight-year-old boy, the priority for most parents would be that they can be shoved in the washing machine when he comes home covered in mud.

Vicky Antonia, however, begs to differ. The 31-year-old model has spent more than £20,000 on her son’s wardrobe since he was born – and it’s all designer.

Miss Antonia dresses Zak, her only child, exclusively in clothes from brands such as Armani, D&G, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Gucci and Prada, spending up to £1,000 a month.

When he was a baby she bought him  a 
£100 Christian Dior bottle, and since then she has spent £10,000 on 
jeans and  T-shirts, £5,000 on 200 pairs of shoes and £5,000 on 
accessories. Even his swimming trunks are Armani.

Miss Antonia, from Epping, Essex, 
said she had funded her son’s expensive wardrobe with money from his 
father, a businessman from whom she is separated.

He was on what she described as 
‘footballer’s wages’ at the time. She explained: ‘I wanted to give Zak 
the things I wouldn’t have been able to give him myself and the things 
that I didn’t have growing up.

‘I know it must sound like I am 
spoiling him, but I just want him to look his best. What is wrong with 
making your son look good?

'When Zak was first born I was really
young and I didn’t know any better, so I just bought him stuff without 
really thinking about anything.

‘Because he is so young I don’t think he even understands the fact that he has all this designer gear.’
Miss Antonia added: ‘I would buy him different sizes in the same shoe if
I really liked them so that when he grew out of one pair he could just 
put on the newer ones.’

She admitted that she sometimes 
regrets spending so much, adding: ‘I could have put that money away for 
his future, but I was given money from his father at the time and I just
used to spend it week on week. I just thought it would always be like 
that.’

Zak was born prematurely and spent two months in intensive care with bacterial meningitis.

After that, Miss Antonia vowed to give her ‘miracle baby’ whatever he wanted.

She said: ‘As far as I’m concerned he
is my wonder child and I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing to 
want to treat your son.’
