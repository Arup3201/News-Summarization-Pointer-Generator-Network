Sandro is having a medical at QPR ahead of a £10million move to Loftus Road. 

You can usually count on Harry Redknapp to make his mark on deadline day, and it looks like the QPR manager has done it again by going back to his old club to pull off an audacious move for the Tottenham midfielder.  

Redknapp knows the 25-year-old well from his time as manager of Tottenham and is keen to nab Sandro, who seems out-of-favour with Mauricio Pochettino.

Backed: Harry Redknapp wants to bring out-of-favour Tottenham defensive midfielder Sandro to QPR

Sandro Raniere Guimares Cordeiro, to give him his full name, was signed by Tottenham in 2009. Their manager was Harry Redknapp - who is trying to buy the 25-year-old Brazil midfielder at QPR.

'Sandro I think is having a medical, so that is great,' he told Sky Sports News.

'Sandro looks like we have agreed everything with Tottenham. I signed him and I love him, he was a fantastic player for me.'

Sandro was absent from the Tottenham squad that lost 3-0 against Liverpool at White Hart Lane, but Levy originally wanted double the original £8m fee that Redknapp paid in 2010.

QPR owner Tony Fernandes is prepared to back his manager but wants Shaun Wright-Phillips and other dead wood to be shifted from Loftus Road.

Jermain Defoe remains on Redknapp's shortlist and MLS club Toronto are prepared to let him leave. 

Leicester City are the latest club to express an interest in Defoe, who has also been linked with Newcastle United.
