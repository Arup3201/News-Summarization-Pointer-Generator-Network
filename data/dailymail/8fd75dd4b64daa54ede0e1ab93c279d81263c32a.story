Harry Kane enjoyed an unforgettable start to what could be a memorable 2015 for the Tottenham striker.

The 21-year-old has quickly established himself as a fans' favourite at his boyhood club, where he further endeared himself with a match-winning display on New Year's Day.

Kane scored twice and provided a further two assists as Spurs annihilated London rivals Chelsea 5-3, producing a complete performance which makes an international call-up seem par for the course.

It was talk the England Under 21s forward downplayed afterwards, preferring to focus on what was a match those connected to Spurs will not forget in a hurry.

'The fans were brilliant,' Kane said. 'They'll be buzzing going into the new year after beating one of their London rivals, who we have struggled against in recent years.

'I am delighted for the fans and delighted for the club as well. Hopefully we will take this into the games ahead.'

Few could have predicted the manner of Tottenham's win, especially when Diego Costa put the league leaders ahead after 18 minutes.

At that point it looked like Spurs would suffer yet another bad result against Chelsea, only for Kane to draw level in superb style - a 25-yard strike he called his best goal to date given 'the moment and the situation we were in'.

'I am delighted to score against one of the best teams in the world,' Kane, whose side take on Burnley in the FA Cup on Monday, told Spurs TV.

'To get us back in the game and win the way we did is obviously a great night for us.

'We stayed in the game after they scored and whenever I get the ball on the edge of the box I always look to shoot. 

'Thankfully it went in and then we really pushed on, built a bit of momentum.

'We finished the game and obviously got five goals against a really good defence.'
