 

A mentally disabled Connecticut high school student has been charged with sexually assaulting a disabled fellow student in a school bathroom as classmates cheered him on, according to police and court documents.

Patrick Nolan, 19, was arraigned on Wednesday in Bridgeport Superior Court and charged with felony sexual assault and risk of injury to a child for the August 2013 attack on a male 16-year-old classmate at Harding High School, police said.

An attorney for Nolan, Mark Phillips, said his client is 'profoundly retarded' and the unnamed classmates and teacher's aides who should have been supervising his client are to blame.

HORROR:  A 'profoundly retarded' high school student has been charged with sexually assaulting a disabled male student in a bathroom as classmates cheered him on. Patrick Nolan, 19, was charged with felony sexual assault and risk of injury to a child for the August 2013 attack at Harding High School, pictured. An attorney for Nolan claims the unidentified group who instigated and egged on the attack are to blame and Nolan is a victim

An affidavit filed in the case painted a horrific scene of the incident drawn from details from a school surveillance video outside the bathroom and a student recording of the attack.

In the videos, a student shouts 'keep going' while the victim is being sexually assaulted from behind, and afterward students are huddled together seemingly watching the cell phone recording, court documents stated.

The footage also showed a group of students clapping after the victim passes in front of the camera, according to the affidavit.

'(He) was having fun with my butt, asked me to pull my pants down and tries putting his private area into my butt. He pulls his pants down and starts like getting all nasty and everything. ... He was taking me from behind,' the victim said to detectives in an interview.

Nolan's attorney, Mark Phillips, said the students who filmed the incident were instigators and were not disabled themselves.

'This was not some sociopath going into a high school at the age of 19 and raping a special needs kid,' Phillips said.  

'This is something where able-minded students took advantage of these special education students.' 

The students have not been identified and the school officials claim they do not know who they are. 

The attack happened on the second day of school last year. The incident was investigated after the victim's mother made a complaint.

'This boy (Nolan) is profoundly retarded, and this is lost on the depiction of the situation,' Phillips told the Connecticut Post. 

'Able-minded students got these two special-education students into the bathroom and then egged them on into a situation and filmed it. They are the criminals.'

According to the Post, special needs students are not allowed to go the bathroom unaccompanied. 

'An aide or teacher allowed special-needs kids to go to the bathroom by themselves, which is against school policy,' Phillips told the Post.

Nolan was released by the court and ordered to return for a plea entry hearing on July 15.

The Bridgeport Public School District declined comment on Thursday. 

A spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Child and Families said the agency was barred by state law from providing additional information on the case.
