Jimmy Bullard almost became the third person to leave the 'I'm A Celebrity' jungle when a freak storm reportedly left him suffering from a panic attack.

Whilst taking part in the show's 'Shed of Dread' Bush Tucker Trial alongside fellow former sportsman Carl Fogarty, the two found themselves cut off from the rest of camp when the storm hit.

'Jimmy was talking about leaving the show,' a source told the Daily Star, 'He said he felt unsafe.'

To make matters worse, the torrential rain prevented the security team from reaching the duo by washing away all connecting roads.

Bullard and Foggy were eventually saved from their bug-infested jail when qualified staff fought their way to them, according to the Daily Star.

A favourite to win the show, Bullard reportedly suffered a panic attack when he rejoined the camp upon his rescue.

The weather conditions were so adverse that producers were forced to put a stop to the tasks - including another involving Nadia Forde and Tinchy Stryder - due to safety concerns.

In an act of kindness the show's bosses gave the celebrities their full ten meals in the hopes to keep them positive.

With Gemma Collins leaving after three days and Craig Charles travelling home following the tragic death of his brother, producers did their best to reassure Bullard the storm was a one off.

According to reports it would appear they have done the trick... for now at least. 

Producers of the show managed to convince the former Wigan and Fulham midfielder to stay in the jungle
