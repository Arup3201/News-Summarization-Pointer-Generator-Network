A disabled pensioner claims is facing a parking bill of up to £1,500 because he displayed his blue badge upside down.

John O’Callaghan, 66, had parked his Ford Focus on a street while he visited a friend at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, returning to find an £80 ticket because his disability badge was not correctly displayed.

As he did not have enough money to pay the fine, a bailiff company acting on behalf of the city's council is demanding he pay £422 - or risk having his possessions confiscated.

Pensioner: John O’Callaghan, 66, claims he is facing a parking bill of up to £1,500 because he displayed his blue badge upside down while parked on a street in Liverpool

The retired factory worker, from Speke claims he has been told the final bill could rise to £1,500 if he does not pay.

Mr O’Callaghan, who suffers from a heart condition and uses a walking stick, said: 'They are threatening to come round to my flat and clamp my car.

'I parked and left my badge the wrong way up, it was an honest mistake.

'I told them I couldn’t pay £80 in one go so asked if I could do it over two months but the council wanted it straight away.

'Now I’ve had a letter saying it’s gone up to £422 or they will send the bailiffs round. I think these are bully-boy tactics.

'And they are threatening it could go up to £1,500.

'The stress of all this has been really bad for my health - I’m not a well man, I’ve got a heart condition.'

He added: 'They want me to pay an absolute fortune and it’s frightening the living daylights out of me.'

Liverpool council has defended its position and says there will always be 'additional charges' when bailiffs are called in.

A spokesman said: 'Before bailiffs get involved there are opportunities to appeal against the notice, several reminder letters are sent out and we would ask people not to ignore these letters.

'If anybody has difficulty in paying the penalty charge notice, they should contact us to make arrangements about paying.

'We also require a county court order before the matter is sent to the bailiffs and there would have been further opportunities for people to state their case.

'If bailiffs do become involved there will be additional charges so it is important that they get in touch with us at an early stage.'
