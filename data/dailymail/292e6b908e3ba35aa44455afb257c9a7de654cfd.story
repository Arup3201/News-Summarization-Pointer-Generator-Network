Ryan Giggs tried to steer David Moyes away from the rocks even as the Manchester United manager’s doomed reign entered its final throes.

Giggs, United's interim boss following Moyes's sacking on Tuesday, became an increasingly peripheral figure in the Scot's backroom team and felt that his promotion to player-coach last summer was little more than a PR exercise to please supporters.  

But it did not stop the Old Trafford veteran making a personal plea to his former manager to show leniency to Ashley Young, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley after they were photographed partying into the early hours in Manchester following United’s Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich.

Moyes punished his three England internationals with a fine and ordered them to do extra training at Carrington last week.  

Giggs agreed that his team-mates were unwise to be out on the town so soon after high-profile defeat, but argued that they had not broken any specific rules.

He also suggested that Moyes would not have taken such a hardline stance with some of the more senior members of his squad. 

Giggs knew 
that the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the United 
players, not just the three who were punished, and tried to convince 
Moyes that it was the wrong thing to do. His plea went unheeded although
 it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now he has been put in 
temporary charge. 

The
 issue was indicative of the way in which Moyes lost the support of his 
squad over time. It was significant that the Scot did not mention them 
in a statement on Wednesday, and there has been a notable silence from 
the players on social media since he left the club.
