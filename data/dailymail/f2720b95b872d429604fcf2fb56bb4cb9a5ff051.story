Search: Detectives say they will be making 'substantial' efforts in their hunt to find missing Madeleine McCann over the coming weeks

Detectives looking for Madeleine McCann will begin 'substantial' work on their investigation in Portugal within weeks.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police are working with Portuguese police during a fresh phase of their hunt for the missing girl, who disappeared aged three on a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz.

Mark Rowley, the assistant commissioner of the force, said: 'In the forthcoming weeks we are going to be going to a substantial phase of operational activity on the ground in Portugal.

'A thorough serious crime investigation 
works systematically through all the credible possibilities, and often 
in an investigation you will have more than one credible possibility'.

However, he warned that they may not come up with answers quickly - or at all.

The announcement came weeks after detectives were spotted using a helicopter to take aerial photos in the holiday resort where Madeleine disappeared after being left in her room by parents Gerry and Kate McCann.

Police were then preparing to excavate three areas in the resort in the hope of turning up clues. Though they were not given permission to conduct the dig themselves, experts were on hand to oversee the work - including those trained to detect bodies.

British police officers have been negotiating with their Portuguese counterparts throughout the search.

It is thought they have requested permission to question eight crucial witnesses in their investigation. However other requests - including plans to raid homes of prime suspects - were refused.

Mr Rowley said: 'I want to be able to go back to Kate and Gerry at some stage in the future and tell them we’ve got to the bottom of this, or second best is to go back to them and say we’ve turned over every stone and we can’t get to an answer sometimes'.

A number of officers from Scotland Yard are hoping to be involved in the latest phase of activity, though it is being led by the Portuguese.

Mr and Mrs McCann have been briefed on the activity, but will not travel to Portugal while the work is being carried out.

'The activity in Portugal is led by the Portuguese, that’s absolutely crystal clear in law,' Mr Rowley said.

'We have some officers who would like to be helping with that on the ground in Portugal, doing some of the work we anticipate. We are putting the finishing touches to the plans to the Portuguese in the coming weeks'.

He added: 'I anticipate a substantial phase of activity in forthcoming weeks including Portuguese and British officers but the detail of that is still being finalised with Portuguese colleagues and it will all be under Portuguese leadership.'

Hunt: Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed

One line of inquiry for Scotland Yard is a lone male paedophile who staged a series of sex attacks on young British girls while they were on holiday in the Algarve.

They are looking at nine sexual assaults and three 'near misses' on British girls aged six to 12 between 2004 and 2006, including one in 2005 on a 10-year-old girl in Praia da Luz, where Madeleine vanished two years later.

Hundreds of people have already made contact with police in response to appeals to try to find the attacker.

Mr Rowley warned that, after sifting through all the possible lines of inquiry, officers may draw a blank.

'There’s lots of potential lines of inquiry', he said. 'If we didn’t think there were any potentially fruitful lines of inquiry, we wouldn’t be where we are today; we would be saying there’s nowhere to go with this investigation.

'There are many potential fruitful lines of inquiry and the only way you get anywhere is to work through them all systematically.

'Within that may be the answer and the case may be potentially solvable. We may be able to work through potential lines of inquiry over a period of time with the Portuguese and all of them draw a blank, that can happen'.
