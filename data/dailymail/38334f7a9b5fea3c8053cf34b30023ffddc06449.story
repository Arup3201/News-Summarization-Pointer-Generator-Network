They may not be the usual tourist sports but for one urban explorer these abandoned buildings are the ideal holiday destinations.

Photographer Dan Marbaix has travelled around the world to take pictures of the beautiful buildings that have been largely forgotten. 

However, his hobby is a dangerous one and he has been arrested 20 times for trespass in just five years.

Abandoned: Urban explorer Dan Marbaix has travelled around the world taking pictures of unusual derelict buildings such as this decaying doctor's house in Germany

Stunning: The Chambre du Commerce in Belgium is a huge draw for urban explorers. The building, in Antwep, was erected in 1872 as a reconstruction of a 1531 Stock Exchange. It ceased being used in 2003 after failing to meet fire safety regulations and lay abandoned for seven years until a series of renovation plans were put forward. A private investor wants to turn the building into shops, a grand cafe, restaurants and a luxirous hotel. Renovation work on the outside of the building has begun.

Hidden gems: The photographer often has to squeeze through windows and gaps in buildings or climb up walls to get in to abandoned rooms like this Belgian theatre

Left in a hurry? Hundreds of books have been left on the shelves in this but abandoned UK manor house but the wallpaper is ripped and the ceiling has partly collapsed

Industrial: The original Abbey Mills Pumping Station in East London was built in 1868. Now replaced by a modern sewage pumping station, Abbey Mills is used as a film location and represented Arkham Asylum in Batman Begins

Mr Marbaix has gained unique access to some of the rarest places in the world and uses any method he can to do so.The 33-year-old photographer creeps, 
ducks, climbs, scrambles and squeezes his way into abandoned sites and 
buildings to get unparalleled holiday experiences - even having to 
sidestep security at times.

But for all the times he’s been arrested or given a stern telling off from police, he insists it’s all worth it.

Mr Marbaix, of London, said: 'I’ve seen sneaking around places I shouldn’t have been in since I was a teenager but have been more focussed in the past five years.

Place of worship: Two religious statues - in almost perfect condition - still stand in this abandoned Belgian monastery

Former glory: The National Gas Turbine Establishment in Hampshire, known simply as Pyestock, was once an iconic site of British engineering but has been neglected since its closure in 2000. It is now scheduled for demolition but, in its heyday after the Second World War, it was at the forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research

Eerie: Mr Marbaix said despite the creepiness of buildings like the Masonic Boys School, in the UK (left), and a city hall in Germany (right), he is not interested in 'ghouls'

Dangerous hobby: The photographer said he has previously been held at gunpoint by Italian police after trespassing to take pictures of abandoned buildings like this villa in Italy

School's out forever: This beautiful building was once filled with British schoolchildren but is now slowly decaying

'I enjoy seeing what most people don’t
 get to see when they go abroad and the buzz of getting into the 
buildings. I used to work in the city so the peace and quiet of an 
abandoned building and the lack of people getting in my photos were also
 things I enjoyed about it.

'I started to meet people who did the same thing and before you know it you’re going most weekends.'

The photographer jumps in his car with a basic idea of where he’s heading and off he goes.

He has travelled through Italy, Germany, Austria, Holland and America enjoying his passion for urban exploring.

Mysterious: Little is known about the ornate Chateau Lumiere in France but it is regularly visited by urban explorers fascinated by its decaying splendour

Left behind: This vintage Singer sewing machine has been left in the chateau with a cotton reel still attached to the top

All that remains: Objects like the stuffed pheasant at a Belgian villa (left) and the shoes left in front of the burner at a hunting lodge (right), give clues to the former owners

Macarbe: The green bed screens are still pulled across in this abanonded ward in West Park Mental Hospital in Epsom, Surrey. Built in 1923, the hospital was slowly run down from the mid-1990s and most of the buildings closed in 2003

Untouched: ECVB power station in Ghent, Belgium, was hugely popular with urban explorers wanting to capture on film the huge rusting machinery but it is now being pulled down by the authorities

Despite the unbeatable views, Mr Marbaix insists the biggest adrenaline rush is avoiding getting caught.

He
 said: 'I rarely get spooked when I visit rotting and neglected places -
 I’m not really into the ghouls and ghost side of it - but you do get an
 increase in heart rate when hiding from security and they get within 
metres of you.

'In the UK there's not a great deal police can do as long as you don’t break in or steal anything as trespassing is a civil offence.

Once a home: The ornate twin beds at this Belgian chateau are still intact but the wallpaper has peeled and the floor is covered in rubble

Beautiful: Sammazzano Castle, in Tuscany, Italy, (left) is one of the most spectacular captured by the photographer. It is commonly known as Non Plus Ultra - meaning 'nothing further beyond' - because the words are decorated inside. Built in 1605, it is filled with dazzling Moorish designs and mosaics. It's ornate designs are in contrast to the stark, giant walls of this Belgian cooling tower (right)

Creepy: This atmospheric picture of a derelict Belgian hunting lodge looks like it could have come straight out of a horror film

Holy site: The stunning mural can be seen on the far wall of this Belgian church but it seems to have been abandoned by its congregation

'But in the U.S. it’s illegal to 
trespass so the stakes are a little higher and if you do get caught it 
all depends on the country and the mood the police are in.

'It’s
 ranged from a chat and being allowed around the building to lying on 
the floor as a policeman holds a submachine gun and shouts angrily in 
Italian.

'Generally always just ends in a bit of a telling off.'

Glorious: This dome sits on top of the former Beelitz-Heilstätten sanitorium in Germany, where Hitler recuperated after his World War One injury. From 1945 to 1995 it was used as a Red Army hospital but attempts to privatise it after the Soviet withdrawal were not wholly successful. While some buildings are still in use, the surgery, psychiatric ward and rife range were all abandoned

Glimpse into the past: Lights and a table still covered with a white sheet remain at this UK hospital (left) and candlesticks and glass vases and mirrors have just been left in this Belgian chateau

Industrial beauty: No one has ever removed this blast furnace in Belgium, which remains standing in almost the same condition as when it was used

Frozen in time: Some abandoned buildings such as Hospital Diablo in France has fallen foul of metal thieves and vandals
