Inventor Kenneth Reiner's ideas for his Los Angeles mansion may have been massive - but unfortunately his wallet wasn't big enough to match them.

The stunning, futuristic home, which has since featured in movies and music videos, has gone on the market for $7.5 million - five decades after it helped bankrupt Reiner.

The industrialist, who made a small fortune designing self-locking aircraft nuts and women's hair grips in the mid-20th century, set no budget for the 4,720 sq ft property, known as 'Silvertop'.

But while he anticipated it would cost him around $75,000 to build, the actual total topped $1 million.

Stunning: 'Silvertop' was built between 1957 and 1976 and is now on the market for $7.5 million

Futuristic: In 1960, the Evening Post called it 'the darnedest house ever seen around Southern California'

Picturesque: The mansion, which overlooks the Silver Lake Reservoir, had the first ever infinity pool

Breathtaking: The pool was the work of original owner, inventor Kenneth Reiner, and designer John LautnerÂ 

Today, 
beneath its curved roof, sit three bedrooms, four bathrooms, a library, 
study, carport and darkroom, as well as a guest house, tennis court, 
gardens and the first-ever infinity pool.

Patios and gardens give views over the San Gabriel Mountains, Silver Lake, Downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign in the Santa Monica Mountains and West to the Ocean, according to the listing with Crosby Doe Associates.

Reiner also called for gadgets straight out of a Bond movie, including a dining table with a hydraulic pedestal that was lowered for cocktails and elevated for meals, his L.A. Times obituary said.

Among other gadgets and quirky designs - invented by Reiner or architect John Lautner - was a cantilevered driveway that the city feared would not safely hold a car.

Interior: The 4,720 square foot home has three bedrooms and four bathrooms amid a sleek design

Futuristic: In the 50s, Reiner asked for designs including hidden buttons in the wall and moving furniture

Smart: Reiner placed no budget on his designs, including these walls that open to reveal the view

Simple: After Reiner hit money troubles it sat empty for years until new owners bought it in 1974

Spacious: The guest house has an open plan living and dining area, as well as one bedroom and bathroom

Light: In 1974, a new family took over the property and worked with the same designer to finish it

Publications at the time also expressed awe at the swimming pool, which was 'spookily engineered so there seems to be no rim, just water to the edge,' according to Life magazine in 1962.

In 1960, the Saturday Evening Post called Silvertop 'the darnedest house ever seen around Southern California', Yahoo! Homes reported.

Despite the money he poured in to the structure, Reiner and his family never got to live in it.

'In the end... the extravagance of Silvertop was Reiner's undoing,' his obituary read.

He had hoped to spend $75,000 on it, but he didn't put any limitations on Lautner and costs soared.

Reiner and a business partner formed a corporation to support Lautner's office so he could work full time on the house - but the partner eventually sued Reiner, and he lost the home in bankruptcy.

'I thought
 he would be devastated,' Guy Zebert, the original project architect, 
told the L.A. Times. 'But he didn't show it too much. He just kept on 
moving.'

Afterwards, Reiner started a new beauty and barber supplies business, and his dream home was bought by the Burchill family in 1974. They finished the design with Lautner's help.

In the 1980s, the movie Less Than Zero was filmed at the property, and music videos have also been set there, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The family has stayed at the property since buying it in 1974, but Mary Burchill Maxson explained they wanted to sell after the death of her father. Her mother, who is in her 90s, wants to move closer to her children.

'They had great fun, and that is why they stayed so long,' she said.
