The stress of getting married can be a headache, but this bride may have been left with a pain in her neck after dragging this gigantic veil along to her wedding.

The headpiece measured a whopping 520 metres (1706ft) and pulled behind as she said her vows in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China.

The gown was designed by the groom with every metre representing each day they had been dating.

With red petals scattered across the cream material, well-wishers held the veil as the couple exchanged their vows on a stand.

But she didn't beat the world record - that was set by in 2011 by Elena De Angelis who needed 600 people to help her carry her headpiece.

It was made from 3.7 miles of white silk and was two metres wide.
