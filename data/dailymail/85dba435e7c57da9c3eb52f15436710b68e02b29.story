Bournemouth let their promotion rivals steal a march at the top of the Championship after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Cardiff.

Harry Arter fired in from range to give Eddie Howe's men an early lead, before Bruno Ecuele-Manga made the wasteful Cherries pay.

Middlesborough's triumph at Derby and Watford's win against Wigan means Bournemouth slip two points behind the automatic places into third.

Andre Gray's 84th-minute winner severely dented Blackburn's aims of finishing in the Sky Bet Championship play-off spots as sixth-placed Brentford moved 11 points clear of them.

Gray came off the bench to score a fortuitous winner six minutes from time after the Bees had earlier twice come from behind to record a 3-2 win which maintained their all-important position in the top six.

Clinical finishes from Rudy Gestede and Chris Taylor either side of Chris Long's deflected effort had given Rovers a half-time lead as they looked to cut the gap on their opponents to five points.

However, after Jota had levelled early in the second half, Gray scored a goal which may have ended Blackburn's' top-six aspirations once and for all with eight games to go.

Charlton made it four Sky Bet Championship wins in their last five games with a 3-0 victory over bottom side Blackpool at a deserted Bloomfield Road.

Simon Church's second-half strike doubled the visitors' lead after Chris Eagles had put them in front in the first period against his old club and Johann Berg Gudmundsson's third added insult to injury.

Blackpool are now without a win in their last 10 games and have lost their last six - taking their tally of defeats in the league to 24.

Jay Tabb scored a priceless 79th minute winner as Ipswich Town got their play-off dreams back on track with a 1-0 win over Bolton Wanderers.

The midfielder earned Ipswich their first win in five matches after a dour match at Portman Road that seemed destined to end goalless.

Bolton, who have not won away for two months, were guilty of missing some golden chances through impressive debutant Rochinha and Craig Davies in the final minute.
