Passengers aboard a British Airways jumbo jet escaped unhurt after their transatlantic flight was forced to make an emergency landing today.

Emergency crews raced to the scene as Heathrow-bound BA flight 196 was forced to divert to Cardiff International Airport this morning hours after taking off from Houston in the United States.

Pilots made the diversion after spotting a 'potential technical problem'.

The flight landed safely at 10.43am, the airline confirmed this afternoon.

None of the 138 passengers or staff on board were injured and the airline said that the Boeing 747 was examined by engineers on the ground after landing.

The flight has now resumed its journey on to London.

A statement issued by BA said: 'Following comprehensive checks carried out by our engineers, our flight from Houston (BA196) will now continue on to London.

'As a precaution, the aircraft was diverted to Cardiff Airport due to indications of a potential technical problem.

'We apologise to customers for the delay to their journey.'

A spokesman for the airline added: 'It was very much a precaution, obviously the safety of our passengers is paramount.'

Cardiff International Airport today confirmed that fire engines and ambulance crews were on hand should anything go wrong with the landing.

An airport spokesman said: 'The flight landed without any issues but as a full emergency was in place all our teams were deployed on the ground.'
