When Dr Abdul Shakoor moved to Britain with his wife and five children, he believed his family would be safe.

But on the night of October 14, 2012, his world was shattered when his entire family was killed in a fire at their home in Harlow, Essex.

The devastated father has now spoken for the first time about his desperate attempts to save them.

Speaking to The Sunday Times he described how before he went up to bed that evening, his wife Sabah, 44, who was also a doctor, had asked him to check everything was safe and secure.

But at 1.40am the couple were woken up with a loud bang and the house was quickly filling up with smoke.

Realising the ferocity of the fire, Shakoor knew he had to get help quick and after fumbling to find his glasses and phone he bravely jumped out of the front window and landed on a car parked below.

A neighbour tried to get into the house but turned back because there was too much smoke, he said. 

But the doctor knew he had to do something and made one last desperate attempt to get back inside the house to save his family. But it was too late.

As he fought his way up the stairs he called out the names of his beloved family members, one by one. But no one answered.

'Every second seemed like a hundred thousand hours,' he said.

All six victims died of asphyxiation through smoke inhalation.

His wife Sabah died at the scene with their 12-year-old daughter Hira and sons Muneeb, 9, and Rayyan, 6.

Sohaib, 11, died at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow where Dr Shakoor worked.

The fifth and youngest child, Maheen, three, who would have celebrated her fourth birthday nine days after the fire never regained consciousness.

Her father had to make the painful decision to turn off her life support machine.

Dr Shakoor said he does not know why his wife and children did not follow him out the window on the night of the blaze.

He said: 'They were all my life. In a small period of time. I lost everything.'

Police are treating the incident as a
murder investigation but there have been no arrests.

They believe the 
house may have been burgled before it was set alight and Dr  Shakoor's laptop and bag were found by schoolchildren 12 days after the fire.

Dr Shakoor has now moved back to his 
native Karachi, in Pakistan, where he has been consoled by family. He said that while he is not vengeful, he wants justice for his family.

Anyone with information should contact the police inquiry team on 01277 266869 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Tragedy: Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on brickwork, and the walls are black with smoke
