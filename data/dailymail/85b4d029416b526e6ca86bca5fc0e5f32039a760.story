A notorious beggar, who is deemed the worst in Britain, has officially been banned from begging anywhere in the UK.

Sukhvender Singh Deo, who is known as Billy the Quid because he always asks passers-by for £1, has a string of Asbos to his name banning him from scrounging in the street.

The 43-year-old was even jailed for two years in October 2011 after relentlessly targeting a widow over a four-year period between 2007 and 2011, begging an astonishing £35,000 from her.

The court heard at the time how Deo targeted legal secretary Bridget Macedonski after she was kind to him and gave him a few pounds whenever she saw him in Chatham, Kent.

Over a period of four years, Deo persuaded Mrs Macedonski to give him her mobile phone number and repeatedly called her to ask for loans of up to £100-a-time over four years.

Maidstone Crown Court heard at the time that he managed to get £35,000 out of Mrs Macedonski, who had been left a sum of money when her husband died at the age of 40.

Deo was jailed for two years in October 2011, getting three months for harassment, 12 months for breaching his Asbo and nine months for two counts of perverting the course of justice - all to run consecutively.

But after getting out of jail last year, Deo appeared on the streets again - hanging around in old haunts in Chatham town centre, as well as other parts of Kent.

Deo was first handed an Asbo in 2006 banning him from begging in Chatham and from engaging in behaviour 'likely to cause harassment, alarm and distress to the public'.

He was handed another Asbo in 2010 banning him from begging in the county of Kent, but this week he was hauled before magistrates again - and this time banned from begging anywhere in the UK.

Medway JPs heard how Deo, who admitted harassment without violence, was caught begging numerous times since August last year.

Sergeant Craig West, of Kent Police, said the new Asbo would mean that Deo could be jailed if caught begging anywhere in Britain.

He said: ‘If Deo is seen begging anywhere in the country, he is breaching the order.

‘If this happens he would be committing a crime and could be prosecuted.’

He said: ‘Deo is well known across the Medway Towns, particularly in Chatham, for being a nuisance and persistently harassing members of the public by aggressively begging for money.

‘People visiting our High Streets to go shopping, or to use cash machines, should be able to do so without being approached for money and faced with this type of behaviour.

‘The order is in place to protect the public from further nuisance behaviour and it is hoped that the local community is reassured by the action taken.

‘If he breaches the order, which continues until 10 March 2017, he could be arrested, charged and put before a court.’

The Asbo bans Deo from 'begging or seeking charitable donations, alms or loans from any person other than a registered charity or a financial institution, loitering in the vicinity of any cash dispensing machine, or acting in an anti-social manner that causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to anyone not of the same household as himself'.

Maidstone Crown Court heard in 2011 how Deo 'relentlessly' targeted Mrs Macedonski for four years.

The court heard how Deo followed legal secretary Mrs Macedonski home, pestered her in the street and sent her numerous text messages telling her he needed cash quickly.

In the end Mrs Macedonski, who is in her 40s, ended up re-mortgaging her home, and eventually selling it to keep paying Deo, who said he needed the cash to pay off drug debts, telling her he 'would be killed' if he didn't pay up.

Martin Yale, prosecuting, told the court that Deo 'preyed on Mrs Macedonski's better nature' and that she even started going to great lengths to avoid bumping into him by getting off her train three miles before her stop.

He said: ‘To avoid him she would get off the train at Gillingham and then walk to Chatham, but if he didn't see her, Deo would call her mobile phone.

‘She began to feel quite intimidated.'

In a victim impact statement read in court, Mrs Macedonski said: ‘The fact he has abused my trust is sad and disappointing, but I cannot help thinking that without the support of others encouraging him he would not have managed to go so far.’

Judge Martin Joy told Deo: ‘This was a wholly disgraceful course of conduct by you preying on somebody who had sought to come to your aid and you preyed on her better instincts.

‘Even now, she has considerable sympathy for you.’

Locals say Deo is 'notorious' in the area - where he has been begging for a decade.

Ben Smart, 32, said: ‘I first saw Billy about 10 years ago - he always says the same thing “Alright mate, got a pound?”

‘When he was in jail it was a massive relief as he follows you up the street begging for change and it's not easy to get away from him.’

He is even listed in the Urban Dictionary because he is so well known in the area.

It states: ‘Billy The Quid - Annoying homeless chap given the Asbo from Chatham High Street.

‘So called because he never fails to ask passers-by for a quid.’
