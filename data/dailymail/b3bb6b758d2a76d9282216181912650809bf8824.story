Dr Corascendea Cathar caught by a BBC investigation claiming she can treat cancer with special remedy

A spiritual healer who claims she can treat cancer with a special diet has been condemned by medical experts for giving 'dangerous advice'.

Slovakian Dr Corascendea Cathar, 62, who has no medical qualifications, claims her 'Dhaxem' healing can prolong the lives of cancer victims by combating tumours. She was charging £280 a session.

Today she has fought back and said the journalist who came to her as a customer saying her had cancer deserves it for misrepresenting her.

But Professor Chris Bunce of charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research has hit out at Dr Cathar, saying that what she claims is 'scary'.

Dr Cathar, whose real name is Dagmar Ebster-Grosz, from Cheltenham, maintains her treatments can help patients.

Following the investigation by the BBC's Inside Out West TV programme Dr Cathar took the details of her treatments and price list off her website.

The BBC undercover team took former cancer patient Chris Geiger, from North Somerset, to secretly film an appointment with Dr Cathar.

For the purposes of the filming, Mr Geiger, who was treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma when in his 20s, claimed to have had a relapse and be looking for treatment.

According to Dr Cathar's website, 'Dhaxem is a form of healing that centres around the understanding of own purpose in life. It incorporates the full array of all natural components working together in harmony and with the view of advancing the person to the next stage.'

She believes it is impossible to repair an ailing body without searching for the roots of the disease in the Soul. 

In a two-hour session, Dr Cathar gave Mr Geiger dietary advice and told him: 'If you want to stop cancer, you have to get high doses of quality calcium.'

She also told him that only he could heal his disease and needed to live a 'pure' life to do so.

Dr Cathar 
sent out a detailed diet to Mr Geiger for a £90 fee. The diet recommended cabbage 
juice 'as it beats cancer' and a particular herbal mixture which Cancer 
Research UK says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers

'My Divine Spirit Guide Lysseus made Dhaxem available to me in December 2002, when he started speaking to me. 

Lysseus sees the energies in every molecule of my body and he specified several times a day what was needed for my repair (of hip joints).

Lysseus equally saw every event that formed my Soul and what I did to bring about my every experience. All made sense, and as I purified, my body repaired at an equal rate.

Since meeting in Egypt 560 BC, Lysseus and I shared 24 of the 28 pivotal incarnations that we each had.

We were sisters, we were a couple, and we were un-related. We died as a Cathar husband and wife in the 13th Century in France, and we met as two men with different interests during Renaissance, in today's Italy. We were friends and we were enemies. The connection between our Souls formed over the two and a half thousands of years of our Spiritual Growth is not subject to time, or place.'

She claimed to have added ten years onto the life of a patient with terminal cancer.

After the appointment, Dr Cathar also 
sent out a detailed diet for a £90 fee. The diet recommended cabbage 
juice 'as it beats cancer' and a particular herbal mixture which Cancer 
Research UK says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers.

After the visit, Mr Geiger said: 'It makes me feel really angry when I heard what she was saying today. I just so hope that people aren't taken for it and that she stops what she is doing immediately."

Prof Bunce, who is research director for the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research charity and a Professor of Experimental Haematological Oncology at University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, viewed the BBC's undercover footage.

He said of Dr Cathar's advice: 'I think it's dangerous. You've got to remember the people she's talking to are scared and frightened.

'You know this kind of thing goes on but to actually see it happening is quite scary.'

Speaking to Mail Online, Dr Cathar said: 'I work in a non-conventional way and my website says this.

'I work under the guidance of my spiritual guide, whereas these doctors work from books. It's a matter of opinion.

Dr Corascendea Cathar's website  no longer offers her services as a healer and now functions solelyy as a means of educating others about Dhaxem

'I had been working on a detox diet 
for this guy and was going through hundreds of different ingredients and
 my spiritual guide told me cabbage juice would work for him .

He then went away and wrote all these things about me which are just not relevant to what I do.

'I can say if he does have cancer he deserves it.

'It's like going to the Chinese and complaining that you can't buy normal groceries.'

Dr Cathar claims to have cured three people with cancer and her website shows the profiles of two dogs which she claims she treated for cancer.

Since removing the pricing and details of her treatment she says she no longer practices and instead works as a linguist and uses her Dhaxem website purely to educate others.

In summer of 2003, Sophie looked suddenly gaunt. Her strong muscles were disappearing from her body as I watched. The speed of her deterioration horrified me. We seemed to be running out of time. I asked Lysseus (Dr Cathar's spiritual guide) whether he would heal Sophie of the cancer, and he said 'Yes'.

To succeed, even a carnivore had to be made vegan, as entirely toxins free fish would have been difficult and red meet practically impossible, to find in a supermarket or at a butcher. Fighting a malignant outbreak in the body requires an immune system as efficient as can be, and lumbering it with toxic intake via meat as 'food', would have defeated the purpose.I cooked for Sophie a diet of crushed aduki with a smaller amount of mung beans, with organic oats and rye (after meat, wheat is also unsuitable for cancer), and I gave her multiple calcium, vitamin and mineral formulas in under normal circumstances unacceptable amounts - every three hours, day and night, for the first three weeks, which then extended to every six hours for another two months. I understood from Lysseus that although new cancer cells were still being made, after this phase, the body's immune system became strong enough to reduce their numbers by about the same rate as they generated, which meant that the spread of the cancer was under control.

Treatment over the subsequent three months allowed us to suppress the disease. Within about four months from starting the treatment, Sophie's immune system became able to render harmless all existing, as well as the developing cancer cells in her body.

Maintaining moderate amounts of calcium and other remedies over the next three years helped Sophie's body to gather the malignant cells into clearly defined pockets which were surgically removed in three stages by April 2006.
