Owners of vicious dogs will not be jailed even if their pet kills, under proposed changes to sentencing.

The Sentencing Council published plans yesterday recommending that a dog owner receive a lesser sentence if the animal was provoked into the attack.

An owner could also avoid prison if they tried to get their dog under control before its victim died, or if the animal killed while they were momentarily distracted or briefly lost control.

The changes will now be subject to a three-month consultation period.

The Council is led by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and sets down rules that judges and magistrates must abide by.

Its report said that new guidelines are necessary to deal with the new law and guide the courts on cases ‘of the utmost seriousness involving a fatality’. 

However, critics accused the changes of undermining the Dangerous Dogs Act, put into force last year, which increased the maximum sentence a dog owner whose pet kills can receive to 14 years.

The reformed law was brought in after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was mauled to death by four dogs when she visited a friend’s house in 2013. 

But the plans published yesterday say that if the dog owner or handler has ‘lesser culpability’ then a deadly attack by their animal could lead to a community sentence rather than a prison term if they are convicted under the Act. 

Jade Anderson, 14, was mauled to death by four dogs in 2013, prompting the introduction of the Dangerous Dogs Act 

Such a sentence could mean less than a month’s unpaid work or four months of electronic tagging.

The proposals recommend that the maximum sentence might go to ‘someone who has bred or trained a dog to be aggressive and uses the dog as a weapon or to intimidate people, whose dog carries out a fatal attack’. 

Evidence of lesser culpability, the consultation paper said, would include the provocation of the dog without any fault on the part of the owner. It would also bring a lesser sentence if the owner tried to restrain the animal, had tried to control it, could not have foreseen the attack, or had a momentary lapse of control or attention.

Circuit Judge Julian Goose, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: ‘Most dog owners are responsible, care for their pets properly and keep them under control but some irresponsible owners put others at risk of injury or death and we want to ensure that the courts have the guidance needed to help them sentence offenders appropriately.

‘In drawing up our proposals, we have been very aware of the potentially devastating impact of these offences on victims. Long sentences are available for the most serious offences. Sentencers are also encouraged to use their powers where appropriate to ban people from keeping dogs or to order them to pay compensation to victims.’

Trevor Cooper of the Dogs Trust said: ‘We are pleased to see the proposals recognise that there can be a range of culpability on the part of offenders for these offences, and that courts should carefully consider the appropriate sentence in each case.’ 

But criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think-tank disagreed: ‘If there is a fatal attack the owner should always be held responsible and society should signal its strong disapproval by insisting on a prison sentence. To do otherwise is putting a low value on human life.’

He added: ‘It might be that you have your dog on a lead and someone pokes it with a stick. But if you have a dog, whatever the circumstances, you cannot allow it to kill someone. If you do you should go to jail. The starting point for causing a death should be a serious custodial sentence.’
