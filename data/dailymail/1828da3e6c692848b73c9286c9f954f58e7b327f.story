A rider had a miraculous escape after their horse slipped into a steep muddy ditch and became trapped for two hours.

The unhurt rider clambered out of the ditch near the village of Harringworth, Northamptonshire, but firefighters had to use special winching equipment to rescue the horse which was trapped on its side.

A Northamptonshire Fire & Rescue Service crew from Corby used an animal rescue harness to help free the adult horse from the ditch, which was muddy following the recent wet weather.

A specialist animal rescue unit from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, also helped to rescue the horse, which slipped into the ditch at around 11am on Sunday.

A spokesman for the fire service said: ‘It was a large horse measuring 17.3 hands and the sides of the ditch were steep. Its rider was able to get out uninjured and called the vet straight away.’

The horse was also uninjured and after a short rest the owner walked it back to its stables.
