Gina Rinehart's wealth has dropped more than $2 billion in the past year because of a fall in iron ore prices, according to the 2014 BRW Rich 200 list.

But the mining magnate is still the richest person in Australia with a wealth of $20.1 billion, and her wealth is set to rise again next year when it is expected that her Roy Hill project will start shipping ore.

Another Australian to take a hit on this year's Rich List - which will be released in full on Friday - is Clive Palmer, whose wealth has fallen $1 billion from $2.2 billion to $1.2 billion.

Gina Rinehart is still the richest person in Australia with a wealth of $20.1 billion, despite her wealth dropping more than $2 billion in the past year thanks to a fall in iron ore prices, according to the 2014 BRW Rich 200 list 

BRW editor Michael Bailey said the colourful Mr Palmer, whose Palmer United Party is set to take balance of power in the Senate on July 1, suffered a drop in personal wealth thanks to problems at his iron ore mine, Sino Iron.

He was also hit by issues with royalties from Chinese government-owned company Citic.

'He's always very contentious because Clive being Clive there's always a lot of intangibles and smoke and mirrors,' Mr Bailey said.

Ruslan Kogan, founder of online electronics retailer Kogan.com, is a tech entrepreneur and first-timer on the list. The 31-year-old's wealth is expected to be $320 million this year

'On the relationship he has with Citic, there's an agreement for them to pay him royalties for mining, but there's a lot of legal battles and the thinking is the royalty stream won't be as lucrative in the future.'

In more positive news, young tech entrepreneurs have come storming up the charts in 2014.

The 34-year-old founders of software company Atlassian, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, have become billionaires for the first time with a combined worth of $2.1 billion.

'They've been on the rich list before and they had an investment this year from a fund manager and now they're worth a billion dollars each,' Mr Bailey said.

Another tech entrepreneur and first-timer on the list is 31-year-old Ruslan Kogan, founder of online electronics retailer Kogan.com, whose wealth is expected to be $320 million this year.

The Rich List's youngest debutante is 30-year-old Owen Kerr, co-founder of online foreign currency firm Pepperstone, who has a wealth of $250 million.

'It's not like, say, Frank Lowy who had to build his wealth over a long time,' Mr Bailey said.

'These guys are doing it very quickly because that's just the nature of technology.'

The oldest debutante is 81-year-old Zip Industries founder Michael Crouch, who sold a large portion of his company to a private equity firm and is now worth $310 million.

Casino magnate James Packer comes in at third on the list with $7.2 billion

'[Mr Crouch] took over a small hot water system company in the '60s and invented this technology for instant boiling water,' Mr Bailey said.

'It just shows that there is still a way of succeeding with manufacturing in Australia.'

Rounding out the top five list was packaging billionaire Anthony Pratt who increased his wealth by $1.69 billion to an estimated $7.6 billion this year.

Casino magnate James Packer is worth $7.19 billion, up $1.19 billion from last year, while co-founder of Westfield Frank Lowy increased his fortune by $288 million to be worth an estimated $7.16 billion.

Glencore Xstrata CEO Ivan Glasenberg is now worth $6.6 billion after increasing his wealth by $1 billion since last year.
