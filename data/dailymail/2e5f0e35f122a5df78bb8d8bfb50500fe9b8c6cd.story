This time last year he was earning £850 per week. Now, West Brom striker Saido Berahino is among the Barclays Premier League's top goalscorers and a member of the senior England squad.

A new deal in December 2013 saw the 21 year old with seven Premier League goals bump his pay to £12,000 a week, a modest sum compared to others in lesser form at the same level.

There is a reason Manchester United and Liverpool are loitering, and why West Brom are scurrying to tie Berahino down to a new contract that would double his salary at the Hawthorns.

But against Newcastle on Sunday, the striker found himself frustrated more often than not.

Berahino started, having been named in Roy Hodgson's 26-man English squad for games against Slovenia and Scotland next week.

He has Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool's Rickie Lambert to compete with for a place, and Sunday's match was an audition of sorts. 

Berahino, valued at £25million, was regularly pushed wide for the visit of Newcastle.

The forward introduced himself  with a shot from 20 yards out after being fed by Victor Anichebe. 

It called for a one-handed save from goalkeeper Tim Krul to loop over the crossbar, though that would prove to be his only shot of the match.

But there seems an instinctive partnership developing between Berahino and Anichebe. 

The two complement each other and work in tandem, even if it proved ineffective on Sunday.

Berahino was offered little space and struggled to muster a chance he could call his own while on the wing, and his heat map suggests the striker found it difficult to become involved.

In the end, the  youth product could not add to his seven Premier League goals, and will have to wait until after the international break to add to that tally against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

But there's no doubting Berahino's ambitions. 'My aim would be to play in the Champions League, to be involved in the England seniors and go and play in World Cups and Euros,' he admits.

One of those was ticked off by Hodgson this week, and his senior debut awaits.

The rest will have to wait, most likely until he leaves the Hawthorns for a club that can offer European football.

But West Brom manager Alan Irvine has a word of advice for the striker, having seen the pitfalls that younger players can fall into.

'If you keep on going about your job in that way, keep living life as you have been, then things will happen,' Irvine says. 'Berahino has the potential to be a top player.

'But like every young player, he needs to make sure he keeps his focus and doesn't get distracted outside the training ground and the pitch.' 

The stage is set for the potential England star. Whether he takes it is up to him.
