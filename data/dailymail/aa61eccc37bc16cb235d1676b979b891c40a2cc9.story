A massive offshore wind farm scheme designed to power a  million homes has been axed, raising the risk that Britain could be hit by blackouts.

German company RWE pulled the plug on the £4billion, 240-turbine Atlantic Array project in the  Bristol Channel, citing ‘technical challenges’ and spiralling costs.

But critics yesterday blamed disagreements within the Coalition for creating uncertainty and discouraging investment in renewable energy.

David Cameron has said he wants to ‘roll 
back’ green taxes in next week’s autumn statement, with senior Tory 
sources last week alleging he ordered ministers to ditch the ‘green 
c**p’.

But leading Liberal Democrats remain committed to green levies, which  currently add £112 to the average bill, and pay for clean energy such as wind farms and solar panels.

An industry insider said: ‘The mixed messages coming from government over whether it  supports renewables has undermined investor confidence.

‘Without a consistent approach, this will not be the last large-scale project that gets pulled.’

There are 22 offshore wind farms in operation, supplying power for 2.5million homes.

Another 24 are either being built or in the pipeline, with offshore wind expected to generate enough electricity for 15million homes in the next decade.

Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum Capital bank, said scrapping the Atlantic Array could risk energy security.

‘The reason the Government liked offshore wind was that you can build them in really big chunks and they produce a lot of power, unlike onshore wind,’ he added. ‘When big coal plants come offline, you have to have something that can replace them.

'New nuclear won’t be ready until the end of the next decade. Now it looks like wind won’t be ready until then as well, so what will replace our coal?’

Paul Cowling, director of offshore wind 
at RWE, said: ‘Given the technological challenges and market conditions,
 now is not the right time for RWE to  continue to progress with this 
project.’

Claims: Critics blame Coalition for discouraging investment in renewable energy for the company's decision to pull the plug on the project

The Atlantic Array had drawn criticism from environmentalists, concerned about its impact on marine wildlife, and campaigners who branded the planned 720ft-high turbines  as unsightly.

But Friends of the Earth spokesman Andrew Pendleton said: ‘Wanton green-bashing by some at the heart of the  Coalition is starting to cost jobs and threaten the future security of our energy supply.’

Ed Miliband has also been accused of fuelling uncertainty after pledging to freeze energy prices for almost two years if Labour wins the next election.

Last month, National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years. The number of coal-based power plants in the UK has fallen sharply due to EU legislation, which has caused older, polluting, fossil-fuel plants to be turned off.

Plans for some gas-fired plants have been suspended because of economic pressures.

A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘The decision was made on purely technical grounds and reflects the many complex challenges of constructing offshore wind farms. The UK still expects to deploy significant amounts of offshore wind by 2020 and we remain well placed to meet our 2020 renewable energy target.’
