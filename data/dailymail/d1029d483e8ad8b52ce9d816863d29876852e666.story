A Darwin man has died after he was struck by a falling tree branch while playing golf.

William ‘Bill’ Brown, 62, was waiting to tee off during a game with friends at the Gardens Golf Links in Darwin last Friday when a branch snapped off and came down on top of him.

The branch caused damaged to his spine, as well as other injuries and over the weekend friends and family believed Mr Brown was paralysed, but would survive the accident.

William 'Bill' Brown, 62, died at an Adelaide hospital about 2.30pm yesterday with his wife and stepdaughter Kerry Collins by his side

He was taken to the Royal Darwin Hospital and later flown to Adelaide, where he passed away yesterday, with his wife Gail and step-daughter Kerry Collins by his side.

Mr Brown was a shot firer in quarries and mines in the Northern Territory and was a keen baseballer.

He had belonged to the Palmerston Reds Baseball Club for more than thirty years, where he played in the Masters competition, as well as coaching and scoring, and acting as a mentor to younger players.

Lisa Hooley, the State Executive Officer of the club, said the community was 'absolutely devastated' by the news of his death.

'Billy would always have a smile and have a chat, he was a true, decent guy, a family man. He loved to have a beer with his friends and his teammates,' she told MailOnline.

She said he was fit and loved his sport, playing golf whenever he got a Friday off work.

'But baseball was his great love,' she said.

The community was particularly shocked, she said, because they initially thought Mr Brown had survived the accident and the baseball club had already started fundraising to help with his rehabilitation costs.

Ms Hooley said the phone call informing her of Mr Brown's death was 'one of the most horrific calls I’ve had in a long time'.

'The golf course is a place where a lot of our members go. I don’t think there’s anyone in our club who hasn’t stood on that first tee.

'It was just such a random incident and I know there’s a big outcry to take out the trees. But seriously a tree? I get lost for words, it’s just such a random event,' she said.

Mr Brown was hit by a branch of an African mahogany tree, which have been the target of complaints from residents in the area.

A nine-year-old boy was killed in 2006 when a branch of the African mahogany tree fell on him in 2006.

Ms Hooley said the Palmerston Reds were playing a game tonight and the players would wear black armbands and have a minute of silence.

'They're playing tonight which is just incredible, they’ve decided to play because that’s what Billy would’ve wanted.'
