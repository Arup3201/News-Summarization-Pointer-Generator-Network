A chemistry graduate student faces up to 20 years in prison after spending his spare time allegedly running a meth factory out of his flat.

Randy Lambreghts, 28, who is at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, was making the illegal drug in a student residence, police said.

A room-mate called cops because he was worried for the Belgian scientistâ€™s health - and then police found the alleged drug factory there.

Charged: Randy Lambreghts, 28, who is at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, was making meth in a student residence, police said

Lambreghts lives in a building with around a dozen graduate students - in an area densely populated by students, reported the New York Daily News.

Campus officials called town cops after finding evidence of a mini drug factory, before firefighters and drug experts also responded, police said.

The building was evacuated and Lambreghts was asked to take a shower so he could decontaminate himself before going to hospital.

Evidence collected by the Drug Enforcement Administration is now being analysed at a laboratory, police told the New York Daily News.

Dartmouth College: Lambreghts has been at the Ivy League school for around seven years and his research is related to the circadian internal body clock

Lambreghts is being held on $20,000 bail after being charged with attempted manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine.

The two people living with Lambreghts, who has been at the Ivy League school for around seven years, are not expected to be charged.

He has already received a chemistry bachelor's degree and a biochemistry master's from the University of Ghent in Belgium.

Meth manufacture is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $300,000, reported the New Hampshire Union Leader.
