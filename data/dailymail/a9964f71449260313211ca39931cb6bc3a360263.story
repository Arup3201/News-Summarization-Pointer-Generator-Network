Manchester United's German-based scout Peter Braund watched Roberto Firmino on Saturday.

The Hoffenheim midfielder has been monitored by Premier League clubs over recent seasons and United are the latest to check on his progress.

Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal have all considered bids for the 23-year-old Brazilian who has a release clause reputedly set at £14.5million.

Brazil international Firmino is said to have a £14.5million release clause inserted into his contract 

The 23-year-old has been linked with moves to Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal during the past few years 

Firmino played 86 minutes for Hoffenheim on Saturday in a 3-0 win over Hamburg but failed to really impress.

He has scored six goals from midfield this season but can also play as a winger or secondary striker.

Firmino has two caps for Brazil after being called up last year for friendlies against Turkey and Austria. Bundesliga duo Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg have also been following his performances.

Meanwhile, United remain keen on Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne and have expressed an interest in Burnley's coveted striker Danny Ings.
