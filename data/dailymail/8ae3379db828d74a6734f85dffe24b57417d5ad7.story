Jaffas: Reece O'Callaghan has been jailed after he helped himself to food including Jaffa Cakes while burgling an elderly couple's home

A burglar who helped himself to a pack of Jaffa cakes while stealing from an elderly couple's home has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years.

Reece O’Callaghan broke into the property in West Heath Birmingham after smashing a window in July last year.

During his time in the house he helped himself to a pasta meal and some Jaffa Cakes before making off with property including three televisions.

O’Callaghan was spotted by a neighbour and police arrested him nearby but he denied the offence.

However, forensic experts found his finger print on the Jaffa Cake box, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

The court heard the elderly couple, aged 78 and 82, returned from holiday to find their house a mess following the burglary.

O’Callaghan, of West Heath, who had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and aggravated burglary, was given a sentence of seven-and-a-half years.

Judge William Davis QC, said the couple had been left 'devastated' by what the burglar had done and that the elderly woman had been unable to stop crying since the incident.

Judge Davis said the couple were still 'mourning' the loss of sentimental items from their home which could not be replaced because they had been unable to afford house insurance.

He said that in a separate incident in 
December last year the defendant and another young man had 'invaded' the
home of man who had befriended them and who had 'significant health 
problems.'

Evidence: O'Callaghan, 19, denied the burglary - which took place while the couple were on holiday - but his fingerprint was found on the box of Jaffa Cakes

'Armed with a knife you used violence against him and you took his property,' said Judge Davis.

He said they had carried out a second raid, armed with a screwdriver, and stolen some of the victim’s medication.

A 17-year-old, who had admitted aggravated burglary and burglary, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years detention.

Impact: Birmingham Crown Court was told the elderly couple were left 'devastated' by the burglary
