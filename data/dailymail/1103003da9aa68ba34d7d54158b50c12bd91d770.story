Professional footballers take a lot of stick for their apparent lack of intelligence, but Roy Hodgson is keen to get his players away from that stereotype as he regularly tests them on their general knowledge.

As England's Euro 2016 qualifying campaign gets underway, Hodgson is keen to keep his international players' brain power at the highest level possible and regularly puts them through their paces with quiz nights, The Telegraph reports.

'The players I work with always surprise me with their general knowledge and their intelligence,' Hodgson revealed. 'They are a lot better at the quizzes that we have than I am, that's for sure.'

But far from just keeping them up to date with the news, Hodgson - who has been England manager since 2012 - explained that footballers are some of the most intelligent people he has come across, despite the negative stereotype.

'You will be very surprised by the intelligence levels of footballers. It would be a mistake to misjudge them, I think footballers are some of the brainiest people I know.' 

Football has progressed a lot in the 38 years Hodgson has been in management, and he claims that nowadays football academies care not only about their players' footballing ability, but also ensure that off-the-field, they complete an education.

'The football academies these days do take care of the education of young footballers, even if they leave school at 16 it doesn't mean they have to stop their education.

'They continue it alongside their football, which I think is very important.'
