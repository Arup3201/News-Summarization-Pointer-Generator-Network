A woman took her own life after discovering her husband had sexually abused a nine-year-old girl.

Details of the tragic incident emerged yesterday as 64-year-old David Mullinger was jailed for three years over the abuse, in what a judge called a 'desperately sad case'.

His wife Jenny, 62, walked in front of a train in September after he confessed to touching the girl twice, including once under her clothes, Bristol Crown Court heard.

Tragic case: A judge at Bristol Crown Court told David Mullinger, 64, that his wife's suicide was 'desperately sad'. She walked in front of a train after discovering he had sexually abused a nine-year-old girl

Mullinger was arrested  after the girl told her mother he had been 'fiddling' with her, prompting the girl's shocked parents to phone police.

He initially denied the offences, but two days later rang officers in tears to confess he was responsible, the court heard.

Following the confession, Mrs Mullinger walked in front of a train near the railway station in Yate, South Gloucestershire.

She was pronounced dead at the scene at 8.03am on September 16.

Judge Martin Picton told him: 'I'm sure you're only too aware of the awful harm you've done'

Mullinger, of Rangeworthy, South Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to two sexual assaults on a child aged under 13.

Jailing him for three years, Judge Martin Picton told him: 'This is a desperately sad case.

'I'm sure you're only too aware of the awful harm you've done.'

Mullinger was also handed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from unsupervised contact with children under 16. 

Virginia Cornwall, defending, told the court: 'He feels the impact daily.

'He suffers himself daily. He bears responsibility and knows the consequences such as the loss of his wife.

'She took her own life and that has impacted on everyone for the rest of their lives.' 

Kenneth Bell, prosecuting, read a victim impact statement from the mother of the girl who was abused.

'Prior to this abuse she was a happy, carefree and innocent child with no knowledge of anything sexual whatsoever,' the girl's mother wrote.

'Now this is no longer the case. The anger she feels about what happened to her is immense.

'My heart breaks at the thought of the long journey that lies ahead for her in order to recover from something like this.'
