Jailed alleged murderer Aaron Hernandez has shared his worries with a 'pen pal' that his infant daughter will forget him if he stays in prison.

Facing the grim possibility of a lifetime behind bars, the NFL star hand-wrote a two-page letter to Collin Imm saying that he desperately missed his nine-month-old daughter Avielle Janelle, with fiancé Shayanna Jenkins.

Sitting in a Massachusetts jail cell with time to kill, the former New England Patriots tight end also declared he was a 'good dude' and had always wanted to play basketball.

Sentimental: Accused killer Aaron Hernandez has written to a pen pal that he fears never knowing his baby daughter

Hernandez, 23, specifically asked in the  letter obtained by RadarOnline that the correspondence remain 'private'.

The NFL star, accused of killing 
semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd on June 17, has pleaded not
guilty to murder and is being held without bail.

Deadspin reports the undated letter was passed to Imm by the Bristol County Sheriff's Office.

This is reportedly the third 'pen pal' letter from Hernandez to appear online. It is not clear who Imm is.

Hernadez wrote, as transcribed by RadarOnline:

'Collin,Hey brotha, let me start by saying thanks for the support, it definitely means alot! Everything happens for a reason in life in both of our situations. Whatever obstacles/struggles will only make us stronger.

We actually have something in common because my dream as a kid was to play in NBA an is still my favorite sport but had a better chance in football! Never be down from your incident because 'God' has a plan before all of us & that's why I'll never be down!

Stay away from all negative people so your always there for your little boy cuz I miss by little girl terribly an my biggest fear of all is she wont know daddy! She said daddy first time or should I say 'DaDa' and had to hear it from jail.

Im going fine but wanted to write you and definitely wanted to say thanks for the support! Hope to hear back from you if wanted! Please keep this private is all I ask!———>Thanks again,AaronP.S. Im a great dude don't believe all the neg. publicity please!*Media is the Negative of the fame! Stay up and keep a smile on that babys face & Be there for him!Thanks again brotha!'

Involved? Investigators are examining whether Hernandez's fiance Shayanna Jenkins might have played a role in disposing of the gun used to kill Odin Lloyd, who was dating her sister, Shaneah

Hernandez’s letter was postmarked July 17 from Inmate No. 174594 – his jail identification number.

While the fiancé of the fallen football star has not been charged in connection with Lloyd's slaying, authorities have alleged that Jenkins 'made overt attempts to hide evidence, render assistance for suspect to elude law enforcement and to hinder and mislead' the investigation.

Lloyd was dating Jenkins’ sister, Shaneah, according to The Washington Post.
