Shocked Downton Abbey viewers have complained to advertising watchdogs after a commercial showing a man choking to death in front of his family was screened during Sunday night’s episode.

The 60-second clip – part of a campaign by St John Ambulance to encourage people to learn first aid – features a father breaking the news that he has cancer to his partner before making a gruelling recovery.

But in a gruesome twist, he chokes during a barbecue and collapses, purple-faced, to the ground.

The advert, which will be seen by ten million people tonight, features a cancer survivor choking to death

As his horrified daughter looks on, he
dies because none of his friends or family are able to help. It closes 
with the message: ‘First aid could help prevent the deaths of 140,000 
every year. The same number that die from cancer.

Be the difference.’ The hard-hitting 
advert – shown after the 9pm watershed during the first episode of the 
ITV1 costume drama’s third series –  prompted 22 complaints to the 
Advertising Standards Authority.

Writing on Twitter, one viewer said: 
‘Gosh, St John’s Ambulance have just managed to make the most harrowing 
advert I have EVER seen.’

Another said it was ‘too graphic’.

However, Sue Killen, of St John 
Ambulance, defended it, saying: ‘Lives are being tragically lost because
people don’t perceive a lack of first aid as life-threatening, but it 
is.

‘We need to raise awareness that first
aid can be the difference between life and death, even if it takes a 
somewhat shocking  TV advert to do it.’

It is understood the advert may 
also air during next week’s episode of X Factor.

'Hard-hitting': The advert filmed for St John Ambulance is 'makes a big point', says Vivienne Pattison from campaign group Media Watch

Distressing: The man is then shown lying dead on the lawn in a scene which is likely to shock many viewers

Yesterday, a spokesman for the 
Advertising Standards Authority said it would decide whether to 
investigate the complaints further in the coming days.

He said all adverts were vetted before being screened to make sure they did not breach advertising codes.

■ Sunday night’s opening episode, 
which saw the Downton debut of Shirley MacLaine, attracted an average 
audience of 8.6million – down 300,000 from last year’s series opener.

The first 15 minutes peaked with an 
impressive 9.1million viewers. However, more than 600,000 switched off 
before the end of the hour-and-a-half-long programme.

The final 15 
minutes were watched by 8.5million.
