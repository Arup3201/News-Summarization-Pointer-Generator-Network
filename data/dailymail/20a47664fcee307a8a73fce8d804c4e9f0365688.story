FA chairman Greg Dyke held surprise clear-the-air talks with FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich this week.

The two are understood to have had a convivial private conversation for about 45 minutes at FIFA headquarters, where Dyke was attending a gathering of the governing body’s fair play and social responsibility committee.

Greg Dyke had a private meeting with FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich

Such a meeting had seemed highly unlikely. In June Blatter accused British media of ‘racism’ for demanding an investigation into allegations of corruption over Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid. Dyke said the comments were ‘offensive and completely unacceptable’ and that the FIFA chief should ‘stop attacking the messenger’.

Dyke has since made clear his distaste for FIFA and instead has concentrated on building relationships with UEFA — until Wednesday’s meeting instigated by Blatter’s UK advisor.

Meanwhile, Jordan’s Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, FIFA vice-president for Asia, has emerged as a possible candidate to stand against Blatter for the presidency. UEFA, who want a credible rival to emerge from somewhere in the world, would certainly consider supporting an Asian bid.

Roy Keane’s book-tour jibes about former players who propagate a Disney-style ‘Man United-land with f****** Mickey Mouse running around’ have been given extra mileage by former captain Bryan Robson. 

A paid Manchester United ambassador, Robson (right) is among the old boys Keane ridicules for their ‘propaganda’. Robson asked a Soccerex forum in Barbados: ‘Is it necessary? If you are going to come out with a book, why not talk about what you have done in the game, the good things, rather than criticise people when there is no need?’ 

But he conveniently ignored the fact that former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had been just as critical about Keane — and others — in his own best-sellers.

Chairman Bruce Buck missed the end of Chelsea's 6-0 demolition of Maribor

When Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck failed to return after leaving the directors’ box during Tuesday’s Champions League match against Maribor, many suspected he had been summoned to arrange the exit of marginalised chief executive Ron Gourlay.

In fact, Buck had prearranged to talk to Surrey Chambers of Commerce. In any case, Chelsea insist Gourlay made his own decision to leave, despite being due to represent the club at a conference in Moscow next month.

Baker barb stings BT

BT Sport have paid the best part of £1billion for the Champions League next season. So they will not be impressed with Danny Baker, one of their star presenters, slating the tournament.

Baker’s numerous tweets included: ‘Wouldn’t bother me so much if TV didn’t treat Champions League like some elite night. This bulls*** is just like the early rounds of FA Cup... It’s got like Eurovision where any nutcase can join in… Might as well let Sunderland into the precious CL next year.’

Wales’ reputation as a rugby-obsessed nation is not reflected in current ticket sales for the 2015 World Cup. Record demand has seen 23 out of 48 games sold out, but seats are still available for all eight matches at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium.

Sport England’s upcoming £10million lottery-funded campaign to persuade more women to enjoy sport, revealed by Sports Agenda on Thursday, may seem excessive. But there is work to be done. A study puts the UK in third place in the list of males under 24 active in sport across Europe. However, in the female table the UK sits in 19th place. 

NFL cool Wembley fever

Hopes for an NFL franchise at Wembley have been raised, with departing FA general secretary Alex Horne calling it a priority and Chancellor George Osborne promising tax breaks.

But the NFL will not be bounced into taking a permanent home at Wembley. They want more trials, including testing support with back-to-back matches next year when it is expected there will be no increase on three matches over here. The NFL, whose Wembley agreement expires in 2016, will also examine other London options before committing to Wembley.
