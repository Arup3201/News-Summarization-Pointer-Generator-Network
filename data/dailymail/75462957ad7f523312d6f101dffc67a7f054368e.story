Father-in-law of missing Susan Powell, Steven Powell is due to be released from jail next month following voyeurism charges

The father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell is nearing the end of his prison sentence and will likely be released to a Tacoma home next month.

Steve Powell, 63, is expected to be released in the first few days of November.

He will be supervised by a community corrections officer, is required to undergo sex offender treatment and will wear a GPS locator for the first 30 days of his release.

Corrections spokesman Chad Lewis said Powell will also have to get permission from his community corrections officer in order to leave Pierce County, Washington.

Powell has been serving time on 
voyeurism charges for secretly recording images of young neighbor girls.

He was sentenced in June 2012.

Susan
Powell disappeared from her home in December 2009.

Her husband, Josh 
Powell, was a focus of the investigation until he killed himself and the
couple's two children last year in an explosive house fire.

Utah
authorities have said they do not believe Steve Powell was directly 
involved with Susan Powell's disappearance but may know more about it 
than he has let on.

He had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police.

Investigators
now believe Josh Powell's brother, Michael, helped him dispose of 
Susan's body. Michael committed suicide by jumping off a parking garage 
in Minneapolis three months ago.

Chuck Cox, Susan’s father, acknowledged Powell’s release on Thursday.

However he told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'That’s between the state and Steve. We’re still looking for our daughter.'

Susan Powell, went missing three years ago and has never been found. She is pictured with her sons Charlie and Braden who were later killed by their father Josh Powell in a home explosion
