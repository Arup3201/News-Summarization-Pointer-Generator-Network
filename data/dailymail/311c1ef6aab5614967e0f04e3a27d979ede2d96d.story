Boxing promoters are responsible for everything from insuring fighters against injury to paying for drug tests and hiring a ring announcer.

Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe said the company knows what it takes to be successful and will continue to grow the sport of boxing, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Mayweather is a licensed promoter in Washington and New York. Ellerbe said the boxer plans to seek licenses in other states.

money their fight will generate, according to the Boxing Insider website.

then in May, I'm fighting in May and I'll have a big surprise for you 
all,' Mayweather has said previously.
