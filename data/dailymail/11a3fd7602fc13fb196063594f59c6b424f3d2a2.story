Lady Ackers wrongly claimed almost £27,000 in benefits because she 'skim read' a booklet and didn't think she would remarry, a court heard

The wealthy widow of a controversial NHS chief wrongly claimed almost £27,000 in benefits because she 'skim read' a Government booklet and didn't think she would remarry, a court heard.

Former magistrate  Jayne Ackers had been receiving Widowed Parent's Allowance (WPA) from March 2008 - shortly after the death of her husband Sir James Ackers.

One of the conditions was that the 56-year-old didn't live with anyone else but a court heard she began co-habiting with boyfriend James McMaster, 58, in October 2010.

JPs were told Lady Ackers informed Lichfield District Council that her new partner had moved into the family's £280,000 home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, Staffordshire, but didn't tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

The nursery director claimed she wasn't aware she had to inform the Government about Mr McMaster until they were married.

The court heard the couple tied the knot at glamorous Blair Castle in Scotland in 2012 but Lady Ackers mistakenly provided the information to HM Revenue and Customs instead of the DWP.

During her trial at Burton Magistrates Court on Friday, the widow was shown an information booklet similar to one that would've been sent to her at the time her WPA claim began.

But she told JPs: 'I was reading so much at the time that I must have skim read it. I remember reading about remarriage and thinking 'that won't be happening'.'

Lady Ackers denied falsely claiming £26,980 by deliberately failing to inform the DWP she was living with Mr McMaster.

And JPs took less than 10 minutes to find her not guilty - a verdict which was met by applause from the widow's family in the public gallery.

Chairman of the bench Mrs Lesley Gilman said: 'Although she failed to declare information to the DWP we don't consider she did it knowingly.'

The court heard Lady Ackers, who was a magistrate in the West Midlands between 1990 and 2011, met Mr McMaster in Austria in 2008 and gave him a maintenance job at her nurseries.

She maintaining her innocence after being interviewed by police in December last year and JPs were told Lady Ackers has paid the money back in full.

Defending, Jonathan Challinor said at the time of Sir James's death, his widow had to take over his role as a director of a nursery, raise two children and make funeral arrangements.

And Lady Ackers told the court: 'It was too much. I was trying to juggle all the balls.'

Lady Ackers  is the director of Seesaws Day Nursery - a company which includes five nurseries, three pre and after-school clubs and two holiday clubs in Birmingham and Wolverhampton, West Mids.

Businessman Sir James  died aged 72 at their home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, in 2008

According to their website, she said up the business with her husband Sir James Ackers in 1994 because she wanted the best care for their son Nicky who they adopted from Romania in 1990.

Businessman Sir James - who was chairman of the West Midlands Regional Health Authority (RHA) for over 10 years - died aged 72 at their home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, in 2008.

The NHS chief had a rollercoaster ride at the helm of the West Midlands RHA and resigned after a string of financial scandals in January 1993.

Residents in the West Midlands raised a protest petition with more than 250,000 signatures after a House of Commons motion which called for his resignation over the controversies.

Die-hard Tory Sir James's career was a textbook rags to riches story and in 1961 he took over the family business Ackers Jarrett started by his dad as a garage in Walsall, West Midlands, 54 years earlier.

Under his control, it flourished to become one of the largest truck-hire companies in Britain with a fleet of 1,800 vehicles until recession struck in 1991.

Sir James, who was born in Walsall, called receivers to the business in August 1991 but carried on as chairman of the West Midlands RHA. 

He was also a national figure as a member of the NHS policy board and a personal friend of ministers including Sir Kenneth Clarke.

But during the later years of his chairmanship of the West Midlands RHA, Sir James had to continually resist calls for his resignation over a string of financial claims

One of the allegations was that consultants were charging the NHS as much as £350,000 in expenses and the £4 million cost to the RHA of an efficiency study by an American firm of consultants.
