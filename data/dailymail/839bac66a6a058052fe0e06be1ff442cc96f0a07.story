Eight-year-old Jessica, with foster mother Carolyn, has become the first person to have her
life-saving oxygen supply transported in her toy luggage

An eight-year-old girl has become the first person to be given a life-saving oxygen supply in her toy luggage.

Jessica has had her Trunki - a suitcase that can be ridden on or pulled along - specially modified to carry the life-saving cylinder.

The eight-year-old suffers from cerebral palsy, pulmonary hypertension and chronic lung disease which means her blood quickly loses oxygen, threatening her with fatal brain damage.

Current mobile oxygen supplies were too big for her, which meant her mother Carolyn Carey, 44, or another adult had to carry it in a rucksack.  

But thanks to Carolyn and the charity
Cerebra, which helps brain injured children and young people -  Jessica
is as free as any other little girl to explore the world with her 
bright pink life-saving luggage in tow.

Ms
Carey said: 'The Trunki is bright pink and the other children don't see
it as something medical, it looks like a toy any of them would use.

'Jessica
used to have to stay with an adult or with me at all times because we 
had the rucksack with oxygen in it, but now she's free to explore on her
own.

'She can use it at 
school or out playing and when we go to hospital for an appointment, 
she's off and in there before I've got chance to get out of the car.

'It's the only one in the country 
like it. Cerebra have stabilised it and added a rigid handle instead of a
strap, but apart from that, it looks just like a Trunki.'

Jessica
was born premature at just 27 weeks and has had cerebral palsy since 
birth. She also suffers from weakness down her left side because of the 
condition.

Her foster 
mother added: 'Without the oxygen Jessica loses energy quickly, she 
becomes irritable and as her blood loses oxygen, it can lead to brain 
damage.

'I wanted her to have the freedom of other girls, as [having an oxygen tank at school] was hard for her.

'When I looked for mobile oxygen carriers, all there were only adult ones, they only had two wheels and were too big.'

A solution came when Carolyn contacted the charity Cerebra, where staff came up with the idea to specially modify the popular child's toy first seen on the TV show Dragon's Den.

Jessica's foster mother Carolyn said: 'She used to have to stay with an adult or with me at all times because we had the rucksack with oxygen in it, but now she's free to explore on her own'

Elaine Collins, from Cerebra, said: 'We 
were working on design solutions to fulfil the brief set by Carolyn and 
struggling to achieve something we could make by hand and within budget 
that would enhance Jessica's life and give her something to be proud of.

'We then thought of Trunki and tried to modify one for its new use.

'Magmatic, the design team behind Trunki were very supportive of our work and very kindly donated lots of their products for any future conversions we were able to dream up.

'A product like this, which can give freedom and independence as well as enhance social inclusion, is a great thing.

'This is really important and in our designs we work especially hard to give the children something to be proud of, something to help them say "yes I am different, and yes, I am amazing.'
