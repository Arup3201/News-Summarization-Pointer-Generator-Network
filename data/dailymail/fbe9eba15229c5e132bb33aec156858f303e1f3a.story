Tesco is launching a ‘drive-through’ service to boost sales and try to reverse its first profit fall for nearly two decades.

Shoppers using ‘click and collect’ will buy online and then pick up their purchases from one of 150 designated stores.

Britain’s biggest and richest retailer is also looking to sell some of its vast Extra supermarkets and rent out space in others in an admission it has expanded too far, too fast.

Sales have slumped for the supermarket, despite the investment plan

The moves come as group profits fell 11.6 per cent to £1.66billion for the six months to September compared to last year – the first profit reversal in 18 years.

The chain, which has 3,000 UK outlets, is being hit by a squeeze by rivals as well as cutbacks by shoppers.

However, there was a glimmer of  optimism with the news of a rise in UK sales of 0.1 per cent over the last three months compared to a year ago.

This still lags behind Sainsbury’s, which yesterday revealed a 1.9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for a comparable period.

Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, says 'there is much more to be done' to improve the customer experience

Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke, commenting on the future of the Extra stores, said: ‘We could see disposals – that may happen.

We could downsize them, repurpose them to focus more on food than clothing or rent out space.’ The grocery giant has seen sales in the UK hit a brick wall for the past 18 months.

It has already shrunk some of its retail space by allowing third parties, such as the restaurant chain Nandos, to open in its shops.

Tesco has suffered a squeeze from budget chains like Aldi, Lidl and Iceland on one side and Sainsbury’s and Waitrose on the other.

Consumers struggling in the downturn are also economising in a trend hitting other chains like Asda, Morrisons and the Co-op.

Tesco’s woes come after years of growth when it expanded to every corner of the land.

It overtook Sainsbury’s to become the country’s biggest supermarket in 1995.

Tesco has embarked on a £1billion turnaround plan which includes bombarding homes with money-off vouchers and its new ‘drive-through’ service.

Shoppers will pay a £2 fee for this but it frees them from having to wait in for deliveries and means Tesco does not have to pay for a fleet of vans and drivers.

The chain has also relaunched its cheapest Value range as Everyday Value.

Sales of these budget lines have risen 10 per cent as a result.

Stores are taking on more staff and are being redesigned to offer more fresh food, bakeries and fish counters.

A breakdown of the Tesco figures reveals a 12 per cent slide in trading profit in the UK to £1.1 billion.

International profits, hit by the global financial crisis, fell 17 per cent to £378million.

Mr Clarke said the turnaround plan will cut profits in the short term but will bring long-term rewards. ‘I wouldn’t say we’ve turned a corner, but we’re definitely on the road,’ he added.

The chain's 'turnaround' plan has seen an improvement in UK sales, but has not escaped the imapct of Eurozone and Asian crisis' (posed by models)

Philip Dorgan, analyst at brokers Panmure Gordon, said Tesco’s recovery in the UK was ‘on track’ but would take time.

But
John Ibbotson, director of  retail consultancy Retail Vision, said: 
‘There is little sign the Tesco supertanker is turning round. It has 
thrown a lot of money at the problem and produced only the hollowest of 
victories.’
