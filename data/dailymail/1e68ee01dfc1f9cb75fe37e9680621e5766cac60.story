Once a fit and sporty schoolgirl with a talent for dancing, Loredana Verta’s weight plummeted to less than four stone as she was gripped by anorexia.

After battling the eating disorder for more than three years, her vital organs began to shut down. Eventually she contracted liver disease and died from a heart attack aged 19.

During her tragic descent the aspiring make-up artist kept a diary which  lays bare her self-loathing and weight obsession in page after page of  harrowing entries.

Five years after Loredana's death from a sudden heart attack in 2009, her mother Anna, 55, finally built up the courage to open her daughter's diaries this year. Now she is releasing them to help others

Now, five years after Loredana’s 
death, her mother Anna, a teacher, is releasing the diaries she could 
only bring herself to read for the first time this year, with the aim of
 raising awareness of how deadly anorexia can be.

Mrs
 Verta said yesterday: ‘At the time I couldn’t understand how she’d lost
 control of her own body – why she couldn’t get better, despite all our 
worries and fears for her.

‘But
 now, looking through Lorry’s eyes, I finally understand her battle. I 
want other sufferers to read her diary and recognise themselves in it, 
and know just how deadly anorexia really is.’ One entry in the diary 
reads: ‘Lord, I’ve said it. I NEED HELP. I’m scared I really am. I don’t
 even have the strength to cry. I HATE ME AND MY LIFE. Nothing is going 
right for me. I just wish it would.'

Loredana
 had two sisters – Natalina, 28, and Gabriella, 23, as well as a brother
 Vittorio, 19. Her battle against illness began when she was 16, shortly
 after she joined a dance school.

According
 to her mother, ballet was Loredana’s passion. But Mrs Verta, 55, of 
Hendon, north-west London, said: ‘One day she came home extremely 
anxious. She said the other girls in class were so much thinner than 
her.

‘She was already slim 
and pretty. She loved living and enjoyed meals with the family, and 
there was nothing wrong with the way she looked.

‘I
 insisted she was beautiful the way  she was, but she just shook her 
head. All girls have confidence issues at some point, but I hoped Lorry 
would see sense eventually.’

Loredana began eating tiny portions at mealtimes and tried to conceal the fact her weight was dropping dangerously low.

'I hate me and my life,' Loredana wrote in her diary, revealing her constant battle as anorexia consumed her every thought

'I can't do this anymore, I hate my body,' the teenager wrote consumed and tormented by anorexia

'Mum is so 
lovely. I love her. She is trying so hard with me, but I’m pushing her 
away because I don’t want to gain weight. I need to lose weight - not 
gain it. I just want to be thin.'

'I don’t know how to eat. I don’t know anything. All I want is to be and look boney thin. HELP ME.'

'I can’t do this anymore. I hate my life. I hate my body.'

'I don't feel good, I feel so fat. I get so angry when I think back to when I lost all the weight. I felt so good.'

'I feel so fat, please let me be THIN. I hate my life.I don't want to be fat, please let me be THIN.'

'Why do I have to be fat?'

'I feel crap and I really hate my life, I want to be THIN.'

'There is hardly anyone here, the day is dragging. I look so fat, I've gained so much I can feel it and I look it. I want to DIE.'

'Plz Lord I've said it, I need help, I'm scared. I really am. I don't even have the strength to cry.I HATE ME AND MY LIFE. I just want to be happy and thin. Nothing is going right for me, I just wish it would.'

Mrs Verta said: ‘We’d always been close, but we started arguing every day.

‘I
 tried my best to make her eat by watching her carefully and trying to 
get her to finish her meals, but nothing we did or said worked.’

Loredana
 wrote in the diary: ‘Mum is so lovely. I love her. She is trying so 
hard with me, but I’m pushing her away because I don’t want to gain 
weight. I need to lose weight – not gain it. I just want to be thin.’

In 2005, Loredana was admitted to a specialist treatment centre, weighing less than  four stone.

Mrs
 Verta said: ‘Even though she was so frail, she was terrified of going 
into hospital because she thought she  would ‘‘get fat’’.’

After
 a six-month stay, her weight crept up to eight stone. But the diaries 
she kept during that time reveal a young woman facing daily 
consultations, medical tests and regulated mealtimes who was all the 
while tormented by deep anxiety over food and body image.

One entry reads: ‘I don’t know how to eat. I don’t know anything. All I want is to be and look bony thin.’

Another
 reads: ‘I can’t do this any more. I hate my life. I hate my body.’ Five
 months after being discharged from the treatment centre, she contracted
 a mild chest infection, resulting in her losing a small amount of 
weight – but it was enough to trigger a relapse  into anorexia.

For the next three years she visited various clinics, but the anorexia persisted until her death in 2009.

Mrs Verta said: ‘Loredana had given me so much to live for, and she was gone forever. It wasn’t fair.

Ms Verta said she was inspired to release Loredana's private diaries in the hope reading accounts of her daughter's battle with the illness, will help other sufferers 

After intensive treatment, Loredana, pictured with her mother, did recover her weight to around eight stone, but a chest infection, which caused her to lose weight, sparked a relapse

‘I struggled to comprehend why her desire to be thin had taken over her life in such a cruel way. I cried every day.’

It
 was only this year that  Mrs Verta found the courage to open the diary 
as a way of  gaining understanding about Loredana’s illness.

‘Anorexia occupied her every thought – her entire being,’ Mrs Verta said.

‘I was devastated to read how she felt as if she hated her life and her body.

‘Lorry
 thought she could live with the condition – that as long as she was 
thin, she would be OK. She didn’t realise that anorexia is a deadly 
disease. It is a killer.

‘If her diaries can help other sufferers to understand that, then they would have done some good.’

Ms Verta, backed by her children, Natalina, 28, Gabriella, 23 and Vittorio, 19, said: 'Anorexia occupied her every thought - her entire being. Only by reading her innermost thoughts did I gain that understanding. She didn't realise that anorexia is a deadly disease. It is a killer. If her diaries can help other sufferers to understand that, then they would have done some good'
