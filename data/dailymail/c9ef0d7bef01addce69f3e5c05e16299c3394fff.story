Danny Cipriani's England recall has been confirmed with the rejuvenated Sale fly-half in the national squad flying to New Zealand on Tuesday ahead of the three-Test series against the All Blacks.

The 26-year-old has turned his fortunes around in the last 12 months and recent events have conspired to leave him on course for a first Test appearance since 2008. He has been named in a group of 30 departing for Auckland - with another tranche of players from Northampton and Saracens due to fly out next Monday, after the Aviva Premiership Final.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster will choose his team for the series opener at Eden Park from the initial contingent and Cipriani is one of just two No 10s included, along with Freddie Burns. The man who is joining Leicester from Gloucester this summer is considered to be the prime contender to fill the playmaker's role in the first Test, in the absence of three domestic rivals.

Forwards: Joe Marler, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, Henry Thomas, David Wilson, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Gray, Dave Ward, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Joe Launchbury, Geoff Parling, Ed Slater, James Haskell, Tom Johnson, Matt Kvesic, Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw.

Backs: Danny Care, Ben Youngs, Freddie Burns, Danny Cipriani, Kyle Eastmond, Manu Tuilagi, Henry Trinder, Billy Twelvetrees, Mike Brown, Jonny May, Chris Pennell, Marland Yarde.

'Both Freddie and Danny have great opportunities to put a marker down as genuine international fly-halves,' said Lancaster.

'Owen [Farrell] and Steven Myler have been exceptional this season and they will be considered post these games this weekend. But now it's in Freddie and Danny's court. They've trained great so far so we're looking forward to seeing how they get on.

'Danny has done well, he's come up to speed; he's got to know the plays. He's built relationships with the players and he's been good - it's a similar defensive structure for him to the one at Sale.

'He's excited about being here. We'll make the decision on fly-half on what happens in training and what happens in the next week or so.'

Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler cannot be considered for the opening clash with Steve Hansen's world champions, so soon after the Premiership Final. And George Ford of Bath has been ruled out of the tour, due to the pressing need for an operation on his damaged shoulder. So if Burns is chosen to start, Cipriani is likely to act as the back-up stand-off on the bench, unless Billy Twelvetrees returns to full fitness earlier than expected and can provide cover if required.

'Billy [Twelvetrees] is going well,' said Lancester. 'He hasn't trained yet, and it's unlikely he'll train (on Tuesday) before we fly, but we're optimistic enough to take him on the initial flight with a view to assessing him when we get out there.

'He's really going to have to be training fully at the start of that Test week in order to be considered."But he's certainly made enough progress to be under consideration for the first Test and definitely for the second, so that's why he's on the plane.'

Elsewhere, there are only two scrum-halves in the initial party; Danny Care and Ben Youngs - so the management must hope that neither of them come to any harm in the run-up to the series. Once the club season comes to an end, it appears that Lee Dickson and Richard Wigglesworth will come out as reinforcements in that position.

James Haskell is back in favour, having last played a Test for his country in March last year, when England slumped to a record 30-3 defeat against in Cardiff. The Wasps flanker must have a strong chance of starting the first Test at blindside, in the absence of Northampton's Tom Wood.

There are seven uncapped players in the group; Chris Pennell, Kieran Brookes, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Gray, Dave Ward, Ed Slater and Henry Trinder. Pennell is rewarded for a sensational season for relegated Worcester, while Cowan-Dickie, Ward and Gray will all tussle for the starting hooker place if Rob Webber fails to recover from injury in time - although the Bath player is also included in the squad.

The presence of Pennell is an indication that Bath wing Anthony Watson is destined to miss the trip. The turbo-charged rookie suffered a suspected hamstring injury during Friday's Amlin Challenge Cup Final defeat to Northampton in Cardiff.
