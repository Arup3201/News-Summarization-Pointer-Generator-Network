British backpacker David Miller may have been trying to save Hannah Witheridge as she was being attacked on a Thai beach when the pair were brutally murdered, new evidence suggests. 

The 24-year-old from Jersey was captured on CCTV at around 1am on the night of his death, leading to claims the pair were not in fact together as Thai Police previously claimed. 

Traces of Miss Witheridge's DNA and that of one other person were found on a cigarette butt some 50 yards from where her body was found, suggesting the 23-year-old shared it with her attackers and even had a conversation with them before being killed.

The bodily fluids of two men found during forensic investigation are now thought to belong to Asian men, police revealed. 

The new developments come as police said they were hunting a western woman seen running near the beach in Koh Tao on Sunday. 

Police refer to Westerners as ‘foreigners’ but officers would not comment whether the woman might turn out to be Hannah Witheridge herself, fleeing from the killer or killers who were to soon battered her to death on 
Koh Tao’s idyllic Sairee Beach. 

Thai police inquiries have been branded a 'joke' by locals after investigators mistakenly identified a couple in CCTV footage walking hand-in-hand as the murdered Brits. 

CCTV footage of the woman - who might also turn out to be a terrified witness to the double murders - has yet to be released.

The FBI has been called in to assist , as officials concede they do not have sophisticated enough forensic technology. 

Yesterday bar and restaurant staff were lined up on the beach and had their feet compared to footprints found near where the youngsters' bodies were found last week. 

It comes as General Poompanmoung of Thai Police told MailOnline today that the team were not closing in on any suspects and agreed that he did not know whether the killers were still on the island.

Asked specifically whether they could have already left, he nodded in agreement.

The movements of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller in the hours leading up to their murders added to the mystery of their deaths as it was confirmed that CCTV footage of a couple walking hand in hand - said early to be the Britons - were not them after all.

Thai police have been criticised for leading a chaotic investigation into the deaths of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge in which the line of inquiry has changed several times.

Here, a breakdown of the investigation shows how the frantic hunt for backpackers' killers has unfolded. 

September 15: The semi-naked bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller are discovered between 5am and 6am on Sairee Beach in Koh Tao on September 15. 

A British male, thought to have known the two, was named as a person of interested and hunted by police after allegedly fleeing the island on an early ferry for Bangkok. 

Later, police released CCTV footage which they claimed showed the students walking hand-in-hand down a street. 

It was later revealed the couple in the images were not Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller. 

Images of a migrant worker spotted later on the same CCTV tape are circulated, with police describing the man as a person of interest. 

September 16: DNA samples taken from the scene do not match those of any of a reported 12 suspects. 

Officers claimed they had 'strong evidence' to link six Burmese workers to the gruesome murders, though no forensic links could be made. 

Samples were taken from nine migrant workers and three foreigners including two brothers from Jersey who were friends of David Miller. 

Christopher and James Ware were stopped at Suvarnabhumi International airport on their way back to Britain for questioning. 

The brothers were never arrested. 

September 17: Thai police admit they have 'no idea' who killed David Miller and Hannah Witheridge after failing to link any of 12 suspects to the crime. 

They said it was 'difficult to say' whether the pair's killer or killers was still on the island, and then claimed investigations had pointed them to a group seen on the beach playing the guitar and singing 'western songs'. 

Earlier Thai Prime Minister said it girls wearing bikinis on the holiday island of Koh Tao were not safe unless they were ugly. 

'Can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful?' said General Prayuth Chan-O-Cha in a televised speech. 

He later apologised for his remarks. 

Police later say Miss Witheridge may not have been raped as first suggested following an autopsy on her body. 

September 18: Police claim DNA from two men alongside that of Miss Witheridge has been discovered on a cigarette butt 50 yards from where the 23-year-old's body was found. 

They say traces of at least one man's DNA has been found on Miss Witheridge's body. Later it transpires there is evidence of one man's DNA on the cigarette, and of two men in the victim's body. 

It is suggested David Miller was killed with a blunt piece of metal and not the rusty garden hoe first discovered at the scene and named as a murder weapon. 

Evidence suggests the brave 24-year-old put up a fight before his death and that he was drowned. 

September 19: Thai officials collect DNA samples from workers in bars and restaurants in Koh Tao. 

Lining people along the beach, they measured their feet in order to make a comparison to footprints left in the sand near the murdered Brits' bodies. 

September 20: Investigators now say there is no evidence to suggest Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were together on the day they died, with CCTV footage showing Mr Miller walking alone at around 1am. 

It is claimed Miss Witheridge encountered her attackers, had a conversation with them and may have even shared a cigarette with them before being dragged to her death. 

There is a suggestion Mr Miller was coming to her aid when he was also killed. 

A CCTV video of a woman running near the scene is described but not released. Police say it could be of a witness to the double murder, a suspect or of Miss Witheridge herself. 

The FBI is called in to help analyse forensic evidence as the hunt for the pair's killers goes in to its sixth day. 

Thai police efforts are blasted a 'joke' by residents. 

New CCTV footage has emerged of Mr 
Miller walking alone along the restaurant and club strip in the early 
hours of Monday.

The first clip was recorded as 1.27am, while the 
second, in which he is seen walking in the opposite direction – towards 
what would become the scene of his death – was captured at 1.56am.

Where
 both he and Miss Witheridge were in the intervening half an hour 
remains a mystery.

Divers were among officers continuing 
the search for a second weapon yesterday. One was seen waist-deep in the
 water drawing up sand with a rake.

Police believe the killers used a garden
 hoe – which has been found – to batter Miss Witheridge and a ‘metal 
weapon’ to bludgeon Mr Miller. 

The evidence of a second weapon has left 
police with what one officer today described as ‘unquestioned proof’ 
that at least two killers were involved.

But one expatriate was critical of the 
Thai police, who have been criticised for the haphazard nature of the 
investigation. 

‘All this activity leaves you with a feeling that this is
 too little, too late,’ said the businessman, who declined to be named. 

‘Surely anything of any use would have been washed away or stomped on by
 now.’ 

The General replied with mixed answers when asked specifically whether post mortem examinations on the bodies had revealed the presence of drugs.

At first he said no, then he said he did not know and when pressed one of his aides said such questions should not be asked ‘out of respect for the victims and the families’.

Earlier it was claimed it was possible the Britons had either walked past their killers, who were lurking in the shadows between the lights of late-night waterside bars, or they were followed and attacked when they were on the beach beside boulders close to their holiday bungalows.

As divers searched for the weapon, police finally conceded they were finding the double-murder 'quite difficult'

An autopsy showed that Mr Miller had been struck with a metal bar, rather than the garden hoe used to strike Miss Witheridge

Tourists take pictures at Sairee beach spot where Mr Miller and Hannah Witheridge were killed on Monday

Tourists continued to arrive at the island today where local businesses are hopeful the double murder doesn't ruin the islands reputation                                                               

Relatives of the pair arrived in Bangkok on Thursday as police struggle to examine forensic evidence due to lack of technology

Thailand's prime minister today apologised for suggesting tourists in bikinis made themselves more vulnerable - comments which provoked outrage around the world.

In an extraordinary outburst yesterday, General Prayuth Chan-O-Cha (right) suggested that only ugly tourists were safe when wearing beach wear.

His remark appeared to blame murdered Briton Hannah Witheridge for exposing herself to a brutal attack on the paradise island of Koh Tao.

In a speech broadcast live on Thai TV yesterday, he said: ‘There are always problems with tourist safety.

‘They think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want, they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere. Can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful?’

He was last night accused of smearing a murdered British backpacker to protect his country’s tourism industry.

Andrew Rosindell, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: 'What is most worrying about these comments is the underlying implication about those who have been murdered that they have somehow brought it upon themselves.'

In a hastily convened press conference in Bangkok today, Prayut said: 'I'm sorry that it hurt people.

'I didn't intend to insult or criticise anyone. I just warned that sometimes people have to be careful... today Thailand is safe except there are some bad guys - like anywhere in the world.'
