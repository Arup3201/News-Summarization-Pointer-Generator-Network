Scott Humphrey repeatedly punched Richard Rovetto after the pair had an argument in a taxi on the way home from a stag do in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.

The fight broke out when Humphrey, 27, accused Mr Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend, saying that he had 'poked' her on Facebook.

Nottingham Crown Court heard that Humphrey asked the father-of-one: 'If you're such a good friend why did you poke my missus?'

Sending someone a virtual 'poke' on the social networking site is often seen as a way of flirting with them.

Prosecutor Gareth Gimson told the hearing that the argument came to a head as the taxi stopped in Top Valley, Nottingham.

He said Humphrey struck 29-year-old Mr Rovetto, causing him to bleed from the nose, before delivering another blow which knocked his friend to floor and caused him to bang his head on the pavement.

Mr Rovetto, of Arnold, Nottingham, suffered severe head injuries and died in hospital hours later. Humphrey fled the scene but later handed himself in to police.

The court heard that the friends had enjoyed a stag do in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire before falling out.

Mr Gimson said: 'The taxi driver recalls Scott Humphrey accusing Richard Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend in the past and doing so via Facebook. The expression used is a "poke". 

'Scott Humphrey said to Richard Rovetto, "If you're such a good friend then why did you poke my missus?"

'Richard Rovetto said he didn't know it was his girlfriend. The exchange became more heated.'

Humphrey, from Nottingham, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for four years and four months.

Judge Gregory Dickinson QC, sentencing, told him: 'When you and him went out that evening, violence and death were the furthest things from your mind.

'You didn't intend to kill him. Part of the tragedy is that it's left to chance what happens. 

'There will be a fight like this somewhere tonight and the person will get up and go home and the police will never hear about it.'

Robert Egbuna, defending, said: 'The defendant is genuinely remorseful about his actions. He will never forget that day. 

'As soon as Scott Humphrey heard about what had happened to Richard Rovetto, he was devastated. He has been very candid and admitted this offence from the very start.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Rovetto's brother-in-law Jason Burley-Evans, 42, said: 'This was a waste of a life. We feel the sentence wasn't the justice we wanted for Richard. He was a much-loved person and it will be hard for us all to move on.'
