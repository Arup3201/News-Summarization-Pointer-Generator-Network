Cliff Richard spoke of his agony last night at ‘absurd and untrue allegations’ as police investigate child abuse claims from two more alleged victims.

The pop star is now accused of sexually assaulting a total of three victims in the UK and abroad, it can be revealed.

Last night the 74-year-old released a statement saying he hoped ‘the truth will prevail’ after a letter from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton revealed the police investigation has ‘increased significantly in size’ and officers were dealing with ‘more than one allegation’.

The police investigation into veteran singer Sir Cliff Richard has 'increased significantly in size' since its inception and involves 'more than one allegation', police say

In his letter to MP Keith Vaz, David Crompton, South Yorkshire Police chief constable (pictured), said he was unable to give a date when the investigation into the singer would conclude

Distraught, Sir Cliff said he had no idea who his accusers were and hit out at police for refusing to disclose details to him.

He said: ‘I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me.

‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so.

‘Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon.

‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’

Two new alleged victims have come forward since the singer’s £3million Berkshire home was raided last August by detectives investigating a historic allegation of sexual assault on a teenage boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985.

South Yorkshire Police has set up a dedicated team of officers, under the name Operation Kaddie, to investigate allegations that three boys were molested.

Detectives have already taken statements from a number of witnesses as the probe widens.

Prosecutors are also liaising with police to give ‘investigative advice’ on how to take the investigation forward after officers received a significant number of new lines of inquiry.

The devastating blow for the singer, who had hoped to be cleared very shortly, emerged after the force faced blistering criticism for a secret deal with the BBC to film a raid on his house.

Last night chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz took the unusual step of releasing a letter from Mr Crompton confirming the investigation had been stepped up in light of the new information, and he claimed Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been constantly updated.

Mr Crompton wrote: ‘South Yorkshire Police detectives are in very regular contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers. Typically this involves a verbal update about once a fortnight.

‘We have not written directly to Sir Cliff Richard. It is the responsibility of his lawyers to ensure he is fully briefed on the conversations which have taken place with investigators.

‘This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation.’

Cliff Richard yesterday issued this statement: ‘I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me.

‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so. Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon.

‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’ 

The star was on holiday in Portugal when detectives swooped on his penthouse suite in Sunningdale without warning on August 14 in a blaze of publicity as the BBC beamed live television images of detectives rifling through his belongings during a five-hour raid.

He flew back to the UK to be quizzed by detectives on August 24. The force released a statement at the time saying the singer had entered one of their stations voluntarily: ‘A 73-year-old man has spoken us in relation to an allegation of a sexual nature dating back to 1985. The man was interviewed under caution but was not arrested.’

The police investigation first began last year when a man, now in his 40s, came forward to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him at a rally in Sheffield held by American evangelist Billy Graham. He initially contacted Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation set up in October 2012 to examine claims against Savile and other celebrities. The report was passed to South Yorkshire Police last year.

Police have already been heavily criticised over the way the case against the singer has unfolded.

The raid was recorded live by a BBC helicopter circling overhead capturing officers wearing forensic gloves searching through drawers after a reporter contacted the force claiming they had information about the investigation.

BBC journalists were given 18 hours’ notice of the raid, an aerial photograph of the singer’s apartment and even details of which gate the police would use.

On Tuesday the Mail revealed a damning report by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter had blasted police for confirming details of a ‘highly sensitive and confidential’ investigation to the BBC.

A Metropolitan Police investigation into the leak to the BBC has been unable to find the source.

A day on from the controversial raid, South Yorkshire Police said it had received a number of calls with information. Sir Cliff has now vowed to sell his Berkshire home, telling friends he feels like he has been ‘ransacked by burglars’.
