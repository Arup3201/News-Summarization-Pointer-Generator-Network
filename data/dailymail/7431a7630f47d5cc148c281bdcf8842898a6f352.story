David Luiz has revealed Zlatan Ibrahimovic played a major role in his decision to leave Chelsea for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer.

Luiz decided to end his stay in west London by sealing an incredible £50million move to the French capital.

The chance to link up with fellow Brazilians Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Maxwell and Lucas may have had a significant bearing on his decision to join PSG - but it was Ibrahimovic who asked him to join the Ligue 1 side.

Luiz, who is set to face former side Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, said: ‘There are two Zlatans: one the media portray and then the real one.

‘He was one of the big reasons that I chose to join Paris. When Chelsea played Paris he said to me during the game, you need to come and play with us next season.

'He is one of the best players in the world, and a great guy. Of course Mourinho knows him well from Inter and will have a plan to try and stop him, but when Zlatan is on form he is unstoppable.’
