Footage of a four-year-old boy firing a gun into the air has caused outrage in Mexico after video showing him firing wildly in the middle of the street was posted online.

While Mexican laws allow residents to keep guns within their own homes, the boy can be seen firing the pistol repeatedly above his head while several adults stand around apparently unconcerned.

Despite the fact that the gun recoils after each bullet, he is clearly well versed in using it and fires off several rounds.

The video caused outrage across Mexico after it was posted online and went viral

Police are now being urged to investigate both the child and the adults who appear in the video

The video has now gone viral with authorities being urged to track down the boy and adults, and take legal action.

It is a common misconception that guns are illegal in Mexico but ownership is strictly controlled, with only licensed firearms allowed to be kept at home for reasons of personal protection.

A police spokesman confirmed to local media that a child standing in the middle of the street firing a gun indiscriminately into the air was definitely not legal under any circumstances.

He said: 'We have heard about the case including the allegation that happened in Mexico, but at the moment we have no more details.'

He added that if anybody knew any more details including the location and the names of the three adults who also appeared in the video then they should contact police and pass it on.

The video shocked many in a country that is used to gun violence.

And another, Alfredo Taquillo, said: 'I guess in a few years when he has killed somebody his parents will say he must have got in with bad company.'
