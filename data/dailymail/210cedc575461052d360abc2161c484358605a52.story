It has long been thought that, broadly speaking, there are two types of planet in the universe - terrestrial, rocky worlds like Earth, and gas giants like Neptune.

But now remarkable research has, for the first time, suggested that some gas giants can transform into rocky worlds later in their lives - and it may even be possible for them to become habitable.

If true, it would suggest our theories of habitable planet formation may need to be rewritten, and life may have even more of a chance of forming in the universe than we thought.

Researchers at the University of Washington studied mini-Neptunes. They say some of the planets can migrate closer to their host star and become habitable (illustration shown). Moving closer would subject them to more X-rays and radiation, in turn ejecting their gaseous atmosphere into space

The research was carried out by University of Washington doctoral student Rodrigo Luger and research assistant professor Dr Rory Barnes.

They focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a mini-Neptune, similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times Earth's mass.

In particular, they considered those around M Dwarfs - stars which are smaller and dimmer than the sun, with close-in habitable zones.

Earlier this week scientists revealed a solar system with five Earth-sized planets has been discovered, which is so ancient it was born not long after the dawn of time.

The system's parent star, named Kepler-444, is 117 light years from Earth and 11.2 billion years old.

When the sun-like star was formed out of a primordial cloud of gas and dust, the universe was just a fifth of its current age. 

Astronomers have shown that it hosts five planets with diameters ranging between those of Mercury and Venus. That makes them roughly the same size, or slightly smaller than Earth.

‘We now know that Earth-sized planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy,’ said Dr Tiago Campante, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy.

Astronomers expect to find many Earth-like and 'super-Earth' planets in the habitable zones of these stars in coming years, so it’s important to know if they might indeed support life.

In these systems, mini-Neptunes often form far from their host star, with ice molecules joining with hydrogen and helium gases in great quantities to form icy, rocky cores surrounded by massive gaseous atmospheres.

'They are initially freezing cold, inhospitable worlds,' Mr Luger said. 'But planets need not always remain in place.'

The researchers say that tidal forces from the planet's star could cause the planet to migrate closer to the centre of its planetary system.

In the process, this can bring mini-Neptunes into their host star's habitable zone, where they are exposed to much higher levels of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation.

What follows is a rapid loss of the atmospheric gases to space, possibly leaving behind a hydrogen-free, rocky world.

The co-authors call such planets 'habitable evaporated cores.'

'Such a planet is likely to have abundant surface water, since its core is rich in water ice,' Mr Luger said.

He added that 'once in the habitable zone, this ice can melt and form oceans,' perhaps leading to the formation of life.

Shown here is an illustration of the gas giants in the solar system. They are all thought to have a core of rock and ice at their centres. If the surrounding atmosphere was ejected, like in the mini-Neptune scenario described in this latest research, it could leave behind a terrestrial, habitable world

The research focused on a particular type of gas giant known as a mini-Neptune, a type of planet that is similar to other gas giants but only about 10 times Earth's mass. It's unknown if the resultant planet would be like Earth, left, or a super-Earth, illustrated right

Dr Barnes and Mr Luger note that many other conditions would have to be met for such planets to be habitable.

One is the development of an atmosphere right for creating and recycling nutrients globally.

Another is simple timing. If hydrogen and helium loss is too slow while a planet is forming, a gaseous envelope would prevail and a rocky, terrestrial world may not form.

If the world loses hydrogen too quickly, a runaway greenhouse state could result, with all water lost to space.

'The bottom line is that this process - the transformation of a mini-Neptune into an Earthlike world - could be a pathway to the formation of habitable worlds around M dwarf stars,' Mr Luger said.

Will they truly be habitable? That remains for future research to learn, Mr Luger added.

Most of the planets outside our solar system discovered to data have been found by Nasa's Kepler telescope, illustrated here. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets, and was recently repurposed for the new 'K2' mission after one of its reaction wheels failed
