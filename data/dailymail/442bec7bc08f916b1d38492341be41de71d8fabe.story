 When Kenny Lovelace took Molly Ryan to Coors Field to see the Colorado Rockies play the Arizona Diamondbacks last week, he had a diamond ring in his back pocket and a big plan.

Lovelace had already informed Ryan's parents that he planned on asking Molly to be his wife and that he was going to project the romantic question on the stadium's jumbotron.

Lovelace, the entire Ryan family, and secretly hired wedding photographer Kerinsa Mullins, made their way to the stadium for an unforgettable and comedic night.

But their camera ready moment was ruined when a disgruntled old woman watching the game made her feelings known by flipping the bird to the camera.

The couple enjoyed a romantic evening despite being flipped off by the old lady in some of the photographs taken by Kerinsa Mullins: www.kerinsamarie.com

Molly Ryan knew that Lovelace was going to propose to her at some point but didn't know exactly when. According to coverage from WTOP, hours earlier at a taco bell, Molly picked up a hot sauce packet that read, 'will you marry me?' She reportedly threw the hot sauce packet at Lovelace and said, 'See? even Taco Bell thinks you should marry me.'

When the family arrived at the game, everything was set for the jumbo plan. Kerinsa Mullins and her husband were standing a few rows away from the family ready to snap of photo of Lovelace and Ryan the moment he popped the question.

Not Planned was the fact that the photographer was going to be seated near an older couple who wanted to watch the game and nothing but the game.

As soon as the jumbotron flashed, 'Will you marry me, Molly?' the photographer stood up to take a photo of the proposal and the grouchy older couple yelled at her to sit down.

Upon taking the photograph, Mullins explained to the elderly couple that she was only standing monetarily to photograph the proposal.

Lovelace dropped to his knee. Molly Ryan said, 'Yes!' and the crowd cheered.

'He got down on one knee and that's when I realized it was me and I just started crying and it was a great moment,' Ryan says.

The older woman seated near Mullins was none too pleased. Another person who was with the older couple even called over a security guard because she couldn't return to her seat. Mullins received glares.

'They kept yelling at me and I just ignored them because I was there to do a job and I did not want to miss something that would be so brief and so important,' Mullins says.

Once the security guard came over to Mullins, she moved out of the unhappy trio's way.

It wasn't until the next day that Mullins found an unwanted surprise in an otherwise romantic photograph of Lovelace and Ryan.

'in about 20 of them, she and her friend are giving me the stink eye,' Mullins says.

In one of the photos the older woman is pictured flipping her middle finger at the camera.

Mullins was worried the couple might be disappointed at first, but Ryan was extremely amused.

'I couldn't stop laughing. I said it was the greatest photo I've ever seen...There is a girl sitting behind us that is so excited for us. My mom is crying, I'm crying, and Ken's nervous and then there's this lady flipping us off,' says Ryan.

Ryan Joked about making the photo a 'save the date' magnet for friends and family. While some friends were sad for Ryan that the old woman may have ruined her special moment, Ryan maintained her sense of humor and poise.

Ryan is quoted as saying that is she finds out the identity of the curmudgeon she'd like to, 'make her famous.'She has even offered to invite the old lady to the wedding.

'I would love for her to appear in one of my pictures at the wedding. That would be terrific,' Ryan says.  

The photo of the woman flipping off her finger is now Molly Ryan's profile photo on facebook. The Old woman has yet to reveal her mysterious identity.
