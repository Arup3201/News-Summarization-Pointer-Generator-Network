Four British banks have been told to hand over £1.4billion by Singapore’s central bank for trying to rig key interest rates in the Asian financial hub.

In an echo of the Libor scandal that rocked the City of London last year, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were among 20 banks disciplined yesterday after 133 traders tried to manipulate the benchmark rates at which banks lend to each other.

Three quarters of the bankers have resigned or been sacked, while others have faced disciplinary action including ‘forfeiture of bonuses’, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.

The affair follows a string of embarrassing revelations about British banks that began last year. Barclays was fined £290million after its traders rigged the key Libor interest rate in London, while RBS coughed up £390million.

HSBC was fined £1.2billion in the US for failing to prevent its branches being used by drug barons and terrorist groups to launder money. The latest controversy saw Singapore’s equivalent of the Bank of England punish every major British lender except Lloyds.

The £1.4billion handed over by the four banks will be added to the ¿statutory reserve¿ pot that foreign banks are asked to deposit in countries where they operate

The £1.4billion handed over by the four banks will be added to the ‘statutory reserve’ pot that foreign banks are asked to deposit in countries where they operate, as a buffer against losses that might affect the local economy.

The man passed over for the top job at the Bank of England will step down later this year. Deputy governor Paul Tucker will leave with a pension pot of more than £5.7million, paying the equivalent of a £157,500 annual salary.
