The Utah mother who claims her otherwise healthy teenage son died because of side-effects from a flu-shot has revealed her boy pleaded with doctor's to save him before he lapsed into a coma.

As she made the difficult decision to release heartbreaking pictures of her son, Chandler, 19, languishing in his hospital bed, Lori Webb described how scared he became as his health rapidly deteriorated following his routine vaccination on October 15th.

Suffering violent episodes of vomiting and debilitating headaches, Chandler's condition worsened in the week after the shot until he was placed on life-support at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, begging, 'Doctor's, save me.'

Coma: Chandler Webb, 19, lies in his hospital bed in Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah - from which he never awoke and passed away on Tuesday - just five weeks after he was given a flu-shot

Sports loving Chandler, was given his first ever shot last month after agreeing to travel on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

However, the day after receiving the flu and tuberculosis shots, the Brighton High School graduate began suffering severe vomiting and was eventually admitted to hospital in Murray where he fell into a coma after a week of unexplained illness.

Despite doctor's best efforts they could not diagnose him, despite putting him through a battery of tests.

Officially Chandler's direct cause of death was swelling of the brain, but speaking to Fox News, Lori explained that she believes the vaccination was the reason - and that doctors should have asked sooner if her son had recently been given a shot.

'What attacked his brain happened so quickly within 15 hours,' Webb said on Fox and Friends. 

'From one CT scan to the next, there was so much pressure and swelling on the brain that it crushed his brain stem.'

Chandler was ultimately taken off life support after a month in a coma and he died on Tuesday after 28 days in the hospital.

'He was sicker than he has ever been in his life. He says he's never shook so hard his whole life. He had the worst headache, threw up, and he slept for about two and a half days and didn't eat anything during that time,' said Webb to the Salt Lake Tribune.

According to a report from the Salt Lake Tribune, Webb has declined an autopsy, as she believes that a pending brain biopsy will reveal Chandler’s cause of death.

Chandler's doctors have not discussed his case and public health officials repeated that the vaccine is safe and rarely has serious side effects.

Chandler's medical team, which included six neurologists at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, tested him for every conceivable illness - including Lyme disease and sexually transmitted ones.

'They checked every virus, every fungus, ever tick, west Nile they even checked for rabies,' said Lori.  'And they can't find anything...it was the most senseless, senseless, death.'

'This was his first flu shot,' Lori said. 'He’d never had one before.'

'I hate this. 'I hate that I have to bury my son.'

Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said the state is aware of the case but can’t verify the cause of death nor whether it is investigating because of patient confidentiality.

He added that the health department has no record of anyone in Utah dying from a reaction to the vaccine, he said.

'Like with other medical procedures, there can be side effects and adverse reactions,' he said.

'In the vast majority of those cases the side effects are not very severe — soreness at the injection site, low fever, achiness. Occasionally, yes, there are more severe side effects from receiving the vaccine.'

130 million people nationwide, nearly half of all Americans, decide to get the flu vaccine every year and side effects are extremely rare.

Out of those 130 million people, about 140 people report serious side-effects each year.

Chandler Webb was described as a healthy teen, who visited the gym five days a week before he fell ill.

Lori Webb described how as her son was taken off life-support she cut his hair for the last time and told him the story of 'The Three Billy Goats Gruff', just as she did when he was a child.

'I can’t describe how hard it is to lose a child,' she said.

'We can’t wrap our heads around this… it’s so bizarre.'
