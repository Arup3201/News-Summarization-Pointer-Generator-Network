Jailed: Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was ordered to return to prison by the Supreme Court today and complete a reduced sentence for gun charges

Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt has been ordered to return to prison to complete a five year sentence for possessing a guns given to him by one of the masterminds behind the 1993 terror attacks in Mumbai.

Dutt acquired the AK-46 automatic rifle and a handgun from Abu Salem, who was convicted for his role in the 13 bomb blasts in 1993, which killed 257 people.

The actor had been jailed in 2005 for six years for the gun charges - although he was cleared of terror offences - but only served 18 months before being released in 2007 on bail.

But the Supreme Court today ruled that the charges were too severe for bail and ordered Dutt to return to jail within four weeks to complete the remaining three-and-a-half years of a reduced five year term.

The 53-year-old is considered Bollywood royalty and the film industry is thought to have invested more than £30 million in upcoming movies with him in the starring role.

His career began when he was a child, the son of one of India's mots popular acting couples, Sunil and Nargis.

Dutt regularly played policemen and gangsters, and his portrayal of a gangster in Lage Raho Munna Bhai cemented his place as a Bollywood star.

The blasts were thought to have been carried out in revenge for the death of Muslims in communal riots be in 1992. Dutt's defence team had argued that he got hold of the weapon to protect his Muslim mother.

His MP sister, Priya, was in court to hear the ruling and was visibly upset. Dutt's lawyer said the actor will 'abide' by the order.

The court also considered the sentences of several others convicted following the bomb attack and reduced the death penalty for 10 defendants to life sentences.

It also confirmed the death sentence given to Yakub Memon, brother of 'Tiger' Memon, who is suspected to be one of the masterminds behind the bombings.

Vani Tripathi, national secretary of the Hindu nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, who performed alongside Dutt in the 1998 film Dushman, told The Telegraph she was sadden by the ruling but that there should be no exceptions for celebrities. 

She saddened: 'I have seen how Sanjay Dutt bounced back to life after those rough years.

'The decision has come from the highest court of the land leaving little scope for any doubt about the process. I am saddened and shocked but law is blind in terms of status and emotions. This is rule of the law and it has taken its course.'
