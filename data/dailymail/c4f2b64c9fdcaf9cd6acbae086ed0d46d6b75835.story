OFSTED inspectors who grilled pupils on 'British values' have been accused of asking a young girl at a Christian school whether she was a virgin.

The pupil, aged around 12, was allegedly asked the invasive question when inspectors visited Durham Free School.

The extraordinary claim emerged as MPs questioned Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, who flatly denied the allegation.

He told the education select committee he had conducted a 'thorough' investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false. 

Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw defended the way inspections are carried out to check that schools are teaching 'British values'

Ariella Wilkinson, 10, says she came home in tears after being questioned by Ofsted inspectors about lesbians. Her mother Lena said the questioning was 'completely inappropriate'

But last night the chairman of Durham Free School's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously, saying: 'There is something in it.'

John Denning added that it was 'clearly the case that inspectors are asking questions that most people would think of as inappropriate for the age'.

And he accused Sir Michael of making himself 'a hostage to fortune' by denying there was a problem.

Parents branded the Chief Inspector 'condescending' and complained he had not spoken to them or taken their concerns seriously.

Durham Free School is set to close after inspectors branded children 'intolerant' in a disastrous Ofsted report which also pointed out failures in teaching and attainment.

Parents say their children, aged 11 to 13, were asked 'inappropriate' questions about gay people, Muslims and sex. Some pupils were allegedly asked whether there were any gay children in their class. 

It is one of a number of schools who say they are falling victim to the Government's new British Values drive, which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles.

Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has been put in special measures after children were branded intolerant.

Labour MP Alex Cunningham warned that some of the parents claim that Ofsted has 'got it in for Christian schools'

Yesterday, Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said he had been 'inundated' with emails and letters from parents at Durham Free School. 

He suggested families felt there was a political agenda and that 'Ofsted had got it in for Christian schools'.

'Some parents claim that there were some inappropriate approaches to the inspection,' he said. 

'A Member of Parliament said to me last night that one parent had claimed that a girl was even asked if she was a virgin. Is that something you would investigate?'

Sir Michael replied: 'We have investigated those allegations and those allegations are false. We've spent a long time looking at this.'

But he did admit that inspectors may ask children whether they call each other 'gay' or 'lesbo'.

Sir Michael replied: 'I can't imagine an inspector asking those sorts of questions. If any inspector behaved inappropriately they would be dealt with very severely by Ofsted.' 

The chairman of Durham Free School's board of governors indicated that it was taking the allegation involving the young girl seriously, saying: 'There is something in it'

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has insisted students should be taught about values such as tolerance, respect, democracy and the rule of law regardless of faith or cultural alignment

Yesterday, parents at both schools denied there was homophobic bullying and called for Sir Michael to investigate their complaints properly.

Dr Tim Dunnett, 36, who has four children at Grindon Hall, said: 'We feel that Ofsted's response to our concerns is patronising.

'Michael Wilshaw is adamant he has made a full investigation, but how can this be when he has not spoken to any of the staff or parents involved and addressed our concerns?' 

Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: 'Parents are disappointed Ofsted has not taken their allegations seriously.'

Last summer, the Government announced all schools will be required to teach British values following the Trojan Horse controversy over Islamist attempts to infiltrate schools. 

The drive has been backed by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, dubbed Ms U-Turn.

Dozens of primary school pupils a year are suspended for being drunk or high on drugs, figures reveal.

Every week in term time at least one exclusion order is imposed on an under-11 for offences including alcohol abuse or drug dealing.

At secondary school the situation is worse still, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that teachers are losing the battle against substance abuse.

Figures released in Parliament this week show that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs. 

The Department for Education said this included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse.

There are 39 weeks in the average term, meaning one pupil aged five-11 is suspended every week.

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: 'The striking thing is that 40 primary school children have been excluded because they turned up drunk or high.

'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence.

'We do have to ask what is happening to the parents of these children and are they being prosecuted. Clearly they are getting the drugs and alcohol from somewhere.'

The figures show that there were 6,590 drink and drug related fixed period suspensions in secondary schools in 2012-13, the latest year for which figures are available.

Another 360 exclusions were imposed, where students were removed from the school permanently, accounting for one in ten of all expulsions.

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Prohibited items including alcohol and drugs have no place whatsoever in the classroom. 

'We have introduced a range of powers for teachers to ensure discipline, behaviour and safety are maintained. 

'Our guidance on behaviour clarifies what head teachers can do to properly discipline disruptive pupils and frees up teachers' time and energy.'
