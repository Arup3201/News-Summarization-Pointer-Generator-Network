She has been putting on a brave face since her split from husband Tom Cruise last week.

But despite her smiling exterior the strain of Katie Holmes' break-up is showing itself in other ways - most notably her rail-thin body.

The actress failed to hide her shrinking frame when she spent the day with her child by the Mission Impossible actor, Suri, six.

Taking its toll? Katie Holmes put on a brave face yesterday as she showed off her rail-thin figure while carrying daughter Suri in New York after splitting from Tom Cruise

Loose fit: Katie's halter-neck top was hanging off her - and she didn't appear to be in need of a bra

The 33-year-old's blue and orange 
halterneck top clearly displayed her bony back and angular collarbone 
and her blue jeans seemed to hang off her.

Her outing came as Tom's lawyer lashed out at Katie and her legal team, accusing them of 'playing the media'.

High profile lawyer Bert
 Fields spoke to BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. He would not be drawn on 
specific details of the divorce - but did stick the knife in and 
insisted Tom was 'really sad about what's happening'.

While Katie attempted a steely 
resolve today, Suri Cruise looked tired and strained by the emotional 
custody battle her parents are to embark on.

The six-year-old is currently dealing with the news that her parents are set for a high-profile divorce.

Katie held her daughter tenderly in her arms during a trip with friends - and of course security - to the Children's Museum of the Arts in the Soho area of New York City.

Little Suri, dressed in a pink dress and holding onto a cuddly toy, clung to her actress mother.

Yesterday, Katie - who filed for divorce from the Hollywood
 star last week - spent American holiday Independence Day as a single 
mother for the first time.

The Dawson's Creek beauty was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment stocking up on food supplies.

Making her way to the store, dressed 
casually in a denim shirt and a floral summery skirt, the mother-of-one 
looked feminine and pretty as she skipped along with Suri, who was in 
the same multi-coloured poppy dress she was in the night before.

Inside
 the market, Suri rode in the front of the shopping cart playing with a 
pale pink cowboy hat, with Katie photographing her wearing it.

The mother and daughter duo were accompanied by one of Katie's bodyguards from her top heavy security team.

During the outing Katie reassured fans that she is coping following the split from the Hollywood star.

Approached as she stocked up on food, Katie told a New York Daily News reporter: 'I'm alright. Thank you.'

Meanwhile
 it emerged that Katie Holmes is set to show her label Holmes & Yang at New York Fashion Week this September for the first time.

A spokesperson for Katie told WWD that her personal life would not impact her fashion label, despite her high-profile split from Tom Cruise last week.

Protected: Katie was flanked by a burly security guard

The newly-single 33-year-old actress 
co-designs the label, which launched in 2009, with her stylist and 
long-time friend Jeanne Yang.

Available at Barneys New York, Holmes
 & Yang specialise in wearable day-to-night pieces and luxury basics
 that are all manufactured in the U.S.

Katie told the New York Times: 'We 
know that women are on the go and do a lot of different sorts of things 
all in one day. Hopefully, [Holmes & Yang] helps to provide them 
with some confidence in attacking all those different roles.'

Ms Yang added: 'We wanted to make pieces that you could bend over and pick up your kid in and also look really elegant.

Helping hand: Suri was guided along by her mother, who tenderly placed an arm on each of her daughter's shoulders

Tea time: Katie and Suri also had a meal at Alice's tea cup during their girly day out together

'Just comfortable clothes that you can wear going from a meeting to being a mom to going on a date.'

Mission accomplished. Season after 
season, Holmes & Yang creates a base palette of cream, navy, and 
black, featuring luxe shirts and trousers; textured silk jumpsuits; 
motorcycle jackets; leather, silk-lined blazers; and dresses worthy of 
the red carpet.

Showing their spring collection in 
New York for the first time with an intimate presentation, instead of a 
runway show, will firmly put Katie back on the high-fashion map.

Since her marriage to Tom Cruise in 
2006, and her first foray into couture the same year with Victoria 
Beckham, the golden girl of Dawson's Creek has kept a low profile within
 the fashion industry.

However after she made the decision 
to file divorce papers last Friday, Katie is set to step out of Tom's 
Scientology shadow and back into the spotlight.

Moving on: Katie Holmes was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment yesterday, stocking up on supplies 

The
 50-year-old actor was said to be 'blindsided' when his wife filed for 
divorce from him last week after five years of marriage and sought legal
 custody of their child - intends to go to court in Los Angeles in 
person to ensure he is legally allowed to see the youngster.

Katie filed for the divorce in New 
York because she believes she has a better chance of winning custody, 
and although Tom was encouraged to file in California, the law states divorce cannot be filed in separate states at the same time.

A
 source said: 'Tom has told Dennis Wasser and Bert Fields, his long-time
 entertainment lawyer, that his first priority is getting a court order 
in place, obviously a temporary one, that will allow him to legally see 
his daughter.

'Team Cruise 
has extensive documentation to prove that Los Angeles is where the case 
should proceed, because this is where he says they have lived.

The way they were: Katie announced that she was splitting with her husband of six years last Friday

Hints: In next month's ELLE magazine Katie hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time

'Tom is extremely disappointed that Katie filed in New York, and he feels that she is trying to cut him out of their daughter's life.

'Tom won't tolerate it and told his lawyers that if he personally needs to go to court and make a plea in front of the judge for an order allowing him to see his daughter, he will.'

It is believed Katie wants legal custody because she is worried about Tom's devotion to sci-fi cult Scientology and the effect the quasi-religious sect may have on their six-year-old daughter.

However a source told TMZ: '[Katie] was totally committed to Scientology. She had enthusiasm for it and would voluntarily and gladly participate in it when Tom was off shooting movies.

'This is not a fight over religion. It's being used as a way to hurt Tom.'

Meanwhile, an interview with Katie from next month's ELLE magazine hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time.

Discussing turning 33, she told the US publication: 'I definitely feel much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel sexier. I'm staring to come into my own. It's like a new phase.'

Asked about her marriage, she admitted she wanted to focus on herself.

She said: 'He has been Tom Cruise for 30 years. I know who I am and where I am and where I want to go, so I want to focus on that.'
