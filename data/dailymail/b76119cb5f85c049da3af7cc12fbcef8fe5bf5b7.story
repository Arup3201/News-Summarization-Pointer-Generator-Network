A three-year-old boy has been banned from taking part in his first ever school photograph - after his headteacher ruled his haircut wastoo short.

Delaney Templeton had been excitedly looking forward to having the picture taken with his classmates at his nursery.

But when mother Julieann Yates, 28, arrived to collect him from school later that day the youngster said he had not been allowed to be in the picture and instead had to sit out and watch.

Furious, she immediately went to see the head, who said Delaney's hair broke school rules and was 'extreme' as it had been cut too short.

Three-year-old Delaney Templeton, from Sunderland, who was banned from taking part in his first school photograph because his head teacher deemed his hairstyle to be 'extreme'

Julieann Yates, 28, said she was 'absolutely furious' that her son wasn't allowed to be pictured

'I was absolutely furious,' said Julieann, who lives in Marley Pots, Sunderland.

'I was really, really mad. We were really looking forward to having his picture taken with the other children and he was talking about it on the way to nursery that morning.

'It would have been his first ever school photos. I was very, very upset and angry.

'Most of the school had their photos taken.'

She added: 'My son was refused because of his hairstyle.

'He has had the exact same hairstyle since he started nursery in September and the school has never said it was inappropriate.

The school has defended its decision to exclude the boy from the picture

'He was the only one in his year who was excluded, but there were a lot of children in the school, with comb overs, who had their photos taken.'

Delaney, who attends Southwick Community Primary School, has been left upset and he and his family have been denied his first ever set of photographs they had so been looking forward too.

'He is only three but he is quite bright for his age he did realise that other people got theirs' done and he didn't and he has been talking about it to me and his dad,' Julieann added.

Headteacher Mrs Stoker said: 'Every family with a child at our school receives a home school agreement which includes the school uniform policy and extreme haircuts.

'Also letters are regularly sent out to remind parents of the school rules on extreme haircuts.

The school said: 'We are all disappointed that this year a handful of parents who chose to ignore the home school agreement policies and rules should deliberately disrupt those arrangements for everyone else'

'That agreement, drawn up and agreed by staff and parents/carers at our school is there to help maintain levels of attainment, behaviour and discipline and improve standards.

'For a number of years, we have taken the time and trouble to arrange a photographer to come into school to take pictures of children on behalf of their families without any problems.

'We are all disappointed that this year a handful of parents who chose to ignore the home school agreement policies and rules should deliberately disrupt those arrangements for everyone else.

'The vast majority of parents/carers of 370 pupils at our school respected the school uniform policy and will receive their photographs.'
