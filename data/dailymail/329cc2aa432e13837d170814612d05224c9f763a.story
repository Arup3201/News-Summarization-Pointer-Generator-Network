Ultimo has created a range of party-ready bras and who better to model them that lingerie-loving Abbey Clancy?

The  mother-of-one showcases her toned physique as she models the new range of bras.

The new collection features three problem-solving products, including the low back body, the low back bra and the strapless 'wear 5 ways' multi-way, all of which Abbey models to perfection as the face of the brand.

She's back! Abbey Clancy has been unveiled as the face of Ultimo's party lingerie range and models the problem-solving bras to perfection in the campaign shoot

Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Getting your foundation right is just important as the dress itself. 

'The new Ultimo collection offers women the chance to perfect their party look, whilst also boosting their cleavage and confidence.' 

Ironically, Abbey confessed to Grazia recently that she never wore a bra until she was 16.

She said: 'I only got my first bra when I was about 16 - I was still in thermal vests up until then, I was completely flat chested. Then all of a sudden I grew these humongous breasts.

'I've got a long relationship with underwear - I'd go so far as to say I've got a lingerie fetish. I think it's the first thing - the key thing - to make you feel good.'

Success: Abbey has seen her star rise this year and even turned her hand to designing as she unveiled a clothing range for Matalan 

This isn't the model's only coup this month - Abbey, 27, was unveiled as the new face of Avon fragrance and invited her 53-year-old mother to star alongside her.

The mother-daughter-duo look more like sisters in the new promotional images for the fragrance, Cherish, which launches just in time for Mother's Day.

The mother and daughter campaign stars are firm friends and Abbey often invites Karen to accompany her at showbiz parties.

Referring to Karen shortly after the birth of her own daughter in 2011, Abbey said: 'I weigh less than I weighed before I had the baby and I'm really happy with my figure.

'I'm lucky to be blessed with good genes. My mum is 51 and hasn't had any work done, but still looks like she could be my sister. She's a goddess.'

What's her secret? Abbey is a big fitness fan and is often seen leaving the gym where she clearly works hard to keep her body in shape

Clearly feeling the love for her family this month, Abbey last week expressed her devotion to her husband Peter Crouch by sharing a heart-warming picture on Instagram of him cuddling their three-year-old daughter Sophia on Sunday evening.

The sweet black-and-white snap shows the Stoke City striker lying on their wooden floor with their little girl lying on top of him and laughing.

The 28-year-old model proudly added the caption, 'My world', alongside the Instagram picture when she shared it with her 335k Twitter followers.

The Avon and Ultimo campaigns are the latest in a string of successes for the model and WAG, who also designs a range for Matalan and was unveiled as the face of Veet and Scholl earlier this year.
