A ban on American passenger jets flying in and out of Israel was lifted Wednesday night, 24 hours after the Federal Aviation Administration imposed restrictions.

The ruling grounded 160 flights due to take off or land at Tel Aviv amid safety concerns after a suspected Hamas rocket landed near the Ben Gurion airport.

The easing of restrictions comes as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg flew to Israel in a show of solidarity as deadly clashes with the Palestinian Authority continue.

A ban had been imposed Tuesday after a rocket strike landed about a mile from the international airport, prompting fears that passengers' lives could be put in danger.

The directive applied only to U.S. 
operators such as Delta Airlines, US Airways and American Airlines, and had
 no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport.

Even before the ban, Delta Air Lines turned around one of
its jets mid flight and indefinitely canceled all future flights between the
U.S. and Israel after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the airport

Other U.S. airlines quickly took similar action, and
counterparts in Europe and Canada followed within hours, despite protests from
the Israeli government.

Israeli airline El Al, which Bloomberg traveled on, maintained its regular flight
schedule.

After assessing the situation with its U.S. government counterparts, the FAA announced late on Wednesday that flights could resume.

The relevant agencies have reviewed new information about rocket strikes and taken into account measures the Israeli government has taken to limit risks to passenger jets.

After hearing about the ban Bloomberg had strongly urged the FAA to ‘reverse course’ and permit U.S. airlines to fly to Israel.

The billionaire released a statement stating his plans to fly on El Al to Tel Aviv Tuesday night to ‘show solidarity with the Israeli people and to 
demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.’

‘The
 U.S. flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved 
victory and should be lifted immediately,’ Bloomberg said.

Secretary of State John Kerry was also able to work around the FAA
restriction Wednesday when he arrived on an Air Force jet to try to broker a
cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, CBS News reported.

Although not covered by the FAA restrictions, other countries have been cautious about flights to Israel.

Germany's Lufthansa, Italian airline Alitalia and Air
France all acted before the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory.

Scandinavian Airlines canceled two flights from Copenhagen
to Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, and said it will rethink
the situation for two more flights this week.

Budget airline Norwegian said it had scrapped a flight from
Stockholm to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and was monitoring the events closely, the
airline's spokeswoman Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson said.

Also Wednesday, Royal Jordanian suspended its flights to
Ben Gurion until further notice, according to the airline's spokesman, Basil
al-Kilani.

Korean Air Lines Co. said on Friday that it was suspending
its flights between Incheon International Airport near Seoul and Tel Aviv until
at least Thursday, citing tensions between Israel and Palestine.

Lufthansa and Air Berlin later extended their cancellations
through Thursday and Air France said it was suspending its flights 'until
further notice.'

The European Aviation Safety Agency said it 'strongly
recommends' that airlines refrain from operating flights to and from Tel Aviv.

It said it would 'monitor the situation and advise on any
update as the situation develops.'

At least 160 flights at Ben Gurion had been canceled before the ban was lifted Wednesday, 80 incoming and 80 departing, Transportation Ministry director-general
Uzi Yitzhaki said.

Last year, an average of 1,044 passengers flew each way on
the four daily flights between the U.S. and Israel on American carriers,
according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Jack Ram, 50, of Tel Aviv, who was in New York visiting
friends, said threats of violence and disruptions while traveling were nothing
new for Israelis.

He prayed Tuesday before entering the departure area at
Newark, New Jersey, for his El Al flight to Israel. ‘We're used to it. That's how we live for the last 3,000 years
actually,’ Ram said.

Bloomberg has documented his trip to Israel on his Flickr account, where the businessman has shared photos taken during meetings with Israeli Prime 
Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres.

He
 also traveled to Jerusalem to visit the family of 24-year-old Sergeant 
Max Steinberg, a volunteer soldier from Southern California who was 
killed in the Gaza Strip Sunday.

Mr Bloomberg met with the Steinbergs 
at the Crowne Plaza Hotel where they are observing the traditional 
mourning period, known as Shiva, following Wednesday morning's funeral 
on Mount Herzl.
