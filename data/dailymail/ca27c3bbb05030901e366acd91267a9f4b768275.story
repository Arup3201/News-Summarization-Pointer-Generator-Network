Shellie Zimmerman, the estranged wife of George Zimmerman, was injured in a car accident this morning involving a driver suspected of DUI.

Shellie filed for divorce from husband George Zimmerman earlier this year, the man acquitted earlier this year in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, after he left her for another woman.

The accident took pace around 11:30am in Winter Park, Florida as Shellie was turning on Aloma Avenue from Phelps Avenue. Her car was struck by a driver running a red light.

The soon-to-be ex-Mrs Zimmerman was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries after suffering abrasions from the air bag and complaining about her foot.

A female friend was riding with her at the time and was also taken to the hospital.

Police arrested the driver responsible for the crash on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Shellie Zimmerman recently filed for divorce from her husband George after it was revealed he left her in the wake of his trial for another woman.

In July he was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin.

Throughout the trial, Shellie stood by her man, and was there the day he was let off the charges.

But their relationship took a turn after Zimmerman was released a free man.

In September, the two got involved in an altercation when Shellie announced she was leaving him. 

Shellie told police that her estranged husband punched her father in the face and smashed her iPad in an argument.

In the end, Shellie decided not to press charges, but said in a subsequent interview that she regretted the decision.

'In hindsight, I should've [pressed charges], and I really regret that, but I'm on probation and the officers made it very clear that day if I pressed charges we were all going to go to jail and I would've been the only one to stay there,' she told the Today show.

Shellie was put on probation in August in connection with her husband's case. She plead guilty to perjury for lying at a bail hearing after her husband's arrest. Her sentence was a year's probation and 100 hours of community service.
