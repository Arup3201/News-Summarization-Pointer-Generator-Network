Entertainer: As Max Bygraves, pictured, lay dying with Alzheimer's, it was natural he should hark back to his musical roots

He loved nothing more than a sing-along during his long showbusiness career.

So as Max Bygraves lay dying with Alzheimer’s, it was  natural he should hark back to his musical roots.

Despite being unable to comprehend that his wife had died, the much-loved entertainer continued to remember his entire back catalogue of more than 2,000 songs until the day he died aged 89, according to his grieving son.

Speaking for the first time about his
father’s death, Anthony Bygraves said the disease that ravaged his 
brain left his ability to recall lyrics unharmed.

Now
the 65-year-old – who worked as his father’s producer, manager and 
roadie – is using old Max Bygraves hits to help other dementia sufferers
cope with their affliction.

And
to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Society, he is re-releasing his 
father’s 1998 track Mary’s Boy Child as a Christmas single.

The married father of three, who 
lives in Bournemouth, said: ‘Dad loved singing along to his old songs in
the last few years of his life. Right until he died, he could remember 
every song he’d ever done – every refrain, every verse, chorus, where 
the change of key came.

‘He’d
recorded over 2,000 songs. He could remember them all, but he couldn’t 
remember where the bathroom was. Remembering words and tunes is one of 
the last parts of the memory to go.’

Anthony Bygraves now works as a volunteer for the Alzheimer’s Society’s Singing for the Brain service.

More than 200 groups of Alzheimer’s sufferers around Britain gather for weekly sing-alongs, helping them socialise and express themselves in supportive groups.

He said: ‘I help out in a group of 30 people. I just take some of my Dad’s albums down and we all sing along to them together. Lots of people know his old songs off by heart.

‘Singing them really helps people feel better for a bit.’

Max Bygraves died in August while staying with his daughter Christine in Australia. His wife Blossom had died last year, aged 88. Recounting his father’s last months, his son said: ‘When my Mum died things got really tough.

'They were together for 68 years but Dad was in a state where he couldn’t really grasp what had happened.

‘He’d say, “Where’s Mum?” I’d say, “She’s not here”, and then you’d have to change the subject. You could distract him like a young child. When I tried to explain she’d died he just couldn’t grasp it.’

An Alzheimer’s Society spokesman said: ‘Singing for the Brain provides a way for people with dementia to express themselves. Singing together can provide a way for people with dementia and their carers to communicate.

‘We are all very grateful to Anthony and the rest of the Bygraves family for thinking of us and generously releasing a single in support of our cause.’
