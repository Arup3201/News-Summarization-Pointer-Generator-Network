'I swear like a truck driver', she said.

'I refuse to pretend I'm somebody I'm not', she told abc.

New approach: Nadia Bolz-Weber is a rising star in the Lutheran church who has a growing congregation

Reverend Bolz-Weber, who has experimented with Wicca, is now the pastor of All Sinners and Saints - a Lutheran church in Denver, Colorado.

While normal church events might end with the congregation blessing themselves on the way out, this church prefers to have a dance party featuring a chocolate fountain in the baptismal font.

But despite her alternative approach, her quirky sermons which are littered with profanities has worked.

Her congregation is growing and hundreds of people now peer out from the among the pews to listen to her preach.

'We are all about Jesus. But to have humor and lightness and irreverence is our version of piety,' she told Spirituality and Health.

Nadia Bolz-Weber was once a drug and alcohol addict but turned to the church and hasn't looked back

The married mother-of-two has now written a spiritual memoir about her journey called Pastrix: The Cranky Faith of a Sinner and Saint. 

The book is near the top of the New York Times bestseller list after it was released in September.

And she doesn't hold back.

From a teenage rebellion against her fundamentalist Christianity, drug and alcohol addiction and doing stand-up in a comedy club in Denver, she describes herself as one of society's outsiders.

There are 66 million Lutherans worldwide, according to The Lutheran World Federation.

They follow a creed founded by the German monk and professor Martin Luther in the early 16th century, which makes it the oldest protestant denomination.

He was disillusioned with the Catholic Church, perceiving it to be corrupt and indulgent.

Germany is still the spiritual home of Lutheranism, but it's also the official state church of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland, according to religionfacts.com.

Bolz-Weber started getting tattoos when she was 17 but the ones on her arms are mainly religious.

She has the church year down one arm and images which include images for 
Advent, Christmas, Lent, Good Friday and Pentecost.

'In
 a way, my arms are like the stained glass in a medieval cathedral. They
 are pedagogical. How many times do people ask you, in a coffee shop, 
about the Christian faith?

'It
 happens to me all the time. "Oh, my gosh, what do your tattoos mean? 
They are beautiful." And then I’m telling the story of Jesus. It’s a 
no-brainer.'

As a teenager she felt that she never quite belonged and turned to drink and drugs for about a decade.

But she says she never stopped believing in God.

It was during her recovery that she met Lutheran seminary student Matthew Weber who brought her back to the church.

They married in 1996 and now have two children - a daughter who is 14 and son who is 12.
