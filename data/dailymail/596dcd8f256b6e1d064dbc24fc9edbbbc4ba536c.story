The widow of a man shot dead in the movie theater following a row over texting last week has said she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life.

'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview. 'To have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage.

'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.'

Oulson, who struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday, was at the movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida with her husband Chad on January 13 for a rare date. They had left their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter.

Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America on Thursday about the loss of her husband, Chad, who was shot dead in a movie theater last week. She said she wants his killer locked up forever

As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer, retired police officer Curtis Reeves, asked him to put it away.

An argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn - and Reeves, 71, shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot in her hand as she tried to protect her husband.

'The gun shot wound on my finger is the least of my worries right now,' she told Robin Roberts on GMA. 'That will heal. The real pain is in my heart. And that's going to take a long time, if ever, to get over.'

She recounted the tragic day, saying that she and her husband had long been looking to a cinema date because they work different schedules.

Vehement: Speaking beside her lawyer TJ Grimaldi, Oulson said the killer has given her a life sentence too

Support: Robin Roberts gave the grieving widow her condolences during Thursday morning's interview

'We just wanted to have a good day together, spend some quality time with the love of my life,' she said, smiling as she added: 'It was the first time we actually agreed on a movie together.'

After buying some concessions, they settled into their seats and started watching the previews.

'He took a couple of seconds just to check the phone before putting it away,' she said. 'In the blink of an eye - 30 seconds - and it just shattered my world.'

Lawyers representing the Oulson family 
have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close 
eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick
 her up.

Reeves, who was sitting behind the couple, asked Mr Oulson to put his phone away, but when he refused, Reeves left to speak with a manager.

Learning that the manager was busy, Reeves returned to his seat and started arguing with Oulson.

Seconds
 into the argument, Oulson apparently threw a bag of popcorn at the 
older man, who then drew a pistol from his pocket and shot the 
43-year-old dad in the chest.

Mrs Oulson said her husband was 'absolutely not' threatening the shooter.

'I never expected it,' she said. 'I never could have imagined it. There were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.'

Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense.

Charged: Curtis Reeves, 71, appears via video conference before Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper on January 14 as he was charged with second-degree murder for shooting dead the father-of-one

'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was
 popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason 
that it should have to escalate like this.'

Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter.

'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said.

But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed.

'The 
last thing he would say before tucking her in was, "You make me so happy," and she would say, "Me happy 
too, Daddy". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.'

Reeves, a father-of-two who was at the movie theater to see 'Lone Survivor' with his wife, was a former police chief in Tampa and worked as a security guard.

He appeared before Circuit Judge Lynn
 Tepper in Pasco County via video conference last week. Outside the 
courtroom, his lawyer said his client was 'heartbroken' that a life was 
lost in the shooting.

He has been charged with second-degree murder and is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail.

Chad's former colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy. Visit the page here.
