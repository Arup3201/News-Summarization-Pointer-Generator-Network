Billions of jellyfish are appearing around our coastlines following weeks of warm weather.

Huge billowing blooms, each containing thousands of jellyfish, have suddenly appeared in our waters as the animals respond to high sea temperatures.

These pictures, which show an ethereal mass of moon jellyfish, were taken by kayaker John Bentley off the beach at Newquay in Cornwall.

Huge billowing blooms, each containing thousands of jellyfish, have suddenly appeared in our waters as the animals respond to high sea temperatures. Moon jellyfish are not dangerous to humans, only giving a mild sting

Mr Bentley, 43, said: ‘I’ve lived here all my life and I have never seen anything like it.

‘There were just thousands of them, floating there in huge masses. I was in the canoe with my two sons Rhys, who is ten, and Calum, who is eight, and there they were, all these jellyfish.

‘It was quite a sight.’

Jellyfish, which are known by conservationists as a barometer of the seas, are remarkably sensitive to changes in temperature, pollution and numbers of predators and food sources.

Statistics released yesterday by the Met Office show that we have had a remarkably warm June, which is on track to be the sixth warmest since records began in 1910.

The month so far has seen average temperatures of 14.4C (57.9F) - 1.4C above average.

'There were just thousands of them, floating there in huge masses. I was in the canoe with my two sons Rhys, who is ten, and Calum, who is eight, and there they were, all these jellyfish,' said Mr Bentley

The common blue jellyfish, which has a strong sting, is worth steering clear of

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘This continues a run of seven months where the UK mean temperature was warmer than average, with all the months from December through to April each being at least 1C warmer than the long-term average.’

The warm and dry weather looks set to go out with a very wet weekend, with downpours forecasted for today before a drier day tomorrow.

The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours today.

Moon jellyfish are not dangerous to humans, only giving a mild sting.

Another species which has been seen in large numbers in recent weeks is the massive barrel jellyfish, a spectacular large species which can grow up to 4ft long and weigh three stone (20kg).

It also can only cause mild discomfort to humans, but the common blue jellyfish which has a stronger sting, is worth steering clear of.

Richard Harrington, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘It has been a good year for jellyfish sightings so far.

‘Moon jellyfish seem to magically appear in large numbers, when daylight lengthens and sea temperature rises, but this is quite normal.

‘We have seen unusually high numbers of another type of jellyfish - the barrel – a large oceanic species that can grow to well over a metre long.  

Another species which has been seen in large numbers in recent weeks is the massive barrel jellyfish, a spectacular large species which can grow up to four feet long and weigh three stone (20kg). The one above was spotted by the River Fal in Cornwall

‘Both species are largely harmless, but we always advise bathers to avoid touching them, as some jellyfish do possess a powerful sting.’

Matt Slater, of Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘The warm weather we have had over the last few weeks has definitely led to an increase in the number of jellyfish.

‘We have seen more of these large barrel jellies than at any time since 2002 and there have been thousands of moon jellies - in some places the sea is just thick with them.

‘Jellyfish go through a boom and bust cycle due to the way they reproduce. You either get thousands at a time, or you get none - there isn’t an in-between state.’

Dr Cathy Lucas, of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, said huge blooms of moon jellyfish are usually seen when tides or winds blow thousands of the animals into a bay or cove.

She added: ‘Warmer weather tends to cause a boom of plankton in the water, and that is what jellyfish eat. But it is a complex picture, to do with their reproduction cycles as well as the warm weather.’
