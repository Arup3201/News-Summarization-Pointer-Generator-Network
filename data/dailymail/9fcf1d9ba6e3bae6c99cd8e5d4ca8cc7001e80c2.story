I never thought I’d say this but I actually feel sorry for Manchester United. A little bit. Maybe.

For years and years, Sir Alex Ferguson ran the referees, the clocks and the rules, but now that’s all gone. It surely can’t be a conscious thing from referees, but doesn’t it look to you as if United are now being punished for that?

They were comfortable against Leicester on Sunday. When they went 3-1 in front you wondered how many goals they would rack up at the King Power Stadium.

But inexplicably Mark Clattenburg saw fit to completely ignore Foxes’ striker Jamie Vardy bulldozing into United full back Rafael. 

And to compound such a terrible error, Clattenburg chose to give a penalty when Rafael breathed on Vardy’s back in the box. Clattenburg can’t give one and not the other. Dreadful decision making from a referee who seems to have had a common sense bypass operation in the summer. He wasn’t great at the Emirates the week before.

United’s defending from then on was appalling and they collapsed way too easily.

But the main reason the game turned around so dramatically was the momentum Leicester gained from such a woeful refereeing decision. In some ways, they only realised they could win the game when they felt the referee was on their side.

Leicester’s fight will rightly be applauded. But Vardy’s blatant dive for that first penalty will be ignored because it doesn’t fit the script of the underdog’s incredible comeback against the expensive giants.

Leicester City are the kind of side who never give up – they’ve finally shaken off their 'chokers' tag after securing promotion last season. 

And I’ve enjoyed watching them this season - they’ve brought some adventure to the Premier League, and they’re doing it with players from non-League, lower league and through their own ranks. So let’s respect how they powered on to win the game in spectacular fashion. 

Without that ridiculous penalty decision though, you wonder where they would have found the belief they needed.

United have suffered in other games this season: a Burnley defender virtually caught the ball in the area towards the end of the goalless draw at Turf Moor, yet no penalty was given.

I know there are a large number of football fans who don’t like Manchester United: they will see this as karma for all the years of Fergie seemingly running things. They will also find it very funny.
