If your iPhone 6 Plus has become bent out of shape, Apple may offer you a replacement.

A support employee told The Next Web during a web chat that the decision would be '100% up to the store' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case-by-case basis.

But, the employee added that if, following an inspection, the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone's warranty.

Since the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) launched on Friday, reports have emerged that 'a small but growing number' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time. An Apple support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case-by-case basis

Apple has not released an official line about the replacements, and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent.

The problem, dubbed 'bend gate' by some 
on social media sites, is due to the phone's thinner aluminium exterior - 
but can be solved by ensuring the middle of the phone is not subjected 
to a large force.

It is believed that the thinner  model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform.

A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger, shows the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers. It has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times. 

MacRumors detailed on Tuesday that 'a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch'.

During the web chat, The Next Web journalist asked if a 'bent enclosure occurring during normal use' would be covered by a warranty. The support employee, replied: 'That is 100 per cent up to the Genius you speak with at the store.' A Genius is an Apple employee (stock image) who works in stores

The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium.

Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move.

According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot.

This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending.

This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot.

These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend.

To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone.

For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending.

Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option.

Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.

During the web chat, The Next Web journalist Josh Ong asked if a 'bent enclosure occurring during normal use' would be covered by a warranty.

The support employee, who has not been named, replied: 'That is 100 per cent up to the Genius you speak with at the store.'

A Genius is an Apple support employee who works in stores around the world.

The online employee continued that the Genius would carry out a test known as a Visual Mechanical Inspection, and if the damage was within the guidelines, Apple would be able to cover it.

It
 has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5-inch phone and the use of aluminum on 
the frame will cause the new iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) to bend if pressure is applied

The bendy feature of the new iPhone (pictured) has been met with wide criticism on social media

The bendy feature of the new iPhone was met with wide criticism on social media and some hashtagged 'bendgate' as they poked fun at the defect.

One user wrote: '@tim_cook hi Tim, I absolutely love my new iPhone 6 Plus!! My favorite feature is the flexible display.' 

However this isn't the first time iPhone frames have warped while the issue isn't unique to Apple, Mashable reports.

It was further mentioned the thinner design and the use of aluminum on the frame causes the phone to misshape if pressure is applied.

However, other Twitter users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure.

App developer ‏@drbarnard said: 'It’s actually impressive that the 6 Plus doesn’t break. Seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage.'

While TechCrunch co-editor @panzer added: 'Just an anecdote: I carried around the iPhone 6 Plus for 5 days in a pocket at Disneyland on rides & coasters and did not bend it.'

Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses.

The iPhone 5S release last year was met with similar complaints.

Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) announced on Monday the firm sold over 10 million of its 'bigger than bigger' models, setting a new three-day sales record. It beat the iPhone 5S and 5C's record of 9 million

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display.

Both
 models also include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 
64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power 
efficiency.

They
 also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US 
will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay.

Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments.

In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB.

A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK.

The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB.

Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK.

Samsung devices are also vulnerable, and the Galaxy S4 in particular was found to bend under pressure, as did Sony's Xperia Z1.

Other
 devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to 
have a curved frame, including the LG G Flex and the Samsung Round.

Both devices were said to be more comfortable to hold, and easier to place in a back pocket.

Apple
 announced on Monday it sold over 10 million of its 'bigger than bigger'
 model, setting a new record since it launched three days after the 
launch on Friday.

This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C.

However Apple has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment regarding the issues with the latest model.

This isn't the first time iPhone frames have bent or warped (pictured), and the issue isn't unique to Apple. Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses. The iPhone 5S release was met with similar complaints. Samsung devices are also vulnerable, and the Galaxy S4 in particular was found to bend

These reports are not the first time iPhone frames have warped, and the issue isn't unique to Apple.

And as Apple's bad week continues, the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset.

Users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to iOS 8.0.1 robbed them of signal, data service and the Touch ID capability.

As its the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday, many are claiming the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the most troubled new products since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.'

Shortly after the iPhone 4 launched in 2012, customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame.

Apple issued a statement advising customers should 'avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner' when making or receiving a call, which was met with even more complaints.

However, the company acted quickly to pull iOS 8.0.1 from the Apple store when users began reporting the problems within minutes of its release.

The glitch appears to affect only the newest iPhones - not iPhone 5C or 5S, or older models.

Apple users on networks across the US, Britain and Canada were reporting problems via Twitter and official support forums after updating their operating systems.

Apple announced it was investigating the glitch, but in the meantime recommended that owners of affected iPhones restore their devices by connecting to iTunes.

In an official statement, the tech giant said: 'We apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue.'

The Samsung Galaxy Round (pictured), revealed last year, is another phone designed to have an intentional curved display. It has a 5.7-inch concave screen attached to a curved casing, which Samsung says can boost the viewing angle for videos
