Villagers campaigning against an illegal gipsy site on green belt land opposite their homes marked the 1,000th day of their round-the-clock protest camp yesterday.

The hardy band, many in their seventies, have huddled under a tarpaulin with little more than a fire for comfort every day and night since the Romany gipsies arrived in May 2010.

The gipsies bought the eight-acre paddock in Meriden, West Midlands, for £100,000 but were stopped from laying hardcore when villagers formed a human chain to turn away their diggers.

Since then around 200 members of 
Residents Against Inappropriate Development have braved storms, floods, 
snow and torrential rain to make sure there is no further development.

Last night, as temperatures dipped towards minus 5C (23F), the group marked the 1,000-day milestone with a warming curry.

The 'Meriden gypsies' paid a local businessman £100,000 for the paddock and moved onto it over the May Day Bank Holiday in 2010 when the council were powerless to stop them.

Since the move, the determination of villagers to preserve the Meriden Gap greenbelt which separates the village from Coventry and Solihull has been relentless.

Residents descended on the eight-acre plot and formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening.

Ever since, around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further, working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight.

The determined residents even had Christmas dinner in their protest camp in case the travellers again tried to develop the site any further.

But the residents did not have planning permission for the camp - which stands on a builders' yard driveway immediately opposite the gypsy settlement - and, last February, the Tory-run authority voted to issue an enforcement against it.

A month later the travellers at the site lost a High Court battle and now have to leave the site by March 31 this year.

David McGrath, chairman of RAID, said ‘We have been here in temperatures of minus 17 and we will continue.’

He said that the gypsies now keep a 'caretaker presence' returning only during the day to deal scrap metal.

He said: 'They aren't there at night, there aren't many people there at all, they just keep a caretaker presence.

'Some of them come here every day to deal scrap metal but they don't live on the site.

'None of them are local people, they came from all over the place as part of this scheme, it's just about land value, if they can get planning permission they make a £100,000 piece of field worth millions.

'It's not about need, it's about greed.

Determined: The villagers will not celebrate nor will they go home until the gypsys have moved

The estimated 200 villagers are aged between 60 and 90 and say they have survived the floods and snow

A makeshift tent was erected by the villages nearby the gypsy camp but council bosses ruled they had no right to be there

'We aren't celebrating the 1,000 days here, we will be marking it, we won't celebrate anything until they are gone and the land returned to the former state.

'There is an order for them to leave the site in March and within a month return the site to greenbelt land.

'But they say they aren't leaving, it will be up to the council to make sure it doesn't turn into another Dale Farm.

'We have survived freezing conditions, snow and even floods, you can't drive to the site now because of the snow.

'But we won't leave until the site returns to it's former state from the muddy mess it is now.'

But despite the deadline for their 
eviction being just nine weeks away, the defiant gypsies today stuck two
fingers up at the planning process - and vowed 'we will not be moved.'

Noah Burton, spokesman for the travellers, said: 'We are living in mud and s***, Where are we going to go

'What are they going to do with us? Are they going to take us to the gas chambers? It didn't work for Hitler.

'They [the villagers] are the biggest hypocrites on the planet. It's all about the value of their homes.

'We have old people, we have disabled people.

'If
any other ethnic group of people had to live in these conditions there 
would be uproar. It would not be allowed, but gypsies are easy targets.

'For
18 months I have bombarded Solihull Council asking for somewhere to go.
There is nowhere. How are you going to resolve this?

'If
the council find us somewhere else to go then we will go, how are we 
supposed to find somewhere to go if they can't with all their massive 
resources?

'If they have not found anywhere for us to go then we will not be going anywhere, put simply, we will not be moved.'

The High Court has given the gipsies until March 31 to leave.
