In these days of movie megastars and overly precious pop stars, we have all heard stories of celebrity guests who make outrageous demands of the hotels they frequent.

But it seems that many members of the general public can be just as diva-like – and delusional – when it comes to what they expect of the places in which they stay.

Ring ring: According to the survey, strange requests made by hotel guests have included goat bells to aid sleep

Outrageous orders and crazy complaints regularly stretch the patience of even the best-trained staff, according to a research conducted by flight comparison website Skyscanner.

The survey – which questioned 400 hotel staff in 49 countries – reveals a world of grasping guests and cantankerous customers for whom no tantrum is too ridiculous.

Skyscanner has compiled a list of the ten most unusual requests made by hotel guests – as well as the top ten most outlandish complaints.

Woof woof: One guest complained that his dog was unhappy with the level of service at the hotel, and did not enjoy its stay, while another difficult customer wanted mineral water - not for drinking, but for the toilet bowl

The latter line-up includes far-from-happy customers appalled that their room did not come with a sea view, even though they were staying miles from the coast, a light sleeper angry that they had been kept awake by their own girlfriend’s snoring – and a peeved diner unamused to find that a vegetarian menu in a hotel restaurant did not include steak.

1. One glass of water on the hour every hour, through the night2. 15 cucumbers a day3. Toilet to be filled with mineral water4. Bath filled with honey5. Sound of goat bells to aid sleep6. Only the right legs of a chicken to be served7. A dead mouse8. Bath full of chocolate milk9. 16 pillows (for a single guest)10. Crocodile soup

1. The sheets are too white2. The sea is too blue3. Ice cream is too cold4. Bath is too big5. Girlfriend’s snoring has kept guest awake6. Guest’s dog did not enjoy its stay7. Hotel has no ocean view (in London)8. There is no steak on the vegetarian menu9. Waiter is too handsome10. Mother of groom has not been given the honeymoon suite

Other fantastical flashpoints included a guest upset that the bath in their suite was too big, and an animal lover who wanted a discount because his dog had not enjoyed its stay.

And some people, it seems, are never happy. One guest was moved to raise a concern about the waiter who served them at dinner – saying he was too handsome for their liking.

The list of unlikely requests features a range of demands that would surely make the most riotous rock star or highly-strung actress blush.

One guest wanted a glass of water to be delivered to their room – on the hour, every hour, throughout the night. Another insisted that they could not drop off into the land of nod without the sounds of the mountains – and could a range of goat bells be provided?

No no: According to the research, a guest complained that the waiter serving them was too handsome - while another asked for chicken for their dinner, as long as they were served only right legs from available poultry

Another wanted a dinner of chicken.

Not too outrageous, you might think – except for the fact that, the guest stipulated, only legs from the right side of the chicken should be served as part of the meal.

Other food-themed blasts from the barely believable included a customer who wanted a bowl of crocodile soup, and a weight-watcher who asked for 15 cucumbers per day.

Incredible en-suite-related wishes included baths filled with honey or chocolate milk.

And spare a thought for staff at the hotel where a guest demanded a further bathroom-linked change to the room: they wanted their toilet to be filled with mineral water.
