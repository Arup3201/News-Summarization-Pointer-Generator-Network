An investor and a California winery owner are dead after an apparent murder-suicide in a bucolic Napa Valley vineyard following a business deal gone awry.

Napa County vintner Robert Dahl allegedly shot dead Emad Tawfilis in a vineyard overlooking Highway 29, the main route through the region, Monday afternoon as a result of a long-standing dispute over money.

Dahl then fled into the wooded hills between Napa and Sonoma valleys, with sheriff's deputies in hot pursuit, and shot himself.

Murder in a vineyard: Napa Valley winery owner Robert Dahl (pictured) allegedly killed an investor who had sued him for fraud before turning the gun on himself 

Shady dealings: Dahl, the owner of Santa Rosa Winery, had been accused of swindling $1.2million in loans 

Crime scene: Dahl and his investor Emad Tawfilis had a meeting Monday morning, and less than 30 minutes later Tawfilis called 911 saying he had been shot in a vineyard overlooking Highway 29

Kousha Berokim, a Los Angeles attorney who represented Dahl, told Santa Rosa Press Democrat his client and Tawfilis had met Monday morning at Dahl's winery to discuss a loan dispute.

He says Tawfilis was suing his client, claiming Dahl defrauded him out of $1.2million.

Beroukim, who took part in a 11am meeting between Dahl and Tawfilis over a conference call, said both parties agreed to work out their differences, and that neither one sounded upset or hostile.

Just before noon Monday, Tawfilis made a frantic 911 call from Santa Rosa Winery telling the dispatcher that he had been shot, and that 'someone was coming after him.'

Sheriff's deputies raced to the vineyard and arrived just in time to witness two men standing in the middle of the property, one of them holding a gun.

The armed suspect was then spotted running to a parked SUV and peeling off in the direction of Sonoma County.

Frantic search: Dahl got into his SUV and led sheriff's deputies on a 10-mile chase 

Final destination: Dahl's vehicle crashed through a fence and came to rest in the woods. His body was later inside by a SWAT team

One of the responding deputies went in pursuit of the SUV while another rushed to the remaining man, later identified as Emad Tawfilis, who had collapsed to the ground with a gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Meanwhile, multiple sheriff's vehicles followed Dahl's SUV, which was eventually found 10 miles away trapped in some bushes. 

Believing that Dahl fled the vehicle on foot, officers set up a perimeter and called in a helicopter to help search for the suspect from the air. Nearby residents were urged to stay indoors and call 911 if they noticed something suspicious.

It was not until a SWAT team arrived on the scene that Dahl’s vehicle was opened. Inside, they discovered the man’s lifeless body.

A native of Minnesota, Robert Dahl moved to Northern California about five years ago and started several wine-related ventures, including Dahl Vineyards in 2013.

He also briefly tried his hand at making beer, but his brewery and gastropub quickly failed.

According to court documents cited by Napa Valley Register, Emad Tawfilis's investment firm, Lexington Street Investments, sued Dahls' company, Patio Wine Co, for fraud, accusing the owner of accepting a $1.2million loan towards a failed venture and then using the money for other businesses.

The bitter dispute between the two sides has been carefully documented by the site Wine Industry Insight.

According to his social media account, Dahl is survived by his wife and two grown children, a son and daughter.
