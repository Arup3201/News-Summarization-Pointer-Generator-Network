An abandoned Seattle building that was the scene of Washington state's grisliest massacre in 1983 has caught fire.

Firefighters worked overnight on Christmas Eve to bring the fire in the 104-year-old China Town building under control.

Since 13 people were shot dead at the one-time illegal gambling den the three-storey building has remained mainly vacant, with residents claiming it is haunted.

Blaze: A fire broke out on the top floor of this Seattle building on Christmas Eve

The force of the blaze cut power to 500 surrounding homes and businesses, and forced more than 20 residents to leave their homes, as flames took hold of the building, the Seattle Times reported.

The out-of-control blaze began on the abandoned top floor of the building, at 665 South King Street, at 4pm yesterday and no one knows yet what caused it.

The top two floors were vacant, but China's Chamber of Commerce and a popular gift shop were on the first floor.

Authorities said the fire was not related to the massacre but as flames, estimated to be up to 30ft tall, were spotted, its past was brought back up.

The grisly past of the former gambling den has left those living nearby feeling uneasy for decades. Even the homeless are said to steer clear of the property.

'That building's haunted,' Joaquin 
Uy, a social-services advocate said, after hearing of the blaze. Since the massacre, it has been a popular destination for ghost hunters and crime scene tourists.

Deserted: The doors of the gambling den have been padlocked since the massacre, though successful businesses have opened in other parts of the building

Since the massacre, the doors have been padlocked and the gambling den deserted. Various ghost hunters have reported peering through the grimy window to see a room frozen in time.

In the early hours of February 19, 1983, three gunmen broke into the club's basement, where they hogtied, robbed and shot 14 people.

The one survivor was able to identify the assailants, two of whom are serving life sentences without parole.

The third, Wai Chiu 'Tony' Ng, who was convicted of robbery and assault, was granted parole in October, after 30 years in jail. He has been handed over to Immigration and is due to be deported to Hong Kong.
