You probably associate Italian football with defenders. And you'd be right; Franco Baresi, Giuseppe Bergomi, Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro defended the blue shirt with style and steel. Those thoroughbreds made goal prevention an art.

But the Azzurri also pride themselves on their goalscorers. From thick-necked battering rams to heaven-sent magicians.

Times have changed. Last week an excellent column by Gazzetta dello Sport's Fabio Licari bemoaned the lack of goalscoring options available to national coach Antonio Conte. It's an uncomfortable feeling shared by fans.

Euro 2016 is 15 months away and the four-times world champions don't have a regular source of goals. Agricultural defender Giorgio Chiellini is the top scorer of the Conte era (since the 2014 World Cup) with two strikes.

The Legends

Nostalgia for the old guys grows stronger by the game. Articles lionise yesterday's sharpshooters. The adored Giuseppe Meazza, after whom Inter and Milan's stadium is named, shot Italy to glory in the 1930s. The Azzurri's late 1960s and World Cup 1970 renaissance owed much to the thunderous force of Cagliari idol Luigi Riva.

Another granite-faced striker, Giorgio Chinaglia enjoyed a short but colourful career with the national team in the early and mid-1970s. In 1982 Paolo Rossi spearheaded his country's third World Cup win with a craftier, subtle approach.

There was a brief return to the dominant, blockbuster forward with the selfless Gianluca Vialli and blunderbuss Christian Vieri. Perhaps the most famous and popular modern Italian attacker, the masterly Roberto Baggio, played alongside Vialli and Vieri at World Cups, bewitching the football-loving world. His goals drove his team to the 1994 World Cup final.

State of the Nation

It doesn't help Conte that four out of five of Serie A's top scorers are foreign. Juventus' Carlos Tevez, Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli and Palermo's Paolo Dybala are Argentinian, while Milan star Jeremy Menez is from France. Only Luca Toni (Verona) is Italian, but he is 37 and his career in the national team ended in 2009.

Tevez's principal partner at Juve, Alvaro Morata, is a Spaniard. Inter's regular striker force of Mauro Icardi and Rodrigo Palacio hail from the land of the Tango. Roma rarely use an orthodox centre-forward, but rely on the pace of Ivorian ex-Arsenal man Gervinho.

Simone Zaza and Ciro Immobile are Conte's first choice partnership. After a typically honest but fruitless performance in Italy's 2-2 draw in rain-lashed Bulgaria on Saturday, Zaza admitted: 'I was not satisfied with my performance.'

Only Luca Toni is playing well in Serie A at the moment, but he retired from international football in 2009

The Sassuolo man was subbed after 58 minutes of the Euro 2016 group H qualifier. Journalist and broadcaster Massimo Callegari says: 'Zaza has good technique and physical attributes, but needs to be more consistent and a bit calmer. When he is having a bad game he loses self-control and gets booked too often. He loses focus.'

Immobile is suffering from a lean spell in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund. The Neapolitan is a direct, tidy player, but his confidence is low. Mattia Destro, on loan at Milan from Roma, is in a similar mess.

A classic box player, Destro is only as good as the service he receives. Milan' s struggles have reduced his efficacy and dampened his spirit. And before you ask, Liverpool's Mario Balotelli isn't Conte's cup of tea, to put it diplomatically.

Conte does not have a large pool of strikers to choose from, and many are going through a barren spell

The only good news from that draw in Sofia was Eder's stunning 84th minute equaliser. The Brazil-born Sampdoria firecracker, unwanted by Selecao chief Dunga, has the flair and unpredictability to give Italy back its goals and smile.

At 28 years of age, it's unlikely Eder will make the impact of Baggio or even World Cup 1990 saviour Toto Schillaci. He might get his adopted nation through a difficult patch though. England have been warned. 

Ranked by the joy they gave Italian football fans, here are five of the Azzurri' s most cherished netbusters:

Giuseppe Meazza

The undisputed leader. Meazza (1910-1979), known as the Da Vinci of football, was acrobatic, a master dribbler and had an unerring shot. The first poster boy of calcio, he scored 33 goals in 53 international games.

Roberto Baggio

Anyone who saw the 1994 World Cup knows the majesty of Baggio. Enduring more aches and gripes than the cast of Dad's Army, the gutsy genius dragged his team to the final. 'Roby' also shone at the '90 and '98 World Cups. 27 goals in 56 matches.

Paolo Rossi

His early performances at the 1982 World Cup were pallid. But, with the unbending support of his manager Enzo Bearzot, the nippy little poacher sprung into life in the knockout stages, scoring six times, including a hat-trick against Brazil. 20 goals, 48 matches.

Luigi Riva

Still Ia Nazionale's top scorer with 35 goals from 42 games, Riva's shots measured 140km/h, which would be closer to 200km/h with modern balls. Known as the Thunderclap, uncompromising Riva was instrumental to the Italy side which finished runners-up at the 1970 World Cup.

Christian Vieri

Despite all the headlines regarding his hectic private life, brilliant 'Bobo' plundered five goals in a cautious Italy team at the 1998 World Cup, and four more in 2002 in Japan and Korea. A bulldozing, brave target man with outstanding aerial ability, he gave his team a brutish, British edge. 23 goals, 49 matches.
