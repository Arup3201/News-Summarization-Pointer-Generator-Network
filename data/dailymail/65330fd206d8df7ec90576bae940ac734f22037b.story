Colombia striker Carlos Bacca has a leg injury and will be out for the rest of the World Cup group stage.

The Sevilla player sustained a leg muscle strain in training and will be sidelined for Thursday's game against Ivory Coast and the match against Japan on June 24.

A statement from Colombia's Football Federation read: 'Following the tests done by Colombia's medical team, led by Doctor Carlos Ulloa, it has been determined that player Carlos Bacca has suffered a first degree muscle strain and will require a period of treatment from seven to 10 days.'

Missing out: Carlos Bacca will miss Colombia's World Cup games with Ivory Coast and Japan

Bacca was on the bench in Colombia's 3-0 triumph over Greece in their Group C opener on Saturday.

The 27-year-old's absence is a blow for Cafeteros coach Jose Pekerman considering Bacca's solid season with Sevilla.

Bacca scored 14 league goals in 35 Primera Liga appearances and was voted by Spanish sports newspaper Marca as the best signing of the 2013-14 La Liga season.
