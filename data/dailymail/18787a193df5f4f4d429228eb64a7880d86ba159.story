'There was a lady that we were close to growing up,' Undergaro recalled.

'She was gracious enough to take us in and it was just an unfinished basement.'

Menounos says that it was in that basement, on a mattress on the floor surrounded by spiders, where her dreams of Tinseltown came alive listening to Howard Stern's radio show.

So began Menounos's road to stardom moving to LA and later becoming a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.

'My parents came out to visit,' Menounos said.

'My dad apologized to Keven which I think is such a sign of, I don't know.
