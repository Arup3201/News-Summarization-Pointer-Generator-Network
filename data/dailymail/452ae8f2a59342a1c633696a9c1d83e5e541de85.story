It was a fashion face-off that proved style has no age limit.

Oscar-winner Helen Mirren, 68, was pictured wearing the same red Dolce & Gabbana dress popstar Rita Ora, 22, wore just a few weeks previously.

The actress paired her floor-length racy lace number with a full slip allowing her shape to take centre stage in Hong Kong on Thursday, as Ora wore the transparent frock over a leopard print body, showing off her legs in all their glory.

Mirren stunned in the slinky number, which clung to her curves in all the right places, to celebrate 50 years of the Mandarin Oriental hotel.

The actress made sure not to show off too much skin and opted to wear a pair of eye-catching large cross shaped earrings with a matching belt which resembled rosary beads around her waist.

Her short blonde hair was styled sleekly and she completed her look with bright red lipstick.

Ora, meanwhile, rocked an unlined version of the dress on a girls' night out in Las Vegas and also to perform at a recent charity concert at the end of last month.

The How We Do singer sounded show-stopping at the gig in memory of Stephen Lawrence, and showed off her slender figure in the Cordetto lace dress with long sleeves.

While the outfit may have covered her top to toe, the see-through lace material meant her slim legs could be seen beneath as she wore just a body underneath.

Completing her sexy stage look she wore her hair long and sleek, while of course she completed her look with her trademark red lipstick.

Mirren is an avid fan of Dolce & Gabbana, choosing to wear the label for many public appearances. The crucifix earrings she paired with her dress were a welcome touch, as they were part of D&G's original catwalk styling.

While Ora's career has gone from strength to strength in recent months, the singer was well and truly trumped in the fashion stakes by modest Mirren last week.
