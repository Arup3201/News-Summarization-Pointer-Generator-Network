A hunter in the remote wilds of Alaska has been rescued in an elaborate mission by the Alaska Air National, 36 hours after he was mauled and nearly killed by a grizzly bear.

The man was on a hunting trip with a guide north of Anatuvuk Pass, Alaska, nearly 300 miles from the nearest city when he was attacked and severely injured on Wednesday. A trained medic who happened to be with a nearby hunting party was able to stabilize him and minimize blood loss.

Dense fog descended on the area and hampered air evacuation efforts by local rescue teams and the Alaska State Police.

The man was on a guided hunt in the wilds of Alaska, hundreds of miles from civilization, when he was attacked and nearly killed by a grizzly bear

The 11th Air Force Rescue Coordination Center learned of the man's plight Thursday, about 36 hours after the attack and mounted a massive rescue effort with personnel from the Air National Guard.

The man, whose name was not released, had suffered severe blood loss and other injuries and was at risk of drying in the remote wilderness if he was not evacuated to a hospital.

Officials credited the medic who first treating his wounds with saving the man's life.

'He was able to decrease the blood loss and maintain life until help could arrive,' said Master Sergeant Armando Soria, a search and rescue controller with the coordination center.

'He provided expert care with limited resource for several hours, ultimately stabilizing, warming and rehydrating the victim.'

No details about the bear attack were released.

The Alaska Air National Guard sent a search-and-rescue plane carrying a helicopter crew from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage.

They landed at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, where a helicopter had been prepared for them. Together, the plane, an HC-130 search and rescue aircraft, and helicopter headed more than 280 miles northwest to the victim.

The plane's crew launched illumination flares to guide the HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter through Anaktuvuk Pass and to help find the site.

The man was trapped in such a remote area that the HC-130 plane had to refuel the helicopter in mid-air during the flight, between cloud layers.

The helicopter reached the victim before 3am Friday.

The man was brought to the Air Force base just before 5am, then taken by ambulance to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. He was listed in stable condition there Saturday.
