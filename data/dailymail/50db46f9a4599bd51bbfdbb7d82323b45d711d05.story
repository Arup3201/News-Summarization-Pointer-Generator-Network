Strict new rules have been introduced after an increase in overseas visitors not eligible for free NHS care

Patients are having to prove they are entitled to free NHS care when they go to hospital in a crackdown on health tourism.

They are asked for evidence showing they have lived in Britain for at least a year by producing bills, pay slips or bank statements.

The one-year rule has existed for many years but has clearly not been effectively enforced.

Clampdown: Staff working at Southend Hospital in Essex must ask patients if they have lived in the country for the past 12 months

Recent figures suggested that as much as £40million is owed to hospitals by so-called health tourists who have been treated but never paid their bills.

The checks apply to outpatients and those admitted to wards, but not to emergency cases, who will be looked after regardless.

The scheme has been introduced to identify foreign patients who try to get free care on the NHS, despite not being eligible.

Doctors and nurses at Southend University Hospital in Essex ask all patients coming in for the first time whether they have lived in the country for at least a year.

Health Minister Simon Burns (pictured) last year revealed that health tourists have taken at least £35million of free treatment over the last eight years.

That is the sum health service bosses have written off after foreign patients came to the UK for treatment – and left without paying.

The Department of Health is still trying to recover millions more from thousands of others who have abused British hospitality, so the real figure could be far higher.

Entitlement to free NHS hospital treatment is based on a patient being ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK.

Anyone else will be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive unless an exemption applies to the particular therapy.While treatment in an accident and emergency department is automatically free to all, emergency care elsewhere is not.

However urgent treatment, such as maternity care, will always be given regardless of residence status or ability to pay afterwards.

UK Border Agency officials see 150 cases a year at Gatwick Airport of heavily pregnant passengers arriving with visitor visas.

Last year the Home Office and Department of Health admitted the existing system 'is still too complex, generous and inconsistently applied.'

They promised stricter checks to make sure the details of overseas patients are properly recorded so hospitals can recover any debt.

Also those visitors who have run up £1,000 or more in medical debts will not be allowed back into the country.

They may also double check by going back through medical records of previous treatment.

And if staff are still suspicious, they will ask patients to provide proof of address.

Julie Alabaster, private and business manager at Southend hospital, said the expansion of the nearby airport and coastal port could lead to an increase in the number of health tourists.

She added: ‘We know that people won’t always tell the truth and we won’t be able to capture everyone.

‘But we need to be doing everything we can to get money back from patients who are not entitled to NHS treatment for free.’  

She said those who were ineligible for free treatment would be asked to pay by cash or via a chip and pin machine brought to their beds.

The trust is owed £64,913 by health tourists.

But many trusts are out of pocket by far more, including St George’s in South London, which is owed £2million.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who has been exposing the cost of health tourists to the NHS, said: ‘This is a very sensible idea, for which the hospital should be commended.

‘All NHS trusts should be applying this test which should be rolled out nationally.

'We need to get a grip on the issue of foreign nationals abusing the NHS – it is a national health service, not an international one.’

Similar schemes have also been introduced at The Hillingdon Hospitals Foundation Trust in West London, East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust and Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust in Surrey.

Last month, figures obtained by Pulse magazine through freedom of information requests showed that hospitals were owed an average of £230,000 from health tourists.

Yet despite the crackdown on health tourists, it has also emerged that some doctors have been threatened with legal action if they do not treat illegal immigrants.

One surgery in Essex was recently told by human rights lawyers they would be taken to court if they refused to add a group of failed asylum seekers to their books.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Hospitals have a legal duty to recover any charges made to overseas patients.

‘We have changed the immigration rules so that anyone with an unpaid debt to the NHS of £1,000 or more can be refused a new visa.’
