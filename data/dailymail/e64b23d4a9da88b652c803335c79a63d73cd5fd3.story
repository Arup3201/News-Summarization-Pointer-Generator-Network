Please save this bear: The spectacled bear, which lives in South America and is the real-life Paddington, is in danger of becoming extinct

They’re bears all right, and they come from darkest Peru — but they’re very seldom found on Paddington Station wearing a luggage label that says: ‘Please look after this bear. Thank you.’

Spectacled bears seem to be specially equipped for hard stares of the kind that Aunt Lucy taught Paddington — the children’s favourite, based on them, who’s now a movie superstar. Their eyes tend to be surrounded by pale or gingerish markings that exaggerate the facial expression.

These marks vary — you can tell one individual bear from another once you get to know them — and they often take the appearance of lavish spectacles, so they look like a bearish Elton John or Edna Everage.

They’re the only species of bear in South America, and they’re found all over the Andes wherever wild places have been allowed to remain: a range that goes from Peru to Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and (just) into Argentina.

The corner that links Colombia, Ecuador and Peru is where the best habitat remains. And the best bears.

When Michael Bond wrote the first Paddington stories, he had Paddington stowing away from darkest Africa. On learning there are no bears in Africa, he shifted the action to darkest Peru and put Paddington’s Aunt Lucy — his only known relative other than an uncle who gave him his hat — in a Home for Retired Bears in Lima, from where she shipped Paddington to England.

What Bond would not have known is that, today, Peru’s real-life Paddingtons are in danger. Spectacled bears have been classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Hunters, poachers and habitat destruction mean their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 or so just a few decades ago.

Which is a sad thing, for they are bears as eccentric as Paddington himself. They’re much more Teddy-like in appearance than the great bears from the north of our planet.

If you ever look at a black bear or a grizzly face to face, then from the side, you will have a very strange experience. Head on, it has the round friendly face of your childhood comforter: little snub of a nose, big warm eyes, and two daft ears that looks as if they had been stuck on as afterthoughts.

But in profile, the face isn’t flat and round and chubby after all: it has a long muzzle sticking sharply from its face, and it’s obviously full of teeth.

When a spectacled bear shows you its profile, though, it’s as if you are meeting your childhood Teddy for real, octupled in size.

Pandas apart, there are two types of bears in the world. The fierce-looking, long-muzzled group, and a short-faced variety — of which the only surviving species in the world is the spectacled bear.

So if Bond was seeking the Teddiest kind of bear, he couldn’t have chosen better.

Not that all short-faced bears were necessarily gentle. The long-extinct giant short-faced bear was able to look down on a man when on all fours and capable of standing 12ft high.

But the spectacled bear is just 3ft at the shoulder fully grown. Pandas apart, it is the least ferocious bear. Paddington’s favourite food was marmalade sandwiches: that’d be right up the spectacled bear’s tree.

They hardly touch meat. All bears (apart from the exclusively carnivorous polar bear) take a wide range of food, but spectacled bears are as close as bears get to being vegetarian.

They have powerful jaws, but that’s so they can eat tough, fibrous plants, not you. They go for cactus, palm heart, palm nuts and orchid bulbs, and they strip tree bark to get at the nutritious second layer.

They do take small mammals and birds, but catching them is not what they’re best at.

What they’re really good at is climbing. With front legs longer than back, non-retractable claws and a terrific grip, they are designed to live among the branches. Their best habitat is the cloud forest of the Andes, where they roam, content and solitary, high above the ground, only coming down when they choose.

They're the only species of bear in South America and found all over Andes but their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 in a few decades

They build platforms up there for rest: they’ve been seen camping out for days, waiting for the fruit to ripen and give them a great binge.

They love heights. They’ve been found at 14,000ft in the Andes and their heartland. But they’re adaptable: they can cope with grassland, dry forest and even semi-desert.

And as human populations grow, they’ve shown that they can adapt to farmland pretty well: though it’s yet to be shown that farmland can adapt to bears. But these bears are hard animals to get close to: they’re mainly nocturnal, preferring to keep out of the way of humans. When they do come up against people, they’re seldom aggressive unless you threaten them or their cubs.

There’s only one record of a human getting killed by a spectacled bear: it had been shot by hunters and was wounded and angry.

The bears are surrounded by threats from humans. The most serious is the destruction of habitat: only a small proportion of the once great Andean cloud forest remains. It’s been replaced by farmland, some of it illegal, but the bears can make a living here: maize cobs and sugar-cane are very acceptable to them.

Naturally, this sort of behaviour is resented. But what’s hated even more is the loss of cattle and horses.

When Michael Bond, creator of the Paddington bear series, first had the idea he had Paddington stowed away in Africa before he learned there are no bears in Africa and so chose Peru

It’s widely believed among local people that the bears kill them: even though killing large mammals is not their way. But when they find dead livestock, they will accept a protein bonanza.

So they get shot for things that they didn’t do. And there is money in it for the shooter — a bear’s gall bladder is valuable in the Chinese medicine trade and so are the paws.

So the life of the bear is complex and the future uncertain.

But there are some excellent conservation projects in place. One is an area of cloud forest that belongs to the Segundo y Cajas community in — where else? — darkest Peru.

It’s run by Naturaleza y Cultura Peru, with support from the British-based World Land Trust. Here there is important work on looking after the cloud forest and its inhabitants. And the spectacled bear is probably the star.

Paddington Bear is voiced by British actor Ben Whishaw, in the new computer-generated big-screen movie

Following a terrible earthquake, Paddington is sent across the high seas and eventually finds himself on a platform at Paddington station with a label round his neck, imploring some kind stranger to look after him

But it’s not vastly well-known. It has always lived in obscurity, and it’s possible it will die out in the same way.

Unless we do something about it (and one way to do that is to support the World Land Trust). Here we have a fascinating beast whose life is being compromised by the relentless pressure exerted by humans. Like so many others.

And because of this, I sometimes feel myself transported back to the Paddington Station of my childhood, but there is no longer just one small bear looking for protection.

No: I seem to see the station packed with animals, the spectacled bear among them, each one wearing a luggage label that reads: please look after this bear, this rhino, this tiger, this whale, this eagle, this frog, this shark, on and on across the platforms endless rows and ranks of animals that desperately need our protection.

Please look after this bear. Please look after this planet. Thank you.
