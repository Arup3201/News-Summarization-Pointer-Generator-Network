The nuptials will bring together European 
royals and top New York socialites for a grand celebration.

Madeleine, 30, is the youngest of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia's three children and fourth in line to the throne.

She became known as Sweden's party 
princess in her early 20s, when she was frequently spotted at 
Stockholm's high-end nightclubs, and has attracted widespread attention 
for her stylish clothes and glamorous lifestyle.

But her life hasn't always been a 
fairytale. In 2010, Madeleine fled to New York after breaking off her 
first engagement to Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid media reports 
that he had cheated on her.

The couple had been together for eight years
and had made a big announcement of their engagement in August the year 
before.

Since then, Madeleine has lived in New York, working for the nonprofit World Childhood Foundation, founded by her mother.

Two years ago, she met O'Neill, now 38, who works as a partner and head of research at Noster Capital.

This time around the princess has 
kept a lower profile, announcing their engagement through a video on the
Royal Court's website.

Princess Tatiana of Greece and Prince Nikolaos attended the dinner. The nuptials will include a private wedding reception with an estimated 500 guests

Jenny Alexandersson, the royal 
reporter at Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, says the breakup with Bergstrom
had been 'really, really hard' for Madeleine.

'She was really sad, and I think she 
felt a bit humiliated,' Alexandersson told The Associated Press. 'So, 
this time I really hope it's a big love.

'They look really, really happy 
together so I'm crossing my fingers for them.'

The Royal Court on Friday said 
Madeleine's wedding dress has been made by Italian designer Valentino 
Garavani.

Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg and Her Royal Highness Princess Stephanie of Luxembourg were among the slew of guests for the dinner. Officials say that no side events for the general public have been arranged this time for the wedding

Alexandersson said she expects a glamorous ceremony, adding 
that O'Neill has invited many friends from his party days among the New 
York glitterati.

The Royal Court said guests include 
the UK's Earl and Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward and Sophie, Princess
Takamado of Japan and princes and princesses from Norway, Denmark, 
Greece, Luxembourg and Monaco.

Other well-known invites include the 
CEO of fashion retailer H&M, Karl-Johan Persson, golfer Jesper 
Parnevik, Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson, Broadway's 'Phantom of the 
Opera' star Peter Joback and Colombian billionaire Alejandro Santo 
Domingo.

Happy couple: Princess Madeleine announced her engagement to Mr O'Neill in October last year

Although Madeleine's wedding will be a
lavish affair, it won't compare to her sister Crown Princess Victoria's
marriage to her personal trainer Daniel Westling in 2010.

Then 
Stockholm was transformed into one giant party for citizens and royals 
alike.

Officials say that no side events for
the general public have been arranged this time.

Bbut Swedes can watch 
the royal couple's meander through the capital in a horse and carriage 
after the wedding ceremony in the Royal Chapel.

Then, the couple will 
sail to the royal residence and UNESCO World Heritage site Drottningholm
Palace, 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the city center, for a private 
wedding reception with an estimated 500 guests.

O'Neill was born into a wealthy 
family. His late father, Paul O'Neill, set up the European head office 
of Oppenheimer & Co in London in the 1960s and his mother, Eva Maria
O'Neill, is involved in several charities.

He studied at a boarding school in 
St. Gallen, Switzerland, and holds a bachelor's degree in international 
relations from Boston University and a master's degree from Columbia 
Business School in New York.

O'Neill, who holds dual American and 
British citizenship, has declined a royal rank in Sweden, which would 
have required him to become a Swedish citizen.

He has chosen to continue
working and the newlyweds are expected to move back to the United 
States.

The Swedish royal family has only 
ceremonial duties, such as attending award ceremonies, promoting Swedish
businesses abroad and supporting charities.

As the head of state, the 
king also receives foreign dignitaries on formal visits to Sweden.
