Locked-in sufferers, who are fully conscious but completely paralysed, could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones.

The breakthrough follows the development of two portable 'mind readers' that combine the use of vibrating pads and an electrode cap to measure a patient's brain signals.

Scientists say these could help prevent people being misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative state, when in reality they can understand everything going on around them.

Up until now, huge fMRI scanners were one of the only hope for locked-in patients to communicate, according to a report by Clare Wilson in the New Scientist.

Previous tests had shown success in communicating with people in a locked-in state by concentrating on the specific words, 'yes' or 'no' while inside the scanner.

By studying their brain activity using electrodes, researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers.

Adrian Owen of Western University in London, Canada, has been developing a system that involves placing vibrating pads on someone's arm, and then asking them to focus on one vibrator.

The idea is that paying attention to a sense-like vibration creates electrical signals in the brain that are much easier to read than eye movements.

Locked-in sufferers, who are fully conscious but completely paralysed, could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones. Pictured is an example of how the brain lights up when someone with locked in syndrome reacts to the question 'are you married?'

Last year, a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state was able to follow the plot of a short Hitchcock film.

Doctors believed the 34-year-old Canadian was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago.

But scans taken while the patient was shown 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' revealed brain activity linked to feelings of anticipation and excitement.

The brain patterns resembled that of healthy participants, suggesting not only that the patient was consciously aware, but also that he understood the film.

'For the first time, we show that a patient with unknown levels of consciousness can monitor and analyse information from their environment, in the same way as healthy individuals,' said Lorina Naci, a researcher at the University of Western Ontario.

'We already know that up to one in five of these patients are misdiagnosed as being unconscious and this new technique may reveal that that number is even higher.'

'Tactile stimulation works very well.' Professor Owen told New Scientist. 'We have had some successes.'

An Austrian company, called g.tec, has developed a similar system using vibrating pads on a patient's wrists and then measuring their brain waves.

According to the New Scientist, the University of Li√®ge in Belgium has successfully tested it on people with classic locked-in syndrome by asking them to count the vibrations felt.

By analysing their brain activity using electrodes, researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers.

Professor Owen's has previously shown that some people described as being in a 'vegetative state' could understand and follow instructions.

Several years ago, his team used fMRi to show that one in five people in vegetated states could think about playing tennis or walking around their home.

In September, a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state has been able to follow the plot of a short Hitchcock film.

Doctors believed the 34-year-old Canadian was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago.
