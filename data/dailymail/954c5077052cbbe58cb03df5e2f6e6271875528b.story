Residents heard a loud rumbling as a 3.3-magnitude earthquake rattled the border of Connecticut and Rhode Island this morning.

The U.S. Geological Survey has confirmed that the quake hit Plainfield, Killingly and Norwich in Connecticut, and Coventry and Providence in Rhode Island at 6.30am on Monday. 

State police in eastern Connecticut said they received several reports of homes shaking but there were no reports of damage or injuries. Residents reported loud explosions and the ground shaking.

'Wow that was scary,' one resident, Cindy from Sterling, told NBC. She said the entire house shook and 'not just a little either'.

A Moosup resident told the channel that the earthquake shook her house for four to five seconds. 

Plainfield police have sent officers throughout the town to ensure everyone is safety and are working with the fire marshal's office to update the public, the department said. 

It comes just days after an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.0 to 2.2 was felt in Plainfield on Thursday. Homeowners reported that it was strong enough to shake picture frames off the walls.

On Friday, residents reported another loud boom in the form of a tremor that registered at .4.

In total, the Plainfield area has experienced four small earthquakes since October, according to data collected by the Weston Observatory at Boston College, the Hartford Courant reported.

New England is no stranger to small earthquakes, which are felt in the area roughly twice a year, and it suffers moderate damage every few decades, according to the USGS.

The Weston Observatory recorded fewer than 40 earthquakes per year between 1990 and 2005. But there were 80 in 2006, 94 in 2010, 154 in 2011 and 182 in 2012.

John E. Ebel, the chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Boston College, told the Courant that the quakes have occured naturally and are not associated with fracking. 

The largest known New England earthquakes shook Vermont and New Hampshire in 1638 (a magnitude 6.5 earthquake), and in 1755, when a 5.8-magnitude quake hit offshore from Cape Ann northeast of Boston, causing severe damage to the city's waterfront.

More recently, a 5.6-magnitude quake caused 'moderate damage' in 1940 in central New Hampshire, the USGS said.

While scientists can often determine the name of the specific fault line responsible for earthquakes in well-studied areas like California, on the east coast, it is much trickier, according to the agency.

New England is laced with numerous small or deeply buried faults, and many remain undetected, making it hard to know exactly which faults are responsible for an earthquake.
