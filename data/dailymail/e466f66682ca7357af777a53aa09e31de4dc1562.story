They are top of La Liga, reigning Champions League winners and have qualified for the knockout stages of this season's tournament with two group games remaining. 

And now, Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid side have been voted the best Madrid team in the history of the club by 20,000 Marca readers.

They received 35 per cent of the poll, seven per cent more than the galacticos and 10 per cent more than the team that lifted the European Cup an astonishing five times.

This Real Madrid side have been voted the best one in the club's history after a poll carried out by Marca

Carlo Ancelotti's (above) team are the holders of the Champions League and currently top of La Liga

But the vote won't make pleasant reading for Jose Mourinho, as his Real Madrid team only received five per cent.

That wasn't the lowest, though. The legendary Madrid side of the 1960's only had one per cent of the final poll.

With Ancelotti's side welcoming Gareth Bale back from injury and back into an attack that already includes Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, it is difficult to see  the end of the possibilities for what this side could achieve.
