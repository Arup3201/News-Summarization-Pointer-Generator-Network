Response: French foreign minister Laurent Fabius has promised a tough response should Syria use chemical or biological weapons

Western countries are preparing a fierce response after claims Syrian leader President Bashar Assad could deploy chemical or biological weapons if the conflict-ravaged country is attacked.

Syria's leadership has said the country, which is believed to have nerve agents as well as mustard gas and Scud missiles capable of delivering lethal chemicals, could use chemical or biological weapons if it were attacked from outside.

Now after Barack Obama described Assad's possible use of chemical weapons as a 'red line', France has also promised a tough response on the issue.

Speaking on RMC radio Monday, French 
Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said 'we are discussing this notably 
with our American and English partners.' If Syria uses such weapons, 
'our response ... would be massive and blistering,' he said.

Fabius added that Russia and China 
are 'of the same position,' but acknowledged frustration at their 
continuing support for Assad. 

The foreign ministries of both China and Russia declined immediate comment on Monday.

Since the start of the Syrian 
conflict, Beijing has been consistent in its stance that it should be 
settled through negotiations and not by outside forces.

Moscow is Syria's chief ally, and 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov told the AP in a recent 
interview that Russia has the Syrian government's assurances that 
chemical weapons will not be used. Gatilov said Russia will 'work toward
the goal of preventing such things from happening.'

China and Russia have repeatedly used 
their veto powers in the U.N. Security Council to block U.S.- and 
Arab-backed action that could have led to sanctions against Assad's 
regime.

Syria's opposition has urged outside military help against Assad's armed forces.

Trail of destruction: As the conflict in Syria 
drags on, aid agencies monitoring the violence now report the deaths of 
100 to 250 or more Syrians on daily basis, though the figures are 
impossible to independently verify

'I am going to be very clear, we are requesting military intervention in order to protect Syrian civilians who have constantly murdered over the last year and a half,' the head of the Syrian National Council, Abdelbaset Sieda, said in Madrid on Monday.

'The European Union should take the initiative and pressure Russia ... so we can lay down some protected areas for refugees,' Sieda said after meeting Spain's Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo.

Margallo said Spain would continue to press for a united EU approach to Syria and urged Syrian opposition groups to overcome their divisions and join together against the Assad regime.

The new U.N. envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, acknowledged Monday that brokering an end to the civil war is a 'very, very difficult task.'
