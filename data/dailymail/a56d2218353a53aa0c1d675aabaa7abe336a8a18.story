A nurse with a gun stopped a gang of black men from attacking a white driver in Detroit who had gotten out of his car to help the child he had accidentally hit.

Deborah Hughes saw a gang forming around Steve Utash last week as she peered out her window and knew that there would be trouble.

'Always when I see a crowd like that and stuff like that I put my gun in my jacket pocket and I go to see what's going on,' she told MyFoxDetroit.

Heroic: The Detroit Police Chief said that Deborah Hughes (pictured) saved Steve Utash's life by running in to break up the violence as he was being attacked by a mob on April 2

Scene: Ms Hughes lives across the street from this gas station in suburban Detroit where the attack took place on April 2 that has left Steve Utash in critical condition

Taking action: Ms Hughes said that she always carries a pistol with her when she sees trouble brewing

'I laid over the top of him, I put my arms around him and I said "You are safe. Nobody's going to hurt you no more."'

Ms Hughes, a nurse, has been praised by Detroit Police Chief James Craig and thanked by Mr Utash's family.

She met with his relatives while he remains in critical condition from the injuries he sustained in the April 2 beating.

'I go over there and I say, "Don't nobody else hit him. Don't put your hands on him. Leave him alone!" And everybody backed up and let me go to work on your dad,' she told them, according to WDIV Detroit.

She said he was unconscious and 'wasn't doing anything' by the time she got to his side.

'Just her presence, offering aid to this gentleman, may have saved his life,' Chief Craig told the station.

Ms Hughes has spoken out on the same day that a fifth man has been arrested for his involvement in attacking the 54-year-old tree trimmer from Clinton Township.

Police have not released the person's name, age or any other details.

Three of the five: From left, Wonzey Saffold, 30, James Davis, 24, and Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17, were all charged in the beating and now two others have also been arrested

Arraignments were Tuesday for 17-year-old Bruce Wimbush Jr., 30-year-old Wonzey Saffold and 24-year-old James Davis.

They're charged with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to commit great bodily harm.

A 16-year-old boy also faces a hearing Saturday.

Steve Utash's son Joseph previously hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime.

'I think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same company... they know he has money and they robbed him.

'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.'

Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified

Police initially said a group of at least six people descended on Utash, a tree-trimmer.

Sgt. Michael Woody said Monday that investigators are 'not trying to stick to one specific number' as they receive more tips and other information.

'We wouldn't have been able to get as far as we have' without help from the public, Woody said, though he added, 'We're not done yet. We're still very much at the beginning stages of this case.'

The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.'

A prominent black minister, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, had said Saturday that it was important for community members 'to prove that we equally deplore justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the victim is or of the one committing it.'

In
 Michigan, ethnic intimidation is a felony that carries a possible 
two-year prison sentence.

Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street

On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit

Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement Monday that the case is 'unbelievably tragic,' but declined further comment 'because this investigation is continuing and widening.'

Security footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed down by Utash's vehicle.

Utash, from suburban Roseville, immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene.

Police quickly ruled the incident an accident.

'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained.
