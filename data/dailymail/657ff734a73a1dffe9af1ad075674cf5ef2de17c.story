A bidding war on eBay has reached over $100,000 as Apple fans clamour to buy what a seller claims to be a prototype of the iPhone 6.

The handset is running prototype software it is believed Apple uses to test phones, rather than the iOS 8 software the final version runs.

The seller, a users called kimberlyk1018, says the handset was sent by accident.

The handset is running special software called switchboard Apple uses to test its devices before they go on sale.

The original codename for the iPhone at apple was Purple.

However, to stop even those working on the project from seeing all of it, a rough tablet like gadget was created that plugged inot a Mac computer, so engineers could work of the software without knowing what the phone would look like.

Accord to fast.co, this was dubbed the skankphone. 

The seller is giving a '110% guarantee on this being an authentic Apple prototype device'. 

'For sale is a brand new never used Apple iPhone 6 Prototype,' the listing says.. 

'Apple does NOT let these phones out of their possession yet I was accidentally sent one upon renewing my contract.'

'As you can see from the photos, iOS8 has not been placed on this device, rather it is in the true developer mode. 

'There are no FCC markings on the rear of the device or a model number. 

'This is the real deal!!! The lightening port is red which is a sure sign of a prototype. 

CNET tracked down the seller, called Alex Kantor. 

'I determined that this iPhone was a version not meant for the consumer market after seeing the software version on it,' he said.

'I am an avid tech lover and I knew what this software was right away. 

'It is actually called SwitchBoard and is only for internal Apple testing,' Kantor said.

The handset has a red label covering its Lightning port, and has none of the logos or serial numbers found on a production iPhone 6.

'This device is being sold as is. 

'I cannot guarantee that it will make calls or that the camera will work,' tyhe seller admits.

'This is a once in a life time opportunity for you to take a part of.
