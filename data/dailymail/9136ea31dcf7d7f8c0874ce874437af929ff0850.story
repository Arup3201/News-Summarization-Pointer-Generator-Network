This time of year is traditionally one of the busiest. 

Christmas is creeping closer by the day and parents don't need reminding that the holiday season is fast approaching. 

To add to all the madness, each year parents are increasingly feeling the pressure to find the perfect gift for their child. 

As a result researching and shopping for Christmas is taking up five times more time than celebrating the actual event, a PayPal research reveals.

With that in mind, online auction and shopping website eBay have also released their list of top 10 predictions of the bestselling toys this Christmas with Disney's Frozen-themed collectables unsurprisingly being the most in demand.
