Martin McGuinness has said he and Ian Paisley 'pointed the way to a better future' for Northern Ireland as he signed a book of condolence for his former arch-enemy.

The pair buried decades of hostility for good when they took office together in 2007, and their friendship became such a symbol of the peace effort that they were dubbed the Chuckle Brothers.

Signing a book of condolence today for the famed Unionist firebrand, who died aged 88 yesterday after a long illness, the Deputy First Minister wrote: 'In rising above old enmities, we pointed the way to a better and peaceful future.

Tribute: Martin McGuinness signed a book of condolence today for his former arch rival Dr Ian Paisley

Symbolic: Despite being on opposing sides during the Troubles, the pair formed a lasting friendship in office

'The peace process and I have lost a friend.'

It came after former IRA commander Mr McGuinness led tributes to his former enemy this weekend, saying: 'I have lost a friend'.

The only hint of past disagreement came in the address column, which Mr McGuinness signed as Derry City. Although legally known as Londonderry, the debate over what to call Northern Ireland's second city was for decades symbolic of the schism between supporters and opponents of Westminster rule.

In 2007 the local authority, whose legal name is Derry City Council, lost a judicial review to change the name of the city and county to Derry permanently.

Lasting peace: The message said the pair had 'pointed the way to a better and peaceful future'

Before serving as First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2007 to 2008, Dr Paisley - once renowned as a symbol of hard-line Unionism - became crucial in forging the peace process and bringing an end to conflict in the province. 

The bellicose symbol of unionist defiance was famous for bellowing 'never, never, never' during a mass protest against Irish government involvement in Northern Ireland affairs in the 1980s.

But in a mark of his status as an unlikely symbol of reconciliation, his death was mourned by nationalists including Mr McGuinness and Sinn Fein's president Gerry Adams, who said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news. 

Others described him as a 'big man with a big heart', who despite his abrasive character and fiercely-held views will be remembered as a key figure in bringing peace.

Prime Minister David Cameron added Paisley would be remembered as the 'Big Man' of Northern Ireland politics. 

Dr Paisley entered government with republicans in 2007 as Stormont's First Minister after republicans lent their support to the police. 

He was known as Lord Bannside after joining the House of Lords in 2010, following his career as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party from 1971 until 2008. 

His wife Baroness Eileen Paisley said yesterday: 'My beloved husband, Ian, entered his eternal rest this morning.

'Although ours is the grand hope of reunion, naturally as a family we are heartbroken.'

Tribute: Mr McGuinness described his former fierce rival as a 'friend' in a statement on Twitter yesterday

Prime Minister David Cameron said Dr Paisley was a controversial figure for large parts of his career - 'yet the contribution he made in his later years to political stability in Northern Ireland was huge'.

'In particular, his decision to take his party into government with Sinn Fein in 2007 required great courage and leadership, for which everyone in these islands should be grateful.'

Former prime ministers Tony Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, plus current DUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, also paid tribute.

Dr Paisley was treated in hospital in the past, including in 2012 for an unspecified heart problem.

His funeral will be private, but a public memorial event will be held later this year.
