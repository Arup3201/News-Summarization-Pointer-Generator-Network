The playoffs may pay off for Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito, even from the sideline.

Incognito will remain on the NFL's suspended list with pay for the rest of the season, including the playoffs, a person familiar with the situation said Monday.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the bullying scandal that led to Incognito's suspension remains under investigation. The person said Incognito would be in line for a playoff share.

'Bully': Richie Incognito is accused of bullying teammate Jonathan Martin, including using racial slurs and threatening his family

Victim: Lineman Jonathan Martin left the team in October after claiming he was bullied by fellow teammates, including Incognito

Coach Joe Philbin declined to comment, but the Dolphins released a one-sentence statement saying the team and Incognito had agreed to 'maintain his suspension' during the investigation. Incognito's agent didn't respond to requests for comment.

The veteran guard is in the final year of a contract with a 2013 base salary of $3.5 million, or $220,588 per game.

Incognito was suspended Nov. 3 in the wake of the bullying scandal. He filed a grievance Nov. 14 against the Dolphins seeking to rejoin the team, but later withdrew it.

Tackle Jonathan Martin left the Dolphins on Oct. 28 and alleged he was harassed daily by teammates, including Incognito. NFL special investigator Ted Wells has interviewed Incognito, Martin, other players and coaches and will file a report.

Miami put Martin on the reserve/non-football illness list Nov. 30, ending his season.

The Dolphins (8-6), who beat AFC East leader New England on Sunday, are 5-2 since Martin left the team and 4-2 without Incognito. They'll earn a wild-card playoff berth if they sweep their final two games.

Leader: Quarterback Ryan Tannehill praised his team's resilience in the wake of the bullying scandal

Following the latest win, quarterback Ryan Tannehill praised the team's resilience in the wake of the scandal.

'We are fighters,' he said. 'We've been through a lot. Guys are tough and are able to handle anything that happens on the field.'
