Squashed into a child’s rubber dinghy floating precariously in the English Channel, a suspected illegal immigrant stretches out a paddle to his rescuers.

The man and a companion, believed to be from Pakistan, were apparently dropped off by a sailing yacht in the world’s busiest shipping lanes half a mile from the Kent coast.

Having squeezed themselves into the toy inflatable, the pair drifted in the dangerous waters until they caught the attention of a passing tourist boat.

Inflatable dinghy: The two men from Pakistan had to be rescued by lifeboat crew as they drifted across some of the world's busiest shipping lanes, threatened with being run over by heavy cargo tankers and ferries

Caught on camera: The pictures and video were taken by staff of the Dover Sea Safari which runs sea trips in the area

Helped: Pictures showed one of the men, dressed in a white T-shirt, already taken to safety on the RNLI crew's Rib (rigid inflatable boat) and the other still in the tiny blue dinghy, being rescued

Its skipper summoned an RNLI lifeboat 
crew who pulled the men to safety and took them to Dover, where they 
were detained by immigration officials.

The
 incident came days after eight Afghans were rescued from a broken-down 
inflatable in the Channel when a P&O ferry spotted them.

Yesterday,
 an MP voiced fears that  people will die attempting to reach  Britain 
unless French authorities send the hundreds of would-be immigrants 
camped in Calais back to their home countries.

Video
 filmed from the pleasure boat that raised the alarm on Tuesday 
afternoon shows one of the men sitting in the tiny boat with a small bag
 between his legs. He reaches out a blue plastic paddle to the RNLI crew
 and is hauled out. A second man has already been rescued and is seated 
at the front of the lifeboat wearing a white T-shirt.

The
 footage also captured the small two-masted yacht that is believed to 
have dropped off the pair, with a man in a dark jacket and hooded top at
 the helm.

James Salmon, 42, a skipper with pleasure cruise firm Dover Sea Safari, had 12 passengers on board when he saw the dinghy.

He
 said: ‘It was about 3.15pm and we were heading back from Deal towards 
Dover when we spotted two guys waving their paddles and shouting for 
help.

Response: The two men were taken to Dover by the Walmer RNLI crew where they were handed over to Border Force staff

On shore: The two men (wearing orange lifejackets) walk along in Kent with a group of police officers

Helped by the emergency services: The two men are checked over by paramedics while police watch

‘They were about half a
 mile from shore. They knew how to say “help” but that’s all they really
 said. We approached them and noticed they were of foreign origin, so we
 radioed Dover Coastguard and were asked to make sure they were safe and
 well. A lifeboat arrived about five minutes later and brought them back
 to shore.’

Mr Salmon 
expressed concerns about the dangers to would-be immigrants attempting 
to cross the Channel, which is used by hundreds of vast cargo ships and 
large passenger ferries every day.

He
 said: ‘The inflatable was tiny, like a two-man boat. We were 
astonished. They appeared to have travelled by yacht up to a couple of 
miles from shore and then they must have been dropped off and paddled 
from there. This seems to be the new way of doing it.

‘They
 were absolutely desperate to get across the Channel,  but it’s the 
busiest shipping lane in the world and their lives were in danger.’

The
 RNLI crew, from Walmer, took the two men to Dover where they received 
medical checks before being handed to Border Force staff. Charlie 
Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said yesterday: ‘This 
highlights the importance of the French getting a grip of the problem.

‘In
 particular, they should  repatriate people at Calais back  to their 
home countries as soon  as possible. These dinghies are unsafe craft and
 are not suitable for crossing the Channel. I am deeply concerned about 
the risk of loss of life.’

A
 spokesman for the UK’s  Border Force said: ‘Officers were alerted to 
two suspected illegal entrants who were rescued by the RNLI off the 
coast of Kent.

‘Both individuals are believed to be Pakistani nationals and have been detained while further investigations take place.’

Off the Kent coast: It is thought they may have been helped by other people amid reports the dinghy was dropped from a yacht which had already sailed some of the journey between France and England

Location: The incident happened off the coast of Walmer (file picture). The two men were taken to Dover by the Walmer RNLI crew where they were handed over to Border Force staff

Immigrants gathered in Calais are becoming increasingly desperate to cross the Channel to England to claim asylum.

'This seems to be the new way of doing it. They were absolutely desperate to get across the Channel but it's the busiest shipping lane in the world and their lives were in danger'

James Salmon, Dover Sea Safari

It follows a crackdown by authorities in Calais who are clearing unofficial immigrant camps in the town.

Last Saturday eight Afghan immigrants had to be rescued around five miles off the port of Dover in the Channel when their RIB's motor broke down after running out of fuel.

The alarm was raised by the captain of a passing P&O ferry which could have run them over. They were rescued from the choppy seas by Dover Lifeboat workers.

Romanian Marian Badea, 29, a ninth man who was in the boat with them, was charged with attempted facilitation. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court next week.

The eight Afghan nationals who were detained following the rescue are to be deported, said a spokesman for the Border Force.
