Could Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter lead Europe out on the first morning of the Ryder Cup? That would create some noise among the spectators gathered in the wonderful amphitheatre that has been created around the first tee, wouldn’t it?

McIlroy and Poulter were the fourballs partnership that changed everything at Medinah, of course, but Europe captain Paul McGinley will be all too aware of the perils associated with such a pairing as well.

It might be a decade ago but nobody as steeped in Ryder Cup lore as the Irishman will forget what happened when the Americans paired Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in 2004. When they were beaten comfortably it was such a psychological blow it set the tone for a record-breaking defeat.

Imagine what a boost it would give the visitors if a US partnership took down that talismanic pairing? A move that’s not without risk for McGinley, therefore, but one he appears to be leaning towards. One of those where you look like a genius if it works and get pilloried if it doesn’t.

Two partnerships seem fairly set for the opening morning. Near neighbours Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose will almost certainly be partners, as will Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson. Two more players whose form this season warrants action on the first morning are Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer.

Why not those two great mates Poulter and Rose? They are at their best in foursomes and will team up in the afternoon. The Americans? Again, two partnerships are cast in stone. Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson and Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson will see action.

Who plays with Rickie Fowler is the big question and Jordan Spieth, at 20 the youngest player on either team, would be an exciting answer. If that goes well you could see the two of them playing all five matches. Veteran Jim Furyk would be a prosaic alternative, with Matt Kuchar and one of the rookies — Jimmy Walker or Patrick Reed — completing the morning line-up.

By all means, play the game yourself at home. It’s Ryder Cup week. Everyone can join in.

How do you counter all the songs of the European fans who will gather from first light around the first tee? The American players are hoping their supporters will follow the lead of their ‘soccer’ fans at the World Cup and adopt the chant: ‘We believe that we can win.’ American captain Tom Watson said: ‘There will be some noise out there.’ Yes there will. But it’s hard to see the Americans, who don’t really go in for singing, getting much of a look in.

How Paul McGinley performs at the Ryder Cup could determine who is chosen as a  future European captain

VIDEO Pundits provide insight into potential pairings

When Paul McGinley was made Europe’s captain it marked a shift away from the recent tradition of skippers being either proven major winners or larger-than-life personalities. When Tom Watson was given the American equivalent, it ended the practice of the US captaincy being handed to distinguished former players whose careers had just come to a natural end.

The fate of the two incumbents this week, therefore, will go beyond the usual cartoonish portrayal that sees one depicted as Captain Fantastic and the loser as Captain Cock-up.

What happens at Gleneagles will go a long way to determining future captains on both sides. If Europe lose the clamour to turn the clock back and go for a Darren Clarke or a Padraig Harrington will be considerable. But if Europe win and McGinley plays a blinder, it will create a template and help considerably the chances of solid members of the tour citizenry like Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn.

America took a huge gamble with Watson. Knowing the players well, as McGinley does, is supposed to be a key part of the job but Watson will rule with brush strokes and rely on the respect he undoubtedly commands. How that works out could well determine whether his successor is another legend … or a McGinleyesque loyalist.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘I’ve made it very clear to my team that this is a redemption trip. It’s time for us to make amends for what happened at Medinah.’

American captain Tom Watson spells out his theme.

At Medinah last time it was the spirit of Seve that infused the European team. Here at Gleneagles Paul McGinley has ensured that popular coach Bob Torrance, his own mentor and someone who lent a guiding hand to so many before he passed away in July, will not be forgotten. Before any of his players left the practice range and went to the first tee at a tournament, Torrance would shake their hands and tell them: ‘Happiest days of your lives.’

Those are the last words any European player will see before he leaves the team room and makes his way to the first tee.
