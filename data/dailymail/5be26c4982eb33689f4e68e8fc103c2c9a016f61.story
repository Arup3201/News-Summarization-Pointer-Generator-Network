The national minimum wage is to rise by 20p an hour to £6.70, despite George Osborne suggesting last year it could hit £7.

The Low Pay Commission has recommended the increase to ministers, the largest real terms rise since 2007.

Ministers boasted it would take the hourly rate to its highest level in real terms since 2010, but it falls short of the idea it could hit £7 floated by the Chancellor a year ago.

The Low Pay Commission set out its recommendation for the main minimum wage rate to rise to £6.70 from October

The Commission recommends the adult rate should rise to £6.70 in October, while it would rise to £5.30  for 18-20-year-olds, £3.87 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.80 for apprentices.

In an interview in January last year, Mr Osborne suggested it could go higher. ‘If the minimum wage had kept in line with inflation it would be £7,' he said. 

‘Because we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’

The 20p rise is the largest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since 2007, and takes its real value three-quarters of the way back to its highest ever level.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This would represent an annual pay rise of £416 for a full time worker on the minimum wage. 

'If this recommendation were accepted, the value of the minimum wage would be higher than when we came to office in 2010 and we are now making good progress towards restoring the value it lost during the financial crisis.

'I will now study these recommendations and consult my Cabinet colleagues with a view to announcing the final rates in the next few weeks.' 

Mr Cable said the Low Pay Commission had to strike a 'delicate balance' between what is fair for workers and what is affordable for employers, without costing jobs.

'It does so impartially and without political interference. No government has ever rejected the main rates since it was established 15 years ago. It is important that it is able to continue to do its work 10 weeks before a general election.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the rise was the biggest real terms increase since 2010, but falls short of the £7 that Chancellor George Osborne (right) hinted at last year

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It is good that the minimum wage is set to go up more than average earnings, but if the recovery is really as strong and sustained as the Chancellor claims, the commission could have been braver and given Britain's lowest paid workers a bigger boost.

'We also need much bolder action to give those on the lowest pay a fair share of the recovery, including new modern wages councils to set higher minimum rates in industries where employers can afford to pay more.'

Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, said: 'The LPC has struck a careful balance. As the economic recovery cements, the commission has reconciled a desire to reflect this in pay packets while recognising that productivity growth - the key to sustainable pay rises - remains weak.

'We welcome the commitment to review next year's rise if the improved business environment doesn't materialise.

'The national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of our time thanks to the independent recommendations of the commission, helping many low-paid workers without damaging their job prospects.

'Any artificial increase due to political expediency will help no one and ultimately damage one of the most successful government policies in recent years.'  

The Tories insisted the rise marked progress towards taking the minimum wage back to its pre-crash peak.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'We've said we want to see above inflation increases in the minimum wage in order to start restoring it back to its real term peak, so it's good news that the Low Pay Commission have recommended exactly that. 

This builds on last year's rise which was the first real terms rise since Labour's great recession.

'Backing work with a rising minimum wage, income tax cuts and welfare reform is a core part of our long term economic plan and this is only possible because of the difficult decisions we've taken to get the economy moving. 

'We'll now consider the LPC's recommendations in the usual way.'
