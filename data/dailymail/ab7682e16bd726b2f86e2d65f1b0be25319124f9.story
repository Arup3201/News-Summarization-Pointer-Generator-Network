Kate Moss, who enjoys trips to the party isle is campaigning against oil drilling off it's Mediterranean coast

The Spanish government has picked a fight with some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities after giving permission for an oil company to start prospecting off the coast of Ibiza.

Residents and regular visitors to the ‘party island’, such as Jade Jagger, Kate Moss, Sienna Miller and heiress Paris Hilton have all added their weight to stop the drilling.

The campaign has gathered momentum on social networking sites with each tweeting to their millions of followers.

Rapper P Diddy sent a picture of the campaign poster to his 9.5million followers and Miss Hilton has tweeted it six times to her 12.5million.

Miss Moss, who recently celebrated her 40th birthday, has signed a petition and sent it to her friends, while Miss Jagger is believed to be masterminding the resistance from a work trip in India.

In 2011 the Spanish government invited energy companies to bid for the right to explore an area less than a square mile off the coast of Valencia in order to drill for oil.

It claims the lease was granted to Cairn Energy by the previous administration and reversing the decision would mean a heft compensation claim from the company.

But protesters claim compensation would not have to be paid if it was proven the plan was environmentally unsound.

Singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, who is supporting the campaign, said: ‘I know Ibiza is perceived as a party island but this isn’t just a social issue; it’s environmental, and on our conscience if we don’t act.

‘Now it’s time for us to say enough is enough.’

Cairn Energy, which is understood to be taking seismic measurements from a Cairn Energy, which is understood to be taking seismic measurements from a boat, declined to comment.
