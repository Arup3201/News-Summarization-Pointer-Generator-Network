Women, highly educated, divorced and rich people are more likely to die from assisted suicide, new research has revealed.

Researchers in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is legal, found that of people helped by right-to-die organisations such as Dignitas, around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause. 

They say this indicates that an increasing number of people may simply becoming 'weary of life'.

The research, published online in the International Journal of Epidemiology – 
that shows assisted suicide is more common in women, the divorced, those
 living alone, the more educated, those with no religious affiliation, 
and those from wealthier areas.

A 
previous study of suicides by two right-to-die organizations showed that
 25 per cent of those assisted had no fatal illness, instead citing 'weariness 
of life' as a factor.

In this study, researchers from the University of Bern looked at anonymous data on 1,301 cases
 of assisted suicide between 2003 and 2008, provided by three 
right-to-die organisations.

In 84 per cent of cases, the death 
certificates listed at least one underlying cause of death.

In the age 
group, 25-64 years the majority had cancer (57 per cent), followed by diseases 
of the nervous system (21 per cent).

Eleven people had a mood disorder 
listed as the first underlying cause, and three had another mental or 
behavioural disorder.

Religious affiliation appeared to influence whether a person opted for assisted suicide. Religion was another key factor. People of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than Roman Catholics. (Pope Francis is pictured)

For all causes, except Parkinson's disease, the 
percentage of assisted suicides was higher in women than men.

In the 
65-94 years age group, cancer was again the most common underlying cause
 (41 per cent), followed by circulatory (15 per cent) and diseases of the nervous system
 (11 per cent).

Thirty people had a mood disorder, and six had another mental or
 behavioural disorder.

The rate was also higher in urban 
compared to rural areas, in wealthier neighbourhoods, and in the French 
rather than German or Italian speaking areas of the country.

Younger people who had children were less likely to opt for assisted suicide in younger
 people, but not older people.

Religion was another key factor.  People of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than Roman Catholics, The Times reported.

Divorcees and people who live alone are also 50 per cent more likely to choose assisted suicide, researchers found

Those living alone or divorced were 50 per cent more likely to choose it.

Lead researcher Professor Matthias Egger said: 'The higher rates among the better educated and those living in 
neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic standing does not support the 
'slippery slope' argument but might reflect inequities in access to 
assisted suicide.

On the other hand, we found a higher rate among people
 living alone and the divorced. Social isolation and loneliness are well
 known risk factors for non-assisted suicides and our results suggest 
that they may also play a role in assisted suicide.

'Also, the 
observation that women die more frequently by assisted suicide than men 
is potentially of concern. Interestingly, though, studies from the 
Netherlands and Oregon in the USA reported more men than women among 
assisted deaths.'

Last year, the European Court of Human Rights asked 
Switzerland to clarify whether and under what conditions individuals not
 suffering from terminal illnesses should have access to help in ending 
their lives, suggesting that Switzerland should more precisely regulate 
assisted dying.

While euthanasia is prohibited in Switzerland, the penal code states 
that assisted suicide is legal if no selfish interests are involved.

Assisted
 suicides in Switzerland involve volunteers working for 'right-to-die' associations. The role of physicians is restricted to assessing the 
decisional capacity of the person requesting assistance and to 
prescribing the lethal drug.

Notably, the person requesting assistance 
does not need to have a terminal illness.

Dr Egger added that future deaths in right-to-die clinics must be registered so that suicide trends must be monitored.
