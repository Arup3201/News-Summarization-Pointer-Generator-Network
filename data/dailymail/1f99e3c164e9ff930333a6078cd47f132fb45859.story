Customers who couldn't 'Say Cheese' in a broken photo booth during a birthday party at an Ohio Chuck E. Cheese's brutally attacked employees at the place 'Where A Kid Can Be A Kid.'

During the incident on Sunday night in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, five men began to attack because one of them felt the manager didn't respond quickly enough to a complaint about the booth.

Six employees (including the manager) were injured in the attack and brought to the hospital.

Customers at a Chuck E. Cheese's in Ohio attacked six employees after a photo booth wouldn't work 

At least five men carried out the attack while a dozen members of the birthday party they were at cheered 

A warning was sent out over the restaurant's sound system telling customers to evacuate during the attack

The brawl started when one of the men from the party followed the manager into the kitchen and threatened to kill him, WOIO reported. 

During the subsequent attack, the manager was punched in the face and beaten on the head.

When employees attempted to stop the beating, they were attacked by other members of the birthday party group.  

While the attacks were going on, at least 12 other people from the party were encouraging the men to continue the bloody brawl. 

Lt. Kevin Riley, the Parma Police Department public information officer, told Daily Mail Online the incident was 'a violent, vicious and unprovoked attack on adults and juveniles who were just doing their jobs'.

A female employee under the age of 18, Andrea Davis, was hit in the face when she tried to call 911. 

The attack happened on Sunday night at a Chuck E. Cheese's in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, Ohio 

After the attack was over, an employee walked back into the kitchen and held his face where he'd been hit

On Sunday, March 8, at approximately 7:10 pm, five individuals entered the kitchen of our Parma restaurant and launched an unprovoked attack on our General Manager. During the incident, five additional employees were injured. All were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and released. The individuals involved all fled the scene prior to police arriving.

We are anxious to bring these individuals to justice and are actively working with Parma police to provide information that will lead to their arrest.

We take any incident in our stores very seriously and have spent more than $15 million to date on measures to help ensure the safety of our guests.

Another employee was able to get through to the emergency line and reported seeing coworkers covered in blood, Fox 8 News reported. 

Davis said: 'I get to 9...1... and I just get slammed. I am in a full fight. This dude came out of nowhere.

'Half of them were cheering him on, the other half were screaming. 

Their children and grandchildren were running around while we were fighting and they don't know what's going on and there's blood everywhere.'

The brawl, which happened in the kitchen as well as the main area of the restaurant, was captured on surveillance video. 

A warning was sent out over the restaurant's sound system and customers were told to evacuate.

All of the suspects fled before authorities arrived on the scene.

Police are continuing to investigate the incident 

Lt. Riley said Tuesday police have a number of leads and hope to make arrests soon. 

He said: 'We have several detectives actively pursuing leads at this time. 

'We hope to have a resolution to this case sometime in the near future.' 

According to the company's website: 'Chuck E. Cheese’s is the ultimate place Where A Kid Can Be A Kid and parents can enjoy every moment. 

'That’s why Chuck E. himself takes pride in providing a safe, family-friendly environment that kids and parents will love coming back to.'
