As Paris   picks up the pieces of a city torn apart by the deadly terrorist attacks two weeks ago, three words remain in people's minds - Je suis Charlie.

Following the deaths of 12 people in the siege on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the slogan has been a symbol of support for freedom of speech.

In the wake of the tragedy,  artists have used the walls of the city as a canvas to serve as a constant reminder to the magazine's survivors that they have the backing of Parisians.

Yesterday, today, tomorrow: Artists used the image of a pencil to represent the way Paris and Charlie Hebdo will bounce back from the attacks

It was not the first time the magazine's offices have been a target - in November 2011 the building was firebombed, destroying the Charlie Hebdo computer system.

The attack came after the publication ran an issue supposedly guest edited by Mohammed, containing cartoons of the Muslim prophet and the slogan: ‘100 lashes if you don’t die of laughter’.

The following week staff published a defiant issue. The front page showed a male cartoonist passionately kissing a Muslim man, with the headline. ‘L’amour plus fort que la haine’, meaning ‘love is stronger than hate’. 

The most recent edition of Charlie Hebdo featured a caricature of the prophet Mohammed on the cover. The magazine, which normally sells around 30,000 copies a week, had an initial unprecedented print run of three million, which was then increased.

Issues of the magazine  sold out across Paris news kiosks  within minutes.
