Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine

Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to lose the right to host the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. 

The Deputy Prime Minister has said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board the Malaysia Airlines flight.

World football governing body Fifa has this week rejected calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted.

The organisation has insisted the tournament could be 'a force for good.'

But Mr Clegg told The Sunday Times that allowing the tournament to go ahead in Russia without a change of course by president Vladimir Putin would make the world look 'so weak and so insincere' in its condemnation of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels. 

The EU has added another 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes and ambassadors in Brussels are expected to extend the punitive actions to state-owned banks' access to capital markets and to the arms and energy sectors.

Mr Clegg said however that sporting events should also be part of the package of measures - including the cancellation of Russia's first F1 Grand Prix, which is due to take place in Sochi in October.

Mr Clegg said the threat of withdrawing the World Cup would be 'a very potent political and symbolic sanction'.

'If there's one thing that Vladimir Putin cares about, as far as I can see, it's his sense of status.

'Maybe reminding him that you can't retain the same status in the world if you ignore the rest of the world, maybe that will have some effect on his thinking.'

He did not rule out the UK as an alternative host given its recent history of putting on successful global sporting events.

'We've got the stadiums, we've got the infrastructure, and we've got the public backing and enthusiasm to host it,' he said.

'That's a decision for other people. But I'm not saying this just as a, sort of, British land grab to snatch the World Cup from under Vladimir Putin's nose.'

Football's world governing body Fifa this week ruled out calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted, insisting the tournament could be 'a force for good

He backed David Cameron's criticism of a French deal to supply warships to Russia, saying it would be 'wholly inappropriate' for it to proceed in the present circumstances.

Paris has accused the Prime Minister of hypocrisy, with MPs questioning continued British military exports despite an embargo and donations to the Conservatives by wealthy Russians.

'Whilst I can entirely understand that the French may have entered into that contract with the Russians in entirely different circumstances, it is wholly inappropriate to go ahead with that now,' he said.

Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was 'beyond belief' that Russia should be allowed to host the 2018 World Cup

'And as you know, the Prime Minister has reviewed the outstanding licenses that we have got to make sure that we deliver what we unilaterally announced back in March, which was that there would be no exports from Britain of arms products which could in any way fuel or fan the flames of the conflict in Ukraine.'

He said he had been assured by Business Secretary Vince Cable that 'great care' was taken to check the remaining licences.

Half of voters polled by YouGov for the Sunday Times supported the idea of stripping Russia of the high-profile football (50 per cent) and motor-racing (51 per cent) events, with only 22 per cent opposed.

The call was also joined by former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman, who said it was 'beyond belief' that Mr Putin should be allowed to host the World Cup.

He said: 'When you look at the way he milked the Winter Olympics for all it was worth, there's no question he sees it for himself, and for his prestige, as a huge gain.

'The idea that the world should afford Russia that prestige is beyond belief.

'I don't know how many people have to get shot out of the skies before people say enough is enough.'

Pressure on Mr Cameron over Russian donations was added to by the widow of murdered spy Alexander Litvinenko, who said he should return the tennis cash.

Britain has denied that the announcement of a public inquiry into his death and possible Russian involvement - in a reversal of previous policy - was linked to efforts to turn the screw on Moscow.

Mrs Litvinenko told the newspaper: 'If David Cameron doesn't want to appear like he is being bought, I think he should return this money.'
