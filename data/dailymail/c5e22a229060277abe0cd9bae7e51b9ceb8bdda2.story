These cubs can bear-ly keep apart as they play-fight in Alaska.

The brown bears were caught on camera by wildlife photographer Senthil Palaniappun - who was located just 50 feet away from the tumble.

Mr Palaniappun, from Los Angeles, USA, said: 'We chanced upon a mum and her two cubs who were probably about eight or nine months old.

'As they were grazing one of the cubs suddenly started fighting the other. The mum didn't seem to care much, she kept going about her business but still kept just a short distance away.

'At times the cubs came reasonably close to me, maybe within about 50 feet.

'I believe they were playing but at the same time training for later territorial pursuits. The fight lasted on and off for about 30 minutes.

'I'm sure the mum and cubs knew we were there but at no point did we feel threatened or interfere with their activities. We kept our movement to a minimum so not to scare or spook them.'

Family feud: Even bears fight with their siblings as these images prove. But there was no love lost as the brown bears were only play-fighting

Biting fit: These little nippers bear their teeth - but luckily it's just a play-fight. The tussle was caught on camera by Senthil Palaniappun in the Katmai Peninsula in Alaska

The 39-year-old spotted the dramatic tussle during a trip to the Katmai Peninsula.

Their protective mum watched on until the cubs eventually ran out of steam after a gruelling half an hour. 

Katmai is one of the best places to see brown bears in the world.

About 2,200 brown bears are estimated to inhabit the park - which is more than the number of people who live on the Alaskan peninsula.
