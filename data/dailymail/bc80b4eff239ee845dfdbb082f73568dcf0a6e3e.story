They came for Kaka - and they did not leave disappointed.

The Brazilian scored a stoppage-time free kick to equalise for Orlando City after their opponents New York City had taken a late lead against the run of play.

Mix Diskerud almost ruined Orlando’s party when he curled an effort in on 76 minutes, but Kaka responded, after dominating the game, by scoring a 25-yard free kick via a heavy deflection.

It was the least they deserved after the home team had dominated most of the game as the MLS’s two newest sides went toe-to-toe in this showpiece event.

The city had been celebrating their new team all weekend ahead of the match; a festival atmosphere enveloping the place the day before and starting again with barbecues outside the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium well before the game.

Football is a team game, but this was very much about one man: Kaka.

Two teams were making their MLS debuts in front of a sold out 63,000-strong crowd, but the Brazilian, considered the greatest player on the planet in 2007, was playing the lead role. He did not let down his adoring fans.

His mere presence on the pitch whipped the striking purple crowd into a frenzy, from the moment he led the side out ahead of kick off for the very first time, introducing city to their new team.

It took only two minutes for him to make his mark. Just placing a ball for a free kick drew pandemonium around the Citrus Bowl, but he delivered a ball into the box which Seb Hines, on loan from Middlesbrough, headed inches wide of the left post.

The home side dominated, and Kaka was the catalyst for everything. He nudged the ball with his thigh, 12 minutes in, travelling outside the area with its momentum and hitting a left-foot shot just wide.

In the best chance of the half passes exchanged between Kaka, Lewis Neal and Kevin Molino and ended with the ball laying off for the main man to shoot first time, his powerful effort saved.

His $7,167,500 salary is mammoth, but so is the responsibility on his shoulders to carry the team.

He showed yet another example of what he will bring for that in the 23rd minute, picking the ball up 10 yards outside the area and turning quickly to change the direction of play to pass to Brek Shea free on the left, who shot narrowly over.

Two minutes later, the crowd were raising from their seats, straining to get a better look, as he drove forward with the ball on the left, tried to get in between two defenders then eventually got a shot away.

When Shea, formerly of Stoke, Barnsley and Birmingham, produced a 360 spin to beat an opponent, there was clearly a touch of Samba to his thinking.

This was not to forget that former Barcelona forward David Villa, another of the league’s newest stars, was making his debut for New York City where he will be teaming up with Frank Lampard when the Manchester City midfielder joins in the summer. But while Kaka took to the league straight away, Villa had a frustrating evening.

He was involved, however, when New York City almost took a surprise lead on the break after 67 minutes. For all Orlando City’s domination, their opponents broke from inside their own half and worked the ball quickly to Villa who passed into substitute Khiry Shelton. He shot hard a low across goal but just wide.

But they did go in front, in the 76th minute. Villa was involved again, passing to Mix Diskerud who took a touch and before curling an effort into the right of goal.

When Aurelin Collin was sent off late on for a two-footed lunge on Villa,it looked like for all Kaka’s efforts he would end his first game in America goalless and in defeat. But, like all great players, he produced when it mattered most.
