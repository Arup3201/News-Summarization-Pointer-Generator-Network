It's the moment any animal-lover would have their heart in their mouth – as a pink newborn panda cub disappears into its mother’s jaws.

But doting Qing Qing was carrying the cub just  as a new panda mother should – to the relief of keepers trying to keep the endangered species from extinction.

Gently does it: Caring Qing Qing delicately carries her tiny newborn cub in her mouth - just as a new panda mother should - much to the relief of zookeepers trying to keep the endangered species from extinction

Protected: The safest place for a newborn cub is in its mother's mouth. The as yet unnamed cub, born at the Bifengxia Protection Centre in Sichuan, China, on Friday, weighs just over 3oz - compared to mum's 19st

Expert Jeroen Jacobs said: ‘These pictures are very encouraging.

'First-time mothers can be disinterested, but Qing Qing knows what to do and is carrying her baby gently.

'The best place for the cub is in mother’s mouth where she can be protected.’

The as yet unnamed cub, born at the Bifengxia Protection Centre in Sichuan, China, on Friday, weighs just 3½oz – compared to mum’s 19st.

The birth will also bring some comfort to keepers who were mourning the death of five-year-old  Xin Xin from kidney failure last week.

Elsewhere in China, twin cubs were born last week to 11-year-old Yang Yang at a breeding centre in Shaanxi Province – but there are still just 370 giant pandas in captivity.
