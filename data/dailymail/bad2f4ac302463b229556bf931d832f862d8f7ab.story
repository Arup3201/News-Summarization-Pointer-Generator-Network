Swansea skipper Ashley Williams will make his 300th appearance for the club as manager Garry Monk brings back the senior guard for the Barclays Premier League visit of West Ham on Saturday.

Williams' central defensive partnership with Federico Fernandez will be restored after Monk named a makeshift team for the FA Cup victory at Tranmere.

Diafra Sakho has scored in seven of his 11 Premier League starts.
