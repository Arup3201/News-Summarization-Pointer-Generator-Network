Planning a last minute festive flight home this Christmas to see the family? You may want to avoid Luton or Stansted airports.

According to new figures, passengers flying from London  are most likely to suffer fight delays than anywhere else in the UK on the run up to Christmas.

Travel website flightcompensation.com has revealed a list of the worst offending airports for tardiness based on flight data from December 2013, with Luton and Stansted facing the most disruption a year ago.

A website has compiled a list of the worst UK airports  for delays based on data from December 2013

Luton came out top as the worst airport for delays over 15 minutes, followed by Stansted and Gatwick

Luton Airport was named the worst airport for Christmas flight delays  with the majority (56.61 per cent) of all flights that month being delayed by 15 minutes or more.

Not faring much better, Stansted came a close second with 54.9 per cent, followed by Gatwick with 54.27 per cent and Heathrow came at ninth with 31.84 per cent.

Manchester (42.28 per cent), Southampton (39.29 per cent) and Bournemouth (38.64 per cent) were also included in the top ten along with private airfield Northolt (50 per cent), Prestwick (35.44 per cent) and Nottingham East Midlands (31.84 per cent).

However, Northolt's place on the list is misleading as it had only two flights during all of December 2013, and one of the two was delayed.

Prestwick had 73  delayed flights over 15 minutes and Nottingham East Midlands had 306.

Flightcompensation.com has also revealed the the best airports to travel from if you don't want to be late. 

Southend, Cambridge, City of Derry and Isles of Scilly were the best airports for on-time departures. No flights from any of those four airports took off with delays longer than 15 minutes during December.

The study also showed which airports had the largest number of delays over three hours long in December - the point at which flights are potentially eligible for flight delay compensation according to EU rules.

Glasgow came out worst (1.33 per cent) and London Gatwick was second with 1.32 per cent of flights delayed over three hours.

Gatwick also won the 'wooden spoon' award for longest delay: 25 hours and nine minutes on a British Airways flight to Larnaca, Cyprus.

London Heathrow was third with 198 delays (1.02 per cent). 

Flight delay legal expert Kevin Clarke said: 'Christmas delays of three hours or more are particularly stressful because they often mean that passengers are missing out on precious time with their loved ones.

'Many of the passengers involved in the study don't realise that they could be entitled to compensation for delays.

'We sometimes hear that airlines have told them that they are not owed any money, despite having their festive plans disrupted or even ruined.

'But as we find time and time again passengers are not excluded from compensation just because airlines tell them that they are.'
