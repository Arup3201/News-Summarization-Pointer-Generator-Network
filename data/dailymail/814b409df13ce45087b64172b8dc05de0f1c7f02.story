A judge has again decided to give no jail time to a Texas teenager who was responsible for a drunk driving crash that killed four people.

Ethan Couch was given 10 years' probation for the wreck last year that also severely injured two people. But he was back in court Wednesday after prosecutors requested jail time on charges related to the two people who were injured.

Judge Jean Boyd issued the original sentence and made Wednesday's ruling.

The original sentence stirred fierce debate, as a defense expert said Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility. The expert termed the condition 'affluenza.'

Prosecutors made one last ditch effort to put the 16-year-old behind bars in the intoxication assault cases.

'During his recent trial, the 16-year-old admitted his guilt in four cases of intoxication manslaughter and two cases of intoxication assault,' DA Joe Shannon told Star-Telegram in December, before the latest decision.

'There has been no verdict formally entered in the two intoxication assault cases. Every case deserves a verdict. The district attorney's office is asking the court to incarcerate the teen on the two intoxication assault cases.'

The two intoxication assault cases referred to the two teenagers riding in the same car as Couch, Sergio Molina and Soliman Mohmand. Sergio can still only communicate by blinking months after the crash.

The maximum allowable sentence for the two counts was three years in a juvenile prison, but despite a guilty plea the judge still decided to issue no punishment.

Forever changed: Sergio Molina, now 16, was in a coma following the June accident but now has been transferred home as his family grapples with how to adjust to his now-permanent paralysis

The two friends were in the back of a pickup truck being driven erratically by 
Couch when he slammed into four people on the side of a road.

Those four people - a young woman whose car had broken down, a Good Samaritan trying to help, and a mother and daughter who also got out to see what they could do - were all killed.

Before: Sergio had dreams of playing professional soccer before the accident

Sergio, who is now 16, is still alive but
 has a completely different existence than he did before the accident as
 he is paralyzed, 'minimally conscious' and needs constant medical 
attention.

Speaking to CNN in December, Sergio's older brother Alex Lemus said that doctors warned them of getting their hopes too high.

'That's all we can hope for, is how he is now for the rest of his life,' Lemus said.

He attended Couch's 2013 trial in place of his brother, who can barely move without assistance.

When
 the judge handed down a sentence of 10 years' probation and no jail 
time for the crash, Lemus said that he had trouble processing his anger.

He said he was 'disappointed, so outrageously angry that I couldn't say anything.'

His
 mother, Maria Lemus, still breaks down in tears when thinking about all
 of Sergio's dreams that seem so far out of reach in light of the 
accident.

'He was the best son, he was the kind of boy who had a lot of dreams,' Lemus said.  

'He was his first dream was to be a soccer player. He was sweet.'

Sergio's
 family estimates that they have accrued more than $1million in medical 
bills since the crash, and they are now suing Couch's family 
and his father's business - the car that the boys were in was owned by 
his company - for up to $20million.

'That kid killed four people 
and crippled my little brother and doesn't even have to serve one year? 
If he were poor like us, he would've gotten 10 years, I bet,' Alex Lemus
 told The Dallas Morning News.

The
 fatal accident occurred around 11:45pm on June 15, Couch and a group 
his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford F350 pick-up and 
were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road.

As
 it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the 
owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the
 air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby
 Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact.

It
 was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - 
three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in
 their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium 
when he started the chain reaction of crashes.

Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash

The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported.

A
 psychologist called by the defense, Dr Gary Miller, blamed the teen's 
behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted 
including 'freedoms no young person should have.'

Dr
 Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt 
their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between 
behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual 
age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12.

'The
 teen never learned to say that youâ€™re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr 
Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you 
sent him money.'

His father Frederick Couch is a wealthy businessman, who
owns a metal works, Cleburne Sheet Metal, with an estimated yearly turnover of
$15 million and around 30 staff.

After a difficult divorce from Ethan's mother Tonya, he
apparently gave his son the huge single story property.

Instead of prison, Couch is set to spend time at the swanky Newport Academy male residential rehabilitation center in California with his parents footing the bill

No jail: Judge Jean Boyd is facing calls to be removed from her position after she handed out a remarkably lenient sentence of 10 years probation to Ethan Couch who killed four people while on a drunken joyride

Couch was also allegedly given his own car when he was just 13 and was driving a
powerful truck owned by his dadâ€™s company on the night of the accident.

State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense.

She
 told the teen that he is responsible for what happened, but she said 
she didn't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail. If he
 violates the terms of his probation, he could be sent to prison for 10 
years.

Defense attorneys 
asked that he be sent to a private rehabilitation home near Newport 
Beach, California, which costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father 
said he'd foot the bill.

Judge
 Jean Boyd, who awarded the remarkably lenient sentence to Couch in the 
controversial case, is facing continued calls to be removed from her 
position.

Although she is expected to retire next year, a petition at change.org demanding that Texas Governor Rick Perry remove her from the bench immediately has received more than 22,000 supporters.
