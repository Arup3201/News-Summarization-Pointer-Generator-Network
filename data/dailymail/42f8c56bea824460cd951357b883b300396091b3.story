Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross wrestling striker Wilfried Bony to the floor was a stonewall penalty and referee Michael Oliver should be congratulated on having the courage to give it.

Too often these days defenders get away with this sort of grappling, particularly at corners and free kicks.

He booked Shawcross as well and it’s good to see a referee acting firmly in an attempt to put a stop to this type of desperate defending.

However, Oliver suffered a momentary lapse and got it completely wrong later in the first half when he awarded a penalty for what was clearly a dive by Stoke forward Victor Moses.

Although Swansea defender Angel Rangel was running alongside Moses as he ran into the area there was little or no contact.

In cases like this it should be possible for retrospective action to be taken against Moses for blatant simulation.
