The ex-wife of the Washington D.C. sniper has revealed how she spent years living in terror after he threatened to kill her.

Ten years after John Muhammad and his accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot dead 10 people in a murderous three-week rampage, Mildred Muhammad has spoken out about her life of fear.

She revealed how he threatened to hunt her down after their 2000 divorce, snatched her three children and took them to Antigua for two years before they were finally tracked down by police.

And she has also told how, years later when their father was executed for his crimes, the children broke down in tears as he never called them to say goodbye.

Speaking with People Magazine, Mildred Muhammad recounted how her husband left to serve in the Gulf War in 1990 and returned a changed man the following year.

Her caring husband had transformed into an emotionally abusive man and began 'treating me like his enemy', she said. It sparked her to take out a restraining order against him and file for divorce.

He kidnapped their children, then six, eight and 10, in 2001 and the police located them when he tried to get food stamps - but that did not stop Mildred's fears.

'What most people don't know is that I was the person he was after,' she told People. 'Two years prior he threatened to kill me when I asked for a divorce.

'I didn't know where John was or what he 
was doing, but I looked for him on the rooftops and nearby levees. He 
told me he was going to kill me, and I knew he would.'

On October 2, 2002, the pair began their killing spree, gunning down people indiscriminately in parking lots and outside their homes in the D.C. area.

When Mildred learned of the killings, she never considered it could be her ex-husband.

'I was scared like everybody else, but my fear was more intense because I was also hiding from John,' she told the magazine. 'I always knew if he killed me, it would be a shot to the head.'

Police later told her that her ex-husband has sent his then 17-year-old sidekick, Malvo, to Mildred's home to pretend to be a salesman and shoot her dead.

The terror ended on October 24, 2002,
when police caught the pair as they slept at a Maryland rest stop in a 
car they had outfitted 
for a shooter to perch in its boot without being seen.

That day, the FBI hauled Mildred in for a meeting and revealed her ex-husband was the killer. 'My head hit the table,' she remembered. 'I was shocked.'

But when they asked if she thought he was capable of the murders, she said that he was.

Struggle: Mildred, who speaks out against domestic abuse, said she lived in fear that her ex-husband would shoot her dead after she divorced him. She said she was not surprised he was the sniper

He had once told her: 'I could take a small city and terrorize it. Everybody would think it was a group of people, and it would only be me.'

She was placed in protective custody with her children, John, Salena and Taalibah, who continued to ask about their father.

He was convicted of capital murder in Virginia in 2003 and, three years later, he was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in Maryland.

As his execution on November 10, 2009 - when he was 48 - neared, his children hoped to speak to him one last time, Mildred told People. His lawyer said he would take his cell phone with him.

'The children waited for their dad to call, but it was a call that didn't come,' she said. 'We watched the television until a man came out and said John expired. My children lost it.'

Malvo, who is now 27 and recently told 
the Today show that Muhammad sexually abused him for two years, is 
serving a life sentence in a south Virginia prison without the 
possibility of parole.

He has claimed that he was 'brainwashed' by Muhammad, whom he had met when he lived in Antigua with his mother, and lived in fear that he would disappoint him.

Police have never confirmed that Muhammad was motivated by his desire to kill her and regain custody of their three children; Malvo said Muhammad wanted to extort $10 
million from the government to set up a camp in Canada where homeless 
children would be trained as terrorists.

Mildred has written a book about domestic abuse and tours the country speaking out about her experiences - which she said are firmly in the past and no long haunt her.

'I'm so sorry that so many people were killed,' she added. 'It's not my fault. I was afraid of him like everyone else. I stopped being afraid, I guess, when they executed him on November 10, 2009.'
