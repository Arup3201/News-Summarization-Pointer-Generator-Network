Horrific: Desiree Staperfene, 17, was forced to watch her mother and boyfriend being murdered

A jilted teenager who was 'addicted to a certain kind of sadness' wreaked revenge on his former girlfriend by forcing her to watch him hack her mother and new boyfriend to death with an axe before he killed himself.

Brian Douglas White, 19, who has quotes from the crime drama all over his Facebook page started his deadly rampage at the Detroit home of his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend at 7.30am Wednesday morning.

He allegedly murdered Desiree Staperfene's mother, Angela Kim Staperfene, 46, and Desiree's new boyfriend Jacob Lee Burns, 19, before turning a gun on himself, police said.

Desiree, 17, managed to escape after a struggle with White.

She called police around 12.20pm, law enforcement officers said.

An aspiring model and a senior at Stevenson High School, Desiree was hospitalised, treated and later 
released, according to reports.

Neighbours
and classmates said the teen is a 'happy, outgoing and compassionate girl who was raised 
in a loving home'.

Meanwhile, chilling details have emerged about White.

His Facebook account, which has since been deleted, tells of his troubled mind, and a disturbing obsession with the movie American Psycho, released in 2000.

His profile is a mix of esoteric musings and quotes from the movie, including: 'Did I mention I'm utterly insane?'

The cover photo for his timeline depicted a gory scene, with blood spattered across a white mattress and a wooden nightstand.

He posted messages such as 'You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness' and said he was 'desperate to connect'.

White’s wall is peppered with American 
Psycho quotes, including: ‘I like to dissect girls. Did I mention I’m 
utterly insane?’ and ‘I hate the word “manipulation.”’

Along with the quotes, there were 
other deeply worrying signs.

He changed the image on his Timeline to a 
disturbing picture of blood spattered over a mattress and a nightstand.

His wall was filled with other cryptic updates, like ‘Withering into nothing’ on March 19, and ‘What a polite murderer’

Friends and neighbours in the quiet city are shocked over the news.

Classmate Amanda Mellville told myFOXdetroitt: 'She's (Desiree) a good friend of mine.

'When
I was watching the news, I was about to cry because I thought she was 
like in trouble. I mean, I still feel bad for her, but it's sad.'

Neighbour
Lisa Collins told The Detroit News that White has, earlier in the week,
confronted his ex-lover at school and she had rejected him.

Christian Bale starred as Patrick Bateman, a killer with no remorse

White’s Facebook account, which has since been deleted, details his troubled mind, and a disturbing obsession with the movie American Psycho.

In the movie, Christian Bale’s character Patrick Bateman describes his obsession with ‘murders and executions.’

He later kills another character in the movie, Paul Allen, by taking an axe to his face.

He calls his lawyer in the movie to say: 'I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here.'

White’s wall is peppered with American Psycho quotes, including: ‘I like to dissect girls. Did I mention I’m utterly insane?’ and ‘I hate the word “manipulation.”’

She
said: 'He was very controlling. That's why she broke it off with him. 
She got out, thank God.'

And added: 'She's a very happy, outgoing girl.'

Police sources said the bloody incident, inside a home on Sunnydale near Five Mile and Inkster Road - where the family had lived for between five to seven years - was being treated as a double murder and a suicide.

Livonia Mayor Jack Kirksey called the situation 'a great tragedy.'

She added: 'Our hearts do go out to the families of the deceased.'

He added that the investigation was 'still a work in progress'.

Family and friends left tributes, including a candle and flowers, near the home last night.

Nancy Radtke told Detroit Free Press that 46-year-old mother Angela Kim Staperfene, who was married, was a strong woman.

Ms Radtke said: 'If Angie had anything to do with it to defend herself, I’m sure she went out in a blaze of glory. She was a feisty person.

'Angie always wanted the best for her daughter, always wanted the best for her daughter.'

Livonia is a large suburb in the Detroit metro area. As of the 2010 census, it had a population just shy of 100,000.

Though it is considered an affluent area – with a median household income of $65,000 – it was hit hard by the recession.

Residents describe the neighbourhood - full of mid-century brick ranch houses - as family-oriented and safe.

The Staperfene family wishes to extend their heartfelt
thanks to the many friends, neighbors and their extended family – as well as
the Livonia community and its young people - for their prayers, sympathy,
kindness and condolences in the wake of this horrific tragedy.

Despite the unbelievable pain and loss of Desiree losing her
mother, and David Staperfene’s loss of his loving wife of 21 years, we are
grateful that Desiree was able to survive. 
It is the one shining miracle we all hold on to, in the face of this
unthinkable event.

Our sympathies also, are with the family of Jake Burns. He
was a family friend that the Staperfenes welcomed into their home, as they have
done countless times for others. David and Angela both have extended their
hospitality and hearts to so many. It is comforting to hear what an impact such
graciousness has meant for others, and we appreciate the kind favors you have
given from your own hearts at this time of need.

The family will be setting up the Angela K. Staperfene Fund
for those who wish to donate toward funeral and other expenses.

It is so deeply unfortunate that a simple breakup would
cause such everlasting pain and loss. Please know that the Staperfene family is
resilient, strong, and with courage. If anything in this world is a testament
to such a thing, it is Desiree’s survival. She is a wonderful reflection of her
mother’s strong convictions, and her father’s calm, steady guidance.

We can only hope that other young people will understand
that a breakup is not a permanent loss, but a gateway to another path. Had the
perpetrator of these killings understood that healing is a better alternative
to anger and hurt, nobody would be experiencing anything but the continuation
of their lives.

God Bless.

The Staperfene family and friends.

Ps- Desiree would like to thank the officer who first
arrived on the scene for his compassion and care.
