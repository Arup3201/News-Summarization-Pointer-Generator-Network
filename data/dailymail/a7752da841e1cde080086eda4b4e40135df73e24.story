Shocking claim: George Anthony, the father of Casey Anthony, believes his daughter or someone with her drugged his granddaughter thereby causing the youngster's death

The father of Casey Anthony believes his daughter - or someone with her - drugged his two-year-old granddaughter thereby causing the girl's death.

He made the shocking claim in front of his stunned wife during a TV interview aired yesterday.

His daughter was acquitted in July of murdering her daughter, Caylee, in a case that gripped America. The verdict caused national uproar with people venting their fury over social media as well as on radio and TV.

'I believe that Casey or someone else that she was with, possibly gave too much to Caylee, she fell asleep and didn't wake up. That's what I feel,' George Anthony said on the  'Dr. Phil' show.

Host Phil McGraw then asked him what substance he thinks could have been given to Caylee. He replied that it could have been a drug, such as the anti-anxiety medicine Xanax.

He also mentioned chloroform, but seemed to discount that possibility.

Mr Anthony then offered an explanation as to might have motivated his daughter to drug and sedate his granddaughter.

'To go out and have a good time, to be with friends, to have this life that she didn't have with Caylee,' he said.

Anthony's parents shared their opinions during the second part of an interview with McGraw that was broadcast yesterday.

The explanation from George Anthony, who also said that the pain of losing his granddaughter nearly pushed him to suicide, is similar to the view of some outside commentators on what may have happened to Caylee.

Cindy Anthony expressed shock at her husband's explanation, and said on the show that it was the first time she had 'heard that out of his mouth'

The defense lawyer in the Casey Anthony murder trial has been hired to help a U.S. businessman held over the presumed death of his travel companion. Jose Baez (right) was the lead defense lawyer for Anthony in her trial.

Mr Baez has now been hired to defend Gary Giordano in Aruba, who is suspected of killing Robyn Gardner.

Ms Gardner, 35, from Maryland, was last seen alive on August 2 - two days after she travelled to Aruba with Giordano who she apparently met on a swingers sex website.

He reported her missing and denies committing any crime, insisting the woman was swept out to sea while she was snorkelling. A body has not been found.

Giordano's Aruban lawyer Michael Lopez says his client's father Frank hired Mr Baez, who will act as a consultant.

He can service in an advisory role and provide other assistance but cannot actually argue in court on the Duth Caribbean island.

Mr Lopez said: 'If my client wants me to share all information with Baez, I will do so, even though his role will be that of a consultant.'

He added: 'If Casey is watching this someday - Yes, I think she's responsible for Caylee not being here.'

But
his wife Cindy expressed shock at her husband's explanation, and said 
on the show that it was the first time she had 'heard that out of his 
mouth'.

She believes that 
Caylee Anthony drowned, that Casey knew where her toddler was buried and
may have had help placing her body there.

Caylee Anthony was the focus of a 
wide-ranging search after her disappearance in June 2008. Casey Anthony 
told police that a fictitious babysitter had kidnapped the child.

The 
25-year-old maintained the same story to her family until the child's 
skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in December 2008 not far 
from the the home of George and Cindy Anthony.

During her trial prosecutors argued 
that Casey Anthony killed the girl by smothering her with duct tape
and later buried her to hide the body. But defense attorneys suggested 
that Caylee died from an accidental drowning in a backyard swimming 
pool.

She was acquitted in July, but convicted of four charges of lying to police.

She is currently somewhere in Florida
serving a year of probation on a separate check fraud conviction. 
Authorities are keeping her whereabouts confidential for her safety.

Despite her acquittal, Casey Anthony 
has been scorned by the public, and her parents - who at times have 
defended her - have not fared much better in popular opinion.

The couple spoke with McGraw for a lengthy, 
taped interview over a two-day period recently. A portion of the 
interview devoted to Casey Anthony's murder trial will also be shown 
later this month

Cindy Anthony said that while she believes her granddaughter drowned, she didn't believe defense attorney Jose Baez's assertion that George Anthony was there or helped cover up the death.

She, too, said she thinks Casey knew where Caylee was buried and that is what upsets her most today.

'I believe Casey knew or had knowledge of placing Caylee there,' she said. '...I'm not justifying what Casey did. But until I find out what happened to Caylee and what happened to Casey that day, I have to live with what I know.'

She also told McGraw that she prayed nightly during the past three years that if Casey was somehow responsible for Caylee's death that she'd go to jail.

She said the fact that her daughter was acquitted tells her she wasn't at fault.

'When that verdict came in and Casey was found not guilty, I got my answer,' Cindy Anthony said '...I'm not gonna be her judge and jury. God is her judge and he set her free.'

The first part of McGraw's interview with Cindy and George Anthony aired on "Dr. Phil" on Tuesday.

Anthony's parents shared their opinions during the second part of an interview with Dr Phil McGraw that aired yesterday. They spoke with McGraw for a lengthy, taped interview over a two-day period
