Parents  in Kent say their children's school has become a 'living hell' since controversial 'super head' Jane Porter (pictured) was brought in to raise standards

Parents are protesting and teachers quitting their jobs over a controversial new primary school 'super head' who once banned children from mentioning Christmas or David Beckham.

King’s Farm Primary in Gravesend, Kent is ‘in crisis’ after more than half its teaching staff resigned and parents holding signs and placards staged a protest outside the school.

It follows the appointment of headmistress Jane Porter in January as part of attempts by Kent Council to raise standards at the school.

Mrs Porter made headlines last year after she ‘banned’ all 515 at another Kent primary from mentioning Christmas before December 1 in case it distracted them from their work.

She said that children would lose their ‘golden time’ if festivities were talked about before December. She said the same would apply to mentions of Beckham.

A group of 20 parents convened outside King’s Farm last week to protest that the head had turned the school into a ‘living hell’.

They said the school was ‘in crisis’ amid a mass departure of staff and children were missing out on school trips, PE lessons, sports days and other activities.

The school has 15 teachers and 27 teaching assistants but 25 of them have announced they will not be returning after the summer holidays.

Emma Friend, 28, who has four children at the school aged three to eight, said: ‘Since Mrs Porter came in all communication has broken down.

‘Sports days and trips have been cancelled, since she took over the school has been hell. My children cannot cope with the changes.

‘The two Year 5 and 6 classes have been combined and my boy is chewing his jumper because he is worried about the instability.’

Around half of the staff at King’s Farm Primary in Gravesend, Kent are believed to be leaving over the summer

Ruth Serwotka, a National Union of Teachers representative, said the ‘exodus’ of teachers and teaching staff was an ‘incredible and catastrophic crisis’, telling the local paper: ‘It is obviously a very challenging school.

‘I have put forward a formal complaint from teachers and teaching staff to Kent County Council.

‘There are significant issues and there is a huge amount of insecurity with so many staff leaving the children have no stability.’

Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Since January it has been all change and you can see by the number of teaching staff leaving that everyone thinks the same - the teachers, the parents and the children, they all want out.’

But other parents gave a different perspective. Tony Hughes, 42, said: ‘They (protesters) are all scared of change.

‘I don’t quite know what they’re hoping for. Do they want the head out because she’s making changes? If it’s not her it will be someone else.

‘From what we’ve seen of her she’s been brilliant and helpful, and the kids love her.’

According to a 2012 Ofsted report the school is ‘satisfactory’, which means it is deemed to ‘require improvement’ under new Ofsted categories.

Ms Porter has caused controversy in the past by threatening to punish children for talking about David Beckham or Christmas, claiming pupils were getting distracted from their work

In November last year, Mrs Porter was branded a ‘Scrooge’ after banning children at nearby Whitehill Primary from mentioning Christmas before December 1.

She said at the time: ‘I’m not joking when I say this started 2,000 years ago.

‘The long and short of it is that one of the golden rules is to work hard, so if children are not working hard, talking about Christmas for instance, then they will lose their golden time.

‘That would be the case with anything not related to school; they shouldn’t be talking about David Beckham either.

‘If they are talking about something they shouldn’t be, they’re not working hard; we are a school, we’re about education, not retail.’

Mrs Porter remains in charge of Whitehill as well as King’s Farm.

A Kent County Council spokesman said: ‘Jane Porter was brought in at the request of the local authority to raise academic standards and the quality of teaching - as she had done at Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend.

‘KCC takes complaints seriously and the governing body at King’s Farm Primary School will make sure they are properly investigated and that any response is appropriate.'
