Ed Miliband’s attempts to engage with Labour’s grassroots have backfired – after they branded his policies ‘pathetic’, ‘bland’ and even ‘catastrophic’.

The comments were posted on Labour’s Your Britain website, which was set up in 2012 to gather honest views from members on what should be in the party manifesto.

But instead it has attracted a host of highly critical views about the Labour leader’s current pitch to voters.

Backfired: Scathing comments have been posted by grassroots Labourites on a website by Ed Miliband

The Oxford Labour Party branded economic plans ‘wishy-washy’ and ‘bland’, while party and policy forum member Carol Hayton attacked the party’s ‘hugely disappointing, if not catastrophic’ position on housing.

Labour in Ulverston, Cumbria, criticised the stance on welfare reform as ‘pathetic’, and Labour’s association in Sheffield Heeley labelled the party’s education plans ‘too narrow and too timid’.

The website was launched two years ago, and Mr Miliband said it would ‘give a voice to members’.

It claims to be the ‘online home of Labour ideas and policy development’ – and tells contributors: ‘By joining in you can play a part in developing our next manifesto.’

The Tories seized on the comments, saying they showed Ed Miliband was ‘just not up to it’. But a Labour spokesman branded reports of the comments ‘desperate rubbish’.

Details of the comments emerged as a former Labour advisor launched a highly critical attack on Labour’s high command over its failure to accept public spending cuts – and said time was ‘running out’ for the party to present a vision for how it would run Britain.

Patrick Diamond, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown said Labour ‘palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity’.

Writing on the Telegraph website he said: ‘Ed Miliband’s ideological instinct is to reassert the case for interventionist government.

‘His political antennae tell him this is not sustainable in an era of rising public deficits and ballooning national debt.

‘The leader knows there can be no return to post-war ‘tax and spend’ social democracy, yet he is trapped by antipathy to the New Labour project from spelling out a non-statist alternative.

‘He faces a fork in the road, but is reluctant to choose: as a consequence, Labour palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity. With nine months to go until a general election, time is running out for Her Majesty’s opposition.’

The Your Britain website collected comments from constituency Labour Party groups across the country. 

The party in Manchester Withington warned many of its members found proposals ‘simply too vague’, while the association in Tamworth, Staffordshire warned that the draft education policy agenda ‘lacks vision, strategy and coherence’.

Labour party member and policy forum member Carol Hayton attacked the party’s ‘hugely disappointing, if not catastrophic’ position on housing.

She wrote: ‘Ed Miliband acknowledged that we have a housing crisis... He said that to solve the crisis a future Labour government would ensure that by the end of the next parliament i.e by 2020 Britain would be building 200,000 homes a year. This response is totally inadequate.’

Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, said: ‘This is pretty damning stuff. First it was Labour MPs and councillors telling us that Ed Miliband is just not up to it, now Labour’s grassroots have publicly criticised Ed Miliband’s weak leadership and political gimmicks which offer no long-term solutions for hardworking families across the country.

‘The truth is, only the Conservative team can offer a long term economic plan that will secure a brighter future for British people and their families.’

A Labour spokesman said: ‘This is desperate rubbish, pumped out by a Tory Party who’ll try anything to distract from their failure.

‘This is a public website where everyone can contribute and people have done so in their thousands. Comments aren’t Labour policy.

‘While the Tories try to sell their baseless smears, the Labour Party will get on with setting out a positive vision for Labour’s future.’
