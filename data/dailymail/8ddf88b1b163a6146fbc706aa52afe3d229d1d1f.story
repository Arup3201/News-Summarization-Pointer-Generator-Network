Mickael Antoine-Curier has signed for Burton Albion despite late interest from Cagliari.

The 31-year-old was a free agent after leaving Hamilton and had been training with Burton after speaking to manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. 

Although Burton agreed terms yesterday, Cagliari made a late approach but Antoine-Curier is keen to play regularly and hopes to help Burton go up.

Antoine-Curier last played for Scottish Premier League side Hamilton 20 goals in 51 league games

Hasselbaink hopes that Antoine-Curier's signing can act as cover for the injured Jacob Blyth and told the BBC: "He is a big player like Jacob Blyth which is what we need after Jacob's injury."

Antoine-Curier started his career with Paris Saint-Germain before playing youth team football with Preston North End and Nottingham Forest.

He made his league debut with Brentford in 2003 and had short stints at Oldham, Rochdale, Sheffield Wednesday, Notts County and Grimsby Town.

The last of his eight goals in the Scottish Premier League this season came on New Year's Day in Hamilton's 5-0 victory over Motherwell.
