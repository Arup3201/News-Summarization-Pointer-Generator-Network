Fancy a swim in a pool that has waves nine-stories high and currents four times faster than an Olympic swimmer?

That’s what awaits you if you stumble into the state-of-the-art wave pool named FloWave at the University of Edinburgh.

Of course it’s actually designed for engineers to test new technologies for wave turbines, rather than giving confident swimmers a run for their money.

A new world-class large scale testing facility (shown) which simulates waves and currents for marine energy devices was officially opened at the University of Edinburgh's Kings Buildings recently, called the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility

Complex waves, fast currents and large water spikes marked the launch of the world-class testing facility for marine energy devices.

The heart of FloWave is a 100-foot (30 metres) circular concrete basin containing the 82-foot (25 metres) diameter wave and current tank.

The 16-foot (five metres) deep tank contains 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of fresh water and is ringed by 168 absorbing wave makers.

Additionally, 28 submerged flow-drive units can simultaneously and independently drive current across the tank in any relative direction, with maximum current velocities of 5.2 feet (1.6 metres) per second.

A rising tank floor and overhead crane enable quick and easy installation of individual devices, or arrays of wave or tidal current generators.

The pool is 82 feet (25 metres) across and 6.6 feet (two metres) deep.

It recreates waves and currents from coastlines around the UK, Europe and beyond.

Its full name is the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility and it can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet (28 metres) high with currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of water.

The facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full-scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters.

It can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects.

By testing devices at scale in a tank, researchers can achieve milestones in days or weeks compared with months or years in open water.

This accelerated development could bring clean energy products to market more quickly and cost-effectively, at lower risk.

The pool can simulate scale version equivalents of waves up to 92 feet (28 metres) high and currents of up to 14 knots using 2.4 million litres (530,000 gallons) of water in an 82-foot (25 metres) diameter circular pool. Here a crowd watches as the pool generates waves during a demonstration

The pool can be used to generate fast currents and high waves. Its currents can go as fast as an Olympic swimmer while its waves can reach up to nine stories high. This allows underwater wind turbines and other technologies to be tested more easily than they can be tested at sea

The £9.5 million ($16.3 million) FloWave facility was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the University of Edinburgh.

‘We are delighted to mark the official launch of this pioneering facility, which will speed the development of devices to harness wave and current power, and further enhance the University’s position as a centre of excellence in marine energy research,’ said Professor Sir Timothy O’ Shea, Principal of the University of Edinburgh.

Professor Philip Nelson, Chief Executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, added: ‘EPSRC’s investment in the FloWave facility will help keep the UK at the forefront of marine energy technology research and development.

‘Research here can accelerate the deployment of these technologies which, in turn, will help us meet our low-carbon targets, create jobs and boost growth.’

The facility is designed for researchers and industrial partners to develop and refine full-scale devices such as wave and tidal energy converters. It can also be used to test floating offshore wind platforms and vessels to install and maintain offshore projects

One of the technologies that has been tested so far is AlbaTERN's model WaveNet device, which according to the Scottish company is 'a radical new array-based wave energy convertor that captures energy from ocean waves and converts it into sustainable low-carbon electricity'

New 'pool' at the University of Edinburgh is being used to test technologies

@highlight

Called FloWave in can be used to generate fast currents and high waves

@highlight

Currents are faster than an Olympic swimmer with waves up to nine stories

@highlight

This allows underwater wind turbines and other tech to be tested

@highlight

The testing process is much quicker than doing the same thing at sea
