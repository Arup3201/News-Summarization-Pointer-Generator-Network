The man who became an internet sensation after he badly missed a $1million halfcourt shot has revealed he came up short because his strength is gone due to a rare disorder that caused five of his organs to fail.

Scott Park took, and missed, the halfcourt shot on Friday during halftime of the ACC Tournament semifinal between Notre Dame and Duke.

A Vine capturing his failed attempt quickly began spreading on the internet.

It has been viewed more than 7.6 million times, although there is no way to know how many mean comments have been made.

His attempt fell badly short of the mark and a Vine capturing the moment began spreading on the web

Park, 56, knew the ball wasn't going in when he shot it because serious medical problems have sapped his strength, but he still wanted to give it a try, according to the Sporting News. 

Those who laughed shouldn't  feel too badly, though. The Navy environmental engineer doesn't have a problem with all the attention the shot has gotten.

He said: 'I'm happy to be alive. I'm happy to even have a chance to shoot for a million dollars. 

'I had no illusions that ball was going in.'

In 2007, Park had open heart surgery and was forced to go back to the hospital two days later because something was wrong. 

Doctors couldn't figure out why, but Park's kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder and pancreas were shutting down. 

Things got so bad that one of Park's doctors began preparing his wife Ellen for his death. 

Park's wife Ellen was at the game. He has a blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome

Patients with CAPS like Park have a 48 per cent mortality rate, primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest

After a last-ditch effort, all of Park's organs, except his kidney, began to respond and he was eventually diagnosed with a blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).

The rare disorder has only been diagnosed about 400 times.

The syndrome is 'a rapidly progressive life-threatening disease that causes multiple organ thromboses and dysfunction in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies', according to the Journal of Intensive Care Medicine. 

Patients with CAPS have a 48 per cent mortality rate, primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest. 

Park had two years of dialysis but was able to get a kidney transplant from someone who goes to his church.

He survived becoming the first person in the world with CAPS to have successful transplant surgery of any kind. 

The medical miracle, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia, now must take 39 pills each day and get an injection of an experimental drug once every two weeks, but he's healthy. 

All of that explains why the joke really wasn't on Park at all.

He said: 'The Lord has blessed me probably as much or more than a lot of people. 

'I feel that every day. 

'God has been a power in my life, and he keeps giving me miracles every day.'
