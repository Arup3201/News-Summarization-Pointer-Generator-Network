It was a proud moment for Patricia Petersen as she paraded in a blue bikini, thongs and zinc cream to greet voters during pre-polling in Queensland on Australia Day.

The Independent candidate for Ipswich, west of Brisbane, says she wanted to 'get into the spirit of things' and not be 'boring' on the national holiday.

While this may have been an unlikely choice of attire for fellow candidates, for Dr Petersen and some voters alike, it conveyed what it means to be a 'true blue Australian'.

Dr Petersen, the leader and founder of the Australian Independents party, told Daily Mail Australia she took voters and politicians by surprise when she showed up in her swimwear.

'It's the first time in Queensland history that people were asked to vote on Australia Day,' she said. 

'But I still wanted to get into the spirit of things and show how proud I was to be Australian.

'Voters were delighted that I went to the trouble of looking Australian. They were impressed that I bothered to dress up for them ... while other candidates showed up in their usual political paraphernalia.'

The 51-year-old was decked out in everything Australian head to toe - from a blue cap with the Australian flag to board shorts, stickers and temporary tattoos

Dr Petersen did admit that her blue bikini wasn't her preferred choice of swimwear, saying she had been searching for a 'modest one piece' but couldn't find one that had the Australian flag on it

The 51-year-old was decked out in everything Australian head to toe - from a blue cap with the national flag to board shorts, stickers and temporary tattoos.

As Dr Petersen uploaded the photo of herself in the blue bikini on Australia Day, she was flooded by compliments by voters.

'True blue Australian,' one man said.

'A true Aussie babe with intellect, beauty & a heart!' another voter wrote.

However Dr Petersen did admit that her bikini wasn't her preferred choice of swimwear.

'I would normally gravitate to a modest one piece, especially at my age, but I couldn't find anything that had the Australian flag on it,' she said. 

'But I was really delighted that I really embraced the day and equally delighted that people appreciated it.'

Pre-polling in Queensland opened over the public holiday weekend for the upcoming state election on Saturday.
