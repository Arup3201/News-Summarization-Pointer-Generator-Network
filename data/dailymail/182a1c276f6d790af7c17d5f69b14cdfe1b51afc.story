A besotted victim who tracked his phone thief using an app has forgiven her - because she is incredibly good looking.

Matsumoto Hiroki lost his iPhone on holiday in Bangkok.

Forced to return to Japan, he invested in a new 5C, and took to iCloud to trace his account.

Too cute to report? Matsumoto Hiroki texted the new owner of his phone, who accidentally posted a barrage of selfies to his iCloud, saying he would not alert authorities - before asking her out on a date

But what Mr Hiroki found was far from what he expected.

His photostream is now cluttered with selfies of a young, cute Thai girl dating back to December 29, when the phone went missing.

Single Mr Hiroki, sharing the development on Twitter on January 10, wrote: 'Her pictures are really cute, so Iâ€™m not sure how to handle this.'

He added: 'Sheâ€™s so cute, I want to tell her "You can keep the iPhone as long as we can be friends!"'

Followers replied encouraging him to send her a message.

But his suggestion, translated into Thai and sent to her lock screen, was met with a bombardment of photos of another young man.

Praised: The iCloud, here being launched by late Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2011, has been hailed by police

However, yesterday, after Mr Hiroki finally closed his iPhone account, he tweeted a screenshot of a text from the new owner: 'Nice to meet you!'

The incident is the latest in an increasing number of cases where victims have tracked their muggers using apps.

Find My iPhone and MobileMe, both developed by Apple, have been praised by police officials across the world for solving low-level muggings that consume their time.

In 2011, Liam Aspin, then 31, was electronically tagged after snatching 20-year-old Rio Bridge's phone - only to be traced 45 minutes later.

In 2012, Katy McCaffrey was shocked to find a collection of exotic holiday photos popping up on her laptop taken on her phone which was stolen during a Disney cruise.
