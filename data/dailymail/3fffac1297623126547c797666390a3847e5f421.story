Clouds of smoke belch from forests of chimneys, while armies of spidery figures scuttle to and fro between narrow terrace houses and imposing factory gates.

Crowds of fans shiver on the edge of a football field, a fist-fight breaks out, and barefoot children tease a stray cat on the street corner.

These are the scenes depicted in the haunting paintings of L.S. Lowry who, more than any other artist, managed to capture the strange, bleak beauty of daily life in northern industrial towns.

Recognition: L.S. Lowry, (pictured in 1957), the artist from Manchester, is the subject of a major new show at the Tate Britain gallery - the first such exhibition in a public institution in London since his death in 1976

His dream-like images captured the popular imagination, adorning chocolate boxes and biscuit tins, tea towels and jigsaws.

Yet they are scarcely to be found on the walls of our major national galleries. The Tate owns 23 of his works, but has only ever exhibited one on its walls in the past 20 years — and then only briefly.

‘It is a shame, verging on the iniquitous, that foreign visitors to London shouldn’t have access to the painter English people like more than most others,’ thundered the actor Sir Ian McKellen in a television documentary last year, suggesting an anti-northern, anti-working-class conspiracy against the flat-capped Lancastrian.

But Lowry’s exile is coming to an end. Earlier this week, the Tate Britain announced that it will stage a vast Lowry retrospective next year.

It will be the first such exhibition in a public institution in London since the artist’s death in 1976. Why has it taken so long?

‘He’s a victim of his own fan base,’ said Chris Stephens, Tate Britain’s Head of Displays. ‘What makes Lowry so popular is the same thing which stops him being the subject of serious critical attention. What attracts so many is a sort of sentimentality about him.’

This is a strangely inverted piece of art world logic, where the popularity of an artist is seen as an obstacle to showing their work.

What has the Tate been afraid of for all these years? Did they fear that the walls of its gallery would be breached by a violent stampede of clog-wearing northerners?

The art establishment has long had a patrician aversion to proletarian schmaltz — a prejudice that Lowry is not a 'proper' artist, but someone to be confined to the gift shop.

It is a stigma he battled his whole career. He was deeply ashamed of having to make a living by working as a rent-collector, seen by his contemporaries not as an artist but as 'a man who paints'. 

By day, he tramped the streets of Salford, from where he got so much of his inspiration. He observed children playing in the road, workers filing in and out of the factory, mothers gossiping, teenagers fighting, market traders selling their wares, and the prosaic daily grind of having to pay the rent.

Later, his observations would take a darker turn, including the Blitz and subsequent rebuilding, slum clearances and new housing.

The cloud of melancholy that hangs over all of Lowry’s work has a deep-rooted history in his unhappy childhood. He was born in 1887 in Stretford, between Manchester and Salford, to parents underwhelmed by his arrival. At first, his mother had difficulty even looking at him, and later expressed envy of her sister having ‘three splendid daughters’ instead of ‘one clumsy boy’.

His father, who worked as a clerk for a property company, was an introverted man whom Lowry described as a ‘cold fish’, happy to fade into the background like one of his own anonymous stickmen. It was a repressive family atmosphere, and painting presented a natural escape.

Or, as Lowry himself put it: 'Aunt said I was no good for anything else, so they might as well send me to art school.’

His naive, almost cartoonish style always led many to assume he was self-taught, but he attended art college in Manchester and Salford, studying under the French impressionist Pierre Adolphe Valette.

He only ever used five colours — ivory, black, vermilion, Prussian blue and yellow ochre — and worked the paint with sticks and fingers, stabbing at the canvas with both ends of the brush.

The surfaces of his paintings are scratched and scruffy — a total rejection of the formality of high 'academic' style.

As a result, he was often dismissed as an amateur, a ‘Sunday painter’ — to which he once retorted: 'If so, I’m a Sunday painter who paints every day of the week!'

A review of one of his earliest exhibitions in 1921 described his style as ‘authentically primitive’, as if this simple creature had been discovered daubing the walls of his cave.

It is a stylistic — and class-based — prejudice that has remained to this day. His paintings represent a world many have forgotten: the drudgery of pre and post-war Britain when life was rendered in shades of grey.

He painted the city as it was: drenched in a grimy industrial haze.  Before the dark satanic mills were rebranded as bohemian 'loft apartments' filled with boutique galleries and organic coffee shops, they were dirty, chugging, noxious things.

They were even a shock to the young Laurence Lowry, coming from the leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park.

A lack of money forced his family move to the industrial town of Pendlebury when he was 22, replacing a familiar landscape of trees with one choked by chimneys.

'At first I detested it,' he recalled. 'And then, after years, I got pretty interested in it, then obsessed by it.'

Interest: L.S. Lowry was born in Stretford, Lancashire and many of his drawings and paintings depict scenes of life in the industrial districts of Northern England

One day he missed a train and happened upon the Acme Spinning Company’s mill, ‘a huge black framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky’.

The mill was turning out at the end of the day, hundreds of bodies flooding out of the gates, a swarm of ants moving as one tidal mass. ‘I watched this scene — which I’d looked at many times without seeing — with rapture.’

Lowry’s was always a particular kind of observation, conducted at a remove from the people in his gaze. It is telling that his scenes are always painted from a raised, bird’s eye viewpoint, looking down on the life played out below as if a children’s game.

H  is people are pliable, doll-like figures, observed from a safe distance, without ever getting too involved. Faces are fleshy smears, features hidden behind turned-up collars and deep-brimmed hats.

His figures are hunched, burdened things, weighed down by cumbersome clogs and bulky overcoats. Or else they are stick-thin spindles, insignificant human flotsam ready to be blown away on the next gust.

For a painter who now enjoys such popularity, Lowry was singularly antisocial, a withdrawn outsider.

He lived alone, never married, and at the age of 88 he claimed he had 'never had a woman', poignantly adding: 'Had I not been lonely none of my works would have happened.'

Although he was not short of money in his later years, he did not earn the fortunes that his works now command. His Football Match (1949) sold at Christie’s for £5.6 million in May last year and the same astronomical price was reached by his Piccadilly Circus (1960) in November.

He died just months before a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy that broke all attendance records for a 20th-century artist. And it is this common popularity that makes Lowry so divisive.

His vision of northern, working-class towns is one that has always garnered loyal popular affection, but it is this same laconic portrayal of the day-to-day public rituals of urban life, executed in a distinctly childlike manner, that has been anathema to the rarefied world of the art establishment.

And the condescension only increased as the artist’s influence spread beyond the gallery. Two years after his death, his work was the inspiration for a sing-along pop song, Matchstalk Men And Matchstalk Cats And Dogs, which spent three weeks at the top of the charts.

'He painted Salford’s smokey tops / On cardboard boxes from the shops,' sang one-hit wonders Brian And Michael on Top Of The Pops, dressed in breeches and flat caps, gently strumming their guitars, as girls from St Winifred’s School choir swayed in the background.

‘They said he just paints cats and dogs / And matchstalk men in boots and clogs / And Lowry said that’s just the way they’ll stay.’

It may not be quite what the Tate has in mind, but it provided a fitting tribute to this astute recorder of everyday modern urban life.

Next year, 80 of his works will be shown together on the walls of the illustrious institution for the first time, finally installing this wild outsider in his rightful place — in the famous gallery appropriately founded by a fellow Lancastrian, sugar magnate Henry Tate.
