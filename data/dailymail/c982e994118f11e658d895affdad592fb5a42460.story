Clay Pell is entering the race for Rhode Island governor — and bringing along his family legacy and the star power of his wife, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan.

The grandson of late U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell will formally announce his candidacy on Tuesday. He made his intentions clear Monday with an invitation to the event bearing the logo 'Clay Pell for Governor.'

The 32-year-old Democrat served in the U.S. Coast Guard and worked on the White House National Security staff and at the U.S. Education Department.

Pell says he's prepared for the job and would bring the state together to address its economic challenges.

Clay has said in a recent interview with NBC 10 that even though he hasn't run for office before that he has the background needed to take over the position.

'There are other people with no title and a lot of power and you have to know how to maneuver through all the different pieces of government, and that was exactly my job as director for strategic planning. To take an agenda and work across departments and agencies to bringbudget together with policy...That really is the challenge for the governor here,' he said.

He believes that Rhode Island's greatest issue is that of unemployment.

He believes that making an impact on education will people get better jobs and he wants to make government programs more accessible and 'transparent.'

He faces Providence Mayor Angel Taveras and Treasurer Gina Raimondo in the Democratic primary.

Cranston Mayor Allan Fung and businessman Ken Block are running as Republicans.
