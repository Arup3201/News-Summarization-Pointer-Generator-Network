With a question mark hanging over Steven Gerrard's future beyond this season, West Ham has stepped up as a willing - if unlikely - suitor. 

The London club's vice-chairman Karren Brady believes there's plenty of game time left in the 34-year-old and that it is his critics, not the Liverpool legend himself, who should be put out to pasture. 

'It is Gerrard’s critics who should be written off,' says the hammers vice-chairman in her column for The Sun.

A number of pundits and fans believe Gerrard's role needs to change within the Liverpool formation and that the former England captain needs more chances to rest in order to prolong his career. 

The Reds lifer, so far, is off contract in the summer but yet to agree to a deal despite an offer being confirmed by manager Brendan Rodgers.

Rodgers rested Gerrard last week, with the veteran coming off the bench against Stoke, but returned to the starting line-up with a goal in Liverpool's 3-1 win over Leicester. 

'He has several good years in him yet, as several Liverpool players reminded us,' Brady writes.

'Gerrard is capable of playing in all manner of roles, he’s a terrific example to his team-mates and clearly a sound adviser of the manager’s.

'Steven, if you want a new home, West Ham could be the very place!' 

Further speculation has Gerrard potentially picking up a final big pay cheque abroad in either Asia or in the footsteps of Frank Lampard, to the MLS - although the former Chelsea ace, two years Gerrard's senior, has excelled on loan at Manchester City with his future too under debate.
