A husband who strangled his wife and stuffed her body in a 55-gallon drum has been sentenced to 22 years in prison.

Steven Acuna, 40, killed his 32-year-old wife, Randy 'Amanda' Lehrer, after a fight at their Jersey City Heights home in August 2011, according to Hudson County prosecutors.

Authorities have said Acuna filled the 55-gallon drum with cement after he put Lehrer's body inside.

Randy 'Amanda' Lehrer, 32, disappeared in August 2011 after a fight with her husband at their home. Her body was found in a drum in the basement a month later

The following month, investigators found the drum in the basement of the building where the couple lived.

Miss Lehrer’s mother, Rose Moncarz, said police identified her daughter’s body by her tattoos.

Acuna pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in October.

Acuna, 40, will spend the next two decades in jail

The couple had a daughter who is now three years old and is in the care of Lehrer's parents.

Miss
 Lehrer was last seen arguing with her husband on the day she 
disappeared.

She was reported missing five days later on August 17 by Mr
 Acuna.

Miss Lehrer's 
boss, Andreas Diakos, said Acuna called the restaurant where his wife worked 
three days after the argument.

He told her employer that Miss Lehrer went to visit her sick mother 
in Canada, and would not be coming to work.

Hudson County Prosecutor Edward DeFazio said Acuna moved to Toms River after Lehrer vanished.

Before his arrest, police said Mr Acuna was uncooperative with investigators, and refused to be interviewed without a lawyer present.

Judge Paul DePascale ordered no early release for Acuna when he was sentenced on Friday, according to nj.com. Acuna spoke briefly to apologize to Lehrer's family at his sentencing.
