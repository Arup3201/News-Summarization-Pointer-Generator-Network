Middleweight stars Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr will clash in one of the biggest all-British showdowns in recent years promoter Frank Warren confirmed.

The undefeated rivals have traded insults for the last few years and will now finally get to settle their differences in the ring when they face each other in November.

Plenty of pride and bragging rights will be on the line when they meet, bringing back memories of the Nigel Benn v Chris Eubank encounter in 1990.

Billy Joe Saunders has claimed the British, Commonwealth and European titles in his 20 fights

Hatfield ace Saunders will defend his European title against Eubank Jnr for the first time after claiming the belt with a stunning eighth round KO win over Italian Emanuele Blandamura in July.

The 2008 Olympian hasn’t put a foot wrong in 20 fights, claiming the British, Commonwealth and European titles, and Eubank Jnr. will be the fourth undefeated fighter that Saunders has faced in a row, after inflicting first losses to Gary O’Sullivan, John Ryder and Blandamura.

Brighton hotshot Eubank Jnr has blitzed his way through the middleweight division, knocking 12 out of 17 early with his lightning fast, dynamite fists, and is currently on a nine-fight KO run.

The son of the British great has been in Las Vegas training alongside Floyd Mayweather Jnr as he prepares for the biggest test of his career against Saunders.

Warren said: 'This is a fabulous fight between two undefeated British fighters and it has all the ingredients to be a thriller. 

'Saunders has done everything asked of him so far winning British, Commonwealth, WBO Intercontinental, and European titles and as he’s shown, the better the opponent the better he performs. 

'Their rivalry has been building up over the last few years and now it’s time for them to lay it all on the line and prove who is the best.'
