Health researchers tracking the size of American waistlines found that over a little more than a decade, Americans have added an inch of girth.

The Centers for Disease Control published the results of a study Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association that suggested obesity is on the rise across the United States. 

Researchers suspect that sleep deprivation and overmedication are to blame.

Expanding: Based on waistline measurements, American obesity is still on the rise, with belt sizes increasing by an average of 3% 

The researchers used waistline measurements of adults over 20 collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012 to examine trends among the US population.

What they found is that Americans could stand to lose a few.

In the period of 1999 to 2000, the average adult had a waistline of 37.6inches. By 2011-2012, the measurement was up 3% to 38.8inches.

The study disputes some earlier findings that Americans had finally managed to stop obesity rates from increasing, as Bloomberg reported last year. 

The studies that finding was based on used body mass index instead of waist measurement. 

The Los Angeles Times writes that researchers pointed out five demographics among the 32,800 people in the study saw 'particularly large increases.'

The average African-American woman in her 30s had a waistline increase of about 4.6inches, while white women in their 40s saw waists increase by 2.6inches.

African-American men in their 30s saw an increase of 3.2inches.

Mexican-American men in their 20s increased 3.4inches while Mexican-American women in their 70s added 4.4inches.

A person is considered abdominally obese with waistline measurements of 40inches for men and 35inches for women.

A variety of factors, including sleep deprivation, were cited for the increase.

The New York Times reports that sleep deprivation may change brain patterns that prevent a person from feeling full after eating.

The authors also cited overmedication as well as endocrine disruptors, which are chemicals found in consumer goods like plastic bottles and in environmental pollutants like pesticides.
