A California mother is mourning the loss of her son for a second time after thieves stole the baby boy's ashes from her home.

Raynesha Williams said burglars broke into her home near West and Hammer Lanes, Stockton, on Wednesday, and took Zachary Toliver's urn.

'It was like losing a child all over again,' Williams said.

Devastated: Raynesha Williams is mourning the loss of her stillborn son for the second time after burglars stole the baby's urn from her Stockton, California home on Wednesday

Invasion: Williams said the burglars cleaned out her California home, only leaving behind this pile of clothes

Investigating: During a TV broadcast, Stockton Police Officer Joseph Silva asked the burglars to return the precious urn

The devastated mom said she noticed the doors and windows were wide open when she got home and the urn, in a blue velvet box with the boy's initials on it, was missing.

She said the robbers 'took everything they wanted, and then some', only leaving behind a small pile of clothes.

'I was walking around to see exactly what was missing. How they 
got in, how they got out, and realized that his urn was missing,' she 
told Fox40.

Williams said Zachary was stillborn. She said she has had five miscarriages in the last five years, including one on Monday.

'It’s been a hard couple of years,' Williams said.

She suggested the burglars drop the urn off at her doorstep.

'It’s not of any value or anything. It's metal. You can't get anything for it. It's only sentimental value to me,' she said.

Stockton Police Officer Joseph Silva has called on the public to help to find the urn.

'If you get burglarized, that’s obviously traumatic, but if you have 
something stolen that means something to you, like an urn with your 
child’s ashes, that’s very sentimental,' he said.

'We’re encouraging the burglars to drop the urn with the ashes off somewhere.'
