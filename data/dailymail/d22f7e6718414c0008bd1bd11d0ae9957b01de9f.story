The average female porn star is a brunette from California with a size 34B chest, a new series of detailed infographics has revealed.

Analysis into 10,000 profiles on the Internet Adult Film Database, by writer Jon Millward, took into account each woman's height, weight, bra size, name, race and birthplace.

Defying the stereotype of the buxom blonde, he found that the average bra size is a relatively modest 34B and that most female performers are brunettes, rather than blondes or redheads.

In fact, Mr Millward reveals, most people believe that the average porn star is a DD. This bra cup size actually ranks fourth, after B, C and D.

She will typically weigh 117lbs, 48lbs less than the national average, and be 5ft 5in tall.

He also found that 42per cent of women in the industry have a tattoo, and 40per cent have a piercing somewhere other than their ears.

The raciest race? An overwhelming majority - 70per cent of porn performers - are white, the study revealed, with just 14per cent of them black, 9.3per cent Latina and  5.2per cent Asian

It seems the typical female performer is also most likely to use the name Nikki Lee, given that Nikki and Lee are the most common first and last names respectively. Jessica, Lisa, Kelly and Angel are also popular first name choices for women, while David is the most common for men.

Typically, a woman in the industry starts her career at the age of 22 - a figure that has not changed over the past 40 years, he found, though the average starting age for their male counterparts has been getting progressively younger (from 29 to the current age 24).

The figures: The average female porn star weighs 48lbs less than the average woman. She is 5ft 4in tall and wears a 32B size bra

She will stay in the business for just three years and do 19 films in that time - this figure has fallen since the Seventies when women worked in porn for an average of nine years.

The ten most prolific female performers, have an average career length of 17.7 years, and have slept with an average of 148 men in that time. The ten most prolific male porn stars, in comparison, have slept with an average of 1,013 women in a 22.4-year career.

Four times as many female porn stars hail from California than anywhere else, Mr Millward reveals, with 939 of the porn stars profiled citing the West Coast state as their place of birth.

The second most common birthplace was Florida, with 216 hailing from the Sunshine State.

What's in a name? The most popular moniker for women in porn is Nikki, while David is the favorite for men. Lee is the most common last name, even though it is only the 24th most popular in the U.S. overall

Mr Millward also charted the type of roles each woman is typically cast in, the movie titles, and the sex acts they are prepared to perform on camera.

The most common female porn role, for instance, was 'teen', which appeared in 1,966 titles.

'MILF' (acronym for Mother I'd Like to F***) was in 954 film titles, while 'wife', 'cheerleader' and 'nurse' also ranked highly.

Role play: The average age for a MILF is younger than one might imagine. At just 33, the women playing these roles are certainly younger than 'Stifler's Mom' in the American Pie series

The
 average age for a MILF is younger than one might imagine, though. At 
just 33, the women playing these roles are certainly younger than 
'Stifler's Mom' in the American Pie series, in which the acronym was 
coined. Indeed, just seven per cent are over 40.

Writing about the reasons he decided to undertake the extensive research project, Mr Millward says he had long wanted to 'plunder [the Internet Adult Film Database's] treasure trove of juicy information.'

He explains that the study enabled him to 'find out
 once and for all which stereotypes about porn stars are true, which are
 bogus, and what these men and women have been doing for the last forty 
years.'
