Many pregnant women do like to keep up with a gentle exercise routine while expecting, but it's doubtful that many would fancy doing an 800m running race.

However, a five-time U.S. national champion did just that and ran it in just over two minutes - all while she was 34-weeks pregnant.

Olympian Alysia Montano may have finished last in the race yesterday at the Hornet Stadium in Sacramento, California, but she said she enjoyed it and felt 'really good'.

Look at her go! Alysia Montano, left, who is 34 weeks pregnant, competes in an 800m race in Sacramento, California

The 28-year-old runner, who received a 
standing ovation after completing the race in 2 minutes, 32.13 seconds, 
said: 'I've been running throughout my pregnancy and I felt really, 
really good during the whole process.'

Her finishing time was 35 seconds slower than her personal best of 1:57.34, which she smashed back in 2010 in a race in Monaco, but is still a time many recreational runners wouldn't be able to achieve.

Nicknamed the 'flying flower' thanks to always racing with one in her hair, she joked her biggest fear was being lapped in USATF Outdoor Championships race.

'I just didn't want to get lapped and be the first person to get lapped in the 800,' said Montano.

Feeling fine: Olympian Alysia Montano finished last in the race but still ran at a pace many would struggle to achieve

She has grown up training and competing so didn't want to stop while pregnant- and her doctors said there was no reason why she couldn't carry on

The 28-year-old is expecting her first baby with her husband Louis, who she married in 2011.

Doctors gave Montano the OK to take part in the race and she hopes it dispels misconceptions over exercise and pregnancy.

'That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,' Montano said of getting her doctor's approval.

Montano has been training and competing since she was a child and was glad to find there was no reason why she shouldn't continue while expecting.

'What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby...I did all the things I normally do...I just happened to be pregnant. This is my normal this year,' she said.

She knew she had no chance of winning or running at her best during the race but emphasises that wasn't the point. She wanted to take part for the joy of racing.

She writes on her blog that she thinks it's important that people - whatever their ability - remember that it's the taking part in sport that counts.

'Racing is still very enjoyable for me because I've been able to think of it like a kid does. They're so innocent - they're wanting to win but they're having fun, too,' she writes.

'As you get older, it's easy to put importance on things that really don't matter and then succumb to that pressure; so I don't like to get myself wrapped up by talking about competitive goals too much.'

Good effort: Montano, a four-time national 
champion in the 800, came in last in her heat with a time a 2 minutes, 
32.3 seconds and received a standing ovation

Doctor's orders: Her doctors encouraged her to participate, which, she says, took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy

Seasoned athlete: Montano competing before her pregnancy. She was 5th in the London 2012 Olympics, right

Flying flower: Her pace in the race while pregnant was a lot slower than she usually goes around the track when racing

Experts 
say it's safe for women who are used to keeping fit like Montano to 
carry on exercising while pregnant - albeit at a lower intensity than 
before.

The
 pace Montano ran at in the race while pregnant would certainly be a 
more leisurely one for her than usual - in the 2012 Olympic Games in 
London, she came 5th with a time under two minutes.

It seems likely she will get back into training when it's safe to do so after having her baby and she has admitted one of her dreams is to one day open a personal fitness studio for working parents - where they can bring their children along to keep fit too.

Run for fun: She's used to winning races but said it's the taking part that counts

Fitness advocate: Montano would one day like to open a fitness centre for families

She said: 'I want to teach people about exercise and fitness and how it can be really fun, and I want to help parents educate their children about it, because that's where everything starts.'

She's certainly not the first to pull on her jogging shoes while pregnant and she won't be the last.

Nell McAndrew famously came under fire when she
revealed in 2012 that at 20 weeks pregnant with her second child, she was still running
six miles a day.

Like Olympic athletes including Paula Radcliffe and Jo Pavey,
who ran moderately throughout their
pregnancies and went on to have healthy babies, Nell decreased the
intensity as well as length of her runs to alleviate any risk to herself and her unborn child. Before she conceived, she had been running 90 miles a week while training for the London Marathon so six miles a day was a significant reduction in mileage.

Yet despite Nell taking all the precautions recommended by medical professionals,
she has still faced outrage from people who have accused her of putting her baby at risk through exercise.

Keeping fit: Nell McAndrew was still running six 
miles a day while pregnant with her second child, but this is a big step
 down from the mileage she did when training to run sub three hours at 
the London Marathon in 2012, right

She
 told the MailOnline at the time: 'When I tell people I'm still exercising, they 
react as if I've told them I've been smoking or drinking alcohol while 
pregnant. But what I'm doing is actually good for me and my baby.'

Nell said she felt good being active and that by being fit, she felt better prepared for child birth.

'I feel like keeping fit is preparing me for the labour - which will be harder than running a marathon!' she said.

Nell's belief that fitness aids labour is is
backed up by studies that have found that babies
of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because
'fetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers,' according to The Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).

Famous example: Paula Radcliffe reduced her 
training but carried on running when she was pregnant, as pictured here 
when taking part in a fun run with her daughter Isla while carrying her 
son

Along with official NHS guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate
exercise a day for expectant mothers, the RCOG also advocate exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy and
precautions are taken such as not exercising at a high intensity to raise the heart rate to its maximum and not running
while it's too hot due to a risk of overheating.

They state: 'In most cases, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during
pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue
exercise to derive the health benefits
associated with such activities.'

They add that it's a fallacy that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or
damage to an unborn baby stating 'women should be advised that adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are not increased
for exercising women.'

Fears that a baby will be shaken and distressed in the womb are misguided as a baby is well-insulated by fluid to protect it.

RCOG explain that exercising while pregnant has numerous benefits for the
mother's health and wellbeing.

'Maternal
 benefits appear to be both physical and psychological in nature. Many 
common complaints of pregnancy, including fatigue, varicosities
and swelling of extremities, are reduced in women who exercise. 
Additionally, active women experience less insomnia,
stress, anxiety and depression,' they state.

Women who exercise while pregnant will also gain less excess weight, lowering
the health risks associated with obesity.

Speaking about whether it's safe to 
run while pregnant, maternal health expert Sheeva Talebian, M.D., told 
Women's Running: 'Running is safe anytime - during the first, second and 
third trimester - if you are having an uncomplicated pregnancy.

'You should not run if you have 
complications like elevated blood pressure or, in some cases, multiple 
gestation, that would cause an obstetrician to advise no high-impact 
exercise.

'Just because you're pregnant doesn’t
 mean you can’t stay in shape. All of the same reasons you normally 
exercise - heart health, stress reduction, weight maintenance, lower 
blood pressure - are reasons to run during pregnancy.

'Additionally, women who exercise 
while pregnant have lower rates of diabetes and preeclampsia, and they 
are less likely to gain an unhealthy (and potentially dangerous) amount 
of weight. There's even some data that suggests babies born to women who
 worked out while expecting have stronger cardiovascular systems.'
