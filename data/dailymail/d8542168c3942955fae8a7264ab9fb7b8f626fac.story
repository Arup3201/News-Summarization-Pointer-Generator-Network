The incident occurred during Tarlov's trip to buy her daughter a birthday gift, sources told the newspaper.

Marshall shouted at Tarlov to move while pedaling in the car lane, a source told the newspaper. 

The source added that Marshall 'admits to being in the wrong lane, and The New York Post reported Marshall 'remained at the scene.'

Phillip Fenton, 21, who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the newspaper 'It didn't look like he tried to stop.'

Another witness, Tom Longman, told the newspaper 'The right side of [Tarlov's] face looked really bad. There was blood all over her.'

'She was my wife. She was the best,' Tarlov's husband Michael Wittman said to The New York Daily News. 'She was walking in Central Park. We don't know if she had the light or he did....she was in the crosswalk.'
