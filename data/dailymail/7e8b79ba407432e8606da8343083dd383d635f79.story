Gone are the days of naming pets Spot, Mutt and Patch. In their place are Charlie, Alfie and Ruby

For many pet owners, their dogs and cats are as much a part of the family as the human beings.

So much so that when it comes to deciding what to call them, traditional choices such as Fido and Felix have given way to fashionable baby names.

A study of more than 50,000 pet names has found that the most popular for both cats and dogs was Poppy – which was also the 13th most popular name for a baby girl last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Gone are the days of naming pets Spot, Mutt and Patch. In their place are Charlie, Alfie and Ruby – three names that appear in the top 20 list for both babies and pets.

The decline of traditional names is demonstrated by the fate of Rover and Fido, which were both in the top ten in the 1970s but have fallen to 840 and 1,480 respectively in the study by John Lewis Pet Insurance.

The Harry Potter books, children’s TV and celebrity choices seem to set the trend for our four-legged friends.

Popular names for dogs include Charlie and Lola, from the BBC CBeebies cartoon series; Peppa, from Peppa Pig; Dora, from Dora The Explorer; Woody from the Toy Story films; Winnie, from Winnie The Pooh; and Minnie, after Minnie Mouse. 

Harry Potter inspires both cat and dog lovers with Harry, Luna Lovegood, Dumbledore, Fleur Delacour, Draco, Lupin, Severus and Dudley all appearing on the list.

Dog owners have also copied names picked by celebrities for their children, with the list including Florence, daughter of David and Samantha Cameron; Flynn, son of Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr; Kai, son of Wayne and Coleen Rooney; and Harper, daughter of David and Victoria Beckham.

Some cat owners appear to find inspiration in history, with Einstein, Darwin, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Leonardo da Vinci and Boudicca all popular.
