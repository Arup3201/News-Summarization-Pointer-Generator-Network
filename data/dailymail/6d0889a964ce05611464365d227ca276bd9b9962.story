Recorder Philip Cattan is alleged to have fallen asleep during the trial at Manchester Crown Court

A rape trial has collapsed after claims a senior judge fell asleep while an alleged child abuse victim was giving evidence.

Respected Manchester barrister, Recorder Philip Cattan, who sits as a judge part-time, was seen to ‘nod off’ as the under-age victim answered questions from the defence.

Following concerns he had missed vital evidence during the case - which is already set to cost the taxpayer £10,000 - barristers said they wanted to raise a ‘point of law’.

While the jury was out of the room, the judge was confronted with the claim that he had slept through part of the cross-examination of the witness, who was giving evidence via videolink because of her age.

The incident was witnessed by the family of the alleged victim in the trial of John Quigley, which was expected to last five days.

The decision was then taken to abandon the trial, which began on Monday at Manchester Crown Court and the jury was discharged.

The girl giving evidence was the first of two young girls expected to testify that they were abused in offences spanning from 2006 to 2013.

She will now have to give evidence a second time when the case is re-listed for next month before a different judge.

John Quigley, 49, from Manchester, faces charges of rape of a child under 13, sexual assault of a child under 13, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and four counts of assault by penetration.

A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘The jury has been discharged in the trial of R v John Quigley at Manchester Crown Court following an issue that arose in court during the cross examination of the first complainant in the case.

‘The trial will be re-listed as soon as possible. The complainants and other witnesses have been kept informed.’

Leading criminal barrister, Kama Melly, who specialises in child sex crime, told the Daily Mirror: ‘It is devastating for a victim to have a trial delayed so long while an investigation takes place.

‘This is no doubt a traumatic time for the family and this will only serve to make matters worse for them.’

She added: ‘There have been cases where a member of the jury has been caught sleeping. In those cases an investigation has to be carried out to find out how much evidence has been missed and if there needs to be a retrial.’

Recorder Cattan, from Cheshire, has so far been unable to comment on the matter.

His role as recorder means he sits for up to thirty days a year as a judge and he has previously overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots and major drugs cases.

He now faces an inquiry after a complaint was made to the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office.

A spokesman said: ‘The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office is aware of the allegation that Recorder Philip Cattan fell asleep during a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

‘The matter is being considered in accordance with the Judicial Conduct Rules 2013.’

An investigation was launched in 2001 after another judge nodded off during a rape trial.

Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, fell asleep during the trial of Lee Woodward, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl on a riverbank in Sharpness, Gloucestershire.

He was granted bail and a retrial was demanded where he was cleared.

Judge Hutton, now retired, was ordered to apologise for the incident.
