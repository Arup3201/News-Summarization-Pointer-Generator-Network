A 16-month-old girl was sent back to her 'paralytic' mother hours after she had abandoned her, an inquest has heard.

Chloe Valentine was four when she died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012.

But social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest on Monday she considered removing Chloe in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother Ashlee Polkinghorne left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach.

Chloe's grandmother reluctantly agreed to take her but when an angry and abusive Polkinghorne finally surfaced, a supervisor decided Chloe should be returned to her mother.

Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night.

She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver.

She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications.

'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked.

Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne.

'It took me by surprise but I had faith in my supervisor ... (to make) tough calls in tough situations,' she said.

'When you're caught up in the moment, you can get over-emotional.'

The inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect.

Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old.

After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne.

Polkinghorne, 22, and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced her to ride the motorbike over three days, which lead to the four year old's death who had massive head injuries.

Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use.

One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food.

It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends.

In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs.

Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months

Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 

Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home.

The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking.

Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house.

Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. 

Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother.

But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships.

Ms Polkinghorne and Mr McPartland, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect.

The inquest continues.
