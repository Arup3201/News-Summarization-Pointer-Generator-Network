An alleged benefits cheat claimed she was afraid of open spaces and unable to leave her house while living a 'champagne lifestyle' across the world, a court has heard.

Tracey Johnson, 52, claimed £50,000 in benefits - including cold weather payments - while on a holiday in Argentina, prosecutors said.

While on her trips, where she worked as an author and tour guide, Johnson even wrote diary entries describing 'relaxing' palm tree views, and referring to her destination as 'like Miami with saris', Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court was told.

The court was also told of alleged social media posts describing preferred brands of Argentinian champagne, and boasting that lunch in a spa would costs the locals two weeks' wages.

Jurors also heard how Johnson took a four-month trip to India while claiming on benefits claims forms that she had not left the UK for more than four weeks.

Prosecutors read from a diary allegedly written while Johnson was living in Goa on a four-month jaunt.

A jury heard she wrote: 'First thought: so relaxing, palm trees swaying. Second
 thought: people who come here and think it's India have made a big 
mistake - it's not like India it's like Miami with saris.'

Johnson
 is accused of claiming disability benefits while travelling the world 
writing travel guides, cookbooks and steamy novels.

Jurors were also shown photographs of Johnson posing in wide open spaces at tourist spots in Argentina, as well as behind the wheel of a car designed for countries which drive on the right.

A court heard how Johnson claimed she couldn't walk and was a 'prisoner in her own home'.

But
 the jury was told she posted on Facebook: 'I am one spoilt girl. Early 
lunch in the Himalaya Spa. Lunch here would be two week's wages in 
India.'

When benefits investigators tried to 
look in to her affairs after the claims - which total £48,427.24 - they 
were met with a wall of silence, jurors heard.

Kim Obsourne, an investigator for the Department of Work and Pensions, said: 'She has never given us an explanation.'

Johnson is 
accused of claiming benefits while travelling to destinations including Spain and New 
York and setting up her own tour company called Northwest Nomads in 
Argentina.

Johnson's self-written profiles from the internet were read to the jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court.

One said: 'I went to Argentina because I'm a dancer and wanted to learn the tango. Buenos Aires was so magical, I could not get her out of my head, like a new lover.'

The court heard while in Argentina Johnson wrote a novel called The Last Tango in Buenos Aires.

Prosecutor Joanna James read Johnson's LinkedIn profile to the court.

It said: 'I am an author, photographer and tour director of Northwest Nomads from 2002 to the present time. "I am the author of The Last Tango in Buenos Aires, various travel guides and cookbooks.

'I am a fine art photographer, fine art wedding photographer and boudoir photographer.'

The court heard Johnson, of Frome, Somerset, was arrested after an anonymous tip-off about her alleged worldwide travels.

Prosecutor Miss James said: 'Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hard working tax payers could only dream of.

'Unable to live': The court heard Johnson rarely spoke to other people or went outside, and couldn't live in her own home

'It was absolute, blatant dishonesty.'

The
 court heard Johnson had allegedly filled in benefits claim forms saying
 she needed physical and emotional support for agoraphobia, depression, 
hallucinations, anxiety, blackouts and post traumatic stress disorder.

She
 wrote on a form: 'I have severe agoraphobia and am entirely housebound.
 I am too afraid to go out, I can't go into a shop or office, I am 
afraid of other people.

'I have panic attacks, can't breath, I hallucinate, my legs give way in panic. I have a constant fear of other people, I need support to protect me from the world outside.

'I am a prisoner at home because it's the only place where I'm safe. I sleep or rest in the chair all day - I have to lie down because I'm too tired to get up.'

Johnson
 is accused of fraud, dishonestly making a false representation and 
dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances between January,
 2008 and July, 2012.

She is representing herself, and denies all 13 charges. The trial continues.
