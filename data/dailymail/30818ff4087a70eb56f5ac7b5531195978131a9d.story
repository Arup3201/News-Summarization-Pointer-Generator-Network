The heartbroken 6-year-old son of a Utah police officer looked on as nearly 10,000 people gathered in the Maverick Center outside of Salt Lake City to honor his father, who was senselessly shot last week in the line of duty.

Ben Johnson and his mother, Shante Johnson, held flags in honor of their father and husband (respectively), as six Draper police officers escorted the flag-covered casket of Sergeant Derek Johnson - who authorities say was fatally shot by a pair of drug addicts on Sunday - to the front of an arena packed with fellow officers, family, friends and supporters.

Meanwhile, 34-year-old former model Traci Vaillancourt - who lost her looks and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - and her boyfriend, Timothy 'Troy' Walker, are recovering from their own, self-inflicted wounds in police custody.

Off the rails: Victoria King, Vaillancourt's sister said she lost her to prescription drugs some years ago

Vaillancourt was allegedly shot in the 
back by Walker while sitting in their Volvo in Draper, Utah, just 
moments after Walker is accused of shooting dead Draper City Sergeant Derek Johnson.

Walker then turned the weapon on himself
and has been hospitalized alongside his long-term partner since. They 
are both in a critical condition.

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Johnson’s wife, Shante Sidwell Johnson, wearing black, carried the couple’s 6-year-old son, "little buddy" Bensen Ray.

Draper Police Chief Bryan Roberts, who 
conducted the service, told the thousands filling the Maverik Center: 'It’s inspiring to stand here in front of you. Your support gives me 
strength.'

Police are waiting to speak to 
Vaillancourt to hear her account of what happened and to find out if she
knew about her boyfriend's intention to kill.

Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly.

Speaking in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend.

Accused: Timothy Walker allegedly shot Sgt. Derek Johnson dead before turning the gun on his girlfriend and himself

After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com.

She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30.

'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster.

'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.'

'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added.

King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior.

'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said.

The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister.

Detectives are now waiting at Intermountain Medical Center, where the couple are being treated to question them about the shooting.

They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother.

Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction.

'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper.

According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'.

She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car.

She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 

'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview.

'I just want them to know I’m sorry'.

Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday.

Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent.

Sgt Johnson, 32, a father-of-one will be buried on Friday.

Happily married: Derek Johnson grew up in Draper and married his high school sweetheart. He was described as a dedicated police officer

'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.'

He was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen.

'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend. He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads.

The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field.

The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory.

'There's no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it wasn't in vain.'

The local sheriff Jim Winder says Walker had a desire to shoot a uniformed officer.
