Abandoned: The girl had been locked in the flat with a plate of crisps and the TV on (picture unrelated)

A mother who left her baby daughter unsupervised with nothing but a plate of crisps to feed herself, has walked free from court after a judge declared the child 'well fed'.

The 20-month-old toddler had been left locked in a flat all day with crisps and a bottle of juice, while the mother went to work.

The woman admitted child cruelty, but received a suspended sentence after the judge said the baby was ‘well fed’.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Wolverhampton Crown Court today that she had left the baby alone ‘on many occasions’ when she went to work.

The child was found after a bailiff, who was attending a neighbouring home, heard crying from the flat and called the police.

Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court the child was able to roam around the flat, although the kitchen and toilet doors were closed for safety, and the TV had been left on.

The woman, from Sandwell, West Midlands, was told by the judge that her reason for leaving her 'vulnerable' child unsupervised was no mitigation for serious misconduct.

However, due to the fact that the flat was clean and the baby had food, the mother was not imprisoned.

Judge Helen Hughes said: ‘You deliberately left your baby at home on her own.

‘You did it on many occasions and I do not accept you made proper arrangements for her care.'

Freed: The woman was given a six-month suspended prison sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court and the child was taken into care

She added: ‘But I do accept the child was well fed, the flat was clean and she had food and drink.

‘She was only 20 months old, and she was vulnerable.’

Kate Thomas, defending, emphasised that the mother had not left the child to go partying or drinking and maintained she had on many other occasions employed people to look after the toddler.

The mother was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and was placed under supervision for a year.

The child has been taken into care by social services.
