The Vatican appears to be backtracking over a landmark document which said gay people had 'gifts and qualities' to offer the Catholic church after an outcry from conservative bishops.

The paper - which also supported unmarried couples and divorcees - was hailed as a step forward by campaigners when it was released yesterday as part of a two-week Vatican summit on family life.

But today conservatives at the conference came out fighting, accusing the paper of 'manipulating' their views - and the Vatican later issued a statement stressing it was only a 'work in progress'.

Attack: Conservatives including U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke (centre) came out fighting today against a landmark Vatican document which said gay and lesbian people had 'gifts and qualities' to offer the church

Moderniser: Pope Francis (pictured leaving the synod of 200 bishops yesterday) famously said last year: 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?'. The conference will end on Sunday

Study: The discussions have largely been conducted behind closed doors in the walled-off state inside Rome

Catholic leaders in Rome added the paper will be amended by the time it emerges in its final form, after the synod of 200 bishops ends on Sunday.

The development will come as a blow to campaigners who welcomed the statement as part of what they considered Pope Francis' increasing acceptance of people once shunned by the church.

The pontiff famously said last year: 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?'

He was named person of the year after taking office by Time magazine, which said he had pulled the papacy 'out of the palace and into the streets'. 

The synod - the first held about the family since 1980 - said unmarried couples living together can be 'positive' and couples' decisions on the use of contraception should be respected.

Bishops had called for 'courageous' new ways to help families, especially those 'damaged' by divorce. 

And their document asked rhetorically if the church was ready to provide them a place 'accepting and valuing their sexual orientation without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony.'

Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry, described the move as 'a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time'.

But today the head of the Polish bishops' conference, Cardinal Stanislaw Gadecki, called the paper 'unacceptable' and a deviation from church teaching.

Hard-line American Cardinal Raymond Burke, the head of the Vatican's supreme court, claimed the Vatican was releasing 'manipulated' information about the goings-on of the synod.

'While the document purports to report only the discussion
which took place among the synod fathers, it, in fact, advances
positions which many synod fathers do not accept', he told
The Catholic World report.

'A great number of the synod fathers found it
objectionable'.

Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa added: 'It is not what we are saying at all... It is not a true message.

'The message has gone out that this is what the synod is
saying, that this is what the Catholic Church is saying ...
Whatever we say hereafter will seem like we're doing damage
control.'

Cardinal Reinhard Marx of Germany, however, hit back at the conservatives - calling the document 'an honest representation of how the debate developed'. 

The comments came out after the Vatican's summary of today's debate, which happened behind closed doors without media scrutiny.

According to the summary, bishops suggested the final version of the report should highlight faithful, Catholic families to avoid 'a near-exclusive focus on imperfect family situations.'

On gay Catholics, they said 'prudence' was required 'so that the impression of a positive evaluation of such a tendency on the part of the church is not created.

'The same care was advised with regard to cohabitation.'

The bishops also noted that the word 'sin' barely appeared in the document at all. 

Today's summary also noted some bishops firmly believe there is no room for change on the issue of whether Catholics who divorce and remarry, without getting an annulment, can receive Communion.

Current teaching says these Catholics are living in sin so cannot receive the sacraments.  

Serious issues: Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller arrives for a morning session of a two-week synod today

Seat of power: The debates have been taking place in Vatican City, the church's walled state within Rome

Yesterday's document was written by a committee of bishops after a week of
speeches. Participants have now
broken down into 10 small discussion groups to submit changes.

The final version will serve for further reflection among
Catholics around the world over the next 12 months and as the
cornerstone of a second and final synod on the family next year.

Monsignor Bruno Forte, appointed by the pope as the synod's special secretary, wrote the section on gay Catholics.

He is an Italian theologian whose writings have pushed the envelope on keeping true to church doctrine while showing mercy to people in 'irregular' unions.

James Taylor, head of policy for the British gay rights charity Stonewall, insisted the move was still a positive one.

He told MailOnline: 'The backlash was inevitable - we've seen it in the church in the UK and in other countries.

'I think it still shows that progress is being made by people of faith towards acceptance.

'We broadly welcome what's come out of the Vatican in the last 24 hours and we welcome the fact that the church is now recognising there are many people in loving same-sex relationships.

'However, we do hope they will turn attention to dealing with prejudice that gay and lesbian people face around the world - often in the name of religion.'
