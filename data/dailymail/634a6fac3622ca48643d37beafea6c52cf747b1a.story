Brendan Rodgers has a riddle to solve: how does he keep Liverpool one of the most potent sides in Europe without one of the best players in the world?

Slowly but surely, we are starting to see the answer he will provide. Moving on without Luis Suarez, the man who provided 31 goals last season and perpetual threat, is going to be a challenge but that is not to say Liverpool will stall without him.

Pace and penetration from all areas is what Rodgers wants to see from his side in the new campaign, with the goals and threat being shared out and at times during their latest friendly – a 1-0 win over Olympiacos, secured by Raheem Sterling’s goal – you saw how it might all fit together.

First 
Rodgers had Steven Gerrard dropping deep, acting like a quarterback in a
 stadium synonymous with American football. To his sides, Emre Can and 
Jordan Henderson provided energy, while up front Daniel Sturridge, Lazar
 Markovic and Sterling kept Liverpool explosive.

There
 will, inevitably, be adjustments made to this line-up before their new 
campaign begins on August 17, not least as a new £20million defender in 
Dejan Lovren needs to slot in, but this might just have been a glimpse 
of the Liverpool of the future.

Clearly,
 it is impossible to say at such an early stage whether this new look 
squad will be superior to the group Suarez inspired before his 
£75m sale to Barcelona, but Rodgers unquestionably has a plan, one
 that he believes will keep Liverpool on the front foot.

That
 is how they started their campaign in the grandly titled Guinness 
International Tournament; Olympiacos couldn’t contain them in the 
opening 10 minutes, as Sterling, Markovic and Sturridge scurried 
forward, constantly running beyond the Greek defence.

Sterling
 opened the scoring after five minutes, dashing into the danger zone to 
feed on the scraps after Sturridge, who had been set free by Gerrard, 
scuffed a shot that cannoned off Eric Abidal and fell invitingly at the 
England forward’s feet.

A
 few more goals should have followed before half-time. Liverpool have 
only been in training for three weeks – some of this starting line-up 
only returned last Monday – but they looked sharper and more nimble than
 their opponents in the stifling 28 degree heat.

First
 Markovic sped inside two tackles before curling his shot over the bar; 
next Henderson almost burst through after Sterling and Markovic had 
impressively combined, while Gerrard fired a series of dangerous set 
plays into the area.  

Olympiakos,
 by contrast, offered no threat and their physical approach was 
illustrated by the fact Dimitris Siovas and Do Carmo Salino were booked 
for crude challenges. Javier Saviola, meanwhile, was shown a yellow card
 after he dived to win a penalty.

As
 is always the case with these games, a raft of changes followed in the 
second half. Olympiacos almost found a way back into the match, when 
Gevorg Ghazaryan cracked a drive against the crossbar in the 50th minute
 but that was the only scare Liverpool had.

If
 anything, they had more opportunities to win. The best fell to Rickie 
Lambert, whose right-footed drive in the 75th minute was beaten away by 
Olympiacos keeper Balazs Megyeri, while Philippe Coutinho found the 
side-netting with a powerful effort from 20 yards.

Even
 though there were no further goals, a crowd of 36,170 saw Liverpool 
take a definite step forward on their performance when they lost 1-0 to 
Roma in Boston and Rodgers will be looking for more of the same again 
when they return to New York for the first time in 10 years to play 
Manchester City.

City,
 of course, are the standard-bearers back in the Premier League but the 
game may yet be revealing to see where Liverpool now stand in relation 
to the champions. Two points separated them last May – Rodgers will be 
hoping the changes he has made will bridge that gap.

After the game, Rodgers said: 'I'm evaluating the fitness of the players but I was delighted with the team.

'We will get sharper but at the minute we are building up the resistance. Our passing was crisp and precise and I was also pleased with how we defended. Overall I was delighted.'

Rodgers also paid tribute to Sturridge and was excited by the impact Markovic made.

'I have seen a difference in Dan and I think he's ready to be the main man,' he added. 'He has come back from the World Cup looking really sharp. Markovic looked exciting and Sterling was a joy to watch.'

Liverpool's move to sign striker Loic Remy broke down earlier in the day, and Rodgers added: 'We are disappointed for the player but we have to move on. We have made a decision.'
