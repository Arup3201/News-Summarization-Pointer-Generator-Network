American Apparel's controversial founder is planning a dramatic return to the cash-strapped company days after he was fired over a string of sexual harassment lawsuits.

Dov Charney has joined forces with a private equity firm and is planning a takeover bid that values the company at $1.30 to $1.40 a share, the New York Post reported.

Sources told the paper that the firm, who's identity is yet to be confirmed, wrote to American Apparel's board of directors to confirm its interest in buying the clothing retailer.

Buyout bid: Dov Charney has allegedly joined forces with a private equity firm and is planning a takeover bid that values the company at $1.30 to $1.40 a share

It is the second such approach by the equity company in the past few weeks, according to the paper.

'This whole episode has a lot less to do with pictures of naked women, and a whole lot more to do with a power struggle,' a source told the Post, referring to the board's allegations that Charney allowed a blogger to post nude photos of a former employee who was suing the company in 2011.

The Wall Street Journal today named private-equity firm Irving Place Capital as having made a move to buy out American Apparel. It is not clear whether that is the same company allegedly associated with Charney.

It comes days after American Apparel fired Charney and named longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider to be its next CEO.

Final decision: American Apparel said on Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee'

The Los Angeles-based company's board voted to oust Mr Charney as CEO in June, citing allegations of misconduct. He was put under suspension this summer, but still served as a consultant to the company. 

American Apparel said on Tuesday that it has terminated his position 'for cause' after an internal investigation.  

Ms Schneider said in an interview: 'I'm very, very excited to be part of something that is such a big influence on pop culture and helps so many Americans.'

Calling American Apparel 'the largest manufacturer of apparel in North America,' she added: 'There are a lot of jobs and a lot of people, and we want to keep that going.'

American Apparel, which Mr Charney founded in 1998, manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. It is famous for selling American-made goods and for its risque advertising.

The Montreal-born Mr Charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers.

In 2011, a former employee accused Mr Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise.

She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' 

In 2012, Mr Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him.

Mr Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Mr Bumblis was later fired from his job.

Moving on: Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider (left, in 2004), formerly of Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria, has been named as the retailer's next CEO

American Apparel said Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided, based on the results of an internal investigation conducted by FTI Consulting, that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee.'

The company has suffered financially. It has recorded annual losses since 2010 and reported three quarterly losses this year. Its stock has dropped 53per cent in 2014.

Ms Schneider, who officially starts as CEO on January 5, has been a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria.

She said in a statement that she hopes to 'make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, Made in USA manufacturing philosophy.'

American Apparel has operated under two interim CEOs since Mr Charney's ouster, most recently Scott Brubaker, who will continue in that role through the end of the year.

Shares rose 5 cents, or 8.6per cent, to 63 cents in after-hours trading. The stock closed up 3 cents at 58 cents on Tuesday.
