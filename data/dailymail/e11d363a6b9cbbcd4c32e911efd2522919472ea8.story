Kylie Bretag was locked up in a detention centre in Mexico since October 20 and finally arrived home to her family on Monday

An Australian woman who was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate her birthday and graduation, who then got locked up in a Mexican detention centre has finally returned home to her family.

Kyle Bretag arrived in Canberra on Monday after more than a week spent in appalling conditions at the detention centre in Tenosique, a small town north of Guatemala.

The 30-year-old from Melbourne was arrested by Mexican officials while passing a checkpoint on a bus on October 20 after she was caught travelling in the country without a visa. 

Ms Bretag crossed the border from California into Mexico on foot to celebrate her 30th birthday with friends early last month, but her passport wasn't stamped so it essentially made her an illegal.

She spoke to The Project on channel ten on Tuesday about her ordeal , where she was forced to spend 11 days in cramped jail cells with 20 other woman and children.

Ms Wayt said her friend had crossed the border from San Diego to Mexico on foot after hearing that it was cheaper than flying online. She was then arrested while on a bus in Tenosique, north of Guatemala

‘There were a lot of moments when I thought it would just go on for a lot longer than it did,' she said. 

Ms Bretag said being back on home soil was incredible.

'It is a little bitter sweet, but it’s more sweet than bitter.’ 

‘Being with mum and dad is fantastic and just the relief of being on home soil is fantastic.’

Seemingly not too angry about her ordeal now, she did say while in the cell a language barrier proved difficult to cope with.

‘They were just trying to do their job and I was just in this cell with a lot of other people and nobody spoke English so I was very isolated and I was devastated, I read a lot.’ 

And communication was frustrating.

‘Everyday I would speak to the lady at the embassy and she would say this is probably what's going to happen today to the best of her understanding,' she told The Project.

'Then I would have the immigration people tell me in broken English, a completely different plan of what would happen that day or when I was going to leave and each day that would be changed to the next day or the next afternoon .’

Ms Bretag was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate both her 30th birthday and graduation from her communications degree 

‘The eleven days that I was there felt like a lifetime.’

When asked if she was scared of her time spent in the Mexican detention centre, Ms Bretag she never felt in that position but was worried about what was going to happen.

'I was completely powerless to do anything about it,' she said.

As for whether she will venture back to Mexico for another holiday, no doubt.

'Absolutely, I have to finish what I started, I was having such a good time.’

Natalie Wayt, a friend of Ms Bretag's who was on her way to meet the recent graduate in Cancun before she was locked up, earlier told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Bretag had crossed the border between San Diego and Mexico on foot in order to save money.

'Some travel websites says that if you want to save money go to San Diego and walk the border.'

'It's actually very common, people from the US do it all the time. They just go down there and have lunch and then come back,' Ms Wayt said 

Ms Wayt said her friend had asked an official to stamp her passport when entering the country but, 'he didn't say anything, just waved her on'

'She even asked an official down there, because she had her passport in her hand, she asked him where she could get it stamped and he didn't say anything, just waved her on. There was a massive language barrier.'

Fortunately for Ms Bretag, during her ordeal she was able to keep in contact with Ms Wayt and her family at home via a mobile phone. 

Ms Wayte put Ms Bretag's situation on social media in a bid to help her get out of jail although that didn't have much pull with Mexican authorities. 

While held in the detention centre, she said her friend just wanted to go home.

'She told me: 'I just want to go home, I'm living a nightmare',' Ms Wayt said.

Both her mother Colleen and Ms Wayt said staff at the detention centre continued to promise Ms Bretag that she will be deported and relocated on certain dates, and yet she continued to be held in Tenosique.

On conditions in the cell, Ms Bretag told Ms Wayt that she was sleeping on one of the numerous small mats that line the ground in a row on the floor, 

She also said she had little time to bathe in the facility with no privacy and described the shower as 'a box with a hole in it' with the water being supplied in buckets filled with recycled water from the sinks.

It's believed while she was locked up the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided consular assistance to Ms Bretag, according to The Age. 

Ms Bretag was being kept in a crowded cell with up to 20 other women, no clean water to bathe with and is sleeping on a thin mat on the floor

Ms Wayt has begun a media campaign in order to ensure and speed up her friend's release from detention
