As she celebrates her third birthday today, Blue Ivy Carter has already had more glamorous experiences than most of us could hope for in a lifetime.

Thanks to her super rich and famous parents, Beyonce and Jay Z, Blue Ivy has toured the world, appeared in pop videos and taken to the stage at the MTV Awards.

Life is definitely a beach for the toddler who has been snapped by the sea in exotic locations including Jamaica, the Bahamas and the South of France.

Idyllic: The little girl pictured by the pool at another exotic location

Most recently, the little girl was pictured stroking a tiger cub as she enjoyed a holiday in Thailand with her popstar parents. The family stayed in a $25,000-a-night, $35-million villa in Phuket before moving on to Cambodia for some more sightseeing.  

Fitting into her mother and father's A-list lifestyle, Blue Ivy is flown everywhere with them via private jet in her designer togs.

She gains VIP access wherever she goes allowing her to to make The Louvre in Paris her private playground or attend film premieres for must-see children's movies.

When she hangs out backstage on her mother's world tour, she can sit her own monogrammed director's chair.

Doting: Beyonce and Jay Z love to lavish their daughter with gifts including a custom-made $80,000 diamond-encrusted Barbie doll on her last birthday

It hasn't been revealed what present the diminutive diva will receive on her birthday today but she certainly won't get a Christmas-birthday combo gift like others whose big day falls in early January. 

In previous years, Blue Ivy has been lavished with a custom-made $80,000 diamond-encrusted Barbie doll and a $30,000 Windmill Playhouse. 

Meanwhile at her princess themed birthday party last year, she was joined by her mother's showbiz pals including Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland.

Of course there's no expense spared on her wardrobe and Blue Ivy's designer clothes include a pair of Tom Ford shoes and beautiful dresses from Jean Paul Gaultier and Chloe.  

Blue Ivy could easily have her own music career one day thanks to her parent's connections in the industry and the high chance she's inherited their musical talents. But regardless of whether she follows in their footsteps, she's already appeared in the charts.

Her cries can be heard in Jay Z's hit Glory while she also inspired and features in her mother's track Blue and starred in the accompanying video.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce revealed that her daughter made her life 'complete' when she arrived three years ago.

She said: 'My story did not feel complete and I didn't know why but ... after I gave birth I looked at my diaries and everything made sense.

'I have my best friend. She is hilarious and beautiful,’ she said of Blue Ivy. 

As their first born gets older, rumours are rife that the couple will soon have another child - especially when pictures are taken of Beyonce from an unflattering angle.

Both Beyonce and Jay Z have said they would love to give Blue Ivy a brother or sister one day.
