Neymar has everything needed to eclipse the talents of Lionel Messi and be heralded as the greatest player on the planet, believes 1994 Brazil World Cup winner Romario.

Neymar played an integral part in the tournament hosts' run to the World Cup semi-finals this summer, scoring four goals before suffering a back injury in their quarter-final win against Colombia.

In the 22-year-old's absence, the five-time World Cup winners were thumped 7-1 against eventual winners Germany - who beat a Messi-led Argentina 1-0 in the final after extra-time.

And Romario believes this summer's defeat at the Maracana, could have been Messi's best chance of winning the tournament while citing the fact Neymar still has time on his side to leave a lasting legacy on the world's biggest stage before he retires.

'He has everything to be bigger than Messi,' the legendary striker said of his compatriot in an interview with Revista Trip.

'Messi is already a part of history but Neymar can make an even bigger impact.

'Messi may not have another World Cup in which to compete and win, but Neymar has three or four more to contest.'
