Australian of the Year Rosie Batty has launched a revolutionary app for young women to help them understand the warning signs of abusive and controlling relationships.

Ms Batty became an anti-domestic violence campaigner after her 11-year-old son Luke was murdered on a cricket pitch in Victoria by his father one year ago on Valentines Day. She said the Doncare's iMatter app will help educate women about different forms of domestic violence, increase awareness and support them to make safe choices.

'I think throughout our communities, at any age, we're learning it's not just about physical violence,' she said.

'Violence is also psychological, which includes verbal.

'It's not just about wearing a black eye and physical harm, it's far more complex than that.'

Ms Batty said she was aged 40 when she realised it wasn't her fault.

'It was violence and no one ever deserves it,' she said.

Research shows 22 per cent of girls under 20 have experienced dating violence.

The interactive iMatter app is also aimed a promoting self-esteem, and conversations between young people about healthy relationship behaviour.

'If you're approaching a relationship when you have no self-esteem you're most likely to enter into a toxic relationship,' Ms Batty said.

'It will not get better, it will wear you down and will reduce you to a very low point.'

The app, which includes images, clips, quizzes and articles, is now live.

It enables users to share and save content and use the app as a journal.

Doncare clinical director Carmel O'Brien said it was like driving lessons for relationships.

'We hear again and again from young people that they are putting up with things in relationships that are really very disrespectful and sometimes frightening,' she said. 

Just a few days before the first anniversary of her son's death, Ms Batty penned a touching tribute on the Luke Batty Foundation's Facebook page, which recounted the day he died

Just a few days before the first anniversary of her son's death, Ms Batty penned a touching tribute on the Luke Batty Foundation's Facebook page, which recounted the day he died.

'You were animated and pleased when you came over and spoke to me for the last time. You asked me if you could spend a few extra minutes with dad practising your cricket. You knew your cricket was improving and you were proud of how you had begun to play. It had all started to come together for you,' the heart-wrenching post read.

'Then I heard your father, ran to where you both were, which was only metres away and saw you injured and lying on the ground. I panicked and ran to get an ambulance - never to see you or speak to you again.'

'And now a year later I think of you from the moment I open my eyes until I lay my head back down on my pillow. I think of you every moment of every day. I dream about you and wake knowing that the dream I had is not as bad as the reality of waking to find that you're still gone and can never return.'
