All babies born in  Britain could have the EU flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years.

Eric
Pickles said there was nothing he could do to prevent the emblem from 
replacing the royal crest on birth, marriage and death certificates.

The
Communities Secretary warned the move was part of a Brussels plot to 
brand people as European citizens ‘from cradle to grave’.

From cradle to grave: All British birth, death and marriage certificates will be stamped with EU flag from next year

He said the plan, contained in the 
Lisbon Treaty, was part of an insidious campaign to stamp the EU flag 
across all tiers of public administration and undermine nation states.

His warning came after the EU unveiled new identikit blue-and- yellow certificates emblazoned with the 12-star flag.

They will have legal force across the continent from early next year.

For
now, these will be available alongside national certificates, so 
parents will be able to ask for either a British certificate or a 
European one.

The idea is to make it easier for migrants to move around Europe.

Brussels has not yet demanded that EU certificates become compulsory, but Mr Pickles said it was only a matter of time.

Anti EU plan: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles called the move a 'Brussels plot'

He used the example of driving licences, where at first it was optional for countries to put the 12-star EU symbol on new documents.

Five years later it became mandatory, and in 2011 they were rebranded as ‘European driving licences’.

The EU regulation on birth, marriage and death certificates is due to be reviewed in three years, and sources close to Mr Pickles said they feared it could become compulsory then.

Because it is being implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, which was signed by the last Labour government without a referendum, such a move would not need the say-so of the British parliament.

Moves towards standardised European 
birth certificates will revive memories of the 1980s decision to 
harmonise the design of passports across the EU.

Britain
was forced to drop its popular black hardback design, and replace it 
with a flimsier burgundy version. However, the UK was  at least allowed 
to keep the royal crest on the front.

Mr
Pickles said: ‘From cradle to grave, Britons are now to be stamped with
the EU flag, as Brussels starts interfering in people’s birth, death 
and marriage.

‘This imposed 
Euro-law is part of an aggressive propaganda campaign to bully councils 
and public institutions into flying the EU flag at every opportunity.’

He added: ‘This EU stamp won’t be optional – just look at the Euro-creep of the EU flag ending up on every driving licence.

‘Eurocrats are brazen about their 
political agenda to advance their “European project”, wipe nation states
off the map, and remove the Union Jack and our royal crest from public 
life.’

In future years, the Commission also 
has plans to widen the number of public documents available in European 
form, including those relating to adoption, real estate and the absence 
of a criminal record.

New-born rules: As councils must issue the new documents from next year, all babies born in Britain could have the EU flag stamped on their birth certificate within three years

It 
raises the prospect of Britons having to present an EU document to prove
they do not have a criminal record when they apply for a job.

The birth certificates are part of new EU regulations which will come into force next year.

Tradition: The Royal crest will no longer feature on UK certificates

Using powers granted by the Lisbon 
Treaty, the Commission will order local councils, which administer 
register offices, to offer birth, marriage, civil partnership and death 
certificates with the EU flag at the top.

The multilingual standardised forms are blue and yellow, and are topped with the EU flag.

Languages on the form include German, French and Greek, but there are no national symbols. This means that, in Britain, there is no place for Her Majesty’s coat of arms.

The European Commission has said openly that it wants to promote the idea of European citizenship, and even has a £265million  propaganda budget to support it.

For example, 2013 has been branded the ‘European Year of Citizens’.

Last night a spokesman for the Commission denied that the certificates would be mandatory.

He said the idea was to make it easier for people who move to other EU countries and have to prove their identity.

At present, the different languages on national certificates were causing problems for migrants, he said.

He added: ‘It is plain wrong to suggest that the use of these certificates will become mandatory as the text of the proposal is absolutely clear that the certificates are an optional alternative but not in any way a replacement for national certificates.’
