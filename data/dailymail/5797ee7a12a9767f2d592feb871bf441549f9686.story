A Michelin-star chef and restaurateur has been found dead in a Pennsylvania graveyard with a gunshot wound to his head.

Colin Devlin, 42, who is thought to have had financial problems, was found dead yesterday morning in Chestnut Hill Church Cemetery in Coopersburg.

The married father-of-two had been missing since Wednesday afternoon, when he left his Williamsburg home after being denied a business loan, sources told the New York Daily News.

His wife Kristina Devlin became alarmed when she received a text at 4:18 p.m. asking her to take care of their children, the Wall Street Journal reported.

She told New York City police she thought her husband, who owned popular Williamsburg eateries DuMont and DuMont Burger, was going to their second home in Saylorsburg.

One of his restaurants, the upscale Dressler on Broadway in Williamsburg, recently closed after Devlin was unable to negotiate a new lease according to a website message.

Dressler received a coveted Michelin star in 2007.

Paul F. Hoffman Sr., the chief deputy coroner for Lehigh County, ruled the death was a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police recovered a gun near his body and he said that a note was found in Devlin's car.

Devlin began washing dishes at a catering company in Philadelphia when he was 14, according to the website for DuMont.

He then moved to New York where he worked with celebrated restaurateur Keith McNally at restaurants including Pravda and Balthazar, before opening DuMont in 2001, the website said.

He was still frequently seen in Balthazar after he left.Â 

'We're shocked and devastated. It's a surreal tragedy,' said Polo Dobkin, the chef who anchored the kitchens at all of Mr. Devlin's restaurants before leaving last September told the Wall Street Journal.

'We worked together for over 10 years. I found him to be an inspiring and impassioned owner.'
