A dress worn by Pippa Middleton has been put up for auction in a bid to raise money for The British Heart Foundation.

The red cap-sleeved LK Bennett frock was donated by Pippa herself as part of the charity's Roll Out the Red auction that kicked off  online today, with bidding starting at £100.

The size six garment was pictured on Pippa in June last year when she appeared on the cover of Hello! magazine, announcing her role as ambassador for the charity.

The royal sister's high street styles have a knack for selling out every single time. This red dress worn by Pippa Middelton on the cover of Hello! magazine last year has been put up for auction today to raise money for The British Red Heart foundation.

While we have no doubt that this item will fetch a high price and go to a very happy bidder, we aren't in London to place our bids so we've selected some similar styles that can simply be purchased off the internet.

Nothing quite flatters any skin tone and brightens up a day like a pop of tomato red!

We've found a very similar version with sleeves that is also from L.K. Bennett for $295.00. Our personal favorite is a Diane Von Furstenberg number with a slightly deeper v than Pippa's subtle slit. Don't fret - it's nothing too racy and all of our edits are most certainly royal-worthy.

We also love Victoria Beckham's design with an unusual asymmetric cut-out shoulder and the elegant Kate Spade, cinched-waist sheath with a bow.

With either style, you really can't go wrong. We'll be buying ours first and then hitting the gym to work on getting a matching, royal-worthy derriere!

Pippa has long been a supporter of the heart health charity and last year raised £15,000  taking part in a fundraising bike ride across the US.

Since announcing her role as ambassador she has included it in her work as a columnist, author and editor of Party Pieces in-house title, The Party Times.
