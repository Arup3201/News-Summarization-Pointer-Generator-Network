The President of Afghanistan has personally pardoned a rape victim later jailed for 'adultery by force' - sparking fears she may now marry her attacker to restore her family's honour.

President Hamid Karzai took the highly unusual step of freeing the 21-year-old woman, known as Gulnaz, from Kabul's Badam Bagh jail last night, with no pre-conditions.

She was brutally raped by her husband's cousin in 2008 - who himself was jailed for seven years for the crime - in an assault that left her pregnant.

She was initially sentenced to two years in jail, but which was incredibly increased to 12 on appeal. A first release offer, which she eventually agreed to, staggeringly stipulated she must marry her attacker.

But her lawyer, Kimberley Motley, today said her new found freedom did not actually depend on her going through with the ceremony.

It is now not known whether she intents to proceed with the ritual, which may also see her rapist freed, to restore the honour of her family.

Her lawyer confirmed to the BBC today, however, that she did have a 'safe place' to go, which suggests she may not.

Gulnaz's case attracted international attention after she took part in a documentary film commissioned by the European Union. Its release was later halted.

Motley said she hoped her client would be released shortly, and that there was a place for her in a women's shelter.       

The palace statement said Justice Minister Habibullah Ghalib asked a panel of top legal officials to order her release.

The film in which Gulnaz featured, a documentary on women in prison, was blocked from release by the EU mission in Afghanistan.

They feared it might compromise the safety of the women involved because it showed their identity.          

The film-makers have been pushing for the film to be released, and say Gulnaz wanted her story to be told.      

Film
 director Clementine Malpas said: 'I made a promise to these women that I
 would get their stories out. I am glad that I've been able to honour 
that promise to Gulnaz.

'I
 still hope that our film can be released, so people can hear the 
stories of the other women, and perhaps increase their chance of getting
 justice as well.'

EU 
spokeswoman Lynne O'Donnell welcomed news Gulnaz would be freed but 
declined to comment on whether the film would be 
released.                 

Gulnaz's
 case had been condemned widely by human rights groups. An online 
petition started by Motley has been signed by more than 6,000 people.   

Motley said she is still trying to ascertain whether the attacker will also be released if they agree to marry.

'After assessing Gulnaz's case, (they) decided that her remaining sentence in jail should be pardoned under the current rules and regulations of the country and she should be released,' the palace statement said.      

Gulnaz was initially sentenced to two years in jail, which was later increased to 12 years on appeal. She was given the choice of marriage or serving a jail sentence.

Her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal, and the requirement for her to marry was dropped.            

Gulnaz became pregnant as a result of the attack and gave birth to a daughter in the Badam Bagh women's prison in Kabul almost a year ago.                

Earlier this week, she spoke of her ordeal and the day that started her long nightmare. She said her assailant arrived at the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital.

She told CNN: 'He had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work. He closed doors and windows. I started screaming, but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth.'

And the network also tracked down Gulnaz's rapist, who denied attacking her, but said she would be a likely target if she got out of jail.

He insisted that it would be her family, not his, that may kill her because of the dishonour.

Motley also welcomed what she said was a decision to review the cases of other women in the same jail.           

She said: 'The judiciary has effectively supported the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act by allowing for her to be released, for allowing for her to be pardoned.

'Precedent definitely has been set. As I understand it, the judiciary today was also reviewing the files of other women in Badam Bagh.'

The presidential palace declined to comment on whether other cases were under review.
