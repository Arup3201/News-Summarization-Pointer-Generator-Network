This unlucky chicken was on considerably less than a wing and prayer after being launched into the Siberian Tiger enclosure at a Chinese wildlife park to provide visitors with a bit of light entertainment. 

The unfortunate creature was quickly set-upon by one of the huge tigers who chased it around the snow trying to swat it out of the air with its paws.

The bird managed to give the tiger the run around for a few seconds as it bobbed this way and that, fluttering just inches away from the powerful beast's  razor sharp claws.
