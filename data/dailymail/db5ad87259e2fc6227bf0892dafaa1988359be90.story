Tori Spelling is gearing up for a kinky Christmas. The 41-year-old reality star is more determined than ever to save her seven year marriage to cheating hubby Dean McDermott, even if it means kicking their boring sex life up a naughty notch.

According to a family insider, Tori and Dean, 47,  have been baring it all in therapy lately – with Dean confessing that he needs his wife to be a lot sexier if she wants to make him happy.

‘Dean insists he would never have cheated on Tori had it not been for her dropping the ball when it came to sex,’ says the friend.

‘When they first met, Dean says Tori was a sexy seductress who swept him off his feet with her beguiling ways, and he loved the fact that she was super adventuresome in the bedroom.

‘Strawberries and whipped cream wasn’t just for desert back then,’ adds the friend.

‘But once they celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, Dean felt his wife was more interested in being a mom and homemaker than she was in trying to keep him happy and he longed for the all-night kinky sexathons he and Tori once shared.

‘Gone were the days of giving each other late night sensuous massages and sneaking quickies while the kids napped. And gone were the personal, sexy lap dances Dean used to get from his wife. 

'All of a sudden she was more interested in being a successful actress and doting mom, while he felt ignored.’

The source says that when Tori and Dean had a chance to get away to New York recently and spend a little alone time together, she agreed to pull out all the stops to bring the passion back into their relationship. 

And no sooner did she get home, than she was ordering some sexy new lingerie, and figuring out ways to spice up their sex life.

‘Tori went on line and ordered $2,000 worth of sexy lingerie from Victoria’s Secret,’ says the source. ‘And for the first time in their marriage she also ordered a few kinky sex toys and some steamy adult films.

‘Dean had been after her for a long time to put a lock on their bedroom door, but she was afraid the kids would awake in the middle of the night and need her and be locked out. But in an effort to provide the privacy she and Dean need, she called in a locksmith.

‘Tori also went shopping for candles and she began researching classes that teach women how to strip and pole dance. And she can’t wait to become Dean’s very own private dancer.

‘Tori also agreed that she and Dean would set aside at least one night a month to check into a hotel on their own and she agreed to try some sexy role playing when it comes to spicing up their sex life.

‘Dean was really turned on by Tori’s erotic ideas and he sees it as a real sign that she is not only willing to give him another chance, she’s also willing to become the sexy vixen he first fell in love with.

‘Dean and Tori both acknowledge that a lot of marriages go through the “seven year itch,”’ adds the friend. ‘And while many women aren’t willing to go that extra mile to sex things up with their husbands who’ve cheated, Tori still loves Dean and she’s is pulling out all the stops to make love work.’
