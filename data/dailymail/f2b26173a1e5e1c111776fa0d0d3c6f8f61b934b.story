Music mogul Simon Cowell rescued nine passengers on a sinking boat after receiving a May Day distress call.

The 52-year-old multi-millionaire leapt into action after receiving a call from another vessel off the French south coast near St Tropez.

The drama was revealed on Twitter by Cowell's ex-girlfriend, pop star Sinitta, 43, who is on holiday with the X Factor boss.

After hearing the call, he told his captain and crew to redirect his impressive boat to assist the struggling vessel called Slipstream, reported The Daily Star.

When they came nearer to the boat he sent out a smaller boat to rescue the passengers on board and bring them back to his vessel.

The newspaper reported that his staff also helped to pump water out of Slipstream.

Delivering a minute-by-minute account Sinitta told her followers: 'Just had a mayday message, 35ft boat sinking. Simon has sent us to help and rescue 9 people on board!'

A few minutes later she added: 'Everyone ok, no-one hurt.

'Captain wonâ€™t let boat sink, petrol in sea etc.

'No tide, so hole plugged!'

A source told the Daily Star: 'He only did what any good person would do.

'If his yacht was in trouble he would want someone to come to his rescue. It was just lucky they happened to be close by.'

It is not the first time Cowell has been hailed as a hero - in February he came to the rescue of a father-to-be by giving him a lift home in his private jet so he could get to see the birth of his first child.

Cowell often holidays in the south of France and earlier this month he was spotted lapping up the French sunshine aboard a yacht.

The music mogul was seen grinning at one point and perhaps it's because he could see his good friend David Walliams in the distance.

The Little Britain star and his wife Lara Stone are also in St Tropez and were today spotted boarding Sir Elton John's yacht.

Walliams later tweeted: 'I just mooned Simon Cowell. From a boat. That is true,' before adding: 'And then someone a million times more well known than me mooned Simon Cowell too' which means he could have been referring to the singer himself.
