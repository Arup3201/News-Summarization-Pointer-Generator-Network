The shooting stemmed from a dispute involving the rapper according to a police statement.

Mr Thomas’ daughter Madison Thomas, 3, joined dozens of other mourners to lay flowers and light candles at the scene of the bloodbath on Sunday.

One of the victims, 20-year-old Clarence Young was one of about 100 people who attended a candlelight vigil in front of the shuttered business on Sunday afternoon.

Young was wounded in his right shoulder and said he was at the club for a friend's birthday party, and knew Johnson from high school.

He told the Montgomery Advertiser: ‘It sounded like it was from just one gun.

‘There were a lot of people in the club. I heard the first couple of shots and felt the blow.’

Mr Thomas, 22, was a member of superstar
 rapper TI’s Hustle Gang and had come home to celebrate a recent hit 
song.

Ms Johnson, a Troy University student, was celebrating her 21st birthday, according to WAKA.The
 young woman was pronounced dead at the scene while Mr Thomas was rushed
 to a local hospital, police said. He was pronounced dead soon after he 
arrived.

A third 
unidentified person is in the hospital with ‘life threatening’ injuries,
 a police spokesperson told MailOnline, declining to provide further 
details.

Centennial Bar and Grill, where the 
shooting occurred, was ordered closed by Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange 
for posing an ‘imminent threat to the public's safety,’ according to a 
published statement.

This was the second such attack at the 
club in the last year. A December 2012 shooting left six injured at the 
bar, then-named Rose Supper Club, according to WNCF, and the 47th and 48th shooting in Montgomery this year.

The rapper was not performing in the bar when the shooting occurred, according to manager DJ Frank White. This was the second time he had been 
shot, the first attempt on his life resulted in the eye patch he wore 
that became part of his persona.

He had two children and a third on the way when he passed, he also had a promising rap career ahead of him.

Ms Johnson had turned 21 only this week 
and was in Montgomery celebrating during her winter break from nearby 
Troy University, in Troy, Alabama.
