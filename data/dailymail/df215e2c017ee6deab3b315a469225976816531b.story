Police are tonight investigating the death of a woman who plummeted down a flight of stairs at a Christmas party at a Premier League stadium hotel.

The 22-year-old woman had been celebrating Christmas at an office party held at the hotel on the same complex as the Madejski Stadium, home to Reading Football Club.

Police were called after the woman's body was discovered at the foot of a stairwell in the Millennium Madejski Hotel which backs onto the Royals' home ground in Berkshire.

She had sustained serious head injuries and although paramedics rushed to the hotel to try and save her, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her family have been told of the tragedy but police have not yet formally identified her.

Officers were today treating the woman's death as unexplained, and police would not be drawn on whether she may have fallen down the stairs, or whether there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding her fatal plunge.

A post mortem examination was due to take place today.

'The woman had been attending a Christmas party at the time of the incident,' said Detective Inspector Phil O'Neil.

'We are treating her death as unexplained and there are a number of enquiries taking place to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

'A post-mortem examination is due to take place later today. No-one has been arrested in connection with this incident.'

It was thought that the party had begun on Friday night and stretched into the early hours of Saturday morning, when the woman was discovered at the luxury hotel.

An ambulance spokesman confirmed that paramedics were called to the incident, but the woman was pronounced dead at the four star hotel. 

'We were called at 34 minutes past midnight on December 22 to attend to a female in her 20s,' she said.

'We had an ambulance, an ambulance officer and a crew on the scene.

'Sadly the patient passed away at the scene.'

Peter Krijgsman, spokesman for Millennium and Copthorne Hotels said: 'Our sympathies go out to the individual's family, friends, and colleagues.

'We are doing everything we can to help the police with their investigation at the scene and offering counselling to any staff affected.'

He said that he could not comment further in the circumstances.
