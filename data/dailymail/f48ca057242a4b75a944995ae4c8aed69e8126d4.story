Six children managed to escape a house fire that killed four adult family members on New Year's day in Florida.

The tragedy occurred around 7:45am Wednesday at the home in Jackson St, Marianna.

The victims were described as four women: two great grandmothers, a mother and her younger sister. They were aged between 40 and 90 years old.

NBC reports that the children, all aged nine and under, were awoken by fire alarms at the home and managed to escape in time.Marianna Fire Chief Nakeya Lovett told WJHG: 'These women were pillars in the community. A lot of people would pass by and blow the horn as they saw them sitting on the porch. It's just heartbreaking.'

According to Marianna Fire Department engineer Aaron Calloway, three of the women appeared to have died in their beds, while the fourth was found on the home's porch.

'My grandmother, her name is Gertrude Pete. Her mother, which is Sarah Johnson, that's my great grandmother, and then my mother's father's mother, Elise Pete, which was also in the house, and then my mom's baby sister who was also in the house, Cynthia Pete,' James Rhynes told NBC.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Lovett says it may have been an electrical fire.

'Right now we're speculating that it came from an overloaded extension cord,' said Lovett.

Shocked local residents gathered outside the home where six children escaped and four women died

As devastated family members and friends gathered outside the blackened shell of the house yesterday, they clung to their faith to try and understand the horrific loss.

'Job says, "Though he slayed me yet will I trust him.' That's what I hold on to," Rhynes said. "Just the simple words: 'Yet I will trust him, yet I will trust him, yet I will trust him." That's what we hold onto as a family no matter what it looks like on the outside we will trust God,' said Rhynes.

The Red Cross is helping the family following the tragedy.
