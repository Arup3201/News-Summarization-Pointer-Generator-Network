I hope Ashley Cole enjoys his time in Italy, he’s the best player England has had for many years, and the most misunderstood footballer this country has ever produced.

We should be proud of this guy, but instead too many judge him on peripheral nonsense rather than his talent and success. Judge him on his football, not his marriage, a training-ground prank gone wrong, or a broken promise at Arsenal.

Let’s start with the story that turned Arsenal fans, and many others, against him: Cole swerving his car when he found out he was being offered £55k a week. If you took a dislike to him because of this, turn the situation on yourself.

Happy man: Ashley Cole takes a selfie with the Roma shirt after being presented to the media

Italian job: Cole has landed in Rome ahead of his move to Serie A side Roma

New start: The former England defender was a free agent after leaving Chelsea

Imagine you’re earning £25k a year. All your colleagues doing the same job are on at least three times more, some picking up quadruple your wage. You’re on such a relatively low wage because this is your first job.

You ask for an increase, you’re told you’ll get a rise of £10k a year. You don’t settle for that. So you ask for more, to bring you closer, but still behind, some of your colleagues. You’re promised the new salary you ask for - £60k a year.

You accept, despite colleagues saying you’re worth far more, and despite other companies offering more.

But when the offer is put on paper, it’s actually £55k a year.

How would you feel?

Replace the word ‘year’ with ‘week’ and you have Cole’s reasons for being angry with Arsenal Football Club.

Breaking through: Cole made his Arsenal debut in the late 1990s and played more than 150 times for the club

Dream come true: Cole was pictured with the First Division trophy as a youngster and then played for Arsenal

Part of the team: Cole played alongside the likes of Robert Pires and Kolo Toure

It wasn’t the amount of money that made him nearly crash his car, it was what he perceived as a broken promise from employers he trusted.

You would all feel annoyed if your employer broke a promise to you, so it’s hypocritical to judge Cole on this.

He’s been judged on the break-up of his marriage to Cheryl.

Maybe he did wrong, and it wouldn’t surprise me if he had regrets but in the heat of a relationship, who knows what is said and done behind closed doors? Do you have all the details of their break-up? Do you know the whole truth? In the middle of a failing relationship people can say and do some awful things that they quickly regret. You’re very lucky if you’ve not been in that place.

In the public eye: Cole's marriage to Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy was popular with newspapers

Failed romance: Cole and Cheryl started dating in 2004 and were married in 2006 but divorced in 2010

Cole shot a work experience kid at the training-ground. Who can defend that? He was an idiot. But he isn’t a gangster. People over-reacted to a bit of stupidity.

Here’s what Cole should be judged on: he has won literally everything in the game at a club level.

He was an England international at 21, and won more than 100 caps. He was brilliant for his country, one of the very few of his generation who can hold his head up high and say he was excellent at international level.

Starting out: Cole made his England debut back in 2001, against Albania in a World Cup qualifier

Class apart: Cole is the best player England have produced since Bobby Moore

Landmark: Cole made it to 100 caps, captained the team and eventually ended his career on 107

And who wasn’t impressed with Cole when after captaining England last summer, he described it as a ‘dream come true.’ He went on to say: ‘I’ve lived a little boy’s dream today.’

That’s the kind of commitment and emotion I want to see from players. Cole’s got the quality and ability to back it up.

Unfortunately too many fans preferred to overlook the footballing talents of Cole, instead they chose to misinterpret and blow out of proportion stories away from the pitch. Lesser characters would have been ruined by such criticism. Cole continued to be brilliant.

Strength of character, passion for playing, quality and consistency are all his hallmarks.

Blue day: Jose Mourinho signed Cole for Chelsea in 2006

The trophy years: Cole won nine trophies in his time at Chelsea, including the Champions League

Time to say goodbye: Cole applauds the Chelsea fans after his final game away at Cardiff

But he also had the ability to compete with and be better than the very best the world could throw at him – look at the battles he won against Cristiano Ronaldo. How many England players in the past can genuinely make that boast?

He may not be a goalscorer or a fantasy-player, he may not be in an eye-catching, headline-making position on the field, but for consistency, quality, and being as good for his country as he was for his club, Cole is the best England have produced since Bobby Moore.

Do you remember him having a bad game for his country? Me neither. Arsenal can feel proud they produced him, Chelsea can feel proud they continued that development and success, and English football should be proud of Ashley Cole.
