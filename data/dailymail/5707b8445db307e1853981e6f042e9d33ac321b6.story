Police looking for missing GP Elizabeth Kinston, 37, pictured with daughter Elise, have found a body on scrubland in Nottingham

The body of a GP who went missing while suffering postnatal depression has been found, police believe.

Dr Elizabeth Kinston, 37, who was suffering from worry and anxiety after the birth of her second daughter, ten-month-old Elise, went missing two weeks ago.

A huge public appeal was launched to try to find the missing mother of two after she failed to return to her home in Beeston, Nottingham.

But on Thursday afternoon police searching for Dr Kinston found a woman’s body on scrubland about five miles from her home.

Her husband David was said yesterday to be ‘beyond heartbroken’.

Only two days ago he spoke of his belief that his wife, who was known as Lizzie, was still alive.

The couple had been due to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary tomorrow.

Detective Inspector Kev Broadhead said: ‘Formal identification has yet to be confirmed, but at this stage we do believe we have found Elizabeth.

‘It’s a tragic conclusion to the inquiry and one we were all desperately  hoping we would not have to face.

‘I would like to thank the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who helped in the search for Elizabeth, whether by sharing appeals on social media, distributing posters or getting out on the streets to search.’

Flowers were left at King's Meadow Nature reserve in Nottingham today after a woman's body was found there. While no formal identification has been made, the body is believed to be that of Dr Kinston

A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman 
said that a postmortem examination took place yesterday morning. The 
results are not expected for several weeks but her death is not being 
treated as suspicious.

As 
well as Elise, Dr Kinston had another daughter, three-year-old Sophia. 
She failed to return home on November 1. That morning she was captured 
on CCTV walking past a pub near Nottingham railway station.

Members
of the public also saw her in her Audi at a petrol station and at a car
park in Nottingham. But her car was found in the car park the next day,
with her purse and phone still inside.

Dr Kinston worked as a GP at a medical centre in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, but had been on maternity leave since Elise’s birth.

Dr Kinston has been suffering from post-natal depression and saw her own GP about anxiety on 1 November

The body discovered by police was found near King’s Meadow Nature Reserve in Nottingham.

Mr
Kinston, 36, a civil engineer, did not want to speak yesterday, but a 
neighbour outside the family’s home said: ‘He will be beyond 
heartbroken. He has lost his soulmate in the most tragic of 
circumstances.’

Previously 
Mr Kinston had said: ‘She went to the doctor’s because she wasn’t 
sleeping and was anxious. We’d had a discussion, not just myself and 
her, the family as well, and we thought she should go and seek advice.’

He also described how his wife, a devoted mother, had been tearful as 
she said a final goodbye to her family on the day she disappeared.

A 
Facebook page originally set up to help the search for Dr Kinston turned
into a touching online memorial yesterday as it was flooded with 
tributes.

Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic)

Feeling 'low' after having a baby, 
also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, 
but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and 
long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

It
usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on 
gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite
severe.

Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future.

Many of those who 
suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND 
is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less 
severe.

Treatments for PND 
include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be
very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered 
for short-term use.

Some 
women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, 
and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.

Practical and 
emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a 
great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other 
parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and 
anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an 
antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness
provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering 
from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 
Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.

Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.
