Greece's new left-wing prime minister has declared war on the country’s all-inclusive resorts, which are visited by thousands of British families every year.

All-you-can-eat buffets and unlimited drinks by the pool are under threat even though that sector of tourism brings in £1.5billion a year for the Greek economy.

Alexis Tsipras, leader of the triumphant anti-austerity party Syriza, believes such deals ‘alienate tourists from the local economy’ by keeping them in resorts and away from small businesses.

He has promised to curb the type of mass tourism that Greece has developed in the last few decades.

Deals to sell public land to mega-resort developers could be banned and VAT rules are likely to be changed to hit existing holiday developments with higher taxes.

Mr Tsipras said: ‘We do not want to continue the current saturated model of intensive exploitation of tourism.’

The new regime says it does not support an outright ban, but wants to encourage a move away from the all-inclusive resorts back to the traditional holiday model where visitors use local bars, restaurants and attractions.

Michalis Kritsotakis, the Syriza MP responsible for the party’s tourism policy, told The New York Times: ‘For the all-inclusive, our view, as well as that of the tourism industry, is that it’s not the best thing.’

There are hundreds of all-inclusive hotels on the Greek islands and on the mainland in resorts such as Agios Nikolaos in Crete and Kardamena in Kos.

They are popular with families on a budget who know that once they have paid, they will not face extra bills for meals, drinks and entertainment.

But they are a disaster for local traders and restaurant owners because holidaymakers tend to stay behind the fences of the resorts.

British tour operators have long-standing contracts with all-inclusive resorts, meaning any changes to the tax regime in Greece would be unlikely to affect visitors this year.

Thomas Cook said: ‘The change in government has no impact on our operations in Greece. As a tour operator, we are there to support our customers, who can be confident they can book their holidays to Greece with us without any concern.’

Tourist chiefs in both Britain and Greece oppose any tax changes that will put up the cost of visiting the country’s resorts.

Heads together: New PM Alexis Tsipras, left, with his new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis

By JASON GROVES, DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR FOR THE DAILY MAIL

A Marxist economist who has described austerity as ‘fiscal waterboarding’ was last night appointed as Greece’s finance minister.

Yanis Varoufakis has branded the EU a ‘fundamentally anti-democratic, irrational cartel that has put Europe’s peoples on a path to misanthropy, conflict and permanent recession’.

His appointment by far-left prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be seen as a signal that the new government will not back down over its demands to slash the country’s crippling debt repayments. 

Mr Varoufakis, an academic who has held teaching positions in Britain, says repayment of Greece’s £185billion international bailout should be linked to growth.

In practice, this would mean nothing is repaid until the economy recovers.

The left-wing Syriza party won a shock general election victory on Sunday after pledging to renegotiate the bailout deal and write off more than of half the debt. Mr Tsipras has formed a coalition with the anti-austerity party Independent Greeks.

EU leaders have reacted with alarm to Syriza’s victory, with Germany warning Greece it must pay its debts.

David Cameron warned the result would ‘increase economic uncertainty across Europe’. Vincenzo Scarpetta, of the think-tank Open Europe, said of Syriza: ‘Proving that their theories can be applied to the current political and economic reality will be a tough test.’

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras believes such all-inclusive deals 'alienate tourists from the local economy' by keeping them behind resort gates and away from businesses and attractions

The Association of British Travel Agents said this would drive holidaymakers to other Mediterranean countries.

A spokesman said: ‘The Greek government will have to consider the impact of any restrictions.

‘All-inclusive holidays continue to grow in popularity, particularly amongst the family market. The Greeks should consider that they might risk losing this slice of the holiday market to other countries such as Turkey and Egypt.

'Even though all-inclusives can be seen as a controversial option, there are pros and cons and many all-inclusives are a vital source of employment for local people, both directly and indirectly.’

Any changes made by the new Government will not affect the cost of package holidays that are currently being advertised by British tour operators as the contracts and prices have already been agreed. 

'Suicide': Andreas Andreadis, the president of the Greek Tourism Confederation, said that increasing taxes on accommodation at places like SENTIDO Port Royal Villas & Spa in Rhodes would be like ‘committing suicide’ for Greece

Aquis Arina Sand in Crete is a popular location for holiday-makers, but will it still be affordable if taxes are increased

Andreas Andreadis, the president of the Greek Tourism Confederation, said that increasing taxes on tourist accommodation would be like ‘committing suicide’ for Greece.

Last year, all-inclusive deals accounted for about £1.5billion of the Greek travel industry’s projected £12billion in revenue.

The Greek National Tourism Organisation said tour operators were hoping the new government acts responsibly.

UK director Christina Kalogera said: ‘Everyone is acutely aware of the important role tourism plays in the Greek economy and all Greek governments have always approached tourism policies with respect, which is what we expect the new Government to do once it has formed.’

Danai Badogianni, a spokesman for the new government, said: ‘The new minister for tourism will be announced today and he or she will explain our plans for all-inclusive package holidays in the coming days.’

He prefers motorbikes to limousines, refuses to ever wear a tie and lives in a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas of Greece.

Incoming Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is regarded as a true man of the people, a world away from Greece's political elite which has been characterised by corruption.

With the help of his youthful good looks and down-to-earth nature (he happily takes out the rubbish), he has swept to power on a promise to smash the EU's grip on the country's finances.

Breaking the stereotype of Greek politics, Mr Tsipras is known for his relaxed attitude: travelling around Athens on motorbikes and preferring open-necked shirts to a suit and tie.

He lives with his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, with their two boys - Phoebus and Orpheus - in an apartment block in Kypseli, a modest, working-class area of Athens.

Their youngest son's middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of Mr Tsipras's idols. 

Tsipras had never been that interested in politics, instead throwing his energy into sport at a young age until he was sidelined with a knee injury.

By his side: Ms Batziana convinced Mr Tsipras to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 after they had met three years earlier at high school in Athens

But after meeting Ms Batziana, something of a firebrand student, in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens, she convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990. 

After training as an engineer, he eventually went into politics full-time.

He was a member of the youth wing of the Greek Communist Party, the KKE, rising to prominence as candidate for the mayor of Athens in 2006. 

Tsipras became leader of Syriza in 2008 at the age of 34 at the height of Greece's economic crisis.

Syriza was formed in 2004 as a coalition of moderate Communists, Trotskyists, ecologists and other leftist groups, but has occasionally found it difficult to present a united front.

He has also become the undisputed star of the radical European left, standing against Jean-Claude Juncker in May's election for European Commission president.  

A year later, the pair found themselves at the centre of student protests against unpopular education reforms.

Tsipras spearheaded sit-in demonstrations at their school that saw students living and sleeping in the building for weeks.

Ms Batzianas was right by his side then - and still is now - with many seeing her as the driving force behind her partner's leadership.  

According to friends from the University of Patras, where she graduated in electrical engineering, she is strong-willed, militant and dynamic.  

She once hauled one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis, it was reported by the Greek Reporter.

She also hates spending hours shopping, doesn't like going for regular trips to the hairdressers and won't spend money on clothes.
