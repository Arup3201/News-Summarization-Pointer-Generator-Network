Forecasters said wind and rain will continue to batter the country until Tuesday at the earliest, as fears grew that the Somerset Levels could be flooded again

Heavy rain caused massive tailbacks yesterday as a pothole opened up across three lanes of the M25. 

The 16-foot crater created delays of up to three hours, affecting more than 130,000 motorists.

Before the lane was closed, dozens of cars were left with shredded tyres. Others missed flights at nearby Gatwick due to the gridlock.

It is thought the crater was initially caused by overnight works at junction nine in Surrey. 

Concrete intended to fill the hole failed to set overnight, due to heavy downpours. 

Yesterday also saw lengthy delays on the M3, M6 and M50.

Meanwhile, residents on the Somerset Levels were warned that the River Tone and River Parrett were centimetres away from bursting their banks.

Officials finished dredging a stretch of the rivers less than a fortnight ago, at a cost of £6million, to prevent a repeat of the devastating floods there in January and February. 

The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings across the UK.

Drivers in the North East, Yorkshire, East Midlands and the East were warned of dense, heavy fog that could ‘linger well in to the morning’.

There will be no immediate respite, with showers forecast for Sunday and another wet day expected on Monday.
