Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying. 

The extremists  have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days and force those remaining back into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

Turkish and U.S. officials last week said that ISIS was on the verge of taking Kobane from its heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders after seizing strategic points deep inside the town.

But as the tempo of coalition air strikes increased  over the past few days, amid claims the warplanes were coordinating the raids with Kurdish fighters on the ground, ISIS's advances dramatically slowed. 

The militants were eventually forced to flee from almost all of their locations in the south and west of the city, including the strategic Tal Shair hill, as well as abandoning a number of key buildings and neighbourhoods in the east.

Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobane cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders, something Turkey - which lies just 200 yards to the city's north - has so far refused to allow. 

The news comes as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and 'a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement'.

'The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,' he added.

As many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria, it was reported on Wednesday night.

Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure is higher.

Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.

But despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. 

Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said death reports were rising but it remain hard to verify.

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on Kobane a month ago. Meanwhile more than 160,000 people have fled the mainly Kurdish town.

Yesterday the U.S. State Department revealed that one of its officials has held direct talks with a Syrian Kurdish group involved in the fight against ISIS. It is the first time such talks have taken place. 

Earlier a Kurdish spokesmen said their forces had been providing American warplanes with the precise coordinates of the militants' positions in and around Kobane. 

ISIS has been keen to take Kobane to consolidate its position in northern Syria after seizing vast swathes of territory both there and in Iraq. A defeat in Kobane would be a major setback for ISIS. 

Heavy and light weapons fire were audible from across the border in Turkey yesterday afternoon, with one stray mortar hitting Turkish soil close to abandoned tents. 

Turkish security forces moved civilians and media away from hills overlooking Kobane as the fighting raged.

Six air strikes hit eastern Kobane and there was fierce fighting between Kurdish and Islamist fighters overnight on Wednesday, but neither side made significant gains, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Kurdish fighters later managed to seize a street in Kobane that had been held by militants, it added.

A journalist inside Kobane said air strikes had allowed Kurdish forces to go on the offensive for the first time since Islamic State launched their assault four weeks ago.

'We walked past some (YPG) positions in the east yesterday that were held by IS only two days ago,' Abdulrahman Gok said.

'Officials here say the air strikes are sufficient but ground action is needed to wipe out IS. YPG is perfectly capable of doing that, but more weapons are needed,' he said, referring to the acronym for the Kurdish People's Protection Units.

Islamic State militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government.

The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court.

One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq.

News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground.

The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury.

The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory.

The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants.

The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.

ISIS' Kobane offensive is one of several it has conducted after a series of lightning advances since June, which have sent shockwaves through the region and sparked alarm in the West.

U.S. officials have ruled out sending troops to tackle the group, but Kurdish forces have been identified as viable partners for the coalition, and Kurds in Iraq have received western arms shipments to bolster their cause. 

No weapons or ammunition have reached Kobane, however, fighters there say.

Islamic State terrorists last night released another propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, who warns of an impending third war in the Gulf.

In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist, who describes himself as the 'British citizen abandoned by my government', accuses the western media of being complicit with America and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against ISIS.

He said: 'Obama is terribly busy insisting US ground troops won’t be going back into Iraq. Thus even the Pentagon admits airstrikes are a stop-gap military measure that will not disrupt the Islamic State actvities' 

Captive: A still from the newly-released video of British Hostage John Cantlie. The photojournalist has been a captive of ISIS for two years

He added: 'Meanwhile, America puts 1,200 troops into Baghdad to protect their embassy and the airport. Surely sounds like boots on ground to me… The rise of the Islamic State give Obama a chance to look tough in the media just as midterm elections approach.'

In tonight’s professionally-produced video, the 43-year-old captive from Surrey – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said Obama's use of the plight of the Yazidi minority, which has suffered greatly at the hands of ISIS, as justification of military force is disingenuous.

He said: 'Since when has America cared about the fate of a minority in the Muslim lands?

'Modern history is sadly littered with religious minorities being crushed and neither the U.S.  nor anyone else said anything.'

Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who was kidnapped in Syria two years ago, also said the public is wrong to support the airstrikes.
