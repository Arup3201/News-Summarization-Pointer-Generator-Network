England were held to a draw in their penultimate World Cup warm-up game in Miami as Wayne Rooney and Rickie Lambert both got their names on the score-sheet.

Roy Hodgson made 10 changes to the team that beat Peru on Friday, so who performed and who should be looking over their shoulder? ROB DRAPER gives his ratings.

Strike partnership? England's Rickie Lambert (left) and Wayne Rooney both scored against Ecuador

Ben Foster: 6 - No hoper

Two dashes from his line, one unnecessary, one enforced did not settle nerves. But solid thereafter. 

James Milner: 5 - No hoper in this position

At fault for first goal, frequently bettered by Jefferson Montero. Much better going forward.

Phil Jones: 6 - No hoper

Doesn’t convince but this was an improvement on previous performances at centre half.

Water boy: Fraser Forster (right) made two unnecessary dashes and Joe hart is still England's No 1

Chris Smalling: 5.5 - No hoper

Lost his man for the goal, failed to cut out long balls but a saving block to cut out Enner Valenica.

Luke Shaw: 7 - No hoper (for now)

First start for England and looked good against Antonio Valencia, Ecuador captain and main threat. Great speed going forward.

Frank Lampard: 7 - No hoper

Provided stability and poise as Ecuador had long spells of first half possession – but here as back up.

Marauding: Luke Shaw got forward from left back at every opportunity

Jack Wilshere: 6 - Possible

Wants to be everywhere; ends up being nowhere important. Improved in second half, as team did. Will doubtless get some game time.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain: 7.5 - Possible

Lost possession for goal but a great threat going forward. Did all he good to win a place. On brink of starting 11.

Ross Barkley: 7 - Possible

Great nutmeg and run for England’s second. Excites going forward but loses possession too frequently in dangerous areas. Most likely an impact sub. 

Out muscled: Ross Barkley is knocked off the ball by Ecuador's skipper Antonio Valencia

Wayne Rooney: 8 - Definite

England’s biggest threat in the first half, looking considerably sharper than Friday night.

Rickie Lambert: 7 - Possible

Saw very little of the ball first half; got his reward with a fine 52nd minute goal in the second and an improved performance - but here as back up.

John Stones (for Luke Shaw 74): 6 - No hoper

Another one for the future. A solid 15 minute and a second England cap.

Jon Flanagan (for Oxlade Chamberlain 63): 6 - No hoper

Dependable when he came on to make England debut. Great experience and encouraging performance.

Raheem Sterling (for Rooney 65): 5 - Possible (much to learn)

Premier League refs might have waved it on; but in international football, diving in often brings a red car, whether you get the ball or not.

(Welbeck for Lambert 84; Henderson for Barkley 84; Lallana for Wilshere 87)

You're off: Raheem Sterling and Antonio Valencia were both sent off after they clashed

Positives from good shape and energy of the second half - until subs disrupted game. Less so with the defensive stability of his reserve back four and holes in midfield in first half - 6.5

Poor start: England boss Roy Hodgson reacts after seeing his team go a goal down inside 10 minutes

Maximo Banguera 6; Juan Carlos Paredes 6, Jorge Guagua 6.5, Frickson Erazo 6.5, Walter Ayovi 7; Antonio Valencia 7, Carlos Gruezo 7.5, Christian Noboa 6.5 (Edison Mendez 50 6), Jefferson Montero 8 (Arroyo 67 7.5); Felipe Caicedo 7.5 (Joao Rojas 45 6), Enner Valencia 5.5 

Good shape in midfield and great on the break. Less sure at the back but an encouraging performance for Ecuador - 7

Big call to make on red cards - but sliding in on tackles is a FIFA no-no. As is retaliation. Friendly or not, rules are rules - 6.5

Familiar faces: Antonio Valencia keeps the ball away from his Manchester United team-mate
