Barack Obama has come perilously close to endorsing the fast-growing Occupy Wall Street protests.

The President today said those holding sit-ins and rallies in New York and across the U.S. are expressing the frustrations of Americans over Wall Street practices and economic inequality.

The protests have slowly grown in size 
and attention over the last three weeks and now President Obama said he 
understands the public's concerns about how the nation's financial 
system works.

‘It expresses the frustrations that the 
American people feel that we had the biggest financial crisis since the 
Great Depression - huge collateral damage all throughout the country,’ 
he said.

‘And yet you're still seeing some of the
 same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack 
down on abusive practices that got us into this problem in the first 
place.’

Around 5,000 protesters marched 
yesterday in Manhattan, joined by union leaders who say they will 
continue to support the protests with manpower and donations of goods 
and services.

President Obama said the U.S. needs a strong and effective financial sector for the economy to grow, and that the financial regulation bill he championed ensures tougher oversight of the financial industry.

He launched an onslaught against banks on Thursday over rising fees and efforts to block financial reform, tapping into public anger to garner support for his 2012 re-election campaign.

‘I think people are frustrated and the protesters are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works,’ Mr Obama said.

‘It can't be competing on the basis of hidden fees, deceptive practices or, you know, derivative cocktails that nobody understands and that exposed the entire economy to enormous risks.’

During his White House news conference 
today, President Obama continued a sales pitch for his $447 billion jobs
 package, saying it was necessary to avoid another recession.

But Republicans say the proposal - a mix of stimulus spending and tax cuts for workers and small businesses plus an end to some tax breaks for corporations and the rich - will never pass as a whole.

President Obama added that he is 'comfortable' with the millionaire's surtax being debated in the Senate as one of the ways to pay for his plan to create jobs.

'In order to deal with the jobs bill, we're still going to have to reform the tax code to make sure that we're closing loopholes,' he said.

The protesters have varied causes and no apparent demands, but have spoken largely about unemployment and economic inequality, reserving most of their criticism for Wall Street.

‘We are the 99 per cent,’ they chant, contrasting themselves with America’s wealthiest one per cent.

‘The great thing about Occupy Wall Street is that they have brought the focus of the entire country on the middle class majority,’ said George Aldro, 62, a member of United Auto Workers.

‘We're in it together, and we're in it for the long haul,’ he said during a march in Manhattan.

Ed Figueroa, a janitor in a public school in the Bronx, New York, and part of the Service Employees International Union, said the march was ‘the first time in these weeks that unions have shown their face.’

‘But it won't be the last time,’ he added.

The unions were donating food, blankets and office space to the protesters, said Dan Cantor, head of the Working Families Party.

But he said the young protesters would continue to head their own efforts. The movement lacks an identified leader and decisions are made during group meetings.

‘They're giving more to us than we're giving to them,’ Mr Cantor said. ‘They're a shot in the arm to everybody.’

'We are here to support this movement 
against Wall Street's greed. We support the idea that the 
rich should pay their fair share'

Victor Rivera, a vice president for the 1199 Service Employees International Union for health care workers, said the union had donated ‘all the food they need for this entire week’ to the protesters.

‘We are here to support this movement against Wall Street's greed,’ he said. ‘We support the idea that the rich should pay their fair share.’

Late on Wednesday, some demonstrators marched toward the New York Stock Exchange but were stopped by police about two blocks away.

Police said 23 arrests were made - mostly for disorderly conduct. One person was arrested for assaulting an officer, who police said was pushed off his scooter.

Videos show demonstrators clashing with police, screaming expletives and swelling toward uniformed officers, trying to break a police line.

Police spokesman Paul Browne said the 
line charged at officers after they were told not to do so. ‘Those 
officers have a right to defend themselves,’ he said. No injuries were 
reported.

the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and 
give to those who want to protest'

Another officer used pepper spray under similar circumstances, Mr Browne said. According to the patrol guide, officers are allowed to use such instruments in order to defend themselves.

The Occupy Wall Street protests started on September 17 with a few dozen demonstrators who tried to pitch tents in front of the New York Stock Exchange.

Since then, hundreds have set up camp nearby in Zuccotti Park and have become increasingly organized, lining up medical aid and legal help and printing their own newspaper.

On Saturday, about 700 people were arrested and given disorderly conduct summonses for spilling into the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge, despite warnings from police.

A group of those arrested filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying officers lured them into a trap before arresting them. Video shows officers using bullhorns to try and tell the group to get off the road.

Several Democratic lawmakers have expressed support for the protesters, but some Republican presidential candidates have rebuked them.

‘They're basically saying that somehow the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and give to those who want to protest,’ the former pizza-company executive said.

‘That's not the way America was built,’ he added, at a book signing in St. Petersburg, Florida. On Tuesday, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney called the protest ‘class warfare’.

Activists have been showing solidarity with the movement in many cities, including Los Angeles in California, Boston in Massachusetts, Seattle in Washington and Providence in Rhode Island.

Many protesters are college students. Hundreds walked out of classes in New York, some in a show of solidarity for the Wall Street movement - but many more concerned with worries closer to home.
