Caught: State Rep. Dane Eagle, 30, R-Cape Coral, in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested for DUI after he pulled out of a Taco Bell about two miles from the state Capitol

A member of the Florida Legislature was arrested in Tallahassee on a drunken driving charge after an officer spotted him driving erratically outside a Taco Bell.

Republican Rep. Dane Eagle, 30, was taken into custody  shortly before 2am Monday after he pulled out of the Taco Bell on West Tennessee Street about two miles from the state Capitol, Tallahassee police officer David Keller said in his arrest report.

Keller says he watched as Eagle, of Cape Coral, tried to make a left turn from the parking lot and almost struck a concrete median in his path.

According to the officer’s report, Mr Eagle then stopped at a red light but went across the stripe in the street. He then made a U-turn and almost hit the curb.

Mr Eagle then drove 45mph in a 35mph zone, struck a curb and ran a red light before he was stopped, police said.

Keller says he smelled alcohol on Eagle's breath and his eyes were bloodshot, but the state representative denied drinking.

He says that when he asked Eagle to walk back to his patrol car, he stumbled and fell against his SUV.

Officer Keller stated in his arrest report that when he asked Eagle about the alcohol smell, the lawmaker again denied drinking and said it came from friends who were in the car earlier.

Keller says Eagle refused to take a field sobriety test and said he was ‘good to get home.’

The
 30-year-old legislator was taken into police custody and later refused 
to take a breath test. He was released after being charged with driving 
under the influence.

According to the arrest report, Eagle denied drinking that night and told the arresting officer that he was 'good to get home'

In
 a statement released Tuesday, Eagle said that ‘while there are some 
decisions that I would have made differently,’ he does not think 
Keller's report ‘is a complete and accurate picture of the events.’

He said that he could not explain further on the advice of his attorney, but would at a later time.

Eagle, a real estate broker, was elected to the House in 2012 after serving as an aide to former Governor Charlie Crist.

Eagle, once described as a rising star of Florida's GOP, sponsored a bill last month requiring all elected and appointed public officers to undergo mandatory drug testing, Christian Today reported.

‘We need to be as elected officials held to a higher standard,’ Eagle told WCTV in March.

Eagle's proposed legislation came on the heels of Rep. Trey Radel's arrest on cocaine possession charges. 

Radel, a Republican representing Fort Myers, resigned in January after pleading guilty to a single drug count, Naples News reported.

On Monday afternoon, Eagle appeared on the House floor to cast a vote in favor of a memorial calling for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.

House Speaker Will Weatherford issued a statement in response to Eagle’s arrest, calling it an ‘unfortunate situation.’

Tallahassee.com reported that Eagle’s father, a major contributor to Republican campaigns in Florida, pleaded guilty last year to a slew of fraud charges.
