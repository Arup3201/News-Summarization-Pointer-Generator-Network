She shot to fame thanks to the now infamous sex tape she made with ex-boyfriend Ray J in 2007.

And it could be that Kim Kardashian has more in common with her current beau Kanye West than she initially thought, as it has been claimed the rapper has starred in his very own intimate video. 

Being shopped: Kanye West has reportedly starred in his own sex tape 
with a Kim Kardashian lookalike, allegedly pictured here in a grab from the video

The nearly 20-minute-long recording is believed to have been shot with an unidentified female who is a 'dead ringer' for Kim herself, RadarOnline.com reports.

Sex tape: Kanye West allegedly filmed an intimate video with an unidentified woman shortly before he started dating Kim Kardashian

Filmed in what appears to be a hotel 
room, the married woman reportedly confirms at the start of the tape 
that she's over the age of 18 and fully consenting.

She adds: 'My husband and I don't have sex anymore... that's why I'm here!'

According to the US gossip site, the mystery woman is a Kim lookalike with a curvaceous figure and long dark hair.

Radar maintains to have seen the steamy 
tape in full and claim they can verify 'without a doubt' that it is the 35-year-old
rapper in the video.

Throughout the romp, the pair allegedly don't kiss or interact in any way apart from trying out various positions.

The man who appears to be Kanye is said to be aware he is being 
filmed because he not only set up the camera, but also looks directly 
into the device at the end of the video.

According to an industry insider, the 
tape was shot shortly before Kanye officially got together with Kim in 
March, and he is said to be 'terrified' about the video being leaked.

A source claimed to Radar: 'The sex tape is being shopped right now and there's a lot of interest, but Kanye is freaking out!

'He
doesn't want this tape out and will do anything to make sure it stays 
private. If this were to hit the market it would be worth a fortune… 
there would definitely be a lot of people wanting to see this!

'Kanye was practically in tears when he heard the tape was being shopped.'

Lookalike: The mystery woman involved in the alleged tape is reportedly a 'dead ringer' for Kanye's current girlfriend Kim Kardashian

Ironically, Kanye raps about Kim's 2007 sex tape in his new song Clique.

He states: 'Eat breakfast at Gucci/My girl a superstar all from a home movie.'

MailOnline is awaiting comment from Kanye's representative.
