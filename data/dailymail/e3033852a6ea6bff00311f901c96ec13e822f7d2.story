This is the moment a French artist decided to improve his cheap hatchback - by transforming it into a Ferrari Testarossa made out of cardboard.

Benedetto Bufalino turned his pint-sized Aixam City into his own replica of the iconic 1980s sports car as part of his latest art project. 

However, he decided against using metal to recreate the Ferrari's sleek bodywork - instead opting for flattened cardboard boxes.

His completed work is a detailed - albeit, less roadworthy - replica of the Italian supercar, which went into production in 1984.

The red creation, which fits over the Aixam City like a tea cosy, features black stripes, wing mirrors and a rear spoiler - as well Ferrari's famous logo.

It is likely to have cost Mr Bufalino a lot less to make than its $200,000 (£126,000) real-life version.

However, unlike the Testarossa's 
4.9-litre, 390bhp engine - giving it a top speed of 180mph - the imitation motor is capable of just 45mph.

Mr Bufalino, who posted a video of his cardboard creation on YouTube, has not mentioned if the car is road legal, nor whether it can withstand all weather conditions.

Nonetheless, the unusual contraption has been turning heads in the east-central city of Lyon in France.

However, not everyone has taken to the bizarre replica - with some YouTube users commenting on its lack of safety features.

Mr Buffalino, who is known for his wacky artwork, once transformed a police car into a chicken hut.
