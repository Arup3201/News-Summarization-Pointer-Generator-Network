Diego Costa has apologised for his part in knocking Chelsea out of the Champions League when he was playing for Atletico Madrid.

The Blues were sent crashing out in the semi-finals by Costa and Co courtesy of a 3-1 reversal at Stamford Bridge.

The Brazil-born Spain international has since switched sides in a £30million move to the Premier League, but is keen to make amends with the Blues faithful.

'Now I can say I'm really sorry for the part I played in the game we won at Stamford Bridge,' he said in the London Evening Standard.

New boy: Diego Costa has apologised to Chelsea fans after knocking the club out of the Champions League last season while at Atletico Madrid

On the spot: Costa scored a penalty as Atletico won 3-1 at Stamford Bridge last season

'I remember the atmosphere and the passion of the supporters. They stayed right until the end, getting behind their team, even though it was unlikely they could win after we scored two quick goals. I liked that.

'I hope my actions on the pitch and my feet will do the talking and then people can decide if I'm a good player or not, if I'm improving or not. All I can say is I love playing hard and fairly.

'Joining was an easy decision for me. We have some of the best players in the world, the best manager in the world and it's a club with great history.

'I want to improve, not only as a player but as an individual, and I believe this is the perfect place for me to do that. That's the reason I chose Chelsea and why I want to defend this shirt.'

Costa will be introduced to the Stamford Bridge crowd as a Chelsea player for the first time on Tuesday night ahead of the final pre-season friendly with Real Sociedad.
