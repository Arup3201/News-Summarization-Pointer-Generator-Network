Six teenagers who launched a violent and frenzied attack on passengers on a tram have walked free from court.

A judge said that the youths acted 'like a pack of dogs' when they cornered their victims, three young Afghan men, and beat them with sticks, poles, and socks filled with ballast in what was a mistaken revenge attack.

But despite the teenagers all pleading guilty to violent disorder after the attack, which was captured on the tram's CCTV, they were spared jail at Croydon Crown Court this week.

The court heard that before the attack, the group had chased a number of men into a petrol station in New Addington, Croydon, and assaulted one of them before fleeing as police arrived.

While the officers tended to the victim inside the petrol station, the group - armed with sticks and poles - turned on three other men, wrongly believing them to have attacked their friend earlier, chasing them as they tried to escape onto a Croydon-bound tram at King Henry's Drive tram stop.

As the victims boarded the tram, one 
of the group pulled the emergency door release, preventing the tram from
 leaving the stop and causing all the doors to stay open, according to a British Transport Police statement.

Over a ten-minute period, the statement said, the tram was
 repeatedly bombarded with ballast thrown by the 20-strong group, 
smashing several windows and damaging the tram, while one ran 
aboard and threw ballast at the victims.

It said that the group then surged onto the tram 
and began a violent and frenzied assault on the three victims, kicking 
and punching them and striking them with sticks and socks filled with 
ballast.

A spokesman for British Transport Police said : 'The group swarmed in and out of the 
tram, taking turns to attack the victims. One of the victims was kicked 
so hard against an internal, glass door that it smashed.

'Hearing that police officers were on their way, the group fled after around two minutes, discarding their weapons as they fled.'

The victims, a 19-year-old man from 
Thornton Heath, an 18-year-old man from Streatham and a third 
unidentified man, were given first aid by officers at 
the scene.

CCTV footage of the group was 
circulated on police intelligence systems and they were arrested
 after local officers recognised them.

On Monday seven of the group, all of them from New Addington, were sentenced for their part in the attack, which took place in October 2011, after earlier guilty pleas.

The court heard how they attacked the men because they wrongly believed they had earlier attacked their friend.

The attackers ran off when they heard police were coming but local officers recognised them from CCTV footage

The youths caused £3,500 of damage to the tram in the ten-minute attack with sticks, poles, and socks filled with ballast

Judge Shani Barnes said: 'I am not exaggerating when I say that your behaviour on that night was like a pack of dogs'.

Detective Constable Ostin Elkins, from
 British Transport Police, said: 'This was a callous, brutal and 
ultimately cowardly attack and we welcome the sentences handed down.

'The
 victims stood absolutely no chance of defending themselves against a 
pack of individuals who repeatedly took turns to attack, regain their 
energy and then attack again.

'This
 was also terrifying for the numerous other passengers aboard the tram, 
who were present throughout the entire ordeal, while the tram itself 
sustained over £3,400 worth of damage and had to be taken out of 
service.

'Fortunately attacks of this nature – in terms of the violence and sheer numbers involved – are very rare on the rail network.'

Kieran Hawker, 18, was given a 13-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, an 18-month supervision order, and 100 hours unpaid work.

Robert Elsey, 19, was
 sentenced to a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, an 
18-month supervision order, and 36 hours at attendance centre.

Aaron Henery, 18, of Milne Park East, was
 given an 18-month rehabilitation order, an 18-month supervision order, 
and a specified activity requirement.

Dean Riley, 19, of Cator Crescent, was 
ordered to serve a 6-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, a 
12-month supervision order, and to attend offender rehabilitation as 
directed by probation.

A seventh member of their gang, 27-year-old Anthony Patton, of no fixed abode, was 
given a 12-month custodial sentence to run concurrently with a four-year
 sentence he is already serving for an unrelated offence.

Two 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were given youth rehabilitation orders, supervision orders, and 100 hours of unpaid work each.
