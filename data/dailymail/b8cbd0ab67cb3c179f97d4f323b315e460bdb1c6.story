It has been long admired that cats can always land on their feet but this one feline has the added benefit of an extra six toes to keep her steady.

Natasha, the ginger tabby, was a stray on the streets of New York before she was adopted at the age of nine by Shirley Belwood and the pair emigrated to Wimborne in Dorset ten years ago. 

The cat has a rare condition which left her with oversized paws and 24 toes - six more than the average feline.

But Natasha, who is now 19 and spent a year looking after herself on the Upper West Side, has seven toes on both front paws - two more than normal - and five on her hind paws instead of four.

Ms Belwood, who has two other cats, said the extra digits has made her clumsier than most cats.  

'If you give her certain toys, she can't play with them properly,' she said. 'It's so funny, she looks so awkward because she just can't grab them.

'I heard her crying for ages outside my apartment window in New York and I just had to find her. 

'She's got a lot of attitude and she's quite the character but we're so close. She doesn't do as much these days as she has diabetes, but she's still so frisky and cranky - a typical New Yorker.

'The nurses at the vets say she "swears a lot" at them whenever she goes. That just shows what she's like.'

Ms Belwood added that she gets on with her other two cats but Natasha prefers a quieter life.

'She does like to keep herself to herself, she's an older lady now and likes peace and quiet,' she said.

The world record for the cat with the most toes is currently held by a Canadian cat named Tiger who has an impressive 27.

Some polydactyl cats have problems with joint growth, the forming of legs and nail beds and extra thick claws fusing together.

They are sometimes referred to as 'Hemingway cats' because author Ernest Hemingway became a famous fan of them after being given a six-toed cat by a ship's captain.

Cats born with more than the average number of toes have the congenital physical anomaly known as polydactyl - a dominant genetic trait.

The word is Greek in origin, with 'poly' meaning 'many' and 'daktylos' meaning 'digits'. 

Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw but polydactyl cats can have as many as eight digits on their front and hind paws.

The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the east coast of North America and in South West England, Wales and Kingston-upon-Hull. 

Polydactyl cats were popular with Nobel Prize-winning writer Ernest Hemingway, who collected more than 50 after he was given his first cat named Snowball by a ship's captain. 

After his death in 1961 his Florida home was turned into a museum and home for his cats. It is because of his love of the animal that they are fondly referred to as 'Hemingway Cats'.

They are also referred to as 'mitten cats' because the extra digits on their front paws can make it seem as though they are wearing mittens. 

Polydactylism is a condition that can also affect humans and dogs.
