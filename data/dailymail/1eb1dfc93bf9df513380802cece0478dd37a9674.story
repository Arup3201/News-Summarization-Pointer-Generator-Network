Europe was facing the prospect of a devastating financial crisis last night, as Greece teetered on the brink of a chaotic exit from the single currency.

Stock markets across Europe plunged after the mighty Bundesbank warned that it would be better to let Greece leave the euro than give its crippled economy any more cash.

At an emergency summit in Brussels last night, David Cameron pleaded with dithering European leaders to end the ‘fudge’ over the euro crisis.

The Prime Minister told an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels there was no point discussing plans to kickstart economic growth unless they acted ‘decisively’ to shore up the ailing single currency.

In a separate blow it emerged that all eurozone countries have been ordered to draw up contingency plans for a Greek exit.

The Bundesbank warnings sparked panic on stock markets, with £35billion wiped off the FTSE 100. Italy’s stock market fell 3.7 per cent, while Spain’s dropped 3.2 per cent.

The euro also fell to a two-year low against the dollar.

Behind closed doors in Brussels, Mr Cameron warned fellow EU leaders that ‘contagion’ from a Greek exit could destabilise the European economy for years.

‘We need a plan to deal with contagion,’ he said.

But Mr Cameron’s words appeared to have gone unheeded last night as German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted that Germany was preparing to cut Greece loose unless it agrees to stick to the tough terms of last year’s bailout deal.

Last night’s summit dinner broke up without any clear agreement on Greece. The six-hour session was dominated by discussions on economic growth, with less than an hour dedicated to the Greek crisis.

France insisted on pushing ahead with controversial proposals for a tax on financial transactions, which experts warn will hit the City of London. Mr Cameron described the proposal as a ‘bad idea’ and pledged to ‘fight it all the way’.

After the talks, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said he wanted Greece ‘to remain in the euro area’.

He said: ‘We had an in-depth discussion on the latest developments in the euro area  during which we also reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard its financial stability and integrity.’

Earlier in the evening Mrs Merkel rejected calls  for the introduction of so-called Eurobonds to ease the debt crisis.

The German Chancellor said the idea, which would effectively see Germany underwrite the eurozone’s vast debts, was illegal under EU law and was ‘not a contribution to stimulating growth’.

Her stance is a major blow to France’s new socialist President Francois Hollande who had insisted that Eurobonds were on the agenda of last night’s summit.

But it is also a snub to Mr Cameron, who had earlier told MPs that the German stance was ‘changing to an extent’.

The Prime Minister said Eurobonds ‘must’ be part of the solution, and suggested that ‘large fiscal transfers’ to struggling eurozone countries would also be needed.

Speaking in the Commons he appealed to EU leaders to act now. He said: ‘I don’t believe we can afford to allow this issue to be endlessly fudged or put off.’

But he warned it was becoming ‘ever more urgent’  to draw up contingency plans for a possible Greek exit,  adding: ‘Frankly, it’s not in our power about whether Greece will decide to stay in the  eurozone or out of the eurozone, we have to prepare for every eventuality however  difficult that might be.’

Spain cannot continue much longer with its current high borrowing rates, its prime minister warned today as he urged a joint European response to keep the region's debt problems from getting worse.

Mariano Rajoy and newly elected French President Francois Hollande also stressed their commitment to keeping Greece in the euro despite its political uncertainty.

He said: 'Europe has to come up with an answer. It is a must, because we cannot go on like this for a long time, with large differences when it comes to financing ourselves.

'And it is because of these differences that the policies that we Europeans believe in, such as controlling government spending and reforms to encourage growth, ultimately have no effect.'

'So I am going to talk about liquidity, financing and debt sustainability. For me it is the most important thing today. There are a lot of important things but this is the most urgent one.'

Earlier the Bundesbank sparked market panic by suggesting the fallout from a Greek exit would be ‘considerable but manageable’.

Germany’s powerful central bank said allowing Greece to backslide on agreed austerity measures would ‘damage confidence’ in other weakened eurozone states and could ‘call into question’ the future of the entire single currency.

The Bundesbank described the situation in Greece as ‘extremely worrying’. But it said Greece would have to ‘bear the consequences’ if it reneged on the terms of the bail-out deal. And the former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos added to the grim backdrop by suggesting Athens was also making preparations to leave the euro.

He said: ‘The risk of Greece leaving the euro is real and it depends effectively on whether the Greek people will support the continued implementation of the economic programme.’

In the Commons yesterday Mr Cameron insisted he was a ‘genuine eurosceptic’. He told MPs: ‘I’ve always been a genuine eurosceptic, sceptical about the euro, that’s why I didn’t want to join it, but we have to recognise what is now in this country’s interests, which is for the eurozone to sort out its difficulties.’

In a speech in Berlin today Mr Clegg is expected to expose Coalition tensions over the issue, by taking a swipe at those on the Tory benches who are urging Greece to quit the euro.
