Harry Kane lived every boy's childhood dream tonight by scoring on debut for England with just his third touch of the ball.

Substituted into the game at the 71st minute, the London-born 21-year-old marked one of the most remarkable debuts in modern English football with a goal scored 80 seconds after taking the field.

He also wrote his name into the record books - it was the third fastest goal scored by an England debutant behind John Cock in 1919 and Bill Nicholson, who netted after just 19 seconds on his England debut against Portugal in 1951 to set the record.

It is just the latest step in a Roy of the Rovers-style meteoric rise for the youngster, who hadn't figured in Tottenham's first team plans regularly until the start of the season.

Born in Chingford, London, Kane was playing for Ridgeway Rovers in east London - the same youth side David Beckham and Andros Townsend played for - when he was scouted by Gunners spies and joined the club as an eight-year-old.

He spent a year in the red half of north London before returning to his amateur childhood side after Arsenal let him leave.

From Ridgeway, he joined Watford's youth set up where he spent two months before being snapped up by Tottenham as an 11-year-old.

From there he had loan spells of varying success at clubs that include Millwall and Leicester.

Former club mates, family and coaches have spoken of him as 'grounded', 'level headed' and a 'good natured' person who gives his best day-in day-out on the training pitch.

Former Spurs manager David Pleat told the BBC: 'His feet are firmly on the ground. He is a very sensible boy, a modest, humble boy.'

And former England striker Clive Allen said he was a 'fine young man' when he worked with him as a 16-year-old.

'You could see from the day he walked in he had a real desire to improve himself as a footballer and the one thing I'd say about him, which unfortunately you don't say about a lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game.'

Last month Kane was pictured in Marbella, Spain, treating his childhood sweetheart Katie Goodland to a romantic Valentine's Day meal.

Harry Kane's reaction on social media revealed his delight with his performance. He wrote: 'Wow, words can't describe that feeling' and he described it as the best night of his life

And Kane's girlfriend wrote on Twitter that she was 'buzzing' and 'no-one deserves it more'

The pair, who have been dating for three years, dined at La Sala, which is part-owned by former Spurs team-mate and good friend David Bentley, and stayed two nights at the 5-star Puente Romano Hotel.

Following tonight’s game, Kane told ITV: 'It's the start I dreamed of, it's a little bit of a blur at the minute.

'It's the best moment by far, to represent your country at senior level is the top.

'Hopefully I can keep doing it and it's the first of many.'

Captain Wayne Rooney, who had scored England's opener, added: 'It's fantastic, international football's different and to score after 80 seconds is incredible for Harry.

'We're all delighted and hopefully it's the first of many.'

Last night Harry Kane wrote his name into the record books - his goal was the third fastest goal scored by an England debutant behind John Cock in 1919 and Bill Nicholson, who netted after just 19 seconds on his England debut against Portugal in 1951 to set the record.
