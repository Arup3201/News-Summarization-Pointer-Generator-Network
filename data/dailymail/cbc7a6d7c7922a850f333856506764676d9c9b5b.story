Roberto Mancini believes Mario Balotelli's stint at Liverpool is 'his last chance' to prove himself at a big club - and the striker knows it.

The Italian striker has struggled to make an impact at Anfield since his £16million move from AC Milan in the summer, scoring just one goal in a red shirt so far.

Mancini, who worked with the volatile striker at Inter Milan and Manchester City, is hoping Balotelli can start taking his chances in the Premier League.

Mancini said: 'Mario is a good guy, but he is aware that Liverpool is probably his final opportunity to prove what he can do on the pitch. It's his last chance. 

The fiery pair were famously pictured grappling during a training ground bust-up in 2013, but Mancini revealed that he is still in contact with Balotelli, who knows he 'must score more goals' at Liverpool. 

'I often talk to him via text message, but only he can help himself now.

'He told me that he wants to and must score more goals for Liverpool.'

Balotelli was more serene on the training ground with Liverpool reserves on Thursday and showed off his new, personalised snood. 

The maverick Italian's garment features the face of computer game character Super Mario and has Balotelli's squad number, No 45, on it.
