A controversial politician who responds to 'hate mail' with profanities has defended his fiery responses, telling Daily Mail Australia he should not have to quietly cop 'obnoxious' abuse.

Senator David Leyonhjelm has recently fired back at email correspondents who 'get under his skin', saying one read: 'DILLIGAF' - an acronym which stands for 'Do I Look Like I Give A F***'.

It wasn't the first missive containing cursing - in January Mr Leyonhjelm replied to an activist's email referencing Hitler with the response: 'Go f*** yourself you communist turd.'

'If you're polite to me, I'll be polite to you,' said Liberal Democratic Party senator in an interview with Daily Mail Australia.

Outspoken: Senator David Leyonhjelm often fires back at email correspondents who are 'obnoxious' to him

The Senator has caused a stir with his views about guns and animal rights in the past year, causing him to receive extensive amounts of hate mail

'There's a small group of people out there who think it's their duty to be obnoxious to politicians. 

'Some get quite astonished when this politician bites back at them. 

'Somehow there's this perception I should just cop it. 

'I don't mind people disagreeing with me. I have no problem with that at all. 

'It's part and parcel of the job. They can disagree as enthusiastically as they want. 

'What I don't have to accept is obnoxious abuse'.

The libertarian senator's swearing provoked one email writer  to start a change.org petition questioning the professionalism of his responses.

'This man is a liberal senator not a child - he's a servant of the state - yet this is how he privately talks to his constituents,' wrote animal rights activist Shane Briant, who said he received a sweary email.

But the senator said that while he rarely responds with profanities and deletes most 'hate mail', he does not have to report to a major party and can be himself. 

'The vast majority of people who send me an email are polite and get a polite response. It doesn't really matter if (I) disagree with them.' 

'Very occasionally, very rarely, something is thoroughly obnoxious and it gets under my skin.  

Senator Leyonhjelm said that former cricketer Glenn McGrath should 'be proud of your contribution to the conservation of African wildlife'

Recent tweets: Senator Leyonhjelm has been outspoken in defence of McGrath

'I don't have a party hierarchy to worry about. I don't care what Tony Abbott thinks or Bill Shorten thinks. I can be myself.' 

The NSW senator was elected at the 2013 Federal election and has stirred debate with his pro-gun position (he believes more Australians should be armed for self defence purposes) and same sex marriage (which he is in favour of).

Mr Leyonhjelm said he had received hate mail about both issues. He has stirred controversy more recently with remarks about greyhound live baiting and cricketer Glenn McGrath.

Discussing the greyhound scandal with the ABC, he said: 'I think (stopping) cruelty is the argument. We're not interested in shutting down businesses and industries

After pictures emerged of the famous cricketer standing of a dead elephant on a South African hunting trip at the weekend, Mr Leyonhjelm took to Twitter.

'Glenn McGrath - be proud of your contribution to conservation of African wildlife. Trophy hunting saves species.'

And the emails have come streaming in.
