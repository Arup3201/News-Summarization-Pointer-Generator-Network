These horrendous images show the puffed and swollen face of a woman who was the alleged victim of a cosmetic surgery nightmare.

Raluca Crisan, 38, claims to have been injected with snake venom by a Romanian doctor when all she wanted was a Botox jab.  

The lawyer says she went to see plastic surgeon Adrian Oancea, 47, and he allegedly recommended she have the anti-ageing injections.

The lawyer used to be attractive and fresh-faced (left) until the nightmare effect of the injections (right)

Hoping to regain her youthful looks, she had the jabs below her eyes and in her lips. 

But within seconds of the treatment she felt her face burning and swelling and she was admitted to hospital in the town of Alba-Iulia in central Romania after her face froze up, caused by the injections of what she claims was viper venom.

Ms Crisan said: 'My face was paralyzed for about eight months to one year. 

'My lacrimal glands [the ones that make tears] were paralyzed and I had to permanently use pharmaceutical drops. 

Ms Crisan accuses plastic surgeon Adrian Oancea, 47, of injecting her with snake venom

'I could not use any facial muscles: I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry. It was terrible.'

Images taken of Ms Crusan after the injections show her pale face frozen in a permanent pout, the horrifying look completed by blotchy skin and massive swollen bags under her eyes.  

After two years of intensive medical treatment, Ms Crisan can still only manage to use about 70 percent of her facial muscles.

Snake venom is slowly replacing Botox in popularity as a way of reducing wrinkles, but it is supposed to be put into a cream in minute quantities and then smeared on the surface of the skin and not injected pure into the skin itself.

Devastated Ms Crisan is hoping police will prosecute Mr Oancea.

She said: 'The ministry of health told my lawyer that the substance was not authorised for use here in the country and as it wasn't registered they couldn't tell me what it was either. 

'On the website of the Chinese provider however I found out that it was viper venom.' 

Surgeon Oancea has suspended his activity at the Alba County Hospital.

Nicoleta Cosarca, manager of the Alba County Hospital, said: 'In August 2014 he sent a request to the hospital board asking to suspend his work contract for personal reasons'. 

Police have also raided Mr Oancea's private practice, seizing samples and documents.

Ms Crisan as she is now having suffered, she claims, from up to a year of paralysis in her facial muscles

The lawyer is hoping the surgeon she blames for injecting her with snake venom will be prosecuted
