A Russian dancer has been sentenced to six years in a high-security prison for ordering an acid attack that nearly blinded the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet.

A judge announced the sentence after convicting Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29, and two co-defendants of the attack on Sergei Filin, 43, last January, which exposed poisonous rivalries over roles, money and power at one of Russia's most prominent cultural institutions.

Yuri Zarutsky, who admitted to being the masked attacker who threw acid in Filin's face in January, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Andrei Lipatov, who drove Zarutsky to the scene, was sentenced to four years.

Guilty: Russian dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko was sentenced to six years in a high-security prison on Tuesday for ordering an acid attack that nearly blinded Sergei Filin,  the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet

Verdict: Pavel Dmitrichenko is escorted to a court room earlier today. Dmitrichenko smiled and looked over at his father as the judge finished reading out the verdict

Judge Yelena Maximova said Dmitrichenko and two co-defendants had intentionally caused grievous bodily harm.

'Their guilt in committing the crime has been established in full,' she said.

Handcuffed
in a courtroom cage with Zarutsky and Lipatov, Dmitrichenko smiled and 
looked over at his father as Maximova finished reading out the verdict, 
which took three hours, and announced the sentences.

Lawyers for all three defendants said they would appeal.

Trail: Yury Zarutsky (centre) arrives for a the court hearing in Moscow today. Zarutsky, who has admitted guilt, has said that throwing acid in Filin's face was his own idea and he had not told Dmitrichenko of his plan

Attack: Dmitrichenko has acknowledged he wanted Filin roughed up and had given co-defendant Yuri Zarutsky the go-ahead to hit him, but said he had not wanted acid to be used

Filin
has said he can never forgive his attackers but his lawyer, Natalya 
Zhivotkova, indicated she was satisfied.

'Six years is a big 
punishment,' she said outside the courthouse.

The
judge also ordered the trio to pay a total of 3 million roubles 
($90,200) in moral damages and 508,000 roubles ($15,300) in material 
damages, as requested by Filin.

Prosecutors had asked for nine years for Dmitrichenko, 10 for Zarutsky and six for Lipatov.

The
attack left Filin, 43, writhing in pain in the snow as he returned to 
his apartment building from the theatre late one evening.

The judge said
Filin had grabbed Zarutsky's hand after he splashed the acid, but the 
assailant broke free and fled.

Maximova
said testimony showed that Dmitrichenko had offered Zarutsky 50,000 
roubles ($1,500) to give Filin a beating, and had tipped him off by 
telephone that Filin was on his way home.

Dmitrichenko,
who joined the Bolshoi as a teenager in 2002 and made his name playing 
villains such as the murderous tsar in the ballet 'Ivan the Terrible', 
has acknowledged he wanted Filin roughed up but said he had not expected
acid to be used.

Career over: Sergei Filin starring in Gisellle in 2000.  It remains unclear how many of his former duties Filin will resume at the Bolshoi after his formal return to the building in Moscow's centre in September

Zarutsky, who pleaded guilty, has said it was his own idea to use acid, and that he did not tell Dmitrichenko of his plan.

The
prosecution said in court that Dmitrichenko had been motivated by a 
conflict with Filin. Prominent former dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze told 
the court that Filin had denied roles to both Dmitrichenko and his 
girlfriend, a ballerina.

The case marks one of the worst crises at the Bolshoi Theatre since its foundation in 1776.

The
imposing colonnaded building housing its main stage, a stone's throw 
from Red Square and the Kremlin, only reopened last year after a long 
renovation dogged by accusations of waste and corruption.

The trial exposed a company riven by feuds and rivalries.

In
a courtroom confrontation, Filin said Dmitrichenko had spread false 
allegations that he had played favourites and had love affairs with 
ballerinas.

But defence 
witnesses portrayed Filin as an imperious hothead and Dmitrichenko as a 
champion of others in the company who feared to speak out against the 
artistic director, wary of his power to make or break careers.

The judge also pointed to testimony that said Dmitrichenko had accused Filin of favouritism in the distribution of grants.

In
an effort to end the scandals, the Russian government dismissed the 
theatre's longtime director Anatoly Iksanov in July, and the Bolshoi 
declined to renew its contract with Tsiskaridze, who had feuded with 
both Iksanov and Filin.

Filin
returned to the Bolshoi in September after months of treatment in 
Germany, but his sight remains impaired after more than 20 operations 
and he wears dark glasses to shield his eyes.
