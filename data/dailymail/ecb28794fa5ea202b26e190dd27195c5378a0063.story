A bride-to-be was found dead in a pool of her own blood with a knife sticking out of her stomach - and her fiancé has allegedly confessed to killing her.

Paimana Khanjar, a student at American River College, Sacramento, was engaged to be married to Omid Milad Hussain Khill, a 23-year-old student studying in Russia.

She flew to India on February 25 and was staying with an aunt in Jangpura, Dehli. The next day she was joined by her fiancé Mr Khill, who had been in Delhi since January 19 having hospital treatment for a stomach problem.

Brutal: Paimana Khanjar was stabbed at least 10 times. Police believe it was a passion killing after she told her fiance she wanted to call off their wedding

The couple went shopping on Saturday 
evening around 8pm at Amar Colony market, before returning to the guesthouse where Mr Khill was staying.

The couple discussed their three-year engagement, which had begun in their home country of Afghanistan.

A police officer told The Hindu that their relationship had was no better than 'cordial', adding that Ms Khanjar was unenthusiastic about their impending marriage, leaving Khill 'heartbroken'.

He said things 'took an ugly turn' when Ms Khanjar's aunt, Nuriya, consulted a religious leader who disapproved of the wedding.

Ms Khanjar told Mr Khill she didn't want to go through with it, apparently sending him into a fury.

In what is believed to have been a crime of passion, 22-year-old Ms Khanjar was brutally and fatally stabbed, when police say an enraged Mr Khill grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked his bride-to-be.

Nine of the 10 stab wounds were on the upper portion of her body and one on her leg.

Concerned that Ms Khanjar hadn’t returned to her aunt’s house, her neighbour Sonia went to the guesthouse to check on her.

There she found her lying in a pool of her own blood, a knife sticking out of her stomach. Police say she had been stabbed at least 10 times and had other injuries to suggest she had been beaten prior to her death.

The door was ajar and belongings were strewn about, indicating an earlier struggle.

Passion: Police believe Khanjar was killed because she told her fiance she didn't want to marry him anymore. They became engaged to be married three years ago in Afghanistan

Police suspect that the murder was planned. 23-year-old Mr Khill told them that he had bought the knife from a market three days before.

But when approached by the Times of India, the suspect went into a frenzy. ‘I did not plan anything,’ he screamed.

A police officer told the paper: ‘He said he would cut carrots with the knife and he did not buy the weapon for murder. He insisted that it was moment of madness.’

Mr Khill fled the scene of the killing and on Sunday, at around 9 am, he was arrested trying to board a flight to Kabul, Afghanistan.

A tribute video of photos of Ms Khanjar to the song I'll Be Missing You by Puff Daddy has been posted on YouTube.

Loss: College friends said they were shocked by Khanjar's death. She enrolled in 2008 and was hoping to start a Psychology course this year

Classmates from American River College have spoken of their sadness at the news.

'Really said. Just really sad. Feel sorry for the family, it's a life cut short' student Jennifer Peet said.

'Just knowing that something like that could happen to somebody who went to my school... It's just so sad,' added another, Megan Scheiza.

Jackie Beverly said: 'I think it's a tragedy because obviously she was broadening her horizons.'

Ms Khanjar began her studies at the college in 2008, and was on the waiting list for a psychology class this semester.

Police said her body will be returned to California where her mother and sister live.
