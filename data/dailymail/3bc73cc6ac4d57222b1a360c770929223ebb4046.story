'Risking lives': Lancashire County Council has been slammed by road safety experts after it admitted dimming its street lights to save money

A council has been slammed by MPs and furious road safety campaigners - after admitting dimming its street lights to save money.

Cash-strapped Lancashire County Council has cut a number jobs over the last year in a desperate bid to save £300m.

Now they have come up with a new covert scheme to save vital funds - by dimming their street lights at night.

Their plan has been criticised by MPs and road campaigners the AA - who claim darker streets cause car and pedestrian accidents and leave people 'vulnerable in their own communities'.

Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association (AA), said: 'New official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads are not getting better.

'In fact, on 40mph roads, they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather.

'This is the type of road where most of the fatalities, for which coroners blamed street-light switch-offs as a contributory factor, happened.'

Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle blasted the council and suggested it must find efficiency savings in other areas.

The Liberal Democrat said: 'It's not just about people feeling vulnerable in their homes, but on the streets of their own communities.

'Surely there is greater risk of robbery and burglary on darker streets.

'My argument would be that if the council was more efficient then they wouldn't need to turn lights off or dim them.

'I agree with the AA. It's far more dangerous with the lights off.'

Councillor Alyson Barnes, Labour member for Rossendale North, said the authority had to strike a 'balancing act'.

She said: 'There is going to be less light as a consequence but the council has to meet energy targets and this will mean less light pollution.

'I accept that in the circumstances some people won't feel as safe but in the main I think it balances out all those needs.

'Where there are increases of burglaries or accidents that needs to be reviewed.'

Andy resident Colin Hooper, 58, said: 'It is ridiculous to dim the lights to save money as car accidents, or burglaries, end up costing the council money in other areas.'

Teresa Caning, 72, said: 'I don't feel very safe at the moment in winter walking down the pavement as the new LED lights feel dimmer even when they are on full.

Nationally, a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed, compared with 148,000 in May 2010. 

'I would definitely not want to leave my home if they were dimmed further.

'The council are being a bunch of dimwits and surely this cannot be saving them that much money.'

A county council spokesman admitted lamps were being dimmed from time to time but that it was also carrying out a five-year maintenance cycle as part of a £10million investment in LED lamps.

The spokesman admitted some lights are even being switched off completely - but those were only on a short section of the M65 between Burnley and Colne.

He said: 'The authority has a programme to install energy saving measures to streetlights which began in 2009 by fitting LED lamps to streetlights and fitting controls which allow them to be turned down or 'dimmed'.

Warning: Councillor Alyson Barnes, Labour member for Rossendale North, said the authority must strike a 'balancing act' between safety and saving money

'Lancashire County Council is responsible for around 148,000 streetlights of which 62,000 are able to be turned.'

However, neighbouring Blackburn with Darwen Council said it was investing £9.9million over two years in LED lights and had 'no plans' to dim them.

Coun Jim Smith, environment boss at Blackburn with Darwen Council, said: 'We are currently undergoing a major refit of our street lights by introducing new energy efficient and long-lasting LED lanterns across the borough and they have been installed in many areas already.

'The new lights are equipped with dimmer switches but we have no plans to do it. The lights are different, not dimmer.

'It is a different kind of light because it is white light. It is a better quality light and it works a lot better than yellow light for things like CCTV as it allows you to see colours.

'In the future, we will actually save money.

'By getting on top of the roads and changing the lights, over a 20-year period, we will save £20million which will mean the project will pay for itself as well as give us a big saving.'

Nationally, a total of 1.36 million lights are either switched off or dimmed at night out of a total of 5.7 million in the areas surveyed, compared with 148,000 in May 2010.
