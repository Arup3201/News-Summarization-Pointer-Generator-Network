Thierry Henry will make his debut as a Sky Sports analyst on Sunday for Manchester City’s home clash with Arsenal.

Henry will be in the on-site studio at the Etihad alongside former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness to watch the champions play his former club.

The 37-year-old retired in December after a spell with New York Red Bulls. Henry signed for Sky Sports after he impressed at the World Cup in Brazil working with Match of the Day host Gary Lineker during the tournament.
