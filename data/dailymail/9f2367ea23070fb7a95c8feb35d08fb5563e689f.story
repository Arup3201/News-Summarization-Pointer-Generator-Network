Among the many lines of FIFA-approved script piled upon Ballon d’Or jurors during the months leading up to voting, one simple sentence cuts to the heart of the decision-making process.

Like a First Commandment for those blessed with the responsibility of putting three unbelievably talented footballers in the ‘right’ order, it describes the judging criteria as ‘performances for club and/or national team (particularly in important matches), fair play and general level of performance since November 30, 2013.’

No mention is made of trophies won, goals scored, assists provided, buy-out clauses activated or social medial followers acquired during the 12-month qualification period.

Manuel Neuer came third but the German redefined goalkeeping during an extraordinary 2014

Here's how his votes were cast:

1) Cristiano Ronaldo

2) Manuel Neuer

3) Lionel Messi 

If there has occasionally been something distasteful about the posturing and politicking since FIFA merged its annual awards with the traditional France Football honour back in 2010, it essentially remains an invitation to make a judgement call.

With that in mind, Cristiano Ronaldo made the best case to be considered first among equals.

Unlike last year, when many of us still felt that goals alone weren’t quite enough to edge out certain stellar rivals, his efforts in 2014 have been all about achieving excellence for himself and his team-mates.

When Real Madrid have needed him in the biggest games and sternest tests, especially en route to La Decima, he has delivered.

Not just through those trademark moments of individual brilliance, but by getting the best out of those around him; he is a mature talent at the peak of his powers.

There are times when Ronaldo looks more than unstoppable. Moments when he looks as if he’s playing a different sport from the rest.

That’s why he’s No 1. That doesn’t mean there wasn’t a case to be made against the Portuguese superstar - and for the German goalkeeper who got my second vote.

If the Ballon d’Or was purely about being the best player at the World Cup, CR7 wouldn’t have been in the top three.

Yes, he was playing for a makeweight nation. So, it could be argued, was James Rodriguez. As were all of the USA ‘stars’ who impressed in Brazil.

While Neuer excelled for a Germany team who surpassed all expectations, though, one month of summer football - however brilliant - doesn’t a season make.

It was an agonisingly tight decision, though, with the Bayern Munich goalkeeper deserving universal recognition for redefining his position, helping to inject mobility and adventure into his club and national teams.

Along with the small matter of winning the World Cup, he remains a huge part of the Bayern team who, despite last season’s scarring Champions League semi-final destruction by Ronaldo’s Real, remain untouchable domestically and hugely impressive on the European stage.

As for the third pick?

Well, Lionel Messi apparently endured a nightmare in 2014, ending the year without a trophy to his name. He still inspired Argentina to a World Cup final and stood out in a struggling Barca time.

Not bad for a quiet year. But not enough to seriously contend with his great rival.
