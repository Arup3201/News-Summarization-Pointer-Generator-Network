An American car wash is employing women to soap down and rinse cars in their bikinis.

Baywash Bikini Car Wash in Winter Park, Florida is open seven days a week and offers a variety of bikini-clad cleaning services ranging from $10 for a hand wash and dry to a $60 waxing.

Owner Steve McMahon, 47, originally came up with the idea five years ago to help raise money for his daughter's school - but it has proven so popular that he now plans to open a chain of bikini-based car washes across America.

Not everybody is impressed however - the local police force has now banned its officers making repeat visits to the car wash, where they have been taking advantage of free services.

Scantily clad: Baywash Bikini Car Wash opened in 2009,  initially as a fundraiser for the school attended by owner Mr McMahon's daughter

The name of the business is a play on the popular 1990s TV show about California lifeguards, Baywatch. Mr McMahon, 47 (right), came up with the idea five years agol

Mr McMahon first opened the controversial car wash in 2009.

 'It started as a fundraiser for my daughter's school and it just evolved from there,' he said. 

Now we have a lot of high-end cars coming through - we've done Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bentleys - we get a lot of nice cars here,' he added.

Mr McMahon trains each employee in leather maintenance, how to dry windows with minimal streaking, wax coating and proper detailing methods.

Tough work: Each employee is fully trained in leather maintenance, how to dry windows with minimal streaking, wax coating and proper detailing methods

Inside and out: There is some criticism the car wash objectifies women, but the vast majority of customers are happy with the work, Mr McMahon says

Critics have branded Baywash sexist, but the employees say they do not feel exploited

 Jacki Orlando, 24, has worked at the car wash for three years.

'I enjoy working at Baywash. It is hard work as far as labor but it's a lot of fun at the end of the day,' she said.

'Some people can potentially view Baywash as sexist - but I don't view it that way. My boyfriend and family are fine with the fact that I work here - it's just my job,' she added.

But not everyone thinks of the car wash as good, clean fun.

'When we opened up we offered free services for law enforcement because we appreciated their service,' Mr McMahon said.

'One day a female officer took a picture of sheriffs getting their cars washed - they quickly got an email from the captain saying "no more Baywash",'he added.

Rinse and repeat: Customer TJ Reed said: 'They do an awesome job at Baywash - and you also get some great eye candy as well

Despite some criticising the car wash for objectifying women, the vast majority of customers are happy with the work.

Customer TJ Reed said: 'They do an awesome job at Baywash - and you also get some great eye candy as well.

'If a young lady has to wear a bikini in 90-degree weather to make it through college or pay their bills - I don't think there's anything wrong with that.'

And business is booming at the car wash - which will be opening in multiple locations in the future.

'I have a couple locations getting ready to open up in Altima and one in Miami,' Mr McMahon.
