A UC Santa Barbara student recalled the horrifying moment she rushed to help a victim of virgin killer Elliot Rodger - and realized the dying man was her friend.

Sophomore Alysaa Hopper was first in line to the counter at the Isla Vista deli on Friday night when 22-year-old Rodger began firing indiscriminately inside.

Once the shooting stopped, Hopper rushed to help Chris Michael-Martinez, who was lying stricken at the front of the store and as she was was trying to resuscitate him, she made her shocking discovery.

'I was giving him CPR, looked down and recognized his face,' said Hopper.

'He was the first person I met at freshman orientation.'

Breaking down in tears as she recalled her harrowing story to NBC Los Angeles, Hopper described the terrifying scene inside the convenience store.

'It turned into absolute mayhem,' said 19-year-old Hopper, who can be seen ducking down in surveillance video.

'All the people who got stuck in the front were pretty much trapped right there,' Hopper said.

On Sunday, Mailonline revealed the last seconds of Chris Michael-Martinez, just before he was was  gunned down by Elliot Rodger.

Deceased: Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was shot and killed as he entered the IV Deli, in Isla Vista at 9.30pm on Friday night

The unsuspecting student happily walks towards the door of IV Deli Mart with a group of friends at 9.30pm, but just before he enters the store he is hit in his side by the first bullet.

As he tries to run, he is hit in the chest by a second fatal round. MailOnline and the owner of the IV Deli, in Isla Vista have decided not to run the footage as it is too graphic.

But we have obtained a new, unseen camera angle, showing the sheer carnage caused when Rodger starts firing indiscriminately into the popular store.

He pulls up on the street in his black BMW, leans out of the window and starts shooting.

As shots begin to fly, students run inside for safety. Others can be seen diving for cover in the back of the shop.

The male customer in the line scrambles away on his belly as a bullet whizzes just in front of him, missing by inches, smashing into a drinks cooler.

Alyssa Hooper can be seen dropping to her knees as the same bullet flies over her head. She then gets out her phone and dials 911. English major Chris is on the floor at the front of the shop at this stage.

'Retribution': Elliot Rodger posted a video to social media in which he outlined his plan for 'retribution' for being rejected by women

In the more graphic footage, Hopper, police and paramedics can be seen battling to save his life.

The first officer on the scene asks one of Chris’ stunned pals if he knows CPR. Tragically 20-year-old sophomore Chris could not be saved.

On Saturday, his heartbroken father, attorney Richard Martinez made an impassioned outburst, blaming America’s gun laws for his son’s untimely death.

'Our son Christopher and six others are dead,' Mr Martinez told reporters gathered outside Santa Barbara sheriff's station for a news conference the day after the shootings near the University of California.

'You don't think it'll happen to your child until it does.'
