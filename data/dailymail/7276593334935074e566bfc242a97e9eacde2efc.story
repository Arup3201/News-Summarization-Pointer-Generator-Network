Edinburgh Rugby are facing a fight to keep Scotland international Tim Visser, with a host of clubs pursuing the signature of the prolific winger.

Sportsmail can reveal that, although contract talks have opened with the SRU, the 27-year-old has yet to sign an extended deal.

That has alerted clubs from the Aviva Premiership, the Top 14 in France and also in the southern hemisphere to his possible availability.

Losing one of Scotland's top finishers would be a big blow to the rebuilding plans of Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons, who is believed to be keen for Visser to remain at the club.

But the question is whether the SRU will be able to match the big-money offers sure to come his way over the next few months.

Sportsmail understands the player is keen to have his future settled sooner rather than later to allow him to concentrate fully on Scotland's 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign.

Dutch-born Visser, who made history by becoming the first man to play for Scotland through the three-year residency rule, has been looking back to his best over the past few months following an injury-hit season.

His two tries in the 20-8 win over Glasgow Warriors earlier this month helped secure a vital Guinness PRO12 win for his side and the 1872 Cup - contested by the clubs on an annual basis. Visser also scored in Saturday's European Challenge Cup defeat to Lyon.

The big winger, who joined Edinburgh back in 2009 and made his Scotland debut against Fiji three years later, is a firm favourite of the fans who will be hoping that he remains at the club past the summer.

Meanwhile, Solomons will be grateful for some home comforts this week ahead of the European showdown with Bordeaux-Begles.

A 75th-minute drop goal in Lyon inflicted a first defeat in five games of Pool 4 on the capital club, who must now win Friday night's clash against the group' s other French outfit.

It was always likely to come down to the last round but defeat in Lyon has possibly denied Edinburgh the safety net of qualifying as a runner-up.

Head coach Solomons was in forgiving mood in France after watching a demanding schedule take its toll on his players and their Challenge Cup ambitions.

The day-long journey to Matmut Stadium came on the back of a trip to Galway, never the simplest of ventures, and a busy festive period that featured back-to-back derbies against Glasgow.

Solomons believes playing in Lyon proved a bridge too far for his drained players.

He said: 'The reasons we lost were relatively simple - we made too many errors and gave away too many penalties.

'Probably 18 of their 21 points came through a combination of those two issues. But you have to look at the reasons behind that as to why we were not at our best.

'That was our ninth game on the bounce. We had two massive games against Glasgow over Christmas, then were away to Connacht, that involves a flight and three-hour bus journey, and then immediately away in France.

'That has all been physically and mentally draining on the players, who were unable to peak once again. They were fatigued.'

Solomons could forgive the fatigue but not the indiscipline from his players, which proved decisive.

Visser and Dougie Fife both crossed in the opening 25 minutes to hand Edinburgh a dream start that should have paved the way for a second successive win on French soil.

But Matt Scott paid the price for his team's collective indiscretions with a yellow card which handed Lyon a route back.

Their 13-3 lead was narrowed to 13-10 when Romain Loursac touched down and Lyon found belief, capitalising on Edinburgh's growing number of handling errors despite three kicks from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne.

This was a missed opportunity but Solomons has hammered home to his players that their destiny remains in their own hands.

'We are disappointed to lose because that was a game we felt we should have won, despite being off our game,' he added.

'But one of the first things I told the players in the dressing room is that we are still top of the pool and still in control.

'We still have everything to play for next weekend and we are determined to put things right. Hopefully, we will have a big home crowd backing us - like the one we had against Glasgow.'

'It's going to be my job to make sure we recover in the right way this week and that the players are physically and mentally fresh for a big game.'
