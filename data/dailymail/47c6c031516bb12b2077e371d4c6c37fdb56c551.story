Sara Gebert has not eaten anything in two years, and that's not because she has been on some extreme diet.

The 19-year-old New Jersey girl has been diagnosed with an extremely rare disorder called Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction – a condition where the body behaves as if there is an intestinal obstruction, even though there isn't one.

Only 150 people around the world are diagnosed with CIPO every year. The disease has no known cure.

Fearless: Sara Gebert, 19, is battling a very rare disorder that has left her unable to eat or drink anything

Symptoms of the disorder include nausea, vomiting, pain, weight loss, abdominal distention and diarrhea.

It took doctors months to correctly identify Miss Gebert’s illness that was causing her to throw up as many as 60 times a day on an empty stomach.

In order to stay alive, Sara is fed overnight through an IV tube, which pumps nutrients directly into her bloodstream.

She also has to drain her stomach 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because her body is unable to contain its own digestive contents.

Over the past two years, the competitive softball pitcher has shed 30lbs and was forced to drop out of Fairleigh Dickinson University because she was often too sick to get out of bed.

The Union Township teen will have to rely on IV fluids for the rest of her life, unless she decides to undergo a series of invasive surgeries and go on medications to manage her symptoms, which are not covered by her insurance.

‘There are days where you're just like, “How am I going to do this every day for the rest of my life, I don't want to do it,"’ Gebert tells NBC Philadelphia.

In an effort to raise awareness of the little-known disease, Sara and her friends have founded an organization called Sara's Army and set up a website to raise funds for her medical treatment through the sale of wristbands.

On the website CaringBridge, Sara wrote about the onset of her incurable illness, which began in January 2013.

At first, the teen believed that she had a bad case of the stomach flu and brushed it off, but days passed and her condition did not get any better.

Her doctor initially thought that the problem was in her appendix, but it was quickly ruled out, along with a gallbladder inflammation.

A month later, Sara underwent an endoscopy but it has failed to shed light on what was ailing her, and she was only getting worse.

The girl spent months bouncing around various hospitals, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to the famed Mayo Clinic, without getting a definitive diagnosis.

Life-changing condition: Sara has lost 30lbs and was forced to drop out of college because she got too sick  

Heroic effort: With little funding set aside for CIPO research, Sara has taken it upon herself to raise awareness of the illness 

‘One time a doctor told me he was here to help me with my “pseudo problem.” That's when I get on my soapbox,’ Gebert tells NJ.com.

Finally last November, a team of gastroenterologists were able to determine that Sara has come down with a case of CIPO.

For the foreseeable future, Sara will have to rely on an IV line for all her nutritional needs, but it is not a sustainable solution because at any moment she could develop a life-threatening infection that would land her in the hospital.

One option open to her is to undergo a mutivisceral transplant, but only three clinics in the US perform this type of complicated surgery.

The 19-year-old laments the fact that some doctors treat her disorder as a fake disease, and that there are no charities dedicated to raising money toward finding a cure.

But she remains optimistic. Above all, Gebert wants to be treated like a normal teenager.

'I'd just like to be treated the same way I was before I got sick,’ she says.

Sara hopes to return to college and study biology. Before she became ill, Gebert aspired to become a doctor, and now she wants a career in medicine more than ever.
