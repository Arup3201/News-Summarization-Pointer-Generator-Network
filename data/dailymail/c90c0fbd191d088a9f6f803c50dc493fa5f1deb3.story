Kent bowler Mark Davies has been forced to retire from all forms of cricket after failing to recover from a shoulder injury.

Recent surgery means a career in professional sport is no longer an option for the 33-year-old, whose last first-class game was against Lancashire in September 2013.

Davies said: 'I'm disappointed with the situation but have to accept it. I really enjoyed my time at Kent and thank everyone for their support through some tough times.'

A shoulder operation has forced Mark Davies to end his cricketing career at the age of 33

Mark Davies showed promise as a young fast bowler but injuries limited him to just 109 first class matches

Davies took 315 first class wickets at an average of 22.42 during a career spanning 12 years. 

He moved to Kent in 2012, three years after he was called up to the England Test squad as injury cover, although he never actually made an international appearance.

Kent head coach Jimmy Adams said: 'Mark's retirement leaves a big hole in the bowling line-up and dressing room.

'It is never easy for a cricketer to give up the game he loves and Mark gave his all to get himself fit.

'On behalf of the lads, I'd like to thank Mark for his contribution to the club and wish him good luck for the future.'
