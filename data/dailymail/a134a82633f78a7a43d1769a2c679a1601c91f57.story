The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been diagnosed with pneumonia after he was forced to abandon his traditional Christmas Day sermon due to illness. 

Dr Welby travelled to Sierra Leone last week where he visited children affected by Ebola at a church-run facility. 

Lambeth Palace confirmed today that his 'heavy cold' has now been diagnosed as pneumonia.

He had earlier been given the all-clear from Ebola after his flying visit to the crisis hit region last week.  

But Lambeth Palace tweeted today: 'Just to confirm the Archbishop of Canterbury @JustinWelby has pneumonia & is resting at home. Thanks for all your prayers & good wishes.'

Sierra Leone has so far reported more than 9,000 cases of the highly contagious disease claiming the lives of almost 2,600 people.  

A spokeswoman for the Archbishop said he was in Sierra Leone for just three hours and has been fully assessed by Public Health England.

'He has been fully checked out. He was suffering for a head cold before going to Sierra Leone. He's been trying to shake it off for a couple of weeks.'

The spokeswoman stated 'categorically' that Archbishop Welby was not suffering from Ebola.  

Last week, Archbishop Welby visited a church-run centre in Tintafor Sierra Leone  for children affected by Ebola where he sang with some of the children before delivering a sermon in the capital Freetown

Dr Welby was due to give his sermon yesterday at Canterbury Cathedral, where he planned to address the centenary of the truce between British and German troops.

He wanted to remind worshippers that while the truce in 1914 provided a brief respite from the war, that the killing resumed shortly afterwards. 

Dr Welby was due to tell worshipers that the Christmas message should not be reduced to 'fictional stories' of of people 'swapping photos, shaking hands and sharing chocolate'. 

His planned sermon advised: 'At Christmas 1914, soldiers took the risk, crossed a battleline and kindled an evening of friendship and football.

'It is the moment all have picked on this year, whether in adverts or sermons.

'The truce illustrates something of the heart of Christmas, whereby God sends his Son, that vulnerable sign of peace, to a weary war-torn world.

'The problem is that the way it is told now it seems to end with a "happy ever after".

'Of course we like Christmas stories with happy endings: singing carols, swapping photos, shaking hands, sharing chocolate, but the following day the war continued with the same severity.'

'Nothing had changed; it was a one-day wonder. That is not the world in which we live, truces are rare.'

Dr Welby wanted to warn worshipers that the Christmas story should not be reduced to something 'fictional, naive and tidy'. 

He was due to say: 'Jesus came to the reality of this world to transform that reality - not to take us into some fantasy kind of "happy ever after" but to "Good News of great joy for all people"

He was due to add: 'Jesus did not come for one day. Jesus changed things for ever.' 

A Lambeth Palace spokesman said: 'The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, is suffering from a severe cold and will, with great regret, no longer be preaching the sermon at Canterbury Cathedral this morning.

'The Dean of Canterbury, the Very Rev Robert Willis, will deliver a homily.'

Earlier, Archbishop Welby said 'the deceit and cruelty of governments and rulers as not changed in the 2,000 years since King Herod'.
