The original maybe more than 50 years old, but you can once again take to the road in a brand new Ford Mustang. 

A Florida startup company called Revology is selling a clone of the first-generation car, souped up for the 21st century.

You won't be able to tell from looking at vehicle, but it comes complete with LED headlights and even remote central locking. 

The seats and windows are electric - and all disguised in the classic 1960s interior decor.

Can it be true? Florida startup Revology is selling a picture perfect clone of the first-generation Mustang

Classic: Revology starts with licensed replica bodies built by Dynacorn, filling them with a collection of curated parts intended to improve on the ride and performance of the classic while maintaining its old-school style

Welcome back: Revology Cars unveiled the new version of an old Ford Mustang on Saturday

Way back when: The cars are licensed Ford Mustangs from the original production line that ran between late 1964 and 1966, using authorized reproduction bodies and equipment

Revology founder Tom Scarpello introduced the vehicles this past weekend. They are modeled on the original muscle-cars sold between 1964 to 1966.

Numerous details ensure the new car maintains the look of the original, including power windows that are activated by pushing or pulling on the original window crank handle.

Although the bodies of the vehicles are new, some of the insides are made up of curated parts intended to improve on the ride and performance of the classic while maintaining its old-school style.

The engine is a re-manufactured 1990's-era 302 V8 supplied by Ford, which was chosen because it's the same size as the original 289 V8 and fits perfectly in the chassis without any modifications.

The engine is a fuel-injected 5.0-liter V8 producing about 265 HP. 

Of course with modem technology the ride is even smoother than the original with new suspension and power steering too.

Legend: The cars power came in from a 302-cubic inch V8 Windsor engine, a motor engine first introduced in 1962

Old favorite: The body design has been licensed by Ford , which is making this car the closest thing to buying a restored classic Mustang

Back on the market: The original Ford Mustang is a half-century old, but now you can buy a brand new one

Used car or new car? The Revology Mustang replica was unveiled to the public for the first time last weekend at the Amelia Island Concours

Fastback flashback: A fastback starts at $ 119,500.00, while a convertible with power top is listed at $122,000, with deliveries on new orders starting next year

Groovy: The car can be equipped with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic gearbox

Spot the difference: Look closely, and you’ll notice the LED head and taillights

Style: The car has power seats and windows that are operated by switches disguised as wind-up cranks

Opening up the ashtray will lead you to something of a surprise with a USB and Aux ports for the Bluetooth-equipped two-speaker AM/FM radio. There's also remote keyless entry and even air conditioning.

However, even with all of the upgrades, Revology's Mustang replica looks so authentic, it can easily be mistaken for a perfectly restored original 

Revology hopes that several of the cars can be built although it will cost considerably more than the original $2368 base price. Ford sold 1.3 million of the original Mustang model first time around.

The 1964 1/2 Mustang' fastback starts at $119,500 while a convertible with power drop-top roof will go for $122,000. 

'Our car is not just a copy,' Scarpello says in a promotional video the company produced.

'Our car is really a postmodern interpretation of that original Mustang. In other words, it is upgraded with modern technology and materials that weren't available 50 years ago.'

The company reported that the response at Saturday's car show in Florida was 'overwhelmingly positive.'

'We have about 50 people who are seriously interested in buying one of our Mustangs,' Scarpello said. 'The next step is to find a new facility and start building.' 

However some car enthusiasts say that it should be possible to recreate a Mustang by simply replacing the older parts of an original mode for closer to $38,000... but then who has the time for that?!  

The replicas should be in driveways by next spring. 

Old friend:  It's still undeniably a Mustang in shape, naturally. The brand new steel body is produced by a company called Dynacorn, but licensed by Ford, with only a few changes to integrate the modern underpinnings

Stunning: The engine is a remanufactured 1990’s-era 302 V8 supplied by Ford, which was chosen because it’s the same size as the original 289 V8 and fits perfectly in the chassis without requiring modifications

Remember your first time? The car is equipped with electronic fuel injection and the eight-cylinder engine can produce 265 horsepower and 300 foot-to-pounds torque output

Driving off the lot: Selling over a million cars in under three years, the Mustang became one of the most beloved cars made anywhere in the world, with an original base price of $2,368.
