A group of Morris dancers have been forced to end a 900-year-old procession as they struggle to cope with the magnitude of paperwork involved.

The Dolphin Morris Men revived the 12th century event, dating back to 1109, in 1981 and have carried it out every year since.

But this Saturday will be the last time they dance 20 miles from Nottingham to Southwell as organisers 'can no longer keep up with the 21st century'.

Tradition: The Dolphin Morris Men have danced across 20 miles from Nottingham to Southwell every year in a 900-year-old tradition but can no longer afford to close roads and cope with the magnitude of paperwork

End: The procession, started in 1109, cost £500 this year and took weeks to organise, co-ordinators say

To hold the procession, which snakes through pubs and village greens along the route, the committee have to apply for road closures and buy signs.

Added to the remaining costs, they have finally decided it is untenable.

Co-ordinator Chris Gigg said: 'What started as a simple procession has become very complicated. The cost associated with this year’s event has been about £500.

'Because of the procession, we have to close off some of the roads, which obviously takes a lot of planning.

'If you’re having road closures, you also have to hire road signs and things like that. The administration and costs involved in organising the event is out of all proportion.

'We’re really disappointed as it has been a fantastic tradition, with people coming together from all over the region.

'Unfortunately the 21st century has caught up with us.'

Support: The parade started as a way to raise money to support the church and build the Southwell Minster

Route: 160 Morris dancers will leave Nottingham at 8.30am this Saturday after the Lord Mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence - the amount Nottingham gave to Southwell in 1109

The Dolphin Morris Men’s Bagman Martin 
Morley, 60, said: 'I’ve really enjoyed being part of this ancient 
tradition, especially as people from all over come along to take part.

'Unfortunately, increased regulation with road closures and costs has made it very difficult, so we’ve decided to stop doing it this year.

'It’s a shame, but it has just become a bit too much for us.'

The Gate to Southwell tradition celebrated the 12th century procession of parishioners to Southwell Minster in order to pay for the upkeep of the cathedral.

As the Dolphin Morris Men’s website explains: 'It all started in 1109 when it was decided to build a 'Mother Church' at Southwell - what is now known as Southwell Minster.

'Churches don’t come cheap, so they hit 
on a ruse to invite people from all over the Diocese to walk to 
Southwell and bring money with them. The walking made it a nice day out,
 and the transport costs thus saved could be given to the church. The 
perfect plan!

Lamenting the magnitude of red tape, co-ordinator Chris Gigg said: 'The 21st century has caught up with us'

'The amount given by each parish varied, according to the wealth and generosity of the parishioners. Nottingham, for example, gave 13 shillings and four pence (about 66p), whereas lowly Stanton gave only 5d (about 2p). The whole lot came to 15 pounds, 18 shillings, seven pence and one farthing.

'In today’s money, just under £16 - the cost of a CD - but in those days, enough to buy a whole steeple, or a good sized nave.'

History books show that Morris dancers have been involved in the event from as far back as 1530.

On Saturday, more than 160 dancers will process between Nottingham and Southwell. The ceremony begins at 8.30am when Nottingham’s Lord Mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence.

Some dancers walking the entire 20 miles and others using cars or minibuses to get between the various meeting points.

It ends with a rendezvous at Southwell Minster where the purse containing the ‘Southwell Pence’ is handed over to the clerk.

Dolphin Morris Men member Bob Hine, 70, was responsible for re-starting the event 33 years ago and has been part of the procession ever since.

He said: 'I’m trying to think of it in a more positive way.

'It’s amazing we’ve kept this going as long as we have.

'It started off as a one-off event so to have carried it on for more than 30 years is fantastic.'

Peter Goode, Nottinghamshire County Council's traffic manager, said: 'It will be disappointing to see the loss of a 900 year-old tradition, but there is also a need to recognise the complexity of managing old events safely on today's roads which carry high volumes of fast-moving traffic.

'The County Council has supported this event by waiving charges for making legal orders and approving traffic management, but we do have to ensure that event organisers make their own proper arrangements to ensure the safety of participants and the general public and to minimise disruption.

'The standards for the management of traffic are set by the Department for Transport and apply across all local authority areas and to all similar events nationwide.

'We are happy to work with the event organisers and propose other routes which may reduce their costs by being less dependent on road closures, diversions and traffic restrictions.'
