A team of Indian workers has built a ten-storey tower block that rises over 100 feet into the sky - all in just two days.

More than 200 builders and three cranes worked 'around the clock' to meet the tight deadline, in a desperate bid to finish in time for tea on Saturday.

And, despite taking just 48-hours to make, its planners say it is so sturdy it will last for at least 600 years.

Gently does it: The high-rise, known as Instacon, entered into record books as the fastest completed building of its kind

Work on the building's construction 
started around 4.30pm on Thursday and, by Friday evening, the seven 
floors were already in place.

And as the deadline approached, 
workers were rushing to put the finishing touches, from glass window 
panes to interior fittings, to the build in a desperate bid to finish by
4.30pm on Saturday.

A team of more than 200 people worked in Mohali round the clock to build a building within its 48-hour deadline.

The building, called Instacon, entered into record books as the fastest completed building of its kind in India.

We did it! Workers cheer after they put the finishing touches to the building after 48 hours of work

'We
assembled the 200-tonne building, having an area of over 25,000 square 
meters within the stipulated time of 48 hours, whose deadline ended at 
4.30 pm on Saturday,' said Harpal Singh, CMD of Synergy Thrislington, a 
Mohali-based infrastructure company.

He also showed the certificate issued by the Limca Book of Records for being the fastest 10-storey building in India.

I. C. Syal, an ex-professor of Punjab Engineering College who designed the building, said the structure can last for 600 years.

'It's a tube-in-tube structure. There will be no problem of seepage or leakage.

'We also measured the building's deflection in case of strong winds and earthquakes, which comes to 49mm as against 123mm deflection allowed by the government for conventional buildings,' Syal said.

Singh added that other works, including air conditioning, lighting and making toilets functional will be taken up later.
