Fight promoter Frank Maloney shocked the world of boxing yesterday by revealing he is undergoing a sex change.

Wearing a wig, lipstick, dress and heels, the 61-year-old now lives as a woman called Kellie.

The former boxing manager, who guided Lennox Lewis to the world heavyweight title, retired in October – claiming she had fallen out of love with the sport.

 Her greatest fight: Boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who guided fighter Lennox Lewis to the peak of the sport, is now living as a woman called Kellie

One of the hardest parts of the decision was telling her second wife and Kellie insists she doesn't want a new relationship and isn't interested in a sexual relationship with anybody

But it has now emerged that Maloney walked away to begin preparing for a new life as a woman, revealing yesterday: ‘I can’t keep living in the shadows’.

Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, is now more than a year into the transition period, learning to live as a different gender.

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery.

So far the process has involved secret hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Maloney said: ‘I wasn’t born into the right body, I have always known I was a woman.

Kellie says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing.

‘Living with the burden any longer would have killed me. The feeling of wanting to be like and dress like a woman has always been there.

‘I consciously made the decision that I wouldn’t dress like a woman, but it was a constant urge.’

Maloney, who was known for wearing Union Jack suits, said it would have been impossible to tell anyone in the macho world of boxing – despite making the careers of British Commonwealth and European champions such as cruiserweight title holder David Haye.

‘Can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on? I can imagine what they would scream at me,’ she revealed.

‘But if they had been in the theatre or arts world nobody would blink an eye about this transition.’

Maloney, who had a box at Millwall football club, described how he told second wife Tracey, 47, about the transition at their home in Chislehurst, south-east London.

‘We were standing in the kitchen and I said, “I have to tell you I have lived with this all my life. I have lived a lie and I really am a female in my head”,’ she said.

‘As the words started to come out I wanted to catch them and pull them back in. I looked at her face and I knew my marriage was over.

‘I went upstairs and I broke down. She came up and I told her I was going to our house abroad.

‘I was not happy when the relationship ended. It had been a security net around me. But it was the first step of me starting life as a woman.’ Maloney insists she doesn’t want a new relationship.

Born in Peckham, South London, the former promoter has been politically active in the past. In 2004, Maloney stood as an independent during the London mayoral vote and was the Ukip candidate in Barking, East London, at the 2010 general election.

Yesterday, a number of boxers expressed their support. Former WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson said: ‘Ignorance is the problem of others, not yours.’

Former welterweight champion Ricky Hatton added: ‘He’s still a top guy, so I don’t care.’ And Lennox Lewis posted on Facebook: ‘This world we live in isn’t always cut and dried or black and white, and coming from the boxing fraternity, I can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for Kellie.’

Yesterday both Maloney and wife Tracey both declined to comment.

While many might be shocked by Frank Maloney’s transition into Kellie, it comes as no surprise to me. There’s no rule which says that hairdressers are more likely to be transgender than sporting professionals.

If anything, the opposite holds true. There is so much blame and shame about being transgender that many will do all they can to hide it – often taking up careers that exaggerate their birth gender.

So men may be more macho and women more feminine. It can make the transition more of a shock to other people, but not to those who have been through it.

For me, that was four years ago. Happily settled with my partner of seven years and two young children, I decided aged 52 that I could no longer live as a man and needed to become ‘Jane’.

Support often arrives from unexpected directions. I was working as a science and technology writer, and the atmosphere in the office was laddish. I dreaded returning to work as Jane, but I was surprised and grateful for the nonchalant way my male colleagues reacted.

One said of my painted nails ‘the colour doesn’t suit you’, while the rest just got on with work as usual. Friendships endured. Family members were supportive. My partner stood by me. And that’s how it should be.

My heart goes out to Kellie. Transition opens the door to public abuse and discrimination – but for some people changing gender is necessary, and my own experience shows it can lead to happiness.
