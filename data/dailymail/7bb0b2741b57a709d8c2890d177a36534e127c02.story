Australia's decathlon hopeful suffered an embarrassing 'schoolboy error' at the Commonwealth Games after not one but two false starts in front of 40,000 people.

Jake Stein fluffed his start on the sprinting blocks twice ahead of his 100 metre race in Glasgow on Monday.

'I just went a bit too early – twice – just school boy errors really,' Stein said.

'You learn to start when you are seven or eight and I forgot how to do it today.'

Stein blamed the second false start on a noise he thought he heard. 'The bloke on my inside was a bit loud and it could have just been him breathing. I knew straight away and punched the ground,' he said.

'I definitely knew it was me, the guys I'm competing against I don’t think they're silly enough to go twice.

'I knew it was me straight away, I could see I was well ahead of everyone and my start is not that good.

'Obviously there were a few nerves being my first senior comp, I got a bit too excited and went twice.'

The rising star's double mistake is likely to have cost him his promising chance of getting a medal.

Decathlon events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all.

The sprint race would have added valuable points to his tally and Stein has admitted that he considered ditching the competition after the error.

'For a couple of seconds I was like, 'Do I really want to be here?' And then my mind changed pretty quickly 'yes I do - this is what I have trained for for two years I wanted to get back out on the track’, being inside that stadium is ridiculous, (there are) 40,000 people for (the) decathlon,' he said.

Stein went on to compete in the Men's Decathlon Shot Put on Monday

He also took on the long jump competition despite originally wanting to quit the Games

After his fail on the track he tweeted some words of encouragement

'Decathlon is 10 events, not nine not one. I have got eight events now after the long jump, I am looking forward to those, I have got a few throws to show them how Australians compete.

'I felt decent in training. I usually compete well over the whole 10 events at major champs so I don't come here to go away without something to take from it. A medal was definitely in the plan now it is just keep ticking away get a few PBs and a few individual wins - three throws three victories that would be nice.'

After his fail on the track he tweeted: '"Tough times come and go but tough people last forever" Robert Lister.'
