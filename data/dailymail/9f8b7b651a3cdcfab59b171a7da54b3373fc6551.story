For most of her life, Hannah Christmas had been labelled mentally ill. Dogged by crippling depression and memory lapses, and at times unable to read or write properly because it felt as if her brain was ‘slowing down’, doctors told her she had a severe mood disorder.

Over more than a decade, the  35-year-old solicitor was given countless drugs to ‘cure’ her, from antidepressants and sedatives to  the mood stabiliser lithium – usually given for mania. But nothing touched the ‘unbearable fog’ that left her unable to work full-time.

For, in fact, there was a simple  but overlooked cause. Hannah has the little-known – but surprisingly prevalent – Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, an extreme form  of PMT brought on by a hormonal imbalance.

Raising awareness: Hannah Christmas, 35, from Bermondsey in South London, suffers from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, an extreme form of PMT

Unlike PMT’s more physical symptoms – headaches, bloating and abdominal, breast and back pain – PMDD causes dominant emotional symptoms as well.

Period pain  can be extreme and coupled with nausea and panic attacks. Sufferers also experience suicidal thoughts, frequent crying, anger, feelings of being out of control and trouble thinking.

Symptoms typically occur in the week before a period, then go away once it starts, and are thought to be due to an increased sensitivity to the natural changes in hormone levels.

And while PMDD affects  up to five per cent of women,  many GPs have never heard of it  – meaning that hundreds of women  are misdiagnosed with psychological disorders.

‘Women with PMDD often describe having a Jekyll and Hyde personality,’ explains Professor John Studd, a world-renowned expert on PMS.

Hidden condition: Hannah's hormonal disorder went undiagnosed for 20 years and doctors thought is was psychological, giving her drugs to treat mental illness

He set up the first-ever specialist unit at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in West London and now runs a private practice.

‘About ten days before their period starts, they have this total change of personality. It can be very destructive, particularly to personal relationships. People might tell them to pull themselves together, but they can’t.

‘I have seen so many women misdiagnosed as having psychiatric disorders. But PMDD is cyclical and once menstruation occurs, symptoms subside. This is how we know it is an endocrinological [hormonal] disorder, not psychiatric.’

Hannah’s symptoms started when she was 14. ‘My moods got worse  as the years passed,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t have a proper social life or relationship because for half of the year I couldn’t function properly.’

At university, she would hide away in bed when suicidal feelings struck, unable to face going out. Her moods ruined any chance of a relationship as the men she met couldn’t cope.

‘Some days I would just lie in bed sobbing. It was so difficult to study when the depression struck as it would take me several minutes to make sense of one paragraph,’ says Hannah, from Bermondsey in South London. ‘My cognitive function was so badly impaired.’

Struggle: Hannah's PDD symptoms started when she was 14 and got progressively worse

Hannah began suffering insomnia and night sweats in her 20s, so severe she left her job at a City law firm.

‘For two weeks of every month I’d be absolutely fine. Then for the next
 two weeks I’d descend into this mental hell.

'I had a feeling my illness
 wasn’t what the doctors thought and asked why I was well for half of 
each month. They would just shrug.’

Hannah struggled on for over 20 years, seeing a series of doctors and psychiatrists who consistently failed to diagnose the right problem.

One psychiatrist even suggested 
controversial electro-convulsive therapy, usually the last line of 
intervention for schizophrenia and catatonia.

‘It terrified me,’ Hannah recalls.

‘I really didn’t want to do it but I
 had reached the end of the road in terms of treatment so I considered 
it. I just wanted to get better.’

Then last September one of her 
colleagues suggested her symptoms might be due to hormones, and 
something clicked.

‘She told me about PMDD. I’d never heard of it but 
when I looked it up, it made sense.’

Hannah’s
 research led her to Professor Studd at The London  PMS and Menopause 
Clinic.

He has conducted extensive studies into  the effects of hormone 
therapy on PMDD, in particular the use of the female hormone oestrogen.

He
 discovered that in 94 per cent of cases, oestrogen either dramatically 
reduced symptoms or eliminated them.

It was a huge breakthrough. He also
 discovered that not only are women with PMDD intolerant of the hormone 
progesterone – previously used to treat PMT through the contraceptive 
pill – it actually makes symptoms worse.

Lack of exercise, stress and eating a poor diet also aggravate symptoms. So does delaying motherhood.

‘Anything that halts or interferes with the menstrual cycle, like pregnancy, can stop PMDD,’ explains Prof Studd. ‘But more and more women are putting off having children, which doesn’t help.

'As women get closer to menopause, levels of oestrogen drop, which means symptoms can get worse. The only answer is to have a baby or a hysterectomy. For women who want children later, the only other option is hormone treatment.’

Sadly, some of Prof Studd’s patients have been so desperate that they have sacrificed motherhood.

Thanks to Prof Studd, Hannah began hormone treatment – a combination of an oestrogen implant, and a coil which administers small doses of progesterone.

She says:  ‘At last I can reclaim my life. I have stopped taking lithium. I should never have been on it. It does make me feel angry that there are women like me being given unnecessary drugs and being told they have mental illnesses they don’t have. There needs to be a lot more awareness about this condition.’
