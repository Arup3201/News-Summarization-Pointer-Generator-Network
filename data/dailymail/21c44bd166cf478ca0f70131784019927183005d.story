Dick Advocaat has
 stepped down as Serbia coach after his side suffered a 3-1 home defeat by Denmark
 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night.

The Serbian football
 association (FSS) confirmed Advocaat's departure on Saturday.

The Dutch manager leaves his post after taking charge of the Balkan nation in July, seeing out just four months of a two-year contract.

Friday's loss to the Danes in an empty stadium left Serbia's
 qualification hopes in the balance.

They have one point from two
 games, pending UEFA's final verdict on last month's home
 qualifier against Albania, which was abandoned after crowd
 trouble.

The 67-year-old was in charge of just four matches and failed to register a single win, including draws with France and Armenia.

Advocaat previously managed Russia and Holland on the international stage, while he also spent four seasons at Scottish club Rangers between 1998 and 2002.
