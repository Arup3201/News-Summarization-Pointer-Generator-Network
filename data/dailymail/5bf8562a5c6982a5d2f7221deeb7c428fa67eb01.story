Catharine Bell has felt permanently airsick since flying to Turkey in 2005

A mother-of-two has been battling a constant feeling of travel sickness since taking a flight eight years ago.

Catharine Bell, 46, was left struggling to balance, nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in Marmaris, Turkey, in 2005.

Ms Bell, from Bellingham, Northumberland, thought the feeling would pass but was horrified when her symptoms worsened throughout the holiday until she could no longer walk down the hotel corridor without holding onto the wall.

Even after arriving back in the UK following the two week holiday with her daughters, Jessica and Annie, now aged 18 and 13, Ms Bell’s symptoms failed to subside.

She was eventually diagnosed with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS) and has suffered from incurable, and sometimes debilitating, attacks ever since.

Ms Bell said: ‘I got on the plane and I was perfectly healthy, it was a perfectly normal flight. And then when the plane landed I stood up to get my bag and I felt a bit weird.

‘As soon as we landed and I stepped off the plane I felt seriously odd. The whole world had transformed into bouncy castle land and I felt as if I was walking on a giant marshmallow.

‘Throughout the holiday that feeling never went away, it was like being on the Pirate Ship at the fairground my world was moving up and down and from side to side constantly.

‘I felt sick, had a headache and felt decidedly unwell. I presumed I had an ear infection and thought I would wait it out, go home, and see the doctor.’

However, when the family’s flight home took off all of Ms Bell’s symptoms disappeared and she thought she was better.

Unfortunately, the respite was short lived and the symptoms returned as soon as she stepped off the plane.

Ms Bell said: ‘And so started a terrible few months of doctor visits, travel sickness pills, ear syringing, lying on the floor crying, hanging onto the bed, throwing up, and nobody finding anything wrong with me.

‘I felt like my world was constantly moving, I felt nauseous all the time, I couldn't sleep because when I lay still everything would keep moving up and down, back and forth.

‘After five to six weeks I was tired, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't read because the words would jump out of the page, and I couldn't sit still because the more still I was, the worse it was.

She was left struggling to balance, nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in Marmaris

‘And then one day I woke up and it was gone. I was so relieved I thought I was cured, I really thought it was an imbalance in my ear and it had settled down.’

However, when Ms Bell went to Turkey with her daughters again the following year, her symptoms returned and this time they were worse.

When she returned she was left unable to sleep, read or walk in a straight line. At one point she could not stand up and was left clinging to the carpet in her living room as her world spun around her.

Megan Arroll from the University of 
East London, said: ‘Mal 
de Debarquement Syndrome, or the "sickness of landing", is a condition 
characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying, similar to 
those of being on a boat.

‘MdDS
is usually triggered by long-haul air and/or sea travel but there have 
been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion-based games and
fun fair rides.

‘Additional symptoms can include nausea, headaches, fatigue and sensitivity to light.

‘Our
research within the Chronic Illness Team at the University of East 
London has shown that these symptoms can last for years and impact 
significantly on individuals' lives, disrupting work, relational and 
recreational activities, which in turn can lead to depression and 
anxiety.

‘This is an 
invisible illness - the person may not look unwell.

‘It can be very difficult to gain a diagnosis as there is still much uncertainty
surrounding MdDS; we do not know the cause of the illness at present 
and it is currently a very under-researched condition.

‘There
is no 'cure' for MdDS at this time although interestingly, those with 
the condition often find symptoms temporarily diminish during motion, 
for instance car travel, which differentiates MdDS from conditions 
concerning the inner ear.’

Despite several visits to her GP, doctors were baffled by her condition.

Desperate for a diagnosis, Ms Bell turned to the internet and came across Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS).

This is a neurological disorder triggered by travel, such as boat or plane journeys.

The symptoms last long after the journey has finished.

Instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, people with MdDS feel as though they are rocking or bobbing constantly.

This feeling can last for months, or even years, and the only time this feeling subsides is when they are in motion again.

When Ms Bell read about MdDs on the internet, she took the information into her doctor who confirmed this was what she had.

However, the doctor informed her that there is no cure and so she has been forced to live with the condition ever since. 

She said: ‘When I got home from holiday I staggered to the doctors and I actually lay down on the floor in the doctors’ surgery and gripped onto the carpet, I felt so ill.

‘The doctor and another patient had to practically carry me into the surgery and onto the couch. I had to hold onto the wall because I was convinced I was going to fall off the couch.

‘None of the conventional vertigo tablets made any difference so I started to research and found MdDS online. I knew instantly this was what I had, I showed the research to my doctor and he confirmed it.

Ms has now had the symptoms every day for the last four years.

She no longer drinks alcohol as it is difficult enough to maintain her balance without a drink, she cannot dance and she finds it difficult to read.

She also cannot sit still for longer than an hour at a time.

But despite her condition, Ms Bell leads a normal life - she has two jobs as a school caretaker and a play leader, continues to go on holiday every year, and does everything she can to prevent the condition ruining her life.

She felt unwell throughout the holiday but assumed that she had an ear infection and decided just to visit a doctor when she got home

She said: ‘I've never had it as bad as the first two episodes but I've now had it constantly for almost four years.

‘I take precautions to avoid my symptoms worsening. I don't drink, I eat well, I exercise a lot, I avoid any kind of boat journey, if I fly I walk on the plane and I try not to sit still for too long.

‘At the moment I live in a wibbly wobbly world, if I stand still or sit down I can see the world swaying slightly. It makes it hard to read or watch TV and I have a constant headache and feel sick.

‘If I'm tired or I've been on a long journey, I am worse but it's usually at its worst when I'm still.

‘Walking on a treadmill is really hard, I fall over, standing still with my eyes shut is impossible, I find myself falling backwards, almost like I'm being pushed.

‘Dancing is almost impossible, anything where I have to be spun around or do a quick turn is a big no no.

The symptoms did not improve on her return to the UK and she was eventually diagnosed with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome

‘In between work I go to the gym for up to two hours a day, and walk my dog five times a day, anything to keep me moving.

‘There is no cure, there's no medical information, no treatment, there's nothing that's going to make it better - I just have to live with it.

‘I lead a very full, happy, if slightly topsy turvey life.’

Megan Arroll from the University of East London, who is conducting research into the condition, said: ‘Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, or the "sickness of landing", is a condition characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying, similar to those of being on a boat.

‘MdDS is usually triggered by long-haul air and/or sea travel but there have been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion-based games and fun fair rides.

‘Additional symptoms can include nausea, headaches, fatigue and sensitivity to light.

The cause of the condition is not known and there is no cure so Ms Bell has had to learn to live with it

‘Our research within the Chronic Illness Team at the University of East London has shown that these symptoms can last for years and impact significantly on individuals' lives, disrupting work, relational and recreational activities, which in turn can lead to depression and anxiety.

‘This is an invisible illness, the person may not look unwell, and we have found that there is the additional problem of stigma and lack of social support.

‘It can also be very difficult to gain a diagnosis as there is still much uncertainty surrounding MdDS; we do not know the cause of the illness at present and it is currently a very under-researched condition.
