Andrea Barzagli has rejected recent criticism aimed at Italy coach Antonio Conte for including two foreign-born players in his squad to face Bulgaria and England.

The Juventus centre-back defended his manager, who has come under fire from Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini among others for his choice to select Eder and Franco Vazquez, who are both Brazilian-born and Argentinian-born respectively. 

Speaking in a press conference ahead of Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria, Barzagli was keen to welcome the duo to the squad.

'There have always been oriundi,' Barzagli said, using the Italian word for foreign-born players. 

'There are rules, if they can be called up it's right that they have been because that means they are doing well in the league.

'I don't see why there should be debate, other nations have them, too. If they are good, if they can give us a hand, they're welcome in the national team.' 

The 33-year-old, who has 50 caps at senior level, admitted that in the face of criticism his international boss always puts the team first.

'Conte? He's very forthright, he says what he thinks and goes his own way. It's normal that he can create controversy if he knows that certain decisions will benefit the National Team.'

However, with Euro 2016 likely to be the veteran defender's last major tournament for his country, Barzagli hopes that the likes of 20-year-old Sampdoria defender Alessio Romangoli can fill his shoes.

'I can't see myself still in Azzurro [the Italy squad] after the Euros, primarily because I'll be over 35. I'm not a player like [Gianluigi] Buffon or [Andrea] Pirlo who can keep going until 40.

'So I hope that young defenders like [Alessio] Romagnoli can take over for the National Team. There needs to be rejuvenation, definitely.'
