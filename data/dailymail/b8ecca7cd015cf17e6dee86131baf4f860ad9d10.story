'Comfortable in my skin': Janice Atkinson says being a member of UKIP allows her to speak her mind on the issues that matter to her

She is one of Britain's most senior female politicians, a working class girl who started her own business and lauds other 'strong women' .

But now Janice Atkinson is standing up for the men - and the very ones who have been labelled 'sexist' by so many in recent weeks.

The former Tory joined UKIP after defecting from the Labour party after the last election.

And in the wake of several infamous interviews by male members of her party that many have deemed 'sexist', Mrs Atkinson - now one of UKIP's front-running candidates for next year's European elections - has said that Labour and the Tories are far more anti-women.

UKIP's treasurer Stuart Wheeler recently caused a stir when he claimed women were no good at chess, bridge or poker, while Godfrey Bloom, the MEP of the infamous 'bongo bongo land' comment and who said women were better suited to 'finding mustard in the pantry' than parking cars.

But in an interview published in The Times today, Mrs Atkinson said she would never have joined the party if it was full of misogynists.

'If you think about the political parties and the type of people that belong to them, I came across more sexism in the Tory party than I ever have done in UKIP,' she said.

In her posts on the Daily Mail RightMinds blog, she has written in support of women such as MP Louise Mensch, who resigned her position as Conservative MP for Corby last August.

Defence: Stuart Wheeler, left, and Godfrey Bloom, right, are not the ones with the 'outdated attitudes', says Janice Atkinson

Mrs Atkinson wrote of Mrs Mensch that 'Men hate her 
because she was successful and made money' and 'women feminist 
Guardianistas will tear her apart for letting down the sisterhood'.

Now Mrs Atkinson has insisted that the
'outdated attitudes' belong to the constitutional clubs in the Tory 
shires or the working men’s clubs of Labour’s northern heartlands rather
than her own progressive party.

'They’d like to go back to a 1950s Britain. We’re not going back to a 1950s Britain, we’ve got to look forward,' she said.

By contrast, she described Mr Wheeler as 'a sweetie'.

Mr
Bloom, she said, was not being sexist when he said small businesses 
should be allowed to sack female employees who fall pregnant.

'The 
point he was making is that this is all very damaging,' she said. 'If you take the 
baker’s down the road, if they employ five or six women and three or 
four of them go off on maternity leave, that’s a big problem.'

Her
only criticism of his remark was that he gave women too much credit on 
the pantry-hunting front. 'My husband’s better at it,' she laughs.

'I 
stand there in my kitchen and I can’t find the mustard.'

As for his reference to countries 
receiving UK aid as 'bongo bongo land', Mr Bloom 'does not have a racist
bone in his body', she said.

The
former Conservative candidate for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire 
where she stood as Janice Small, who was beaten to her seat by her 
Labour rival, says she has no regrets about switching over to UKIP.

The
party has time to hear her passionate views on Europe, she said, and she feels 
freer to discuss immigration, welfare and grammar schools than she did 
with the Tories.

'I feel comfortable in my skin now,' she said. 'I feel comfortable knocking on doors and talking to the issues that matter to them without being politically correct.'

The daughter of a cleaner and a coal worker, who left school at 16 and started her own business, says she is also opposed to the idea of favouring women in the boardroom.

She believes women have only themselves to blame when they don't make it to the top.

'There's this whole endemic sort of feminista thing and because they can't get there by their own means they want quotas and they want to impost that on the rest of us,' she said.

She said she would 'love' to reach the 
point where half of all companies were headed by women.

But sheattacked 
'hectoring' Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman for supporting quotas to
alter the gender balance on company boards.

'I am everything
that Harriet Harman isn’t,' she said.

She said she would 'love' to reach the point where half of all companies were headed by women, but attacked 'hectoring' Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman for supporting quotas to alter the gender balance on company boards, calling herself 'everything that Harriet Harman isn’t'.

As well as her likely ascension to the European Parliament next year, Mrs Atkinson said she has plans to fight for a marginal Tory seat in Kent.

She refused to say which one, but hinted that it is currently held by a 'token women'.
