With just over two months to go most people have not yet drawn up a Christmas list, but one town has already put up its festive lights.

But it's not because residents have an extra dose of Christmas cheer -  they are put up by volunteers who can only help out on Sundays so their preparation starts early. 

Council chiefs are reluctant to shell out for contractors so the team of seven volunteers have started the painstaking checking all the fixtures before putting them up.

Christmas come early: The lights in Coleford, Gloucestershire, take months to erect because each bulb and fitting has to be rigorously tested to meet safety regulations

Volunteers will be working every weekend
to make sure the town is ready for the big switch-on, which is set to 
take place on November 30 during the town’s Christmas festival.

Kevin Wilkins, 44, said: 'We get quite a lot of abuse from people in the community who think we start too early.

'But there are over 160 illuminations and everything has to be checked for safety.

'We are down on volunteers at the moment and if we had more we could start later.

'If some more people could come forward to help it would be great.'

Community: Generous donations from townsfolk help the Coleford Christmas Lights Committee pay for safety contracts and insurance to cover working on ladder and using cherry-picker cranes to put the lights up

Mr Wilkins has spent hundreds of hours during his 15 years as a volunteer.

The father-of-four said: 'When people moan we just say ‘Merry Christmas’.'

He said the 'smiling faces' on the big night make all the hard work and flack they take worthwhile.

Unveiling: The lights - which are paid for with funds raised by the committee and a £4,000 grant from Coleford Town Council - will be turned on on November 30 and left up until January

Early birds: The market town looks festive in mid-October

'They have six Sundays in which to put up a fantastic display, before they are switched on on the last Friday in November.'

The lights - which are paid for with funds raised by the committee and a £4,000 grant from Coleford Town Council - will be turned on on November 30 and left up until January.

Town Clerk Annie Lapington said: 'As 
the town council, we give a grant to the group so our Christmas lights 
are much more cost effective than other towns’

'They are moving to totally LED lights which are much more environmentally friendly.'
