Changes: On Friday night she went for dinner with her family, but said the steak was so rich for her that she had to share it out

Mellen spent the weekend at home with her children, Julie, 39; Jessica, 26; and Donnie, 25, and to her new grandson, Aidan, 16 months

And following last week's release the 59-year-old spent the weekend at home with her children, Julie, 39; Jessica, 26; and Donnie, 25, and to her new grandson, Aidan, 16 months, reports Yahoo.

Mellen's youngest children were seven and nine when she was arrested.

'When they handed me my grandson … it was so overwhelming and exciting just to hold him and just to know I was totally free,' she told Yahoo's Katie Couric. 

She spoke of her delight that Aidan did not cry when she held him and said she is now looking after him for her eldest daughter Julie.  

Jessica has been engaged for eight years but has waited for her mother's release until she began planning the wedding and the pair now plan to go wedding dress shopping

Donnie, 25, had a broken heart tattooed on his chest to represent his distress at his mother's imprisonment 

On Friday night she went for dinner with her family, but said the steak was so rich for her that she had to share it out.

Mellen said she found a simple joy in taking a shower: 'I haven't had my bubble bath yet. 

'I'm still waiting for my bubble bath - I haven't had a bath in 17 years. 

'I was in the shower the first night, I'm not going to lie and there was a door and I was making weird noises like a little kid "Oh my God, I am really in the shower and I am all by myself and there is a door and nobody is going to walk in and nobody is going to talk to me.'' 

Mellen was arrested in 1997 just as she was buying her youngest daughter, Jessica Besch, a Happy Meal.

'Me and her were at McDonald's when I got arrested and we didn't have a Happy Meal that day,' she said. 

'... It's a happy ending right now...We're going to have a new beginning.'

At the weekend the pair revisited the fast food outlet in a step forward to forget about the past. 

'I got my Happy Meal yesterday so I was really stoked about that,' said Jessica. 

Jessica said she and her fiancé of eight years were waiting to get married until her mother could be at the wedding.

'We're going to go dress shopping together,' she said. 

Mellen also spoke of her amusement at the new technology in the world. 

 

'Watching people walking down the streets with phones was like, wow, don't people put those phones away?' she said. 

She called her life in in prison 'frightening' and said she doubted she would make it out alive at some point as she was 'threatened and hit.' 

Mellen also spoke about Daly and said he 'did not deserve that' and the news of his death was 'devastating.' 

On Friday the courtroom burst into applause after Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold overturned the conviction. 

Mellen had entered the courtroom in tears, and her children also wept.

The judge said Mellen had inadequate representation by her attorney at trial.

'I believe that not only is Ms. Mellen not guilty, based on what I have read I believe she is innocent,' he said. 'For that reason I believe in this case the justice system failed.'

June Patti, a known drug addict , had a long history of giving false tips to law enforcement

Mellen's case was investigated by Deidre O'Connor, head of a project known as Innocence Matters that seeks to free people who are wrongly convicted.

O'Connor said in an earlier interview that she found that Mellen was convicted in 1998 of the 1997 killing based solely on the testimony of a notorious liar.

Mellen was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

The witness who claimed she heard Mellen confess was June Patti, a known drug addict who had a long history of giving false tips to law enforcement, according to documents in the case. 

Even Patti's sister, a police officer, described her as a pathological liar. 

Patti died in 2006.

Three gang members subsequently were linked to the crime, and one was convicted of the killing. 

Another took a polygraph test and said he was present at the bludgeon killing of Richard Daly, and Mellen was not there.

Daly, Mellen's ex-boyfriend, was bludgeoned to death and set on fire in an alley.. 

In a habeas corpus petition, O'Connor said the police detective who arrested Mellen was also responsible for a case in 1994 that resulted in the convictions of two men ultimately exonerated by innocence projects.

It said the primary evidence against Reggie Cole and Obie Anthony was the false testimony of an informant who avoided prosecution for other charges in exchange for his help.

'Although each member of this family suffered tremendously, they remain a close family unit,' O'Connor said.

One of the daughters was honored by Innocence Matters for bravery in obtaining a confession that helped to prove her mother's innocence, O'Connor said.

'The 'kids' are overjoyed by the news of their mother's anticipated exoneration and are anxious to make up for lost time,' O'Connor said.

Since she was found guilty, three other gang members have been linked to the murder and one passed a polygraph

Mellen's youngest child was just seven years old when she was arrested. There was no hiding the emotion of finally being cleared with that young child now a grown adult who, like all three of her children, has stayed close
