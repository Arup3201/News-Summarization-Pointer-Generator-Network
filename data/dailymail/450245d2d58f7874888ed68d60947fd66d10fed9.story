Mahatma Gandhi's last will and testament and a pair of his iconic sandals have been sold at auction along with 50 items of memorabilia.

The two-page document, signed by the Indian independence leader in his Gujarati signature, had a guide price of between £30,000 and £40,000 but sold for £55,000.

The great man's size eight sandals - which he wore in the 1920s after being given them by a friend - sold for £19,000, £9,000 more than their asking price.

Sold: A pair of Gandhi's sandals from the 1920s that were given to a friend by the great holy man sold for £19,000, £9,000 more than their asking price

Large collection: This painting of Gandhi standing with his iconic stick, measuring approx 61cm by 39 cm, is signed by the artist J L Bhandari who was probably one of Gandhiís many followers

Other lots up for sale included  a shawl, hand-woven by thread that Gandhi spun himself, and a rice bowl said to come from the house in India where Gandhi lived 
from 1917 to 1934.

But a sample of blood purportedly from the father of the Indian nation didn't draw high enough bids and failed to sell.

The item, described as a bit of Gandhi's 
blood on two glass microscope slides, was said to be provided by the leader 
when he was recovering from an operation for appendicitis in 1924.

There were also three of Gandhi’s 
delicately carved miniature figures depicting the wise monkeys; speak no
evil, hear no evil, see no evil.

Gandhi gave many of the items to a close friend in 1924 when he was living
at Palm Bun at Juhu in Maharashtra, India. The were passed down 
the friend's family over the years who then decided to sell the 
collection.

The memorabilia was offered by British auction house Mullock's in Ludlow, Shropshire.

Iconic: A shawl which was hand-woven by thread Gandhi spun himself on a charkha and frequently worn by peace activist

Pictorial maxim: Gandhi's carved three wise monkeys which depict speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil

Contrasting image: A photograph of Gandhi suited and booted was sold as part of the £250,000 archive

Auction expert Richard Westwood-Brookes said today's bidding for the blood didn't meet the £10,000 reserve price.

He said about 50 other items took in £287,000 and the auction house was 'very pleased' with the result.

A
'rare British Parliament paper declaring Gandhi a terrorist' from 1932,
which had a guide price of between £200 and £300, went for £260.

A
printed illustration showing Gandhi shaking hands with George V sold 
for £25. Other lots include Gandhi's bed linen and his prayer beads.

Gandhi - known as Mahatma Gandhi - was the leader of Indian nationalism and was famous for using non-violent civil disobedience

The items were sold alongside other important and historical documents.

However,
a version of the Declaration of Irish Independence issued during the 
1916 Easter Rising - considered to be the only copy in the world - 
failed to sell.

Last year a pair of Gandhi's glasses with a guide price of £10,000 sold for £34,000 at the racecourse.

At numerous Gandhi auctions around the world over the past decade, the Indian government has insisted it should have the right of first refusal because the artefacts are a national treasure.

Not only are the sandals part of the 
famous image of the Gandhi, along with his spectacles and loin cloth, 
but they have spawned a phrase.

‘Gandhi’s flip-flop’ entered the lexicon to describe a dry mouth the night after drinking heavily.

Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi - known as Mahatma Gandhi - was the leader of Indian 
nationalism and was famous for using non-violent civil disobedience.

He lived modestly and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha.

Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought he was too sympathetic to India’s Muslims.
