Why is everyone so tired all the time? I am one of the country’s leading holistic doctors who specialises in tiredness, and in this ground-breaking series I will show you how to conquer exhaustion by making small adjustments to your lifestyle.

In part one  I highlighted the hidden causes of feeling worn out. Here, I present the three-week energy cleanse that will help you feel refreshed . . .

CLEANSE YOUR MIND 

Takeaways, chocolate and a good night out — I like them as much as the next person and I know how hard they are to give up.

Takeaways are not only bad for weight gain, they also contribute to exhaustion

The trouble is that they contribute not only to weight gain, but also to our collective exhaustion.

But drastic lifestyle changes can’t happen overnight. So, I’ve devised a three-week cleanse that will wean you off sugar and reset your metabolic balance to help you regain vitality.

I’ve taken the best of all the many detox and weight-loss regimes I’ve tried to create the easiest plan to follow: there’s no need to hibernate or give up work and your social life.

People often presume a detox is just about what they eat, but it’s also important to cleanse your mind, use natural skin products that contain few or no chemicals and let go of negative emotions to restore your energy.

Another good reason to do a detox or cleanse programme at least twice a year is to give the digestive system a rest. It produces as much serotonin, the happy chemical, as our brain, so a sluggish gut can affect our mood, mental well-being and energy levels.

This is the way to feel less tired and more energetic, less run-down and more ready to take on the world!

DUMP PROCESSED FOODS

First, get rid of temptation. Dump all energy-zapping processed foods, potatoes, pasta, bread, cake, desserts, chocolates, crisps, junk foods, fizzy drinks, tea, coffee and milk from your house. Take them to a food bank or give them to a friend or relative.

As I explained on Saturday, processed sugar causes spikes in our body’s blood sugar. This causes a temporary surge in energy, but then causes a massive crash that leads us to feel more tired.

On the other hand, a diet rich in protein such as meat, fish and eggs excites orexin cells in our brain (a protein-like molecule that regulates mental processes from sleepiness to hunger), boosting our energy levels.

Good nutrition is how we absorb sunlight and energise our bodies. The shopping list printed on the right is full of delicious nutritious foods to help us connect with the earth and sunlight and feed our own natural source of energy. You do not have to get everything, but it is an indication for what you can eat during the plan.

Shop just once a week, as this cuts down on the temptation to buy unhealthy food.

WEEK 1 

The first week is a gentle induction to wean yourself off your old, unhealthy diet. The key is to avoid hunger, as that will make you more likely to give in to unhealthy snacks.

An omelette with some meat or vegetarian sausages is a good option for breakfast

Have a breakfast high in protein, as studies have shown this boosts your energy, helps burn fat throughout the day and keeps you feeling fuller for longer.

For lunch and dinner, divide an average-sized dinner plate into four quarters and fill it as follows: half with vegetables or salad, a quarter with protein and a quarter with carbohydrates, such as brown rice or couscous or sweet potatoes.

The two things people struggle with most is detoxifying from caffeine and sugar. If you’re struggling without coffee (withdrawal normally lasts only two to three days), have a diluted cup made with half your usual amount, and cut it down by a cup a day. Decaff for a few days is also acceptable, but it’s better to go cold turkey.

If you’re battling sugar cravings, you can take an amino acid supplement called L-glutamine, available from health shops. You can take one capsule of 500mg up to once an hour, and if taken on an empty stomach it can trick the body into thinking it has sugar in its system.

Top tips for eating out

WEEK 2

The difference this week is that there are two liquid meals a day (juice, smoothie or soup). The best fuel for your body is fruit and vegetables, and juicing them is beneficial because you can drink more than you can eat, and drinking freshly made juice gives your digestive system a rest.

Two liquid meals a day are proscribed by Dr Roked

If you juice 80g each of four different fruit or vegetables, that can count as four out of your five a day. And nutrients are absorbed easily.

I advise a liquid breakfast and dinner, and your big meal at lunch, so you have a long time for your digestive system to rest and repair overnight.

A big meal at lunchtime may seem tricky at work, but most workplaces have a microwave so you can reheat something you’ve prepared. If not, make a large salad with couscous and cold meat (for great recipe ideas, see right).

If you are new to liquid meals, you can start with one a day, for breakfast, and then by week three you can build up to the two liquid meals a day if you can manage it.

If you really feel you cannot do this, just continue to ‘eat clean’ (ie within the para-meters of the shopping list).

Keep well hydrated with herbal tea or water. Any time throughout you feel hungry and you have already drunk a glass of water, you can snack on fruit, vegetables and hummus, seeds or nuts.

The amount of carbo-hydrates is reduced this week. The other change is supplements I recommend you take:

So, your programme will look like this:

Breakfast

Snack

Nuts constitute a 'clean' snack in between meals

Lunch

Snack

Dinner

WEEK 3

By now you will feel amazing and used to the Week 2 eating plan, which you’ll continue this week.

It’s time to increase exercise and perform an ‘emotional detox’.

Your energy levels should have rocketed, so focus on goals and resolve any issues that might be causing you stress and exacerbating tiredness.

The worst thing you can do after the three week plan is splurge on foods like cheese

Reflect on what you want out of life, what you do well and haven’t done so well.

Write a plan to achieve any goals in a realistic time frame.

The more in tune you become with yourself, the greater the improvement in your health, energy and quality of life.

What to do after the THREE-WEEK CLEANSE

The worst thing you can do is go on a massive binge of chocolate, cheese and bread. Most people I know who did ended up suffering with stomach cramps.

Take things gradually. Eat two ‘clean’ meals a day (with ingredients from the shopping list), then have small amounts of wheat and dairy if you want for your third meal.

Also try to have two completely ‘clean’ days in the week. This gives your body a chance to recover from any excesses.

By this time you should be brimming with vitality and enthusiasm for your new lifestyle.

2 shallots, finely sliced

½ red chilli, sliced, seeds removed

1 tbsp olive oil

3 tsp mixed dried herbs

Preheat the oven to 180c. Roughly chop the vegetables and place in an oven tray, coat with olive or coconut oil, half of the mixed herbs and half of the crushed garlic, roast for 30 to 45 minutes, checking and turning regularly.

In a separate baking tray, coat the chicken or fish in a mix of chilli powder, the remaining garlic and mixed herbs and salt and pepper to taste.

Bake in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes for fish, or 25 to 35 minutes for chicken. Serve the chicken or fish with the roasted vegetables.

4 tbsp shredded unsweetened coconut 2 tbsp runny honey or agave nectar ¼ tsp sea salt

Blend the nuts in a food processor until crumbly. Add the dates and blend again until soft. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until you have an even brown mixture that should not be too liquidy. Spoon the mixture into a baking tray and pat down. Refrigerate for two to four hours. Then cut the brownies into squares. These can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week.
