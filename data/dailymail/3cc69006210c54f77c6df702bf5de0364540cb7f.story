The activist group, Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), is in the middle of a campaign against Wing Pointe commercial hunting grounds for its live pigeon shoots, NBC10 in Philadelphia reported.SHARK began using its remote controlled flying device equipped with a high-tech video camera to stealthily record Wing Pointe’s pigeon shoots.

The group says the drone’s camera’s video feed was destroyed and that the device went out of control before it was manually brought down.The gunshot caused around $4,000 in damage to the camera, the group says.

Sharks called Wing Pointe’s live pigeon shoots ‘not just vile and immoral, but we believe illegal,’ in a recent statement posted on its website.The group also posted an online video of a pile of dead pigeons it says was left by hunters at Wing Pointe.Prior to the drone shooting, the activist group said it plans to ask a local district attorney to hold the hunting resort legally accountable for its pigeon shoots.A Wing Pointe representative could not be reached for comment.State police said they are investigating the drone shooting.Watch video here:
