The last few days have been something of a whirlwind for Joey Prusak whose story has been all over the internet.

The Hopskins, Minnesota Dairy Queen employee saw 'an older lady' steal a $20 bill from a blind customer after unknowingly dropping it on the floor.

Joey ended up confronting the thief and asked her to return the money to its original owner.

Serving up kindness: Joey Prusak, 19, an employee at the Hopkins, Minnesota Dairy Queen (pictured) gave a blind customer $20 out of his own pocket after he saw another customer steal the man's money he dropped on the ground

Honorable: Joey Prusak, 19, said that returning the money to the blind man 'felt like it was the right thing to do'

When she refused, he ended up giving $20 back to her on behalf of Dairy Queen. It was, however, his own money.

A fellow customer witnessed the interaction and wrote an email to the store which was then printed, posted on the store noticeboard and then photographed and posted online.

Joey has simply said that he was just doing his job.

Mr Prusak started working at the Dairy Queen in Hopkins five years ago when he was just 14.

Sweet spot: The thieving customer was asked to leave and the witness said they will forever be a Dairy Queen customer after the incident (stock photo)

Nice tip: A witness emailed the company and praised the employee

'It's the only job I've had, the only 
job I've needed,' he smiled. He is now the manager of the store and 
essentially runs the branch.

The
 letter to the store explained how the customer saw a blind man had 
taken his food and sat down inside the store to eat.

Joey went 
over to him and opened his wallet, giving him $20 of his own cash saying that
 he wanted to give him the money 'on behalf of Dairy Queen' before 
promising that it had the same face value as the bill he dropped.

'I
 was in shock by the generosity that your employee had, taking his own 
money out of his own wallet to give to the customer because some other 
lady decided to steal something that wasn't hers,' the customer wrote.

He talks about the incident, which happened on September the 10th, in the most modest of manners.

'[After
 the visually imparied man gave his order] right then and there I knew 
when he dropped that $20 bill, game's over, he's not going to know,' 
explained Mr Prusak to KARE11.

'He
 just kept walking and that's when the lady picked it up and I thought, 
she's going to give it back 'cause she picked it up so quickly.'

Mr Prusak said he then saw the woman her put the money in her purse. He didn't know what to say, at least not at first.

When the customer reached the counter for her order, Joey confronted her. She claimed the money was hers and he said it wasn't.

'I
 said, ma'am I'm not going to serve someone as disrespectful as you, so 
you can either return the $20 bill and I'll serve you, or you can 
leave,' explained Prusak.  'And she goes well it's my $20 dollar bill, 
and I go, we'll then you can leave.'

Accolades: Joey received a call from Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world (and a major shareholder in Dairy Queen) and he has had offers to appear on Queen Latifah's TV show

It was one of the other customers in the store who saw what happened and wrote an email to Dairy Queen.

An impressed co-worker decided to post the message on Facebook and it ended up going viral.

He
 has been inundated with requests from various news stations and 
websites that he has lost count, however he says he is excited about a 
possible appearance on the 'Queen Latifah Show.'

'Warren Buffet called me this morning and we talked for about 10 minutes,' Mr Prusak said.

Warren
 Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, one of the richest men in the world and a
 major shareholder in Dairy Queen, personally called to say he's a big 
fan.

Mr Buffett said he’s planning future talks with Mr Prusak.

'I
 go, ‘What I would like to know is why you’re calling here?’ He goes, ‘I 
just wanted to call and thank you for all that you did. It means a lot 
to me,’' Prusak said.

'He told me he was going to have me flown out in May,  to attend an investor's conference in Texas.'

'I was too star-struck to be asking questions,' he admitted. 'I didn't even know what to say.'

Even with the star-studded attention, Joey Prusak remains humble about his deed.

'I just felt like it was the right thing to do,' he said.
