A 76-year-old man who fatally shot his unarmed teenage neighbor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, days after telling the court he killed the boy for justice because he believed he stole his shotguns.

John Henry Spooner's home had been burglarized two days before the May 2012 shooting, and he suspected 13-year-old Darius Simmons as the thief. So he confronted the teen, demanded that he return the guns and then shot him in the chest in front of his mother when he denied stealing anything.

Spooner's own home surveillance cameras captured the shooting in Milwaukee and prosecutors aired the footage in court.

Despicable: John Spooner , pictured last week, murdered a 13-year-old African-American boy and says he would have shot his brother too. Spooner was sentenced today to life in prison

A jury found Spooner guilty of 
first-degree intentional homicide last week, a conviction carrying a 
mandatory life sentence.

The judge could have allowed for the 
possibility of parole after 20 years, but rejected that option, citing 
Spooner's lack of remorse and desire to also kill the teen's brother.

Spooner, who has lung cancer and other physical ailments, will spend the rest of his life in prison.

Tragedy: Darius Simmons was gunned down after his elderly neighbor wrongfully accused him of stealing several guns from his home

While
 in court for his sentencing, Spooner spoke in a frail voice that was 
sometimes difficult to hear and reiterated that he felt he had little 
choice but to take the law into his own hands.

'They
 had to rob the house,' he said. 'Why'd they do that to me? ... They 
pushed me over the edge, I guess.

'I don't know. As far as being sorry, I
 don't know if I did right or wrong.'

Judge Jeffrey Wagner replied sternly: 'I can tell you, you did wrong. You took the life of a child.'

The
 defense had argued that the killing might have been reckless but not 
intentional, and said Spooner didn't mean for the shot to be fatal.

The
 surveillance footage showed Spooner confronting Darius on a sidewalk, 
pointing a gun at the boy's chest and firing from a few feet away. 
Darius turned and fled, and then collapsed and died in the street 
moments later as his mother cradled him in her arms.

Spooner fired a second shot that missed. He tried to fire a third one but his gun jammed.

Darius' mother, Patricia Larry, has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against Spooner.

Police searched Darius' home within hours of the shooting and didn't find Spooner's weapons.

Spooner
 testified at trial against his attorney's advice and said he killed the
 teen because he really wanted his guns back. He also acknowledged 
wanting to kill Darius' older brother when he ran to his sibling's aid 
as he lay dying in the street.

But Spooner said he didn't shoot the 
brother because he didn't want to hit any of the others who had gathered
 around.

Grieving: Patricia Larry, Darius Simmons' mother, watched as Spooner killed her son

When prosecutor 
Mark Williams suggested Spooner killed Darius as revenge for having his 
guns stolen, Spooner replied: 'I wouldn't call it revenge. I would call 
it justice.'

Larry recalled those words from Spooner as she asked the judge to prevent him from ever being eligible for parole.

'I
 want him to be accountable for what he did to my son, Darius Simmons. I
 want him to have life in prison,' she said at Monday's sentencing.

'He 
showed no remorse and said justice was served. He is a menace to 
society.'

The sentencing 
came about a week after former neighborhood watch volunteer George 
Zimmerman was acquitted in Florida in the February 2012 shooting death 
of Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was also unarmed. In the opening 
days of Spooner's trial in Milwaukee, the judge told the jury pool to 
separate the two cases.

During
 the trial, race – Spooner is white and Darius was black – was almost 
never mentioned, except when Spooner referred to his surveillance 
footage from the day of the burglary. It showed two black teenage males 
walking near his house from the direction of Darius' home. Their faces 
are difficult to identify and neither is carrying Spooner's guns.
