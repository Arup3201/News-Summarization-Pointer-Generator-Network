India and Pakistan’s leaders have vowed to heal the damaging rift between their countries.

The pledge came at the first visit of a Pakistan head of state to India in seven years.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and visiting Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari held their first meeting in nearly three years in India's capital New Delhi – and said it was friendly and constructive.

Mr Singh said: ‘Relations between India and Pakistan should become normal. That’s our common desire.’ 

Mr Zardari said: ‘We would like to have better relations.’

Tensions hit a new low after Pakistani terrorists slaughtered 166 people in Mumbai, India, in 2008.

The nations remain at loggerheads over their rival claims to the Himalayan region of Kashmir.

Mr Singh has accepted an invitation from Mr Zardari to visit Pakistan as soon as mutually acceptable dates are worked out. 

Before Sunday, the two had not seen each other since June 2009, when they met in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg.

'We have a number of issues, but we are willing to find practical and pragmatic solutions to all those issues,' Singh said. 'That’s the message President Zardari and I would like to convey.'

Although Zardari was in India on what was called a private religious trip, the visit gave him a chance to meet Indian leaders amid a thaw in relations between the two countries.

He later left for Ajmer Sharif, a revered Muslim shrine in India’s western state of Rajasthan.

Zardari’s visit to India is the most visible sign that the two countries have put behind them the enmity that followed the 2008 attacks in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai in which 10 Pakistani terrorists killed 166 people.

India has blamed the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group for the Mumbai attacks and demanded that Islamabad crack down on the militants.

Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told reporters that during their 40-minute meeting, the two leaders agreed to take a step-by-step approach to resolve the many long-standing problems that have dogged their countries’ relationship.

Singh told Zardari that 'it was imperative to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice and prevent activities aimed against India from Pakistani soil,' Mathai said. 

However, both sides remain far from resolving their conflict over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim.

Zardari was accompanied by about 25 family members, including his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who has been anointed his political heir.
