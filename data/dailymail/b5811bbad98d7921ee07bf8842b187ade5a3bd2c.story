CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report as a Sergio Aguero goal was enough to hand the home side victory

Manchester City made hard work of it after they scored. They looked to limp over the line and it was a far from convincing performance as they beat United 1-0.

Perhaps the CSKA Moscow result in the Champions League last month was playing on their minds, during which they shipped two goals to draw 2-2. 

Like that game, they lost momentum when they went ahead against United but this time they got away with it. They need to learn to finish teams off when they dominate.

The young lad Paddy McNair switched off for the goal. When I was growing up, I was always told to get touch-tight to my man in the box and to always be slightly in front of the striker so I could match his movement. It’s important McNair works on that.

They may have lost but I can see improvement in United. Louis van Gaal is seen as an innovator, and his tactics were interesting in the first half. Daley Blind dropped into defence while Wayne Rooney came very deep to receive the ball. 

Angel di Maria tucked in and Marouane Fellaini occupied the right. City did not know how to deal with United when they had the ball. But the visitors were exposed on the flanks when they lost possession. 

The second half saw a gallant effort from United — going down to 10 men forced them to give more, especially Rooney. However, it will be a worry for Van Gaal that Robin van Persie’s work-rate did not match the rest of the team.

People seem to be divided on Fellaini. His former manager David Moyes is right when he says he carries a threat and he had a good all-round game against City. But you have to take your chances and he fluffed his lines by missing that header.

It was vital City won this match, otherwise Chelsea could have had the title almost sewn up before Christmas. City might be the champions, but they are not playing like it at the moment. Manager Manuel Pellegrini will hope they can get their swagger back sooner rather than later.
