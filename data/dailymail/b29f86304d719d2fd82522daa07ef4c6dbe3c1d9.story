Roman Abramovich and his partner Darya Zhukova will supposedly stay in the hotel next week

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has booked all 111-rooms in the Beresheet Hotel in the Israeli desert resort of Mitzpe Ramon for next week's Jewish Passover holiday, a source close to the hotel told the Daily Mail.

Mr. Abramovich, who is Jewish, will reportedly fly to Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv in his private jet on Sunday with his partner Darya Zhukova and their children Aaron and Leah, and travel by limousine to the hotel.

It is believed he will host family and friends at the hotel between Sunday and Thursday - at an estimated cost of $450,000 - and that the highlight of the vacation will be a Passover banquet in a tent specially constructed in the desert.

During the Passover banquet Jews traditionally recount the story of the Exodus from Egypt and the source claimed Mr. Abramovich wants to be close to where the biblical action actually took place.

Beresheet Hotel has a stunning view of the 500 metre-deep Ramon Crater, the world's largest crater created by erosion.

Mr. Abramovich is going one better than the last time he spent Passover in Israel, in 2009, when he only he only rented an entire floor of 36 rooms in the Royal Beach Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Eilat.

The Beresheet Hotel is one of Israel's top resorts and has supposedly been fully booked by the oligarch

Mr. Abramovich is a frequent visitor to Israel. In the past year alone he has been to the country five times, including visits to technology incubators in Tel Aviv with a view to investing in high-tech startups and attending a fundraising event for an organization that carries out archeological excavations, which he supports financially.

Ms. Zhukova is a billionaire in her own right. A fashion designer and businesswoman, she was born in Russia but raised in California by her Jewish mother after her parents divorced.
