Raphael and Tamar Altman were found dead on their bed and left a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed'

The son of a couple who died after making a suicide pact kissed them both goodbye and gave them his blessing.

Tai Altman said he knew his parents Raphael, 69, and Tamar, 72, who had been married for 46 years, were going to kill themselves.

The coroner at an inquest in Oxford said it was clear the couple, who were both in poor health, had decided to end their lives together in a 'dignified' way.

The couple, from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, were found dead in each others arms after drinking poison. 

They were both supporters of Dignity in Dying, and had marked October 3, 2013 in their diary with the single word - ‘depart’.

Their son Mr Altman, 43, with his father's cancer reaching the final stages, he realised the time had come. He said he knew the devoted couple would choose to die together, if they could.

The father-of-three from Auldearn, near Inverness, said: 'We spent two days saying goodbye, we got the chance to say everything we wanted to say.

'I told them they had been good parents and I felt honoured to have had them and the values they had given me would be passed to their grandchildren.

'I wanted to give them a feeling that they would leave something tangible behind.'

The couple used the same lethal potion provided by Dignitas - the Swiss organisation which helps people end their lives.

At this week's inquest, the coroner passed a verdict of death by suicide.

The court heard how Mr and Mrs Altman turned down the lights, put on soothing music before pouring the liquid poison into a glass and a bowl.

Tai Altman said his father, a former religious education teacher, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2006 but he enjoyed a good quality of life until a few days before he died.

Mrs Altman suffered from diabetes, neuralgia and muscular problems and made it clear to her family she was not prepared to live without her husband.

'On more than one occasion I gave my mother a scenario in which she could stay,' Mr Altman said.

Tai Altman said the family spent two days saying goodbye, before he gave his parents - who were both in poor health - his blessing

'I told her she could move here and be with us and her grandchildren but she was not without her own physical ailments. She wasn’t about to relocate 500 miles. I didn’t argue about it.'

He spent two days with his parents at their home in Oxford in October, knowing it would be the last time he would see them alive.

'When my father lost the motor control of his body I knew it was close to the end,' he said.

'I did a lot of crying because I knew what was going to happen.

'We got him out of hospital on the Monday. He couldn’t walk, he couldn’t even feed himself.

'A few days earlier he was able to get up and down the stairs and take care of himself. It was good that happened so quickly. Who would want to spent months and months in pain?'

The family went back to Mr Altman’s parent’s home in Oxford and spent the next two days together.

'I had already asked them how they were going to do it,' he said. 'They said it was the same stuff that Dignitas uses, which is a chemical compound. I didn’t have any questions.

'I told them there was nothing I felt I had missed out on in life, there was not a single bit of regret.

'I knew that this was the chance to give them what they wanted. This was what all the talk had been about.

'He was immobile, she couldn’t support him, she couldn’t get him onto a commode. I knew that when I left they would do it soon.'

Mr Altman received an email from his father, as planned, telling him to contact their GP.

The doctor found the couple dead in their bed at their home in Great Milton, near Wheatley. Her head was resting on his shoulder, her arm over his chest.

'I always knew they were mated for life,' said Mr Altman, a driving instructor.

'They were hippies, dad was from Cape Town, mum was a New Yorker. Before they moved to England to raise us they set up a kibbutz, they lived on a Spanish island with other hippies with no running water or electricity. They were free-thinking people with their own mind set.'

Mr Altman believes the suicide potion was purchased 'surreptitiously' over the internet.

'I played no part in that,' he said. 'They were big campaigners of the right to die.

'My father gave evidence to a government commission on assisted dying. I understand their beliefs and I am happy to support the right to die.'

He added: 'Their send-off could not have been better but we had our fears.

'What if it didn’t work, or it only worked on one of them and dad was left lying there and he couldn’t move. If it had been legal we’d not have had to worry about any of that.'

Both Mr and Mrs Altman left a note indicating their plans and a letter to their GP, Dr Lynda Ware, thanking her for her years of care.

They emailed both their children and friends, saying their goodbyes.

Police called to the couple's home said the room was lit by a soft red light and soothing music was playing.

Mr Altman met his wife in the UK and after five years of friendship they became a couple.

They had two children, Tai and Tanyah, and ran a glass painting business for 10 years.

Mr Altman carried on having chemotherapy and radiotherapy after his diagnosis until last year.

As a right-to-die advocate, he gave evidence to the 2012 Government commission on assisted dying.

Mr Altman wrote an article in 1999 for Radiance Magazine, a journal for larger women, in which he praised his wife’s shape, calling her his 'fat Aphrodite'.

Assistant coroner Peter Clark said the couple had made a careful decision to end their lives in a 'dignified' way.

Recording verdicts of suicide, he said: 'It is clear they intended to die together as they lived together.'
