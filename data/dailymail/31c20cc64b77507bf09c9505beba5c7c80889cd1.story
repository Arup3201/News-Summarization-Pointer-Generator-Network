A helicopter has plunged to the ground in Seoul in a horrific crash that killed both pilots after its propeller clipped the side of one of the city's most expensive apartment buildings. 

Fire official Cha Yang-oh told reporters that the helicopter crashed in the upmarket Gangnam district - made famous by the hit music video Gangnam Style - in the south-east of the South Korean capital.  

The helicopter, belonging to LG Electronics, was on its way to a nearby landing field where it was scheduled to pick up LG employees and head to a city in the south of the country.

Cha said 57-year-old captain Park In-kyu died. A 36-year-old vice-captain survived the crash, but died later in a hospital.

LG Electronics Inc said the two pilots were company employees.

Seoul was foggy on Saturday morning but Cha declined to say if the thick fog played a role in the crash.

Cha said no one in the apartment 
block was hurt. The 38-storey I-Park building is one of the most 
expensive luxury apartment blocks in Seoul.

Damage: Windows shattered in the apartment block the helicopter's propeller clipped, but no residents were injured

'I
 heard a blast sound while I was sleeping, so I ran out. The boom 
sounded like a war had started,' said Jeong Young-woo, 54, an I-Park 
resident. 

TV footage 
showed shattered windows on the upper levels of the building. The 
helicopter was nearly totally destroyed save for its tail section. 

The fashionable district of Gangnam became globally famous due to South Korean rapper Psy's smash hit music video Gangnam Style.
