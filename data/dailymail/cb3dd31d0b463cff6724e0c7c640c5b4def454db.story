Graffiti artist Banksy has unveiled his latest work next to a quiet countryside waterway.

The picture of an origami heron holding a goldfish in its beak sprang up overnight in Lyme Regis, Dorset, on a wall next to the River Lym.

Although he eschewed the typically gritty urban settings for this artwork, it bore all the hallmarks of the mysterious artist and its authenticity was confirmed when he posted it his website.

Quiet countryside setting: Unlike usual graffiti, Banksy's work has been known to cause the values of nearby property to skyrocket

It is the second new Banksy piece to have appeared this month, after another was painted on the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey, north London.

That rather more political piece showed a young boy hunched over a sewing machine with real Union Flag bunting attached - a dark reflection on the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Someone later removed the bunting, which was similar to a kind sold in the nearby discount shop.

In the past, graffiti by the elusive artist has the values of nearby property to skyrocket. In 2008, a Portobello Road wall adorned with his name fetched £200,000 on eBay.

His work is known for its strident anti-establishment message, which has done nothing to damage his popularity among celebrities and the super-rich – his 2010 film Exit Through The Gift Shop was nominated for an Oscar.

At the 2004 Notting Hill Carnival, the prankster handed out spoof British £10 notes substituting the picture of the Queen’s head with Diana, Princess of Wales head and changing the text 'Bank of England' to 'Banksy of England'.
