If you know someone who’s recently undergone a transformation – lost weight, toned up, suddenly seem incredibly smiley all the time – perhaps they’ve become a client of Bodyism. It has become such a phenomenon that Londoners in-the-know refer to that 'Bodyism glow'.

For Bodyism has become the gym in London. Founded by James Duigan seven years ago, it recently moved to new premises at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, and is patronised by the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Hugh Grant and countless other supermodels and Hollywood A-listers.

The rumour mill is abuzz that an LA outpost will open later in 2013. Duigan’s accompanying Clean and Lean diet and exercise books (Clean & Lean, Flat Tummy Fast, Clean & Lean Cookbook and Warrior) have become bestsellers, and the gym’s Body Brilliance shakes - which stars like Rosie regularly tweet about - went global in January.

Bodyism is far more than just a place to come to work out and tone up; it’s a mecca for anyone with body issue demons to exorcise.

The level of post-session support is such that, if you’re having trouble making the right food choices, you can even text Bodyism staff for guidance. The positive attitude is infectious and the overall effect is cathartic, as any devotee will tell you.

'It's not like you come in to do a healing session, but it is just a very healing place,' says James Duigan. 'It’s not so much what we do, it’s why we do it – and the reason we do it is to change people’s lives.'

At Bodyism, the crack team of trainers 
rotates, so that your sessions are always interesting and challenging, 
you reap the benefit of different experts’ specialities, and you won’t 
be knocked off your fitness course if one of them is away.

Your attitude to your own health and fitness is key to your level of success, says Duigan.

'It's not about 'What's more important, food or exercise?' It's the attitude. You can't really have one without the other,' he explains. In short: it's a holistic approach.

'I want to change your mind-set as well as your shape,' continues Duigan.

'I believe that if we start changing the conversations people have with themselves, then we can really take the shame and guilt away from people’s relationship with food.'

So your trainer might talk to you about your emotional food triggers, for example.

'But it’s not like in the middle of a session we say ‘Ok, we’re going to talk about the mentality now. That’s part and parcel of the session.'

If you feel like some super intensive treatment, you could always move in to the hotel, have your daily training session in the gym and the indoor pool, and eat only the Duigan Clean and Lean menu – even couples are doing it together.

'I truly believe that Bodyism was born when we moved to the Bulgari,' says Duigan. 'Because it gave us the facilities we need, this amazing, beautiful space and infrastructure to take us to the next level.'

And how Duigan feels about the Bulgari is pretty much how clients feel about Bodyism. A next level never seemed so easy – and pleasurable – to achieve.
