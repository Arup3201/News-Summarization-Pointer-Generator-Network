While most Christmas cards might have a pretty picture of a church in the snow, Santa on his sleigh or another suitable festive scene, the same can’t be said for this one sent out by council officials.

The ‘insulting’ card was sent to social housing tenants in 17,000 properties by Hammersmith and Fulham Council in West London, reminding them to avoid ‘overindulging’ and to pay their rent.

It shows a pound coin fizzing in a glass of water like a tablet, with a picture of holly and ivy - and the slogan ‘Don't overindulge this Christmas. Pay your rent!’.

The council also printed a message underneath the image saying ‘If you are having trouble paying your rent, we want to help', before including a telephone number with which to contact them.

But Tina Buckley, 43, who has lived in a council property with her 82-year-old mother Mary for 25 years, said the card made her angry because they have never been behind with their rent.

She told BBC London: ‘When we were young and there wasn't much money, she would pay her rent before she would feed us and clothe us and heat the house.

‘Keeping the roof over our head was more important than anything else so to get this disgusting, threatening piece of literature masquerading as a Christmas greeting, it's insulting.’

However, the council said the cards - which cost around £2,000 to produce - formed part of a ‘hard-hitting’ campaign that was required because 46 per cent of its tenants were in rent arrears.

A council spokesman said: ‘The real issue was to say if you are in difficulty give us a call. I think we've got to take all reasonable steps possible to make sure people pay their rent.’

A similar card was sent out by housing association Derwent Living to tenants in 1,000 homes in Derby earlier this month, saying: 'There’s no break from paying your rent this Christmas. Keep your account up-to-date over the festive season.'
