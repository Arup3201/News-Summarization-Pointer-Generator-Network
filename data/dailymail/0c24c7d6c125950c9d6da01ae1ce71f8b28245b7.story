Medic: Capt Bruce Kevin Clark died under unknown circumstances on Monday at an army base in Afghanistan

The family of a Texas-based Army medic serving in Afghanistan says his wife witnessed the officer's death, which happened as the two were video chatting via Skype.

Captain Bruce Kevin Clark suddenly looked 'alarmed' and disappeared from his wife's computer screen during a conversation on Monday, according to an Army spokesman.

'Mrs Clark was Skypeing from the family home here in El Paso with her 
husband when he all of a sudden fell away from the computer keyboard and
fell out of sight,' said Colonel John Modell.

'He assumed an alarmed look and fell back out of the picture,' he continued.

A spokesman at the William Beaumont Army Medical Center told MailOnline that Capt Bruce Kevin Clark's death on Monday came from natural causes and was not combat-related or suicide.

Clark's family in upstate New York released a statement saying Clark was having a regular Skype chat with his wife in El Paso when she witnessed her husband's death.

It said: 'Bruce's wife tragically witnessed her husband's death during one of their regular Skype video chats. At the time of the incident, the family was hoping for a rescue and miracle, but later learned that it was not to be.

'Although the circumstances were 
unimaginable, Bruce's wife and extended family will be forever thankful 
that he and his wife were together in his last moments.'

The
Pentagon has said only that the 43-year-old officer was formerly from 
Spencerport, New York, and that his death is under investigation.

Clark
was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso and
deployed in March. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, aged 
three and nine.Â 

U.S. and Australian special operations soldiers in Afghanistan honored Clark this week, according to the statement.

Clark was assigned to A Company, Troop Command at Beaumont.

According to the El Paso Times, his 
awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Award, Military 
Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Medal.

On Thursday night flags flew at half-mast in the Addison, Michigan, area where his mother Cindy Hallenbeck lives and a donation jar with his picture on it was set out by a local store.

A Facebook page has been created in Clark's honor and tributes have been flooding in.

A friend wrote on his Facebook page: 'The love Bruce had for his wife and girls is what I remember the most. He was a string nurse who was always a team player. We will miss him! Just consider myself lucky to have met him.'

Former Addison firefighter Ed Lawson wrote: 'More than just helping me learn the ropes at the (fire department), he helped me learn that being strong and being compassionate can go together.

He never knew it but in his way, he also helped me find my way back to God. Awesome man, husband and father, friend who is missed already.'

Shortly after moving to Spencerport in 2000, Clark and his wife had a daughter. As he worked as a volunteer firefighter, Clark enrolled at The College at Brockport, where he decided to pursue a career in nursing.

When he was approached about joining the military, he decided to pursue both passions as he 'really wanted to serve his country'.

After graduating in 2006, Clark moved his family to Hawaii, where he was stationed. There, he had another daughter. His next assignment was in El Paso, Texas. He rose to the rank of Captain and Chief Nurse, according to YNN.

His sister-in-law Mariana told the news channel they are still in the dark about what happened: 'There really still is a big question mark.

'On Tuesday, military called my sister and told her that Kevin had not made
it, and that there would be an investigation and that was the only 
thing they would tell her.'

No matter how he died, Mariana knows it was in service of his country; 
putting others before himself. That's the way, she says, he deserves to 
be remembered.

'He didn't want anyone to suffer, and that's what made him an amazing 
nurse. It's what made him an amazing father, brother, husband, and son.'
