The parents of murdered schoolgirl Alice Gross have said how the 'future looks bleak' without their daughter, who is thought to have been killed by a convicted murderer. 

Hundreds of mourners were moved to tears after a recording of the talented musician singing  Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah  was played at her memorial service today.

Her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss described the pain she feels when talking about Alice and said she 'cannot imagine life without her'. 

The 14-year-old disappeared in August and despite the biggest police search since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings, her body was not found until more than a month later.

Rosalind Hodgkiss said the killing of her daughter had left her numb with grief, and the future looked bleak 

Alice Gross, 14, was a talented musician and a recording of Hallelujah she produced was played at the service

Hundreds of people turned out for the ceremony in Middlesex, organised by Alice Gross' family to thank them 

Speaking at the ceremony her mother, Rosalind Hodgkiss said: 'I have been numbed by shock and grief, I have felt outrage and anger at the loss of her life and unbelievable sadness at the emptiness that has been left.

'I have wracked my brains for all the 'what ifs' of that day, anything that might have stopped this random, incomprehensible tragedy.

'It is even harder to talk about that pain than it is to talk about Alice. I cannot imagine life without Alice.' 

The teenager who was a talented musician, played piano, violin and ukulele and had started to learn the guitar.

Dozens of people turned out for the memorial service held today in tribute to Alice and their efforts to find her

Alice wrote and sang her own songs and a recording was played on Sunday, with her father playing the guitar 

Footage of the teenager singing was shown on large screens during the memorial service held today 

During the service, held at Greenford Town Hall in Middlesex, a recording of her singing and playing violin to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah was played, with her father joining her on guitar. A video was also shown on a big screen at Greenford Hall in London of her performing one of her own songs, called Don't Go Away.

Ms Hodgkiss added: 'I think of all the ... hugs, shared jokes, evenings spent snuggled on the sofa, goodnight kisses, the confidence of after-school conversations, Alice playing the piano in her dressing gown (and) singing, shopping, baking, the way Alice still called me 'mummy'.

'The future seems bleak without Alice.' 

Alice was last seen alive on August 28 on CCTV 

She said the things she would miss most would be celebrating her daughter's birthday, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and her own birthday.

Ms Hodgkiss said her daughter could be shy and often did not realise the extent of her musical talent. 

She added: 'I think of all the every day moments. Hugs, shared jokes, evenings spent snuggled on the sofa.

'Alice was loving and kind in so many ways. I had recently been training for a hundred mile charity walk.

'When I came home from a (training session) Alice cooked me breakfast. She took a photo because she was proud of how she made it.

'She showed her love in little acts of kindness. Alice was fizzy and fun with a lovely sense of humour.

'She laughed loud and often and we often laughed with her.' 

The teenager was buried during a private ceremony 10 days ago but today's service was held  by the family to thank the community for their help in trying to find their daughter. 

Ms Hodgkiss said support from the community had not made the loss of Alice any more bearable but had 'restored some of our faith in humanity.'

Alice's father, Jose Gross told the service it has been 'very difficult to deal with this sudden, dramatic and tragic event'. 

He described walking her to primary school through woods and trees and how they both missed that time together. 

Mr Gross also told how they had planned to play 'open mic' nights together, saying: 'I think we would have been quite high in the 'aahhhh' factor, beautiful teenage daughter sings with old rock veteran dad,' raising a laugh from well wishers.

Hundreds of mourners turned up to pay tribute to the talented musician from Hanwell, in west London today

Several people were left in tears after a video of Alice playing piano and singing an original composition 'Don't let it Go Away' was played. 

A tribute from Alice's sister Nina was read by Caroline Black, a renowned humanist.

Nina said: 'Alice was a kind and thoughtful sister. She could always make me laugh with her funny voices and silly faces.

'I wish I could have had a last chance to go on a walk with you in the rain.

'I do find peace in knowing that nothing can hurt you any more.'

The 14-year-old was last seen alive walking along a tow path in west London on August 28, and it is believed that she was murdered by convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who was caught on CCTV following her on his bike.

It was more than a month before her body was found weighted down in the bed of the River Brent, near where she lived in Hanwell, west London. 

Zalkalns, who had previously served seven years for murdering his wife Rudite in his native Latvia, was found hanged in nearby Boston Manor Park on October 4, four weeks after he was reported missing to the police.

Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss launched an appeal to find Alice after she went missing on August 28 

Dozens of family and friends laid tributes including bright yellow flowers for Alice's funeral, held 10 days ago 

Hanwell Clock Tower has become the focus of tributes since the teenager's body was found in September 

Detectives are understood to have found DNA to link him to the murder and are now examining files for cases of missing women since 2007, when Zalkalns moved to the UK, the Sunday People reported.

After Alice's body was found in September the clock tower in Hanwell became a focus for mourners - many of whom laid flowers and left yellow ribbons in tribute to the teenager.

Mr Gross added: 'For five or so weeks the area became emblazoned in yellow ribbons, delivering a very powerful message of support to the public at large and anyone passing by.

'No one could pass through Hanwell and beyond without being aware that Alice was missing and that the community cared.

Convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns is thought to have murdered Alice, 14, and was later found dead 

'When I felt very low the sight of the ribbons lifted my spirits.'

The service also included photos of Alice visiting Disneyland.

Family friend Anna Bradley read William Wordsworth poem 'Surprised by Joy' by another friend Anna Bradley.

Many of Alice's music teachers also performed at the service. 

Serena Kay, her singing teacher, sang We're Walking In The Air, from the cartoon Christmas film The Snowman. 

A sonnet written especially for the occasion by poet Brian Clark, was also read out by Julian Bell, the leader of Ealing Council. 

The highly emotional service was attended by family members, friends, teachers, local MPs and representatives from the police, fire brigade, Youth Music and Ealing Council. 

The community in Hanwell has shown a lot of support to the family. A Facebook page set up to help find Alice attracted 22,000 followers, yellow ribbons appeared tied to railings, buildings and other structures across the area. 

Some people also helped with the search to find the missing teenager. Around 6,000 runners in the Ealing Half Marathon also wore ribbons. 

A donations page has been set up following the service for Alice's Youth Music Memorial Fund.

David O'Keeffe, spokesman for the National Foundation for Youth Music, which will benefit from the fund, said: 'All of us at Youth Music are very grateful to the family for setting up Alice's Youth Music Memorial Fund in her memory.

'This will be a great help to us in continuing our work to provide music-making opportunities to over 90,000 young people every year.

'Many of them face significant challenges in their lives such as coping with poverty, disability, special needs or perhaps living in care.

'I imagine and hope from what I've heard today that Alice herself would have been pleased to have created a legacy to help these young people experience the joys of music making, as she did.'
