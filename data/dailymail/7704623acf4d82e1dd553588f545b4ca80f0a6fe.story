Criticised: John Griffith-Jones has been attacked for giving HBOS a clean bill of health in the run-up to its collapse

The chairman of the new City regulator is facing calls to step down for failing to sound the alarm about reckless lending at HBOS.

Financial Conduct Authority boss John Griffith-Jones previously chaired the accountancy firm KPMG, which has been  criticised for giving HBOS a clean bill of health in the run-up to  its collapse.

The calls came as David Cameron refused to push for former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby to be stripped of his knighthood or demand that his pension be slashed for his disastrous stewardship of the bank.

Between 2008 and 2011 Lloyds, which took over HBOS under a  government-backed rescue deal, racked up £46billion of losses from bad loans made by its former rival.

Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBOS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised concerns about the bank’s reckless lending, said: ‘The position of John Griffith-Jones as head of the regulator is clearly untenable.

‘This is the man who chaired a company which failed to check HBOS’s accounts properly.’

Last night the FCA hit back at accusations of a conflict of interest and insisted that Mr Griffith-Jones will not be involved in the regulator’s report into the demise of HBOS, due to be published later this year. The authority said: ‘John Griffith-Jones was subject to a rigorous appointment process by HM Treasury, and had an appointment hearing with the Treasury Select Committee, to assess his suitability for the role.’

KPMG said the firm ‘stands by the quality of its audit’.

Downing Street yesterday signalled that the Prime Minister will not intervene over Sir James’s knighthood as he did last year when he called for Fred Goodwin to lose his over the collapse of RBS.

Officials said the Government would investigate ways of holding HBOS executives to account, but not until the FCA review and a report by the Insolvency Service are completed in the coming months.

Refused: David Cameron has ignored calls for former HBOS chief Sir James Crosby, right, to be stripped of his knighthood after his disastrous stewardship of the bank

Last year Mr Cameron said the Cabinet Office’s Forfeiture Committee, which decides on honours, should look at Sir Fred. But yesterday No 10 said the Prime Minister would not be referring the case of Sir James to the committee.

The row will add to a growing fury over his gold-plated pension worth around £700,000 a year. If HBOS had been allowed to go bust, rather than being rescued by Lloyds, he would have received a fraction of this.

The Pension Protection Fund, which rescues the pensions of failed firms, sets a cap on how much it will pay workers who have retired early, like Sir James.

In 2008 – when HBOS would have gone under – it set a cap of just £24,788 a year for people of his age, then 52, who had taken early retirement.
