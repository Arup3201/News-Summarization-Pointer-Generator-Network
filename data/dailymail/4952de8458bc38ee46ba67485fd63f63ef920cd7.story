Two friends battered a sheep to death with a hammer and cut off its legs in a field so they could have a free roast dinner, a court heard.

Matthew Davidson, 28, and Kevin Sherratt, 33, stole the mutilated remains and paraded the animal's head around.

But their drunken prank on a farm in Macclesfield, Cheshire, backfired when they sent photos of what they had done to a friend who alerted police.

Mutilation: Matthew Davidson, 28, can be seen attacking the lamb which had two of its legs removed and its head torn off in Macclesfield, Cheshire

The pair sent the friend five pictures of themselves slaughtering and mutilating the sheep with a blade.

In a reference to their Sunday lunch, Sherratt said in a sick jokey text message: 'Lamb sorted. Only Yorkshires needed now'.

He also said the whole incident was 'well funny' and they had been thinking about what they were going to eat the next day.

Davidson and Sherratt, both unemployed and from Macclesfield, admitted criminal damage and theft of the sheep before magistrates in the town.

Simon Pover, prosecuting, said: 'On April 26, the farmer discovered one of the hoggits (year-old lambs) had been killed and its body mutilated. Its remains were found on a footpath. Both hind legs and the head had been removed.

Boasts: Kevin Sherratt, 33, jokes to his friend 'that's Sunday dinner lamb sorted' after sending a friend a picture of what they had done

'On April 25 at 8pm, a friend known to both defendants received a text message from Davidson asking "you up for killing a cow, pal?".

'At 11pm that same night he received a text message from Sherratt saying "seriously mate how much fun we had, oh my days". He then received five pictures of the men slaughtering and mutilating the sheep with a knife or blade.

'In another picture Davidson was stood in Sherratt's home holding up the lamb's head. Another text said: "Lamb sorted. Only Yorkshires needed now".'

Mr Pover said other messages bragged about the brutal killing.

One text from Davidson said: 'I hope we didn't scare you with all this. We were a bit (drunk) and thought about Sunday dinner. It was funny when the hammer went through that skull. Think I might have found my new career as a butcher not a builder'.'

Another from Sherratt said: 'It was well funny. I held it down and said do not hit my hand with that hammer. What does he do, but on the killer blow hit my hand with the hammer. It hurt my knuckle. He is a lunatic.'

The police found bags containing the animal's body parts and bloodied tools in a shed at Sherratt's home.

Mr Pover told the court: 'Sherratt told police they were drunk at home and decided they wanted a roast dinner. He said he had hunted smaller animals.

'They decided to kill a sheep and got a claw hammer and serrated knife. They went to a field during the night, caught a sheep by running alongside it, pushing it and pinning it to the floor.

'He said the first blow killed it but they took an extra two or three strokes to make sure. They both skinned the animal.

'Davidson told police he had spent three days at Sherratt's house and been drunk throughout. He couldn't remember much but recalled being in a field with a sheep.'

Trevor Feehily, defending, said the incident had been triggered by alcohol.

He said: 'It doesn't excuse what either of them have done. Both said it was drunken and complete stupidity.'

Police wanted to charge Davidson and Sherratt with animal cruelty, but they could not prove the sheep had suffered.

They will be sentenced on June 7.
