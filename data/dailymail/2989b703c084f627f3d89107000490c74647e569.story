For seven days they evaded capture in the Caribbean while running up thousands of pounds on credit cards ‘living like there was no tomorrow’.

But yesterday the two boarding school runaways were finally tracked down – and had to face a furious mother.

Sixth-formers Edward Bunyan, 16, and Indira Gainiyeva, who turned 17 during their jaunt, had sparked an international manhunt after sneaking out of their £30,000-a-year boarding school last Monday and boarding a flight to the Dominican Republic.

End of the party: Suzannah Bunyan looked stern as she ushered son Eddy Bunyan, 16, into a car to go home

They originally checked into a 
five-star hotel on the island where they are believed to have spent 
several days enjoying lavish meals and cocktails.

But,
 fearing the authorities were closing in, they moved to a rundown 
£75-a-week apartment block where they hoped to remain under the radar. 
They were finally caught late on Sunday when plain clothes police found 
them sitting at a beachside restaurant in the resort of Punta Cana.

They told police: ‘We’re having a great time and want to stay.’

Ramon
 Brito, spokesman for the local tourist police, said: ‘We located them 
by tracing their credit cards. They spent Sunday night at the Sol Caribe
 apartments, in the Los Corales resort in Bavaro. We confirmed that they
 were there, contacted their parents, and the police went in to take 
them to be reunited with their families.

‘The
 hotel owners won’t face any procedures – the youngsters came for a good
 time and behaved well, so there was never any danger to them or 
others.’

The pair were later reunited with Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, who had flown out to help the search.

Yesterday
 morning she frogmarched the sheepish couple from their bolthole to a 
taxi and reluctantly returned them to the luxury hotel where she had 
checked in.

She later accompanied them for a meeting at the police 
station flanked by motorcycle outriders.

The pair have been on a week-long escapade, fleeing officials as they hop from one five-star resort to the next. Ms Bunyan carried the luggage as a sullen-looking Indira Gainiyeva, 17, stood behind waiting to get into the car

Action: The couple, who have been dating for seven months, face police questioning back in the UK

A source said: ‘Edward’s mother is very, very angry but also hugely relieved and wants to know what got into the pair.

‘She
 desperately wants to know whether her son has been unhappy at boarding 
school and whether he really wants to go back there. But she is also 
very angry at what they did. We understand this stunt cost thousands of 
pounds which he racked up on his credit card. It was like he was living 
like there was no tomorrow.’

Their
 adventure began last Monday when they left Stonyhurst College in 
Clitheroe, Lancashire, at 3am and took a taxi to Manchester airport for a
 flight to the Caribbean.

On the run: The couple were believed to be staying in a room similar to this one when they were found

They spent the week jumping from one five-star hotel to another until police traced their credit card payments

After
 British police alerted Interpol, local officers spent days scouring 250
 miles of coastline packed with resorts.

They finally traced them via 
their credit cards at the luxury Occidental Grand Hotel in Punta Cana, 
which boasts three swimming pools, a spa, tennis courts, nine 
restaurants, seven bars and live nightly shows.

But
 by the time officers arrived on Sunday they had moved half a mile away 
to a one-bedroomed apartment in a shabby block a ten-minute walk from 
the beach.

They were also more frugal, stocking up on bread and water and dining at cheap beachside restaurants.

The pair were traced to the Sol Carib apartment complex in Punta Cana on the island

Indira's oil-rich family refused to fly out to the resort as they had no way of tracing the so-called 'Bonnie and Clyde'

Fellow pupils took to Twitter to try to trace their whereabouts as the couple turned off their mobile phones

This is the beach front bar area where the couple were found on Sunday night before Eddy's mother arrived

The Roman Catholic school has refused to reveal what action will be taken over their escapade

At
 around 11pm on Sunday police moved in and picked them up. It is 
understood that they are now in separate rooms at the Occidental and 
that Mrs Bunyan will act as guardian to Indira for the journey back to 
Britain later this week.

Indira’s
 father, Ravil Gainiyev, a businessman in Kazakhstan, said: ‘Everything 
is under control. We now want to take Indira home, back to Kazakhstan.’

It is understood that he and Indira’s mother Firuza spoke to their 
daughter by phone after she was found, but they declined to talk about 
the call.

Eddy Bunyan was described by friends as 'a bit of a rebel'. Indira's parents believe she fell in love with him

Stonyhurst College in Lancashire prides itself on its high-end security measures

Stonyhurst headmaster Andrew Johnson said staff were delighted
 the pair had been found safe and well but would not be drawn on whether
 they would be expelled.

The
 college had earlier defended its security measures, saying they were 
intended to keep out intruders, not to ‘imprison’ pupils.

Lancashire
 police said: ‘They will be given a welfare de-brief by police following
 their arrival back in this country. This will signal an end of police 
involvement in this matter.’
