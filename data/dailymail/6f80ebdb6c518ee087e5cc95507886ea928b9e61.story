Tragic: Jason Redgrave had arrived at Karly Hopson's home to babysit little Ethan so she could go out for a friend's birthday

A mother's new boyfriend allegedly shook her six-month-old son to death while babysitting him after being angered by a row with his ex-girlfriend.

Jason Redgrave, 24, had arrived at girlfriend of one month Karly Hopson's home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, to babysit little Ethan so she could go out for a friend's birthday.

But he allegedly turned up in a bad mood following the row with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his three-year-old son after she refused to tell him where she was going on a night out, Hull Crown Court heard.

Prosecuting, Nicholas Lumbley, QC, said Redgrave had been constantly texting a
male friend before Miss Hopson had even left the house.

He then allegedly shook or slapped the 
baby so hard it caused major brain injuries which lead to his death, the court was told.

Mr Lumbley told the jury: 'Ethan Hopson was a 
perfectly healthy, happy boy who was normal in every way, other than the
odd snuffle or bug.

He 'would have had his first birthday this 
week. The fact he has not done so is because this man shook and hit him 
with such force that he suffered from head injuries from which he never 
recovered.

'The prosecution says that this 
defendant is guilty of murder. While he may not have set out to kill 
him, he caused these injuries and he did so causing really serious harm,
even if there was only a momentary intent to cause that harm.'

Redgrave told police he had played with Ethan before putting him to bed and had then 
returned downstairs to watch the MTV awards and Match of the Day.

He 
said he had gone upstairs to check on Ethan after hearing him scream, the court heard.

Redgrave told police he had picked the baby up and 
soothed him, rocking him back to sleep. At about 10pm he said he heard 
another scream and went upstairs to look. After settling the baby again he went back downstairs.

But, around 10.45pm, during a first
game interval in Match of the Day, Redgrave made a 'purely speculative' 
check on Ethan and told police he found him lifeless.

He said he 
put his finger in the baby's palm, but there had been no
response.

The jury listened to a 999 made by Redgrave after he called Miss Hopson who then 
raced home.

Redgrave told the operator: 'I am 
looking after my girlfriend’s baby and he is barely breathing. He is not
clutching my hand or anything. He is six months old. I have laid him 
down flat because I don’t know what position to put him in.'

Asked by the operator: 'Is he awake?' Redgrave replied: 'No! No!'

'Is he unconscious?' the operator asked. Redgrave replied: 'I think he is. I
don’t think he has a pulse. Please! Please come! Oh S***! I can’t hear 
any breathing. Oh my God he’s gone! He’s gone!'

Victim: Ethan Hopson died later in Sheffield Hospital as a result of numerous non-accidental injuries, the court heard

The line then went dead,' the court heard.

Miss Hopson arrived home
to find her son on the sofa with a paramedic and asked Redgrave what 
had happened.

Mr Lumbley told the court that Redgrave had explained how he had gone upstairs to check on Ethan and he was
not breathing properly.

'He said he had picked him up and his head had 
rolled back and that was when he sent a text message to Karly, saying "Karly ring me now!"'

Mr Lumbley added Redgrave had told her in a panic: 'They are going to think I have done it. I am going to go to prison.'

Redgrave then sent a text message to his ex girlfriend asking her to ring him, which she did. He gave her the same account, Mr Lumbley said.

Ethan Hopson died later in Sheffield Hospital as a result of numerous non-accidental injuries, the court heard.

Miss Hopson had overheard Redgrave say: 'I feel sick' when police approached him at the hospital.

After they had arrested him, Redgrave told them: 'It's at times like this I wish I had
a bag to put over my head,' the court heard.

There was evidence of a slap to the left side of Ethan's face, bruising between the eyes and two deep skull bruises beneath the 
scalp near his left ear.

There were tears to tissue 
consistent with acceleration and declaration of the head as if it had 
been shaken, the court heard.There was also widespread and severe damage to the 
brain caused by lack of oxygen.

Mr Lumbley said the type of injuries Ethan suffered suggested there was a deliberate intention to apply force and that the jury could be sure there was a case for murder.

Redgrave told police he would never 
hurt a child and did nothing that night to injure the baby. He admitted 
when pressed: 'I picked him up and shook him and rocked him to sleep. I 
put him back down to sleep. I did not harm him in any way. If I was 
going to harm a child I would harm my own baby first. I did not do 
anything to that child to cause those injuries.'

Redgrave, of central Grimsby, denies a charge of murder and separate charge of 
manslaughter.

The case continues.
