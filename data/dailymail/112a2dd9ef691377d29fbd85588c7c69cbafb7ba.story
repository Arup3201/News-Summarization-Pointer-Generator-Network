The man suspected of hacking a soldier to death on a London street was best friends at school with a war hero who died in Iraq.

Friends said Michael Adebolajo, who was filmed holding a knife in blood-covered hands after Drummer Lee Rigby was brutally killed in Woolwich on Wednesday, had to be consoled at the funeral of Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath in 2007.

L/Cpl Redpath's younger brother Grant, 26, told The Sun that Adebolajo went to their house in Romford, Essex, nearly every day after school during his teenage years.

Killed: L/Cpl Redpath died when an IED blew up his Land Rover near Basra

Classmates: The pair were close during their teenage years while studying at Marshalls Park School in Romford, Essex

Footage: Michael Adebolajo was filmed clutching knives at the scene of the attack

He said: 'I don’t know what happened to Michael because he used to be the most 
laid-back, nicest guy in the world. But I know that if my brother were 
alive today he’d want to try and make him see sense.'

Former classmates of the pair described Adebolajo's suspected involvement in the Woolwich killing as tantamount to 'dancing on Kirk's grave'.

Adebolajo and L/Cpl Redpath were classmates at Marshalls Park School and both came from loving, Catholic families, Mr Redpath said.

He said he had recognised him when footage of him ranting about Islam. In the video, obtained by ITV News.

In the footage, Adeboljo is seen saying: ‘We swear by the almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone.

'We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

'I
apologise that women have had to witness this today, but in our land 
our women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove 
your government, they don't care about you.'

Mr Redpath added there was never any indication at school that Adebolajo would convert to Islam.

After
they finished school Adebolajo's family moved to Lincolnshire and L/Cpl
Redpath joined the Army where he was a drummer - like Lee Rigby.

The
soldier, who was in the 1st Battalion, The Irish Guards, died aged just
22 when an IED blew up his Land Rover on an operation near Basra. 

Other former schoolfriends of the pair expressed anger at what they saw as a betrayal of L/Cpl Redpath by Adebolajo.

Tributes: Flowers and messages were left at the scene in honour of Lee Rigby

One, an insurance clerk, 28, told The Sun: 'It 
makes me sick to the stomach that Michael could betray Kirk’s memory 
like this... It all seems so long since I saw
them both having fun when they were 15.'

Another former friend, who is now a welder, 28, said: 'It’s hard to imagine that the same man who we consoled at Kirk’s 
funeral went out on to a London street and killed a soldier in the name 
of Islam.

'What kind of madness is that? He saw with his own eyes the pain and 
suffering caused by Kirk’s death — but he inflicted the same sorrow on 
another family.'
