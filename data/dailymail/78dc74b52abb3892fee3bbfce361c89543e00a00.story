With the holy city of Mecca lit up spectacularly in the background, hundreds of devout Muslim pilgrims make their way up sacred Noor Mountain ahead of the annual Haj rituals which are set begin later this week.

The mountain, known in Arabic as Jabal-al-noor or the Mountain of Light is the site of Hira Cave which is where Muslims believe Mohammed received his first revelations from God through the angel Gabriel.

Millions of pilgrims are set to descend on Mecca this week to perform the haj, the world's largest annual gathering of any kind which authorities in Saudi Arabia insist will not be affected by instability shaking the region.

Top of the world: Officials say the main events, which begin on Wednesday, are expected to attract more than two million devotees

Walking in groups, mostly led by 
guides with their countries' flags printed on their garments, faithful 
men and women have poured into Mecca to perform the minor pilgrimage, or
 umrah, ahead of the major haj rituals.

Officials
 say the main events, which begin Wednesday, are expected to attract 
more than two million devotees from across the world.

Thursday marks the most important day,
 when all pilgrims assemble in the Arafat plain outside Mecca. The 
pilgrimage ends after Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which will
 be celebrated on Friday.

The haj is one of the five pillars of Islam that every capable Muslim must perform at least once in lifetime.

'It's
 my first time in Mecca for pilgrimage. I can't wait to pray in Arafat,'
 said 32-year-old Koara Abdulrahman, a businessman from Burkina Faso.

Inside
 the Grand Mosque, scores of pilgrims continually circumambulate the 
cube-shaped Kaaba -- in which direction Muslims worldwide pray -- with 
many pushing their way through the crowds to kiss the walls of the 
structure that was first built by Abraham, according to the Islamic 
faith.

Others pray or recite verses of the holy book Koran, while many sleep in corners.

'Right
 now, I've got all the good feelings you can think of,' said an Iranian 
pilgrim, her voice quivering and tears welling up in her eyes.

Authorities said more than 1.6 million foreign pilgrims have already arrived and the numbers are set to grow by Wednesday. Around 750,000 domestic pilgrims are also expected to take part in the rituals.

Despite several checkpoints on the 
roads leading to Mecca to prevent illegal pilgrims, huge numbers of 
unauthorised devotees also join the hajj every year.

A bulk of pilgrims are from Asia, mostly from Indonesia which has the highest hajj quota.

It
 was unclear how many Syrians, whose country is being rocked by a civil 
war that began with a popular uprising against President Bashar 
al-Assad's regime 19 months ago, will make the journey.

Damascus
 claimed in September that Saudi authorities have barred Syrians from 
travelling to this year's haj after the two sides failed 'to reach 
consensus.'

But on Saturday Saudi Interior Minister Prince Ahmad bin Abdul Aziz insisted that pilgrims from Syria are not being barred, except those who sent in their applications too late.

The Saudi envoy to Lebanon said last week that the kingdom will also grant visas to Syrians in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where thousands of refugees who have fled the violence are being accommodated.

Prince Ahmad also warned that Riyadh 
will not allow the haj to be 'politicised' and told reporters the 
kingdom was not worried that trouble in Syria and other Arab countries 
could affect the hajj or that pilgrims from its regional arch-foe Iran 
would cause any disturbance.

'I
 don't expect pilgrims or the pilgrimage to be affected by what is 
taking place elsewhere, whether Syria or any other place,' he said.

'We don't expect any' unrest to be caused by Iranians, he added.

Iranian
 pilgrims annually stage a 'repudiation of polytheists' rally -- a 
ritual promoted by the late Islamic republic's revolutionary leader 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to denounce the West and Israel.

In 
1987, police attempts to stifle the anti-US and anti-Israeli 
demonstration sparked clashes in which 402 people died, including 275 
Iranians.

Iranian pilgrims have since held their rallies in tents
 without provoking clashes with security forces in the Sunni-dominated 
kingdom.

'The Iranians have assured us that they are as concerned about the comfort of pilgrims as we are," Prince Ahmad told a news conference that followed a military parade by security forces and civil defence.

Despite marred by deadly incidents in the past such as floodings, stampedes, and fires, hajj has become nearly incident-free over the past few years -- thanks to the multi-billion projects being implemented every year.

This year alone, the kingdom spent more than 1.1 billion riyals ($293.3 million) on development projects in the holy sites of Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah, all outside Mecca.

Saudi authorities have also taken measures to deal with any epidemics that may break out during the hajj, and have downplayed fears over the spread of a mystery illness from the same family as the deadly SARS virus.
