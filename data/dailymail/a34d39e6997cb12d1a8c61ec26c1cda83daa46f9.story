Silviniaco Conti is poised to try and reclaim the bet365 Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby on Saturday.

The 2012 winner, fourth in the Cheltenham Gold Cup to Lord Windermere, is one of two Paul Nicholls entries alongside Rocky Creek, not seen since finishing a creditable fifth in last season’s Grand National. 

Silviniaco Conti wound up his campaign with victory in the Betfair Bowl at Aintree in the spring and is likely to use Saturday’s feature chase as a springboard to the valuable Betfair Chase at Haydock next month.

Ladbrokes World Hurdle winner More Of That could be the star attraction in the bet365 Hurdle at the same venue.

The exciting six-year-old, who took his unbeaten record to five with victory in the staying showpiece at the Cheltenham Festival, is one of 10 entries and may renew rivalry with At Fishers Cross who was back in third in March.

More Than That has been tipped to perform at the bet365 Hurdle in Wetherby

Newbury, pilloried by many for their decision to rebrand the track as The Racecourse Newbury, has dumped the rather grandiose title.

The track attracted widespread criticism for the decision of joint managing directors Stephen Higgins and Sarah Horden to rename the Berkshire course as part of a strategy which also featured the introduction of an ill-informed dress code.

Higgins and Horden left the racecourse last year and the dress code has since been relaxed, while track officials confirmed yesterday the course would revert to the banner of Newbury Racecourse.
