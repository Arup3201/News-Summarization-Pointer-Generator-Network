Current rules, introduced in 2008, say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks

Shoplifters who ruin small businesses or upset shop staff should be given much tougher punishments, judges and magistrates have been told.

Sentencing advisers yesterday called for jail terms for regular offenders who take goods worth only a few pounds.

Courts should also get tougher with thieves whose crime upsets or distresses small-business owners or staff responsible for running branches of large chains, they said.

New guidelines on how to deal  with thieves also call for stiff new sentencing for those who damage war memorials or put the public in danger by stealing metal.

The demand for more serious sentencing follows complaints from business leaders that theft from stores has been treated as a misdemeanour rather than a crime that can smash small businesses and devastate their staff.

Senior judges have also said police are too readily letting hardened regular offenders get away with minor on-the-spot fines, which regularly go unpaid.

But in 2012 a Cabinet minister said that people who put their rubbish bins out an hour too early should get the same £80 fine as a shoplifter. Rules that apply the same fines to shoplifting and breaking council bin rules remain in force.

The new draft guidelines from the Sentencing Council – the judge-dominated body that advises courts on how to punish criminals – said courts should ‘recognise the impact that shop thefts can have’.

The new sentencing rules – likely to be in operation by the end of the year – ‘emphasise not only loss of business but also take into account that the size or type of business can make the shop owner particularly hard hit by thieves’.

Current rules, introduced in 2008, 
say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks, 
and only for a crime involving violence, very high levels of planning, 
and significant threats or damage. Lesser shoplifting offences attract 
fines or community punishments.

The
 new rules recommend six months in prison for those who steal goods 
worth around £500, if they harm a business or upset a shop worker, and 
even tougher terms for persistent offenders.

As an example, the Sentencing Council said a regular thief who uses a foil-lined bag to steal a DVD box set worth £25 from a supermarket should get three months in jail, even after the court has reduced the punishment for his guilty plea.

Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, welcomes the new draft guidelines

For the first time the rules cover bicycle theft.

Thieves who take machines worth around £250 should go to prison if they cause great inconvenience or leave the victim feeling intimidated, the guidelines say. T

aking metal plaques from a war memorial or crematorium would be punished as ‘heritage’ theft.

The distress to families and the cost of replacing the plaques should mean the culprit is jailed for between  one and four years, the guidelines say.

Those who take manhole covers, roof tiles or electric cables would risk strong penalties because of the dangers and inconvenience they cause the public.

Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium welcomed the new rules.

She said: ‘Theft from stores pushed the direct cost of retail crime up to £511million last year, with the average cost of each theft rising by 62 per cent to £177.'

‘We all pay for this increased stealing through higher prices and, increasingly, shop closures and damage to our town centres.’
