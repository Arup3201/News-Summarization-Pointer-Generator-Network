President Barack Obama is said to have begun quietly backing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren as a potential successor in what would be a snub to his one-time rival and later Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The president has remained publicly mum about who he would back in the 2016 race for the White House, but reportedly he has expressed concern that Ms Clinton - who has long been the unofficial frontrunner for the Democratic nomination - would undo many of his policies.

Senator Warren, a former Harvard law professor and administration aide, could energize the left wing of the Democrat Party more than the centrist Ms Clinton would, in the same way President Obama did in 2008, Edward Klein argues in the New York Post. Warren also helped set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.

Klein, who is the author of author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, wrote that sources told him President Obama has quietly promised Senator Warren his support if she runs and has authorized his chief political adviser, Valerie Jarrett, to convince her to join the race.

Ms Jarrett has held a series of secret meetings with Senator Warren in recent weeks, arguing that she be more likely to carry on President Obama's legacy after he departs the White House.

'Barack, Michelle and Valerie have been talking about Elizabeth Warren for quite some time,' an Obama administration source told Klein. 'Valerie has told Warren that Obama is prepared to throw a great deal of money and organizational support behind her.

'The Obamas believe that Warren sees things from the same ideological point of view as they do. She is a committed progressive who, like Obama, wants to transform America into a European-style democratic-socialist state.'

In interviews, however, Senator Warren has emphatically stated that she has no plans to run for president.

And a 'well-informed Democratic Party operative' Klein talked to 'pooh-poohed' the suggestion that the president was backing Senator Warren.

'It’s all b******t' he said. 'The media is creating a Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren rivalry to hype the storyline. If Warren dared to challenge Hillary, women all over America would never forgive her. She’d lose all her credibility.'

Senator Warren has become a favorite 
among progressives because of her outspoken stances against Wall Street 
and the 'top 1 per cent'.
