When foreign dignitaries spend private time with the Queen, protocol dictates they remain silent about their stay.

Unfortunately that was not the case when New Zealand premier John Key and his family spent a weekend at Balmoral.

No sooner had they left the Scottish retreat, than a picture was  released of Mr Key posing with a casual-looking Queen in her sitting room.

Artworks: Hungarian artist Charles Brocky was commissioned to carry out these portraits of the young Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1841. The artist had arrived in London in 1838 and his chalk portraits were widely admired

He then risked further Royal  displeasure by lifting the lid on his time in the Scottish Highlands.

Once,
 such indiscretions might have caused a diplomatic row, but Buckingham 
Palace was relaxed yesterday about Mr Key’s revelations.

After all, the keen royalist did call Prince George ‘a very bonny baby’.

The picture he released gives a fascinating insight into the personal tastes of the Royal Family.

As
 well as family photos, the Queen’s modest room includes a cheap 
electric heater, a large collection of china dogs, dog beds and, in case
 you had any remaining doubts about her interests, a stuffed corgi toy 
similar to the ones found at the royal gift shops.

Balmoral Castle, located in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, has been 
one of the residences of the British Royal Family since 1852

The room – complete with clashing carpet, rug and cushions – also  features a pot of silk flowers.

Quick to reveal all about his visit, Mr Key said: ‘They were extremely generous hosts and we had a  fantastic weekend.

‘We were invited in as guests in their private family time.’

Prince
 Philip rolled up his sleeves for a barbecue on Friday night, he said, 
and the Queen gave him and his wife a tour in her Land Rover.

‘They
 all pitched in. We helped lay the table. It must be the only bit of 
informality they really have in their lives – it’s definitely an 
informal gathering,’ he said.

His son Max went grouse shooting with Prince William, while his daughter Stephanie hiked with the Duchess of Cambridge.

Even the notoriously snappy royal pets behaved well. ‘The corgis were everywhere. They were very friendly,’ Mr Key said.
