Thirty-eight members of the same family have  paid off mortgages and watched their bank accounts rise after rorting $2 million in welfare payments from the government.

One person from the western Sydney family claimed benefits while depositing $750,000 over three years and another paid off a $300,000 mortgage in just two years while claiming income support.

A third person received rent assistance for a property they already owned.

Multiple people also falsely claimed the disability support pension while other family members claimed a carer's allowance for looking after them. 

The NSW Department of Human Services launched an investigation after a tip-off suggested a man had failed to declare his income. 

As a result, 19 family members have had their welfare payments cancelled and another 19 have had their payments reduced.

Five people have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and nine people have to repay more than $50,000 each.

Human Services Minister, Senator Marise Payne, said it was the most extreme example of rorting she's seen

Human Services Minister, Senator Marise Payne, said she was surprised by the extent of the rorting.

'This is the most extreme example that I've seen in the time I've had this role,' she told Macquarie Radio. 

'People abusing it in this way simply damage the opportunities for the appropriate delivery of payments for others.'

The consequences of such fraud can include prison time, according to Ms Payne.

'This rort was a blatant abuse of the welfare system and an offence to hard-working Australians who expect their taxes to be spent helping those in need,' she said.

Ms Payne admitted there was one family member who had failed to report almost $1 million over 11 years, and her department is working closely with the Australian Tax Office and Australian Federal Police.

'The debts we currently have in relation to social welfare fraud investigations are $39 million,' she said. 

The department's investigation will involve all levels of the alleged fraud including the doctors who may have given documentation to support a disability support pension.

She warned people who are rorting the system that 'we will find you'.
