New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver stopped to sign a sketch of himself in court today as he left the building seemingly unfazed.

Silver, one of the most powerful politicians in the state, was taken into custody around 8am on Thursday and was later charged at Manhattan federal court with taking $4million in bribes disguised as legal fees. He was  released on $200,000 bail.

The 70-year-old Democrat was arrested by the FBI on federal conspiracy and bribery charges that carry up to 100 years in prison and could cost him his political seat.

Silver is a Democrat from Manhattan's Lower East Side and a longtime leader of the Assembly's Democratic majority. The arrest comes just a day after Silver shared the stage with Governor Andrew Cuomo during his State of the State address.

Arrested and charged: Silver, pictured leaving a Manhattan court today, was arrested on bribery and corruption charges on Thursday morning after a long-term investigation by the FBI

'I'm confident that after a full hearing and due process I'll be vindicated on the charges,' said Silver, who seemed unfazed in court, even pausing on his way out to sign a sketch artist's rendering of the scene. He did not enter a plea.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Silver — a lawyer by training — lined up jobs at two firms and then accepted large sums of money in exchange for using his 'titanic' power to do political favors. 

A lot of the money was disguised as 'referral fees,' Bharara said.   

Along with the Senate majority leader and the governor, he plays a major role in creating state budgets, laws and policies in a system long criticized in Albany as 'three men in a room.' He controls, for example, which lawmakers sit on which committees and decides whether a bill gets a vote.

In a measure of his clout, he helped persuade Cuomo last spring to disband a state anti-corruption commission that was investigating Silver's financial dealings and those of his colleagues. Silver had fought the commission's subpoenas and refused to provide information about his outside legal work.

Despite his outsized influence, he is pretty much an unknown outside New York State. Even in Albany, he is one of the most private and least-understood figures, sometimes called 'the Sphinx.'  

Newsday reported the charges stem from an alleged $4million worth of bribes which were handed to Silver over a period of years. 

The paper cited the five-count criminal complaint which accuses Silver of taking more than $3million from a personal injury law firm for referrals from a doctor he gave state contracts. 

He is also accused of earning $700,000 from a real estate law firm which got work from developers he favored. 

'Silver used the power and influence of his official position to obtain for himself millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks masked as legitimate income earned by Silver as private lawyer,' says the complaint.

Silver said he hoped he would be 'vindicated' before entering court and his lawyers said they were 'disappointed' with the 'meritless criminal charges'. They also said the politician expects to be fully exonerated.

Undeclared: A source said the payments in question were substantial and made over several years and Silver failed to list them on his annual financial disclosure filings

The arrest comes just a day after Silver shared the stage with Gov. Andrew Cuomo during his State of the State address

Selected as Assembly speaker in 1994, Silver ranks as the top Democrat in the state Legislature and wields enormous political clout as one of Albany's three principal dealmakers - along with the governor and Senate majority leader - on fiscal matters and major legislation.

He also has long been criticized for his continued employment in one of the state's larger private law practices, which some have said poses a conflict with legislation that would be of interest to his firm, such as medical malpractice or tort reform.

The reported charges pending against Silver would mark the latest case to involve allegations of wrongdoing by state lawmakers in Albany, where at least 30 politicians have faced legal or ethics problems since 2000.

Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat sworn into his second term earlier this month, created an independent anti-corruption commission in 2013 but shut it down this year, prompting an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York who are looking into the panel's unfinished cases.
