Scientists say they have found the first solid archaeological evidence that some of the first permanent British settlers in America survived harsh conditions by resorting to cannibalism.

The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and archaeologists from Jamestown have revealed the bones of a 14-year-old girl they have named Jane with clear signs that she was cannibalized.

The human remains date back to the deadly winter of 1609-1610, known as the 'starving time' in Jamestown, when hundreds of colonists died.

Jamestown was a settlement in the Colony of Virginia, and the first permanent English settlement in the Americas.

It was established by the Virginia 
Company of London as 'James Fort' on May 14, 1607 after several failed 
earlier attempts, and  served as the capital of the colony for 83 years,
 from 1616 until 1699.

Scientists have said the settlers likely arrived during the 
worst drought in 800 years, bringing a severe famine for the 6,000 
people who lived at Jamestown between 1607 and 1625.

For years there have been tales of the starving English settlers 
resorting to eating dogs, mice, snakes and shoe leather at Jamestown, 
the first permanent English settlement in America.

There were also written accounts of settlers eating their own dead, but archaeologists had been skeptical of those stories.

Smithsonian forensic anthropologist 
Douglas Owsley said the human remains date back to a deadly winter known
 as the 'starving time' in Jamestown from 1609 to 1610.

Hundreds of colonists died during the
 period.

The historical record is chilling.

Early Jamestown colony leader George Percy wrote of a 'world of 
miseries,' that included digging up corpses from their graves to eat 
when there was nothing else. 'Nothing was spared to maintain life,' he 
wrote.

In one case, a man killed, 'salted,' and began eating his pregnant wife.

Both Percy and Capt. John Smith, the 
colony's most famous leader, documented the account in their writings. 
The man was later executed.

'One amongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten 
part of her before it was known, for which he was executed, as he well 
deserved,' Smith wrote.

'Now whether she was better roasted, boiled or 
carbonado'd (barbecued), I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife
 I never heard of.'

Archaeologists at Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia were 
somewhat skeptical of the stories of cannibalism in the past because 
there was no solid proof, until now.

'Historians have questioned, well did it happen or not happen?' Owsley 
said.

'And this is very convincing evidence that it did.'

Owsley has been working with William Kelso, the chief archaeologist at Jamestown, since their first burial discovery in 1996.

The remains of the 14-year-old girl discovered in the summer of 2012 
marks the fourth burial of human remains uncovered at Jamestown.

Her 
remains were found in a cellar at the site that had been filled with 
trash, including bones of animals that had been consumed, according to 
archaeologists.

Owsley, who has also done forensic analysis for police investigations, 
analyzed the girl's remains and how the body had been dismembered, 
including chops to the front and back of the head.

The girl was likely 
already dead at the time.

'We call her Jane: female, fourteen years old, possibly from southern England,' the researchers say.

They believe she left Plymouth, England, in June 1609 as part of the largest fleet yet to sail for Jamestown.

But a terrifying hurricane scattered the fleet, and her ship limped into Jamestown in early August.

Less than a year later, she was dead.

remains were found in a cellar at the site that had been filled with

The human remains will be placed on 
display at Jamestown to explain the 'starving time' and the horrid 
conditions early settlers faced.

At the 
Smithsonian, curators will display a digital reconstruction of the 
girl's face to explain the discovery in an exhibit about life at 
Jamestown.

The reconstruction of the female Jamestown colonist was based on a CT scan that allowed a digital reconstructing of her splintered cranium.

That digital image then became a 3D model of the skull that Ivan Schwartz and his team at StudioEIS in New York used to create a likeness of her facial features through sculpting and painting.

There was a cultural stigma against killing 
someone for food, Owsley said.

But it was clear to him immediately that there were signs of cannibalism.

'It is the evidence found on those bones that put it within the context 
of this time period," he said.

'This does represent a clear case of 
dismemberment of the body and removing of tissues for consumption.'

It was the work of someone not skilled at butchering, Owsley said.

There was a sense of desperation.

The bones show a bizarre attempt to open the skull.

Animal brains and 
facial tissue would be considered accepted and desirable meat in the 
17th century, Owsley said.

The Smithsonian and Jamestown archaeologists are also publishing their 
findings in a book but decided against waiting to announce the discovery
 through a peer-reviewed journal.

Owsley said archaeology is helping to fill in details from a time when 
few records were kept - details that won't likely be found in history 
books.

'It provides a more personal glimpse into the lives and events that 
these people experienced,' he said.

'When you're dealing with 17th 
century sites like Jamestown, I think it really enhances what we know 
about these people.'
