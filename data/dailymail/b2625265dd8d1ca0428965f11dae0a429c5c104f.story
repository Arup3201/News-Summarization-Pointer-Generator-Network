A two-year-old boy allegedly abducted by his parents and taken to Malaysia has been returned to Adelaide.

A South Australia Department for Education and Child Development (DECD) spokesman said the toddler is now in the care of Families SA.

The boy was under the guardianship of the Minister for Education and Child Development, but lived with his grandparents.

He was returned to Adelaide on a Malaysia Airlines flight early on Sunday in the company of two Families SA social workers and has undergone a routine health check, the spokesman said.

A South Australian couple have been arrested in Malaysia after kidnapping their two-year-old son and fleeing the country last weekend, Chief Superintendent John Venditto revealed

Police on Friday said the parents, aged 26 and 23, were arrested by Malaysian authorities on Thursday and have been charged with the aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction.

The grandparents, aged 64 and 52, have been charged with aiding and abetting the parents.

In accordance with South Australian law, the offence could see them sentenced to a prison term of up to 19 years.

Australian police have also charged the child's 64-year-old grandfather and 52-year-old grandmother' with aiding and abetting in the unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction', according to a police statement.

The grandparents failed to notify authorities, for more than 24 hours, that the two-year-old had left their care.

It has also been alleged that they 'handed the boy over to his parents on Saturday August 2'.

Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' at the time he was taken.

Chief Superintendent John Venditto said at a press conference that the entire operation took only six days from the moment police were informed that the child was missing until the arrest of his parents.

'It is an extraordinarily quick and rapid response to something that would generally take a lot longer,' he said.

Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, the officer in charge of the investigation, said the child's well-being was the priority throughout the operation.

'This was an incredibly delicate investigation and we were mindful that the parents could flee at any moment with the boy to an unknown location,' he said.

The parents could face up to 19 years in jail according to South Australian law, while the grandparents, who  have also been charged, are expected to appear at the Holden Hill Magistrates court (pictured) in October

'Such a quick and positive outcome could not have been achieved without the cooperation of a number national and international agencies, including Interpol, the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Government, Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department, Department of Foreign Affairs, South Australia DPP and the Australian Federal Police,' he said.

The parents have so far appeared at a Malaysian court and will now be remanded for the customary 60 days until the case will resume.

Australian authorities are awaiting for decisions surrounding their extradition and any further charges to be decided by Malaysian authorities.

Meanwhile, the toddler's grandparents have been granted bail and are set to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on 14 October. Their charges could also lead to a lengthy jail sentence, according to police.
