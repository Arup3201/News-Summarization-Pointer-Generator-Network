This was the shocking sight that greeted marketing executive  Jessica Sawyer when she returned to collect her £80,000 Bentley from a car wash.

The black convertible should have been gleaming in the sunshine. Instead the bodywork was riven with dents, scratches and cracks after the car was crashed into a wall at Wash And Shine in Cheetham Hill, Manchester.

Miss Sawyer said: ‘Fifteen minutes after I handed over the keys I got a call from the police telling me the car was in the side of the car wash. When I saw it I just started crying.’

Damage: Jessica Sawyer left her Bentley at the car wash but returned to find it in this state

Collision: Part of the car wash building was also destroyed when the vehicle was driven into it

She was given the car as a 30th 
birthday present last December by her mother, who is the boss of the 
family telecommunications firm. Miss Sawyer said her insurers had paid 
the £48,000 cost of replacing the bodywork.

Police told her the car wash driver 
may have mistaken the accelerator for the brake on the automatic, but he
 fled after the crash and has not been seen since. The wash owner said 
he was not in charge at the time of the crash.

Ms Sawyer, an advertising and marketing manager who lives in Bramhall, Stockport, is still waiting for repairs to be completed on her car after the vehicle's entire bodywork had to be replaced.

She said: 'When I got to the car wash
 that day I handed over my keys to the man washing the car in front of 
mine and said I would be back in an hour.

'But 15 minutes later I got a call from the police telling me the car was in the side of the car wash.

'I went back and when I saw it I was so upset I just started crying, then I got angry.

'The police officer there told me he thought the guy I'd given my keys to had mistaken the accelerator for the brake because it's an automatic and he'd seen it happen before.

'There was no engine damage but all the bodywork was damaged.'

Her insurance company have also now had to take legal action against the car wash, after the owner claimed the man who drove it was not an employee.

Work needed: The collision left the vehicle's bodywork completely wrecked to the tune of £48,000

Ms Sawyer said: 'The insurance company have been amazing and have paid out - but the owner of the car wash has refused to admit responsibility. Now they are having to take legal action against them.

'The whole thing is so upsetting and disappointing and I want other people to know what has happened because I think they should take responsibility for what has happened.'

When contacted the current owner of the car wash said he was not in charge at the time of the accident and said he had only taken over the business four weeks ago. He declined to comment further.

A police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the car wash on the day of the incident, by the business owner.

'The incident is now being treated as a civil matter between the car owner and car wash owner due to the many inconsistencies between the two accounts of what happened.'
