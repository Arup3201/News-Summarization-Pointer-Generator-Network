Shaun Bailey has been moved to a position in the Cabinet Office after losing his job as a special adviser before a number of former public school pupils were appointed at Downing Street

The only black working class adviser to David Cameron has alleged he has been pushed out of Downing Street by an Old Etonian 'clique'.

Shaun Bailey has been moved to a 'non-position' in the Cabinet Office after losing his job as the Prime Minister's special adviser for youth and crime before a number of former public school pupils were appointed, it has been reported.

Mr Bailey last night insisted on Twitter that he was 'very happy' with his move to the Cabinet Office.

But according to a report in the The Telegraph, he has told friends he was not allowed into Downing Street's inner circle because he was 'different'.

According to the report, Mr Bailey, who ran to be an MP in the London constituency of Hammersmith in the 2010 election, had privately told of his frustration that his concerns about the party's lack of appeal in black, working class communities had not been listened to.

A friend of Mr Bailey told the paper: 'They just didn't get what Shaun was saying.'

The source said he warned the party needed to show it was diverse, if it wanted to be able to say it was.

The friend said: 'Shaun always says that you can see from space that the place is dominated by those from Eton.'

The father-of-two, who is in his early 40s, is understood to still hope to become a Conservative MP.

He was seen as a rising star when he was picked by the Tories to run against Labour MP Andy Slaughter in Hammersmith in 2007, and only narrowly lost out.

Despite the defeat, Mr Bailey, who grew up in north Kensington, west London, was later appointed Mr Cameron's 'Big Society Ambassador' before moving onto his role as special adviser for youth and crime, an area in which he has great experience.

Mr Bailey, who narrowly lost out in his bid to become Conservative MP for Hammersmith in 2010, was once thought of as one of David Cameron's favourite young politicians

A youth worker for more than 20 years, Mr Bailey first worked as a drugs councillor before co-founding his own charity, My Generation, which focuses on social problems among the young.

Shaun
 Bailey has long been spoken of in the higher echelons of Downing Street
 as a future political star, and has even been mooted as a future Home 
Secretary or Mayor of London.

He grew up in west London, becoming
 a security guard at Wembley and the Trocadero centre in order
 to fund his degree in computer aided technology at South Bank 
University.

But Mr Bailey, a former army cadet and 
keen gymnast, made his mark as a youth worker, helping drug addicts before setting up his own charity, My Generation, 
which helps young people with social problems.

In 2007 he was selected as the 
Conservative party candidate to fight for a seat at the 2010 elections 
in the constituency of Hammersmith, but he narrowly lost out to Labour MP Andy Slaughter.

Despite the defeat, he had made his mark with Number 10, pioneering ideas on youth crime and breaking Britain's dependency culture.

He was selected as Mr Cameron's Big
 Society Ambassador in 2011 and later as the Prime Minister's special 
adviser on youth and crime.

His removal from the role puts question marks over his ambition to again stand as an MP for the 2015 elections.

Mr Bailey was paid £60,000 to advise Mr Cameron but he was moved to the Cabinet Office in January.

He is believed to now be earning £36,000 a year and is on a one year contract.

Mr Bailey last night wrote on Twitter: 'Very happy with my move to the Cabinet Office. The PM's office have treated me well.'

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 
'Shaun Bailey is undertaking a part-time role with the Office for Civil 
Society as the Government's Communities and Youth Engagement Champion.

'His
 experience and background, which include working as the PM's adviser on
 Youth and Crime mean he is well placed to advise on the Government's 
initiatives for young people in their communities.'

A
 Downing Street source told The Telegraph: 'Shaun was a highly valued 
member of the No 10 team, and he is continuing that good work at the 
Cabinet Office.'

Last month, the Daily Mail reported 
how David Cameron had been urged to undergo anti-sexism training to help
 boost the number of women in Government.

Tory MP Therese Coffey revealed
 she was encouraging the Prime Minister to undergo so-called 
‘unconscious bias’ training in a bid to help make both the Government 
and the Conservative Party more diverse.

Mr
 Cameron has been accused of displaying schoolboy sexism towards female 
MPs in the Commons – once telling shadow Treasury chief secretary Angela
 Eagle to ‘calm down dear’, and, on another occasion, joking that 
maverick Tory Nadine Dorries was ‘extremely frustrated’.
