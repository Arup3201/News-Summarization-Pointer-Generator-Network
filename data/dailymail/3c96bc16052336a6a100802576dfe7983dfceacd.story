By Sunday evening, Abu Dhabi time, Formula One will have a new champion. Whether it will have a credible future is another matter entirely.

Ideally, Lewis Hamilton will have driven first, or second, through the flag at the Yas Marina circuit just moments before. If Hamilton finishes top two — as he has done in the last six races — order will reign and the integrity of the event will be maintained. If Hamilton finishes lower — or worst-case scenario, not at all — a sport already beleaguered by courtroom battles and economic crisis will plunge towards its greatest controversy yet.

Fans will tolerate financial scandal, and complex legal battles leave them cold. Fair play is a different matter. On occasions when Formula One has attracted greatest negativity, a miscarriage of justice, an assault on basic fairness, has invariably been responsible.

Nelson Piquet Jnr crashed deliberately at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to trigger the safety car and a win for his Renault team-mate Fernando Alonso; Rubens Barrichello was told to let Ferrari team-mate and No 1 driver Michael Schumacher pass to win the Austrian Grand Prix in 2002.

One act was close to fraudulent — but neither sat well with the public.

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

Motor sport, we are told, is a team game, and Ferrari’s desire to keep Schumacher on top was no different in essence to a football manager picking one player and dropping another for a big match. Yet something about the instruction struck at the heart of ethical racing and team orders that directly influenced race positions were subsequently outlawed.

If anything, Sunday’s grand finale represents an even greater threat to the status of Formula One. This time it is not an individual race that may be artificially adjusted but an entire season. There is a chance that Hamilton — who has 10 wins in 2014, double that of any rival prior to Abu Dhabi — might not claim the drivers’ championship. The reason? Last race double points. For one day only, 25 first-place points become 50, 18 second place points hike to 36.

You get the idea. No decision on next year has been announced, but the practice is almost certain to be abandoned after this single season experiment. Like all bad ideas, double points is an orphan.

Nobody is willing to take responsibility for it; nobody claims to have brought it into the world. It was born, and will die, in this season.

With luck it will not take the reputation of the sport with it.

‘Double the points, double the action,’ is the sell here, but only half of that claim is true. Abu Dhabi has double points, but the action is just the same. It is not as if the drivers go around twice for their bonus.

If they did, it might make sense. As it is, double points is a rule change designed to thwart a man whose time was up anyway.

Sebastian Vettel was dominating the sport when it was first mooted. Bizarrely, this success was presumed to continue and double points was considered a way of slowing his procession while creating the potential for intrigue on the last day. 

It was hasty and an over-reaction. Vettel is a distant fourth this year. He is so out of contention he is quitting Red Bull for Ferrari in time for 2015. The F1 bonus round is therefore akin to the Premier League changing the points system to put the brakes on Manchester United — and introducing the measure to coincide with the arrival of David Moyes.

Grand prix racing has always had a cavalier approach to scoring. 

Relations between the pair have been strained this season due to a number of racing incidents

It was not so long ago that teams were allowed to discount their worst race in the first half of the season.

There also used to be smaller margins, as little as two points, between first and second.

Bernie Ecclestone claims his initial idea for double points involved three races carrying the incentive, not one, which would make more sense. Bonus points for marquee events — the last race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix and one other (Silverstone or Monza if influenced by history, Spa or Suzuka if judged on the test, Singapore for the spectacle, Bahrain or Sochi if Bernie just farmed it out to the highest bidder) — would not be a calamity. 

After all, not all tennis and golf tournaments are created equal, with bigger prize-money and prestige attached to events that bring the greatest pressure and athletic challenge.

Had there been three occasions this season when Formula One had recognised a test of increased significance, this might have been hailed as a visionary move.

Instead, it looked like another Ecclestone-inspired gimmick.

Sport does not always have to be fair. Indeed, one of its challenges is the way an individual or team reacts to the adversity of an official’s lousy decision, a run of injuries or a technical failure. Yet it cannot be wantonly unjust. And if Hamilton — without doubt the driver of the season — ends up trailing his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by some final-race fluke, it will be regarded as one of sport’s great travesties.

Maybe this accounted for the tension in the room as the men sat on the top tier for Thursday’s pre-race press conference. They were separated by Nico Hulkenberg of Force India and looked straight ahead, barely acknowledging each other save for a forced handshake for photographers. Rosberg initiated it, Hamilton responded, with barely a flicker of recognition.

The interviews had been going roughly 23 minutes before he allowed even a half-smile. Asked about driver etiquette with so much at stake, Hamilton’s replies were clipped and the sentiments pointed.

If Hamilton took Rosberg out at the first corner, the title would be his. He insisted he was not that type of driver; Rosberg hardly offered confirmation of this statement.

Even without double points, the motivation for Hamilton to fight dirty would not change — yet the warped scoring system has given the whole event an unreal air. After 17 races, here comes a leap into the unknown. And Formula One could do without another scandal. It occupies an awkward position in the modern psyche as it is — such conspicuous consumption against the backdrop of global recession.

The Yas Marina complex is a billionaire’s playground. Yachts bob in the harbour, the five-star hotel straddling the circuit is a design classic, the work of Hani Rashid and Lisa Anne Couture of Asymptote Architecture in New York. Meanwhile, in what resembled a deserted lot at the end of the paddock, the crowd-funded Caterham team announced the recruitment of Will Stevens, a 23-year-old making his F1 debut in this final race.

Caterham entered administration in October and the man now in charge, Finbarr O’Connell, said they had come to Abu Dhabi only as a showcase for potential buyers. It is an irony that those at the far end of the leaderboard fight to be noticed.

Despite the predicted double action, what Formula One could most do with this weekend is no alarms, no surprises and the natural order maintained.
