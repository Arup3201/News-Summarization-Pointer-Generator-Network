The news of Mesut Ozil's injury has worsened Arsenal's injury crisis in midfield as they push for silverware this season. The German international has been ruled out until the start of next year with a knee injury, joining fellow midfielders Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey on the treatment table. With the Gunners' injury crisis mounting we asked Arsenal fan site Gooner Talk who Arsene Wenger should sign in January to add depth and quality to the FA Cup holders' midfield.

Arsenal's depleted midfield is in desperate need of a new addition following the news that Mesut Ozil has been ruled out until early 2015.

Huge amounts of pressure have been heaped on the likes of Jack Wilshere, a player who himself has found himself on the treatment table for over 20 months in the last three years.

Fellow midfield stars Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky will also need to manage their own injury problems and maintain a level of consistency if the club are to mount a genuine challenge for trophies this season.

But who will be Arsenal's missing piece in the jigsaw when the January transfer window reopens? Paris Saint-Germain's pass master Yohan Cabaye is the man Arsene Wenger should sign.

28-year-old Cabaye isn't a 'man mountain' or 'Vieira type' player that all the pundits suggest Arsenal need, but he does bring a mix of defensive and attacking qualities which are missing from the current squad.

He was the subject of a £12million bid from Arsenal the summer before he moved to the Parc des Princes from Newcastle in January. The France international admitted his frustration earlier in the week at not being given regular game time by boss Laurent Blanc.

'Am I completely happy? To be honest, no.', admitted Cabaye.

'It is a new situation for me, but I don't complain. It is the first time I haven't played regularly for my club.

'Do I sometimes miss England? Yes. Sometimes I think about it, but I immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction.'

Wenger is a known admirer of Cabaye's abilities and there are several reasons why he should consider launching a loan bid for the midfielder in January.

Cabaye is a versatile, deep-lying playmaker able to orchestrate attacks from deep positions and he would be perfect player to breach opposition defences while the injured Ozil is on the sidelines.

A potential loan deal would suit both clubs down to the ground and with Cabaye being cup tied in the Champions League, all of his focus would be on the Premier League, where he played 79 times in two-and-a-half seasons for Newcastle.

When Arsenal played Newcastle at St James' last season, Cabaye was one of the best players on the pitch, posing problems for the Gunners' defence with his accurate set-pieces and long-range efforts towards goal.

And Wenger's side, who have scored just 14 times in four seasons from corners, need a player like Cabaye who can deliver pin-point passes, break up play and spread the play for forwards Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sanchez.

Cabaye, who racked up two assists and six goals for Newcastle in his final six months at St James' Park, would provide much-needed tenacity, creativity and experience in an injury-plagued squad which is in desperate need of quality players.
