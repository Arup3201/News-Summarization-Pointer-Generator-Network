Neil Skipper, 30, told his parents he would be back for tea before going to Putney station and falling in front of a high-speed train, an inquest heard

A man told his parents he was going out and would be back for dinner before falling in front of a high-speed train and fatally injuring himself.

Neil Skipper, 30, had received an aggressive spam email before he wrote a note saying 'Sorry mum and dad' and left his home in Thornton Heath, south London, for the last time, an inquest heard.

The business support officer for Croydon Council died from multiple injuries after he was hit by the train at Putney station, south west London, on June 1 last year.

His parents became concerned when he didn’t return home, and searched his bedroom, finding the note by his computer.

When they turned it on they found a rogue, threatening email he’d received from a spam address.

The matter was being investigated further by police, the inquest heard, though contents of the email were not disclosed.

Coroner Dr William Dolman reached an open verdict at Westminster Coroner’s Court after ruling out suicide.

The inquest heard how Mr Skipper left home and travelled on the bus, train and tube before arriving at Putney station, where he stepped in front of a train.  He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Skipper, a Fulham Football Club season ticket holder, had no history of mental illness and was an intelligent and logical thinker, it was reported.

His GP, Dr Simon Ramsbotham, said he had obsessive interests in trains and dinosaurs which might point to Asperger syndrome.

He said it would explain his drastic reaction to what he saw on his computer.

Mr Skipper's father, Philip, said after the tragedy that his son would always be loved and always be missed.

In a statement read to the court by Dr Dolman, he said: 'Neil was a clever person and after studying for a journalism degree he started working for Croydon Council in 2007 where he had many friends.

'He was family orientated, and was working with his granddad to write memoirs from his experiences in the war.

'He said he would be back in time for tea but he did not return.'
