Verizon and Comcast customers are struggling to use Netflix because their connection has become too slow, it has been claimed.

Customers have taken to online forums to say the service in unusable for them, and claiming the firms may be prioritising their own streaming services.

Netflix revealed the providers have slipped down its ISP rankings - despite their claims to offer high speed services.

Comcast and Verizon customers have taken to online forums to complain Netflix has become unusable for them

There are 44 million Netflix members worldwide.

Over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies are streamed from Netflix each month.

During peak watching times, Netflix accounts for around a third of all downstream Internet traffic in the U.S.

Comcast ranked among the slowest on the list, while Verizon FIOS dropped one spot, to seventh of 17, according to a Netflix analysis of data culled from its millions of subscribers.

'The Netflix ISP Speed Index is based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month,' wrote Joris Evers of Netflix.

'The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP's network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network.

'A faster network generally means a better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions.'

However, consumers say speed is a major issue.

One Verizon customer wrote in January that Netflix had become 'pretty much unusable' over the previous month.

'During a movie or show, it will stop for buffering every minute or two and hang for about 30 seconds, then resume, then repeat.

'I am currently suspicious that Verizon has put in place new network policies that corrupt the Netflix streams since they have a competing service.Â 

'Or, they just don't care about providing the level of service I am paying for.'

A frustrated Comcast customer in Washington said 'Daytime is fine but the evenings suck bad.'

Netflix speeds on both Verizon FiOS and Comcast, which have 6.1 million and 20.7 million respective subscribers, have been slowing for the past few months, according to the Netflix figures.

The complaints come after last month's federal appeals court ruling that struck down Federal Communication Commission rules known as net neutrality.

An ISP like Verizon or Comcast could charge a company like YouTube, Netflix or Facebook to deliver content faster to subscribers.

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has spoken out about the move, telling investors: 'The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation.

'Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some [Internet service provider], we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver.'

However, Verizon told HuffPo ts treats all traffic equally.

During peak watching times, Netflix accounts for around a third of all downstream Internet traffic in the U.S., according to Sandvine, a company that monitors networks.

Netflix said Verizon is not slowing its traffic, and the streaming video company isn't concerned with the possibility that ISPs may throttle its service, according to an article on Re/Code.

Some experts believe the problem is with network capacity, and the huge popularity of online streaming services.
