The college friend of John Grisham who inspired the author to claim American men are wrongly being sent to prison for watching child porn - sparking international outrage - was caught sharing sexually explicit images of girls younger than 12 with other internet users, it has emerged.

Michael B. Holleman, 59 - who graduated from law at the University of Mississippi with Grisham in 1981 - was arrested in 1997 after sending 13 child porn images featuring girls under 18 - some younger than 12 and depicting intercourse - to an undercover agent in Canada, who then tipped off the FBI.

Grisham came under fire this week after saying in an interview that the US judicial system was 'crazy' for putting '60-year-old white men in prison who've never harmed anybody' but have viewed images or videos of children being sexually abused.

The prolific novelist was defending an 'old buddy from law school' who, he said, drunkenly accessed pornography featuring '16-year-olds' one night and was caught in an FBI sting operation.

Under fire: Author John Grisham, who sparked international outrage this week for saying men who watch child porn are sentenced too harshly, was defending a Mississippi friend caught on serious charges

That man has now been named as Michael Holleman - a father who still practices law in Mississippi - by The Telegraph, to whom Grisham first gave his controversial comments.

The newspaper cited 'unseen' reports of Holleman's 1997 trial and quoted a US justice department lawyer, Kathy McLure.

Prosecutors said Holleman may have faced additional of transmitting pornographic images to Maine, suggesting he had sent the porn to other people, if he hadn't pleaded guilty.

Holleman was sentenced to 18 months in prison and disbarred after pleading guilty to one count of possession of child pornography.

He claimed that he had been drinking heavily at his legal office when he accessed some 'publicly available computer images of child pornography on the internet'.

Holleman thought he had deleted them from his computer and did not print them off, according to a petition to reinstate Holleman to practice law.

However they were still on his hard drive after he was presented with a search warrant as part of the FBI investigation.

Holleman had a three-year-old son at the time.

His marriage fell apart as a result, according to the petition.

Following his arrest, Holleman checked himself into COPAC, a renowned addictions treatment facility in Brandon, Mississippi, and also attended Alcoholics Anonymous.

On May 19, 1998, Holleman reported to a federal correctional institution, but was released after 15 months after showing evidence of his rehabilitation.

As part of his sentence, Holleman was not allowed to practice law for at least three years.

Grisham wrote a letter of recommendation for Holleman so that be could be reinstated to the bar in 2002, Jezebel reported.

Holleman was eventually reinstated and is currently practicing law in Mississippi.

 

Many fans had already taken to social media to announce they would never buy Grisham's books again following the outlandish comments, especially since he made them while promoting his latest tome, Gray Mountain.

'Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure, or who in any way participates in child pornography—online or otherwise—should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,' Grisham said in a statement today.

'My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children.

'I can think of nothing more despicable. I regret having made these comments, and apologize to all.'

In the original interview with The Telegraph, Grisham explained described his friend's situation: 'His drinking was out of control, and he went to a website. It was labelled ''sixteen-year-old wannabee hookers'' or something like that. 

'So he went there. Downloaded some stuff - it was 16-year-old girls who looked 30.

'He shouldn't have done it. It was stupid, but it wasn't 10-year-old boys.

Online reaction: Many 0commented that Grisham's claims don't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography

Outrage: Fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by John Grisham, who is currently promoting his latest book, legal thriller Gray Mountain, which will be released next week  

'He didn't touch anything.

'And God, a week later there was a knock on the door: ''FBI!'' and it was sting set up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to catch people - sex offenders - and he went to prison for three years.'

'There's so many of them now. There's so many ''sex offenders'' - that's what they're called - that they put them in the same prison.

'Like they're a bunch of perverts, or something.

'We've gone nuts with this incarceration.'

Grisham was sure to say that he has 'no sympathy for real pedophiles' and believes anyone caught committing such a crime should face harsh penalties.

However he believes many men have been penalized too harshly for doing too little.

Many readers immediately went online to criticize the author's stance.

'After being a firm favorite of mine for over 20 years, Mr Grisham, I can state with all certainty that I will never purchase another book of yours ever again,' Karen Hanna wrote online, according to stuff.co.nz.

'I am absolutely disgusted at the stance you have taken over child pornography and have lost all respect for you.'

Another fan, Bernadine Denham wrote: 'So watching child porn isn't an offence? What a disgusting thing to say. You've lost me.'

Grisham is a married father-of-two.

He and his wife, Renee Jones, were wed in 1981.

They split their time between homes in Oxford, Mississippi, and a Charlottesville, Virginia.
