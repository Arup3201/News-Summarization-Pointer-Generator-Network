Tough new language checks for European doctors are to come into force from this summer.

It comes as nine out of 10 patients and health workers backed the idea of striking off doctors who refuse to learn English.

The
 General Medical Council will also be able to force doctors from the 
European Union to take language tests if there are concerns about their 
ability to communicate with their patients.

Doctors from the European Union will face new language tests to ensure patients are protected

Under existing rules, the GMC can only test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the EU.

Since 1983 it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states.

There are more than 27,000 doctors from the EEA working in the UK, none of whom have ever been tested for their English skills.

Under
 a GMC consultation which has just closed,  there will be a new category
 in fitness to practise cases in which a doctor can be found ‘impaired 
because he or she does not have the necessary knowledge of English’.

There will also be a new power to force
 doctors to undergo an English language test if a ‘relevant, serious 
complaint is made about them’.

The
 GMC will also have the power to ‘indefinitely suspend doctors who don’t
 develop sufficient English language skills to treat patients safely’.

Niall
 Dickson, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: ‘Doctors who want to 
practise in the UK must be able to communicate effectively in English to
 ensure the safety of their patients.

‘These
 new measures to ensure doctors from other European countries can 
communicate in English, combined with the higher test score 
requirements, will help us strengthen protection for patients. They will
 also bring about a greater degree of fairness between our requirements 
for European doctors and for those from outside Europe.’

Lethal dose: German Dr Daniel Ubani killed a patient after confusing two different drugs

In
 2008 German Dr Daniel Urbani killed Cambridge patient David Gray when 
he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of 
diamorphine.

Health minister Dan Poulter said: ‘Overseas doctors make a valuable contribution to the national health service.

‘However,
 it is vital that all doctors practising in the United Kingdom have the 
necessary language skills to help ensure patient safety and quality of 
care.’

He insisted that 
individual NHS organisations are responsible for ‘ensuring that the 
people they employ have the required knowledge and skills, including 
language competency, for the posts for which they are applying’.

An alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 after patients complained that they had received poor treatment from doctors who had a poor grasp of the English language.

In an attempt to tackle the problem, in September the Government proposed introducing language tests specifically for doctors arriving from EU countries in what would amount to a change to EU law.

In a public consultation on the issue, nine out of 10 respondents agreed that the GMC should have the power to require a doctor to undergo a language assessment when there is a serious concern about their knowledge of English, and that the GMC should not grant a licence to practise to European doctors who are unable or unwilling to show they have the necessary knowledge of English.

Eight out of 10 respondents felt that that the GMC should indefinitely suspend doctors who fail to acquire the necessary knowledge of English to treat patients in the UK safely.

Under the Government's plans, the GMC would not be given the right to automatically test all EU doctors, but it would be able to carry out tests if concerns were raised when they registered to work.

Inspectors can check competency when looking at qualifications, how long doctors have been registered in other countries and what experience they have.

Red flags might include doctors turning up with interpreters, poor English in interviews or poor written English on application forms.

Any worries could then prompt full testing of the doctor's language skills.

The new plans would also allow the GMC to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness-to-practise investigation.

At present, the GMC has no powers to carry out such checks during its hearings.

Doctors from overseas wanting 
to practise in UK will need to achieve score of 7.5 out of 9 in the 
International English Language Testing System test

If they fail to meet these requirements, they could be struck off
