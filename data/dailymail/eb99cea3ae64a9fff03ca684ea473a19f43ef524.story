Extradited: British soldier David McIntyre, 43, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, has lost his appeal fighting extradition to the US

A British soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder has lost his legal challenge against extradition to the US where he is wanted on fraud charges.

David McIntyre, 43, who served in Afghanistan, was given additional time by Home Secretary Theresa May to present evidence of his illness to London's High Court in a bid to stand trial in Britain.

But despite being 'at high risk of suicide', he was today told the medical notes were not enough to block his removal.

In an irreversible ruling, Mr McIntyre, who also served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Iraq, now faces eight counts of fraud and a possible 20-year jail term in an American prison.

The fraud case concerns a contract between Mr McIntyre's security firm Quantam Risk and the US Institute of Peace.

It is alleged that McIntyre 
overcharged the institute by $100,000 (£66,000) when providing security for the group in Iraq during a break from army service.

The former soldier insists he is innocent and is the victim of a plea bargain in which a US official, accused of similar offences, named him to secure a lenient sentence.

Mr McIntyre, from Manchester, served with the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment from 1996 to 2002.

When he left, he set up his company to provide security to American clients, including the Iraqi ambassador to the US.

But in 2009 he closed the business and enrolled in the Royal Military Police Territorial Army.

He was serving in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, when the allegations emerged in July 2012, forcing him to be discharged and flown home.

Despite two years of legal battles, and a military psychiatric report warning extradition could have 'potentially tragic' consequences, he has now been told he will be sent to the US.

And Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas 
said there was 'no conceivable basis' on which he could appeal this 
latest ruling in the Supreme Court.

Blasting the sentence as 'cruel', Friends Extradited spokesman Melanie Riley told MailOnline:

Ruling: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas ruled there was 'no injustice' in the case at London's High Court

'David is somebody who has served his country all of his life and as a result of what he has seen is suffering from PTSD.

'I think it is cruel and unnecessary to extradite him.

'We
 have the facilities to investigate the alleged overcharging of £66,000 
without putting him through the added trauma of automatically locking 
him up, separating him from his partner, his kids, his home.

'I am also not persuaded that the US justice system takes sufficient care of people with mental health problems.'

'David has served his country all his life. It is cruel and unnecessary to put him through the trauma of separating him from his partner, kids, and home'

At
 the March hearing, Edward Fitzgerald QC, for McIntyre, argued there was
 convincing medical evidence that he was suffering from a mental 
disorder and it would violate his human rights if extradition went ahead
 because of the suicide risk.

He suggested McIntyre could stand trial in the UK. The US authorities opposed the bid to block removal.

McIntyre’s supporters say of the extradition threat: 'Is this really the way Britain should be treating its brave soldiers?'

The ex-soldier has said in an online blog: 'If I was given an order to be extradited to the US I am fearful that I would take my own life as I would rather be dead then be locked up in an American prison away from my family and knowing that everything that I had been working towards would have been taken away from me.

'I think, after serving my country all my life, the least I can expect is to be helped with my PTSD and being allowed to prove my innocence in my own country.'

But the judges said they were satisfied there was no 'injustice' in the case.
