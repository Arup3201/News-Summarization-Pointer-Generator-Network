Bernie Madoff's last surviving son, who died last week, left his $16 million fortune to both his estranged wife and his newer fiancee, Manhattan court documents revealed Thursday.

The will of Andrew Madoff, who succumbed to cancer last Wednesday, provides that his legal wife Deborah West will get one third of his assets while Caroline Hooper--whom he described as a 'fiancee'--will get $50,000 per month through a trust.

The 48-year-old financier also provided trusts for his two children, who'll also receive all Madoff's personal property.

Revealed: The late Andrew Madoff left his fiancee Catherine Hooper a trust of $50,000 per month in the Bernie Madoff's son's will revealed Thursday

Everyone gets a piece: Andrew Madoff's estranged wife Deborah West (right) was left one-third of the millionaire financier's estate. Their children, including daughter Emily Madoff (left) will receive trusts and all of Madoff's personal property

'I request my executor to pay to Catherine Hooper, so long as she is living, the sum of $50,000 on the first day of each month, commencing 30 days after the admission of this will to probate, for her support until the administration of my estate is completed,' reads the July 8 will, obtained by the New York Daily News.

For those who know the back-story between Madoff and his wife West, her inclusion in the will may come as a surprise.

West, the mother of Madoff's children and his wife at the time for around 16 years, filed for divorce the same day her father-in-law was arrested in December 2008. 

Hooper moved in with Andy just three days after the senior Madoff's arrest.

It was all too much: Andrew Madoff suffered from multiple bouts with a rare lymphoma and after an initial remission, he would blame his father for the cancer's return

Andrew Madoff and his brother, Mark Madoff, worked on the legitimate trading side of their father's Manhattan firm, two floors removed from the private investment business where Bernard Madoff carried out his $65 billion Ponzi scheme over several decades.

Bernard Madoff, 76, was arrested in December 2008. He pleaded guilty to fraud charges months later and is serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. Two years after the father's arrest, Mark Madoff hanged himself in his Manhattan loft apartment as his 2-year-old son slept in another room.

'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew Madoff told People magazine last year. 'And it's killing me slowly.'

Andrew Madoff was diagnosed with the rare form of cancer in 2003 but went into remission. He blamed the relapse on the stress of living with his father's scam. The disease returned in October 2012, and he told People magazine he felt 'blindsided.'

Andrew Madoff had served as the chairman of the Lymphoma Research Foundation's board of directors until his father's scheme was revealed.

Flumenbaum said Andrew Madoff had 'lost his courageous battle' with the disease. He said funeral arrangements will be private.

The death came as authorities continue to investigate what role, if any, close family members and others linked to the Madoff business had in the fraud. Sentencings are scheduled in several weeks for five former high-level Madoff firm employees convicted of helping carry out the fraud by conspiring to defraud clients and falsifying books and records.

While heading up Madoff Energy, an entity of his father's firm, Andy shared in more than $31 million in so-called 'loans' doled out to family members by his crooked father, seemingly another effort to hide the billions looted from trusting investors.

As a veteran of the Madoff firm told me for my 2009 book, the family had 'so much money coming in and out of their accounts they needed five people to keep track of it. There was a Disneyland atmosphere. Money meant nothing to the Madoffs.'

Carolina Hooper was once a covergirl for Fish & Fly magazine. She moved in with Andrew Madoff just days after his wife announced her plans to divorce Madoff

The Madoff veteran recalled the bonuses and gifts that were doled out around the holidays by.Andy's always coiffed and catered to mother, Ruth. 'We used to call it 'Ruth's Twelve Days of Christmas.' Beginning in the early '90s she'd spend at least $150,000 a day, give or take, during the holidays, buying gifts and who knows what else.'

When Bernie's accountant pleaded guilty to fraud in the case last July, Andy and Mark Madoff were named by prosecutors as 'co-conspirators,' according to news accounts.

Andy and other members of the family had been using the ill-gotten funds from the scheme as their 'personal piggy bank,' according to the court-appointed trustee given the mammoth job of liquidating the Madoff business, a task that included seeking a whopping $153 million from the estates of the Madoff brothers, Andy and Mark.

In an interview with People Magazine, Andy Madoff pleaded his innocence and declared he felt 'horrible for the people whose lives have been destroyed by my father's crimes.'
