These newly re-released images show the moment Adolf Hitler rose to power - exactly 80 years ago today.

On January 30, 1933, the man who would become one of the worst tyrants in history was appointed Chancellor of Germany, the first step towards his creation of a totalitarian regime.

The photos are part of an online gallery published by newsreel company British Pathe in order to record the pivotal moment in history.

Prophetic: The newsreel's caption hints at the consternation the world felt towards Hitler's growing power

The original caption used by British 
Pathe on its footage back in 1933 was chillingly prophetic, stating that
 Hitler was now master of his own destiny - and hinting that only fear 
and uncertainty lay ahead.

It
 compared Hitler, a former lowly soldier from Austria, to Otto von 
Bismarck, the famous 19th Century statesman who unified Germany through 
war.

The full caption read 
as follows: 'BERLIN ... ADOLF HITLER assumes Bismarck's mantle as 
Germany's chancellor. He is now master of his adopted country's destiny 
and a wondering world awaits ... what?'

Pictures in the online gallery show 
the Nazi dictator surrounded by his henchmen, including Hermann Göring, 
who was also appointed Minister of the Interior for Prussia.

A
 spokesman for British Pathe said: 'Hitler's appointment as Chancellor 
was significant in his rise to power and the footage from 80 years ago 
is an important piece of history because of what followed.'

Hitler immediately began consolidating his power and dismantled a number of freedoms in Germany

Hitler was able to achieve power thanks to the backing of captains of industry, businessmen and powerul politicians. He had come second in the 1932 election

Hitler was appointed chancellor by 
German statesman Paul von Hindenburg after three elections had not 
resulted in the formation of a majority government.

Von
 Hindenburg had reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as leader after 
influential politicians, industrialists and businessmen urged him to do 
so.

Hitler
 was to head a short-lived coalition government formed by his own 
National Socialist German Workers Party and another party, the German 
National People's Party.

On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office.

Hitler had initially tried to seize 
power in 1923 in an event known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The NSDAP 
stormed a public meeting at the Bürgerbräukeller, a large beer hall in 
Munich, and declared the formation of a new government.

However, the coup failed and Hitler 
was arrested and spent a year in prison. While serving his sentence he 
wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle), an autobiography and ideological text 
that laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one 
based on race.

After his release he set about rebuilding the NSDAP and concentrated on achieving power through a more legitimate political path.

He exploited the discontent a number of Germans, particularly farmers, war veterans, and the middle class, felt after the trials of the Great Depression, and steadily rose to power.

After his appointment as chancellor in
 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a 
single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic 
ideology of Nazism.

He launched a campaign of 
hatred and genocide against Jews and his action soon plunged Europe - 
and eventually the whole world - into a war that claimed an estimated 
50million lives.
