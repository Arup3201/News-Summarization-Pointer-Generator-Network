An historic steam railway line, which was closed for three years following a landslide, has reopened after engine enthusiasts raised a staggering £1million to pay for repairs.

A 12-mile stretch of the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway (GWR) has been out of action since March 2010 after a two centuries-old embankment at Gotherington, Gloucestershire, collapsed and a second part of the track was damaged by further landslips in January 2011.

But the generosity of an anonymous donor and readers of an enthusiasts magazine have helped raise enough money to get the popular heritage railway, which carries some 70,000 every year, back on track.

From this weekend, steam engines will once again be using the line which runs from Cheltenham Racecourse to Laverton, in Gloucestershire.

President of the GWR and pop music mogul Pete Waterman initially launched an appeal to raise enough funds to repair the railway back in 2010 after the initial landslide.

The former Popstars judge said at the time that repairing the line, which generates income of £1million each year, would be crucial for its volunteer workforce and the local tourist economy.

But campaigners' efforts took a hit in January 2011 after a further landslide at a place known as the 'Chicken Curve' damaged more of the track.

Hundreds of rail enthusiasts have since rallied round with many signing up for a GWR '300 Club' by donating £1,000 or more to the cause.

Readers of Steam Railway Magazine clubbed together to raise a staggering £70,000 for repairs and the £1million target was reached last month when an anonymous donor wrote a cheque for the remaining £7,000 after visiting the railway.

Chairman of the railway Malcolm Temple said: 'Other railways have really rallied round to help.

'We’ll never forget the very significant contribution that so many heritage railways have made.'

Repair work started in January and was expected to last four months and involved digging out the collapsed earthworks and rebuilding with new material.

Parts of the embankment were stabilised with 'soil nails' which extend into the earth and hold the embankment in place.

As well as steam engines, diesel trains will also run between the Cotswold towns of Winchcombe and Toddington - with the entire line linking Cheltenham and Laverton for the first time since 1979.

The line was originally built between 1900 and 1906 but closed by British Rail in 1976. It was mostly taken apart and its amenities demolished by the end of the 1970s, but the route was bought in 1981 by the Great Western Steam Railway, known now as the GWR, in 1981.

The eventual plan is to further extend the line.

The campaign to repair the GWR had been launched by music producer and train enthusiast Pete Waterman, pictured, but the campaign suffered a setback following a second landslide in January 2011
