Johan Cruyff  labelled Holland's performance during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Turkey in their Euro 2016 qualifier 'a disgrace' - but manager Guus Hiddink insists he does not fear for his job.

Hiddink's side needed a 93rd minute  equaliser from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who inadvertently deflected in Wesley Sneijder's shot, to save a point in Amsterdam.

The result leaves Holland third in  Group A, five points behind Iceland in second and six off leaders Czech Republic but Hiddink rejected reports on Tuesday suggesting he is on the verge of being dismissed.

Johan Cruyff has revealed his dismay at Holland's performance in the encounter against Turkey

'The author of the article is present (in the press room) so you should ask him,' Hiddink said at a press conference. 'I don't have the feeling that they (the Dutch Football Association, the KNVB) want to sack me and I still have a lot of fun in my job. There is nothing going on.'

Pressure on Hiddink had earlier been heightened after Cruyff's damning verdict on the performance against Turkey.

'Holland were terrible against Turkey. Nobody did what they had to do,' Cruyff wrote in his column in De Telegraaf.

'The defenders were only passing the ball to the midfielders and they then passed it back to the defenders,' he added. 'The people with little creativity were dictating play. This is not what you want. The problems only got bigger.'

Holland have the opportunity to make amends when they host Spain on Tuesday in a friendly which sees the two sides meet for the first time since the Dutch routed the then World Cup holders 5-1 at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.

Spain prepared for the friendly with a 1-0 home victory over Ukraine, a strike from Alvaro Morata moving them three points clear of their rivals in second place in Group C.

Vicente del Bosque's side are three points behind group leaders Slovenia, who have five wins from five, but their attention will now turn to avenging their World Cup defeat to Holland. 

'There's always a rematch in football,' Juan Bernat of Bayern Munich told Spain's official website. 'That's what is so nice about this sport and what we will experience against the Netherlands after the match in the Brazil World Cup.'
