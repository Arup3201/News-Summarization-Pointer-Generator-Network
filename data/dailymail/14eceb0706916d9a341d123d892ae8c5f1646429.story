It's less than a week since Prince Charles was last in Saudi Arabia and just under three months since Prince Harry last visited the Middle East.

Now Clarence House has announced that the Prince of Wales is to set out on a whirlwind solo tour of the region early next month, with the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Kuwait on the itinerary.

However, the trip could prove controversial thanks to the presence of Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the schedule.

New tour: Charles, pictured here arriving in Riyadh last week, is to tour the Middle East next month

Regular visitor: Prince Charles arrives in Riyadh for the funeral of King Abdullah last weekend

Last week, as Prince Charles flew to the Middle East for the funeral of King Abdullah, protests were sparked by the House of Saud's record on human rights.

The dynasty has also been criticised for its strict interpretation of the Qu'ran which sees women banned from driving and have very few rights.

Critics have also pointed to the Saudi embrace of the death penalty; highlighted by a harrowing video that emerged last week of a woman running from an executioner who then took two attempts to behead her.

Qatar, meanwhile, has been mired in controversy following allegations of corruption and bribery related to its successful 2022 World Cup bid.

The emirate has also been criticised for allegedly funding terrorist organisations, as well as hosting the headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in its capital Doha.

Request: Charles, seen here with David Cameron in Riyadh, is travelling at the request of the Government

Return: One country that Charles will return to is Jordan, which he visited with Camilla last year (pictured)

Culture: Last year's visit to Jordan also included a visit to the ancient Roman ruins at Jaresh

Charles' tour, which is at the request of the Government, comes less than a year after he last toured the region, on that occasion with the Duchess of Cornwall.

During the 2014 tour, the couple had an almost identical itinerary with a single exception - Oman, which was on last year's tour, has been swapped for the UAE and Kuwait.

A statement released by Clarence House said Charles' early return to the region emphasises the 'importance' that the Government places on having close ties with the Middle East.

'The Prince of Wales's return to the region, only one year after his last tour, demonstrates the importance Her Majesty's Government places on its association with key partners in the area,' read the statement.

Entertaining: Charles and Camilla also travelled to Oman (Nizwah Fort pictured) but won't return this year

Controversial: Charles, pictured last year, will also visit Qatar - a destination likely to prove controversial

Meeting: Camilla with Queen Rania of Jordan (left) and teacher Amna Mahmoud at a Jeddah primary school

'These connections are underpinned by the long-standing and respectful relationships which exist between the Royal Family and the ruling families in the Gulf.'

Charles will certainly have time to meet many of those, with each of his stops set to be hosted by the local royal dynasties.

Among them are King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose capital Amman is the first stop, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, emir of Kuwait, and Qatari ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.

In the UAE, Charles will meet Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayyan, the crown prince and deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
