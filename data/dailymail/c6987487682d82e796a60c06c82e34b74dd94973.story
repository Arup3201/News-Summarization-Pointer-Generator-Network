Loic Remy has been banned from driving after he admitted being one-and-a-half times the drink limit.

When the France striker’s Porsche Cayenne was stopped by police in Newcastle in March, a test showed he had 56mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The limit is 35mg.

The 27-year-old QPR player was on loan to Newcastle United at the time.

He is now subject to speculation that he could move from Loftus Road to another Premier League team for between £8.5 million and £15 million.

Wearing ripped designer jeans, a black T-shirt, a gold chain, and carrying a backpack, Remy appeared before District Judge Jane Hamilton at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court.

He was driving on the A696 dual carriageway at 4.15am towards his home in Darras Road, Ponteland, Northumberland, on Sunday March 9 when he was pulled over.

Newcastle United, for whom he was top scorer last season, had been due to play Everton that day but the game was rearranged some weeks previously.

The judge banned him for 14 months and fined him £3,750, plus £200 costs and a victim impact surcharge of £120. 

Jonathan Dunkley, defending, said the footballer had not hired a 'very expensive lawyer to try to find a loophole' in the case.

Mr
 Dunkley said: 'He said to me "Look, I have clearly made a mistake here,
 a very costly mistake, a very public mistake. I was out socialising 
with some friends. I thought I had carefully monitored what I had to 
drink, at the end of the evening I felt perfectly sober to drive myself 
and my friends back to my home in Ponteland.

'"If I thought for one millisecond I was over the limit, I would have paid £20 and got a taxi to take us home".'

His solicitor added: “This is a man who is a professional footballer, as you are probably aware, and he recently represented his country in Brazil.

“He sets himself incredibly high standards and he is very disappointed he has fallen short of those high standards today.”

The district judge warned Remy that if he ignored the ban it would be a serious offence and asked if he understood. 'Yeah, I know,' he replied.

The player did not comment to reporters as he got into a taxi and was driven away from court.
