The 999 handler who took the call from murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar's mother warning he was being groomed two months before he was murdered has resigned.

It has emerged the call handler has stood down and another staff member has been served with a misconduct notice by the police watchdog, which is investigating how the force responded to claims the boy was being groomed in the months leading up to his murder.

Breck's mother, Lorin LeFave, called police two months before her son's death at the hands of Lewis Daynes, claiming her son was being 'groomed for gay sex' by the 19-year-old, who was jailed for life on Monday.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission issued a misconduct notice to a member of staff at Surrey Police's call centre as part of its investigation into how the force handled the complaint.

The watchdog also confirmed in a statement released earlier this month that the actual call handler who spoke to Breck's mother has already resigned.

Its investigation will focus on how Surrey Police responded to the allegations of online grooming, including what actions it took and what actions it should have taken to protect the schoolboy.

Breck was stabbed to death at Daynes' flat in Grays, Essex in February last year.

An IPCC spokesman said it will also probe whether the force was working in accordance with child protection guidlines and whether the call handlers were given appropriate training.

Daynes was jailed for a minimum of 25 years at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday after admitting murdering the Caterham schoolboy, whom he groomed on a gaming forum.

IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor, who is overseeing the investigation, said: 'Our thoughts are with Breck's family.

'The investigators and I have met with Breck's parents to express our condolences and explain the scope of our investigation.

'We will be keeping them informed throughout the investigation.

'We have obtained details of the call made by Breck's mother to Surrey Police about the communication between her son and Lewis Daynes. 

'We need to understand how that information was acted on, and whether more could or should have been done to safeguard Breck.'

The watchdog began its investigation in November. 

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'The decision to resign by one of the members of staff was not connected to the investigation – she simply resigned and was not suspended either for this case or any other unrelated matter before she did so.' 

Following the sentencing of Daynes, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said: 'This has been a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Breck's friends and family.

'In December 2013 a call was made to Surrey Police by Breck's mother expressing concerns around online grooming and due to the prior contact the case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

'They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey Police following this communication.

'A review of practises in our call handling centre has since been carried out and changes have been implemented to improve the way information is handled and shared.

'We will co-operate fully with the ongoing investigation.'
