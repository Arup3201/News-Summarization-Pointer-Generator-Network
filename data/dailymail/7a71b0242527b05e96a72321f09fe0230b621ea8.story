David Cameron issued an apology to the families of the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster last night after apparently suggesting they were locked in a futile search for the truth.

The Prime Minister was forced into the embarrassing move following the leak of the ‘grossly offensive’ comments.

In them he also voiced frustration that ministers were not getting more credit for finally agreeing to the release of secret papers relating to the 1989 tragedy.

'Grossly offensive': Labour MP Lucianna Berger has asked David Cameron to apologise over remarks he made about the Hillsborough disaster

Mr Cameron told the Liverpool Daily 
Post that the campaign for justice by the Hillsborough families was 
‘like a blind man, in a dark room, looking for a black cat that isn’t 
there’.

He also complained about the media 
coverage Labour MP Andy Burnham was receiving, adding: ‘It was this 
Government that agreed to release the Hillsborough documents.’ 

Labour MPs seized on the comments, which they claimed were disrespectful.

Luciana Berger, Labour MP for 
Liverpool Wavertree, yesterday called on Mr Cameron in the Commons to 
‘withdraw these grossly offensive remarks’.

The Prime Minister ducked the issue, 
telling her:  ‘It is this Government that has done the right thing by 
opening up the Cabinet papers and trying to help those people find the 
closure they seek.’

Tragedy: 96 people died during a crush in the Leppings Lane End at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15, 1989

Never forgotten: Liverpool fans continue to display banners at their Anfield stadium calling for justice

But, within hours, he appeared to have backed down, authorising Downing Street to issue an apology.

A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister regrets if any offence has been caused. He didn’t in any way mean any offence.

Encouragement: Alison McGovern asked the Prime Minister to call on to South Yorkshire Police to release its documents

‘He was actually expressing his sympathy for how hard it can be to find closure coming to terms with grief.’

The tragedy, which cost 96 Liverpool fans their lives in1989, was also mentioned at PMQs by Labour Alison McGovern, who represents Wirral South.

She called on Mr Cameron to encourage South Yorkshire Police - the force responsible for crowd control at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium on the day of the fatal FA Cup semi final - to release its documents.

She called for an independent panel reviewing the tragedy to have 'unredacted access to all papers'.

Mr Cameron told her: 'The Government has done what it should in terms of the Cabinet papers, but I'm very happy to look at what you raise and come back to you.'
