Stella McCartney has long held the torch for the ethical treatment of animals in fashion and food.

The fashion designer uses no animal products in her designs and has been a vegetarian since childhood, a lifestyle that was championed by her mother Linda and father Paul.

But the 43-year-old is now calling on fellow consumers to pay more attention to what goes into their meals and garments - by thinking about that final product came from.

Stella McCartney attends an event to honour Kate Moss last April. The designer is calling on consumers to be more aware of where their food and fashion comes from 

In a new interview with The Business Of Fashion (BoF) magazine, she said: 'The consumption of animals - whether you're wearing them or eating them - is extraordinarily damaging to the planet.

'There are over a billion animals killed a year for food, half of which don't even get eaten. And there's over 50 million animals killed just for fashion.'

'If you're mindful of how you're approaching your life, then you see the connection. You can't avoid the connection.

'The connection between food, illness, environment. I want to see everything as a whole, so that's how I approach life, and that's how it comes into my business.'

At the start of her fashion career, many criticised Stella - who helped kick off the vegetarian movement Meat Free Mondays with her father - for her refusal to produce and clothes with leather, fur or feathers.

But while the mother-of-four is something of a pioneer in ethical high fashion, she concedes that finding high-quality substitutes is a challenge.

‘Material is hard,' she said: 

‘Clearly leather is a great material. It wears well. It moves. You can wash it. It’s real. One of the hardest things is to design something that is desirable and then to take that design and make it in a way that is not conventional. 

'We’re sourcing our own material, developing our own material - we’re not using PVC.’

And, ahead of a lecture she is holding with the magazine tonight in London, Stella said she even feels the need to apologise to her designers  for the limitations of using non-leather alternatives. 

Stella McCartney talks with BOF founder and Editor in Chief, Imran Amed about sustainability in fashion at the sold-out launch of BOF Voices at Second Home in London at 7pm tonight.
