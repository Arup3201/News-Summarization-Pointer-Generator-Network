Following reports London is set to get a staggering 250 new high rises and skyscrapers over the next decade, a British architect has created his own vision of the capital’s future.

In David Edwards’ concept designs, wind turbines are built on the Thames, Waterloo Bridge is transformed into a garden, and The Shard is upstaged by a series of pointed skyscrapers all over the city.

Edwards developed the concepts to promote the sci-fi film The Machine, released in cinemas next week.

Following reports London is set to get a staggering 250 new high rises and skyscrapers over the next decade, a British architect has created his own vision of the capital's future, pictured. In David Edwards' concept designs, wind turbines are built on the Thames, Waterloo Bridge is transformed into a garden and The Shard is upstaged by a series of pointed skyscrapers all over the city

In one image a transparent tunnel is shown weaving through east London, passed Tower Bridge and in front of City Hall that could be used as a new transport line for commuters, or to transport items across the capital.

In another, a large military helicopter hovers above Westminster and towards the Houses of Parliament.

Producer of the Machine, John Giwa-Amu told MailOnline: '[Director] Caradog [W James] and myself were keen to represent a future that felt both real and relevant. We wanted an image of a flooded London with a skyline on steroids to capture audience's imaginations as it captured ours.'

Edwards’ vision, taken from the plot of the film, is set in the near future when the world is in the depths of another Cold War.

It depicts a city where the Ministry of Defence is working on keeping a close eye on its residents as it develops a robotic soldier.

In this image the banks of the River Thames are almost at bursting point. A transparent tunnel, pictured left, is shown weaving through east London, passed Tower Bridge and in front of City Hall that could be used as a new transport line for commuters, and to transport items across the capital

To power all the extra skyscrapers littered across London's skyline, pictured centre, Edward placed wind turbines in the River Thames near the Houses of Parliament. This image shows how London could look from a pod on the London Eye, pictured left

In the film, this soldier, called The Machine, has been designed to look like a human, but with superhuman strength, speed and fighting skills.

However, a bug in its programming causes it to take over and destroy the lab, threatening the city.

Although the concept images were commissioned especially for the film, they bear a striking resemblance to the proposed plans unveiled this morning.

An architectural think-tank has identified 236 buildings of more than 20 storeys in London that could be on the way, four fifths of them intended as high-rise blocks of flats.

A further 18 will be offices, eight will be hotels, 13 are mixed use, and one is to be an educational institute, according to New London Architecture.

Work has already begun on U.S. insurance firm WR Berkley's new European headquarters, dubbed the 'Scalpel'.

Other approved schemes including the so-called 'Can of Ham', and The Pinnacle, which was dubbed 'Helter-Skelter, have been put on hold.

In the case of The Pinnacle, developers went back to the drawing board to try to make the scheme more cost efficient.

Nearly half have already been approved and about a fifth are now being built, according to a study by the think tank based on local authority figures, and they are set to drastically reshape the London skyline, with 33 of them between 40 and 49 floors, and 22 with 50 or more.

The building boom is concentrated in London's centre and it’s hitherto dilapidated east, which together account for 77 per cent of the new skyscrapers. Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Greenwich, Newham and Southwark will between them have 140 of the 236 towers.

The Machine is in cinemas/VoD 21 March and DVD/Blu-ray 31 March.
