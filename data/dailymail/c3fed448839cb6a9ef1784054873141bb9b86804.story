Prince Charles said he feared the next generation of pensioners will be 'consigned to an exceptionally miserable future'

Prince Charles has launched a stinging attack on the pensions industry, accusing it of adopting a short-term approach that risks causing misery for the elderly in the future.

The heir to the throne said he feared the next generation of pensioners would be ‘consigned to an exceptionally miserable future’ unless the sector mended its ways.

If it did not, he said, it could become ‘unfit for purpose’.

The prince, who will be old enough to collect his free bus pass next month, made his comments in a pre-recorded speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Manchester.

And yesterday he had pensions experts queueing up to praise him.

Many pointed to a report by pensions expert and ex-Downing Street advisor Ros Altmann, who earlier this week called for an overhaul of pensions and argued they were ‘not fit for 21st-century lives’.

Dr Altmann backed Charles’s comments, saying: ‘Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don’t want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children’s future away.’

Paul Green, director of communications for over-50s body Saga, said Charles was ‘absolutely right’ to speak out.

Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘This is an entirely reasonable point to make, but it is not the role of the head of state to make it – and he is supposed to be in training to be head of state.

‘He has to stay above political controversy and he should think about keeping his mouth bandaged.

‘Every now and again the Prince of 
Wales is going to say something right. Some of what he says is right, 
but some of it is eccentric and some of it is barmy.’

Aides insist the prince has a right to make his opinions known as part of the monarchy’s role to ‘advise, encourage and warn’.

Critics, however, have long warned the
 prince risks riding a coach and horses through the institution’s need 
to remain impartial.

They say it will be impossible for him to put aside
 such deeply held views when he becomes king and that his clear lack of 
neutrality are likely to cause huge constitutional tensions.

Prince Charles said that unless Britain can support its ageing population, it is consigned to a miserable future

In
 his address, the prince said: ‘We live in increasingly uncertain times.

'We are facing what could be described as a “perfect storm” – the 
combination of pollution and over-consumption of finite natural 
resources; the very real and accumulating risk of catastrophic climate 
change; unprecedented levels of financial indebtedness, and a population
 of 7 billion that is rising fast.

‘You
 have a need, and arguably a duty, to ensure these emerging 
environmental, social and economic risks are identified and managed.

‘With
 an ageing population, and pension fund liabilities that are therefore 
stretching out for many decades, surely the current focus on “quarterly 
capitalism” is becoming increasingly unfit for purpose?’

He
 continued: ‘I know that old habits die hard and that it is difficult to
 make the first move, but is there not a case for ensuring your 
portfolios are resilient in the long-term?

‘I
 can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make 
that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs – 
otherwise your grandchildren, and mine for that matter, will be 
consigned to an exceptionally miserable future.’

New
 rules force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers for the 
first time, a revolution affecting up to 11 million people. All workers,
 aged between 22 and State pension age, who are not members of a pension
 scheme, are being signed up to a pension by their boss, known as 
‘automatic enrolment’.

A worker pays just 1 per cent of his or her salary into the scheme with the boss contributing the same amount.

By 2018, the minimum contribution will have increased to a total of 8 per cent.

Miss Segars said: ‘There are not many of us who think that the 8 per cent is enough to deliver a decent pension.’
