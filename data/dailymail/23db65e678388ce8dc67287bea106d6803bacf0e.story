From lavish Bollywood film sets to sparkling saris and colourful curries, India has an international reputation for embracing a rainbow of shades.

And yesterday the vivid spirit of the nation was kept alive at a celebration to herald the arrival of spring - the  Lathmar Holi Festival.

Thousands of Hindus travelled to the small villages of Nandgaon and Barsana in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to throw an array of striking powders at each other.

Destination: The small villages of Nandgaon and Barsana in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh played host to the colourful celebration

Roots: A Hindu devotee prays. The tradition of playing with colours on Holi draws its roots from a legend of Radha and the Hindu God Krishna

A prelude to the major national Holi 
spring festival - known as the Festival of Colours - it sees 
participants shower each other with brightly coloured dyes and millions 
of flower petals.

According
 to legend, Lord Krishna visited his principle consort and childhood 
friend, Radha, in the village on this day and playfully teased her and 
her friends. The women responded by chasing him away with sticks.

In
 the festival men in traditional dress take on the role of gops (friends
 of Krishna), while women play gopis (friends of Radha).

The
 men sing provocative songs and throw the coloured powders and flowers 
on the women, who fight back by pretending to beat them with bamboo.

Legend: In the Lathmar Holi festival, the men from Nandgaon first come to the neighbouring village of Barsana to play Holi with the women there. On the second day, men from Barsana travel to Nandgaon to play the game with their women

Fun: Young men smeared in various colours joyfully celebrate the festival, which heralds the start of spring

It is claimed that the Hindu 
deity Krishna, who was dark in colour, was jealous of the fair-coloured 
Radha. He pestered his foster mother Yasodha about it so much that, fed 
up, she told him he could change Radha's skin by sprinkling her with 
colours.

Krishna and his 
shepherd friends visited Radha and her cowherd girls on this day and 
teased her by throwing colours at her. She and the girls responded by 
chasing them away with the sticks, called lathis.

During breaks from the action, those
 taking part sip an a cold drink called thandai, intoxicating because it
 is laced with bhang paste, which is made from cannabis, known to 
Indians as 'ganja'.

After 
quaffing the bhang, the participants laugh, cry and crave sweets, the 
ecstatic experience heightened by the theatrical revelry of the 
festivities.
