It's a magical moment when a man finds out he is going to be a father for the first time.

But when Tennessee man Jordan Cocklin was told the news by his wife through specially designed bottles of beer, his reaction wasn't exactly what she was hoping for.

Kelsey decided to make the big announcement using bottles of beer tucked away in the fridge - labelled 'Daddy's Beer' and 'Oops' - and film her husband's reaction as he opened the door. 

'Oh': Jordan seems unimpressed by news that he will soon become a dad, as Kelsey rolls camera

Loved up: Married couple Jordan and Kelsey Cocklin posted the amusing clip on YouTube

But when it dawns on Jordan that he is soon to be a dad, he only manages an 'Oh', followed by 'For real?'

The couple, who live in Nashville, decided his underwhelmed reaction was so funny they would post it on YouTube, where it has so far been viewed more than 300,000 times.

Speaking to Buzzfeed, Jordan said his awkward reaction was because of total shock, not disappointment.

He said: '[It was] total shock at first but as soon as she turned ioff [the camera] we were just ecstatic'.

'Any new dad is going to have an original feeling of shock - mine just happened to be caught on camera', he added. 

Jordan said he would consider showing the video to his future son or daughter when they're older.

Just checking: Jordan's response to finding the beers is 'Oh' and 'For real?'

Expecting: Jordan and Kesley are now expecting their first child together
