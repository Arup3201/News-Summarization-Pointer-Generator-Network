Arsene Wenger wants Theo Walcott to sign a new Arsenal contract — but warned the forward he is not guaranteed to start every week.

Walcott’s current deal expires at the end of next season and talks have begun over a new contract.

However, it is unclear whether he sees his long-term future at the club given how little he has featured.

But Wenger has warned the forward he is not guaranteed to start every week and will have to fight for place

Walcott has started just four times since returning from a knee injury in November and first-team prospects are likely to be central to talks.

The 25-year-old, who earns close to £100,000 per week, is also likely to expect a pay increase. 

Wenger said: ‘Will his lack of playing time have an impact? Of course. I want him to stay and be a regular player but no matter where you go, if it is a big club you have to compete for your place.’

Captain Mikel Arteta returned to training on Friday after four months out with calf and ankle problems.

The Spaniard, who is three weeks away from playing, is out of contract in the summer but is expected to sign a new 12-month deal.

Wenger also confirmed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss four weeks with a hamstring injury. Jack Wilshere is nearing fitness following minor ankle surgery.
