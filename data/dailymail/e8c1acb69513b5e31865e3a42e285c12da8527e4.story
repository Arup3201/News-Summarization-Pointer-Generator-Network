Kim Delaney, the star of Lifetime's drama show 'Army Wives', was last night kicked off stage at an event honouring the former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates after slurring her way through a bizarre speech.

Ms Delaney stumbled to the podium at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, then repeatedly stalled her words and fiddled with her hands as she talked about having 'served in active military duty family for five years', even though she is an actress in a fictional programme.

She was supposed to be honouring Mr Gates, who was receiving the Liberty Medal during the ceremony.

Make-believe: It wasn't until two minutes in that Ms Delaney admitted her Army experience was only fictional

'I've seen soldiers come home with painful life-altering injuries borne of their time and service,' she said, stuttering.

'I've attended numerous military funerals, including that of my best friend’s son. And my heart has been broken on numerous occasions.'

She then paused, saying, 'Ummm', before 
continuing: 'As I try to comfort wives, husbands, family members, 
fathers, children... loved ones made good, what I've learned is the 
Constitution Center.

'Knowing no words, no talk or anything can ever bring back their people.'

She then came clean. 'But for me it’s
all make believe. I do that as a job. It’s make believe,' she said 
nearly two minutes into her speech.

'I have the luxury to do all of this on a television show.'

Video from WPVI shows the crowd growing uncomfortable as Ms Delaney rambled on. She was escorted off stage before finishing her remarks.

Ms Delaney, 49, has had issues with substance abuse in the past.

In 2002, she was arrested for suspicion of drunk driving after she refused to take a breathalyser test. She has sought rehab for alcohol addiction twice.

Ms Delaney has been married twice, to actor Charles Grant from 1984 to 1988 and to actor Joseph Cortese from 1989 to 1994.

She gave birth to son John 'Jack' Philip Cortese in 1990.

She was engaged to producer Alan Barnette from 1997–2006, and is currently single.
