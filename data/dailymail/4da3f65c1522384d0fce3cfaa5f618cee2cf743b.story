When Shaunna Lane's best friend suggested she should do a photo shoot to boost her confidence, after much thought, the naive girl, who was a teenager at the time, decided to strip down for a series of arty nude shots.

And she was so thrilled with the photos that she decided to share them with her then boyfriend.

Her confidence was completely destroyed when the pictures were circulated around the world via a revenge porn website.

Rocked by public humiliation, Shauna, from Harlow in Essex, who is now 22, became too scared to leave her home after being targeted by hundreds of internet sex trolls, who inundated her with crude messages and even threatened to rape her.

'My privacy, my intimacy, my body had been completely violated. The pictures were taken and shared with trust.' Shauna said. 'I've felt embarrassed and ashamed, but I was wronged and there should be some justice for that.'

Now she is sharing her story and the pictures in question herself as part of her campaign against revenge porn.

She explains: 'I want to raise awareness about revenge porn - it's a life-ruining problem that needs to be policed.'

'My images are out there for everyone to see, you can search and find them. What difference does it make if the images appear in a newspaper or on a news site if they’re already everywhere else?

'I don't mind if it makes another girl stop and think before sharing intimate photographs.'

Peers rejected calls to create a new criminal offence of revenge porn, as it was 'covered by existing laws'

Days after the images went live Shaunna was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum

For Shaunna, it wasn't just about the photographs, it was about the vile trolling that followed in the aftermath of their publication.

'I was 
called a whore and slut and told how ugly I was. I have been discussed 
like a piece of meat,' says the traumatised young woman.

'I
 would get messages from perverts who would say I'm going to come and 
find you, or I can't wait to rape you. It left me completely shocked, I 
was afraid to leave my home.

'I
 stayed in the house for weeks after images went up. My full name and 
Facebook information had been shared, making me even more vulnerable.

'It has completely shattered my confidence. I didn't want to have sex with my current boyfriend because I felt judged, and paranoid and the thought of being naked filled me with anxiety.'

Last month the House of Lords discussed making serious changes to social media which would mean establishing the identity of account holders - stripping internet trolls of their anonymity.

However the peers rejected calls to make 'revenge porn' a criminal offence, as it was judged to be adequately covered by existing obscenity and harassment laws.

But they insisted clear guidance was needed for police and prosecutors to help them secure convictions.

It has led to calls from some campaigners - including Lib Dems - for the UK to follow the example of a number of states in the US where laws aims at stopping revenge porn have been introduced.

Ministers say scorned exes submitting revenge porn is a growing problem and claim they will only take action if they have public backing.

But for Shaunna, a welfare officer, a change in the law couldn't come sooner.

She said: 'It is despicable that there has been no law to protect me and other girls in situations like this.

'You'd be arrested if you went to the park and took pictures of other people's kids.

'Why was it okay for someone to upload my private and intimate pictures to a website without my permission?

'There should be privacy laws or anything that stops this from happening. It shouldn't have happened to me and it shouldn't happen to anyone else.'

At the time Shaunna was thrilled with the photos and decided to share them with her boyfriend

Sharing her ordeal Shaunna told how she first discovered the images when she was left baffled by endless online friend requests and a stream of sexually explicit messages on Facebook.

Reading through the trolled posts she was left horrified when she discovered links to her naked photos plastered across a vile revenge porn site.

But Shaunna was to suffer further humiliation. Days after the images went live she was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum.

Sharing the naked pictures and claiming she had 'raised a whore' men from across the world contacted Sarah Lane, 43, asking for sex with her daughter.

'Can you imagine having to explain to your mum why there are naked pictures of you on the internet?' said Shaunna.

'Or worse still, having some pervert pose as one of your friends on Facebook, add you, just to find members of your family to message them the photos.

'My mum was devastated for me. She is hugely protective, like any mum she's like a lioness with her cub she just wanted to kill the person who did it.

'She's tried everything to take them down. She has been hugely supportive of me, but no mother should have to see their daughter associated with a site like this.

'No mum should be told their little girl is a slut or be asked if she is willing to paid so they could have sex with me.'

Shaunna was a typical teenage girl struggling with how she looked when a model friend advised she do a naked shoot to boost her body confidence.

The tasteful portfolio of pictures was never intended for public use.

Feeling flirty and exhilarated with her new-found confidence she was quick to share the images with her then boyfriend.

Last year she began dating new boyfriend Karl Bond, 24, and she thought nothing more of her naked pictures.

But Shaunna was left rocked when messages started filtering into her 'Other' message box on Facebook from men in America, Germany and across the UK linking back to a certain revenge porn site.

Frightened in her own home and desperate to have the pictures taken down, Shaunna contacted the website only to be told it would cost £240 ($400) to have the images removed.

But it was too late - just two days later, her naked images were appearing across social networks and circulating amongst people she knew.

Shauna added: 'There was no stopping it, even if I tried to take them down they were every where. People could Google and find me naked on the internet.

'Its terrifying because you have no control and it ruins your life.

'I felt hugely ashamed, I couldn't be naked, I hated my body.

'Ultimately I was embarrassed.'

The site in question is a US domain designed for scorned lovers to get back at their exes by posting their most intimate, personal and degrading pictures or videos.

Unfortunately victims are unable determine who was responsible for their individual 'ex' post, as website disguises any IP addresses shielding the original source.

While the site is the hub of the images, it accepts no responsibility for its content and will only remove pictures if they are of minors or a fee is paid.

'Sites like this are dangerous.' She said, 'Girls need to think more carefully about the images they take of themselves because once they are out there, there really is no going back.

'It should be illegal. It ruins your life.'

Struggling to come to terms with her daughter's ordeal, mother Sarah, also from Harlow said: 'When I saw the images on the website, initially I felt sick, the comments were horrendous.

'The first message I got on Facebook said something along the lines of "look what someone has done to your daughter" along with abuse.

'I was very shocked and upset for Shaunna.

'Me and her boyfriend Karl have had other messages since, offering money or calling her names which is despicable.

'But my biggest concerns are that her details have been shared.

'People know her in her home town, and I am glad that her grandparents don't do social media. I worry it could potentially affect her future employment but hope that people aren't so narrow-minded.'

'After seeing some of the images I am not surprised by stories of suicides. It is probably the most humiliating thing you can do to someone.'

In 2011 
Henry Moore, 27, is thought to have created the first ever so-called 
revenge porn site called IsAnyoneUp that featured naked selfless 
alongside victims Facebook profile shots, visitors to the site knew 
exactly who they were looking for and how to contact them.

While
 many women had fallen victim of revengeful exes posting onto the site 
many claimed their images had been posted as a result of their social 
media and email being hacked.

Moore,
 who became known as the most hated man on the internet, profited more 
then $13,000 a month in advertisement from the site, which he dubbed Nakedbook, before it was shut down by an anti-bullying charity, 
BullyVille, in 2012. 

But
 the precedence had been set, and soon after anonymous revenge porn 
pages began to pop up across the internet and social media.

There
 are few statistics relating to porn revenge cases in the UK. However 
new findings by American-based PewResearch revealed that nine per cent 
of American mobile phone users had sent a suggestive picture of video, 
while 20 per cent had received one.

The
 figures had risen from 2012 - when six per cent of phone users had sent
 a text which was sexual in nature, also called a sext, and 15 per cent 
had received one. Only three per cent of people admitted they had 
forwarded a sext. 

In
 the UK revenge porn is on the rise but legal action can only be taken 
if the pictures taken are deemed a breach of copyright law, harassment,
 or the subject of the pictures is under 18.
