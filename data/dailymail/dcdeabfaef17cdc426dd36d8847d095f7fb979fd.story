President Obama has moved closer to military intervention in Syria, after stating that the alleged chemical attack by the Assad regime last week warranted a 'serious response.'

Obama said time was running out for Assad to allow UN weapons inspectors to view the site of the alleged attack near Damascus, where as many as 1,300 people died on Wednesday.

A government source said Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed all options should be kept open, while taking a clear stance that the West will not abide by chemical weapon attacks on innocent civilians.

President Obama appeared on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday to discuss the alleged attack, saying it was a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention

'They reiterated that significant use of 
chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international 
community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options,' a British government spokesman told the Guardian.

Obama had spoken at length to Cameron on Saturday, in a conversation that led him to believe Assad was most likely behind the chemical attack.

His move towards a more serious response comes as four battleships move within striking range of Syria, which has been locked in a deadly civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2011.

Obama was said to be 'gravely concerned' by the attack and increasing signs that it was carried out against Syrians by Assad's forces.

'The fact that President Assad has failed to co-operate with the UN suggests that the regime has something to hide,' a spokesman said. 

The spokesman added that the President and Cameron, 'Reiterated that significant use of 
chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international 
community'.

'They agreed that it is vital that the world upholds the prohibition on 
the use of chemical weapons and deters further outrages.'

The
 tougher stance comes as U.S. defense secretary Chuck Hagel told 
reporters in Kuala Lumpa that Obama was still considering whether to use
 military force.

He 
said the Administration had to account for several factors, including 
intelligence on the Syrian attack, legal issues and the level of 
international support for a military response.

Prepared: Chuck Hagel, right, says the President has ordered the Pentagon to prepare potential military options

Obama had previously warned a chemical attack would signify Assad had crossed a 'red line'.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declined
 to discuss specific force movements but said Obama had asked the 
Pentagon to prepare military options for Syria.

U.S.
 defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a 
fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern 
Mediterranean Sea but without immediate orders for any missile launch 
into Syria.

U.S. Navy ships 
are capable of a variety of military actions, including launching 
Tomahawk cruise missiles, as they did against Libya in 2011 as part of 
an international action that led to the overthrow of the Libyan 
government.

'The Defense 
Department has a responsibility to provide the president with options 
for contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces, positioning
 our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever 
options the President might choose,' Hagel told reporters traveling with
 him to Asia.

Hagel said the U.S. is coordinating 
with the international community to determine 'what exactly did happen' 
near Damascus earlier this week. 

According to reports, a chemical attack in a suburb of the capital killed at least 100 people.

It
 would be the most heinous use of chemical weapons since Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in the town of Halabja in 1988.

Hagel
 left little doubt that he thinks the attack in Syria involved chemical 
weapons, although he stressed there is not yet a final answer.

In discussing the matter, he said, 'it appears to be what happened - use of chemical weapons.'

Escalation: Angela Kane, the UN's high representative for disarmament, arrives in Damascus, Syria on Saturday to press President Bashar Assad to let UN investigators look into the reported chemical attack

Four battleships have been moved to within striking range of Syria as President Obama weighs his options following a reported use of chemical weapons against citizens on Wednesday

UN
 disarmament chief, Angela Kane, arrived in Damascus on Saturday to 
press the Syrian government to allow UN experts to investigate the 
alleged chemical attacks.

Obama
 remained cautious about getting involved in a war that has killed more 
than 100,000 people and now includes Hezbollah and al-Qaeda.

He made no mention of the 'red line' 
of chemical weapons use that he marked out for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad a year ago and that U.S. intelligence says has been breached at 
least on a small scale several times since.

'If
 the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a UN mandate and 
without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions 
in terms of whether international law supports it - do we have the 
coalition to make it work?' Obama said Friday. 'Those are considerations
 that we have to take into account.'

Obama
 conceded in an interview on CNN's 'New Day' program that the episode is
 a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention.

He
 said any large-scale chemical weapons usage would affect 'core national
 interests' of the U.S. and its allies. But nothing he said signaled a 
shift toward U.S. action.

U.S. defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly.

But
 if the U.S. wants to send a message to Assad, the most likely military 
action would be a Tomahawk missile strike, launched from a ship in the 
Mediterranean.

For a year 
now, Obama has threatened to punish Assad's regime if it resorted to its
 chemical weapons arsenal, among the world's vastest, saying use or even
 deployment of such weapons of mass destruction constituted a 'red line'
 for him. 

A U.S. 
intelligence assessment concluded in June chemical weapons have been 
used in Syria's civil war, but Washington has taken no military action 
against Assad's forces.

U.S. officials have instead focused on trying to organize a peace conference between the government and opposition.

Obama has authorized weapons deliveries to rebel groups, but none are believed to have been sent so far.

Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.'

'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria

In his first comments on Syria since the alleged chemical attack, Obama said the U.S. was still trying to find out what happened. Hagel said on Friday that a determination on the chemical attack should be made swiftly because 'there may be another attack coming,' although he added that 'we don't know' whether that will happen.

After rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in February, U.S. confirmation took more than four months.

In this instance, a UN chemical weapons team is already on the ground in Syria.

Assad's government, then as now, has rejected the claims as baseless.

Obama also cited the need for the U.S. to be part of a coalition in dealing with Syria. America's ability by itself to solve the Arab country's sectarian fighting is 'overstated,' he said.
