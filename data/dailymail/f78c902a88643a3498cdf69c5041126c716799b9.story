The death of Margaret Thatcher dominated the front pages of newspapers around the world today, with publications from Canada and Kuwait to Slovakia and South Korea carrying iconic images of the former British Prime Minister.

While many were accompanied by positive headlines hailing the enduring legacy of the Conservative premier, The Citizen in South Africa summed up the fierce divisions of opinion she created both in life and death.

The paper splashed 'hailed and despised' over a picture of Mrs Thatcher waving, along with the line: 'Fans praise Iron Lady, but her death leaves others cold'.

In France, a former minister and presidential candidate whipped up a storm after suggesting Mrs Thatcher, who died of a stroke aged 87 yesterday, will go to hell.

Mixed reaction: The Citizen (left) in South Africa sums up the way Lady Thatcher divided opinion so sharply saying 'fans praise Iron Lady, but her death leaves others cold', while she is also heavily featured on the front page of The Australian (right)

Jean-Luc Melenchon's comments were carried in several French newspapers, including Le Parisien, which described her as someone the people 'loved to hate'.

Mr Melenchon, who stood to become president last year, had tweeted: 'Margaret Thatcher will find out in hell, exactly what she did to the miners.'

It was a reference to Mrs Thatcher's hardline economic reforms in the 1980s which saw the closure of coal mines across the UK with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs amid violent protests by the unions.

Marc Blondel, former secretary general of CGT-FO union, was similarly vitriolic, saying. 'She wanted to pacify the union movement, but in doing so undermined democracy in her country.'

The Washington Times Daily carries a picture of Lady Thatcher with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan under the headline 'a fiercely loyal and tough ally', while ABC Madrid in Spain dedicates most of its front page to a portrait photograph of the former Conservative leader

Held in high regard: Canada's National Post praised Mrs Thatcher as 'a courageous reformer, an unflinching leader' while The Kuwait Times pay tributes to the 'UK's first woman premier'

There is a more conciliatory view from 
France's former Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, however, who in 1982 
persuaded Mrs Thatcher to sanction the building of the Channel Tunnel.

He
tells l'Express that she was a 'formidable opponent', and a 'great 
British Prime Minister despite being a conservative, even reactionary.'

There
are numerous references in the press to Francois Mitterrand, the former
Socialist President who once said Thatcher 'has the eyes of Caligula 
and the voice of Marilyn Monroe.'

Papers like Le Monde and Le Figaro 
also carry the reaction of Opposition UMP leader Jean-François Cope who 
calls Thatcher 'an exceptional leader who knew, in every situation, how 
to defend her convictions and win out with them, without being too 
worried about polls or the pendulum of public opinion.'

Political powerhouse; Lady Thatcher had negotiated for the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, which took place in 1997, ending British rule there

Tributes from the Far East: Hong Kong's South 
China Morning Post and China's Shanghai Daily features images of Lady 
Thatcher's visits to the region during her tenure as Prime Minister

Global figure: The Malaysian Reserve and South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo also covered Mrs Thatcher's death

France's
far-right also pays homage, as the party led by Marine Le Pen, issued a
statement saying: 'The National Front salutes the memory of a leader of
conviction, deeply attached to the sovereignty of her country, and a 
resolute opponent of a federal Europe.'

Meanwhile, books of condolence were being opened in British embassies around the world so expatriates could pay their respects.

Mrs Thatcher's status as a global 
figurehead was evident in the coverage given to her in countries as far 
afield as China, Malaysia and Kuwait.

In Hong Kong, which was handed 
sovereignty from British rule in 1997 after negotiations by Mrs 
Thatcher, the South China Morning Post carries the headline 'Tributes 
flow for a giant of 20th Century' under a picture of her on a visit to 
the region during her tenure as Prime Minister.

Differing treatments: Italy's Libero features a caricature of Lady Thatcher as an angel and current German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the devil, while Poland's Metro carries a sombre picture of the late leader

Influential figure: The Komsomolskaya Pravda in Belarus (left) and the Kathimerini Greek (right) also led with the PM's death

Far-reaching: The Straits Times in Singapore and Indonesia's Jakarta Post both refer to her as nickname The Iron Lady

Eye-catching images: Diario de Noticias in Portugal,  features Lady Thatcher in her later years, while the Liechtensteiner Volksblatt shows her in a tank on a visit to Germany in 1986

Across the Atlantic, the Washington 
Times Daily describes her as a 'fiercely loyal and tough ally' alongside a
picture of her with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom they call 
the 'dynamic duo'.

Throughout the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher had formed a warm partnership with Reagan in defence of Western values and freedoms.

But despite the mismatch in power between their two nations, their friendship was always one of equals.

He called her 'the best man in England'. She returned the compliment, saying he was 'the second most important man in my life'.

In Canada, The National Post was equally complimentary, praising her as 'a courageous reformer, an unflinching leader'.

Face of history: Lady Thatcher is given a strong showing on the Tribune de Geneve in Switzerland, but less so in Japan's Mainichi Shimbun Digital

Unsurprisingly, there was a hostile 
reaction in the Argentinian press over her role in re-taking the 
Falkland Islands in 1982, a conflict that has created bitter relations 
between the two countries ever since.

Elements of the Argentine media 
portrayed Mrs Thatcher as a warmonger who prolonged the Falklands War for political ends, it was reported by The Bangkok Post.

'God bless the day that that terrible
woman has died," said Domenico Gruscomagno, 71.

'She was an odious 
person. In order to win elections in Great Britain, she waged war.'

Mario Volpe, leader of the Malvinas 
(Falklands) War Veterans Center, said Thatcher 'died without being 
punished, without having been put on trial.'

And here's a tribute you can't re-create in a newspaper...
