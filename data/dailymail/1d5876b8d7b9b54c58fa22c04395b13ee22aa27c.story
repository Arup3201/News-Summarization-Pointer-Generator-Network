Rolando Aarons has made a blistering start to life in the Newcastle first team. 

An impressive pre-season was capped with a goal against Schalke, before the start of the Premier League saw him come off the bench to score in just his second game at St James' Park.

But, according to his school football coach, the Magpie's new young hope will not be getting ahead of himself.

Perfect start: Aarons scored after coming off the bench against Crystal Palace in just his second league game

Humble: Aarons's former coach says he is a grounded individual who won't let the success go to his head 

Dave McGibbon, who worked with the England under-20 winger when he was growing up in Bristol, told the Bristol Post that Aarons is 'very humble'. 

'I used to call him Big Time Charlie because he wasn't like that at all – he has his feet on the ground.

'Some of the lads have stayed in touch with him – he's a grounded individual.

Big time: The winger has played for England at youth level and is destined for the top says McGibbon

Outstanding: McGibbon praised his former player's work rate and attitude and says he will go far

'He was outstanding here as a schoolboy. He was very much a local boy and he was very humble.

'He worked hard at his trade and his attitude to practise was first rate. He was a nice lad and a joy to teach.'
