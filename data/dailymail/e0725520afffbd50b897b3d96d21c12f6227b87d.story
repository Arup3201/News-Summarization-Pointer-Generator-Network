A suburban New York  judge smashed into another car while driving drunk in Manhattan following a Christmas party and then tried to persuade police to let him go because of his position, according to reports.

Harrison Town Justice Marc Lust, 63, was arrested on driving while intoxicated and other charges on December 19, shortly after 5pm. 

Police said his Jaguar rear-ended another car in midtown Manhattan and then he tried to drive off from the accident between 34th and 35th streets on 10th Avenue. 

Lust told police that he was a judge and would 'take care of this'.

Harrison Town Justice Marc Lust was arrested on driving while intoxicated and other charges on December 19 in Manhattan. Police said that he tried to use his powers as a judge to get out of the charges

He was unsteady, slurred his words and told them he'd had three drinks at a Christmas party, according to police.

The judge refused to take a breathalyzer test, according to lohud.com. 

The judge was charged with misdemeanor DWI and violations, driving while ability impaired and leaving the scene of an accident.

He was held in a cell overnight and arraigned the following day. The judge was released on $2,500 bail and had his license suspended. 

He is due back in Manhattan Criminal Court on January 22. 

He is allowed to continue to serve as a judge because he has not been charged with any felonies, lohud.com reported. 

Lust's lawyer, Andrew Quinn, says prosecutors inaccurately characterized Lust as trying to trade on his judgeship.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Mr Lust on Tuesday.

Lust is one of Harrison's two part-time justices. He was first elected in 1999. He ran on both the Republican and Democratic lines in 2011.

He is also a partner at DOPF, P.C., a powerful defense litigation firm in New York City. He has been a trial lawyer for 28 years and normally defends medical malpractice, construction accident and trucking litigation.

Mr Lust is married and has three children, two sons and one daughter, according to records.
