An Irish company has created huge excitement among investors after speculation that it could have discovered what could be the biggest oil find of its type in US history.

U.S. Oil and Gas, of Dublin, has been using ‘groundbreaking’ technologies for its first major drilling project in Hot Creek Valley, Nevada, with local media suggesting it is sitting on an enormous oil lake.

One well could generate a breathtaking 187million barrels of oil, reports suggested - although the company has insisted testing is not yet complete and the size of the oil field is not yet certain.

Testing: Research has been carried out in an area named Eblana 1, or 'Nelly', which is adjacent to oil-rich Railroad Valley, which was the most productive oil well in the US for a decade

‘We are looking at two oil systems: light sweet crude with gas condensate and the normal heavier oil that is found in Nevada,’ U.S. Oil and Gas CEO Brian McDonnell told Las Vegas channel KLAS-TV.

‘What we would need to do is a number of wells to actually define the geological structure and how much oil would be maintained in the geological structure. One well is not enough.’

Oil experts believe the product must have seeped in from elsewhere and say that if the discovery proves to be correct, it would deliver a mammoth boost to Nevada’s struggling economy.

‘In my opinion, Nevada will be the 
largest oil state ever to have happened in the U.S., including Texas and
 California,’ oil exploration expert Chuck Laser told KLAS-TV in a 
bullish prediction.

U.S. Oil and Gas is said to have leased 
25,000 acres in the valley - and legal disclosures made to investors 
caused the company’s share price to rise by 1,000 per cent.

But a statement on the firm's website said: ‘The company wishes to emphasise that testing is not yet complete, and no interim results or information have been communicated to any third party.

‘When testing and analysis is complete, the market will be informed of the results via the company's regulatory news service.’

The firm used techniques developed by oil expert Karim Akrawi, which included 3D imaging and sonic screening to identify the best drilling area. Mr Akrawi said he is ‘very, very positive’ about the find.

Some investors have claimed the lofty projections seem improbable - but many are waiting for a more detailed announcement from the company, which is expected later this month, reported KLAS-TV.
