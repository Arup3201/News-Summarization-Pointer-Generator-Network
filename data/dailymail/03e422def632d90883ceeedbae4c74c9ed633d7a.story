Britain has become so reliant on imports that the country would run out of food today if we only had UK-grown produce to eat.

Our farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food we consume - meaning that if our import supply was cut off we could only feed the nation until August 7 each year.

Agricultural self-sufficiency has fallen 15 percentage points from 75 per cent in 1991, according to Government figures.

Farming leaders insist they have the capacity to boost production, but they say they need the support of politicians, retailers and consumers to ensure increasing demand.

The National Farmers Union last night called for a coherent plan to boost agriculture, including better promotion of homegrown food, more tax breaks for farmers and better support from supermarkets.

NFU president Meurig Raymond said last night: ‘If we were completely reliant on British food the larder would be empty tomorrow, that is a quite scary thought and should be a wake-up call for society.

‘Farmers react to markets, they react to confidence levels, they are willing to invest in the future if they have that confidence.

‘Otherwise we will end up with 70 million people in the UK, only able to produce half of the food we need.

‘We need to ratchet up our ability to produce.

‘We need to sit down and develop a growth plan because the industry is going to require a huge level of investment in the years to come.’

Successive Governments have tried - and failed - to tackle the slide in farming production.

Ministers are worried not only about the impact on UK agriculture, but also about being too reliant on inconsistent foreign food supplies and turbulent prices.

With a growing global population, the problem is only going to get worse as more people compete for resources.

Mr Raymond said: ‘Even though the latest figures are startling, British farming is a sector we can be proud of. It produces the raw ingredients for the £97billion UK food and drink industry.

‘But the trade gap is widening – while our export performance has doubled in the last decade, we are spending £21.3billion more on imports than we are receiving from exports – up from £10.2billion in 1991.

‘What needs to happen now is for us as a country is to give farmers the green light to produce more food for us.

‘Our aim is to ensure the country - consumers, politicians, retailers and the wider food industry - is backing British farming, and within this, a solid plan for agricultural growth to ensure the current self-sufficiency trend is reversed and long-term food security is supported.’

The British record is poor when compared to other nations.

While we produce just 60 per cent of our needs, other developed nations manage to feed their populations while maintaining high exports.

Australia, for example, produces more than 170 per cent of the food it needs, the US about 120 per cent and France 110 per cent.

Part of the problem is that Britain does not just ship in exotic produce such as bananas and pineapples, but also buys in cheaper varieties of food we could produce perfectly well in this country.

It means that food such as French apples, Spanish cucumbers, Danish bacon and Mexican runner beans fill our supermarket shelves, even in the spring and summer months.

Last year we imported 27 per cent of food that could have been produced domestically, up from 23 per cent the year before, and 13 per cent in 1991.

In a bid to tackle the problem, the Government last month announced that the Armed Forces and all Whitehall departments will now buy British food where possible, even if it is more expensive, and schools and hospitals will be expected to follow suit.

Successive opinion polls have shown that shoppers would prefer to buy British where possible, but farmers complain that unclear labelling and marketing makes it difficult for them to do so.

Last month, for example, Tesco was criticised for promoting New Zealand lamb at the very time when British lamb is at its very best.

The NFU wants to see a plan which will include financial measures to boost on-farm investment in machinery and infrastructure such as water storage and buildings.

It would also include measures to improve access to new crops, biotechnology and growing systems, and for fair, transparent supply chains and secure returns from processors, retailers and caterers.

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We continue to work with industry and support UK producers to help boost food production - this includes our £160 million Agri-tech Strategy, driving innovation in farming and developing new resilient varieties of crops, and our plan to see the public sector sourcing £400 million pounds worth of food from the UK that they currently import.’
