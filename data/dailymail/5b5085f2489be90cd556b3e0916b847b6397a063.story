Paul Pogba has left the door open for a dramatic return to  Manchester United, revealing he still loves the club he left for Juventus  in 2012.

With   Europe's top teams planning a raid on the Serie A leaders for the France midfielder, Pogba hinted he has unfinished business at Old Trafford and holds no bad feelings after leaving on a free transfer due to a lack of opportunities.

'I'm impatient,' Pogba said in the latest FourFourTwo magazine about his exit. 'It was the feeling I had. The coach (Sir Alex Ferguson) had faith in me but didn't put me on. He said that I was too young.

'He said "your time will come" but it never did. It didn't come. But it does not mean I will speak ill of Manchester United. I love the club.'

In October, the 21-year-old penned a new contract with the Italian champions until June 2019 but the deal, worth a reported £70,000-a-week, has not been enough to stifle speculation of a move away from Italy.

The Frenchman has been linked with Chelsea and Manchester City, as well as Real Madrid but his agent, Mino Raiola, confessed it would take a big offer to entice Juve into talks regarding a transfer.

'Is Pogba's price tag around €80million (£66m)? He is one of the most expensive players on the market,' Raiola told Italian radio broadcaster RAI Sport. 'Considering his age, he has room for improvement and he is among the best. Of course, the asking price always depends on eventual buyers.'

When asked about Pogba's future, Juve general director Giuseppe Marotta told Sky Italia: 'What was a promising player has become a reality. Every European club is watching him and have been in contact with us.

'We, however, want to have a strong team made up of champions. We have an important player in Pogba and we don't have a need to sell him.'
