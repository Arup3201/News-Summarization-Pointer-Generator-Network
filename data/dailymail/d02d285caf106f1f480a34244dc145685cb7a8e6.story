The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola. 

Ernest Koroma has ordered the entire population into lock down from 6am on March 27 until 6pm on March 29. 

It comes as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - which have been the centres of the outbreak which has killed more than 10,000 people - have set a goal of cutting off the disease's spread by April 16.

Koroma said: 'All Sierra Leoneans must stay at home for three days,' he announced, expanding a previous order for a lockdown in the capital Freetown and northern areas of the country nationwide.

'I have made my personal commitment to do whatever it takes to get to zero Ebola infections and I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together,' he added.

Liberia had previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic in the country but a new case appeared in its capital Monrovia on Friday.

The infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease, it has been reported.

One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms, such as fever or vomiting.

The World Health Organization said Ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured.

'The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone,' President Koroma said. 

'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake.'
