Following England's earliest exit from a World Cup since 1958, former players and managers have been queuing up to add their opinion to the inquest that will inevitably begin when the Three Lions return from Brazil.

Successive 2-1 losses to Italy and Uruguay leave England bottom of Group D and already eliminated from the tournament, despite having a match against Costa Rica still to play on Tuesday.

Among some of the suggestions offered to ready the Three Lions for future tournaments are that English players need to learn to play alternative formations, the FA need to produce a greater number of coaches, and England must make sure their best XI players take to the field.

All alone: Roy Hodgson's position has come under question following England's elimination in Brazil

Clinical: Luis Suarez's brace ensured England exited the World Cup at the earliest stage since 1958

Tactics: England players' naivety when it comes to differing formations may have cost them in Brazil

Sven Goran Eriksson

‘Roy Hodgson stays because he is an Englishman,' the former England manager told Swedish newspaper SportExpressn.

'Had he been a foreigner, there is not a chance he would have been left in the job.

‘When I was with England, expectations were that we would get to the semi-finals and finals.’

David James

‘It isn’t a case of under-performing. We are simply not good enough,’ the ex-England goalkeeper told The Observer.

‘You look around the dining table on an England camp and you want to see winners and there are very few.

'Certainly Greg Dyke’s notion of winning the World Cup in 2022 seems more far-fetched than ever.’

Patrick Vieira

‘The English need to accept the modern way of playing and that means developing tactically,' the former France captain told the Sunday Times.

'Other countries try different things, three at the back, other formations, but English players don’t get used to different systems and situations.

Rio Ferdinand

‘England’s embarrassing early exit from the World Cup needs to be a wake-up call that something is fundamentally wrong in our national game and it needs fixing or we’ll be also-rans for ever,’ said Ferdinand in his Mail on Sunday column.

‘We have too few coaches... Coaching is respected elsewhere, valued. In England it’s vocational, a hobby.’

Terry Butcher

‘There has to be a huge swing in mentality of our players at international level,’ said the former England defender in the Sunday Mirror.

‘It’s no good meeting up at St George’s Park and trying to create a club atmosphere because playing for England is more than that.’

Attitude: Terry Butcher believes a change in mentality is needed for England to improve

Tony Adams

‘Roy Hodgson left his best defence at home,' the former England international said in the Sunday Telegraph.

'The most experienced and best centre half in the country, John Terry, was not picked while Ashley Cole should have travelled.

‘Hodgson’s philosophy was very naive. Tactically England were in a mess.’
