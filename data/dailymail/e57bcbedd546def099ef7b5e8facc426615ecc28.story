Cocaine addict Samantha Sumsion, 21, attacked a disabled grandmother on her doorstep in Brierfield, near Burnley 

A cocaine addict asked a disabled Good Samaritan for help by claiming she had been the victim of domestic violence before attacking her in a cowardly doorstep robbery.

Samantha Sumsion, 21, turned up at Linda Sutcliffe's door in Brierfield, near Burnley, claiming she was upset after a row with her boyfriend.

The 55-year-old grandmother let Sumsion into her home and told her to return if she needed any further help.

Just 15 minutes later, Sumsion turned up again at the victim's house. But this time, Sumsion punched her to the ground, before grabbing her by the shoulders and kneeing her in the face.

Sumsion's former boyfriend Munir Hussain then held down the terrified victim while Sumsion stole the victim's mobile phone from her front room.

The former drug addict has now been jailed for three years after pleading guilty at Burnley Crown Court to one charge of robbery.

The defendant, also from Brierfield, broke down in tears as she was led from the dock sobbing, before shouting 'I love you' to current partner Ben Allen, who was sat in the public gallery.   

The court heard how the attack had left the victim so frightened that she has been unable to sleep or leave her home.

Mrs Sutcliffe - who has several medical conditions, including a brain aneurysm - has since moved to a new address following the terrifying ordeal.  

Prosecutor Brian McKenna told the court how Mrs Sutcliffe was at home in October last year when Hussain knocked on her door.

He told the court: `She (Mrs Sutcliffe) didn't know him, but he asked her to ring the police because he had been arguing with his girlfriend and was saying she was trying to get him into trouble.'

Sumsion then appeared at the victim's door, appearing to be distressed and shaken up, the court was told. 

Despite not knowing the victim, Mrs Sutcliffe believed she needed help and let her into her home, before closing the front door to stop Hussain following.

Mr McKenna said Sumsion then stayed at Mrs Sutcliffe's home for around 30 minutes, talking to her about the alleged row.

Before Sumsion left, the pair even came up with a plan for her to knock three times on the door if she needed to return to Mrs Sutcliffe's home, so she knew who it was.

About 15 minutes later, there was another knock at the door. Sumsion was again there with Hussain, the court was told.

Mr McKenna said: 'Mrs Sutcliffe says the defendant looked straight at her and punched her in the face with a clenched fist. That caused her to stumble backwards and she fell to her knees.

'Sumsion then ran into to the vestibule area and into the living room. Mrs Sutcliffe tried to get up to go after her, but Hussain, on two occasions, pulled her back, restraining her by her shoulders.'  

After she was arrested, Sumsion denied being the robber, but she was picked out by the victim during an identification parade.

The court heard how she later claimed she was addicted to crack cocaine and Hussain had been habitually violent to her. 

She also claimed her initial visit to Mrs Sutcliffe's had been a 'genuine attempt to escape as she has just been abused', the court was told. 

But she claims that, when she returned to the home she shared with Hussain, he allegedly interrogated her about where she had been.

When she told him the story, he then asked if there had been any items of value at the victim's home, she claims. 

Mr McKenna added: 'She does accept she had noticed a mobile phone and mentioned this to Mr Hussain.

'He insisted she return to steal the telephone and threatened her with further violence if she refused to co-operate.'

Mr McKenna told the court how Sumsion claimed Hussain sold the phone for £100 and went off to buy crack cocaine. When she returned home, she was arrested.

The court also heard victim impact statements from Mrs Sutcliffe, which told how she had been 'terrified' since the robbery.

Sumsion claims she was forced to carry out the robbery by her former boyfriend and had initially gone to Mrs Sutcliffe's house in a 'genuine attempt' to escape from him 

Mr McKenna told the court: 'She is unable to sleep at all at night. She's afraid to go out of her house and has started to block the bedroom door when she goes to bed.

'She has been to her doctor for medication for her inability to sleep but he has been unable to prescribe anything because of the medication she takes.'

The prosecutor added that, in a more recent statement, Mrs Sutcliffe described how she had felt like a recluse in her own home. She had since saved up and had moved to a new address.

He continued: 'She says the robbery has changed her as a person, as previously she would help anyone, as she tried to help the defendant, but since then she has been reluctant to help again because of what happened to her on this occasion.'

The court heard how Sumsion had a criminal record going back to 2011, with previous convictions for being drunk and disorderly, public disorder, police assault, battery, intimidation and assault.

Her lawyer James Heyworth said Sumsion clearly had a good upbringing, but that her life had taken a different direction when she turned 14, partly due to her relationship with Hussain.  

Mr Heyworth added: 'But for the intervention of Munir Hussain, it may be a reasonable inference, she would not have gone back to that address to commit the offence.

'He clearly wanted something he could sell quickly to fund his own addiction and she ultimately went along with that.

'She was cajoled to go back there and she decided to assault and steal from the complainant very much with his assistance. Fortunately for her, and no doubt for society at large, she's no longer in any relationship at all with Munir Hussain.'

Mr Heyworth said Sumsion was now in a stable relationship with Mr Allen, adding: 'She no longer uses drugs and is clean of Class A drugs. She ultimately took it upon herself to go cold turkey from Class A drugs. She does now very much seem to have turned her life around.'

Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson told Sumsion: 'This was a robbery of a lady, who, earlier in the day, had shown you nothing but kindness.

'The effect on the victim is immense as we have heard from her victim impact statements. One of the phrases she uses was: "This was a life-changing experience".'
