When 17-year-old Kurt Coleman walks past his own reflection he stops in awe to look at the teenager staring back at him.

But it's a trait his Mother has grown to love about her selfie obsessed son, who spends more time behind the camera and in front of a mirror than you care to imagine.

Speaking about the teenager, Maureen Coleman has delved into the private life of a very public teenager who in an interview with New Idea told the magazine about the bullying which forced him to drop out of school.

'Gorgeous boy' Maureen Coleman regularly poses up for selfies with her proud son Kurt, who claims to have posted more than 100,000 selfies online

'it hasn't been easy for Kurt' Maureen Coleman says her son has been taunted online because of his overtly confident ways

But apart from a few online taunts, which his mother said he has learnt to rise above, it it has been a largely fruitful rise to stardom for the online wonder kid who is now under the wing of a full time publicist.

It is claims such as the one where he declared himself god's gift to earth and that he is Australia's answer to Paris Hilton which has raised his teenage profile.

Given his popularity online, he said he was once asked if his online profile was an invented character or if he really does love himself.

Kurt replied: 'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong.' He said his confidence was not hiding any insecurities ... 'I do love myself.'

He said it: Kurt Coleman has declared that he is a bigger than life itself

And his Gold Coast mother, who has two other children, loves him just as much.

The hairdresser who features in some of the 100,000 photos he claims to have posted online, said she supports her boy's obscure and overtly confident outlook on life, adding the 17-year-old is a 'gorgeous boy with a beautiful heart.'

'Kurt loves who he is, he always says how good he looks and I think it's great at least he doesn't sit there and say how bad he looks,' she told MailOnline.

Naturally, comments such as the claim he is Australia's answer to Paris Hilton has elicited some strong reaction online, but Maureen supports her son's positive attitude and outgoing lifestyle.

'I don't really read it (nasty comments), Mrs Coleman said.

'I know there is some hate out there but that's their opinion. Kurt says the hate motivates him to keep doing what he does because he loves proving people wrong.'

She said it's 'disgusting' to see some of the things written about him. One commenter recently reacted to a photo posted to Facebook by calling him a 'fag'.

 'It hasn't been easy for Kurt, he was bullied at school and dropped out.'

'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong,' the 17-year-old doesn't hold back.

Kurt's mother said he spends hours in front of the camera fine-tuning and admiring his obsessive look

She said although he has his detractors, there's plenty of positive things being said about the 17-year-old.

'I do hairdressing and when some customers find out that I'm Kurt Coleman's mum, they freak out,' she said. 'One time I was cutting one of my friend's daughters hair and she wrote on Facebook 'Kurt Coleman's mum breathed on me!' it was so funny.'

While she still finds it hard to comprehend just how popular he has become, Mrs Coleman said she has always encouraged her boy to 'dream big.'

'I'm not surprised he has become successful, I've always told him to dream big.'

She said she thought Kurt might one day find himself in the spotlight, but didn't expect it to come via social media - a tool which he has taken too with keen interest.

'I didn't ever think it would be from social media but I knew he would end up on TV because he has always been in front of the camera,' she said.'

Even when he was really young he would make me buy him cameras for Christmas and birthdays and take photos and videos of himself all day. I'm very proud of him and everything his done.'

Among his most incredible public claims, Kurt once said the only reason he remains single is because 'he loves himself too much' and noone else is 'good enough for me.'

'The lunar eclipse is almost as perfect as me.' Kurt Coleman has photo shopped a variety of different photos and posted them to social media

But while this kind of self-delusional attitude has rustled the feathers of  many active people on social media, the one woman closer to him than any other said there's never a dull moment when he's around.

She said on one occasion she came home to find him re-arranging his room to have the end of his bed facing the mirror. His reason? so that when he woke up the first person he saw was himself.

And some more trivia about the 17-year-old you probably don't already know, courtesy of his mum, is that he he's 'addicted to eating chocolate.'

Did we mention he also loves spray tans?

She said: 'Kurt's always testing out different spray tans that he gets sent from companies which makes for some interesting looking sheets and towels. Sometimes when he comes home his spray tan is so dark and we just laugh about it for hours.'
