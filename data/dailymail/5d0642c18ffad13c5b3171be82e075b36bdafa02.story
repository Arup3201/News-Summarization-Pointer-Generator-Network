The teenager who sparked fury across the Internet by posting a video of himself kicking a kitten off his porch has been charged with animal cruelty.

The arrest of Walter Easley, 17, of Cordova, South Carolina, followed a campaign by users of the controversial image board 4chan to track him down.

He faces a misdemeanour charge of animal cruelty and a possible sentence of to up to 60 days in prison.

The video of Easley kicking the cat that was originally uploaded to Vine sparked fury among internet users

Easley rose to worldwide notoriety 
after last month posting a six-second video of himself kicking a tiny 
ginger kitten off his porch.

The clip shows Easley speaking to the camera before lining up the tiny ginger cat. He takes off his shoes before kicking the animal over his three porch steps and about 10ft into his garden.

In the video the kitten appears to be unharmed and stands up immediately after landing on the grass.

The clip soon spread to 4chan and Reddit where horrified Internet users
 lined up to pour condemnation and abuse - some of it racist - on the 
teenager.

The youth initially responded to the reaction on Twitter with the tweet: 'Lol now I got something to laugh at all day.'

But
 as the outrage grew, Easley deleted the clip from video-sharing service
 Vine after it went viral and also made his Twitter profile, 
@SuckMy_Walt, private, reported the Daily Dot.

By that time users of 4chan's random imageboard /b/ had begun a campaign to track down the youngster.

Somehow
 they managed to get hold of his address, mobile number and a link to 
his sister's Facebook page, which they published on two different 
Pastebin accounts.

The clip was also spread across Twitter, LiveLeak and YouTube where it was viewed hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of times.

Easley 
was arrested on Monday, reported South Carolina's Times and Democrat 
newspaper. The next day he faced a county magistrate where he was 
formally charged with cruelty to animals.

Officials
 from Orangeburg County Animal Control examined the animal, which was 
not reported to be injured and other animals at Easley's home were taken
 into custody as well.

Controversial imageboard 4chan, a favourite web hangout for Internet trolls, is not well known for its good deeds.

Users
 have in the past egged each other on to raid the Facebook remembrance 
page of a dead teenager with abusive messages, targeted a Welsh woman 
who launched her own campaign against Internet trolls and, hilariously, 
gamed TIME magazine's Person of the Year poll to secure victory for 
young North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

However,
 as the Daily Dot notes, users of the site's /b/ board did in 2011 help 
track down a Texas judge caught on video whipping his disabled daughter 
and, this past July, helped get an Australian man banned from his gym 
after he photographed people working out and posted the pictures to 
Facebook to mock them.

Since the video went viral, Easley has been subjected to threats and racist abuse online

According
 an Orangeburg County incident report, seen by the Times and Democrat, 
Easley told police the video had been edited to make it look more 
extreme.

He is said to have
 told police and Animal Control officers that he was 'hanging with some 
friends' when they came up with the idea after watching a stand-up 
routine by comedian Kevin Hart.

Easley's next court date is scheduled for September 12.
