At least 1,000 people will be summoned as potential jurors for the trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a federal judge said today.

Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with carrying out the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He has pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if convicted.

The former University of Massachusetts student is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line with the help of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who later died in a shootout with police.

Judge George O'Toole Jr said he expects a pool of 1,000 potential jurors to be called in to fill out questionnaires for Tasarnaev's case to ensure that an impartial jury can be picked.

Boston Marathon bombing suspect: At least 1,000 people will be summoned to pick a jury for the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (pictured), a federal judgesaid today. They will be whittled down to 100, then 12

Attack: Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He allegedly planted two bombs near the marathon finish line. Above, one of the bombs explodes

They will then be being whittled down to around 100, who will be questioned individually. Finally, the jury of 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen from the group.

''It's kind of a rolling admission policy,' O'Toole told USA Today.

Earlier this year, defense attorneys petitioned O'Toole to relocate the suspect's trial on the grounds that sourcing impartial jurors in Boston would be impossible. 

But the judge ruled  that the trial would go forward in the city despite the widespread impact of the bombings, saying the area is large enough to generate a sufficient pool of qualified jurors.

Speaking during a status conference in U.S. District Court today, O'Toole said jury selection is scheduled to begin on January 5. 

But he added that it could be delayed by one day if there are juries for other trials being picked on that date.

Tsarnaev, who was pictured wearing a white baseball cap at the scene of the bombing, is being held in a federal prison while awaiting trial. He did not attend Monday's status conference.

However, seven protesters stood outside the courthouse holding placards challenging the case against him. One of them, Karin Friedman, called the evidence against Tsarnaev 'flimsy'.

Another woman who identified herself as the mother-in-law of Ibragim Todashev, who was shot by the FBI while being questioned about Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, was also stood outside.

The woman, named Elena Teyer, said she drove two days from her home in Georgia to reach the courthouse. She was holding a placard with photos of Todashev, alongside the words: 'I am dead because I knew Tsarnaevs. I knew the truth.'

Todashev was killed in May 2013 - around a month after the bombings on April 15 - while being questioned about a triple slaying in Waltham in 2011.

Federal authorities have said that Todashev implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the triple slaying. Authorities cleared the agent, saying Todashev had charged at a Massachusetts state trooper.

Tsarnaev, who is legally allowed to skip pre-trial hearings, has missed every one since his arraignment in July 2013.

His attorneys, alongside prosecution lawyers, will be back in court at least twice before the trial begins. Status conferences are scheduled for November 12 and December 18.
