Rob Dennis, 27, was issued a five-match ban and told to attend an educational course for his comment that the referee was foreign

A goalkeeper was given an eight-match ban and told to attend an anti-racism course by the FA after allegedly calling a Polish referee foreign. 

Rob Dennis was sent off while playing for Sandiacre Town in Derby for a tackle which left his opponent with a broken leg.

When his team urged the referee, a Polish national, to reconsider, the 27-year-old said he was overheard commenting that it was unlikely the referee would change his mind and that he was foreign.

His comments were reported to the FA and deemed an aggravated breach of rules. 

As a result Mr Dennis, a father-of-two, was given a three-month ban and told to attend an anti-racism course. 

He was previously given a three-match ban and fined £75 for the tackle which saw him sent off the pitch. 

While he hasn't appealed the FA's ruling, the footballer said he feels as though he has been unfairly accused of racism.  

'What I meant was I knew the ref and he wouldn't reverse the decision,' he told the Sun. 

'I'm shocked and upset to be called racist. I'm not.' 

This morning the FA confirmed the case had been considered an aggravated breach of FA rules on the basis of racial discrimination.

As laid out by the most recent guidelines, such breaches incur a five-match ban and compulsory education course. 

A spokesman for the FA told MailOnline: 'An investigation was launched following receipt of a referee’s report by Derbyshire County FA which referred to an incident at the end of a game between Sandiacre Town and Wirksworth Town in the Midlands Regional Alliance League on April 5, 2014.

'Following an investigation, Rob Dennis was charged for an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3. 

'Mr Dennis denied the charge but was found guilty by an independent commission following a hearing in December.

The 27-year-old was given a five-match ban for the incident which occurred while he was playing for Sandiacre Town FC, based out of St Giles Park in Nottingham (pictured)

'Aggravated breaches of this nature carry an automatic five-match suspension. The automatic sanction was added to the automatic three match suspension that the player received for his dismissal for serious foul play resulting in a total suspension of 8 matches for two separate offences. 

'The player did not appeal the sanction imposed.'

Others to have been enrolled in the past include  Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan who is alleged to have claimed that Jews 'chase money' in an interview.

Footballer Mario Balotelli was also told to attend the course after posting a controversial photograph on social media site Instagram. 

The image, since removed, depicted the video game character Super Mario, accompanied with the words: 'jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.'

He was issued a £25,000 fine for the post last year.
