A cab driving Iraq war veteran and Army reservist says a customer beat and injured him for his Muslim beliefs and caught the fight leading up to the attack on video.

‘I love this country,’ Salim told the Washington Post. ‘I didn’t deserve this.’

Salim, who is a sergeant in the Army Reserves and did a tour of duty in Iraq said he had a bad feeling about the passenger he picked up in the early morning hours April 26 at the Fairfax Country Club in the tony suburbs of Washington, DC.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Targeted? Mohamed Salim, a Northern Virginia cab driver, says a customer assaulted him after a heated conversation about Salim's Muslim beliefs

The 39-year-old father of four had such a bad feeling, he says, that he started taping their conversation with his cell phone.

‘I suspected the guy was going to make trouble,’ Salim said.

Heated: Grainy cell phone footage shows Ed Dahlberg, pictured, become incited by Salim's Muslim background

As soon as the footage begins, passenger Ed Dahlberg wanting to talk about Salim’s background.

Dahlberg asked him where he is from and if he is Muslim. Salim is, in fact, Muslim, and was born in Somalia.

‘What do you think about jihad,’ is what Dahlberg, who Salim says had been drinking, asked next. From there the dialog became more heated.

Salim explained to Dahlberg what he believes jihad to mean and Dahlberg became angry.

‘Now you asked me a question and now you are putting a word in my mouth and now you are judging me,’ Salim said.

‘I am judging you,’ Dahlberg responded, eventually calling Salim a ‘expletive Jihadist.’

At the end of the footage, Salim showed Dahlberg his cell phone and told him he was being taped, at which point Dahlberg appeared to smack the phone away from Salim.

What happened after that remains between the two men. You can watch the video, which the Washington Post is running exclusively, here.

Hate? Salim speaks to the press with the Council for American-Islamic Relations on Monday. The group asked that Dahlberg be cahrged with a hate crime

Dahlberg’s attorney, Demetry Pikrallidas, said Dahlberg, who has been charged with misdemeanor assault, did not punch Salim.

Salim claims Dahlberg compared him to the Boston bombers and threatened to kill him in addition to punching him in the jaw when the phone was no longer capturing video.

A medical report reveals the three hours after the incident, Salim sought emergency care for a fractured jaw.Pikrallidas called Dahlberg, who asserts in the video that he owns his own aviation company, a ‘hardworking family man and a church-going person.’

Washington’s Muslim rights group Council on American-Islamic relations asked Fairfax County prosecutors on Monday to designate the attack a hate crime to ‘send a message that anti-Muslim crime will not be tolerated.’

If labelled a hate crime, Dahlberg’s misdemeanor charge will become a felony charge.

Upsetting: Samil, here with a CAIR representative, told reporters, 'i love this country. I don't deserve this.'
