A terminally ill woman claims NHS doctors failed to diagnose her pancreatic cancer, despite 19 appointments.

Julia Rogers, 58, from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had an inoperable pancreatic tumour after she went to a private hospital and paid £600 for a scan.

NHS England has launched an inquiry to determined what happened.

In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her 
GP complaining of severe back pain, which she said felt like it was 
spreading to her abdomen.

She had blood tests and was later sent for an ultrasound at Totnes Community Hospital, but nothing unusual was seen on the scan.

The test was not repeated, despite Ms Rogers’ pancreas being obscured at the time because of ‘excessive bowel gas’.

For the past nine months, she has experienced severe pain and visited doctors 17 times.

Between
 October and June Ms Rogers made two trips to Torbay Hospital’s accident
 and emergency department and on one occasion was sent home with 
painkillers.

On June 11 Ms Rogers was told she had 'inoperable' advanced pancreatic cancer (illustrated). 'You either throw the towel in and give up or you fight and for me there is only one option,' she said

Around 8,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer every year, of whom fewer than four per cent are likely to live five years.

It is the ninth most common cancer in the UK and tends to affect people over the age of 60.

Pancreatic cancer is when a tumour starts to develop in the pancreas. It rarely causes any symptoms when it first develops, which can make it hard to diagnose.

The first symptoms include: pain, unexpected weight loss and jaundice.

Cancer of the pancreas is a very serious form of cancer which is both difficult to detect and treat.

Surgery to remove the tumour is usually the only way to completely cure pancreatic cancer. But this is a suitable treatment for only around 15 to 20 per cent of patients.

A study by Cancer Research UK recently revealed that 37 per cent of people with the disease could have saved themselves by maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking.

She told the BBC’s Sally Mountjoy: ‘I still knew something was very wrong.

‘I could not get any of the doctors to take me seriously.

'Urgency was totally lacking. I’ve been let down and I’m devastated.’

Ms Rogers was referred to an appointment with a gastroenterologist but decided she could not wait several weeks and paid £600 to have a scan at a private hospital in Bristol.

On June 11 she was told she had ‘inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer’.

‘You either throw the towel in and give up or you fight and for me there is only one option,’ she said.

Ms Rogers said that since she was diagnosed, it has been a-day-by-day battle to find out when she would start chemotherapy.

She was admitted to hospital over the weekend and expects to undergo treatment this week.

In a statement, NHS England, on behalf of South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, Totnes Community Hospital and South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about Ms Rogers’ diagnosis and the difficulties she seems to have encountered over an extended period.

‘This clearly calls for thorough investigation on behalf of all NHS organisations involved.

‘We will be seeking an early meeting with Mrs Rogers to understand her concerns more fully.’

Dr Graham Lockerbie, the medical director for NHS England in the South West will be leading the investigation.

In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her GP complaining of severe back pain. But an ultrasound did not reveal a problem, leaving her in pain and visiting the doctors 17 times between October and June. It was not until she paid £600 for a scan at a private hospital in Bristol that she found she has inoperable pancreatic cancer. Magnified pancreatic cancer cells are pictured

A woman who claims doctors failed to diagnose her terminal cancer 16 times, raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany as she prepares to take legal action against the NHS.

Leigh Naylor was distraught when medics revealed they had found cervical tumour, giving her nine months to live in March.

The 32-year-old raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany, after doctors in the UK said all they could offer was a course of life-prolonging chemotherapy.

After three weeks of treatment, Mrs Naylor said her tumour has shrunk and she is starting to show signs of recovery.

But she has been forced to return to the UK after her money ran out, and is trying to raise a further £12,000 for each course of treatment, which she may need for the rest of her life.

Mrs Naylor visited her GP with irregular bleeding in April 2009 and saw her doctor 16 times in the space of 18 months. She claims she was only given tablets to stop the bleeding.

Mrs Naylor said an ultrasound scan revealed she had fibroids - non-cancerous tumours around the womb.

Just three weeks after a routine operation to remove the fibroids, doctors at Leeds' St James Hospital admitted they had failed to spot a cancerous tumour, Mrs Naylor claimed.

Following treatment, the 32-year-old was given the all-clear in April 2010, but in September 2012, she went back to doctors complaining of further pain. She said doctors sent her away with antibiotics.

Once more, she asked for a scan and seven months of tests revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable. She was a given just nine months to live in March this year.

Refusing to accept the outcome, Mrs Naylor raised £35,000 to travel to Marinus Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, where she had three weeks of treatment, involving heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin C injections to boost her immune system.

German doctors told Mrs Naylor that she is responding well to treatment and hope that the tumour will continue to shrink.
