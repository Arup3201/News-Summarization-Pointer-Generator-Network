She was captured ‘photo-bombing’ two Commonwealth Games athletes over the summer and has even posed for her first ‘selfie’.

But the Queen has confided that she actually finds the phenomena of people filming her on their mobile phones rather ‘strange’.

Never one to get on her soapbox, her feelings on the subject have, however, been made public by the US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun.

The Queen confided in the US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun, that she finds it 'strange' with 'crowds all standing there holding up their mobile phones' 

The 43-year-old diplomat, tipped as a future American president, told this month’s Tatler magazine that he was invited, along with his wife, to Buckingham Palace when they arrived in the UK last year.

He recalled how they had a ‘nice chat’ with the Queen, who told them ‘how strange she finds it these days, with the crowds all standing there holding up their mobile phones’.

‘She was essentially saying, ‘I miss eye contact,’ Mr Barzun told the magazine.

The 88-year-old sovereign is by no means a Luddite – owning a mobile phone and an iPod on which, it is said, staff download The Proms for her to listen to.

She and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 93, are also said to be surprisingly computer literate.

But according to senior royal sources the Queen does find the trend for members of the public to stand close up and attempt to film their encounters with her ‘not a little disconcerting’.

On her recent state visit to Paris, it is understood that some over-excited members of the public had to be physically restrained as they rushed forward, camera phones brandished, to photograph and video her.

Similarly, when members of the Royal Family go on walkabouts it is not uncommon for people chatting to them to push a camera-phone in their face and simultaneously film the encounter.

Other members of the Royal Family have also openly spoken about their antipathy to social media, on which many of these pictures are posted.

Harry, 29, recently admitted to a class teaching teenagers how to use social media to promote charity work: ‘I really quite hate Twitter’. The prince said he felt pictures and information about his movements that were regularly shared on the site as an invasion of his privacy.

On the whole, however, most royals are happy to play along.

The Queen was declared to have carried out the ‘best photo-bomb in history’ when she walked, smiling, into a shot being taken by two Australian hockey players at the Commonwealth Games earlier this summer.

Jayde Taylor was posing for a photo with team-mate Brooke Peris when the radiant Queen appeared in the background over her shoulder.

The hockey player then posted the picture on Twitter, where it was retweeted thousands of times with the hashtag #queenselfie.

Prince Harry showed he was an equally good sport at the Games when he leant over and gave a cheeky thumbs-up in the back of a shot of New Zealand team officials.

Other members of the Royal Family to have posed for selfie-style shots include Prince Charles and Prince William.

Last year Brownie Jessica Fitch couldn’t believe her luck when she persuaded not only the Queen but Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to each pose for photographs with her battered old bear, Bertie.

The gutsy seven-year-old, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was at a Buckingham Palace event when she secured her unprecedented royal hat trick.

The secret to her success, however, was not that she thrust a phone in the monarch’s face - but that she asked her politely.

‘She held up Bertie towards the Queen so I just said without thinking: ‘Ma’am’, would you mind posing for a picture with Bertie bear from our Brownie group?’ ‘ said her father, Michael.

Jessica continued: ‘The Queen looked at Bertie’s uniform and smiled and asked me : ‘Are you a Brownie?’

‘Then I said, in a very posh voice, ‘Yes I am’. And she said ‘Yes, of course’.
