Comments: Damian Hinds said the UK lagged behind international competitors

Social mobility in Britain is the worst in the Western world and the gap between rich and poor has become ingrained in children as young as three, MPs conclude today.

They quote a study showing that the prospects of half of all children born in the UK can be almost entirely linked to the circumstances of their parents – compared to only 15 per cent of those in Denmark.

Differences are also noticeable at a very young age, with toddlers doing far better in vocabulary tests if they grow up in a more affluent household.

Controversially, the MPs call for more
 intervention in the lives of under-threes. The report also shows that 
despite all the money spent to get more teenagers into university, the 
access gap between rich and poor has actually widened in recent years.

Last
 night Tory backbencher Damian Hinds, chairman of the All-Party Group on
 Social Mobility, which wrote the report, said: ‘For a long time, we 
have lagged behind our international competitors in ensuring all Britons
 can realise their potential.

‘To
 bridge the gap will require a shared commitment between schools, 
universities and firms, government and the voluntary sector. The scale 
of the challenge is immense.’

The
 report quotes a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
 Development which compared the extent to which children’s prospects are
 predictable from parents’ circumstances.

In
 the UK, the OECD says 50 per cent of children’s prospects are 
predictable from the position of their parents – a sign of low social 
mobility. This was worse than Italy (48 per cent), the US (47 per cent) 
and  France (41 per cent).

The prospects of poorer children born in Australia (17 per cent) and Denmark (15 per cent) are much brighter.

Britain’s failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, the MPs say. The report makes it clear the differences become ingrained as young as the age of three.

Studies have shown that while only 42 per cent of parents in the poorest fifth of homes read to their children every day, 78 per cent of those in the richest fifth do so.

Wealthier parents are also more likely to send their children to bed at a regular time. It has led to richer children being more likely to be deemed ‘ready’ for school at three.

They also perform much better in vocabulary tests at five. Children from poorer households are more likely to be hyperactive.

The MPs called on the Government to consider ways of improving the education of those from poor backgrounds, such as means-testing fees at independent schools to get more poor people into top schools and sending more poor children to summer camps.

But it failed to mention either the return of grammar schools or the assisted-places scheme for poorer families, which was abolished by the last Labour government.

The MPs’ report concluded that the biggest impact on social mobility was the quality of parenting, whether the home environment was educational and whether the parents had good mental health.

It says: ‘A child’s development from zero to three is the point of greatest leverage for social mobility. It is acknowledged that this is difficult territory for policy makers as it relates to parenting as well as what happens in childcare and nursery settings.’

The conclusion will be controversial because it could be used to support greater ‘nanny state’ interference into families.

The MPs urged ministers to do more to encourage parents to read to children using techniques similar to the ‘five-a-day’ campaign which encourages people to eat more fruit and veg.

The study also found that the gap between rich and poor on university access has widened.

In 1981, children from the richest fifth of households were three times more likely than those from the poorest fifth to go to university. By the late 1990s, they were five times more likely to go.
