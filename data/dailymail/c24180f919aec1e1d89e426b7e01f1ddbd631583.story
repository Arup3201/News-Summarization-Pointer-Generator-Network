Dina Asher-Smith’s backpack is sagging under the weight of Early Modern Europe (medieval history) and several other hefty tomes but she bounces up the grand stone staircase at King’s College London, passing a pair of marble statues of the Greek dramatist Sophocles and philosopher Sappho.

The 19-year-old remarks excitedly that she chose to study here partly because of the air of consequence in the hallways. 

The history undergraduate had her pick of universities. A number of establishments tried to woo her to study in the United States because, as well as being a brilliant young academic, Asher-Smith is Britain’s fastest woman and one of the world’s top sprinting talents.

Dina Asher-Smith has been juggling her studies with her athletics - both of which she is excelling in

Winning 100 metre gold at the World Junior Championships in Oregon this summer by the biggest margin for 14 years alerted hundreds of university recruiters on the other side of the pond, where sporting prowess is prized above all. 

Asher-Smith was flattered but chose to remain at her training base in Bromley, south London.

‘Harvard University and Florida State showed interest,’ she says. ‘You get messages and emails from quite a lot of places. 

'But I want to do athletics and academics at a high standard and it’s hard to match up the two. At Harvard, athletics training might not be as high a standard as Florida State, where it’s not as good for studies.’

We are talking in the staff room of the Strand campus building after a morning of lectures and before she heads home to write an essay ahead of training at Blackheath and Bromley Athletics Club.

Asher-Smith is all smiles as she speaks to Sportsmail about her ambitions on and off the track

‘Today I did the Protestant Reformation,’ she says, ‘I do medieval history, early modern Europe and the British Empire. I like early modern history best, learning about the ideas of enlightenment and renaissance.

‘The volume of work is insane. I’m here three days a week and we have 200 pages of reading to do for each day. Then I have six training sessions a week.

‘I’m always quite tired, but I knew I had to be a bit more organised than most students. You can’t really afford to just sit there and sleep. 

'I’m paying £9,000 a year to be here so I can’t go to a seminar without doing my reading. Even if I don’t say much I want to know what they’re talking about.’

In one incredible day in August, Asher-Smith learned she had achieved the results required to get into King’s, a minimum of three As at A-level — she modestly refuses to reveal the exact results because she doesn’t want to look ‘big headed’.

She also set a new British junior 200m record of 22.61sec to get to the final at the European Championships in Zurich.

Her season ended abruptly as she broke down with a hamstring tear coming round the corner in the 200m final, but there was little wallowing time.

‘I couldn’t shed a tear because it was the day after results, I had modules to pick,’ she says. ‘If I’d just had athletics I might have been despairing.

‘Having two focuses you because it puts everything into perspective. Athletics is great but we are entertainers and the industry is fleeting. 

'You might be at the top of the country right now, but next year you could be injured or not performing. You’ve got something else to ground you and give you another possibility in life.’

Asher-Smith’s coach John Blackie, who claims she would have broken the junior 200m record again in the final but for her injury, has known Asher-Smith since she was eight.

He is happy she has decided to go to university but claims it can take athletes 18 months to get back on track. 

'Dina has reduced the potential obstacles by choosing to live at home so there won’t be the issue of diet changing. But there are small things like maybe she used to walk to school and now she doesn’t.

‘But this mix is definitely right for Dina. She’s very intelligent and needs to be exercising her brain to have that outlet. 

'Not to denigrate anyone else, but it’s helpful to have an intelligent athlete because they understand the reasons behind you doing certain things in training.’

Now in the thick of winter training, Asher-Smith has recovered from her hamstring injury and is ‘moving really fast’, according to Blackie. 

Her 100m personal best of 11.14sec achieved earlier this year puts her fourth on the British all-time list, behind Montell Douglas, Kathy Cook and Laura Turner-Alleyne.

With plenty of improvement still to be made, there are many who believe she could be Britain’s next big athletics star, including Pace Sports Management, the company which looks after Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, who rushed to add Asher-Smith to their books.

No longer a junior, Asher-Smith will focus on the Under 23 and senior championships next season, including the World Championships in Beijing. The Rio Olympics in 2016 is also on the horizon.

‘I set the bar quite high for myself but what other people think and expect goes straight in one ear and out of the other, not to be rude,’ she says, ‘I’m not the same as (Montell or Kathy). I might achieve the same or I might do more . . . ’

As she leaves to catch the bus, Asher-Smith strolls by the faces of notable alumni, including Olympic champion rower Katherine Grainger, printed on the side of the university building. 

You would not bet against Asher-Smith herself being up there one day.
