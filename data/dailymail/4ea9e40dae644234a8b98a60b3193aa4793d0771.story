An Italian greyhound that had been missing for eight months has found his way back to his southwestern Illinois home after he turned up hundreds of miles away in Virginia.

Five-year-old Dauz disappeared from the Dausman family's fenced Collinsville yard in July last year.

To the surprise of his heartbroken owners David, Alicia, and their two children David Jr., 3, and the dog's 'best friend' six-year-old Lilian, the pet traveled more than 900 miles to end up last month at an animal shelter in Fairfax.

'He's the same dog, but he won't let us out of his sight. As we will not, either,' said Alicia Dausman, 35.

The mother suspects Dauz, a purebred, was stolen by a friend's family member who was temporarily living with them, and that person took him to Virginia, according to Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis.

He was given to a man, who gifted the dog to his wife on her birthday. The couple, who called him 'Bruno,' took care of the pet but after a time he managed to escape and found his way to the shelter.

Ms Dausman said she tried everything she could think of to locate the dog, posting his picture on her Facebook page, submitting weekly Craigslist ads, and contacting shelters and Italian greyhound rescue groups.

Dauz was finally reunited after the Virginia shelter scanned the digital identification chip implanted in the dog's neck and notified the family, according to KDSK.com.

Ms Dausman said she couldn't believe her ears when the shelter called her, then the disbelief was replaced by elation that they would soon have their beloved pet back.

'I was so excited I had to pull over,' she told the news outlet. 'I got (Lilian) from school and she was walking down the hallway towards me. When I told her we found Dauz, she just stopped dead in her tracks.'

She said the animal shelter insisted the dog was in good shape suggesting someone had been taking care of him.

'But I just didn't get how he ended up 900 miles away,' she said.

The family was distraught when Dauz went missing last summer. After diligently searching for him in the yard and the surrounding neighborhood, Ms Dausman called police.

She said the loss of the pet hit hardest with Lilian who was just a year old when they bought the loving dog.

'She would just cry her eyes out,' the mother said of Lilian. 'She said, "Mom, I want my dog." And I had to say,"'Sorry, I don't know where he's at." I put his crate and toys downstairs. I couldn't even see a picture of him, I would cry. It hurt.'

Ms Dausman said she started to think finding Dauz wasn't going to happen, but Lilian always held out hope that he'd find his way home.

'Mom thought he was dead,' Lilian told the newspapers. 'I told her he was still alive.'

Ms Dausman said the microchip company, HomeAgain, transported Dauz back to Collinsville.And while he's thinner, lighter in color and has a raspier bark than before, he's still the same loveable pet.

'If there is one lesson to be learned, it's get your pets microchipped,' she said. 'And never give up. Miracles do happen.'
