Former President Bill Clinton's foundations spent a total of $50million on travel over the past decade, $12.1million of which was spent in just one year.

An internal investigation into spending at the various charities that the former President runs found that the funds used for travel costs have gone up in recent years.

The audit comes as new reports have revealed that the Clinton Foundation has been 'in the red' for years even though the charity has raised hundreds of millions of dollars each year, showing the high cost of running the worldwide charity.

Former President Bill Clinton called in a team of lawyers to help examine the charity's financial standing over a year ago and they drew some unsettling conclusions, and The New York Post reports that the internal audit documents point out their travel expenses as one costly factor.

Since Bill Clinton left office in 2000, he helped create a network of charities that have a worldwide and ever-changing list of causes, from helping Haiti after the earthquake to water cleaning practices in Africa.

The amount spent by each arm of the charities was broken down by The Post for 2011, which was the latest fiscal year where such data was available.

The Clinton Health Action Initiative was the biggest spender, paying $7.2million on travel in 2011, and the Clinton Foundation followed with $4.2million while the Clinton Global Health Initiative spent $730,000.

Big spending: Since 2003, Clinton's various charities have spent more than $50m in travel costs; the causes take him all over the globe, like to this school in Haiti where the Clinton Foundation launched a cholera awareness campaign in2011

Will travel: All of the foundations spent $12.1m in 2011, and ten percent of that was allotted to the former President's costs alone (seen here at a charity golf event that his Foundation sponsored with the PGA this January)

Of that $12.13million spent in 2011, 10 per cent was specified as being the cost of travel for the former President himself.

Though the total travel fees from 2010 are still unknown, the former President's costs took up more of the allotment as they represent 13 per cent of the fees.

Moving forward, the travel expenses for the former first family will only be growing as Chelsea joined the board of her father's charities in 2011.

Soon the overarching group is due to be renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

Their expenses are not the only ones who are getting some attention, as an earlier New York Times article told how the charity also paid for Academy Awards winner Natalie Portman to fly first class to an event in Austin, Texas, along with her pet dog.

After concerns were raised about how the 
charity's money was being spent, in 2012 Bill Clinton called in a team 
of lawyers to look over the finances and organization of the various 
branches of the charities to see if there was excess or inefficiencies.

New addition: Chelsea Clinton joined the board of her father's charities in 2011 so she is becoming a more frequent attendee on international visits- like this one to Cambodia in May of this year

Adding expertise: Chelsea used her consulting background to help root out inefficiencies in spending (seen with her father on the foundation-related trip to South Africa earlier this year)

Their findings showed that even though they raised $214million last year, they still had an $8million deficit because of earlier fundraising issues during the 2007-2008 recession.

Calling the meeting wasn’t the only way that the former President has had a hand in helping the group save money: it was revealed that he often also uses his billionaire friend’s private jets for certain long distance flights.

By using grocery-store magnate John Catsimatitis’ plane for trips- like his recent one with Chelsea to South Africa last month- the charities either pay a discounted rate to Catsimatitis or he writes the expense off as a charitable donation.

Such close ties to the Republican billionaire also shows another reason why the Clintons have been actively staying away from the ongoing New York City mayoral race, as Catsimatitis is running as a Republican against a number of Hillary Clinton’s former colleagues from her days in the Senate- not to mention her longtime aide Huma Abedin’s husband, Anthony Weiner.

In addition to being concerned about making the most of their fundraising money, there is also the very serious possibility that Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016 and if she does, her involvement in the charity will be carefully scrutinized.

Setting her sights: Since stepping down from the State Department, Hillary has become more active in her husband's charities but she may be leaving again to run for president in 2016
