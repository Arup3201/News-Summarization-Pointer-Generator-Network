A new portable razor aims to save women from those hairy situations when they realize they missed a spot shaving.

Leila Kashani, of Los Angeles, California, has created the Sphynx, a sleek, compact razor that includes soap, two blades and a refillable water container with a spray nozzle.

Ms Kashani, 29, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the product, which will be available to purchase for approximately $16.99 in April 2015.

Razor-sharp idea: The Sphynx, created by Leila Kashani, is a portable three-in-once device that includes two blades, soap and water for on-the-go shaving

The campaign officially ends on December 19, but she has already exceeded her goal of raising $25,000 by nearly $400.

'Too many times was I in situations where I was heading to the beach or traveling for work and realized that I missed a spot,' Ms Kashani says in a video on her Kickstarter page.

'I spent months researching razors that claimed to be on-the-go,' she adds.

Cutting edge: A model is seen using the product, which will be available for purchase in April 2005

'The ones that were small enough didn't include soap or water, which leads to razor burn. And the ones that did include it were definitely not purse-friendly.'

Ms Kashani spent 'countless nights' gluing and taping prototypes together and making pages of sketches before she came up with the Sphynx's clever design. 

She adds that its all-natural organic soap can be rubbed in like moisturizer after the shave, so there's no messy residue to rinse off.

In addition to the Sphynx's original black and white models, Ms Kashani plans to manufacture a colorful array of razors in bright patterns and shows 15 different versions on her website.

Refills will not be sold, so when the soap runs out and the blade becomes dull, customers will have to buy a replacement razor.

Ms Kashani told MailOnline that the idea for a discreet on-the-go razor first came to her when she was just a teenager.

'I was 13 years old, heading to the beach, and somehow missed a spot and didn't realize it till I got there. This is unfortunately something I still deal with to this day,' she said.

She added: 'I've heard so many people complain about a missed spot that it's what drove me to really bring Sphynx to life. I've also heard many scenarios where people avoided an activity because they weren't prepared for it. Even as simple as going to the gym after work because they didn't shave their underarms.'

Ms Kashani has worked in marketing for brands such as Nike and Columbia Sportswear since graduating from the University of California, San Diego in 2008.
