If you can’t stand the heat get out of the World Cup, to misquote Harry S Truman. Climate will have its say in Brazil in terms of preparation, tactics and the football, especially for European nations.

Salvador, Fortaleza, Natal and Recife are baked by fierce tropical heat and have seven lunchtime kick-offs, while Manaus steams in the relentless equatorial climate of the Amazon rainforest.

England play their opener against Italy there. They could be in Recife for the last 16 and Salvador or Fortaleza for a quarter-final, so much of Roy Hodgson’s early work in training has been done in fear of the mercury rising.

The link between hot and humid conditions and athletic performance is clinically proven.

HEAT AND PERFORMANCE

Fitness can be measured by the volume of oxygen your body can consume while exercising. When you see athletes on the treadmill wearing something that looks like a gas-mask, that’s what they’re measuring.

The masks link to computers which display a VO2 Max reading. Most footballers will be aware of their reading, which should be around 50, which represents 50 millilitres of oxygen per minute per kilo of bodyweight.

You increase it by exercising at 65-85 per cent of your maximum for at least 20 minutes, three or four times a week. Premier League clubs will usually test players three times a year: at the start of pre-season, midway through the season and at the end.

In April sports scientists found that at 35C the VO2 Max dropped by four per cent and physical work capacity by eight per cent.

PLAYING IT COOL

Players will regularly clock up 12-14km during 90 minutes in the Premier League but it will be very difficult to cover this ground in extreme conditions and be ready to play again four days later.

In the north of Brazil, especially in the seven games kicking off at 1pm, the pace of the game is expected to be slow and cautious. Coaches will preach about patience, possession and conserving energy.

England’s passers, like captain Steven Gerrard, will be vital in Manaus, dictating tempo and  protecting the ball. They will be up against Andrea Pirlo, Italy’s  master of the art. Even with a kick-off at 6pm local time, it is expected to be hot and sticky.

DEHYDRATION

It does not take much to push the body over the line in extreme heat and humidity. It is like a car when it overheats. In the worst cases, it can affect the central nervous  system and that in turn affects your decision-making.

You only need to be half-a-second out with your timing and you’re making tackles which will expose yourself and others to a greater likelihood of injuries.

On a Liverpool pre-season tour, in Thailand, one of the players came in at half-time in a real mess. The water was draining from him. We laid him out on a towel and he left a soaking wet perfect imprint of his body.

He had taken on the correct amount of fluids but he was  suffering from heatstroke and dehydration and it had started to affect his central nervous system.

We were close to putting him on a drip but managed to cool his core temperature with cold towels in key areas of his body.

SIPPING FLUIDS

In extreme heat dehydration can strike fast.

They have to keep sipping fluids all the time before the problems start. If you drink only water it will dilute everything in your system and wash out minerals and vitamins you want to keep in. You have to keep putting the right  carbohydrates and electrolytes in.

Sometimes you see players sucking gel sachets beside the pitch. They offer a short burst of carbs with a little bit of sodium. Ideally you’d take them with water.

WRAPPING UP

Roy Hodgson ordered his players to wrap up warm for training in Portugal, and England’s trip to Miami was based around gradually becoming accustomed to increased heat and humidity.

The idea of training in woolly hats, gloves and thermals might seem simplistic and old-fashioned, but it makes sense and it does work.

I know elite athletes who  compete in these hot places  without trying to acclimatise. They stay away and go in, race and get out as quickly as possible, so the body doesn’t even begin to adjust, but England are at the World Cup over four weeks.

SHADING IT

Managing time off becomes important in the heat because recovery is as important as training. Years ago we’d have to stop players from sunbathing. Not only were they dehydrating but they were burning the skin as well. That’s not good preparation.

England players will be in Rio but Roy won’t want them heading for the beach. You want them to keep out of the sun.
