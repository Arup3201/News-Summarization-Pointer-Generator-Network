More than 250 fascinating drawings depicting a year in the life of the Queen have emerged and highlight the demanding and exhaustive role she performs.

Artist Michael Noakes was given unprecedented access to the monarch to draw her in private and public on her daily routine and duties, having previously been commissioned to do portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother.

Mr Noakes, of Malvern, Worcestershire, stood in the background and sketched ‘on the hoof’ to capture some of the Queen’s more informal and intimate moments.

The finished album of 260 pictures shows Her Majesty tirelessly performing a whole range of domestic roles across the UK, from the opening of a hospital to attending Royal Ascot.

She is captured meeting and greeting the public in cities such as Edinburgh, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester and Swansea as well as at the formal opening of Parliament and the Scottish Parliament.

The pictures also depict her on numerous overseas visits including trips to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, Ghana, Mozambique and South Korea.

There are works of art showing her 
at formal occasions at Buckingham Palace, such as welcoming dignitaries 
and hosting state dinners and watching over pomp and ceremony events 
like trooping the colour.

Mr Noakes also sketched the Queen, Prince Phillip and the late Queen Mother at Royal households such as Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral.

He was given the access all areas status in 1999, culminating in the book ‘The Daily Life of the Queen, an Artist’s Diary’.

His late wife, the respected author 
Dr Vivien Noakes, accompanied him throughout the unique project and 
wrote the text for the book.

Mr Noakes, 78, is now selling the 260 works of art in one lot at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £25,000.

Auctioneers described the art work as a truly unique sale, given that no other artist has enjoyed as much access to the Queen as Mr Noakes.

Mr Noakes said his ‘gruelling’ year following the Queen around the world ‘nearly killed him’.

He
said: 'It was a very interesting and fascinating year but it was also 
very gruelling and exhausting and all the travelling nearly killed me.

'I
had with me a pad and pencils and ink and sometimes I would be two or 
three feet from her while other times I was stood well back with the 
crowds.

'My wife would take photographs which also helped with my pictures.

'I
added the colour in afterwards and quite often I would be working on 
them until 4am and then have to catch a plane the next morning.

'I
had very few days off because of her extremely busy itinerary and on 
average I produced more than one drawing a day. There were lots of 
pictures that didn’t make it into the book.'

He recalled the moment he nearly 
ruined the Queen’s outfit by staining it with a marker pen as he 
measured her at the start of the project to get his proportions right.

He also praised Prince Phillip for often stepping in when he noticed the Queen flagging slightly.

He
said: 'Prince Phillip would latch on to this and take over and he would
say that he would have people laughing in 15 seconds.'Mr Noakes said he was beginning to downsize his huge collection of art work which was the reason for the sale.

He
said: 'The time is going to come when my children are going to have to 
sort all my art work out, it will be overwhelming for them and they 
might just dump items like these in the bin.'

Mr Noakes, who has previously painted the Queen, Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton, used various mediums for his work including pencil, pen and ink, watercolour and oil.

Mourning: The Queen Mother lying in state at Westminster Hall in 2002. This painting will be auctioned alongside those from 1999

Robert Hall, a picture specialist at London-based Bloomsbury auctioneers, said: 'Michael Noakes is at the top of the tree as far as establishment artists are concerned.

'No other artist has been given that sort of access to the Queen before and so works of art like these very rarely come on to the market.

'From looking at the pictures you do get the sense that the Queen leads an incredibly full life. It does give you an impression of what she gives and does for the country.'The auction takes place at Bloomsbury on September 20.
