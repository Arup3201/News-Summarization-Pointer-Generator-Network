California Chrome arrived in New York on Tuesday to begin preparations for his bid to become horse racing's first Triple Crown winner in 36 years.

The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner arrived at Belmont Park, where co-owner Steve Coburn says his 3-year-old underdog colt will have a guardian angel looking after him June 7.

'I honestly believe this horse is America's horse,' said the 61-year-old factory worker, who owns the year's breakout racing star along with a friend and their wives.

Humble horse: Triple Crown hopeful California Chrome pictured after he arrived at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y. The colt is the offspring of an $8,000 mare and a $2,500 stallion as bred by Coburn and his equally blue collar partner Perry Martin

Coburn told ABC that it may be his sister, who died from cancer at just 36, who's looking after the team of unlikely award-winning horse racers who've dubbed themselves the Dumb Ass Partners and adopted a donkey as a mascot.

'He was born on my sister Brenda’s birthday, Feb. 18,' Coburn said. 'I do believe this colt’s got a guardian angel with him all the time. I say a prayer before every race, and between her and him, everything’s coming true.'

But with or without divine intervention, Coburn says his everyman horse will win thanks to his old fashioned American work ethic.

'He loves people, he loves what he does and that's why he's America's horse,' he told USA Today. 'What he's doing for two guys that work their butts off every day just to put beans and bacon on the table, this horse has given everybody else out there the incentive to say, "You know what? We can do it, too."'

California Chrome was backed off the van - he doesn't like walking straight off like most horses - and then led into the Belmont's barn by assistant trainer Alan Sherman.

'We just hope this horse is letting America know that the little guy can win,' Coburn said. 'I honestly believe this horse is America's horse.'

California Chrome walked several laps around the barn before being taken outside to pose on the grass for a media horde. He later settled into his stall.

'He likes to stand out here and pose,' Sherman said. 'He loves to get his picture taken. He's a very inquisitive horse. He's always checking out what's going on around him. He's actually been so straightforward to train; he's made our jobs easy.'

California Chrome will start training on the track daily beginning Wednesday.

The 3-year-old colt is set to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 7. He owns a six-race winning streak, including the Derby by 1 3/4 lengths and the Preakness by 1 1/2 lengths. No horse has swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont since Affirmed in 1978.

'I think the industry could really use a Triple Crown winner right now, especially with a story like this,' Sherman said. 'This horse didn't cost a ton of money to buy him or breed him. This goes to show you never know what can happen in this game.'

Unlikely: California Chrome, ridden by jockey Victor Espinoza, wins the 139th Preakness Stakes horse race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. If he wins at Belmont, he'll become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 after already staking claim to one of the sport's greatest rags-to-riches stories

Sherman assists his 77-year-old father, Art, who returned to Southern California after the Preakness. The elder Sherman plans to reunite with his horse and son the week before the Belmont.

'I'm so proud of my dad for him to be able to do this towards the end of his career,' Alan Sherman said. 'He's very deserving.'

Preakness runner-up Ride On Curlin accompanied California Chrome on the trip from Baltimore.

Another Preakness starter under consideration for the Belmont is third-place finisher Social Inclusion, who is scheduled to arrive in New York on Friday. General A Rod (fourth), Ring Weekend (fifth) and Kid Cruz (eighth) are questionable to run in the 1 1/2-mile race.

Other probables are Commanding Curve, Danza, Wicked Strong, and Samraat, the second, third, fourth and fifth-place finishers from the Derby; along with Tonalist and Commissioner, who were first and second in the Peter Pan at Belmont; and Intense Holiday, 12th in the Derby.

'It looks like it could be a tough one,' said Todd Pletcher, who trains Danza, Commissioner and Intense Holiday.
