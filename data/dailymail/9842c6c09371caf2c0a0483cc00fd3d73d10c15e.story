Nigeria aims to secure the release by Tuesday of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamist Boko Haram militants, two senior government sources said today, although they declined to say where this handover would take place.

Yesterday, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria’s armed forces, announced that a ceasefire had been agreed with Boko Haram that would allow the girls to be freed.

The girls were taken during exams from the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April causing worldwide shock and revulsion and leading to the twitter #bringbackourgirls campaign.

However, Boko Haram has not yet commented on the reported truce and last night and early this morning launched attacks on the villages of Abadam and Dzur killing at least one person at the former and eight at the latter.

There have been a number of times since April when the Nigerian government has announced a ceasefire or even that it had rescued some of the girls, all reports subsequently proved false so the latest claim has been met with some scepticism in the country.

The ceasefire announcement comes just before a rally in Abuja where President Goodluck Jonathan, or his vice president Namadi Sambo, is expected to announce his candidacy for the February 2015 elections.

One source told Reuters, the news agency, ‘I can confirm that [the federal government] is working hard to meet its own part of the agreement so that the release of the abductees can be effected either on Monday or latest Tuesday next week.’

However, a second source was more cautious, stressing that there might have to be more discussions in Nigeria and the Chadian capital N'djamena – the nearest non-Nigerian major city to the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency – before all the details are ironed out.

"We have confidence in those we are negotiating with but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could come up disowning the deal," he said.

"[But] we believe we are talking to the right people."

The reason for his confusion is twofold. Firstly, the group's sole means of conveying messages are videotaped speeches by a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau, its leader whom the military last year said it had killed.

Secondly, the terrorists are split into several factions that loosely cooperate with each other, and it is unclear with which faction the government has been negotiating. It says the talks were held with a formerly unknown militant called Danladi Admadu, who alleges he is the group's "secretary general".

Boko Haram, whose name translates roughly as "Western education is sinful", has massacred thousands in a struggle to carve an Islamic state out of religiously mixed Nigeria, whose southern half is mainly Christian or animist in faith.

Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and its oil-rich economy is the continent's largest.

At today's rally in Abuja, many of President Jonathan's supporters wrapped themselves in the white and green of Nigeria's flag and sang and danced under a banner reading "We Love You Goodluck Jonathan. Our support is 100 percent."

Two candidates for the main opposition coalition, former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari and ex-vice president Atiku Abubakar, have declared their candidacy against Jonathan.
