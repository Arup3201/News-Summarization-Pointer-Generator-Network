Arsenal welcomed some celebrity fans to the Emirates Stadium on Boxing Day as Arsene Wenger's men recorded a vital win over struggling QPR.

Olympic gold medallist Linford Christie was joined by members of Drum and Bass band Rudimetal as the Gunners held on with 10-men last Friday.

Rudimental pair DJ Locksmith and Kesi Dryden were at the game to celebrate Locksmith's birthday - the singer is a huge Arsenal fan.

The band, who played at the club's charity ball last summer, revealed that they were less than impressed with the players' dancing, although they admitted that meeting Arsene Wenger was 'like a dream come true'.

Christie, who won world, European, Commonwealth and Olympic titles throughout his career, has been involved with the club for several years.

His godchildren, Justin and Gavin Hoyte, both came through the club's academy, each eventually playing for the first team before moving on.

Olympic sprinter Linford Christie was also at the Emirates to see Arsenal beat QPR 2-1 on Boxing Day

Christie admitted that he'd 'put his foot in it' when he leaked the new Arsenal kit earlier this year
