Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc has identified Oscar and David Luiz as his top transfer targets this summer.

Chelsea's Brazilian duo have impressed in the Premier League, but have been in and out of the team in recent weeks under Jose Mourinho.

And Blanc has admitted that the pair are of interest to the Ligue 1 champions, despite the Financial Fair Play restrictions.

Interest: Laurent Blanc has admitted he would like to bring Oscar and David Luiz to PSG this summer

Targets: The French manager was speaking to Telefoot about Financial Fair Play restrictions

'[despite FFP] we have the opportunity to prepare a good team,' Blanc told Telefoot.

'You have to target 
the needs and the positions. Oscar and David Luiz are very good players.
 They will interest PSG.'

Luiz has said in the past that a move to PSG suits him, admitting he loves the city. He also has admitted that Brazilian team-mates Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura have urged him to make the switch.

'I like Paris. It's a superb city,' Luiz also told Telefoot. 'Whenever I have a little time, I take a train and go there. I go there often. To play there? You never know. We'll see.

'It would be cool to play with Thiago Silva in Paris, or even in the street like when we were kids.'

Reports from Brazil suggested that a deal has been agreed for Luiz to join Barcelona from Chelsea this summer, but Sportsmail understands that nothing has been finalised.

The two clubs have been in contact, while Bayern Munich are also interested in the defender.

Mourinho, whose side knocked PSG out of 
the Champions League this year, insists it would take a 'crazy' bid of 
around Â£300m to persuade him to sell Oscar, along with another target 
Eden Hazard.

Hazard's former Lille team-mate Yohan Cabaye has also expressed how his side could do with the winger.

He added: 'We all know that I like Hazard. For me, he is one of the best. So it's logical that Paris is interested by his profile.'

Hazard has been criticised in recent weeks by Mourinho for not helping out the team defensively.
