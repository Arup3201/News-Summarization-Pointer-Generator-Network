Steve Hooker has quit his duties as a commentator for host Commonwealth Games broadcaster Network Ten, after his athlete wife was banned for drug use.

Middle-distance runner Katya Kostetskaya has been banned for two years by the World Anti-Doping Agency, with the news coming as a shock to the Australian pole vault champion who has since left Glasgow.

Ten presenter Matt White announced on air on Thursday morning that Hooker wasn't aware of the information prior to it being logged on the agency's website and that he would return to Melbourne to be with his Russian-born wife.

Despite losing their highly regarded athletics commentator, Ten were supportive of Hooker's decision to leave the Games early.

Australian pole vaulter Steve Hooker's wife Ekaterina Kostetskaya has been found guilty of using drugs and banned from athletics for two years

Ten announced former Canadian world record holder and Olympic gold medal winner Donovan Bailey would join their commentary team for the remainder of the Games.

"Steve's priority is his family and he has left Glasgow to be with his wife, Ekaterina, and son Maxim. He has delivered brilliant commentary for the Games, and Network Ten fully supports his decision," said the statement from Ten.

Ekaterina Kostetskaya, who gave birth to the couples' first child last year, received the doping ban after a world championship race on August 30, 2011.

When Hooker retired from pole vaulting in April he said: 'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career.'

The runner's offence was listed as on August 30, 2011 - coinciding with her fifth placing in the 800m final at the world championships in Daegu

Kostetskaya has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015

Records from the 28-year-old's athlete biological passport, which is an electronic record for professional athletes, show she has been found guilty of 'use/attempted use of a prohibited substance/method'

The biological passport allows for doping violations to be detected by noting variances from an athleteâ€™s established levels outside the allowed limits, rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances.

Kostetskaya came fifth in the 800m race in Daegu, South Korea, in 2011, where she is alleged to have used drugs.

She has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015.

Kostetskaya and the now-retired Hooker, an Olympic and world pole vault champion, met at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and married in 2012.

The 32-year-old is the third highest pole vaulter in history, behind Sergey Bubka and Renaud Lavillenie.

He became the first Australian male track and field gold medallist in 40 years when he won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with a vault of 5.96 metres.

He retired from athletics in April 2014, choosing to focus on his family. Kostetskaya gave birth to their first son, Maxim, in 2013.

'After some serious thought I've decided to move onto the next phase of my life and focus on new things that bring me as much joy as athletics has for the past 15 or so years,' reflected Hooker in an interview with the IAAF.

'Family is my biggest priority now. Being a husband and a father is amazing, and I love the change from being an individual athlete with just me to worry about,' he added.

'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career. She has done so much already but she has results that suggest she is more than capable of doing more and I want to be able to assist as much as I can in making that happen.'
