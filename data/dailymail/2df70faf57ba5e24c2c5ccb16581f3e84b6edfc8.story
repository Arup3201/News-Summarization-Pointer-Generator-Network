Boston Marathon champ Meb Keflezighi of the United States was fourth.

Two-time defending champion Geoffrey Mutai was sixth.

Mary Keitany of Kenya won the women's title, overtaking countrywoman Jemima Sumgong with about a half-mile to go. It was her first marathon since 2012 after the birth of her second child.

Keitany won in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 25 minutes, 7 seconds - 3 seconds ahead of Sumgong, which would match the closest finish in the history of the women's race.
