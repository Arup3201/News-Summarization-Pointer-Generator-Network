Cricket’s moral code is mazy at the best of times but it has rarely appeared more complex than in the mixed reaction to the controversial and unusual ‘Mankading’ of Jos Buttler by Sri Lanka at Edgbaston.

Opinions among pundits and the public seem evenly divided on whether Sachithra Senanayake was within his rights to run Buttler out backing up and, more pertinently, whether Angelo Mathews should have withdrawn the appeal.

Your gut instinct as a cricket lover to any ‘spirit of the game’ issue is as good a means as any of deciding your viewpoint. My mind was made up as soon as Michael Gough raised his finger in the deciding one-day international. It was just wrong. It felt that way then and it still does now after much contemplation.

'Mankad': Jos Buttler (right) is run out backing up by Sachithra Senanayake, sparking a storm of controversy

This is not a case of simply backing 
England and I am fully aware that Sri Lanka had warned Buttler and broke
 no laws or regulations. But ‘Mankading’ feels different from any issue 
of non-walking or other  run-out controversies.

For
 instance, I strongly criticised England for not calling Grant Elliott 
back when he was run out at The Oval in 2008 after colliding with Ryan 
Sidebottom. There was just no way they could justify that piece of poor 
sportsmanship.

I also felt 
that India had no need to call Ian Bell back at Trent Bridge three years
 ago because he had been dozy in the extreme in wandering off for tea 
when it was unclear that the ball had crossed the boundary and was dead.

Yet
 I had no issue with Stuart Broad’s non-walk in last year’s Ashes and 
feel that selective walking, as we have seen from some big figures in 
the game’s history who have shamefully claimed the moral high ground, is
 a bigger offence.

Leading question: Cook and Mathews had words at the end following the Sri Lankan skipper's decision not to call Buttler back following the controversial 'Mankad'

Confusing?
 Well, yes, but each incident has to be treated on its merits. So why is
 this one so bad? In his  distinctive way, Graeme Swann hit the nail on 
the head when he tweeted: ‘I did a Mankad on Marc Snell against 
Middlesex Under 11s. It was given out but my dad told me he wished I was
 adopted, he was so disgusted.’

The
 reaction of Swann Snr is one that will resonate with  any coach or 
schoolteacher in charge of a youth game.  Parents: what would you say if
 your kid ‘Mankaded’ someone in their next game and then said, ‘It’s OK,
 I saw it on TV in  England’s match?’ I hope you would put them up for 
adoption as Swann almost was, because it is unedifying and shabby.

The
 biggest irony, of course, is that India withdrew a Mankad appeal in a 
one-day international two years ago. Who were the opponents? Sri Lanka. 
Who was at the crease? Angelo Mathews. Yet that did nothing to influence
 the Sri Lankan captain, even though he was surrounded by senior  
players when Gough asked him if he wanted to withdraw the appeal.

What
 is clear is that the incident has added spice to the Test series. 
Alastair Cook said Sri Lanka had crossed a line and that there would be a
 hangover at next week’s first Test at Lord’s, but it was the press  
conference which followed Cook’s on Tuesday night that was most 
illuminating.

The highly 
respected and experienced Mahela Jayawardene bristled on behalf of his 
captain, his team and, significantly, his bowler Senanayake. The key to 
this issue is that Sri Lanka feel wronged over the reporting of 
Senanayake for a suspect bowling action and that, I believe, led them to
 running out Buttler in the way they did.

The
 inference is that they suspect an English conspiracy against  
Senanayake and there was implied criticism of umpire Ian Gould from Sri 
Lanka team manager Michael de Zoysa, who was alongside Jayawardene at 
Edgbaston. Clearly, two simmering teams will head to Lord’s next week.

Against the spirit of the game: Grant Elliott (left) should have been called by by England following his run out after this collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008

England may have lost only 3-2 against the world’s most consistently successful limited-overs team but much of their batting was old-fashioned and formulaic, while a lot of the seam bowling lacked discipline and penetration.

While England laboured at Edgbaston, Alex Hales was smashing 18 fours and six sixes in his 167 for Notts at Hove. He really does need to be included in a one-paced England 50-over top four before another World Cup comes and goes with a minimal English contribution.
