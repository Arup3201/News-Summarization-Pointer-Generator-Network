Northern Ireland's Milk Cup clash with Mexico was abandoned with 60 seconds remaining after four players were sent off following two mass brawls on Wednesday night.

The hosts had come from behind to lead 2-1 at the Coleraine Showgrounds but the match was overshadowed by the shameful scenes which saw punches and kicks thrown on both sides.

Northern Ireland are expected to be awarded the three points which will see them remain top of the Elite League which also includes Canada and China. 

Fight: Northern Ireland were trailing 1-0 to Mexico when the first brawl broke out 

Early baths: Four players were sent off in total, three after the first incident and one after the second

Robbie McDaid saw red in the melee, while his team-mates Dale Gorman and Josh Doherty found themselves pushed to the floor.

Robbie McDaid The seventeen-year-old from County Tyrone impressed whilst on trial at Leeds United, having previously scored two goals for Northern Irish side Glenavon. The striker, who has been praised for his finishing and positional play, has already been called up to both the Northern Ireland Under-17 and Under-19 sides.  Dale GormanGorman helped his youth club Letterkenny Rovers to league and cup titles before signing a two year scholarship deal with Stevenage. His introduction in an academy fixture against Watford recently was seen as the catalyst for his side overturning a two goal deficit. Josh DohertyA useful player who can play at full-back or in midfield, made his first senior appearance for Watford in their 4-1 defeat to Huddersfield earlier this year. The eighteen-year-old has nine caps and one goal across the Northern Ireland youth setups.

The first fight broke out just before the hour mark as Northern Ireland prepared to take a corner. 

Several players, including Josh Doherty and Dale Gorman, found themselves tossed to the ground.

Both benches joined the melee which only served to heighten tensions as stewards were forced to intervene.

Referee Tim Marshall eventually decided to send off Mexico's Raul Gudino and Carlos Arreola as well as Northern Ireland's Robbie McDaid.

The shocking incidents come almost a year to the day after the same teams clashed in Ballymena. 

On that occasion, Mexico ran out 2-1 winners after Rodrigo Gonzalez was sent off for a push while his team-mate Carlos Arreola lashed out at Cameron McGheehan but avoided a red card.

On Wednesday, Northern Ireland were trailing to Victor Guzman's 30-yard thunderbolt but made full use of their extra man to level through Mikhail Kennedy before Sean Mullan scored what proved to be the winner with three minutes remaining.

But the drama was not over yet as Kevin Gutierrez also saw red for kicking a Northern Ireland player who was lying on the ground.

Stephen Craigan's side beat China on Monday and complete their group stage fixtures against Canada on Friday.

And the manager wants to see Mexico banned from the competition in future. 

Shameful: Punches and kicks were thrown as the brawls marred what was an entertaining game

Shocking: A Northern Irish player was kicked on the ground and the game was abandoned with the score 2-1

'I think some of our players had to protect themselves from kicks, punches and head butts,' he told the BBC.

'It was not nice. There were young kids here from around the world. They were here to watch a football match, they do not expect to see that.

'Mexico did it last year, they had a man sent-off for punching. They have a history of it.

'I have to be careful what I say, but I would like to think Mexico will not be back at the Milk Cup.

'It is not what the Milk Cup is all about. It is about people enjoying football and young kids expressing themselves, not that kind of violence.'
