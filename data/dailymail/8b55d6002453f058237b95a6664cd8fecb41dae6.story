Originally devised as a law enforcement tool, the mugshot quickly deviated from its intended purpose to help with the identification of criminals because the images captured the imagination of people fascinated with crime and the lives of criminals.

For some, celebrity mugshots hold the most interest, while others prefer those of deteriorating junkies but for New York-based collector and curator Mark Michaelson it is mugshots from yesteryear that capture his imagination.

Over the past 20 years, Michaelson has assembled an amazing archive of more than 10,000 vintage mugshots of everyday people from all over the country.

For some, celebrity mugshots hold the most interest, while others prefer those of deteriorating junkies but for New York-based collector and curator Mark Michaelson it is older mugshots that capture his imagination

Over the past 20 years, Michaelson has assembled an amazing archive of more than 10,000 vintage mugshots of everyday people from all over the country

Each closeup has a detail that in some way caught his eye, from scars and bandages to crooked teeth and bizarre haircuts.

‘I’m looking for the photos that move me for whatever reason’ he told the New York Daily News in 2012. ‘From things that are terribly funny to things that are terribly tragic.’

Last month the Swann Galleries in New York auctioned a massive collection of nearly 1500 mugshots belonging to Michaelson from over 100 years ago.

The various vintage photographs showed American men and women whose crimes include larceny to homicide to ‘incendiary’ labor organizers.

They also include 'running numbers', an illegal practice of the 1920s and 1930s in which a 'number runner' would ferry cash for organised gangs controlling a lottery-type betting game.

They collected the bets from the gamblers and delivered the payoff when the gamblers won. Winning numbers were often determined by the last digits of the payoff results of horse races. 

Producer Dennis Mohr first got the idea for a film about mugshots when he saw a copy of The Slammer, a weekly Southern tabloid that publishes pages upon pages of mugshots, in a supermarket

Sold for $10,000, the images are an eclectic selection of crimes and criminals spanning the United Sates and Canada.

The portraits depict a range of socioeconomic types spanning the 1900s-1920s, from the bruised and handsome con man to the dapper, but scary hardened criminal.

Interestingly, women figured prominently, as did a host of different ethnic groups. While some criminals face the camera with aplomb and guile, the posture of those arrested for petty crimes conveys more shame and fear.

Michaelson is also the subject of a forthcoming documentary film, ‘American Mugshot,’ which is due to be released in May.

'I think it’s just human nature to be attracted to faces,' he told The Daily News.

'People have always been fascinated with crime. They want to be involved in something that they cannot touch or do not want to be responsible for.'

Mohr believes that people enjoy the voyeuristic feeling of looking at something both dangerous and close to home.

'At the end of the day, this could happen to any of us,' he said. 'It’s kind of like, "There but for the grace of God, go I."'
