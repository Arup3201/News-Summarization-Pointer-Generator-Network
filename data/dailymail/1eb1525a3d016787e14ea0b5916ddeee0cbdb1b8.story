We are a step closer to DIY phones that could spell the end of expensive upgrades after Google released the first glimpse at how the devices will work.

The Project Ara Module Developers Kit is now available for free for developers, and the tech giant said it is 'a very early version.'

But, following testing, the final version of modular phones is expected to be on sale as soon as the end of this year.

The Project Ara Module Developers Kit is now available. Google said the files give developers a first glimpse at its plans for a DIY phone. Each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton that individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized endos - mini, medium and large, pictured

According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module.

Each phone 
will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - 
made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to.

There will be three different sized 
endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of 
phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. 

Larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will.

Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more.

In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. 

By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them.

Lower-resolution cameras can be swapped with higher-res versions, and users will be also be able to 3D print replacement parts.

Larger Ara phones will be able to accomodate more modules than the mini will, for example.

The project was initially assigned to Motorola, and the handsets had been planned to add to the firm's existing range, but Google sold Motorola in January this year to Lenovo. As part of the sale, Google kept hold of Project Ara, pictured

Google said: 'The Module Developers Kit 
(MDK) defines the Ara platform for module developers and provides 
reference implementations for various design features.

Google's Project Ara is based on the Phonebloks designs by Dutch inventor Dave Hakkens. His components were called bloks, and they each attached to a universal base that contained all the relevant electric connections. They were fixed onto this board using pins, with two screws holding everything in place

'The Ara platform consists of an on-device packet-switched data network based on the MIPI UniPro protocol stack, a flexible power bus, and an elegant industrial design that mechanically unites the modules with an endoskeleton.'

It continued that there will be more releases in the coming months before it reaches a final version towards the end of the year.

Price information has not been revealed. 

Google will host its first Project Ara Developers Conference in California next week.
