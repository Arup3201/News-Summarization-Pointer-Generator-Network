Like most newborns, this rare white tiger club is only just discovering her voice.

But in this clip, when the cute four-week-old cub attempts her first roar, she instead lets out a high-pitched screech.

This doesn't put her off and the tiny cub continues to try, but only repeats the screeches as she roams around in Dade City's Wild Things Park in Florida. 

Adorable: The four-week-old cub was named Maylea by staff at Dade City's Wild Things Park in Florida

Conservation: Her birth is important for the white tiger species as there are only 200 left in the world

Staff at Wild Things, which is famous for Randy the Tiger Man, have named the tiny cub Maylea.  

Visitors to the park can book group 'encounters' with the cub or enjoy one-on-one time.

And from December, visitors to the park will be able to swim with the baby tiger. 

But it doesn't come cheap at $200 per person for half an hour. 

Her birth is important for the conservation of the white tiger species as there are only 200 left in the world.

Rare: White tigers, found across the Indian subcontinent, have a pigmentation mutation from Bengal tigers

The park is active in conserving many endangered species, which visitors can book 'encounters' with 

A spokesperson for Wild Things said: 'Maylea is such a sweet, lovable tiger cub.

'She likes nothing better than to crawl up on the trainer's lap or to lay her head on their feet as they are working.

'With only 1000 breeding females let in the entire world of all species of tiger, their future is critical.

'The goal for us is to enhance wild species populations through support of wildlife conservation projects including native educational programs.'

White tiger cubs have a pigmentation mutation from Bengal tigers and are found across the Indian subcontinent.

The team at Wild Things are actively involved in the conservation of many endangered species including Bengal tigers.

Friendly: Visitors will soon be able to swim with the young cub, pictured with visitors
