'It frightens me': Baroness Campbell, who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy, made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday

Baroness Campbell, who has battled a degenerative disease for half a century, made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday, saying: 'This offers no comfort to me - it frightens me.'

The Baroness of Surbiton was addressing a marathon 10-hour debate in 
the House of Lords on whether terminally ill patients should be helped 
to die if they wish.

Breathing through a ventilator, she said Lord Falconer's Bill was aimed at her whether she wanted it or not, saying: 'I did not ask it and I do not want it, but it is about me nevertheless.'

Baroness Campbell, who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy, said that in moments of despair, she might be tempted to ask for assisted dying - and if the law changed, doctors would not stop her. 

She told peers: 'It frightens me because 
in periods of greatest difficulty I know I might be tempted to use it. 
It only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me.'

Lord Falconer of Thoroton, a long-term 
campaigner for the right to die, has proposed that people with less than
 six months to live be allowed to kill themselves with a lethal dose of 
drugs prepared – but not administered – by a doctor.

He said his proposed law 
contained enough safeguards to prevent abuses and would be used in 
‘limited’ circumstances to alleviate terrible suffering.

It is completely different from the euthanasia laws in Holland and Belgium which he rejects, he said.

A
 patient would only be allowed to take their own life if they are judged
 to have the mental capacity to make the choice – and after an 
examination by two doctors.

The law excludes those, like Baroness Campbell, who are not deemed terminally ill, according to the Daily Telegraph.

But
 the peer told her fellows that the Bill would also affect people like 
her, saying: 'Before anyone disputes this, imagine that it is already 
law and that I ask for assistance to die.

'Do your Lordships think that I would be refused? You can be sure that there would be doctors and lawyers willing to support my right to die.'

A record 130 peers put their names down to speak at the Bill’s second reading. On both sides of the debate, peers told of the appalling suffering of loved ones.

Lord
 Tebbit, whose wife was left paralysed by an IRA bomb, made a an 
impassioned warning against assisted dying, saying ‘the road to hell is 
paved with good intentions’.

‘Many people, caring so much for those they leave behind, are dying earlier and alone because they fear implicating their loved ones in a criminal enterprise. They hoard pills or put a plastic bag over their head when they are alone. It is time for a change in the law.’ Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who proposed the Bill ‘When suffering is so great, when patients know they are at the end of life, make repeated pleas to die, it seems a denial of loving compassion which is the hallmark of Christianity to refuse to fulfil their own clearly stated request.’ Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury ‘I get very angry when those who oppose the Bill misrepresent what it is actually proposing and fail to mention how limited its aims intentionally are. It applies only to those who are already terminally ill yet still in sound mind who want, as we all surely do, some control or say in the manner of their own death. It has nothing to do with coercing vulnerable old people into killing themselves.’ Labour peer Lord Howarth

‘The Bill would provide a route to great savings in public and private expenditure, and to a great pressure on the elderly, the sick and the disabled to do the decent thing and cease to be a burden on others. Those who care for such people are all too familiar with the moments of black despair that prompt those words, “I would be better dead, so that you could get on with your life”.’Lord Tebbit, former cabinet minister whose wife was left paralysed by the Brighton bomb ‘This Bill has broad categories into which anyone can be shoe-horned and it comes within a whisker of full-blown euthanasia. Are there safeguards? No, there are only broad categories into which you will find some doctor who would state that almost anyone fits.’ Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, former president of the Royal College of Medicine

‘It frightens me because 
in periods of greatest difficulty I know I might be tempted to use it. 
It only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me.’ Baroness Campbell of Surbiton

Since his wife Margaret was seriously injured by the Brighton bomb in 1984,
 the Tory former cabinet minister said he had come to know the ‘moments 
of black despair which prompt those words: “I would be better dead so 
that you could get on with your life”.’

But he implored fellow peers not to 
change the law, as he feared it would be a ‘breeding ground for 
vultures’ seeking to profit from the deaths of frail elderly relatives.

He
 described the case of an elderly lady he spoke to who said she wished 
to leave her assets to charity, as she had no children, but feared her 
family would find a way to claim them.

Plea: Lord Tebbit and his wife Margaret who was left paralysed by the Brighton bombing in 1984

‘“You
 see”, she said, “I have no children but I have several vultures 
awaiting my death”. This Bill will be a breeding ground for vultures, 
individual and corporate. It creates too much financial incentive for 
the taking of life.’

The
 model Lord Falconer has followed is that introduced in the US state of 
Oregon, which he said was only used 80 times last year.

But
 opponent Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the Paralympic gold-medallist, 
said that as Oregon has only 3million people, if the same trend was 
replicated in the UK some 1,600 people a year could take their own lives
 in doctors’ surgeries or Dignitas-style clinics.

Many raised concerns about whether the agreement of two doctors would really be sought.

Lord Tebbit highlighted the disclosure
 last year that doctors were secretly authorising abortions on grounds 
of sex selection, by pre-signing forms for women they had never met.

Baroness
 Finlay of Llandaff, former president of the Royal Society of Medicine, 
warned that fellow GPs had counter-signed the 176 cremation forms for 
patients murdered by Harold Shipman.

Lord
 Falconer’s Bill will be scrutinised by a committee later in the year. 
Although it puts the highly-charged issue back on the political agenda, 
it is unlikely to proceed further.

The Mail reported last week how a Dutch academic who used to support euthanasia warned the UK not to adopt assisted dying.

Theo Boer said: ‘Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely ever to go back in again.’
