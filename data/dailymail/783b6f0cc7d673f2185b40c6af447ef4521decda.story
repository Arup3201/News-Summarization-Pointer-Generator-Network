A young boy bled to death in hospital over a weekend due to a severe lack of communication between doctors, a coroner has ruled.

Two-year-old Tharun Umashankar died from bleeding of the stomach lining which was probably caused by his intolerance to milk.

He was rushed into Sheffield Children's Hospital and despite suffering a previous large internal bleed, was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day.

Independent expert Dr David Crabbe, a paediatric surgeon, said the procedure would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach - a procedure which would have saved him.

Tragic: Two-year-old Tharun Umashankar bled to death in hospital due to a lack of communication between doctors, a coroner has ruled

He told the Sheffield inquest: 'What was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastroenterologists. Closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome.'

Tharun's distraught mother Sentamil, 38, broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing: 'I believed they would cure him and make him well.'

Recording a narrative verdict, Sheffield Cornoner Chris Dories said: 'On the basis of expert opinion, there was a a failure to plan and/or a failure to communicate about a child who was known to be at serious risk.

'While it remains unclear whether requested communication to the gastroenterologist at the first sign of deterioration would have saved Tharun's life, it is very clear that it may have done so.

'However, endoscopy and surgery on the previous day would likely have saved Tharun's life, but such was a matter of judgment rather than specific failure.'

Tharun had endured three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain, but was thought well enough to be discharged on Friday, July 9, 2010.

Delay: Tharun was rushed into Sheffield Children's Hospital and, despite suffering a previous large internal bleed, was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day

Consultant paediatric 
gastroenterologist Dr David Campbell, who was in overall charge of 
Tharun although off-duty that weekend, said he left instructions to be 
called if the boy had a serious bleed again.

Mrs
Umashankar, who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven, 
left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again. 'He cried
and I felt he was in pain,' she said. 'His body was cool and 
exhausted.'

Tharun was rushed by ambulance to Barnsley District Hospital and several hours later was transferred to the Children's Hospital unit on the afternoon of Saturday, July 10.

The mother said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was 'full of blood' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses.

'A nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth,' she said.

Mrs Umashankar was then told by staff that Dr Campbell would perform another endoscopy on Tharun at 8am on the Sunday morning.

An independent expert said an endoscopy would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach, saving his life

But in the middle of the night she 
noticed his stomach was distended and 'swollen like a bubble'. A doctor 
thought it might simply be a build-up of gas, but at 4am Tharun vomited 
blood again.

By 6.30am 
'all the doctors were in panic and confused'. She said that when Dr 
Campbell arrived she was pleased, as 'I believed he was going to save my
so'.

But despite a blood transfusion, Tharun failed to respond and he died at 9am on the Sunday.

Paediatric registrar Dr Tafadzwa Makaya, whose job was to stabilise the boy, told the Sheffield inquest she had not been informed of any 'red button plan' to alert Dr Campbell and a surgical team if there was a further bleed.

When she first saw Tharun he was sat up in bed watching CBeebies on a monitor with his mother and appeared stable. She was only called by a nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again.

She instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a raised pulse, called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of blood which should have been ready.

Dr Makaya said she alerted both the surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told Dr Campbell would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am.

Tharun had already had three endoscopies at Sheffield Children's Hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain

When coroner Chris Dorries pointed out that Dr Campbell had asked to be made aware if there was any further bleeding she replied: 'There was no red button plan delivered to me.'

Dr Michael Powers QC, for the family, put it to Dr Makaya: 'Knowing that this is a significant bleed, you didn't make any contact with anyone anywhere until 6.15am.'

She replied: 'I assessed and I managed and then I contacted my superiors.'

Tharun's family are now taking civil action for damages against the hospital

Specialist paediatric registrar Dr James Pauling said he arranged for Dr Campbell to do the endoscopy on Sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place. He said: 'I don't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding.'

He himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a 'serious finding'.

Mrs Umashankar and her petrol station cashier husband Sivananthan, 42, ran a grocery store in Barnsley at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in Tooting, London. They came to the UK 12 years ago and are British nationals.

Dr Crabbe, who reviewed the case, said Tharun had a 'mighty strange illness' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a child before.

He said the Children's Hospital was unique in that Tharun was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons.

The boy should have had an endoscopy on the Saturday afternoon which was an 'error of judgment' by the doctors caring for him.

After the hearing, Tharun's uncle Murali Gunarajah, speaking for the family said: 'They are very, very sad that this has happened to their baby.

'They are also upset that the hospital has not apologised or said sorry so far. They think no mother should have to go through what she has again.'

The family are taking civil action for damages against the hospital.Â
