Warrant Officer Will Casson-Smith (pictured) denies an accusation of sexual assault. The bandmaster is currently facing a court martial

A drunk Army bandmaster lured a teenage trainee musician to his room and attacked her, a court martial heard.

Warrant Officer Will Casson-Smith, 35, a leading figure in one of Britain’s most prestigious military bands, stripped to his underpants and admired himself in the mirror before sexually assaulting the girl, it was claimed.

She was then 19 and believed they were going to his room to talk about her Army career.

Lieutenant Colonel Graham Coombes, prosecuting, told a panel of five officers: ‘Fortified by alcohol, he lured her to his room to try his luck with her in a sexual manner.

‘The defendant took advantage of his rank to take advantage of his victim.

‘She was a trainee 15 years his junior. He lured her back to his accommodation in the Warrant Officers’ and Sergeants’ Mess where he sexually assaulted her.’

The court heard Casson-Smith, of the Royal Artillery Band, undressed himself and kissed her on the lips and neck, before putting his hand under her sweater and feeling her breasts.

Colonel Coombes told the court martial in Colchester, Essex, yesterday: ‘He upped the sexual ante.

‘She was trapped by the disparity in rank between them – she a phase two trainee and he a WO1 [Warrant Officer Class 1]. She also knew she was not supposed to be there in the accommodation.’

He added: ‘Casson-Smith says he has no memory of the incident due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed that day.’

The alleged victim visited a pub across the road from Kneller Hall, the Royal Military School of Music, near Twickenham, south-west London, in October last year.

Casson-Smith, who was then master of the band of the Adjutant General’s Corps, was drunk in the pub and was seen wobbling on his feet, singing and rapping.

The woman, who is now 20 and cannot be named for legal reasons, was having doubts about continuing her career as an Army musician.

The pair chatted in the pub’s smoking area and she returned to the base with him. She told the court: ‘I was thinking of transferring because I was not enjoying music as much as I thought I would. I thought we were going to the room to continue the conversation about my career.

‘I was nervous because I should not have been there.

The woman told Royal Military Police in an interview played to the court: ‘He took off his shoes and then his socks. He then took off his shirt and began admiring himself in the mirror … I just wanted to get out. I had a rush-of-blood feeling, fear. I was scared.

‘Then he began kissing me on the lips and the neck. He was trying to get his tongue into my mouth. I was backing off because I did not want him to kiss me. I did not kiss him back.

‘He was pulling my jumper up to get it off and I … kept it down. He put his hand inside my jumper and T-shirt. He was running his fingers across my stomach.

‘I felt I couldn’t say anything to him. He got his hand further up and touched my breasts inside my bra … I pushed his arm out.’

She said she then managed to leave the room.

Casson-Smith told Royal Military Police that he found the allegation ‘extremely upsetting’.

He added: ‘I got very drunk and cannot recall the detail of what occurred. I do not remember when I left the pub or what may or may not have happened after that … I cannot believe I would do anything like this.’ Casson-Smith denies sexual assault.

The court martial continues.
