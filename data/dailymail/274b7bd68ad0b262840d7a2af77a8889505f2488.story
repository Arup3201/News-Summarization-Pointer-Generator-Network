Nearly ten years ago, Prince William, pictured in 2004, spent a fortnight working in Chatsworth House

Prince William spent a fortnight living and working incognito in one of Britain's most splendid stately homes, a new memoir has revealed.

Nearly a decade after his Downton Abbey-style exploits, the Prince's days dressed in overalls and eating fish and chips with fellow housemen and joiners at Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, have been revealed. 

In Chatsworth: The Housekeeper's Tale, Christine Robinson revealed stories from her 40 years working at the country estate.

She describes meetings with everyone from the Queen and top politicians to Sir Anthony Hopkins.

But one of her favourite anecdotes recalls the days when Prince William was living and working at the mansion in October 2005.

'He spent a week working around the estate and made sausage rolls and mince pies,' she told the Sunday Express. 

'The look on visitors' faces was priceless, most obviously thought to themselves, 'that joiner is the double of Prince William.'

'When two old ladies came straight out and asked him, he admitted he really was the heir to the throne.'

Christine, 59, started with a holiday job at Chatsworth alongside the housekeeping team in 1974.

She cleaned, sold ice-cream and worked in the Orangery shop every summer until 1977.

After graduating with a history degree from Newcastle University, she joined the housekeeping team, and went on to become head housekeeper eight years ago.

Chatsworth House's head housekeeper Christine Robinson has written a memoir about her time there

She said: 'Only a handful of staff still working in the House can remember Chatsworth in its heyday at the time of the 11th Duke and Duchess, and I feel fortunate to be amongst their number. 

'I give many talks to outside groups about the House and how we care for it, and one question always asked at the end of the talk is, “Why don’t you write all this down?” With that in mind, I began to gather my thoughts together about ten years ago, and the idea has finally come to fruition. 

'I have met and worked with many Chatsworth characters over the years, and they too are brought to life, I hope, through the anecdotes I relate along the way.' 

In her book, she describes the history of the house from the early 1900s when her grandmother and great-grandmother worked in the kitchens. 

Christine worked closely with the late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, the youngest of the famous Mitford sisters whose aristocratic lives mesmerised the public, until she died in September at 94.

Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, is the seat of the Duke of Devonshire and has been in the Cavendish family since 1549. 

The history of Chatsworth begins with Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, who was better known as Bess of Hardwick. 

Bess married four times, and it was with her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, who bought the estate in 1549 for £600 in 1549.

In 1552, they began to build the first house on the site. The Hunting Tower, built in the 1580s, still stands on the hill above Chatsworth.

By 1694, Chatsworth had fallen into a poor state of repair. The 4th Earl and 1st Duke of Devonshire began some much-needed work on the old house.

The 2nd Duke made no changes to the house and garden, but he was a connoisseur of the arts, and responsible for an outstanding collection, which included paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman gems. 

The 5th Duke of Devonshire's principal residence was in London, but when they did come to Chatsworth, it was filled it with friends and relations. 

The house was open to the public, and on one day a month dinner was provided for whoever came to visit.

The 6th Duke of Devonshire is remembered today as the 'Bachelor' Duke as he never married. He loved entertaining his friends and spent 47 years improving his many houses. 

He asked architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville to build the long North Wing at Chatsworth. The Duke formed a particularly important collection of sculpture which was housed in the purpose-built Sculpture Gallery in the new North Wing.

When Edward Cavendish succeeded his father as 10th Duke of Devonshire in 1938, he and his wife planned many improvements at Chatsworth. 

But then the Second World War broke out and Chatsworth was occupied by Penrhos College, a girls' boarding school in Colwyn Bay. 

In 1949 the house was re-opened to visitors and 105,000 people visited within a year.

In 1981 the running of Chatsworth was taken over by the Chatsworth House Trust, a charitable foundation established by the 11th Duke to help ensure the preservation of the house, its essential contents, the garden and the park for the benefit of the general public. 

The 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke - Peregrine Cavendish.

The 11th Duke's widow, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who was very active in promoting the estate and attracting visitors. She died in September this year. 

She was also responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. 

The house is a popular filming location and was used to film Pride and Prejudice, starring Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, in 2005 and more recently BBC series Peaky Blinders.
