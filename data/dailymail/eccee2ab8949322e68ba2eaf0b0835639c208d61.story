Harry Redknapp believes the prospect of facing Scotland in a friendly will mean more to England than any of their Euro 2016 qualifiers.

The Queens Park Rangers manager feels Roy Hodgson's men are freewheeling in an uninspiring section comprising of Slovenia, Switzerland, Lithuania, Estonia and San Marino.

England racked up their fourth successive win with a 3-1 triumph over Slovenia on Saturday and are expected to coast to top spot without engaging top gear.

Accordingly, Redknapp believes the prospect of a blood and thunder Auld Enemy clash at Celtic Park on Tuesday will quicken the pulse more than any game on the road to France.

'The group we are in is poor,' Redknapp stated. 'There's no competition in it. It's not like the Scotland group. That's a tough group, with good teams in it.

'England's group really is one you can't judge them on. I watched the game last night (against Slovenia) and the other team are just a poor team. I mean what was their standard? What are they? A Championship team at best, middle/bottom half of the Championship probably.

'I think from the punters' point of view, if you are going to Wembley do you want to watch San Marino or someone? Really?

'You would want to watch them play Scotland or the Republic of Ireland. If you ask me if I'd rather watch last night's England game or the game on Tuesday night, I'd rather watch the game on Tuesday. It'll be a full-blooded affair.'

Having finished bottom of their World Cup group with a solitary point, England have much to do on the international stage to convince their fans they are still worthy of still being considered one of the nations.

Tomorrow's game may be a friendly but Redknapp feels the importance of it will not be lost on Hodgson's players.

'I think they will take it seriously,' he added. 'They will know there is a lot of pride at stake. They will come and want to perform well. They are on a good run.

'They can only beat what's in front of them but we're in a poor group. This is a much better test and I think it will be interesting to see how we come through this one.

'The mere fact of England-Scotland and the traditions of the game will come out and it will be a full-blooded affair.

'I remember coming here with Keegan when England won 2-0 but Scotland came to Wembley and battered us when Don Hutchison scored and England hung on for grim life. Those were competitive games.'

England's 100 per cent start continued with a 3-1 win over Slovenia, but it failed to excite Redknapp
