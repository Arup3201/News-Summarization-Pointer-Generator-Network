The heroes who helped save three children after their pregnant mother drove their car into the ocean have spoken out about how she appeared to be in a daze when they tried talking to her during the harrowing rescue.

'When I was speaking to her her eyes were wide,' Good Samaritan Stacy Robinson said.

'By the time I ran over I noticed the son was snatching at the wheel, trying to get her to come back toward the shore and I was asking, I was like, "What is going on, why are you driving on the water?"'

Robinson and others were bystanders on Daytona Beach when they saw Ebony Wilkerson drive her minivan into the water.

'At
 first we didn't know what was going on but when I heard the cries for 
help I knew it was a done deal. I had to do something,' Robinson said.

North
 Carolina native Tim Tesseneer and his wife were driving along the beach
 shooting a video when they saw Wilkerson's son stick his head out the 
window and scream for help.

'I'll
 never get the picture out of my head: the little boy with his 
outstretched arms saying "Help us! Our mom's trying to kill us!"' 
Tesseneer told ABC.

Desperate: Tim Tesseneer, in the bright jacket, was driving along the beach with his wife when they spotted the boy trying to climb out of the car and call for help

Heartbreaking: Tesseneer said that he will never forget the boy's cries, when he said that their mom was trying to kill them

'The

 kids are like, "No there's a baby. There's a baby". She (the mother) wouldn't say a word. She didn't tell us nothing
 about a
 baby,' he said to a different station.

'She had this look on her face, I can't describe it. It was just an awful blank look, like spaced out look.'

At one moment in the video footage, it appears as if the mother is pushing the rescuers away from the car door, as if in an effort to stop them from helping her children.

It 
has also been revealed that police had interviewed Wilkerson just hours 
before the incident, at the urging of her sister who became worried when
 Wilkerson started talking about demons.

Pushing them away: Footage shows Wilkerson (on the far left) appear to push the lifeguard away from her door as she gets out of the car without being helped- but leaves her three children trapped inside

'She's talking about Jesus, that there's demons in the house,' Ebony Wilkerson's sister told
 police in a frantic phone call. Wlikerson, a resident of South 
Carolina, had been staying at her sister's house near Daytona Beach on 
Tuesday before she drove off.

'She's got the kids in the car with her.'

Wilkerson
 told police that she feared her husband would be coming to harm her and
 her children. She said that she had worked with with a domestic 
violence shelter to find a 'safe place' for her to go.

After the call to dispatch Tuesday, Daytona Beach police officers stopped her black Honda Odyssey.

'When we spoke with her she was lucid,' Police Chief Mike Chitwood said.

Dramatic: Lifeguards and passersby try to secure the vehicle as waves crash around it

What remained: Just moments after the children were taken out of the car, it flipped over completely and waves tore through it

Emergency responders: The Good Samaritans led the charge but then beach patrol took over

'The children were in the back seat, 
they were buckled in and were not in distress. Although the sergeant 
said she looked like she had some mental illness, she did not fit the 
criteria for going into custody under the Baker Act.'

'If
 she made any statements that she was suicidal or homicidal officers 
would have taken her into custody,' said Volusia County Sheriff Ben 
Johnson.

The Florida 
Mental Health Act, commonly known as the Baker Act, allows authorities 
to involuntarily take people into custody if they seem to be a threat to
 themselves.

Two
 hours after the police stop, Wilkerson drove into the ocean. Bystanders
 and officers helped pull her and her children — ages 3, 9 and 10 — from
 their minivan as it was almost submerged.

Help: The woman's sister called police and 
warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a 
welfare check but they released her because she was lucid

The
 children were turned over to welfare authorities. The Volusia County 
Sheriff's Office said Wilkerson was undergoing a mental evaluation. 
Sheriff Ben Johnson said it's too early to say whether Wilkerson will 
face criminal charges.

'They have been through a very rough ordeal,' Florida Department of Chidren and Families spokesman John Harrell said.

'We would not want to have the children placed in an environment in which they would not be cared for.'

Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the 31-year-old mother was physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a 
tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards
 try to pull her children from the vehicle.

Witnesses
 described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children 
remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her 
under the van.

'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner.

In the video several men frantically 
try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's 
side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan.

The small child is eventually pulled to safety.

Hearing the call: Stacy Robinson said that he didn't know what was going on and then heard children screaming

Defending their actions: Sheriff Ben Johnson said that his deputies had to let her go because they had no legal justification to hold her

Another tourist described watching with horror.

'My
 friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the 
beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin 
visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6.

'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

'That's
 when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out 
two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and 
brought a little toddler out of the car'.

Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident.

'When she first was drifting into the ocean, we thought maybe an accident,' Donna Pratt told the broadcaster.

'But
 when the bystanders went to help, she clearly went deeper into the 
ocean. She drove right toward it, so it's hard to believe it was an 
accident.'
