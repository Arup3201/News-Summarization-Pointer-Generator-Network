Relatives of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan who were put under observation by CDC after they visited him on the day he was taken to hospital are still waiting for an answer about what they should do 24 hours after they begged them for help.

Aaron Yah, 43, and wife Youngor Jallah, 35, yesterday told of their ordeal in isolation and revealed that they had not received direct orders to stay indoors.

Today MailOnline returned to the family's small apartment to find a family without answers, without power following violent electrical storms that brought down lines and running low on food, water and diapers for their youngest child.

Fears: Youngor and her husband Aaron Yah are trapped in their home and feel as if they've been left adrift by officials. They have no power, cannot go out for food and the waste - including soiled nappies, is piling up

Most troubling of all some family members are beginning to show cold-like symptoms.

Ms Jallah repeatedly wiped her eyes - which appeared sticky - with a paper towel while a child sneezed and coughed in the background. While it is unlikely to be related to the Ebola virus, they did not look as healthy as they did when MailOnline visited on Thursday.

Ms Jallah said: 'We asked the CDC last night if we have to stay indoors and they said they would come back to us overnight and tell us this morning.'

The CDC had been in contact with them over the last few says, checking their temperatures and blood pressures. 

But it was close to midday when Youngor spoke and the family was still waiting for officials to visit and answer their questions from Thursday. 

The couple live in the home with their four children: three boys aged two, four and 11 and a daughter, aged six.

She continued: 'Our phone is not working because of the storm. So we don't know.'

MailOnline contacted CDC officials on behalf of the family after our visit to their home. An official said she would pass on the information. 

The family has also had no instruction about how to dispose of the waste already accumulating in their small second floor apartment. The waste, which may be contaminated, includes soiled diapers.

Ebola is only contagious when the infected person is exhibiting symptoms. But it can then be transmitted by an exchange of body fluids including blood, saliva, semen and feces if contact is at a point of entry like a cut or graze, mouth, nose or eyes.

The entire family had exposure to Mr Duncan during the time when he was exhibiting increasingly violent symptoms and now they feel as if they've been cast adrift.

Ms Jallah, Mr Duncan’s stepdaughter, said that she last spoke with her quarantined mother, Louise Troh, yesterday before the storms cut them off entirely.

She said: 'She was well. She said the CDC had come and taken their temperature and it was all normal.'

Finally: Hazmat teams move into the apartment where Duncan was staying when he fell sick - five days after he was taken to hospital vomiting with the Ebola virus

Horror: Youngor was at the apartment on Sunday when Duncan took a serious turn for the worse. She brought him a cup of tea while he was lying in bed

On Friday afternoon Hazmat teams were moving into the apartment where Duncan had been staying to finally clean it. Troh had complained that his sweat-stained sheets were still on the bed and the towels he used in plastic bags. 

Ms Jallah last saw her mother when she visited the Ivy Apartments, now quarantined under armed guard on Sunday.

She told the Washington Post that she found Duncan in bed, fully dressed and shivering. After going to buy him a blanket, she helped lift him by his back so the man she calls 'Daddy' could drink some hot tea she made him. It was then she noticed redness in his eyes, a well-recognized sign of Ebola.

With his temperature at 102F, Ms Jallah who, like her husband Mr Yah is a nursing assistant, called 911.

When the ambulance arrived Ms Jallah brought the blanket in which she had wrapped her stepfather to the hospital.

Mr Yah yesterday told MailOnline his own brief conversation with his friend that day. He said: 'The last time I saw Thomas was Sunday, the day he went to hospital. I had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine, he had been just fine.

'But that day I passed by on Sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and I asked him how he was. He said, "I'm not okay."

Family: Youngor calls Duncan Daddy. He is married to her mother Louise Troh, who is in quarantine

'He said he had been having diarrhea all night.'

Mr Duncan was diagnosed on Tuesday, and Mr Yah said that he was told the news the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the Meadows Nursing home where he works as a nursing assistant.
