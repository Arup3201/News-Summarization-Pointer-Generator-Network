Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been offered a new one-year deal and is keen to extend his career at the club.

Arteta signed three years ago from Everton for £10million and his contract is due to expire at the end of the season, by which time the Basque midfielder will be 33.

Arsene Wenger’s standard policy for players over 30 is to offer them no more than 12 months at a time but this will suit Arteta, who inherited the captaincy from Thomas Vermaelen in the summer.

Negotiations are open and are unlikely to be affected by another niggling injury which will keep the skipper out of action until after the next international break.

Arteta, ruled out for a month after twisting an ankle in Besiktas in August, hobbled off with a calf problem during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham and faces another three weeks out. 

Aaron Ramsey pulled a hamstring in the same game and faces a month out, but there was a more optimistic medical bulletin for Wenger from Jack Wilshere, who hurt an ankle against Spurs but has been told there is no serious damage. 

The England midfielder has not yet been ruled out of facing Galatasaray in the Champions League tomorrow night.

Meanwhile, Gunners striker Olivier Giroud is said to have agreed a new four-year deal at the Emirates, worth £80,000-week.
