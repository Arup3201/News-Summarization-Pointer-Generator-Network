Thousands of roads are to be reclassified as too dangerous to prevent fresh Satnav chaos in the countryside.

From April, ministers will hand councils the new powers to try and prevent crashes and traffic jams on unsuitable routes.

Since the explosion in Satnav sales, hundreds of villages and country roads have been dogged by lorries and car drivers who follow their in car computer’s guidance to the letter.

Satellite navigation systems will now tell drivers if the road is unsuitable for lorries

This means they often end up stuck in cul-de-sacs or in town or village centres that are unsuitable for large vehicles.

Town halls will no longer have to apply each time to Whitehall for permission to reclassify routes. The new information will be passed on to the Satnav firms to update their software.

To ram home the message, Transport Minister Norman Baker is to host a special Government  ‘sat nav summit’ in early March aimed at ending the misery caused when lorry and car drivers blindly  follow out-of-date directions from their satnavs.

The changes will stop satnav systems sending lorries on shortcuts down unsuitable country lanes

Roads which were considered major routes decades ago may now be in busy built up villages and towns, said a Department of Transport spokesman.

Transport minister Mr Baker said: ‘Out-of-date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities. It is vital highway authorities, mapping companies and satnav manufacturers work more closely together to provide drivers with accurate, up-to-date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges.

This will help prevent huge lorries from being sent down inappropriate roads and ensure motorists are given the best possible directions.’

Officials say the problem is exacerbated by motorists who fail to update their own satnav maps, either because they forget or are unaware they can do so.

But the AA warned that the measures to reclassify roads could lead to a ‘mismatch’ of road types from one county to another which will be  ‘confusing’ for satnav mapping companies and drivers alike.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists said better signs and ‘a good map’ would help more.

IAM director of policy and research Neil Greig said: ‘While we welcome the ‘Satnav Summit’, high quality and consistent signposting will always be the best way to ensure that drivers get the information they require when and where they need it most.’

1. September 2009: A driver whose car was left teetering on the edge of a 100ft cliff after following his satnav was ordered to pay nearly £900 for driving without due care and attention. Robert Jones, 43, nearly plunged down the cliff in his BMW after obeying instructions which sent him along a steep, narrow path, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire in March 2009.2. June 2009: A 79-year old retired banker was taken the wrong way to hospital through country lanes twice by ambulance crews, due to faulty satnav devices. The 'anomaly' in the system led to Leslie Palmer enduring a 45-minute trip to accident & emergency at Royal Hampshire County Hospital both times when it should only have taken 20 minutes. But separate ambulance crews in separate vehicles told his wife of 55 years, Jean, that they had to use satnav as that was the rule.3. September 2008: A crematorium boss saw four funerals disrupted in one afternoon by lorries sent the wrong way due to out-of-date satnav information. Marjorie Joplin said the HGVs caused 'absolute chaos' after being directed down a lane to Llanelli Crematorium, in west Wales.4. April 2008: A minibus owned by a taxi firm called Streamline was left stranded after a satellite navigation system guided it into a river. The driver was on his way to collect a fare in Castle Acre, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he took a wrong turn into the River Nar.5. March 2008: A taxi satnav blunder left the Chelsea-supporting daughter of Earl Spencer disappointed after she was dropped off at the wrong Stamford Bridge. After being picked up from the Earl's Althorp estate near Northampton, the teenager found herself in a remote village near York, more than 200 miles away from the Blues' home.

6. December 2007: Office workers on a Christmas shopping trip to France were taken to the wrong country after a satnav error diverted their coach seven hours off course. Instead of arriving in the French city of Lille, 50 members of Cheltenham and Gloucester sports and social club were diverted 98 miles away to a village, of the same name, in Belgium, leaving them only two hours to shop after the driver corrected his mistake.

7. March 2007: A coachload of schoolchildren due to visit Hampton Court Palace were instead driven around for five hours in traffic after the driver using satnav ended up at Hampton Court, in Islington, north London. The children, aged around eight and from Orchard Lea Junior School in Fareham, Hampshire, never got to visit the attraction that day after a teacher called a halt to the trip.
