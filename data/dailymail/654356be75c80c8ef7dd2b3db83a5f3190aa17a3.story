A family of Jehovah's Witnesses have been found dead in their South Carolina home after what police say was a shocking murder-suicide.

The bodies of a couple - believed to be Sheddrick and Kia Miller - and their two young children were found Wednesday morning scattered throughout the family's two-story home near Irmo.

Police were called to the home around 10:30 a.m. after man's mother discovered the grim scene.

The children were found dead in their respective bedrooms, and the two adults were found together in the master bedroom, Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Curtis Wilson told the Charlotte Observer.

Each of the four was shot in the upper body and a handgun, the presumed murder weapon, was found near the father, Wilson said.

He said initial evidence suggested a domestic disturbance. Investigators are checking records to see if there had been any prior domestic violence calls made to the house.

The family has not been officially identified but Richland County property records show the Millers owned the house. Friends also identified the dead as the Miller family.

The children's grandmother went to check on the young family after she hadn't heard from her son for a number of days, Wilson said. She immediately called police after discovering them dead.

According to property records, the Millers bought the lovely home in the Riverwalk neighborhood in 2012.

Wilson said the forensic team were trying to determine when the four were killed.

Bible study: A friend of the family, Rachel Hinson, 25, described them as a good family and said she had attended bible study at the home

Family friend Rachel Hinson, 25, described them as a good family and said the children were both under the age of five.

She told the Observer she had attended bible study at the Millers' home and went to Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses with them.

'It's confusing, and it's not understandable why something like that would happen,' said Hinson, who's grandmother lives near the home.

South Carolina is the worst of all 50 states when it comes to domestic homicides, according to a report by the Violence Policy Center in Washington.
