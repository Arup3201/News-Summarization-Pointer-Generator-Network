They went on air in the middle of Hurricane Sandy – despite being forced to record their shows without any audiences.

And TV kings Jimmy Fallon and David Letterman are preparing to make another comeback tonight, to be joined by late night rival Jimmy Kimmel.

ABC’s late night host Kimmel, 44, had planned to do the entire week from the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, but Hurricane Sandy forced him to scrap the plans last night.

David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon shows go on despite having no audiences

However, he tweeted that he would be back on air tonight, saying: ‘unless something weird happens, tonight's show in #Brooklyn is ON like fleece on Gov Christi.’

Tonight’s guests are Howard Stern, 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan and musical guest Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, who are all confirmed to appear.

Meanwhile, Fallon, 38, will film from his studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan with guests, outspoken billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, reality TV host Andy Cohen and musical guest Trey Anastasio.

And a CBS spokeswoman told MailOnline Letterman will go on tonight with guests, meteorologist Jim Cantore, filmmaker Ken Burns and singer Andrew Bird.

Guests scheduled for the rest of Kimmel's week on the east coast include Chris Rock, David Letterman, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert – both of whom axed their Monday night shows.

David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon were forced to tape their programmes without audiences on Monday night.

Fallon tweeted this picture saying: 'Midtown NYC is empty, but we are still doing a live show! @sethmeyers21, @padmalakshmi & @imaginedragons #LateNight NBC. Might be a sleepover!!'

The pair both used the situation for comedic value in their opening monologues, with Letterman kicking off: 'We're in the middle of Hurricane Sandy and we have no studio audience, but we do have quite a show for you tonight. Thank you for joining us in the Ed Sullivan Shelter.'

Referring to the hurricane, which caused devastation up and down the East Coast, Letterman told his viewers: 'If I were home, I'd be boarding up your television sets, because this is the stuff that's gonna hurt somebody.'

But the fears over the hurricane didn't stop one courageous guest - Denzel Washington - who arrived for his interview wearing a bright yellow raincoat.

Asked how he had made it to the studio, Denzel replied: 'Only for you, Dave. I swam!'

Meanwhile, over on Fallon's show, the comedian decided to begin his show by venturing outside the studios, battling against the wind and rain as he talked directly to the camera.

He told the viewers: 'I'm hoping, if you're watching, you are at home, you're safe, you're warm...But we're here.'

Continuing his monologue as he headed inside, the camera then panned around to show the audience-free studio.

Earlier, Fallon messaged guests Padma Lakshmi, Seth Meyers and Imagine Dragons: 'Midtown NYC is empty, but we are still doing a live show! Might be a sleepover.'

The array of TV shows that film in New York were banned from setting up amid in the storm’s devastating aftermath.

Affected shows show include The Good Wife, Person of Interest, 30 Rock, Smash, Special Victims Unit, Celebrity Apprentice and 666 Park Avenue.

Alongside this, most networks axed scheduled planning on Monday night to make way for rolling news coverage.

Early ratings results from Nielsen raings have also been delayed until further notice.

That means we’ll have to wait to see how well Dancing with the Stars fared opposite all that Sandy coverage on The Weather Channel.
