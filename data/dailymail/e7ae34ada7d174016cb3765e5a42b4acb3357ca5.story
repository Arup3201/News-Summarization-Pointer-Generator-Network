Attack: Energy Secretary Ed Davey accuses climate change sceptics of being 'blinkered'

Emergy Secretary Ed Davey last night launched an attack on ‘dangerous and destructive’ climate change sceptics.

The Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister accused ‘publicity-seeking’ critics of ‘selectively misreading’ the evidence so we can ‘all relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want without a care’.

In a speech at London’s Institute of Physics, he said they had ignored a recent survey that suggests 97 per cent of experts agree on the human link to global warming.

‘Just three per cent question man’s contribution. Three per cent,’ he said.

‘Let me quantify that for you.

If this was a general election vote, 97 per cent of the vote would generate 630 MPs, the three per cent just 20...’

He added: ‘To coin a phrase, “it’s the science, stupid”.’

Mr Davey, who said it was vital for Britain to lead the world by cutting its carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, also blamed the Press for giving an ‘uncritical’ platform to global warming naysayers.

‘This is not the serious science of challenging, checking and probing.

This is destructive and loudly 
clamouring scepticism born of vested interest, nimbyism, 
publicity-seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered, dogmatic, 
political bloody-mindedness,’ he added.

He said those questioning climate targets were ‘absolutely wrong and really quite dangerous’.

‘The science tells us we cannot afford to relax, let up or wait for a miracle,’ he added.

Environmental
 policy is a major faultline between the coalition parties, with the 
Conservatives against onshore wind turbines and green regulations that 
they claim will harm businesses.

Former
 Conservative minister David Davis said the claim that scientists are 
united in the belief that global warming is driven by human activity 
‘simply does not stack up’.

‘The
 last thing Britain needs at a time of rising energy bills is an Energy 
Minister who uses dodgy statistics and alarmist rhetoric to justify even
 more massively flawed green energy policies,’ he added

An energy firm involved in controversial shale gas fracking is sitting on up to 19 times more gas than previously thought.

IGas said there could be up to 172.3 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas in a 300-square mile area in Cheshire for which it holds licences, rather than its original estimate of 9Tcf.

Andrew Austin, iGas’s chief executive, said only 15 per cent of the gas might be recoverable, but could make the UK less dependent on gas imports for up to 15 years.

It plans further research into prospective shale gas resources in the East Midlands and the Weald Basin in the south of England.
