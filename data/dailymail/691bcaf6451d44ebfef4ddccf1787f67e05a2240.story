Saido Berahino is almost certain to stay at West Bromwich Albion after the club refused to lower their £20million asking price.

Liverpool and Tottenham have both made initial enquires regarding a move for the England striker.

Sportsmail understands both sides are willing to fork out between £10-12m for the forward this month.

But the Baggies have been steadfast in their valuation of the striker, insisting he will not leave the Hawthorns for a penny under £20million.

As it stands Liverpool and Spurs are unwilling to budge on their own respective valuations, meaning the 21-year-old is highly likely to stay.

Manager Tony Pulis is unlikely to consider allowing Berahino leave late in the transfer window, as he would want ample time to secure a suitable replacement.

Berahino's future could well become the subject of more speculation at the end of the season, but for now he is likely to stay in the Midlands.

Meanwhile, West Brom have seen a £5million offer for Leicester striker Jamie Vardy rejected.

New Baggies boss Tony Pulis has identified the forward as potential signing this month as he seeks to beef up his attacking options.

The Baggies were contemplating an improved offer on Monday night.
