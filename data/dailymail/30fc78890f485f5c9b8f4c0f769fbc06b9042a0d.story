Vivienne Westwood has been accused of lifting passages for her new autobiography from the work of another author.

Paul Gorman, who wrote The Look: Adventures in Rock and Pop Fashion, claims to have identified 40 sections of Westwood's new book which have been used without crediting him. 

He claims her self-titled autobiography is 'riddled with inaccuracies' and cites two instances where passages from his work are represented as the fashion icon's own words - once in direct quotes.

Mr Gorman is set to sue Picador, publishers of the book, Vivienne Westwood and co-author biographer Ian Kelly.

Vivienne Westwood has been accused of using parts of Paul Gorman's book 'The Look' without crediting him 

'There's been a wholesale plagiarism,' said Mr Gorman. 

'I got a copy of the book and spent four hours pouring over it and I was just astonished. 

'I greatly respect Vivienne Westwood's achievements but the book is riddled with inaccuracies.

'It's a really sloppy book. It's a shoddy piece of work and she doesn't deserve it. She is a fascinating woman whose story deserves to be told properly.' 

The autobiography Vivienne Westwood was published earlier this month by the iconic fashion designer

Mr Gorman said he has identified 40 parts of the book that seem to have been lifted from his own work, released in 2001, in the more than 400 page volume by Westwood and Kelly. He said he is credited eight times - less than 25 per cent and is currently 'making legal representations' through lawyers to the publishers. 

The writer said he is talking to lawyers about making an approach to Picador, which is part of Pan Macmillan, Ian Kelly and Vivienne Westwood about making a claim on the basis that his work 'has been plagiarised.'

He claims two examples appear to represent quotes he used from Malcolm McLaren, the 73-year-old fashion designer's former business partner and lover, as her own words.

He added: 'These are the most extreme examples. One in direct quotes and one in indirect quotes from Vivienne Westwood.' 

On his blog, Mr Gorman claims the passages below are an example of a direct lift from his book. On page 22 of The Look he quotes McLaren as saying: 

'Just look at what people like Jack Kerouac were wearing after they had left the marines and the army and went on the road. 

'White T-shirt, jeans and leather jacket.'

Mr Gorman claims an almost identical quote appears on page 85 of Vivienne Westwood, with the quotes attributed to the designer.  

He also claims there are several examples in the autobiography, which was released last week, that do not accurately credit photographers. He also said there are a number of inaccuracies such as incorrect spellings of 'Jimmy' Hendrix.

'I don't have any problem with Vivienne Westwood, I have a problem with the publisher,' added Mr Gorman. 

I've written books with the likes of Boy George who are outspoken people. Vivienne Westwood is entitled to say what she wants, but the publisher's job is to publish a book that does not make this kind of error.' 

Mr Gorman said despite requesting a preview copy of the autobiography there was no response from Pan Macmillan. 

He said he now owns the rights to his book after these were recently handed over by the publisher.  

Pan Macmillan also faces claims that it may have libeled associates of the former designer. Private Eye says the book includes a libelous comment about a former manager who Westwood claims is ‘now dead.’ That would mean he could not sue for libel, but according to the Independent the man is actually still alive. 

A spokewoman from PanMacmillan said: 'We always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and will, where appropriate, correct them. We can also confirm that we have not received any formal communication regarding the content of the book.'

Westwood and co-author Ian Kelly have not responded to requests for comment from MailOnline.
