More than one in five drivers say they have been penalised because they do not understand 'confusing' parking signs

More than one in five motorists have had their cars ticketed, clamped or towed away because of ‘confusing’ parking signs.

Some drivers avoid trying to park in areas where the signs are most prevalent, the poll by car insurers Churchill found.

More than four out of ten of the 2,001 people polled said parking signs in their area were confusing, while a third avoided parking in their local town or city centre for this very reason.

Almost one in ten even don’t risk parking near their home because of confusing signs.

More than a quarter say areas near their home have multiple restrictions in place on the same street and almost a third think signs in their local authority area do not clearly indicate to which area the restrictions refer.

Drivers avoiding parking in town centres due to sign confusion was most rife in London where nearly half of motorists admitted not even attempting to park in the heart of the UK capital.

The next most shunned town centres are in the north west of England, followed by the east of England and south east England.

Wales and north east England are the areas where motorists are most happy to attempt to park in town centres.

The study says that overall a fifth of motorists have received a parking fine in the past two years as a result of not understanding the parking restrictions in that area.

Some one in 20 of those have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the same period, as a result of parking sign confusion. Some drivers have endured one or more of these.

Clamping on private land was outlawed two years ago but is still legal in certain circumstances by local authorities, the Government’s DVLA and bailiffs.

In London alone last year some 8,273 cars were clamped on-street by local authorities, of which 8,167 were in Kensington and Chelsea, which is also the biggest for car tow-aways at 6,524.

Churchill Car Insurance head Steve Barrett said: ‘It’s the driver’s responsibility to check which parking restrictions are in operation in a particular area.

‘However, when there are multiple restrictions in operation on a single street, it can result in motorists being confused and unintentionally parking illegally, incurring fines that could have been avoided.’

The findings come in the week that ministers announced that the use of CCTV ‘spy cars’ to catch people who park illegally is to be curtailed.

They will no longer be allowed to routinely send out automatic tickets.

Instead parking wardens will instead have to fix tickets directly to windscreens, making it illegal for councils to issue penalties to drivers using just the CCTV spy cars currently used for on-street parking enforcement.

However, councils will still be able to use the CCTV to issue postal tickets for any offences that occur on critical routes, such as those near schools and bus lanes, bus stops and on 'red routes'.

The partial ban is being introduced following a three month to rein in 'over-zealous parking enforcement practices', which the Government says has forced people to shop in out-of-town centres or online, and give motorists and local shops a ‘fairer deal’.

Ministers say the move will rein in ‘greedy councils’ who use the method of fining as a ‘cash cow’, and bring to an end the “plague” of tickets being issued by post.
