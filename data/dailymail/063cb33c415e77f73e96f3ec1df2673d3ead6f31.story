Coronation Street actor Chris Fountain has been urged to make a public apology on television following revelations he performed vile raps about rape and violence in a series of YouTube videos.

The TV star has already been suspended from the ITV soap after the 25-year-old was shown wearing a Halloween mask and using pseudonym The Phantom to spout lyrics about bombing houses and stabbing people in the face with syringes.

He has also issued a statement apologising for his actions, stating: 'I would like to 
sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed 
by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour.

Controversial: Coronation Street actor Chris Fountain has been umasked as controversial YouTube rapper The Phantom  

'The videos were made 
over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done 
anything like it since and nor will I.’

But now bosses of the show are urging him to speak out on a television show such as Daybreak or This Morning in a bid to appease fans better.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'These videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation. But while they are furious, they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly...

'He is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on TV to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him.'

The source also reveals he may have to make an apology on several TV shows to reach a wide audience, or he might even hold a press conference about the scandal to prove he's sorry.

In one distasteful clip, Fountain raps about dragging a girl upstairs, and adds: ‘I will **** anybody up in the worst way, rape a b***h on her birthday.’

In another clip the actor performs a 
stabbing action while he raps: ‘I’m a nasty ****, I will punch you in 
the face and you look like you’ve been having some acupuncture ’cos my 
fist is lethal.

‘I’m a ******* hero, you’ve got ******* zero. I’m a mother******* demon, I’ll stab you in the face with a needle.’

Fountain,
who finished runner-up in the third series of celebrity skating show 
Dancing On Ice in 2008, also raps about being fed up with fame as he 
lounges on a sofa with local rap group the West Yorkshire Cypher.

‘****
with me and you don’t want to risk it, I’ll play you like a board game.
I’m bored of fame so I’m taking the rap game, remember the name, it’s 
******* Phantom,’ he raps.

Last
night a spokesman for support service Rape Crisis said: ‘This is yet 
another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some 
men.

‘To dignify this with 
the name “music” does music an injustice, but the far greater injustice 
is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual 
violence against women.

‘If 
these violent and hate-filled lyrics were directed against other groups 
in society, they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated 
as a crime.’

Faye Maxted, 
chief executive of The Survivors Trust, said: ‘He is a high-profile 
character. It shows a complete lack of any kind of respect for women at 
all.’

Coronation Street producers have since suspended him from the show, in which he has played mechanic Tommy Duckworth since 2011.

An
ITV spokesman said: ‘ITV finds the language used and the views 
expressed in this video totally unacceptable. Chris Fountain has been 
suspended pending further inquiries into this matter.’

The
former Hollyoaks star has changed his YouTube privacy settings to try 
to ensure the five videos – already seen by thousands – can no longer be
viewed.

However, other versions had been uploaded yesterday, meaning they were still widely available for viewing.

An
official Twitter account belonging to The Phantom, which reportedly 
contained a tweet in which he boasts about killing a rap rival, has also
been hastily removed.

However,
there were still pictures of the actor on the West Yorkshire Cypher 
website yesterday, among images of members of the group smoking what 
appear to be cannabis spliffs.

Fountain first came to notice as Justin Burton in Channel 4 teen drama Hollyoaks, before taking part in Dancing On Ice.

In
Coronation Street this year his character featured in a prominent 
storyline when his on-screen girlfriend became a surrogate mother in 
order to pay her debts.
