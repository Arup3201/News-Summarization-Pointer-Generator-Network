A high school senior was barred from her prom after she showed up to the dance wearing a dress emblazoned with the Confederate flag.

Texanna Edwards, 18, wasn't allowed to go inside last Saturday with other students because of her choice of gown that she had helped design.

The dress - red, knee-length and covered with blue stripes and white stars - was deemed 'inappropriate and offensive' by teachers at Gibson County High School in Tennessee.

Controversial: Texanna Edwards, 18, wasn't allowed into the dance at Gibson County High School in Tennessee because of the gown that she had helped design

Miss Edwards told Msnbc that she thought the dress was 'cool' and wanted her dress to look like the Confederate flag because she lives in the south. 

She said: 'We kept asking people walking inside - 
black and white - and everyone said they loved it.

'Two black women even 
went off on the principal. They were upset with the principal. No one 
was upset with me.'

Director of schools for the region  Eddie Pruett said there have been episodes of racism at the school in recent years and that the principal believed the dress may have caused a problem. 

Miss Edwards had been told by teachers that if she went home and changed she would be allowed into the school dance but she decided against it.

Her family had spent around $500 on the specially designed dress along with the teenager's hair and make-up. 

The
 18-year-old added that students at her school often wear T shirts and 
belts with the Confederate flag and it has never been an issue before.

The
 13 stars of the Confederate flag represent the southern states who 
attempted secession from the United States during the Civil War, and 
where slavery was legal.

The
 Confederate States set up a government from 1861 to 1865, but were 
eventually defeated by northern states in the U.S. Civil War.

The
 13 stars on the Confederates Flag represent the states of South 
Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, 
Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri.
