Just a few years ago, finding an England football fan openly supporting the German team would have been almost unheard of.

So it is perhaps surprising that, during the World Cup final, English fans will be flocking to support the old rival Germany against a newer rival in Argentina.

Sir Geoff Hurst, England's hat-trick hero of 1966, has already pledged his support, as has UK Prime Minister David Cameron, as Germany's stylish football and impressive attitude has won the country over.

In a final between two old enemies of English football, English fans seem to be backing old rivals Germany over newer adversaries Argentina

Champions elect: The Germans played some scintillating football to beat hosts Brazil in the semi-final

Together: The German performances and team spirit has drawn support from English fans

Hurst told the Sun on Sunday: 'I know England supporters will be shocked to see me backing the Germans but they are the tournament's best team.

'They are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined, strong and proud.'

While
 the Argentinians are capable of playing with flair and style, 
particularly when Lionel Messi performs, the Germans have been excellent in Brazil, particularly in their semi-final annihilation of the hosts.Â 

David
 Cameron is also lending his support to our European neighbours, though 
it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with Chancellor 
Angela Merkel.

Mr
 Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in Wednesday's 
crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark
 Rutte 'furiously'.

But after the Dutch crashed out on penalties Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans.

Seventh heaven: The German's 7-1 thrashing of Brazil sees them go into the final as favourites

England and Germany have plenty of history, both on and off the field.

Alf Ramsey's side beat the Germans 4-2 in 1966 to win the World Cup, thanks 
to two controversial goals from Hurst - one which hit the bar and bounced over the line, and another at the end of 
extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch.

It
 was Germany who knocked England out of the last World Cup, beating 
Capello's side 4-1 in 2010, inflicting England's heaviest World Cup defeat 
thanks in part to a disallowed goal from Frank Lampard.

Of course, in terms of real-world rivalries, the two World Wars are what made Germany into the enemy in the first place.

For German fans, a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly-men, making the semi finals or finals of the last four World Cups without a win

If Argentina were to emerge victorious it would mark the third World Cup win in the country's history

Meanwhile, 
on the Argentine side, the Falklands war and the still-bitter argument 
over the islands has done nothing to endear English minds to the 
prospect of an Argentine win.

On
 the pitch, Diego Maradona's 'hand of God' moment, when he scored 
against England from an unpenalised handball in 1986, still sticks in 
the memory, as does the memory of Diego Simeone hitting the turf after 
being tapped on the leg by David Beckham in 1998.

Given the animosity that most England supporters feel towards the two nations, it is almost a shame that they cannot both lose.

But when it comes to picking a winner, it seems that the English are choosing to back the Europeans over the South Americans.
