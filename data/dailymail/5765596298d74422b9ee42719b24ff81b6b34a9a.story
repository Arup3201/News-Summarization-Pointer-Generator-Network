Harry Soames, 29, from Notting Hill, London, has been banned from driving after crashing his BMW while twice over the legal drink-drive limit 

The son of Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames crashed his BMW while still almost double the drink-drive limit the morning after drinking a mixture of wine and vodka cocktails, a court has heard.

Harry Soames, 29, from Notting Hill, London, was arrested after his vehicle spun out of control on the M23 near Crawley and collided into the central reservation.

The crash took place less than eight hours after Soames had stopped drinking at his father's home in Handcross, West Sussex.

Appearing in the dock at Crawley Magistrates' Court today, Soames - who is also the great-grandson of Winston Churchill - admitted he had been 'frightened' by the ordeal and said that ht was 'truly sorry'. 

Soames, the eldest son of the Tory Mid Sussex MP, pleaded guilty to driving while over the legal limit.

He said: 'I am deeply and truly sorry for the incident that occurred, and I'm greatly relieved that no one was injured.

'It was a profoundly frightening experience which I never wish to repeat, and one in which I have learnt valuable lessons.

'Unfortunately, there was an error of judgement approximately seven hours after I stopped drinking.

'I did not knowingly get behind the wheel of the vehicle drunk, nor would I ever do so.'

The court heard how, after the crash, Soames drove over to the hard shoulder.

He was then arrested following a roadside breath test which revealed he had 56 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath in his system. The legal limit of 35.

Prosecuting, Martina Sherlock said: 'On November 29 just before 7.50am, it seems Mr Soames was driving a BMW on the M23 northbound near Crawley, close to Junction 10.

'There was a road traffic collision whereby he crashed into the central reservation; there were no other vehicles involved.

'The car he was driving spun out of control and once it came to a stop he managed to get over to the hard shoulder.

'15 minutes later police arrived at the scene, having been called. Mr Soames admitted being the driver of the vehicle at the time.

'A roadside breath test was required of him due to the collision and it tested positive for the presence of alcohol. He was subsequently arrested.'

In police interview, Soames, who works for a security company, said he misjudged moving across the lanes of the motorway.

Ms Sherlock added: 'He says he stopped drinking at 12.30am that morning. However, prior to that, he had a few glasses of wine and a few vodka cocktails at his father's house in Handcross.'

The defendant already had three penalty points on his licence after being convicted of using a mobile phone while driving in January 2013.

Sentencing him to a 12-month disqualification, chair of magistrates Ron Adams said: 'It's clear that you are deeply in remorse and ashamed of what you have done, and to some extent surprised that the alcohol stayed in your body for that period of time.

'It does show, however, that alcohol can affect the actions of a driver, and in this case you were lucky that neither yourself or any other road user was seriously injured in this matter. It could have been so much worse.'

Soames agreed to take part in a drink-drive course which, if he completes successfully, will reduce his ban by three months.

He was also fined £300, and ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

People are more cautious than ever about drink-driving - but most people are unaware that even three glasses of wine could mean you are over the limit the following morning.

Alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream from the stomach and the small intestine and is carried to the liver. Among its many other jobs, the liver acts as a filter to remove poisons from the body.

The liver produces chemicals called enzymes, which break the alcohol down into other chemicals. These, in turn, are broken down, until all that is left is carbon dioxide and water, which pass out of the body in urine.

It takes about an hour for the body to process a unit of alcohol - but there are numerous factors which can affect this (picture posed by model)

This generally takes about an hour for every unit of alcohol. To play it safe, it's best to start counting from the time you finish drinking. 

For example, if you have 20 units of alcohol and stop drinking at midnight, it's going to be 8pm the following day before it is out of your system.

If you drink three 250 ml glasses of 14 per cent strength wine (10.5 units) and call it a night at midnight, in theory it will be 10.30 the next morning before you are no longer under the influence.

But this rate can vary depending on factors including weight, gender and medication in your system. 

Liver disease expert Dr Nick Sheron, head of population hepatology at the University of Southampton, warns there is a range of complicating factors that can play havoc with the one-hour-per-unit calculation.

He said it makes any attempt to work out when it might be safe to drive the following day a dangerous lottery.

For a start, he says, blood alcohol is determined by your body fat distribution and weight: fatter people actually have less water content in their body.

Water in the body helps to dilute alcohol - hence the blood alcohol level would be more concentrated and higher in an overweight person than in a person of normal weight.

Women also have lower levels of a chemical called alcohol dehydrogenase - an enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the liver - so it takes a woman longer than a man to get the same amount of alcohol out of her bloodstream.

Medication can also complicate things. Aspirin and birth control pills, for example, interfere with the liver's ability to break down alcohol, slowing the process.
