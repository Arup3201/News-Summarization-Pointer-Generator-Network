A celebrity-loved beauty brand is helping combat the opium trade in Afghanistan by offering heroin suppliers alternative and better paid jobs.

Dr. Hauschka manufacturer WALA Heilmittel founds and supports initiatives in developing parts of the world to encourage organic farming and economic self-sufficiency.

With 80 percent of the world's heroin supply coming from Afghanistan, WALA believe it is essential to offer the people an alternative means of securing a livelihood. 

Full of roses: Organic beauty brand Dr Hauschka is helping combat the opium trade in Afghanistan by offering heroin suppliers alternative jobs as rose oil farmers

This project comes as it was revealed that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan grew to an all-time high despite America spending more than $7bn (£4.3m) to fight it over the past decade.

An Afghan government official says that Taliban and opium smugglers are fighting for the income of opium in different parts of the country, while cultivation takes place mostly in the south and southwest where insurgents are highly active and the government has little influence. 

In October 2004, a project for producing rose oil was established by German Agro Action and now 400 farmers are growing Damask roses on 60 hectares of land as an alternative to growing opium poppy.

The idea sprung from an initiative in Burkina Faso, Africa, where WALA helped local women establish sustainable agriculture cooperatives to produce shea butter.

Go organic: The production of rose oil is an ancient tradition in Afghanistan and the rose oil is used in products loved by A-listers

Those cooperatives now provide all the certified organic shea butter WALA needs to manufacture its Dr. Hauschka skincare products. 

After the success of that, they did the same with roses and chose Afghanistan because the production of rose oil is an ancient  tradition there.

Dr. Hauschka, whose products are loved by Gwyneth Palrow, Madonna, Kate Upton and Jessica Alba, swears by the power of plants to renew and help maintain health.  

Organic beauty is big business right now.

Elaine Robinson, Dr.Hauschka Head of Training and Esthetics, believes so. She said: 'Natural skincare is the essential partner to a healthy lifestyle. If you are conscious about your diet and what you put inside your body, then it goes without saying that you would only want to put the very best products, made of the highest quality natural ingredients on your skin.'

Margo Marrone, Co-Founder of The Organic Pharmacy, added: ‘We are what we eat and we should all know how poisonous pesticides are so not eating them is easy to understand but our skin is also a living organ and just like the digestive system - it absorbs molecules in skincare that can be potentially harmful.

'That’s why we choose organic herbs and plant extracts in our skincare; going organic for skincare is so important because it not only is healthier but also the skin looks more healthy and beautiful.'

The celebrities are catching on too. Miranda Kerr has a successful organic skincare line called Kora Oragnics full of rosehip oil and noni fruit, while Louise Redknapp's Wild About Beauty range is paraben-free and packed with German chamomile and organic rose water.

Emma Reinhold from the Soil Association said: 'We believe that organic beauty products are better for people and the planet. It's as simple as that. Certified organic beauty products contain an incredible wealth of plant extracts which have amazing skin caring benefits and do not contain harsh synthetic ingredients which can be damaging to the skin.

'Organic beauty is not just about choosing products that are better for your skin, it’s about making a choice to care for the world around you. The ingredients such as rose, lavender and chamomile that are used in your pot of moisturiser or your body wash were grown without pesticides, which is better for wildlife and also protects the farmers and workers who come into contact with those ingredients.

'Buying organic also means farmers get a better deal and workers are paid a fair wage, helping them look after themselves and their families (many ingredients are grown in developing countries where poverty is a daily problem). The saying miracle in a bottle is overused in the beauty industry but organic beauty really is that -not just in terms of product performance but the way the bigger picture is part of every product you buy.'
