Luxury goods tycoon Francois Pinault has snapped up Vidal Sassoon's former Los Angeles home for a bargain price of $16.5 million.

The modern five-bedroom property - which boasts spectacular mountain, desert and city views - was carefully renovated by the late  hairdressing legend Sassoon and his wife, Ronnie.

It originally hit the market last November priced at $17.99 million just months after Sassoon passed away aged 84.

The purchase means that Mr Pinault, 76, who is based in France, can spend more time with his son  Fran√ßois-Henri and daughter-in-law actress Salma Hayek.

The jet-setting couple spend much of their time in California along with their five-year-old daughter Valentina.

Highlights of Sassoon's former 6,400sq ft abode include an outdoor swimming pool, hot tub and media room.

All of the rooms boast contemporary wood furnishings and floor-to-ceiling windows.

The building sits on 5 acres of landscaped grounds, punctuated with mature trees and shrubbery.

London-born Sassoon - who pioneered the bob-cut hairstyle in the Sixties - purchased the property on Mulholland Drive in 2004 for $6million according to records.

It is often referred to as the Singleton House as the industrialist Henry Singleton commissioned architect Richard Neutra to design it in the mid-fifties. It was completed in 1959.

In need of some minor work Sassoon, who was a great fan of 
architecture,  installed new terrazzo floors and removed a number of walls in order to create open plan interior spaces.

He previously told the Architectural Digest. that the house 
reminded him of the 'euphoric' Sixties.

Sassoon died May 9 2012 following a long battle with leukemia. The recent sale was initiated by his widow Ronnie Holbrook.

According to Take Sunset it isn't the first time the home had been put on the market and the couple had been trying to sell it since 2007.

It was listed for $20m in 2007, but failed to attract buyers, It then reappeared in February 
2009 with an asking price of $14.995m.

Its new owner Mr Pinault is one of the richest men in France. In 1963 he founded the luxury goods company PPR, which is now run by his son.

The conglomerate currently manages brands including Gucci, Stella McCartney, and Yves Saint Laurent.
