The recent sky-rocketing Swiss Franc has left skiers flocking to new locations to enjoy the high-roller experience without the snowballing costs - and where better than Italy's Alta Badia region in the Dolomites.

Impatient travellers eager to hit the slopes only seconds after landing will also be happy to note that it's just a two-hour drive from Venice.

But it's the Sellaronda, the staggering rock formations at the heart of this must-see ski region, that's the real draw, and are as breathtaking as they are intimidating.

Seasonal snowbirds have begun flocking to Italy's Alta Badia region in the Dolomites, known for its exceptional views and fresh powder

The area itself is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage site and has over 500 kilometres of pistes spread over four valleys: Alta Badia; Arabba; Val Gardena; and Val Di Fassa.

One of the skiing highlights is a 42 kilometre loop of slopes around the Sellaronda which offers mouth-wateringly panoramic views of the valleys below. 

Just as well, as there are a number of excellent places to eat and drink along the way.

The loop links the four valleys, encouraging experienced thrill-seekers to ski the clockwise route, while those still getting their bearings are best going the other way.

No matter your preference, you'll be happy to learn that the whole loop can be accessed with just one ski pass, though it will take up to six hours to complete, so it's best to set out by mid-morning.  

When you're ready to take a break, make sure you stop in for lunch or a glass of wine at Rifugio Emilio Comici on Piz Sella, one of the many peaks along the loop.

The 42 kilometre loop around the Sellaronda also offers a bevy of mouthwatering food and drink options, like Rifugio Emilio Comici

It is well known for its seafood dishes and fresh fish that is driven up daily from Grado, near Venice. 

It also has an eye catching wine list and the locally-produced Sauvignon Blanc in a must try. 

The Rifugio is easily reached by lunchtime if you are on the anticlockwise route, but if you have a big group it is worth calling ahead to book the day you plan on going.

Early birds will be happy to note that a ski cats are available to ensure that you reach the top of the mountain first

For those eager to hit the slopes, ski cats are available to book to ensure that you reach the top of the mountain first.

You'll also get the added bonus of experiencing the sun rise over the valley below. 

And don't worry about grabbing breakfast before you start out on your early morning adventure.

A delicious spread is available at the Las Vegas Lodge hut, located at the peak of the Alta Badia Valley, where rooms are also available.

While there is no shortage of chalets to choose from, the five star luxury (and beautiful views) of Rosa Alpina Hotel & Spa is hard to beat

The cosy interiors of Rosa Alpina make for a perfect, relaxing end to a high-energy day on the mountainous slopes

And for those looking to soak their tired muscles, the swimming and spa facilities boast some of the best that the region has to offer

While there are many chalet options available in all four of the valleys, many require visitors to commit to one week's rent, often from Saturday to Saturday.

However, for those preferring a long weekend away, adventure travel company Ski Solutions offers several alternative packages.

Best of all, Ski Solutions' staff are all experienced skiers and snowboarders to help you get the most out of the area and offer tips based on your skill level.

And for those looking to splurge, you'll be hard pressed to find accommodation more luxurious than Rosa Alpina in the village of San Cassiano.

Nestled in the Alta Badia Valley, the laid-back five-star hotel offers stunning views, friendly staff and exceptional spa facilities to soak your tired muscles at the end of a long day.

The bedroom interiors vary throughout the hotel, but all include beautiful wood accents and cosy carpeting and linens

What's more, its restaurant, Restaurant St Hubertus, offers wonderful local cuisine.

Even for those who opt to stay elsewhere, a visit to the chef Norbert Niederkofler's space is well worth your time.

What was once a small pizzeria has been completely transformed into a two star Michelin rated experience, which works with local farmers in the area to create seasonal menus showcasing the area's freshest ingredients.

Rosa Alpina Hotel & Spa is located in the town of San Cassiano and offers plenty of dining, drinking and apres ski options

And if you'd prefer to grab a bite in town, Maso Runch Hof, in Badia, which boasts a six-course meal comprised of traditional Ladin dishes.

There are two apartments in the house, which dates back to 1720, and has been run by the same family for centuries, serving up classic recipes of barley soup and knuckles of pork.

Ladin, the local language, is only spoken in these particular valleys and is reminiscent of German, Italian and Latin.

But irrespective of your native tongue, there's no denying that the area's food and wine trails, coupled with amazing ski terrain, offers a one of a kind adventure for snowbirds looking to spread their wings.
