Rapper R. Kelly could be facing jail time after allegedly falling behind on child support payments.

The Ignition hitmaker is accused in court papers filed Thursday by his ex-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support he owes.

The singer’s lawyer says  the R&B star, who has gone underground, could face jail time, according to New York Post gossip column Page Six.

The Ignition hitmaker is accused in court papers filed Thursday by his ex-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support he owes

Last year he fell more than $100,000 behind in payments but managed to pay the debt off.

Kelly previously has owed millions in unpaid taxes and even had to auction off one of his homes.

Kelly — whose latest album, Black Panties, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in December, is his biggest success since 2009.

One of Kelly’s lawyers has told his team that if the singer doesn’t appear at a March 27 hearing in his child-custody battle in Chicago, a judge could give him 30 days to six months behind bars because Kelly didn’t show up at a November hearing.

'The judge was clear in November that he wasn’t happy R. Kelly didn’t show up,' said a source. 'His lawyer is worried the judge could lock Kelly up if he doesn’t show this time, but he can’t reach his client.'

Despite his troubles, Kelly is 'in a bunker' and 'unreachable'

'There’s a line of people Kelly owes money to who worked really hard on his last album,' another source said. 'Who knows what Kelly and Devyne are doing, but burying your head in the sand isn’t the answer.'
