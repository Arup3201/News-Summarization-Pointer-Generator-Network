Loss: Jennifer Andrus, 16, was killed alongside her sister and mother by her father on Tuesday

A father who shot dead his wife and their two daughters before turning the gun on himself just hours after he was fired from his job will be buried alonsgide the family he slayed.

David Andrus, 50, killed his 48-year-old wife Jeana in the basement of their home in Darien, Illinois on Tuesday before going upstairs and shooting his daughters Jessica, 22, and Jennifer, 16.

He shot his family in their faces before shooting himself and his body was found on top of one of his daughters, Richard Jorgensen, DuPage County Coroner said.

As the community tries to come to terms with the horrifying crimes committed by a man they called a 'loving father', it has emerged the family will be buried together.

Mrs Andrus's father, John Infanti, told the Chicago Tribune: 
'That's the way my daughter would have wanted it, and that's the way I 
want it. They had 28 good years together. You don't just forget that.

'Something happened to make him snap 
and, in a tragic moment, a lifetime disappears. But he's not that 
person. They're still a family and they'll be together.'

He was completing funeral arrangements on Thursday, the newspaper noted.

David Andrus was fired from his job 
at manufacturing firm Midtronics on Tuesday morning on suspicion of 
theft, the Tribune reported. The company said he was fired for 'cause' 
but would not provide further details.

The family lived with two of Andrus's nephews at the house, which was owned by his mother Betty before her death last year.

One nephew fled to a neighbor's house for safety while another was at work during the killings.

Neighbor Rachel Steinhaus told reporters that she heard one of the nephews arguing with his uncle on Tuesday afternoon.

Later that day, she heard a pop and said she assumed the nephew was slamming his car door before driving away.

When police were seen surrounding the house, she called one of the nephews at work, who was unaware of what had happened.

Jennifer was a member of the class of
2015 and bowling team member at Hinsdale South High School while her 
sister graduated in 2011.

Jennifer's friend William Crubaugh 
told the newspaper that Andrus 'spoiled' his daughters while family 
friend Rita Johns said the father was 'a loving and dedicated dad'.

Stephen Turner, Jeana Andrus's former
boss at the USA Skate Center in Romeoville, said the company would 
donate money towards the family's funeral costs.

He said Mrs Andrus was fun-loving and generous, despite the family's financial hardship.

Infanti said he was left baffled by the horrifying deaths, but said his son-in-law could have snapped after feeling 'inadequate'.

'Maybe he thought, "My God. How can I support my kids?" That could have been the trigger,' Infanti said. 'What went through his head... I wonder if we'll ever really know.'
