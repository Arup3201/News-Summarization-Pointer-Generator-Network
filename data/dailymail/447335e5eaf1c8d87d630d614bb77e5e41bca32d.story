My outfit had been chosen carefully — a beautiful deep pink and purple top and smart black trousers. Never had I been so excited about attending a party.

All my friends would be there, my ‘gang’ of the past eight years. We had so much news to share. After months away, I hoped they’d be as excited to see me, as I was to see them.

I was just putting on my make-up, when a cursory glance at my email stopped me in my tracks. It said: ‘If you come tonight, we will leave.’ The message was from a woman I’d been friends with for years.

Prejudice: Mary feels let down by friends who were hostile towards her when she returned from weeks nursing Ebola victims in Liberia

‘Not everyone accepts that you’re not a risk and we think it’s best if you don’t return to the group for another two months.’

The hostility was like a slap in the face, and tears soon followed. I cancelled my plans and the blouse was consigned to the back of my wardrobe.

What had I done to deserve this cruel treatment from the people I loved dearly?

The truth will shock you: I am a nurse with the international relief group, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and had just returned from Monrovia, capital of Liberia in West Africa, where I’d spent weeks nursing Ebola victims.

On duty: Mary in protective gear

If dealing with the daily horror of this terrible disease wasn’t difficult enough, the ignorance, prejudice and paranoia of people back home — the very people whose generosity these sufferers are dependent on — has stunned me.

I just hope it doesn’t deter other volunteers from going out to help.

I’d been extremely careful since my return three weeks ago. Although my chances of developing the virus were minuscule due to MSF’s meticulous hygiene procedures, I didn’t want to worry people. So I stayed at home until the incubation period passed and I had a certificate of all-clear from Public Health England.

It just so happened that my ‘release date’ coincided with the party — a party I’d now been effectively barred from.

I’d grown used to some of my friends and family thinking I was mad for working in such terrible conditions when, as a trained nurse and midwife, I could just get a job in a local hospital.

I’d started going on aid missions in 1998. I didn’t want accolades, I just wanted to do my bit and as a single woman with few obligations, I felt I should.

During the past 16 years I’ve been to some of the world’s most difficult areas: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Sudan, and most recently, Liberia. I’ve survived warzones, had a gun held to my head, almost died from typhoid, contracted malaria and witnessed unspeakable suffering. Yet I’d never felt as hurt as I did in that moment.

In Monrovia, I’d spent six weeks in the largest Ebola centre the world has seen. While I was away I was unaware of the fear that had disseminated across the UK, leaving people panicking that Britain, too, was about to be gripped by an Ebola outbreak.

It doesn’t matter how often you reassure people, those images of sick and dying children remain fixed in their minds. Some of my MSF colleagues have reported the same reaction from their communities. One doctor, who’d previously been praised for going on aid missions, returned from West Africa to find he was now viewed as a threat.

And a recent news story revealed how a healthy nine-year-old boy, who had recently been in Sierra Leone with his aid-worker mother, was banned from attending a school in Stockport amid parents’ fears about their children catching ebola, despite the fact he’d been screened by the Health Protection Agency.

The fears are completely unfounded. Infection control measures with MSF were paramount. Touching infected patients was forbidden and we were instructed to keep at least two metres apart from staff, patients and visitors.

It went against all my instincts. As a nurse, I wanted to reach out to people, to comfort them, especially women in the throes of labour as well as ebola, but I knew I couldn’t risk breaching the strict rules in place.

Mary worked 12-hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing with her friends when she returned

Yet among the many harrowing scenes there were positive moments.

One young man called Orlando was carried, critically ill, into the tent where I was working. His eyes had the awful ‘ebola look’ I came to recognise — extreme fatigue combined with primal fear. Yet a few weeks later, he walked out proudly clutching his survivor’s recovery certificate.

Unfortunately, survivors often faced onward battles. Many were driven home to their villages in an MSF car, only to be treated as outcasts.

I had no idea I was about to get a taste of this myself. I’d worked 12-hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing over a few lattes and catching up on news and much needed hugs. If only!

Shortly before departure, I received my first inkling of the stigma to come. An email from my two lodgers at my home near Barnstaple in Devon, informed me they would be moving out for three weeks. It was nothing personal, they said, they’d been instructed by their workplace to avoid me.

I knew the fears were unfounded, as ebola is spread only by the bodily fluids of an infected person, but I respected their decision.

Official guidelines from Public Health England said isolation wasn’t necessary, but I wanted to prove I wasn’t a threat. I took my temperature twice a day and a close friend agreed to be on standby to drive me to an isolation unit, in the highly unlikely event of me becoming unwell.

Shortly into my self-imposed quarantine, I spoke to a doctor friend on the phone.

‘Who’s taking your temperature?’ he questioned.

‘I’m taking it myself,’ I replied.

‘Well, you could easily fudge that!’ he retorted.

I was incensed. Why would anyone think I’d deliberately put anyone’s life at risk by falsifying my temperature readings. I explained I had to be symptomatic to be contagious, but he saw no need to apologise.

His comments really stung. I couldn’t believe it — especially from a medical professional. Another aid worker I know was told she couldn’t pick up her grandchildren from school.

I haven’t returned to the group who excluded me from the party, because while the majority are happy to accept me, some have made it clear they would still walk out.

I just wish they’d pick up the phone instead of hiding behind an email. Because the only way to combat ignorance and panic is through true scientific facts.

Her experience has given Mary an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors who are shunned by their own communities

Unexpectedly, all this has given me an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors. My suffering is nothing compared to theirs, but I can now identify in a small way with their rejection. I’m planning to return to Liberia this month and I’ll feel honoured to share their experiences.

MSF have provided amazing emotional support and I have some loyal friends, too. Liberian survivors aren’t nearly so fortunate. I won’t let people’s ignorance stop me, but next time I come home I won’t be crushed by their attitudes.

This experience has flushed out my true friends from those who just pay lip service.
