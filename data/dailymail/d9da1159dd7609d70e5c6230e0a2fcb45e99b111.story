A freak dust devil caught hipster sunbathers unaware in Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon.

The whirlwind of dirt and dust formed on the baseball field at McCarren Park in Greenpoint at around 3:30pm.

The park has been dubbed the ‘hipster beach’ by locals and there were plenty on hand with their smartphones at the ready to capture the unusual phenomenon that lasted about a minute.

One hipster who captured the moment was 
Michael Gambale, who can be heard screaming ‘holy cow’ at the start of 
his short video of the incident.

A freak dust devil caught hipster sunbathers and baseball players unaware in Brooklyn at the weekend

A whirlwind of dirt and dust formed on the baseball field at McCarren Park, in Greenpoint, dubbed the 'hipster beach' by locals

A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a meter wide and a few meters tall) to large (more than 10 meters wide and more than 1,000 meters tall)

Conditions in the park on Sunday were ideal for a dust devil, which according to NASA typically forms 'on a clear day when the ground is heated by the sun, warming the air just above the ground'

‘Some dude ran into it, that's why I said don't run into it,’ Gambale told Mother Jones. ‘And he did! He just got all dusty. It wasn't that strong obviously.’

A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a meter wide and a few meters tall) to large (more than 10 meters wide and more than 1,000 meters tall). The primary vertical motion is upward.

Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.

'As heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler air above it, the air may begin to rotate, if conditions are just right.’
