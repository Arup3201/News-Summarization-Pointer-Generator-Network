Three decades after it all began, Jamie Redknapp was back on AFC Bournemouth’s training pitches on Monday. The session being put on by the Championship leaders’ young manager Eddie Howe was familiar, but the setting was not.

‘I have enjoyed watching Eddie work,’ enthused Redknapp ahead of Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup visit of struggling Liverpool. 

‘He’s bright and full of ideas. I don’t think the methods have changed that much over the years. The modern drills are a variation on themes of what managers have always done.

‘This place — this pitch — has changed a lot, though. When I was here as a young player we didn’t have our own training pitches. This land was the council’s and we just trained on whatever bits we could, once we had cleaned the dog mess off. We would save the best patch of grass until Friday and call it Wembley.

‘I remember when Bournemouth beat Manchester United here in 1984. My dad was manager and I was in the crowd. The next day the lads were in training and in good spirits but the council warden was annoyed they hadn’t asked permission so he locked the gates so they couldn’t get out.’

Almost 31 years after that victory over then cup holders United, opportunity knocks again for Bournemouth tomorrow at their impressively remodelled Goldsands Stadium.

‘The pitch used to face the other way when I played here,’ mused Redknapp as he gazed out across the immaculate playing surface.

‘At least the away fans are under cover now. It’s just as well. It could be a long night.’

Liverpool certainly head to Dorset under a darkening cloud. Sunday’s Barclays Premier League defeat by Manchester United was the latest blow to a team that came so close to winning the title in May.

With Brendan Rodgers’ team short of goals and unable to keep a clean sheet, it is difficult to make them favourites against a side that has not lost since September.

‘I don’t think Liverpool will keep a clean sheet here,’ said Redknapp. ‘I don’t think many clubs would. This lot are a good side.

‘I was chatting to Eddie and he was telling me how he likes to play attacking football on the front foot. I like the way he uses his full-backs going forward. Eddie is looking forward to this and I can see why.

Harry Redknapp started his managerial career at Bournemouth in the 1980s and son Jamie made his professional debut for the club as well 

‘If he picks his first 11 then this will be every little bit as hard as the game at Old Trafford for Liverpool. It could be harder.’

Redknapp, of course, played for both tomorrow night’s competing clubs. AFC Bournemouth was his second home from the moment his dad Harry took over as manager in 1983. He used to skip school — his mum never knew — to join in training sessions at the age of 12 before he finally made his first team debut as a 16-year-old in 1990.

Just 13 league games in, he left for Liverpool after Anfield manager Kenny Dalglish pestered Redknapp senior as he tried to dance with his wife Sandra at a managers’ function.

‘I didn’t see the positives for Liverpool on Sunday that other people did,’ reflected Redknapp. ‘I never at any point thought they would win. They are devoid of all confidence. It’s sweeping through the team.

‘And now they have resorted to playing without a centre forward. That’s a bad situation. The players they have bought haven’t been good enough. Not yet, anyway. It hasn’t worked and Brendan must take responsibility for that.

‘Football management is so fickle. I was asking Eddie about his targets earlier and he said he looks no further than three games ahead. He’s right.

‘A few months ago Brendan was manager of the year and now look at the pressure he is under.

‘I don’t think they should change him. That would be madness. I like Brendan, I think he is good. But he has made mistakes this season and he is suffering for them

‘It’s been humbling for him. He just needs to ride the storm but there will be no bigger test than this one here.’

On Monday, Redknapp was clearly glad to be back on familiar ground. Former club-mates such as Matty Holmes and Steve Fletcher — who has a stand named after him — are now on Howe’s staff and greeted him with warm hugs, as are a handful of players the Bournemouth boss played with in the 1998-99 team.

Howe has clearly endeavoured to foster a local spirit here. Round the back of one stand, an outside wall is adorned with wonderful team photos of Bournemouth sides from years gone by.

Redknapp finds his own vintage and points out team-mates Luther Blissett, Tony Pulis, Shaun Teale and Gavin Peacock.

Then he spots a huge portrait of his father as a player.

‘Blimey, look at that dreadful haircut,’ he smiles, patting the image fondly on the chest.

Redknapp credits the club with shaping his personality as well as his life. As he walks around the pitch with Howe on the way to training, the stands are being cleaned in readiness for tomorrow.

‘We used to do that as apprentices,’ Redknapp said. ‘And we painted the stand, too. The edges look straighter now.

‘I cleaned Luther’s boots. He used to throw them back at me and ask me to do it again. He was toughening me up. Dad’s assistant Jimmy Gabriel taught me how to do an over-the-top tackle, taught me to look after myself.’

It was a trip down memory lane for Redknapp, who spent time looking at pictures of former Cherries - like George best (left)

Redknapp made sure to stop off and talk to some of the club's current apprentices, and share some advice with the young players

Redknapp spent five hours catching up with old friends and memories. As well as watching first-team training, he also asked to visit two groups of apprentices in their classroom and left them with one piece of sage advice. ‘Save some money and look after your family,’ he said.

Back to playing matters, there are rumours that Howe will rest players tomorrow night and if he does, Redknapp thinks Bournemouth will lose.

As we spoke in a room off the players’ tunnel, however, a photo on the wall depicted Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard being tackled during last season’s FA Cup tie on the south coast.

The words next to it say: ‘Anything is Possible.’

Liverpool should perhaps heed the warning.
