A football player accused of beating a former teammate into a coma left custody today as it emerged that he allegedly kicked the man in the head because he was enraged that a bouncer had kissed his girlfriend's hand.

Rutgers University quarterback Philip 
Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, was 
charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of 
third-degree assault.

He left custody on Tuesday with a towel over his head less than 48 hours after the alleged attack took place in Mankato, Minnesota.

Isaac Kolstad, a 24-year-old married father, was 'sucker-punched' by an unknown attacker before Nelson allegedly kicked him in the head 'like a soccer ball' in the early hours of Sunday following a graduation celebration.

Former Minnesota quarterback Philip Nelson leaves the Blue Earth County jail with a towel on his head

Nelson posted $20,00 bail in his assault case stemming from a fight outside a bar that left another former football player in critical condition with head injuries, in Mankato, Minnesota

Authorities say Nelson kicked Isaac Dallas Kolstad, 24, in the head after another man punched and knocked him to the ground early Sunday as bars were closing in Mankato

Unfortunately for Nelson, the towel blew off his head as he left the Blue Earth County jail. He did not want to speak to reporters

According to a criminal complaint seen by NJ.com, 20-year-old Nelson was angry because a bouncer at a bar had hit on his girlfriend and he is extremely protective of the young woman.

Nelson's girlfriend told police that as they left the bar, they saw Mr Kolstad outside. The bouncer and Mr Kolstad are different people.

Nelson and Mr Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer who had seen surveillance tapes.

Police had released surveillance video of events surrounding the altercation and they are asking for the public's help.

Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that
 a man in a black shirt came 'out of nowhere' and punched Mr Kolstad in 
the head after he had left a bar in the early hours of Sunday.

She said: 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet. He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.'

Rutgers quarterback Philip Nelson allegedly assaulted a former teammate from the University of Minnesota on Saturday

She added that the sound of Mr Kolstad hitting the concrete was so loud because he didn't catch himself.

Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State-Mankato, had surgery to relieve swelling in his skull at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato.

It
 is yet unclear if he has suffered permanent brain damage. According to 
the criminal complaint, a neurosurgeon said that he was unsure Mr Kolstad will survive the attack.

He has bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. Kolstad's skull fracture was on the left side of his head where he was kicked.

Nelson, with his hands and feet shackled, was arraigned earlier in the 
day on first-degree and third-degree assault charges, NJ.com reported. A judge set 
Nelson's bail at $20,000. He then left the
 Blue Earth County jail less than 48-hours after the attack trying to 
mask his identity, but failed when a gust of wind blew the towel up.

Rutgers announced Tuesday that it has dismissed quarterback Philip Nelson from its football program.

Mr Kolstad is married to Molly, a nurse, who is pregnant with their second child. The couple already have a three-year-old daughter.

He graduated in December with a degree in business management and works in sales at Fastenal, an industrial distribution company.

His father Blaine told WCCO that his son had been out with friends on Saturday night celebrating his graduation when he was attacked in a busy downtown area.

He was found at an intersection around 2am on Sunday by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance.

On a CaringBridge
 fundraising page, the father wrote: 'He had one surgery today to put a 
pressure gauge in his skull. He may need additional surgeries in the 
coming days. We do know that his brain did sustain permanent damage.'

Witnesses
 said that Mr Kolstad, who was described by a friend as 'a quiet, young 
man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in 
the South Street Saloon in the downtown area just before closing time. 
Mr Kolstad was found by police half a block from the bar.

The
 family said in a statement: 'We are extremely grateful for the 
outpouring of support we have received during this difficult time.

'Isaac
 is a very strong and determined young man, who is dearly loved by his 
family and friends. We would respectfully ask for your continued 
prayers.'

His
 sister Rebekah also tweeted: 'Please everyone who reads this pray for 
my big brother Isaac he is in ­critical condition and needs your prayers
 to help him survive.'

'We are in the process of gathering information on the situation and reserve comment until the legal process is complete,' Rutgers Senior Associate Athletic Director Jason Baum said in a statement, NJ.com reports.

A vigil was held on Sunday night for Kolstad. Police were looking for a second suspect and reviewing surveillance camera footage in the area. 

Nelson, 20, was taken to the Blue Earth County jail, according to a police statement. A message left with Nelson's parents Monday was not immediately returned.
