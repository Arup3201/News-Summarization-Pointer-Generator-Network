The lake is believed by some to have healing powers, and in the 1940s, wealthy Peruvians would travel to the location to bathe in its waters

This mystical town is contained within a sea of sand and is completely encompassed by the brutal environment surrounding it

The lake is naturally formed, but there is a legend that a young princess was bathing when she was discovered by a hunter and fled, leaving behind a pool of water. Her flowing cloak was said to have created the surrounding sand dunes. 

Now, descendents of the Inca people make their living by hosting guests coming from afar to climb to the top of a wind-sculptured sand dune and watch the sunset illuminate the golden landscape, before sailing down the slopes on rented sandboards or dune buggies.

Fear not if you have visions of stumbling around lost in the desert, with a few droplets of water left in your flask. 

The paradise Huacachina is situated a handy 4km from the southern city of Ica, a former Spanish colonial town located on the borders of the desert.

When you arrive at the 'Oasis of America,' one of the last oasis' in North and South America, you are greeted by the sights of rustic hotels, quaint shops and even an oasis library, surrounding the blue lagoon.

The luscious town was popular with wealthy Peruvians in the 1940s, who used to come to bathe in the lagoon, as it was thought the waters had healing powers

The picturesque village is even featured on the back of the 50 Nuevo Sol note (Peru’s official currency). Like most deserts, the temperature is typically hot, sunny and dry with very little rain. 'High season' falls between May and August, which is winter time for the region

Tranquil waters contrast with the barren surroundings in the Peruvian settlement. The area has been declared a national cultural heritage site, by the National Institute of Culture, and it is hoped that this tranquil oasis will never become a mirage in the desert

Although there are many stories how the oasis was created, one version states that the rolling sand dunes were created around the pool when an Incan princess fled her bath after being discovered bathing by a young hunter

Legend has it that a beautiful Incan princess was discovered bathing by a young hunter. When she fled and the pool of water she left behind her became the lagoon. 

She fled and the folds of her mantle streamed behind her, creating the surrounding sand dunes.

Due to landowners building wells to access groundwater, coupled with evaporation during summer high temperatures, the lagoon water levels have dropped over the past few years. 

In an effort to combat this, water has been pumped into the the lake from Ica for Huacachina inhabitants.
