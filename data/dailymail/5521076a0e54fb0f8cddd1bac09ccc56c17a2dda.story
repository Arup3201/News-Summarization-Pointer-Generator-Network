DNA testing has lead the investigators to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, who was charged with first-degree murder on Monday

A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a young woman who was found stabbed to death at her Florida home five months ago.

Nicole Franco, 19, who worked as a pastry chef at the Boca Raton Resort & Club, was murdered in her own bed on June 3.

DNA testing has lead the investigation to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, a neighbor at the gated Bridgewater Place apartments in Oakland Park.

Tucker was charged on Monday with one count of first-degree murder.

According to the sheriff's department, Tucker entered Franco's ground-floor apartment through a sliding door and grabbed a knife from her kitchen.

He then went into Franco’s bedroom and took her wallet from her purse.

As he turned to leave, Tucker accidentally stepped on the purse, which awoke Franco.

Police said a startled Tucker then stabbed Franco multiple times in the chest.

Tucker allegedly told police he watched Franco dial 911 before fleeing and throwing the wallet into a lake behind the apartments.

During the 911 call, Franco told the call-taker someone had broken into her house and beat her. However, she fell unconscious before she could provide more details.

Deputies arriving to the apartment building had to go door-to-door at 4:11 a.m. to find Franco’s apartment. They eventually noticed the open sliding glass door and discovered her body.

Tucker had entered the Fort Myers Youth Academy, a juvenile facility in Lee County, on September 17 on another matter.

On Thursday, Tucker's DNA was found to match DNA evidence taken from Franco's bed. He was arrested the next day on suspicion of murder.

Detectives searching Tucker's family's apartment have also found a knife with blood on it in the building's stairwell.
