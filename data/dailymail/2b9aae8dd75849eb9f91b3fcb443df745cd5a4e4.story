A baby who was born at 25 weeks when her teen mother was shot and killed in a botched robbery has finally been released from hospital and her little lungs are breathing on their own.

Lailani Casara entered the world far too early on Christmas Day 2013 when doctors delivered the 1 pound 10 ounce baby by emergency cesarean as her mom Eva Mae Casara took her last breath.

Kept alive on a ventilator, she had a better chance of dying than living, but she has defied the odds and after five months in the neonatal intensive care unit at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Chicago, she is now being cared for at home by her great grandmother and aunt.

Lailana weighs a healthy 7 pounds now and is fed with formula through a tube in her stomach.

She is tethered to oxygen most of the day to strengthen her lungs, according to the Chicago Tribune, but she is able to breath on her own.

'Everything now is geared toward that baby,' her great-grandmother Fannie Casara told the Tribune, adding that in between naps and feeding they tell the little girl about her mother.

On December 25, Eva Mae was picked up by her boyfriend, 16-year-old Anthony Lee, and his half-brothers Diante Coakley, 21, and Darius D. Marshall, 19 to take part in a robbery, police say.

But the intended victim ended up driving away with the pregnant teen in the car, prompting the brothers to shoot at the vehicle and one of the bullets flew through the window and pierced the back of Eva's head.

Her boyfriend and his two half-brothers are in jail facing murder charges.

A passer by found the teen lying in blood in the snow and she was rushed to hospital, where she was in shock and bleeding profusely.

The baby's heartbeat dipped lower and lower to a near-death 30 beats per minute, according to the Tribune.

This compared with the typical 120 to 160 beats per minute of a healthy fetus. Emergency room physicians performed CPR as obstetricians raced to cut the baby out of her abdomen - which took them just 30 seconds to deliver.

The lead obstetrician, Dr. Fouad Al-Qawasmi, said the baby would certainly have died if Eva had arrived just 10 minutes later.

But saving the infant was bittersweet, he told the newspaper.

'She won't
 see her baby,' the father recalled thinking during the procedure. 'We 
saved one, but we're not going to save the other.'

As devastating as their loss was, Eva Mae's sister Autumn Vargas said there was no time to grieve.

'You can't even break down,' the 35-year-old said. 'Because there's this pretty baby in front of you. And she needs you.'

The family didn't approve of Eva's boyfriend, and wanted her instead to go back to school and graduate so she could attend college.

Once upon a time she wanted to be a doctor, they said.

Casara said she was elated when she found out shortly before her death that she was having a little girl, after being initially frightened when she found out she was pregnant.

Kathy Graal, a neonatal intensive care unit nurse who cared for the tiny Lailana when she was delivered Christmas night, said she nor any of her colleagues thought the baby would survive, given how dangerously early she was delivered.

Doctors remain concerned she may suffer setbacks in her motor and cognitive skills given the trauma surrounding her birth.

But her loving family take heart in the fact she mimics their facial expressions and grabs for her toys.

All they want for her now is a normal life, starkly difference from the violence she was born into.Â  'Normal. That's what I hope for her,' Vargas told the Tribune. 'A normal, beautiful life.'
