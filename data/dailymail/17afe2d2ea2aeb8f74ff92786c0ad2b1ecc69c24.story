A plane was forced to return to the tarmac at Heathrow soon after takeoff after an unexpected engine surge yesterday.

The United Airlines flight from Heathrow Airport bound for Chicago had to be sprayed with water by firemen to cool the engine.

This is the third incident in ten days which has seen a United Airlines plane having to make an emergency landing.

No passengers were harmed in the incident at 4.30pm yesterday and a BAA spokesperson said the incident had a minimal impact on the traffic.

The news comes but a week after two United Airlines flights departing New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport had to make emergency landings after experiencing problems with their engines.

Last Sunday, United Flight 409 bound for Seattle returned to the airport at about 9.15am Sunday after reports of possible smoke in the cabin and cockpit.

A United spokesman says the flight crew noticed an unusual smell in the cockpit and it went back to the tarmac.

On Saturday night, a United flight to Germany carrying 173 passengers and crew had to return to the airport after experiencing engine problems.

Flight 96, which was departing from Newark Liberty Airport to Berlin, landed at about 8.10pm on Saturday night after a ‘mechanical issue with the engine,’ airline spokesman Joe Micucci said.

Federal Aviation Administration, said one of the engines on the Berlin-bound flight apparently overheated on takeoff.

Witnesses on the ground at Newark International reported seeing fire coming from the engine shortly after liftoff.

No injuries were reported in any of the emergency landings.

A United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline yesterday's incident at Heathrow was due to 'an issue with the engine' and that all passengers will be re-accommodated to flights today.
