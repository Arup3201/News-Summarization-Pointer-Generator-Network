On paper they could hardly be more different - the hippie lifestyle of a relaxed surfer, and the strict routing of an ultra-orthodox Jew.

But these incredible photos seek to shatter both stereotypes - by showing how one man has combined the two.

Writer and surfer Gai Shtienberg captured the two passions of one Jewish man's routine - his devotion to religion and his irrepressible love of surfing.

Gai Shtienberg captured the life of an ultra-orthodox Jewish man's life as he balances his devotion to religion and his love for surfing

The images in Shtienberg's article show the different sides of 34-year-old Meir's life

A photo essay, originally featured on popular surfing blog The Inertia, subverts stereotypes by showing the different aspects of 34-year-old Meir's life.

And it shows how the faithful believer reconciles his strict religious beliefs with the laid-back life of someone who loves to catch waves.

Meir said: 'As long as the sea and the waves fascinate me so much, I will keep on surfing...together with studying the bible.'

Writer Gai spent six months observing
the man's life, and learning how he keeps his faith while enjoying 
surfing, which he began when he was 12.

Meir said: 'As long as the sea and the waves fascinate me so much, I will keep on surfing...together with studying the bible.'

In one instance, he is sporting a wetsuit and hat and catching some waves - a pursuit he has enjoyed since 12-years-old

In
one photo, Meir wears a wetsuit and a hat and riding some waves, while 
in another he is observing a conservative dress code and engaging in his
religious studies.

Another powerful photo shows the father-of-six - who met his wife Nava in the Philippines - holding his surf board above his head, dressed in traditional Jewish clothes.

One of Gai's shots shows the father clutching his board while wearing a skullcap as a child, perhaps one of his own, gazes up at him.

Another shows the 34-year-old on a 
skateboard, playfully riding it in the road in front of a group of 
conservatively dressed children.

In another, he an be seen taking a picture of a woman and two children, who beam as they sit on swings.

The 34-year-old father-of-six has learned to reconcile his ultra orthodox life with the wild past-time of surfing

Orthodox Judaism demands that followers attend Synagogue three times a day - but that doesn't stop Meir from being playful with his children

The photos subvert the stereotype of the ultra orthodox Jewish life, showing the family relaxed, playful and enjoying their hobbies

Orthodox Judaism demands that followers attend Synagogue three times a day, and most will wear some sort of skullcap all day.

Often the male followers also wear a black suit and grow a beard.

They respect Shabbat - which means honouring Saturday, the day of rest, y not doing any work - including operating any electrical machinery or driving a car.

Their dietary laws mean they typically only consume Kosher foods - the practise of Kashrut - such as not eating 'unclean' animals such as pork, not mixing meat and milk, and avoiding food that has not been ritually slaughtered by a licensed and trained religious Jew.

Traditional Jewish law also preaches family purity, which forbids sex with a Niddah - a woman who is menstruating, or who has menstruated and not had a ritual cleansing bath.
