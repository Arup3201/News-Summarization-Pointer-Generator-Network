Altering a gene in mice has made them live 20 per cent longer - the human equivalent of living to 95-years-old, according to scientists.

Scientists lowered the expression of the gene mTOR, which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism.

While the mice lived 20 per cent longer, the effect was not uniform, says journal Cell Reports, with different organs and tissues affected in different ways.

Researchers from America¿s National Institutes of Health said the study could be used in new therapies for age-related diseases that target specific organs, such as Alzheimer¿s

For example, they retained better memory and balance as they aged, but their bones deteriorated more quickly.

Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health say the study could be used in new therapies for age-related diseases that target specific organs, such as Alzheimer’s.

Dr Toren Finkel said: 'While the high extension in lifespan is noteworthy, this study reinforces an important facet of ageing; it is not uniform.

'Rather, similar to circadian rhythms, an animal might have several organ-specific aging clocks that generally work together to govern the aging of the whole organism.'

He said that further studies were needed to identify exactly how ageing in these different tissues is connected at the molecular level.

The mice were engineered to produce 25 per cent of the normal amount of mTOR, which researchers say is the minimum required for survival.

They were smaller than average but otherwise normal.

Their median lifespan was 28 months for males and 31.5 months for females, compared to 22.9 months and 26.5 months for normal males and females, respectively.

The mTOR mice also had a longer maximum lifespan; seven of the eight longest-lived mice in this study were mTOR mice.

This lifespan increase is one of the largest observed in mice so far.

The study found that while the GM mice aged better overall, they showed only selective improvement in specific organs.

They outperformed normal mice of equivalent age in maze and balance tests, indicating better retention of memory and coordination, and also retained more muscle strength and posture.

But they had a greater loss in bone volume as they aged, and they were more susceptible to infections at old age, suggesting a loss of immune function.
