A recent spate of unusual weather hasn’t changed the question on the minds of many – ‘what about a white Christmas?’

Chances are that if there is snow on the ground now, it will stick around the next two days. The Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes are a virtual lock. The rest of the US may not be so festive.

A white Christmas is defined by there being at least one inch of snow on the ground, according to the Weather Channel.

Widespread: Snow is possible for a wide swath of the northern half of the country, but most of it is not expected to amount to any sizable accumulation

Too warm: It is simply too warm in most of the country for snow to fall or stick around

Most of the Northeast has little shot at a white Christmas. Warmer than average temperatures the past few days – highs eclipsed 70 degrees Sunday in New York – and abundant rain have washed away any snow there may have been.

Temperatures will cool back to around freezing by the holiday, but no snow is forecast for most of the region except areas normally affected by lake effect snow.

The mountains of northern New York state and New England are already packed with snow and received mainly ice during this weekend’s storm. They should be white come Wednesday.

The mid-Atlantic and southeast have virtually no shot at snow in the next few days, nor is any on the ground. Significantly above average temperatures and recent rains washed away any hopes those states may have had.

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow: The northern Great Lakes are the region most likely to have a white Christmas - it will be snowing Christmas Day

Slight cooling: Temperatures will back off from record weekend highs, but not enough in most places for snow

The northern central US is already buried in snow and ice. It should remain so for at least the next few days. Expect to ring in the holiday with sleighs and snow balls from Omaha to Chicago, all the way up to Minnesota and North Dakota.

Further west into Montana and Wyoming, as well as all of the Rocky Mountains, a white Christmas is virtually guaranteed. Significant amounts of snow are already on the ground and aren’t expected to melt by the time presents are open Wednesday morning.

As usual, the West Coast will not have a white Christmas. What the region gains in mostly amazing weather the rest of the country envies, they give up in having snow on Christmas.

Parts of the Southwest have a very good chance at a white Christmas, but they are confined mostly to the mountains and higher elevations. Don’t expect snow in Las Vegas.

The good news is that despite the lack of snow on the ground, most regions will have a beautiful day to celebrate the Christmas holiday – only the upper great lakes are expected to receive any significant precipitation.

It is expected to be snow.

The Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes are a virtual lock - so is extreme northern New England

The Great Lakes will see snowfall on the holiday

The rest of the country is unlikely to be as fortunate
