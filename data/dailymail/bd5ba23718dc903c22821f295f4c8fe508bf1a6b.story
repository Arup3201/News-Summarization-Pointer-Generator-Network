Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned Australians to expect more attacks like the one which has shattered the peace in Paris and resulted in the fatal shooting of 12 people at the office of a satirical newspaper.

In calling it an 'unspeakable atrocity', Mr Abbott urged Australians not to let the events 'change our way of life'.

'We have a strong presence in the Middle East to tackle the death cult at its source,' he said.

'The Paris shooting is an absolute atrocity but sadly we can expect more of this. We will defend our way of life, we will defend our values and freedoms.'

Tony Abbott condemned the barbaric act as an unspeakable atrocity but warned Australians on Thursday that they should be prepared for more terror attacks

Terrorists killed 12 people in the massacre at Parisian magazine Charlie Hebdo

Heavily armed men shouting 'Allahu Akbar' stormed the French headquarters of Charlie Hedbo on Wednesday, killing a dozen people in what French President Francois Hollande called 'undoubtedly a terrorist attack'.

The assault sparked a massive man hunt as the two gunmen managed to escape, executing a wounded police officer as they fled.

The weekly newspaper had a history of causing controversy with cartoons of Islam's prophet Mohammed.

In an earlier post on Twitter on Thursday, Mr Abbott labelled the attack an 'atrocity'.

'If you don't like something, you don't read it; you don't kill people you disagree with,' the tweet said.

Mr Abbott also said 'freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a free society' re-affirmed Australia's high terror alert.

'The Government condemns the atrocity in Paris overnight,' Mr Abbott's stated.

In a mass show of solidarity, thousands gathered in the streets of Paris to pay their respects to those killed

'The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of those who have lost their lives in this barbaric act.

'Australia stands with the people and the government of France at this difficult time.'

The attack comes less than a month after lone gunman Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage during a deadly siege in a Sydney cafe.

Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the violent conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16.

The Government condemns the atrocity in Paris overnight.

The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of those who have lost their lives in this barbaric act.

Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a free society.

The Government will continue to do all it can to protect our community from terrorism.

Our National Terrorism Alert level remains at High, which means a terrorist attack is likely.

Our security agencies are assessing the situation for security implications to Australia but there is no information to suggest that there is an imminent threat to Australia as a result of the Paris atrocity.

All Australians should remain vigilant, and again, I urge people who see or hear something that they feel is not right, to contact the National Security Hotline immediately on 1800 123 400.

Australia stands with the people and the government of France at this difficult time.
