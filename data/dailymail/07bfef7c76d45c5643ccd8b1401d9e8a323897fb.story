High blood pressure is the UK's biggest silent killer; affecting 16million people in the UK

At least one in four people with high blood pressure have abandoned their medication or take too little to combat their higher risk of heart problems, warn researchers.

A new study shows ‘alarmingly high levels’ of patients failing to take prescribed drugs, which may lead to them needing costly further treatment.

High blood pressure is the UK’s biggest silent killer; affecting 16million people in the UK, with many taking drugs.

It is estimated more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure.

Experts are calling for wider use of a simple test to determine whether patients are taking their pills, or if they are not working.

A study team from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and the University of Leicester used the test to analyse urine samples from 208 patients with high blood pressure attending a specialist clinic.

They had poor control of their condition or resistant hypertension, which meant they appeared not to be responding to drugs.

Of the group, 125 were new patients sent by their GP, 66 had poor blood pressure control and 17 had been referred for renal denervation, a kidney procedure to lower blood pressure when other methods have failed.

The tests showed one-quarter of patients either did not take their tablets at all or only occasionally - with 10 per cent not taking any tablets and 15 per cent just some of the time.

Patients with poor blood pressure control were least likely to stick to their medicines regime, along with those referred for the kidney procedure.

The less likely people were to take their medicines, the higher their blood pressure readings, says a report in the journal Heart.

The team said most patients with hypertension referred for extra hospital care ‘would routinely undergo many additional tests and procedures’ in a bid to find out why the drugs weren’t working.

Recent guidance from the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggested between a 
third and a half of medicines prescribed for long-term conditions are 
not used as recommended.

Professor
 Morris Brown, of the Clinical Pharmacology Unit at the University of 
Cambridge, in an editorial, said patients failing to take blood pressure
 drugs was a particular problem because they usually had no symptoms.

It is estimated that more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure (file picture, posed by model)

He said it was a ‘shock’ that 23 per cent of those referred for the kidney procedure had no detectable drug in their system, potentially wasting NHS resources.

Analysing urine samples could ‘solve at a stroke the problem of monitoring adherence and should rapidly transform practice’, he added.

Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said ‘Although this is a small study, it highlights a big problem.

‘High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart and circulatory disease.

‘Not taking prescribed meds means blood pressure levels are uncontrolled, which could increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.

‘If you’re thinking about stopping your medication because you’re experiencing side effects, make sure you talk to your GP.

‘They will talk things through with you and may suggest changes to your meds, which could help resolve the issue.’ A high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg).

The first figure, the systolic pressure, corresponds to the ‘surge’ that occurs with each heart beat while the diastolic reading is the pressure in the ‘resting’ stage between beats.

If readings are consistently at 140/90 or above, high blood pressure is diagnosed.
