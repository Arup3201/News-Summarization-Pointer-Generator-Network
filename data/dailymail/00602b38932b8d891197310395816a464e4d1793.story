TV magician and celebrity Paul Daniels' home was flooded this week after the River Thames burst its banks.

Gallons of floodwater cascaded into the TV funnyman's home which he shares with his partner Debbie McGee in Wargrave, Berkshire.   

Earlier in the day he tweeted advising neighbours to 'get inflatable paddling pools downstairs and dump everything you can into them. You will save so much stuff.'

He wrote: 'Thank you to all those who asked about our flooding but don't worry.

'We prepared for it. Interesting that in the last 10 years the Environment Agency have failed to control the waters, which were well predicted as going to come again.

'The water is still about 15" below 1983 around here. Fingers crossed.

'We are nowhere near as bad as some we are seeing on the news.'

However, judging by this aerial shot, the magician may have had to make a dash for it.

The home is now completely surrounded by water.

Estate agents have warned of the huge impact continued flooding of multi-million pound homes may have on some of the country's most expensive property markets.

Houses in the so-called 'stockbroker belt' along the River Thames suffered as flood waters have spilled into basements, ground floors and gardens today.

Exclusive addresses in Marlow and Cookham, Buckinghamshire, which count Heston Blumenthal, Sir Clive Woodward and Andrew Strauss among residents, were submerged leaving residents counting the immediate costs of insurance claims and repairing damage.

Andrew Milsom, director of Andrew Milson Estate Agents, warned that flooding could pose ongoing problems for the area's housing market.

'If a property has flooded in the past and the owners have needed to make an insurance claim, it does cause concern to people looking to buy,' he said.

'Insurance companies are becoming increasingly difficult - we sold a riverside property in Temple over the summer and the buyer went to 96 insurance companoes. Of those, less than 10 were viable and affordable quotes.'

He added that potential buyers would rule out properties without viewing them, if their postcode was classed as in an area at risk of flooding, regardless of its individual siting.

'They can make that decision from their home before they bother stepping through the door,' said Mr Milsom.

Peter Nicholls, director of Jacksons estate agents which is advertising the property, gave a more positive outlook.

'For some reason people buying a property next to the river are always surprised when the insurance company tells them it is on a flood plain,' he said.

'This has been quite a bad year as we have had a lot of rain, but with most properties the garden will flood and it is inconvenient but not too much of a problem.

'The pressure has been greater for us but the River Thames is quite controlled compared to other rivers. People on the River Severn would love to have a barrier and flood relief scheme like ours.'

Tim Peers, of Peers and Hilton estate agents in Shiplake, Berkshire, added: 'The only way you can really get insurance is by taking on the existing owners' insurance.

'I personally would have to say that I would not in a million years buy a house that I know floods every year - it is a horror story every year.'

Wales and South-West England are to 
endure more rain tomorrow, which will return again on Sunday -
 with a high chance of snow in the North.

Rising
 rivers include the Hampshire Avon through Wiltshire, Hampshire and 
Dorset, the Parrett in Somerset and the Severn through the Midlands.
