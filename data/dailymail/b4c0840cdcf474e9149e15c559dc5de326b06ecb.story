Ian Bell was handed the chance to take a massive leap from the periphery of England's one-day squad on Sunday to become their World Cup opener in place of Alastair Cook.

Eoin Morgan, the new England one-day captain, confirmed here in Canberra that it is the veteran Bell who will be given the first opportunity to claim Cook's place ahead of the more expansive Alex Hales when England begin a one-day tour that will culminate with the World Cup here next month.

Bell, who averaged 45 in 38 matches as Cook's opening partner over the last two years, will open in Sunday night's first warm-up game ahead of a triangular series against Australia and India here against a Capital Territory team along with Moeen Ali.

'The top three in the first game will be Ali, Bell and James Taylor,' said Morgan ahead of his first match officially in charge. 'The first opportunity goes to those guys. All three look in great form. Opportunity lands with them and we'll see how they go.'

There will be disappointment among many supporters who want England to replicate the aggressive cricket seen more readily among one-day opponents and are hoping that Cook's sacking would provide a prolonged chance for Hales.

But Morgan clearly echoes the view of the England coaches who want to marry experience with the younger more explosive talents in the England top order and are simply replacing the out of form Cook with Bell.

'Belly is a class act, somebody we've looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs,' said Morgan. 'He's pretty key at the top of the order.'

Morgan was appointed captain in a last-gasp move by the selectors when Cook ran out of chances to regain the form which he displayed in one-day cricket when he first took over from Andrew Strauss.

Bell's one-day career had looked in jeopardy but he was given a late reprieve after Alastair Cook's sacking

'It's been interesting,' said the Irishman of his early days at the helm. 'It took a bit if time to settle in but it's a huge honour to captain your country running into a World Cup. It's a massive opportunity given the side we have, which is brilliant. It's great to finally get started.

'Cookie was the first person to message me once I got the news, which sums up the guy. I've had a great relationship with Alastair over the last number of years when he's been captain. He's been fantastic to me. It is unfortunate the way it ended but it is the decision that's been made.'

Morgan does not believe there will be a great change in captaincy style. 'I don't think it will differ in a huge amount,' he insisted. 'There will be certain things Alastair will do that I wouldn't just because it is his character and mine. 

'When I've captained in the past I've tended to strip things back to the basics Keep things as relaxed as possible because things can conjure up into high-pressure situations and you want guys to be at their best when they make decisions. That's my method.

'Over the last seven or eight months I think we've seen a considerable change in the method that we've used both batting and bowling. That will continue to go in the same direction and guys will be encouraged to play with freedom.'

Kevin Pietersen's offer to play against England for the Australian prime Minister's XI in Wednesday's second warm-up game, presumably made tongue in cheek, was officially dashed on Saturday when Chris Rogers was called up to replace the injured Mike Hussey.

Pietersen made his offer while playing for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash and Morgan added: 'I think it was a very ambitious offer. It's a hugely prestigious game, for the Prime Minister's XI to give an opportunity to somebody who is not Australian is pretty ambitious. 

'When sides tour England and we put out Lions teams we give opportunities to our youngest and best. I don't think it would have spiced up the game at all if Kev had played. It doesn't really bother me.'
