Text messages that show a bride accidentally inviting a stranger to her wedding then trying to uninvite the guest - only to receive a message in reply that reads 'We still coming' - are fake.

Amy and Ian Hicks told People.com they were taking wedding photos in front of Detroit's Michigan Central Station while a music video was being shot nearby.

'Amy and I go off to the side and get a 
few pictures,' Ian Hicks told the website. 'Before I can even turn 
around my groomsmen are already over there talking to the guys. So our 
photographer was like, "All right, let's go over there."'

Nothing but fun: This photo of Amy and Ian Hicks, along with their wedding party, was actually taken when THEY crashed a music video for rap group 7262

Two different fake screenshots appeared online showing the 'accidental invitation' - one which said the bride's name is 'Kirsten' and another which claimed her name was 'Kristen,' Buzzfeed pointed out.

Accounts vary,
 but someone uploaded a photo of the Hicks' wedding party posing on the 
set of 7262's 'Anthem' along with the fake messages to social media.

Wedding 
photographer Adam Sparkes told MailOnline it was his idea to have the 
couple pose for photographs at Michigan Central Station.

'Initially I was just going to pull [Amy and Ian] to the side, I didn't want to get in their way,' he said, when he realized people were already there filming a video.

'We're
 on the other turnaround and [one of the guys from the video] says 
"Congratulations, beautiful bride, something like that."'

Sparkes said he told the rappers 'We're gonna come dance in that video' - and a man replied 'You should.'

'They were like 'Come on over,' he said. 'We crashed in on them.'

Sparkes said the now-viral photograph wasn't actually taken by him, but by someone standing behind.

Hoax: Two different versions of the fake messages appeared online

Sparkes said 7262 was 'pretty gracious' for letting him and the Hicks' wedding party join in on the fun.

'I went to EliteDaily and tried to dispel the myth,' he said. 'It was starting to feel like it was a little trope for people on the Internet - for a group of 20-something black guys to crash a wedding - but it rubbed me as being just a little unfair enough.'

Sparkes said the text messages were fake and '100 percent speculation.'

Asked by MailOnline about the reason for the hoax, Sparkes said he thought 'Someone just thought it would be funny - lulcat mentality.'

As for the idea Amy and Ian Hicks would text out wedding invitations, Sparkes said 'It's so far from these guys - they had a Colony Club wedding - they live in DC - they were not texting out invitations. It was black-tie and [was over a year] in the making.'

7262 later released the video for 'Anthem' in early July, featuring the wedding party as dancers.

Rapper Danta Norris, known by his stage name Mojo, told the Washington Post of the experience 'It's all cool that people making up what they make up. It's making it blow up more.'
