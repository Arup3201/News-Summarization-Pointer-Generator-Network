Ever wished your odd-shaped boiled egg could roll around your mouth with spherical ease? 

This unusual kitchen gadget promises to do that - because it will transform your oval egg into a round golf ball.

The Sports Huevos-Egg Shapers are perfect for sports fans wanting to serve dishes that feature the unmistakable shape of dimpled golf balls and were invented by design company Monkey Business.

The Sports Huevos-Egg Shaper is able to transform an oval egg into a spherical ball

Tee-time! After just a minute in the gadget your eggs will now look like perfect golf balls

To create the ball-shaped eggs you boil one for a few minutes then allow it to cool enough to be able to peel the shell off.

Once the shell is gone you place the warm egg in the shaper, squeeze it shut and submerge it in cold water for a few minutes to set.

As it cools the egg takes on the shape of the golf ball.

They also come in tennis and football varieties, and each pack of shapers costs £9.95 from Luckies of London.

Caroline Burman, from Luckies, said: 'Sports Huevos were dreamed up by Israeli design company Monkey Business.

'They come in three styles - golf, tennis and football.

'They're aimed at anyone who wants to make their breakfast more egg-citing. 

They make a great Easter gift for anyone sporty, even if it's an armchair tennis fan, she said. 

'To use them just boil an egg, peel off the shell and pop it in a Sports Huevos while it's still warm.

'Add the ball into a bowl or pan of cold water and leave for a few minutes for the mould to make an impression.

'The reaction to them has been fantastic.

'People love personalising their cooking, and it's a great little gift for sports fanatics at Easter - it certainly makes a healthier alternative to chocolate.'

The Karato - a carrot peeler resembling a pencil sharpener -  was launched by the same company last year 

The kitchen gadget is three-inches long and two-inches wide and can also be used to sharpen parsnips and courgettes as well as other similarly-shaped vegetables 

Monkey Business hit the headlines last year when they launched a carrot peeler in the shape of a pencil sharpener. 

The Karoto looks and works like an oversized pencil sharpener to peel vegetables such as courgettes and carrots or any similar-shaped vegetable such as the cucumber or parsnip.

Its creators also claim the time-saving invention is safer than slicing the skin off vegetables compared to a standard peeler or knife.

Karoto was designed by Avichai Tadmor for Monkey Business design studio in Israel.

His team claim the Karoto can completely peel a carrot in less than 30 seconds and say that not only does it save time but the shavings can also be used to decorate salads.

The kitchen gadget is three-inches long and two-inches wide and can also be used to sharpen carrots, for example, for presentation purposes.
