Lionel Messi's future at Barcelona has been thrown into doubt once more and club legend Hristo Stoichkov believes the Argentina international could leave the Nou Camp. 

Having missed Barcelona's Christmas open-training session on Monday, the club claimed Messi was suffering from gastroenteritis but reports in the Spanish press suggested the No 10 has argued with manager Luis Enrique twice since returning from his winter break in Argentina.

Messi was left out of Barcelona's starting XI for the trip to Real Sociedad on Sunday as the Catalan giants lost 1-0 to David Moyes' side.

Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona 'through the back door', according to Hristo Stoichkov

Stoichkov, who spent two seasons at Barcelona between 1996 and 1998, believes the club have regularly been unable to handle big-name  players who hail from outside of Catalonia.

Speaking to radio show Al Primer Toque, Stoichkov said: 'They have not known how to look after Messi.

'Tell me any foreign player who has not ended up leaving Barca through the back door.'

Neymar, along with Messi, was also allowed to return late from the winter break but Stoichkov insists neither were to blame for Sunday's defeat in Anoeta.

The ex-Bulgaria international said that neither Messi nor Neymar, who was also allowed return late from their winter break and then left out of the starting XI in Anoeta, were to blame for the defeat.

'Messi and Neymar are not the guilty parties, but those who gave them holidays,' 

'All players should be treated equally. If you give two days extra holidays, then play them and they get injured, that's a disaster.'
