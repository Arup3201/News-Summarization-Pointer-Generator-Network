He's not long started walking, but Prince Harry is already joking about training Prince George up for the London Marathon.

The prince, who is patron of the event, met people who will be running on April 26 to raise money for his charities at a training session at Twickenham Rugby Stadium today.

Harry said he wasn't going to run the marathon himself but joked he thought it would be a good idea to train his nephew up as he chatted with Jane Fishwick, 59, from Shrewsbury, Wiltshire.

After they met inside the England dressing room, Jane said: 'I suggested he might like to run one and he said there's a little bit of a problem there because he and William and Kate would all come under fire to do it if one of them does it.

'So then I suggested maybe they might like to train George up in good time and maybe they might like to hand the mantle on and he said he thought that might be a good idea.

'He said they could push him round.'

Jane is running in the marathon to raise money for Rugby Union's Injured Players Foundation which helped her family after her son Jack, 27, who was paralysed from the waist down in a devastating accident playing rugby for Wimbledon.

Jane said: 'I wanted to give something back for all they've done for us.

'They are a charity who are with you lifelong and we will benefit from their support forever. That's quite something.

'These types of injuries are rare but when it happens its catastrophic.' 

Jack said: 'Harry was asking about how I became injured. The IPF have helped me and my family in a million ways.'

Prince Harry, 30, arrived at the stadium at 1pm dressed casually in blue chinos and a pale green jacket. 

In what was his first engagement of the year, he watched around 60 runners train for the marathon out of the 150 who are running for his, Kate and William's charities - five each from around 30 charities. 

The organisations support each other through the Charities Forum which has regular meetings.

Harry was hosted by Dr Mike England, Director of the Injured Players Foundation and its Chairman John Owen as he watched runners put through their paces in the stadium.

Mike England said: 'This is to give the runners that final boost before the big day. 

'To have that support from Prince Harry is priceless.

'Whenever he interacts with us and with the clients he's always extremely relaxed and so natural. 

'That ability to interact with anybody. 

'He's given up his Sunday to come down here to say thank you personally to the runners, that's a wonderful thing to be able to do.'

Also at the event was Prince William's former flying instructor Wing Commander Kevin Marsh who helped William get his wings in 2008. 

He said about William now training to become an air ambulance pilot: 'I think it's fantastic. 

'He's a natural pilot and he's very good so it's absolutely right and proper.' 

He added: 'It's a lot of study, it's 14 exams on the ground let alone in the air.'
