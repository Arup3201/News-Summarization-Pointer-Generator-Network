Xavi Hernandez could yet remain at Barcelona until at least January after reportedly holding last-ditch talks with manager Luis Enrique and president Josep Maria Bartomeu.

It had been widely expected that the legendary midfield player would leave the Catalan side this summer and end his playing days with New York City in the MLS.

One possibility had been that Xavi would play for Manchester City’s other sister side, Melbourne City, in the A-League before the beginning of the new MLS season in March.

However, reports in Catalonia now say that Xavi has decided to stay at the Nou Camp after holding lengthy talks with Enrique and he will spend at least the first half of the season with the club. He is expected to report for training with Barcelona on Thursday.

It is understood that the 34-year-old Spaniard, who has won 22 trophies in a glittering career with Barcelona, could still join New York City in time for the club’s first campaign in the MLS in 2015.

If that move materialises, he will link up in the United States with Frank Lampard, whose move to New York City is likely to be finalised in the coming week.

Imminent: Frank Lampard's move to New York City is expected to be confirmed soon

Lampard is expected to spend the next few months in Australia with Melbourne, where he is likely to become what is known as the ‘marquee’ player.

Under strict regulations, Aussie clubs are allowed two marquee players, one of which must be Australian and the other can be from abroad, who are allowed a wage package that goes beyond the normal salary cap.

David Villa, who is spending a short stint in Melbourne before heading Stateside, is exempt from the marquee category as he is a ‘guest’ player that will qualify to play 10 non-consecutive games for the club.

This means that Lampard and Villa could both play for Melbourne until January, along with former Chelsea and Fulham midifelder Damien Duff, whose wage is below the club’s $2.55m salary cap.

However, Melbourne officials will have to decide between the commercial benefits that the presence of both Villa and Lampard will bring to the club and their chance of winning the league, for it will not be beneficial to lose the two star players in January midway through the season.

Ideally, Melbourne would prefer an international marquee player, therefore, that would remain at the club for the whole season but with the global standing of Villa and Lampard, they are likely to make an exception for this campaign.
