A Texas man landed in jail after trying to pull a prank on tax collectors involving a stack of tightly folded dollar bills.

Timothy Norris, 27, from Wichita Falls, was arrested January 28 after refusing to leave the county tax office while attempting to pay his property tax using several hundred extremely creased banknotes.

An arrest affidavit indicates the smart-aleck debtor was asked by tax collector Tommy Smyth to leave the Wichita County building for disrupting the operations of the office.

Tightfisted: Timothy Norris, 27, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest after he brought 600 tightly folded $1 banknotes to pay his property tax bill

Norris was attempting to pay his $600 tax bill using $1 bills folded so tightly it took personnel about six minutes to unfold each banknote, according to the affidavit obtained by Times Record News. 

The document states the situation turned physical when Norris pulled away twice from a deputy who was attempting to place him in handcuffs.
