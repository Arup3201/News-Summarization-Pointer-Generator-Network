A high-profile civil rights lawyer and ally of Al Sharpton has been told he will not face criminal charges after a woman accused him of rape last year.

A 42-year-old executive from the National Action Network claimed Sanford Rubenstein attacked her in his New York penthouse apartment following Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party in October.

The woman said she was drugged with cookies laced with marijuana before she was raped.

But the Manhattan district attorney's office have said Rubenstein's case will not be sent to the Grand Jury following a three-month investigation because of a lack of compelling evidence. 

The 70-year-old was set to represent the family of Eric Garner after he died in a chokehold at the hands of police officers in Staten Island in July. However he removed himself from the case when the allegations surfaced.

Rubenstein told the New York Daily News he was 'very pleased' with the decision and excited to get back to work.

In a statement he said: 'I maintained from the very beginning that I did not violate the law. I am pleased that the system worked and that I have now been fully cleared.' 

'I look forward to many more years of practicing law and representing victims.'

Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, released a statement Monday saying: 'Over the past three months, the District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit has conducted a thorough investigation into the incident that occurred on October 2 and was reported to authorities approximately 36 hours later. 

'In keeping with standard procedure, prosecutors and investigators with decades of experience in such matters reviewed all aspects of the incident, including video surveillance, physical evidence, and medical records, and conducted extensive witness and expert interviews.

'The video evidence in this case included surveillance footage from before and after the incident, taken from the lobby and elevator of the suspect's apartment building, as well as from earlier in the evening at the Four Seasons restaurant. 

'The investigation also included the collection and testing of multiple items of physical evidence, many pursuant to a search warrant executed at the suspect's apartment, as well as electronic devices and telephone records.

'A review of medical records was conducted by an independent medical expert. Experts at the National Institutes of Health and the FBI were also consulted. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner conducted toxicology and forensic testing, and further testing was performed at a second independent laboratory.

Allegations: Rubenstein maintained the encounter following Sharpton's 60th birthday was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams

'In all, 48 individuals were interviewed over the course of the investigation, including the complainant, the suspect, the complainant's friend who accompanied her to the suspect's apartment, Four Seasons employees, employees of the building where the incident occurred, drivers, and event guests.

'Given the available evidence, the degree of the complainant's recollection of what occurred at the suspect's apartment and the results of toxicological testing, neither the provable facts nor the applicable law support a prosecution in this matter.'

Ben Brafman, attorney for Sanford Rubenstein, said: 'Today I was informed that after a very thorough investigation, the District Attorney of New York County has decided that there would be no criminal charges filed against Mr Rubenstein in connection with a claim of Rape, which Mr Rubenstein has always vigorously denied. 

'Mr Rubenstein has maintained from the very outset that the woman in question was not drunk, she was not drugged, and she was not raped. Rape is undoubtedly a serious offense. To 'falsely' accuse someone of rape is however equally offensive.

'We are obviously pleased that this investigation is over and this outrageous lie has been put to rest.'

After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7 million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'. 

Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy.

Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. 

Investigation: NYPD officers were seen taking 'biological evidence' away from Rubenstein's luxury penthouse in brown bags after the allegations surfaced last November. They included a mattress, bedding and a sex toy
