Earl of Cardigan, pictured leaving court yesterday, is currently claiming benefits but has looked for work as a lorry driver, according to his mother

His privileged background provides him with a title, a stately home and a 4,000-acre country estate.

Yet it appears the Earl of Cardigan is also entitled – courtesy of the taxpayer – to around £71 per week in Jobseeker’s Allowance.

The aristocrat was revealed to be receiving the state benefit at his latest court appearance over a long-running feud with estate trustees.

The 60-year-old earl, full name David Michael James Brudenell-Bruce, had been due to stand trial after denying damaging six pheasant feeders worth £66 and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit worth £80.

The offences were said to have happened at his Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, which has been in his family for almost 1,000 years.

The troubled aristocrat claims to live there with rain coming in through the roof, no hot water, unsafe electrics and with heating confined to a single room after falling out with trustees in 2007 resulting in a reduced income.

The Old Etonian claims he must visit the public baths in Marlborough to take a hot shower and goes to bed fully clothed wearing a hat to keep warm.

The descendant of the man who led the Charge of the Light Brigade, the earl is at loggerheads with the trustees of his country pile.

He took one of them, his former friend John Moore, to the High Court accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission, but lost the case.

Their continued dispute, said to date back to 2007, has left him broke, he says.

Yesterday at Swindon Crown Court he was bound over in the sum of £200 to keep the peace – meaning the prosecution will probably drop all charges if he causes no trouble for a year.

The Earl of Cardigan lost a legal battle this month with his trustees over the sale of ancestral portraits

Old Etonian David Brudenell-Bruce is 
descendant of the 7th Earl who famously led the disastrous British 
cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the Russians in the Crimean 
War.

Their title goes back 
to 1611 when James I created the Baronetage of England and offered 
titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of Ireland.

They have lived on the same estate in Wiltshire for 1,000 years.

They rode 'into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell', wrote Tennyson in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack.

An
 appalling series of misunderstandings led to the Brigade advancing down
 a different valley from the one commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, had 
intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for Lord Lucan, the cavalry 
commander.

Despite the 
fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the Russian 
artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted 
laws of military practice - an incredulous Lucan passed the instructions
 on to the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade, and the 
troops advanced.

664 men took part and 110 were left dead.

Claire Marlow, prosecuting, said: 
‘These offences are generally of a nuisance and aimed at disrupting the 
workings of the trustees and the estate.’

Mike Pulsford, defending, said the 
earl was maintaining his innocence but agreed to be bound over, adding: 
‘There is a Chancery Court application by my client to remove the two 
trustees from the Savernake Estate.’

Mr Pulsford told the court that the earl is unemployed and has been receiving Jobseeker’s Allowance.

‘He is not working. One of his claims against the trustees is that they have withheld certain monies from him,’ he said.

Last week, the earl, whose daughter 
Catherine is pop singer Bo Bruce, was acquitted by magistrates of 
assaulting Mr Moore and criminal damage.

Outside court yesterday, the earl, 
who was accompanied by his second wife, Joanne, and her mother, said 
this case was the 14th set of allegations made against him during his 
long-running dispute.

‘Most of them have been dismissed by the police as
 being too absurd.

‘The battery I am accused of stealing is still sitting at the bottom of my garden, exactly where it was when this case started.

‘This is the most stupid of many stupid charges the police and Crown Prosecution Service have brought against me.

'What would I want with a used car battery that doesn’t even fit in my car?

'The gamekeeper had removed all the good pheasant feeders and left only the broken ones.

'Those are the ones I was accused of breaking further.’

The earl said the proceedings in the Chancery Court were about removing Mr Moore, a barrister’s clerk, as a trustee.

‘I will not rest until I have removed him from his position. Even if it takes me the rest of my life, that man will go.’

Bitter row: Lord Cardigan was friends with estate trustee John Moore (right) but their relationship has descended into a series of legal disputes
