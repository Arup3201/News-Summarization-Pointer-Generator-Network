Derek Jeter added one last hit onto his remarkable career, then waved his helmet in a final farewell to the Major Leagues. 

To honor his remarkable 20-year career, the city lit the Empire State Building up with pinstripes to mimic the Yankees jersey. 

Successful to the very end, the New York Yankees captain hit a high chop in the third inning that bounced off the right hand of leaping Red Sox third baseman Garin Cecchini. 

The 40-year-old reached first without drawing a throw, then, after a few seconds Brian McCann trotted from the dugout to replace him as a pinch runner. 

As he slowly ran off the field to complete his 20th big league season, he received a standing ovation, pointed to the Boston dugout and embraced pitcher Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz.

Fans, many of whom support the Yankees' biggest rival,  took out their phones to take pictures of the captain as he made his way back to the dugout after the first innings

The last active member of the Core Four that included Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte, Jeter led the Yankees to 13 AL East titles, seven AL pennants and five World Series championships. 

He broke an ankle in the 2012 AL championship series opener and was limited to 17 games the following season. He dropped off this year to a .256 average with four homers and 50 RBIs.

Before the game, Jeter was congratulated by former captains of local pro teams. During a half-hour ceremony, Carl Yastrzemski and Jason Varitek of the Red Sox, Bobby Orr of the Bruins, Troy Brown of the New England Patriots and Paul Pierce of the Celtics came out of the Boston dugout, one after the other.

They shook hands with Jeter, standing on the grass just behind the dirt at shortstop.

The 14-time All-Star returned to the lineup as designated hitter on Saturday and went 1 for 2. He his record with a hit during today's game 

At the start of the ceremony, the date 'SEPTEMBER 28 2014' was removed, one character at a time, from the hand-operated scoreboard on the left-field wall and replaced by 'WITH RESPECT 2 DEREK JETER.' Then the 'S' in 'RESPECT' was replaced by the No. 2.

Boston second baseman Dustin Pedroia presented a base with a No. 2 and blue pinstripes on it to Jeter. He also received a green sign with white characters like those on the Green Monster scoreboard saying 'RE2PECT.'

A video was shown of Jeter being doused in the Yankees clubhouse as part of the 'Ice Bucket Challenge' inspired by former Boston College baseball captain Pete Frates to raise awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. or Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition Frates is afflicted with. Then Frates rode onto the infield grass in his wheelchair and Jeter came in to greet him.

As he ran out onto the field, he kept raising his hat to the crowd ahead of the last game of the regular season

Before the game he was presented with a sign from Red Sox players David Ortiz and Xander Bogaerts. It was part of a four-hour ceremony that saw members of local pro teams come out and congratulate him 

Michelle Brooks Thompson, a Massachusetts native from the Voice TV show, sang 'Respect' on the infield dirt then Jeter shook hands and hugged her.

Jeter sat out Friday's series opener to recover from his emotionally draining final home game when his single in the ninth inning gave the Yankees a 6-5 win over the Baltimore Orioles and unleashed a wild celebration as teammates poured from the dugout to embrace him between first and second base.

The 14-time All-Star returned to the lineup as designated hitter on Saturday and went 1 for 2.

'The hard thing for me about this game is the relationships and how you get used to seeing people every day,' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said, 'and how abruptly it ends.

'Since (he was) a young man signing, really a teenager, it's really what he's known. It's what we've known him to be, the Yankees' shortstop, and it's hard to believe that it's coming to an end.'

Before the game, Boston manager John Farrell praised Jeter for 'a grace and a dignity, an integrity that probably is unmatched by others.'

Girardi had expected Jeter to receive a warm reception in enemy territory.

'Boston understands what Derek has meant to the Yankees playing him all these times,' Girardi said. 'I think it will be done right.'

Jeter was cheered when he took batting practice and when he ran into his dugout when it was over.
