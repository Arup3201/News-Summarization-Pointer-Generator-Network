Nurses who can’t speak English are being allowed to work on wards without undergoing proper tests, MPs warn today.

They accuse the nursing watchdog of endangering patients by failing to enforce adequate language checks and have asked for ‘urgent’ action on the problem.

There is widespread concern that many foreign nurses have a poor grasp of English and some patients report having to communicate by sign language.

Under EU rules the Nursing and Midwifery Council is forbidden from testing European nurses before allowing them on the register. However, the watchdog can instruct hospitals and care homes to carry out their own checks on skills and language before employing nurses.

But MPs from the Health Select Committee warn that the NMC is not doing enough to enforce these tests.

In a report today, they accuse the watchdog of failing to put in place ‘sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of patients’.

The flaws of not checking doctors for their skills or language ability was exposed by the case of incompetent GP Daniel Ubani who killed pensioner David Gray in 2008

One of Britain’s top doctors, Lord Winston, has expressed particular concern over nurses coming in from Eastern Europe. The peer, a world-renowned fertility specialist, said they had been trained in a ‘completely different way’ to British nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or their own patients.

His views were backed up by Lord Kakkar, a surgeon, who said the situation was ‘intolerable’.

Some patients claim they have mistakenly been given food by nurses who do not understand ‘nil by mouth’ while others have resorted to using sign language.

Rules from Brussels state that neither the NMC, nor the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, can test foreign workers before allowing them to register.

But the flaw was tragically exposed in 2008 when pensioner David Gray was killed by an incompetent German GP, Daniel Ubani. The doctor had been allowed to cover an out-of-hours shift in Cambridgeshire without facing any checks on his medical skills or English language.

The GMC has taken steps to get round the EU rules by ensuring checks are carried out by hospitals and primary care organisations.

The watchdog has told all NHS trusts to appoint a senior medic tasked with checking foreign doctors’ competence and language.

MPs today urged the nursing watchdog to take similar measures to reduce ‘risk to patients’.

Every year around 3,000 nurses from the EU register with the NMC. It is not known how many are made to take tests before they are employed.

But last year an investigation by the Mail found that nine in ten hospitals did not bother carrying out checks on nurses’ language or competence.

Many assumed they had already sat tests for the NMC – not realising these are banned by the EU. Nurses coming to work in England from elsewhere in the world have to undergo rigorous English exams.
