American Airlines has blamed improperly installed clamps for rows of seats coming loose mid-flight, forcing two planes to make emergency landings.

Seats have come loose on three separate flights in the past week sparking a federal investigation into the airline, America’s third biggest carrier.

Seats on 36 of the airline's Boeing 757 planes were inspected and fixed with another 11 are still to be checked, the carrier said.

The airline, whose parent AMR Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in November, said that they have been working with federal safety administrations to make sure that all of their planes are up to par.

American Airline vice president of safety David L. Campbell said that the clamps may have been installed incorrectly during maintenance work by American crews and outside contractor Timco Aviation Services.

The problems began on Saturday when a 
Miami-bound flight took off from Boston and a row of seats became 
unhinged. They slid around the cabin, forcing the plane to make an 
emergency landing at New York City's JFK Airport.

A second plane was discovered to have loose seats on Monday after taking off for Miami and was forced to return to JFK.

Flight 443 left Kennedy at 7.11 am and 
returned to the gate around an hour later. After a delay of two hours, 
passengers continued on their journey.

Another plane flying from Boston to Miami on Saturday diverted to New York after seats loosened in mid-flight.

Spencer Nam, a stock analyst from Boston who was on the flight, said the flight was delayed after boarding passengers noticed that the seats in one row were leaning against another.

He said: ‘When it comes to flying, I don't like unexpected events.

‘I'm 42, I've been flying more than 20 years, and I've never seen where seats weren't screwed down.’

The debacles came as reports of smoke in a plane cabin forced an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London to be diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland on Tuesday. The airline blamed a faulty fan in an entertainment system for the smoke.

The combination of the safety issues has raised questions about the safety of the airline with aviation industry experts claiming that bad publicity could lead passengers to avoid the carrier.

Matt Ziemkiewicz, president of the safety-advocacy group National Air Disaster Alliance, said passengers could be hurt or killed in an otherwise survivable crash if seats break loose from their moorings.

He said: ‘What if it's a little kid or an old person in the row behind them?

‘That seat becomes a projectile with people on it.’

The planes in the Saturday and Monday incidents were serviced in the last two months, with the seats removed and reinstalled, American Airlines said.

Up to par: The airline's parent AMR Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in November and is now working with federal safety administrations to make sure all their planes are up to par

Mr Campbell said new seats on some of the airline’s 757s had different fastening systems that required precise positioning of the seats so they could lock into place. The new system holds seats in place using two bolts at the back that are tightened with wrenches and two in front that are tightened by hand. Previously, the four bolts were all wrench-tightened.

He said: ‘It's a very temperamental job.’

The work was done at the airline’s base in Tulsa, Oklahoma and a Timco facility in North Carolina.

Airline spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said in both cases the airline’s employees were the last to touch the seats, a comment which drew a fierce response from the Transport Workers Union which represents the airline’s maintenance employees.

Union official John Hewitt said: ‘Our workers were the last to touch the seats only in the sense that after the seats came loose we were dispatched (to fix them).’

The union blamed Timco and criticised management at the airline’s parent company AMR Corp for cutting costs by outsourcing maintenance work.

A Timco spokesman said the company is investigating the incidents.

American Airline and government officials say the safety issues were not related to other difficulties with union workers who are unhappy about pending layoffs and cuts to pay and benefits as it tries to turn around under bankruptcy protection.

The delays and cancellations have 
annoyed passengers, but even the hint of mechanical issues could 
frighten them away and even threaten American's existence, experts said.

Robert Mann, an aviation consultant who once worked at American, said delays, cancellations and bad publicity about broken seats could create an opening for rivals United Airlines and Delta Air Lines to poach American customers in competitive markets like Chicago and New York.

He said: ‘I'm struck by how close this company is to losing its way.’

George Hobica, founder of travel website airfarewatchdog.com said: 'These things can kill an airline.

'With a delay or cancellation, you're sitting on the ground. (With loose seats) if the plane hits turbulence, people go flying.'
