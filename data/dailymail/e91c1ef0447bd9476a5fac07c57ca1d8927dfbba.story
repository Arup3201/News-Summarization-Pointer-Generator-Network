Jennifer, 28, was a electrical engineering graduate and Josephine, 23, was an accountancy manager for the family business.

Following the air tragedy, which saw the passenger plane 
crash into a residential area, Nigeria announced a three-day period of state mourning.

The
pilot of the ill-fated plane had sent out emergency signals while 
nearing the runway, indicating a technical problem.

The Boeing MD-83 
plane, belonging to Dana Air, an Indian-owned company, went down near 
the airport shortly afterwards.

Authorities believe many people on
the ground may have been killed besides all 153 passengers and crew on board.

A statement from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said he 'prays that God 
Almighty will grant the families of the victims of the plane crash the 
courage and fortitude to bear their irreparable loss'.

The aircraft appeared to have landed 
on its belly into the dense neighborhood that sits along the approach path taken by aircraft heading into Lagos' Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport.

The plane tore through roofs, sheared a
mango tree and rammed into a woodworking studio, a printing press and 
at least two large apartment buildings in the neighborhood before 
stopping.

A white, noxious cloud rose from the 
crash site that burned onlookers' eyes, as pieces of the plane lay 
scattered around the muddy ground.

Distressing: Smoke pours from the wreckage of the plane after it crashed into the building, killing at least 140

The flight disappeared from radar 
screens on Sunday one minute after declaring the emergency at 3.43pm 
local time an aviation ministry statement said.

At the crash site in Lagos' Iju-Ishaga neighborhood, about five miles from Lagos airport, local residents carried 
fire hoses, trying an extinguish the plane's burning fuselage.

The major challenges of life in oil-rich 
Nigeria quickly became apparent as there wasn't any water to put out the
flames more than three hours later.

This morning the difficulties continued as a torrential downpour and strong winds prevented emergency crews from returning to the devastated neighborhood where the airliner crashed.

Dana, which began operating in 2008, issued a statement following the crash specifying that the plane was carrying 146 passengers and seven crew.

The airline's website said today that all flights had been suspended.

Dana Air have also announced the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is leading the crash investigation with help from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

Harold Demuren, the director-general of the 
Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, said today the pilot of the downed aircraft was an American and the 
co-pilot was Indian.

Chinese officials have said six of its nationals were on the plane and France said that one of its nationals, a woman, was on the flight.
