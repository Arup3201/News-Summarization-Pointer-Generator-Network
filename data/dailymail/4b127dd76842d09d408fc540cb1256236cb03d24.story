A kitten found in sub-zero weather in Denver is perky and purring after workers at an animal shelter used heating pads, blankets and hair dryers to save its life.

The approximately 3-month-old 1.2 pound kitten was found tangled in some electric wires on a porch Thursday and brought to the Denver Dumb Friends League.

Shelter spokeswoman Megan Rees says the orange tabby was barely breathing and her temperature was so low it didn't register on a thermometer.

'You could sort of feel the cold coming off her,' said the veterinarian, Dr. Kasey Carter, who treated the kitten.

Workers also used hot water bottles, booties and a blanket that fluffs up with warm air to heat up the cat.

After an hour and a half, she began to perk up and start eating.

The staff named her Elsa after the character in the Disney movie Frozen. She'll be put up for adoption if no one claims her.

'When she came into the shelter, we weren't even sure if she was alive,' said Megan Rees, a spokeswoman for the shelter told ABC.

Rees said the kitten had been suffering in temperatures below 10 degrees Fahrenheit for a few hours and it's a miracle she;s alive.

Elsa is in stable condition and will either be claimed by her owner or put up for adoption.

Rees said that the likelihood of small kittens like Elsa surviving in such harsh conditions is low and that Elsa was very brave during her recovery.

'They're so small and fragile to begin with,' said Rees.

'It's hard to imagine a kitten surviving in such severely cold weather for an extended period of time. ... It's just really a miracle that she was able to pull through.'

New home: Elsa will be put up for adoption if her owner doesn't claim her from the animal shelter 

Finest treatment: Elsa the cat was given immediate care at the animal shelter the nursed her to heath
