A popular high school basketball coach believes he lost his job after a disgruntled and vengeful parent emailed a controversial film he acted in ten years ago to the school principal.

Mike Hvizdo, who worked at Weston High School in Connecticut, was asked to resign on February 6 after administrators saw a short film called Forbidden Fruit that he acted in back in 2003.

The nine-minute black and white comedy video contains vulgar language and raunchy themes but no pornography, nudity or illegal material.

School officials said the film was 'offensive' and compromised Hvizdo's position as coach of the Trojans basketball team.

In the three weeks since Hvizdo left his job, he has received huge support from the Weston community and the vast majority of parents.

Successful: Mike Hvizdo (right), popular basketball coach at Weston High School, was forced to leave his job after a controversial video from ten years ago resurfaced

The Weston Forum reported that a 'general consensus among the school basketball community was that a parent brought the issue to the school’s attention.'

And The Hour claimed that a parent 'upset with the way their son was being treated as a WHS basketball player' sent the video to Weston High principal, Lisa Wolak. The paper added that the 'inquiry into Hvizdo's past was nothing more than a blatant attack with the sole goal of getting the coach removed.'

It is reported that Hvizdo met with school officials and was forced to resign, citing 'personal reasons.'

Weston High then sent a letter to parents which stated: 'This film is vulgar, contains offensive sexual language, and depicts sexual acts among multiple partners in which Mr. Hvizdo is a participant.'

'Unfortunately, material posted on the Internet takes on a life of its own, and there is no way to guarantee that this video will not be viewed by our entire community and most importantly, by our student athletes, now and into the future,' it continued.

Dedicated: Most parents at the school have said that Hizdo is a good role model

Hvizdo disagrees, telling ABC
 'It may not be the type of film everyone likes to watch but nothing 
illegal, pornographic whatsoever, and no nudity … and I was an actor.'

The coach said that his job is 'not just about teaching these kids basketball. It’s about teaching them life lessons.'

'I don’t make a lot of money,' he explained to ABC. 'I do it because I love it. They’re my sons, 30 sons.'

The
 film was produced and written by Steve 
Moremarco who was an assistant to Jack Black and has gone on to work on 
TV shows like Everybody Hates Chris and ER, and the film School Of Rock.

Moremarco has explained his side of the story on his blog, Moremarkable, stating: 'Mike Hvizdo did NOTHING WRONG. I did NOTHING WRONG.

'This
 was a movie for adults, by adults, created by artists working in their 
craft. If the movie that Mike was in was The Hangover Part 2 – would 
there be any outcry?! Would the filmmaker be called and asked to keep 
the film private?' 
Moremarco asked.

Weston 
High parents have rallied round Hvizdo - over 100 people turned up at a 
education board meeting last Monday in support of the coach.

Jonathan Bombart, who has a son on the team, told the Weston Forum
 that Hvizdo was hugely dedicated to his work. 'He was really good for 
the kids,' said Mr. Bombart. 'He taught them great life lessons. The 
kids loved him.'

'I don¿t make a lot of money,' Hvizdo said of his coaching job. 'I do it because I love it. They¿re my sons, 30 sons.'

Kay Spencer, a parent of a student at Weston High School, told ABC that Hvizdo was an excellent influence on the teenagers.

'Coach
 Hvizdo’s been very involved with all of the kids in the community. We 
definitely believe that he is a good role model and a good person,' she 
said.

Weston resident 
Philip Hover told The Hour he was looking forward to his son joining 
Hvizdo's team next year: 'I'd be honored to have Mike Hvizdo coach my 
son,' Hover said.

'(The
 movie) has absolutely nothing to do with teaching kids to play 
basketball. I would be happy to have him coach here. This is a 
miscarriage of justice. No one in this room can say they haven't uttered
 a vulgarity. Coach Viz should be re-instated. Let he who is without sin
 cast the first stone.'

'This
 is the worst case of (Hvizdo) being bullied,' actor Joe Pantoliano told
 the board. 'This is such a wonderful opportunity for this community to 
teach that we make mistakes. Re-instate Mike.'

The school district now says it is 'continuing its review of the matter.'
