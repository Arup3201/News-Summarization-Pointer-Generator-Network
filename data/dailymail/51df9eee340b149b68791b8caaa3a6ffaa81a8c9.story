An aide to the Republican candidate running against Newark, NJ, Mayor Cory Booker for the state’s vacant Senate seat has been fired after a profane rant questioning his rival’s sexuality.

Stephen Lonegan aide Rick Shaftan was fired after an explicit tirade to Talking Points Memo about Mr Booker’s unwillingness to ‘take advantage of the perks of office’ during interaction the Newark mayor had with a vegan stripped from Oregon, concluding he tweets like ‘a gay guy.’

Published Friday, the rant came after Mr Shaftan was asked why he felt Mr Lonegan was gaining in the polls against his more well-known rival. The misguided attack also saw the strategist compare Mr Booker to disgraced former senators Larry Craig and Gary Hart.

Misguided: Republican operative Rick Shaftan's rant against Newark Mayor Cory Booker cost him his job

Mr Shaftan’s first shots at the mayor were directed at his Twitter exchange last month with the stripper.

It was just weird. I mean, to me, you know, hey, if he said, 'Hey, you got really hot breasts man, I'd love to suck on them.' Then like, yeah, cool. But like, he didn't say that,’ Mr Shaftan explained to TPM.

‘It was like kind of like, I don't know, it was like what a gay guy would say to a stripper,’ Mr Shaftan continued. ‘It's the way he was talking to her. It's just like like there was no sexual interest at all.’

The Lonegan aide then bragged that if he was single and a stripped was tweeting him, that he ‘might take advantage of the perks of the office.’

They've even met!: Mr Shaftan posted this picture, taken with Newark Mayor Cory Booker, to his Facebook page

Mr Booker met stripper Lynsie Lee while filming a still-unreleased documentary about Twitter, according to TPM.

The Twitter exchange between the two, which BuzzFeed made public last month, was brief and fairly innocuous.

‘And the East Coast loves you and by the East Coast, I mean me,’ Booker wrote.

‘Well now I'm blushing :),’ Ms Lee replied.

"Its only fair,’ Booker retorted.

The faux-controversy soon blew over. A Booker adviser even joked that the real story was that a vegan strip club exists.

The messages in question: This Twitter exchange gave mr Shaftan fits, leading him to say Mr Booker tweets like a 'gay man'

Big fan: Ms Lee's prolific appreciation of Mr Booker via Twitter shows up almost daily, she has even claimed to 'have dibs on First Lady'

The mayor himself touted the Twitter exchange as proof he is still ‘engaging with people no matter what their profession,’ TPM noted.

Remarking about the non-stop flood of naked pics posted to social media by the gregarious stripper, Mr Lonegan gnashed his teeth over Booker’s lack of interest.

‘I don't know who she is. I don't know anything about her.' Get the f**k out of here dude,’ Mr Shaftan ranted. ‘You can't follow her Twitter page and not know she's got those great breasts. How do you f*****g not know?’

‘Who does this guy really want to work for? Who's he representing?’ Mr Shaftan wondered aloud.

The unhinged aide also questioned the frontrunner’s willingness to allow speculation over his sexuality to continue, his fondness for pedicures and Hollywood fundraisers.

You're fired!: Stephen Lonegan immediately fired Mr Shaftan and apologized for his remarks

‘I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I’m gay, and I say, ‘So what does it matter if I am? So be it,’ Mr Booker said earlier this year. ‘I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I’m straight.’

The soon-to-be-fired aide’s rant began to finish up after he compared Mr Booker to former Senators Larry Craig and Gary Hart.

Mr Craig’s political career came to a screeching halt after he was busted in an airport sex sting trying to solicit sex in a men’s bathroom, infamously tapping his foot on the ground between stalls.

Mr Hart’s numerous affairs, most notably with Donna Rice, brought a disastrous end to his 1988 presidential candidacy.

No comment: Mr Booker has not publicly remarked on Mr Shaftan's comments

Finally satisfied he had exorcised all of the Booker demons from his system, Mr Shaftan touted his candidates ‘surging’ place in the polls.

Mr Lonegan fired him almost immediately after the article was published Friday afternoon, and publicly apologized for his comments.

Mr Booker has not publicly addressed the incendiary comments. Neither he, nor his campaign could be reached by MailOnline.

This is the second time in recent months a New York-area political aide's ranting has been highlighted on TPM. Anthony Weiner aide Barbara Morgan cursed an intern during a July rant to the site. Mr Weiner declined to fire her.

The special election to determine who will fill the NJ Senate seat left vacant after the death of Senator Frank Lautenberg died will be held Wednesday.
