Hazmat teams arrived at the apartment of Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer last night to remove items that he could have contaminated.

Workers from Bio Recovery Corp were at the property in Harlem, New York, wheeling away large blue barrels to be taken for testing at the CDC.  

The containers were loaded onto the back of the truck into the night as cleanup crews carried out essential testing of the apartment.

A Hazmat worker wheels a barrel out of Dr Craig Spencer's apartment so it can be transported to the Center for Disease Control 

The containers are loaded onto the back of a lorry by workers who had been in the Harlem apartment all day 

They contain possibly contaminated goods and are taken by the Bio Recovery Corp. team for testing 

According to their site, the company charged with the clean-up, is 'dedicated to the recovery of all accident, crime, trauma and bio-hazardous scenes; from suicides, homicides, hoarding clean up, sewage back flows, and microbial contamination issues.'

The same team also cleaned The Gutter Friday night, the Williamsburg bowling alley Spencer was at the night before he wad admitted. 

The NYPD began putting up barriers late on Friday morning to prepare for the decontamination, and cleaners arrived.

The biohazard truck was parked near the home with large blue sealed containers in the back. 

There has been no evacuation order for the building, and the Department of Health has been canvassing the neighborhood to keep neighbors informed. 

Some workers had been previously criticized for not wearing enough protective clothing  

The men were sent in to sterilize the apartment

They left without any gloves, face masks or protective gear

The men works for a company called Bio Recovery Corp.

They had been in the apartment almost all day working

The sealed barrels were then loaded into the back of a truck

It is uncertain where these barrels will now be disposed of

This comes just one day after NYC police officers were seen throwing gloves and tape into a public trash can near Spencer's apartment

These men had not been in the apartment building however

This comes just one day after police were seen throwing gloves, face masks and caution tape in a public trash can after being near Spencer's apartment.

Those men, however, were never in the apartment building, and it is standard practice for NYC police officers to wear gloves while putting up and taking down caution tape.
