Pakistan's prime minister was jailed for around three minutes yesterday after he was convicted of contempt in a bizarre court case.

The country's Supreme Court ruled Yousuf Raza Gilani would be sentenced 'until the rising of the court,' or until the judges left the chamber.

That happened about three minutes 
after the verdict was handed down, and then Gilani was released.

In a key session, the court also refused to reopen an old corruption case against the country's president Asif Ali Zardari, but spared him a prison term.

The case has stoked political tensions in the country and the ruling against Gilani appeared to be a compromise.

But the case could still mean problems for Gilani because he has been convicted in a court.

That means he could face dismissal from office in the weeks, or more likely, months to come.

His lawyer said he would appeal the verdict, further delaying any action that could see Gilani lose his job.

Gilani was found guilty for failing to write to the Swiss authorities to ask them to re-open graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari, who heads the Pakistan People's Party

The case against President Asif Ali Zardari, pictured here holding a picture of his late wife Benazir Bhutto, involves kickbacks he and Mrs Bhutto, a former prime minister, allegedly received from Swiss companies when she was in power in the 1990s

* Gilani was summoned before the Supreme Court on January 19 for failing to take steps to re-open money-laundering proceedings against President Asif Ali Zardari. He was indicted for contempt of court on February 13.

* The civilian-judicial confrontation stems from thousands of cases thrown out in 2007 under an amnesty ordered by former military president Pervez Musharraf, which paved the way for a return to civilian rule.

* Zardari was the decree's most prominent beneficiary. He became the main target of the court when it voided the measure in 2009 and ordered the government to ask Swiss authorities to restart legal action against him.

* The cases date back to the 1990s, when Zardari had multiple cases of corruption lodged against him, including accusations of money laundering using Swiss accounts. He says all the cases are false and politically motivated.

* Gilani and his advisers have defied the court, citing the president's constitutional immunity as head of state. The prime minister appealed the court's decision to charge him with contempt, but that appeal was dismissed in February.                  

Elections are scheduled for later this year or early next, meaning it is quite possible the government could see out its term with Gilani still in charge.

Gilani smiled when the verdict was read out in a packed court house.

Gilani is the longest-serving prime minister in the history of Pakistan, where civilian governments have repeatedly been toppled by the country's powerful military, often with the support of the Supreme Court, which critics allege is heavily politicized.

Corruption charges have routinely been used to target those in power, or seeking to return.

The source of the current conflict is a graft case against President Zardari that involves kickbacks he and his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, allegedly received from Swiss companies when Bhutto was in power in the 1990s.

They were found guilty in absentia in a Swiss court in 2003.

Zardari appealed, but Swiss prosecutors ended up dropping the case in 2008 after the Pakistani government approved an ordinance giving the president and others immunity from old corruption cases that many agreed were politically motivated.

The Pakistani Supreme Court ruled the ordinance unconstitutional in 2009 and ordered the government to write a letter to Swiss authorities requesting they reopen the case against Zardari. Gilani has refused, saying the Pakistani constitution grants the president immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.
