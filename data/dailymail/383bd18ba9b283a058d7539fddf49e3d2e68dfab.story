The husband of a pregnant mother-of-four, who has been missing since December 10, admitted that he did not tell police the complete truth.

Justin Adams, 25, failed to mention that he and his wife were 'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage therapist'.

Police said Jaymie Adams, 25, who has been missing from her home in Blanchard, Oklahoma, may have been murdered.

Suspicious disappearance: Police searching for a missing mother-of-four Jaymie Adams are now treating the case as a homicide investigation

Husband: Justin Adams, 25, changed his story and told police he and his wife had advertised on Craigslist as 'swingers'

Mr Adams was the last
person to see his wife alive after she left their trailer park home to meet a 'friend' at a 
McDonald's.

Her husband said she had called from the fast-food joint saying her 'friend' had not shown up - but that was the last he heard from her. He denied 
knowing who she was meeting.

The family's van was found at the restaurant. Police seized the vehicle to look for evidence.

Mr Adams was interrogated by police for five hours after her disappearance but was released without charge.

Search warrants
filed this week in Oklahoma County revealed that Mr Adams returned to the 
police station on December 11 to say that 'he hadn't been completely honest with 
officers in reference to his report'.

He then revealed that his wife went to meet a 'client' at a motel in Norman. 

Mr Adams said his wife advertised on Craigslist as a massage therapist and had been 'meeting with strangers'. He believed she may have been paid for sex.

Mr Adams also said that he and his wife were swingers who used Craigslist to meet with other couples who wanted to swap partners for sex.  

The search warrant also revealed that investigators discovered Mrs Adams' social security card and the couple's marriage licence in a bedroom drawer at their home. A red purse containing several sex toys was also recovered.

Oklahoma City police Sgt Jennifer Wardlow told MailOnline today there were no further updates in the Jaymie Adams case.

Police had named no suspects, no arrests had been made and it was still being treated as a missing person's case.

Sgt Wardlow added that detectives were following up every possible lead involved in the case. 

Oklahoma City police Capt Dexter Nelson said: 'Homicide will get involved, in cases like this, because of the length of time she's been missing. There's that, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding the disappearance.

'Since she left her home no one has been able to locate her or call her on her cell phone.'

Justin and Jaymie Adams have been married since February and have a four-month-old baby.

In the days after she went missing, Mr Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely.

He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother.

'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife, we have three sons and she's 2-month pregnant this week.

'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call OKCPD.'

Hunt: Police have been searching for the 25-year-old since December 10 and friends and family have handed out these flyers to help find her

A Facebook page has been set up to try and find the missing mother.

Blake Parsons, the father of one of Jaymie's children, told NewsOK he is not surprised she was involved in prostitution.

He described her as a loose cannon and said he would often wake up in the middle of the night to find her gone from the bed.

He said: 'Some of us who knew her, when we heard this, we weren't surprised. I don't want anything bad to happen to Jaymie, and I hope they find her alive and healthy.

'But we just think this was her past catching up with her.'
