The boss of the events company that organised a bar crawl during which a teenager was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men has said he will not apologise to the woman's family.

Paul Smith, from London, head of Carnage Events Magalluf, defended his pub crawls saying that he had no 'moral responsibility' for the British woman's actions - and said she should be spoken to by her parents.

Smith held a press conference at one of his bars in Magaluf today - blaming the Northern Irish teenager's actions on her 'upbringing'.

He said of the video, which was posted on YouTube and went viral last week: 'I was disgusted by it. Disgusted by the young lady who was doing it.

'I can't say that my reps encouraged that as that's not what happened.

'She should be spoken to by her parents. It's something to do with her upbringing.

Asked whether he felt any responsibility, Smith told 5 News: 'I've no moral responsibility for this – I wasn’t even fully aware of it at the time.

'The
 girl involved even bought a ticket for the following night’s Carnage 
tour. Carnage didn’t encourage her, so why should I apologise?

'We’re giving memories of Magaluf, that’s all.'

Sitting with his lawyer, Mateo Canes, Smith continued: 'It was wrong for it 
to have happened – I made a mistake, but I’m only human and I work hard 
for what I’ve got.

'So we’ll be taking action so nothing like 
this happens again. There’ll be more security… that sort of thing. I 
don’t want to lose my licence, so there will definitely be changes.

'And there needs to be more control of Magaluf.'

Smith's comments comes as a new law was passed cracking down on bar crawls in the Spanish party town.

New legislation unveiled today limits to 50 the number of holidaymakers permitted on bar crawls in the popular resort of Magaluf.

The mayor of Calvia, the region which includes Magaluf and five other resorts popular with Britons, said today he had passed a law 'giving us tighter control over the operation of pub crawl organisers'.

Carnage Magalluf was set up two years ago.

The entertainment and events company runs boat parties, ‘celebrity’ pool parties (featuring reality TV stars from shows such as The Only Way Is Essex) and bar crawls.

The infamous 'Carnage' bar crawls are run three times a week along Punta Ballena - the main strip through Magaluf.

On average, there are 200 British youngsters on these bar crawls, including many who have just finished their A-levels.

They pay around £25 a head to join the bar crawl — meaning Carnage takes about £5,000 a night, and £15,000 a week.

Those taking part are provided with 'Carnage' branded t-shirts which are emblazoned with slogans such as ‘Snog A Passer-by’ and ‘Have A Lapdance’.

Carnage Magalluf, which was set up by two brothers from London, is not linked to Carnage UK - the company behind notorious student party nights in Britain.

Manuel Onieva also said a police 
investigation had started into last week's incident, adding that he 
wished to 'express my total rejection and anger at the activities which 
were carried out in a video which is currently on the social media 
circuit'.

He added: 'Companies operating pub crawls in Calvia now have to apply for a licence through the town hall.

'They have to prove their responsibility and show that they have the appropriate civil insurances in place.

'Each pub crawl guide will have to wear a specific jacket so local police can monitor those operating in the region and identify those that have been approved. 'Pub crawl groups can now not exceed more than 50 people and if any operators exceed this legal capacity, they will be fined.'

The pub crawl was organised Carnage 
Magalluf which describes itself on its website as the 'leader in 
Magalluf party entertainment [sic]'.

The company advertises a three-event package for £79.99 including 'barcrawl, boat party and jungle sessions'.

The
 bar crawl is a four-nights-a-week event which includes 'four hours of 
unlimited drinking, four hours of unlimited free shots and a free 
Carnage vest/T-shirt'.

It has been reported that the Magaluf pub crawls have around 200 British youngsters on them, including many who have just finished their A-levels.

The Calvia region, which also includes the resort of Palma Nova, is visited by between 1.6 million and 2 million visitors a year, of whom around one million are Britons.

British visits to the region are worth an estimated £640m a year to the local economy.

Danny Daly (above) is believed to have set up Carnage Events Magalluf with his brother John

Danny Daly and his brother John are believed to be the men behind the controversial Carnage Magalluf company.

The brothers, who are both married with young children, are thought to have set up the operation two years ago after moving to Majorca from the East End of London.

Despite living in Santa Ponsa, Majorca (about a ten-minute drive from Magaluf) for around 20 years, they decided to set up the events and entertainment company in 2012.

As well as Carnage Magalluf, they also have at least two bars in the resort: EastEnders and Magaluf Rocks. Needless to say, both are on the Carnage bar crawl itinerary.

They also own a lap-dancing club called Pure, where Danny Daly was spotted emerging recently, plus two of Magaluf’s biggest hotels, the TRH Torrenova and Palmanova, which means the Dalys have more than 3,000 guests a week.

By any reckoning, the brothers are among the most powerful figures in Magaluf.

The pair are said to make around £15,000 a week from the Carnage bar crawl alone and reportedly spend their winters at holiday homes in the Bahamas.

Despite Carnage Magalluf describing itself on its website as the ‘leader in Magaluf party entertainment’, in contrast, the Dalys are men who prefer to stay behind the scenes.

They never give interviews and the one and only picture of Danny Daly on Facebook — where he is wearing a branded Carnage t-shirt — has now been taken down.

Danny and John Daly’s right-hand man is believed to be Alan Collinson, 28. He is reportedly paid well enough to afford to rent a luxury villa, with a swimming pool, on the outskirts of Magaluf.

A tattooed kickboxer from Hartlepool, Collinson was investigated by Spanish police for allegedly attacking four members of a stag do — leaving two with broken jaws — on a Carnage crawl in May.
