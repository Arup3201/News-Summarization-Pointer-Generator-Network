The campaign for Scottish independence suffered a double blow today after two major businesses warned against the dangers of separation.

Scottish financial giant Standard Life revealed it was putting in place plans to move parts of its business to England to protect itself against independence.

It came as Britain’s biggest fuel company BP warned against voting ‘Yes’ next week. It released a statement saying the prospects for North Sea oil were best served by the UK.

Lib Dem cabinet minister Danny Alexander said the interventions had been Mr Salmond's 'Black Wednesday'.

First Minister Alex Salmond's campaign for a Yes vote suffered a blow after a number of companies came out against independence

Standard Life chief David Nish said his firm was preparing to move big chunks of his company to England in the event of a 'Yes' to independence vote

Mr Alexander said the Standard Life and BP statements had come after £2billion had been wiped off the value of a number of top Scottish firms – including RBS, Lloyds, Stagecoach and others – amid fears over independence.

He also pointed to remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who said a currency union was incompatible with being independent.

The giant bank Credit Suisse yesterday claimed a separate Scotland would face huge austerity, falling wages and would fall into a ‘deep recession’.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This is the day the economic case for separation died and reality that independence will cost jobs, investment, and growth dawned. Today is Alex Salmond's Black Wednesday.’

Standard Life boss David Nish released a statement to investors highlighting the ‘constitutional uncertainly’ in the 18 months after independence.

He said the company would ‘take whatever action is required to protect our customers' interests’ by moving huge chunks of its business south of the border.

Mr Nish said: ‘There continues to be uncertainty around a range of issues material to Scotland's future in the event of Scotland separating from the United Kingdom.’

He said these included ‘the currency that an independent Scotland would use’, whether Scotland would be in the EU and the ‘arrangements for financial services regulation’ in an independent Scotland

It was also unclear what tax would be levied on savings and pensions, he said.

BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley has backed claims that Alex Salmond is vastly overstating the amount of oil left in the North Sea

He added: ‘In view of the uncertainty around Scotland's constitutional future, we have put in place precautionary measures which would help enable us to provide customers with continuity.

‘This includes planning for new regulated companies in England to which we could transfer parts of our business if there was a need to do so.

‘This transfer of our business could potentially include pensions, investments and other long-term savings held by UK customers.’

He added: ‘Standard Life has a long history in Scotland – a heritage of which we are very proud – and we hope that this continues but our responsibility is to protect the interests of our customers, our shareholders, our people and other stakeholders in our business.’

BP’s intervention today meanwhile warned voters not to trust Alex Salmond’s estimates for North Sea oil.

The oil company’s boss Bob Dudley backed warnings by the oil industry’s most eminent businessman that Mr Salmond’s economic case for separation relies on highly inflated estimates for North Sea tax revenue.

Mr Dudley said Sir Ian Wood’s assessment that the North Sea would be all but spent by 2050 was correct and used Scots to vote No. His opposite number at Shell also backed the estimate.

Sir Ian Wood, who has been praised by both David Cameron and Mr Salmond as the industry's foremost figure, warned Scottish voters were using their hearts rather than their heads in weighing up the independence debate.

Mr Dudley said: ‘BP has been in the UK North Sea for 50 years and we hope to operate here for many years to come. However, the province is now mature and I believe Sir Ian Wood correctly assesses its future potential.

‘The opportunities today are smaller and more challenging to develop than in the past. We also face the challenges of extending the productive life of existing assets and managing the future costs of decommissioning.

‘Much of this activity requires fiscal support to be economic, and future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty.

‘Our business invests for decades into the future. It is important our plans are based on a realistic view of the North Sea’s future potential and the challenges the industry faces in continuing to operate here.

‘As a major investor in Scotland – now and into the future – BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom.’ 

Mr Cameron made an impassioned plea for the union during his visit to the Scottish Widows offices in Edinburgh today
