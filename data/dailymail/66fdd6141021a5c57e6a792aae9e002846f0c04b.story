Cristiano Ronaldo is 'almost perfect' and it'd come as a huge shock to Portugal if he didn't clinch the Ballon d'Or as the former Manchester United talisman gets ready for a return to the city where he made his name.

That's the bullish view of Ricardo Carvalho, who brushed off any suggestion that the Real Madrid man could be pipped to the award by Lionel Messi.

Ronaldo lines up against the Barcelona forward at Old Trafford on Tuesday ahead of a crowd which could hit 50,000.

'There is no reason why not,' said Carvalho when asked about Ronaldo's chances in the World Player of the Year competition. 'He's never stopped wanting to win, and there is no reason for him not to win it for a third time. 

'It's normal to speak about them [Messi and Ronaldo] but it's Portugal against Argentina'

'Everyone expects Ronaldo to win the Ballon d'Or. We're so proud of him - he's improving all the small details.

Ronaldo's scoring streak for club and country this season is exceptional, and he will want to continue that on his former ground

'He's making so many goals and wants more and more - even in training. Next is to break the records for himself. He's almost perfect. It's difficult to say what he's missing.

But the Portuguese defender did admit that it would still be a tough ask facing Messi and co on Tuesday night.

Carvalho said the tie should not just be seen as Messi v Ronaldo, with other stars like Angel di Maria on show
