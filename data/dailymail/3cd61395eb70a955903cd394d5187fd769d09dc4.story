The lifeless body of 'Amazing Race' producer Jeff Rice was found on the balcony of the Serena hotel in Uganda, blood pouring from his nose and mouth.

Next to him lay his unconscious assistant, Katheryne Fuller, who is recovering in hospital but is being held in Uganda until police determine if she has committed drugs offences.

Survivor: Katheryne Fuller, who was found unconscious in a Ugandan hotel next to the lifeless body of 'Amazing Race' producer Jeff Rice, is recovering in hospital

An autopsy revealed that Rice died of a 
cocaine overdose and had large quantities of the drug in his stomach, 
according to Ugandan police.

South African Fuller also tested positive for cocaine, police told ABC News. The presence of the drug in large quantities has fuelled speculation that the two were involved in a smuggling operation.

Forensics have now determined that other drugs were also present at the scene.

Dr Stephen Cina, a forensic pathology consultant, said. 'The bag of white powder that was found on scene is a mixture of a component of heroin and some Tylenol and some caffeine.

'So that certainly suggests that at least in that bag there's a mixture of several substances present.'

The pair who were in Kampala, Uganda, to
 film a documentary, were originally thought to have been poisoned. But 
police have now ruled out this theory. Uganda Police Force spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told ABC News. 'This is a very wrong account,'

However friends believe they were forced to ingest it after a failed shakedown. Others fear they were targeted because they were working on an investigative documentary, ABC News reported.

But police insist the pair willingly ingested the substance.

'There was no struggle. These were two people in their room and there was not a single sign of a struggle. Not even a single bruise on Rice's body,' Mugenyi said.

Fuller's father is in Kampala and wants to take her home to South Africa for medical treatment, but Mugenyi indicated this may not happen for some time.

'Ms. Fuller is slowly recovering, and when she is recovered enough we will be able to talk to her and find out more about what happened,' he told ABC News.

 the Hotel balcony seated in his chair head bending over the table while
 bleeding through both mouth and the nose'

'She is not able to speak. Although she is responding to the treatment, she is not yet available to explain what transpired.'

Fuller's father Stuart Fuller said the family just want to get their daughter home. 'She is OK. We are trying to get her back to South Africa. She needs medical attention that they can't do here,' he said.

To complicate her return home Fuller's wallet and passport are missing from the hotel room, a family friend told ABC News.

Creative: His company website describes Rice as 'the ideas man'

Rice's wife Sally Blackman told English language online Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor she would not speculate about her husband's death. She said: 'I would not like to speculate or even attempt to give my views on this as this may jeopardise the investigation going forward.'

Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, an addiction specialist at Stony Brook University, told Fox News that the most likely reason for cocaine in the stomach would be from a bungled smuggling operation or forced ingestion.

He said: 'If someone were to snort very large amounts of cocaine, there could have been some trace amounts from nasal drip into the stomach. But if the concentration was found in the stomach, that’s likely a result of smuggling or ingestion.'

'A typical overdose from the traditional methods of using cocaine is not going to be in the stomach. If it was found in his stomach, it could absolutely have been the result of poisoning if he was forced to ingest it.'

Father-of-two Rice and his assistant were part of a team that helped create 
challenges across Africa for the CBS show, The Amazing Race.

They
 were not working on the show at the time of their collapse 
but they had helped with the current season, which hit screens on Sunday

Loss: Production facilitator Jeff Rice (left, pictured with his brother), who worked for TV show The Amazing Race, has died after he was poisoned in Uganda

Success: Rice, with Ghanaian footballer Asamoah Gyan, ran SB Productions

Rice, originally from the United States,
 had worked in Los Angeles, California for five years before moving to 
Durban in South Africa.

He married Blackman in 2001 and they went on to have two children, now aged seven and one. He had planned to travel home this week to celebrate his daughter's second birthday.

'Jeff was a dedicated father who made the most of his time with his family when back home in South Africa,' his wife told FoxNews.com.

'He has left a huge void, not only in the film industry, but with his family he has left behind. We will miss his smiles and constant humor.'

In 1999, Rice and Blackman founded SB Productions, 
which produces and facilitates films, adverts, documentaries 
and television shows.

Grief: Adventurer and TV personality Josh Gates expressed his shock

Tragedy: Adventurer Josh Gates tweeted a picture of him and Rice. He wrote: 'A photo with Jeff Rice in Madagascar. I can't believe you're gone, buddy'

Its website describes Rice as 'the ideas man... His mind is always churning'.

'Jeff has an incredible calm nature 
and a wicked sense of humour,' it writes. 'Having played baseball as a 
kid, he is always ready for the next curve ball. Jeff has the knack for 
putting together great teams.'

He also ran the production company Maverick Entertainment, which had employed the assistant.

His wife said it had been his intention for the company to work throughout Africa.

'He loved the 
African people and was driven to share in all the various cultures,' she said.

Among other projects, Rice worked on Animal Planet's Whale Wars and the South African version of The Biggest Loser.

As a facilitator, Rice would have been 
hired by the production company to make arrangements with local 
officials before teams arrived for filming.

Friends of the late producer flocked to Twitter to express their shock at his untimely death.

American TV personality and adventurer Josh Gates wrote: 'Floored by the loss of my dear friend and adventurer, Jeff Rice. You were, quite simply, the real deal. I'll never forget you.'

Gates tweeted a picture of the two men, writing: 'A photo with Jeff Rice in Madagascar. I can't believe you're gone, buddy.'
