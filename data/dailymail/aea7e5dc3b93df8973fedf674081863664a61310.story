Glyn Ricardo Ballard, 50, was jailed for 12 years for a string of historic child sex attacks

A former children's train driver at Longleat Safari Park has been jailed for 12 years for a string of historic child sex attacks.

Glyn Ricardo Ballard, 50, sexually assaulted and threatened two daughters of someone he knew in the early 1980s when the eldest sister was just 10 years old, a court heard.

More than 20 years later he raped a 15-year-old girl before taking up a job at the Wiltshire safari park, where he worked on a children's ride until last year. He left before he was arrested

Ballard sexually assaulted the sisters in 1982 and raped the 15-year-old girl between May 2004 and January 2005.

His victims told Winchester Crown Court that the abuse had haunted them and one said she had tried to kill herself.

Just months after the rape of the 15-year-old, Ballard got a job driving Longleat Safari Park's Jungle Express train, a position he held from 2005 until 2013.

Prosecuting, Philip Warren read out the victim's impact statements. One said: 'Being sexually abused as a child has caused me problems throughout life.

'I have had depression and counselling, and at the worst point I tried to commit suicide.'

Another read: 'Being raped has affected my ability to make friends and relationships. I do not trust anyone and put barriers up.

'It also causes me problems if someone gets too close to me physically, or touches me, and I freeze and it brings back memories of what happened.'

Defending Ballard, Fern Russell said the defendant was a teenager when the first sexual assaults happened, adding: 'He has not offended in any form for ten years.'

Ballard, of Warminster, Wiltshire, was found guilty of rape, seven counts of incident assault, one sexual assault on a girl under 16, and having sex with a minor.

Judge Guy Boney QC said Ballard, who came into contact with children on a daily basis, was a danger to young girls.

Jailing Ballard, the judge said: 'The bottom line is you know no boundaries where sex is concerned, apart from your own gratification. 

'[He was] a skilful liar and knew no boundaries. There was no doubt that he posed a risk to young girls.' 

Detective Constable Dave Topp of Wiltshire Poice said: 'We are satisfied with the result and we hope it will encourage other victims to come forward regardless of when offences were committed against them.'
