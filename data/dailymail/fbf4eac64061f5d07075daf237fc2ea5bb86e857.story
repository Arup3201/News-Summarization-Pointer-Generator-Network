Ben Foster has been ruled out until October after surgery showed he had damaged his anterior cruciate ligament.

It was tonight he had suffered a cartilage injury during the victory over Stoke keeping him out for a month, but exploratory operator revealed the extent of his problem.

The injury will keep Foster out for the next six months in a huge blow for West Bromwich Albion as well as England manager Roy Hodgson, who needs a deputy for Joe Hart.

Dr Mark Gillett, who as Director of Performance heads up Albion's sports science and medical team, said: 'Ben is in good spirits despite this obvious disappointment to him – he's already talking about his 'rehab' and wanting to get started on it immediately.

'But he has had a cruciate reconstruction of his left knee following the injury against Stoke and he will be out for six months.'
