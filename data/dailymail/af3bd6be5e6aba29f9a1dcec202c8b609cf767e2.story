Anthea Turner has broken her silence over claims her husband cheated on her with an interior designer less than half her age, revealing she's 'heartbroken and devastated'.

The television presenter, 52, threw 50-year-old Grant Bovey out of their £5million marital home after being told he had been seen kissing country heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan in a London restaurant.

And today she spoke out about the reports by releasing a statement on the state of her marriage of 12 years.

Turner revealed she is both 
'heartbroken' and 'devastated' over the breakdown of their relationship 
and the affair rumours, but she declined to comment any further.

Bovey's alleged romance with the 
24-year-old is said to have started while Miss Turner was working on a 
TV show in Canada to help support her husband financially.

A close friend of Miss Turner told the Mail that she confronted Mr Bovey last week after becoming suspicious about his behaviour.

The friend said: ‘Anthea had  an inkling that Grant was having an affair. After a long talk, they decided they needed some distance between them and he has now moved out of their home. Anthea was in a very dazed and confused state at first, but now the anger is settling in and she is furious.

‘All I can think is that Grant is having some kind of mid-life crisis.’

Mr Bovey, who left his first wife, Della, for Miss Turner in 1998, is believed to have insisted that Miss de Mallet Morgan is merely a friend. He is understood to be staying at a London hotel while Miss Turner – who is being comforted by her stepdaughters Lily, 20, Amelia, 19, and Claudia, 16 – considers the future of their marriage.

Mr Bovey declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday.

He said: ‘It’s concerning my private life, so I don’t have anything to say about it at all.’

Considering her future: Anthea Turner, with Grant Bovey, is said to be devastated

Miss de Mallet Morgan comes from wealthy country stock. Her parents Tommy and Louise – nicknamed Lulu – are millionaires and live in a picturesque hamlet near Godalming in Surrey.

Yesterday, at the stunning family lodge, which is set in acres of land, a neighbour said: ‘The family are very private, but I understand that Zoe has got herself in a pickle.’

Mr de Mallet Morgan works at the top end of the property market for Savills, with a career portfolio that includes the sale of The Dorchester hotel in London. His wife is a health consultant, who was featured on the cover of Country Life magazine in 1976 when the couple’s engagement was announced.

Their daughter has worked for interior design firm Roozels, where she has helped to fit out luxury properties in Mayfair and Kensington, since 2008.

Miss Turner, who found fame on Blue Peter, before presenting breakfast programme GMTV, was once married to former Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell. But her golden girl image was shattered when it was disclosed she was having an affair with Mr Bovey, who was a family friend. 

She and Mr Bovey went on to marry but their wedding in 2000 was a public relations disaster when it was revealed the couple had signed a £450,000 contract to pose for a magazine shoot while eating a new chocolate bar.

Miss Turner subsequently struggled to find mainstream presenting work and took part in Channel 4’s reality series Celebrity Big Brother in 2001.

She and Mr Bovey moved into the property business, launching Imagine Homes, which became Britain’s biggest buy-to-let property firm. But it was one of the first victims  of the financial crisis when it went into administration in 2008 with debts of up to £50million.

Mr Bovey was discharged from bankruptcy in March 2011 and a month later he and Miss Turner moved into their new multi-million-pound home in Esher, Surrey, where neighbours include England footballer John Terry and TV presenter Chris Tarrant.

Two years ago, Miss Turner signed up to appear as a judge for Canadian reality series Dinner Party Wars, on Food Network Canada.

The friend added: ‘Anthea was the breadwinner in the family and while she’s been working as hard as she can, Grant has been doing this.

‘She wasn’t even away that much – she would go to Canada for three weeks at a time and then come back for two weeks.

‘Grant has yet to actually admit to cheating on Anthea, but the fact that he has moved out without an argument says volumes.’

A spokesman for Miss Turner said: ‘Anthea is heartbroken and asks for her privacy.’
