A Tory MP who dismissed the way a D-Day veteran starved to death in hospital as 'a negative experience' has been forced to apologise for his 'stupid mistake'.

Albert Buck, 84, lost eight stone in just two months at Darent Valley Hospital in Kent after being admitted with a fractured hip.

His family were angry with the way he had been treated, and so wrote to Darftord MP Gareth Johnson asking him to take up the case.

But the former solicitor did not read the email properly and replied: 'I am sorry to hear your ­father had a negative experience.

'If your father lives in my constituency and you wish me to raise this matter with the primary care trust please return the enclosed form to me.'

Albert's son Michael was 'staggered' by the reply.

He said: 'Dad was among the troops who liberated Belsen but died looking like one of the inmates, thanks to Darent Valley Hospital.'

Michael's brother Chris told the Sunday Mirror: 'I have little confidence in the NHS.

 I am now even more ­concerned about the folk that ­represent us in the seat of government.'

Mr Johnson, who has now promised to set up a meeting between the family and the hospital, later met with the brothers and, according to Chris, 'could not apologise enough'.

He said: 'Mr Johnson accepted the blame and said he’d made a stupid mistake.'

Darent Valley has one of the worst rates for patient deaths in the ­country and its A&E department is in the bottom 10, with low levels of weekend staffing.

A Facebook group exists called 'Darent Valley Hospital is the worst hospital ever'.

It currently has 90 members.
