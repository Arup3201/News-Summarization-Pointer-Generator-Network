An emotional Kevin Ware broke down in tears today as he described how his Louisville teammates came through for him while doctors worked to repair his horrifically broken leg.

The Louisville guard was speaking out in his first round of television interviews for the first time since his injury on Sunday night, thanking fans for their support and promised he would do his best to return to the court.

Ware said he will travel to the Final Four on his crutches and expects to be a big presence for the Cardinals on the team bench as they take on Wichita State on Saturday.

Cleared by doctors to accompany 
Louisville to Atlanta, the sophomore told The Associated Press that he 
plans to be a full participant in the team's preparation for the game.

Ware admitted to a gaggle of reporters at the university that he did not know Louisville had gone on to win the game until he woke up on Monday morning, with the NCAA trophy by his side.

His eyes watered as ESPN's Rece Davis asked him what that moment meant to him.

With tears streaming down his face, Ware told Davis: 'It meant everything to me. They went out there and did that for me.'

'Words can’t explain. I love those guys to death. I wouldn’t trade them in for the world.Those are the brothers I never had. And I just keep telling them the job ain’t done yet.'

Speaking of the moment of the injury, he told ESPN: 'I honestly didn't feel pain. It was more shock. I've never felt anything like that.'

Donning a 'Win it for Kevin' team shirt, Ware said the overwhelming support he 
has received has helped him maintain his spirits and strengthened his 
confidence of a full recovery.

He hopes by next season to be helping the Cardinals defend the national championship he believes they'll win this weekend.

The normally reserved 20-year-old calmly recalled how he felt when he suffered the devastating injury, saying he doesn't think Louisville would be in the Final Four if he had lost his composure.

Ware told reporters during a press conference that he had no prior problems with his leg before the horrific injury, which forced six inches of his leg bone to break through his skin.

He told reporters: 'When I went to contest the shot, it was like I always do. I guess I just landed wrong and I didn’t see where I was landing.'

Ware credits teammate Luke Hancock for calming him down.

He said: 'Luke is a great guy. From the time he's been here he's just been the leader.'

'Once he said his prayer, I was kind of thinking the whole time, "you can either be a crybaby about it or you're going to get your team back and get them in the right mindset."

'Luke said his words, and I just kept repeating, "y'all gotta go win this game. I'm fine." It really helped the team.'

While the injury may have gotten Ware worldwide attention - and more than 100,000 new Twitter followers - he says he never stopped thinking about his fellow Cardinals.

'Nothing like seeing my teammates. We're brothers and I wouldn’t trade these guys in for anything in the world.'

But it wasn't easy for the Cardinals, many of whom cried after seeing Ware's gruesome injury.

Even Louisville coach Rick Pitino was emotional, wiping tears from his eyes and later saying that the sight of his player's injury almost made him vomit.

The Cardinals eventually regrouped to lead at halftime en route to an 85-63 victory over the Duke Blue Devils in Indianapolis.

'It was very powerful. I was very very very proud of my team.'

Through it all, Ware said he had to remain strong. He was placed on a stretcher and wheeled out of Lucas Oil Stadium to cheers of 'Kevin Ware, Kevin Ware,' before heading to Methodist Hospital.

Joined by his mother Lisa Junior at the press conference, who told reporters: 'He's a very resilient young man... He's always had some adversity in his life that he had to overcome.'

Mrs Junior said she would not suffocate Ware as he recovers, but she will 'be there.'

Ware underwent a two-hour operation to repair compound fractures of the tibia that left the leg at an odd angle.

He awoke the next morning to discover he had become an overnight sensation, and the afterglow hasn't waned.

His condition and progress have been featured every day on the major networks, the Internet and especially social media.

The Cardinals' practice facility was surrounded by a phalanx of satellite trucks, and the interview requests helped Ware get an early jump on his rehab as he shuttled back and forth between makeshift sets.

Ware said he has heard from several of his NBA idols, including Kevin Durant and Charles Barkley.

During the press conference, however, he said the most memorable interaction was the conversation he had with Kobe Bryant on Twitter.

The Louisville guard said he has even heard from the Rev Jesse Jackson and Michelle Obama.

For the soft-spoken Ware, the support and media attention has meant more interviews than he ever imagined.

'I had no idea I would get this kind of attention,' he said. 'I'm one of those guys who just likes to play basketball. But the injury opened up a lot of peoples' eyes and I really appreciate all the support. It really means a lot.'

He said that even though he will be on the bench for the game on Saturday, he hopes he can contribute to another Louisville victory.

He said: 'I don't have to tell them anything. I think they just look to the bench and they just see all the motivation we need.'
