The companions she grew up with included a lion, a chimp and a polar bear.

June Williams had a doll and a cuddly teddy, of course, but you'd be more likely to find her snuggling up to a penguin. Nor would it have been unusual to spot her  posing for photographs with her head in a pelican's bill, or maybe sitting on an elephant's knee.

And while other children might have been content to play hop-scotch or skipping games, June  preferred dancing with goats.

It sounds like a fantasy world created
 by a little girl who adored animals. But June grew up with them all as 
her father founded and built up what is now the UK's biggest zoo.

And
 — at the age of 87 — June has thrown open a treasured album of 
black-and-white photos to reveal her delightful relationship with her 
family of animal friends. Her story is part of a BBC1 drama,  Our Zoo, 
charting the founding of Chester Zoo by its eccentric owner George 
Mottershead, June's father.

Yesterday
 in advance of the launch of the mini-series, June recalled: 'It was 
very exciting growing up surrounded by all these animals and it was an 
amazing feeling having them as friends — I never thought my childhood 
was unusual.

'I would always 
try to help out by working in the shop, locking up gates and then, on 
days when staff were off, I'd help out a bit more with the animals. I 
loved every minute of it.'

Looking cheery: In 1930, the Mottershead family owned only one gibbon and two goats - but more than 80 years on, the zoo now boasts an enormous collection of animals

Ex-serviceman
 George paid £3,500 for a small area of land around Oakfield House in 
Chester in 1930 and moved into the house with his wife Lucy, daughter 
June, then aged four, and her sister Muriel.

The
 only animals the family had were two goats, later joined by a gibbon. 
The first  animals acquired specifically for the zoo were two bears from
 a wildlife park in Matlock, Derbyshire.

Neighbours
 worried that the animals would escape, but Mr Mottershead continued to 
stock it with exotic and sometimes dangerous beasts, including lions.

Getting to work: Ms Williams said it was 'an amazing feeling' counting animals among her friends. Above, Mr Mottershead and Mary the chimp work on the enclosure

Relatives: 'It was very exciting growing up as a young girl surrounded by these animals,' said the pensioner. Left, Mr Mottershead and, right, Ms Williams's sister, Muriel

Yet
 June's fondest memory is of her bond with a lion cub, Christy, which 
she hand-reared after its mother died giving birth to another cub. Her 
greatest disappointment was to learn that her father swapped Christy for
 a polar bear and had the lion shipped to France without telling her.

June married and moved to Australia in 1954, but returned later to work at the zoo.

Now
 a widow, she lives a stone's throw from the grounds of the zoo, which 
boats 11,000 animals from 400 species. 'It's reassuring to live so 
close,' she said. 'I had some great times there.'

Educational: 'Obviously the war happened not too long after and that halted progress,' she added. Above, a photo showing a nine-year-old June reading to a chimpanzee

Ms Williams, whose husband, Fred, died in 2012, said she wasn't aware her childhood was unusual at the time - and only realised how lucky she had been to grow up at the zoo years later.

'I was only four and a half when my father bought the zoo,' she said. 'There was a bad reaction to it at first because people were frightened of the noise and whether the wild animals might get out.

'In those days, Upton had lots of large houses and businessmen living there and they didn't want something like this coming in and taking over.

Motherly duties: During her time at the zoo, Ms Williams hand reared her own lion cub, Christy, after its mother died giving birth. Above, June, 19, is pictured with Christy

Dancing through life: The pensioner spent her 
childhood and early twenties helping at the zoo, before leaving to work 
in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s

'I never thought my childhood was 
unusual as it's just your parents and your home - you grow up all the 
same and don't know any different.'

The pensioner spent her childhood and early twenties helping at the zoo, before leaving to work in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s.

She even hand reared her own lion cub, Christy, after its mother died giving birth to another cub - but the pair were later torn apart when her father sold the lion to a French buyer in return for a polar bear.

'As a child, I would always try to help out by working in the shop, locking up gates and then on days when staff were off, I would help out a bit more with the animals,' said Ms Williams.

Family business: Ms Williams's grandfather, Albert (left), had a key role in the opening of Chester Zoo, while her father, George (right), was the facility's official founder

'When I was much older, I was in charge of the aquarium, a job I did for quite a few years. It was incredibly disappointing to lose Christy, but such is life.

'My husband and I moved away in 1954 to live in Australia and New Zealand just so we could see a bit of the world. We did quite a few jobs out there but the highlight for me was working as a waitress on the Great Barrier Reef.

'My
 husband mainly worked as a handyman and because we had a caravan we 
could travel around the country and see some of the sights.'

After
 travelling to the other side of the world, Ms Williams and her husband 
returned to work at the zoo, where there had been several new additions.

Still smiling: Since 2012, Ms Williams (pictured in front of a portrait of her father) has lived alone in Oakfield Drive, just a stone's throw away from the zoo's grounds

'We were out in Australia and New Zealand for about three years and when we returned to the UK there were a fair few noticeable changes at the zoo,' she said.

'I went back to working in the aquarium and Fred helped out with a lot of the planning for building work as the zoo really started to expand.

'I don't remember when exactly it was but myself and Fred moved to Rhosneigr on Anglesey after we retired and by that point the zoo had grown ever so much.

'At the beginning we only had a few animals but by then there were at least two or three of every animal and the amount of land we had was incredible.

'It was a very interesting childhood and I loved every minute of it. I have got some incredible memories.'

Since her husband's death in 2012, Ms Williams has lived alone in Oakfield Drive, situated just a stone's throw away from the zoo's grounds.

'It is very reassuring to live so close to where I spent most of my childhood because I have had some great times there,' she said.

'I think the new TV show will be very exciting and I hope people can enjoy seeing how the zoo became what it is today.'

The TV series, Our Zoo, featuring Inspector George Gently star Lee Ingleby and Life on Mars actress Liz White, will be screened on BBC1.
