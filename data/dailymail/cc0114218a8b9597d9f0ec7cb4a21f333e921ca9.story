Two British researchers detained in Qatar while looking into the poor treatment of migrant workers as the Gulf state prepares to host the 2022 World Cup have been released.

Researcher Krishna Upadhyaya, 52, and photographer Ghimire Gundev, 36, from London, went missing in the Qatari capital of Doha on August 31 as they were preparing to leave the country.

Qatari authorities confirmed on Saturday that the pair were arrested for unspecified violations of Qatari law.

The men's employer, the Global Network for Rights and Development (GNRD), yesterday said the men had been set free but had not yet left Qatar. The group said it does not have details on the reason for their detention.

The group said it spoke to Upadhyaya on Monday night and that both men were doing well. It said: 'The news is a fantastic relief for the families ... and all those who have been following the case.'

The Global Network for Rights and Development, which is based in Stavanger, Norway, describes itself on its website as a neutral organization set up in 2008 to promote human rights and development.

It has been critical of Qatar's treatment of migrant workers in the past. 

Qatar, like other Gulf Arab states, relies on vast numbers of mainly Asian low-paid migrant workers. 

Labor rights activists have raised concerns about dangerous working conditions, allegations of unpaid salaries and other abuses since Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup.

Qatar has said the men were arrested for 'having violated the provisions of the laws of the state of Qatar.' Officials in Doha had no immediate comment on the men's release. 

Upadhyaya and Gundev had been due to fly from Doha to London on Sunday but failed to arrive at the airport.

The GNRD said the pair had 'feared they might be in danger' after being harassed by police and had decided to leave the country when they disappeared.

They had reportedly been looking in to reports of poor treatment of Nepalese migrant workers as Qatar prepares to stage the football World Cup in 2022.
