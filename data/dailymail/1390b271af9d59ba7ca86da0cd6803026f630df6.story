He was the midfield destroyer who captained Arsenal to an unbeaten season in 2003-04, towering above opponents and driving the Gunners to the Premier League title.

And after posting a picture of himself playing at age 14 on Twitter, it appears  Patrick Vieira was always head and shoulders above most players on the pitch.

The Frenchman, who was playing for FC Drouais - based in Dreux, near Paris - 24 years ago, took to the social media site to share the image along with the message: 'This takes me back… here I am aged 14 #TBT! Join in and share your childhood sports photos using #PassForSchool.'

The hashtag #PassForSchool relates to a campaign by Europa League partners Western Union, who are calling on football fans to share their childhood sports photos on Twitter. 

Vieira, who also enjoyed playing spells with Cannes, AC Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan and Man City, hung up his boots in 2011 to become a coach at the Etihad.

The 38-year-old is now the manager of City's elite development squad but is willing to move on if the right opportunity allows him to move into first-team management.
