Snow plow drivers are in deep trouble after they intentionally buried a state owned vehicle beneath a giant mound of snow. Â 

Little did the drivers of the snow plow know that surveillance cameras were watching their every dig.

Video shows the snow plow heading straight for a state transportation truck that was left at the Southborough, Mass. Public Works yard all day and night on February 5.

A storm left Southborough with 11 inches, and the snow plow driver decided to put most of that remaining snow on the truck in the lot.

CBS footage shows how other cars moved so that the snow plow could do it's work but that one truck remained stationary.

The driver who uses the truck lives in Southborough but is not permitted to drive state vehicles home with him when he is not working.

He is meant to keep them in in municipal lots.

When the driver discovered his truck beneath tons of snow and finally dug it out the next day, he noticed that the left rear corner panel was dented.

No Charges were filed and the incident will not be addressed publicly but Southborough's city Manager Mark Purple said the employees would be disciplined.

'The fact that the vehicle was completely covered to the extent that you could not tell there was a vehicle under the snow exhibits that the behavior was intentional, said Purple.

The drivers, whose names have not been released, have apologized for their actions. They wont be causing anymore mischief--on camera, that is.
