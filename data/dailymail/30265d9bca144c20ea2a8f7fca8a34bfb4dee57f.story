An Oregon high school teacher yanked a female student through a doorway and yanked the girl's shirt up in the process, revealing her body.

A dispute between the Roberts Alternative High School Annex teacher and her students allegedly caused nearby Sara Rue to suffer a panic attack, Rue told KOIN.

Rue's attempt to get out of the classroom was thwarted by the shirt-grabbing teacher, the affiliate station reported.

'I opened the door. I was already out of the classroom,' Rue told KOIN. 'She decided to wrap her arm around my neck, pull me back into the classroom.

'My sweatshirt came off – the entire thing came off – and the whole class saw me naked. And after that, I just started crying hysterically.

'It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.'

She explained to The Statesman Journal 'I'm really self conscious about my body so (the class) just saw how fat I am and all that stuff. I can't believe that happened.' 

Rue instructed her peers to look the other way before she was fully clothed again, the 15-year-old told KOIN.

Skirmish: Rue was left on the floor with her shirt yanked up, exposing her to her peers 

Though a police officer went to high school, there were no arrests, but the school district is looking into the matter, KOIN reported.

'We have to find out through the investigation what the state of mind was, why she was doing it, why she put her hands on the student,' school district spokesman Jay Remy told the affiliate station.

Rue told KPTV, 'I could have asked if I could leave the class. I could have said I need to leave.'

But, she also told the media outlet 'She doesn't even have any right to put her hands on me.'

Rue's teacher Carrie McCann is on leave from the school, KPTV reported.
