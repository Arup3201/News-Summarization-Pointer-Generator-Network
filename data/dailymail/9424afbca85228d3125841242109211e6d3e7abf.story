CLICK HERE to read agent's claims that Di Maria would have stayed at Real Madrid for less money than he gets at Manchester United

Angel di Maria has claimed Real Madrid ordered him not to play in the World Cup final. 

Manchester United's new £60million British record signing has already blamed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez for his departure from the European champions, insisting that he originally had no intention to leave this summer.

Di Maria was a doubt ahead of the World Cup final against Germany in July with a thigh injury, and he has revealed that the decision for him to miss out was made by Alejandro Sabella, Argentina's then coach, and not Madrid who had sent a letter advising him to sit it out.

Back in action: Angel di Maria has claimed Real Madrid sent him the letter on the day of the World Cup final

Claims: The Argentinian attacking midfielder says his former club Real asked him not to play against Germany

Return: Manchester United's Di Maria was subsequently sidelined in the World Cup final defeat by a thigh injury

'I got a letter from Madrid that arrived at 11am on the day of the (World Cup final) asking me not to play.

'We were playing at 4pm and I was preparing myself to be in the best condition, knowing that I could have got injured.

'As soon as I got that letter, I ripped it up. I did not care, no matter what.'

'What I love the most is playing with Argentina,' said Di Maria. 'I received a letter at 11am from Real Madrid, on the day of the game while I was in physio, trying to be the best I could be for the final, telling me to not play in the World Cup final. I was thinking about playing in the final, although I knew that if I did there was a 90percent chance I’d re-injure myself. When I read it, I ripped up the letter. I suffered a lot that morning. That was the worst thing to ever happen in my life. I didn’t speak to anyone at the club about this. It doesn’t matter. In the end, it was Sabella who made the decision and it was for the best.'

Talking to Argentine radio programme America y Closs, Di Maria added: 'I talked with Alejandro and it was his decision. I didn't want to pressure him. I knew I could have to come off after 15 minutes and leave the team, I didn't want that.'

Di Maria and Madrid president Perez have been involved in a public row in recent weeks with the 67-year-old suggesting the player moved for the money. Perez, criticised for allowing the Argentine winger to leave, claimed that only Cristiano Ronaldo would have earned more at the Santiago Bernabeu had Di Maria signed a contract extension.

Di Maria, who will trigger a bonus payment to Madrid should he win the Ballon d'Or with United, said: 'I saw what he said. To be able to earn what Cristiano earns I would have had to have been the best player at the World Cup or won the Ballon d'Or. It looks like he [Perez] gave that offer to another person. I don't have a clue who he offered that to. I don't have much of a relationship with him. When I signed a new deal he wasn't there either.

'I never said I wanted to leave Real Madrid, I never wanted that, but you have to move when they don't want you. Let them say what they want about me, the millions they received for selling me will help the Real Madrid economy very well.'

Di Maria also confirmed reports that Ronaldo wanted him to stay and that the former Manchester United winger could yet lose patience with Perez himself.

'Cristiano was always on my side. I don't know how much he will put up with at Real Madrid.'

Di Maria made his Manchester United debut in a goalless draw against Burnley before the international break and maintains that he will need time.

'I'm very happy but still I have to adapt,. I hope we can put Manchester United back where they deserve to be. I had got used to the style of play in Spain, now I have to adapt as soon as possible.

'I don't know how to speak English yet, they have given me a teacher. I call [Juan] Mata so he can help me.

Insistent: Perez says Real offered Di Maria the chance to be the second-best paid player at the Spanish club

'I hope we can put Manchester United back where they belong. I’m still used to the La Liga style of play and I need to adapt as soon as possible.'

Di Maria's representative Eugenio Lopez says the winger would have stayed at Real Madrid for less money.

Talking to Spanish radio station Cadena Cope, Lopez said: 'The idea was to wait and come to an agreement with Real Madrid in order for him to stay. He wanted to earn what they promised him and he would’ve stayed for much less than Manchester United is paying him.

'He signed until 2018, but he wanted to improve his deal. Which is normal. They brought in Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez. That was a sign that something was wrong. But they didn’t bring in James because Di Maria wanted to leave. They are very different players.

'Before the World Cup there was no offer from Real Madrid. He never asked for £6.3m per year and would’ve stayed for much less, even though there was a club who offered more.

'We started to negotiate, but Real Madrid didn’t budge. I’m speaking in reference of what Florentino Perez said. Ancelotti did everything he could to keep Di Maria.

'When they played Atletico Madrid in the Supercopa, the ovation from the crowd was tremendous. He’s only a fan of Rosario Central, but he loves Real Madrid.'
