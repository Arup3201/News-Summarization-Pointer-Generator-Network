Drug addicts caught with Class A substances like heroin and cocaine should not be 'chucked' in jail, Nick Clegg has claimed.

The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'utterly senseless' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use.

But the Home Office insisted the courts need to have the power to imprison serious offenders who cause 'the most harm in our communities'.

Nick Clegg said it was 'utterly senseless' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use

Mr Clegg has repeatedly put himself at odds with the official government position on drugs.

He has called for a Royal Commission to examine all drug laws, something David Cameron rejects.

Now Mr Clegg has vowed that at the next election the Lib Dems will promise to abolish prison sentences for drug possession.

Mr Clegg said: 'Drugs do untold harm to individuals and to communities. We need a radically smarter approach if we are serious about tackling this problem.

'Liberal Democrats believe the first step is to recognise that drug use is primarily a health problem. Addicts need treatment, not locking up. It is a nonsense to waste scarce resources on prison cells for cannabis users.

'Simply chucking people into prison and turning a blind eye is the lazy option because all it ends up doing is making the problem worse.

Heroin addicts are to be given foil for free in a bid to encourage them to inhale the drug

Drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance.

Users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class-A drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as HIV.

Aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high.

Under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts, but the new rules, thought up by the Home Office, would end this practice.

The scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs.'

'I've always believed that if you're anti-drugs you should be pro-reform. That's why we will ensure nobody will go to prison where their only offence is possession of drugs for their own personal use.

'Instead these people should receive non-custodial sentences and addicts should get the treatment they need to stop using drugs.

'These reforms will ensure that drug users get the help they need and that taxpayers don't foot the bill for a system that doesn't work.' 

More than 1,000 people a year in England and Wales are jailed for possession of drugs for their own personal use.

Mr Clegg says half are for possession of cannabis, but says millions of people know 'intuitively that it does not make sense chucking a 22-year-old into prison for the possession of cannabis. The people who should be behind bars are the criminal gangs, the Mr Bigs'.

He argues that the UK should approach the drug problem as a health rather than a law and order issue.

In a swipe at Mr Cameron's party, he said the Tories were slow to realise that it was time to rethink drugs laws.

Mr Clegg added: 'The Conservatives are what it says on the tin — they are conservatives. They take a long time sometimes to move with the times.

'If there was evidence that banging them up works then all their misplaced tough talk would be justified. But it does not work.'

The Lib Dem manifesto will include a commitment to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and move the drugs and alcohol policy lead from the Home Office to the Department of Health.

In addition, the party will promise to establish a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches, including further work on diverting users into treatment or into civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record, which can seriously affect their chances of employment.

However, the Home Office defended the current law. A spokesman said: 'Drugs destroy lives and cause misery to families and communities and this Government has no intention of decriminalising them.

'The vast majority of people caught in possession of an illegal drug are not imprisoned, with only 3 per cent of offenders found guilty of a drug possession offence last year being sentenced to immediate custody.

'It is vital that the police and criminal justice system have a range of measures available to them, including community-based interventions.

'But law enforcement and the criminal justice system must also have the tools to deal robustly with serious and repeat offenders who cause the most harm in our communities.'
