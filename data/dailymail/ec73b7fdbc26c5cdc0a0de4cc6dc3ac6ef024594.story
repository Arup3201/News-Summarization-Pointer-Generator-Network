Pupils are not learning to think for themselves because teachers are ‘playing safe’ and setting work that is too easy, an adviser to Prince Charles will warn today.

Many youngsters are not being stretched at school because staff shy away from topics that are too theoretical, according to Bernice McCabe, a headmistress and co-director of the Prince’s Teaching Institute.

Some teachers may be bowing to the ‘tyranny of league tables and targets’, fearing they will lose ground in the rankings if the material they cover is too challenging.

In music, for example, many teachers fail to introduce pupils to crucial aspects of music theory such as time signatures and scales because they are trying to ensure lessons are accessible to all.

This has led to Ofsted branding some classes ‘unchallenging, demotivating and sometimes dreary’.

Mrs McCabe, head of North London Collegiate, a high-performing private girls’ school, will deliver the warning as she welcomes delegates to the Prince’s 18th course for teachers. In a keynote speech at Cambridge University, she will describe how the Prince set up the institute 12 years ago to allow teachers to improve subject knowledge.

Mrs McCabe will tell teachers their role is to help children learn to make critical judgments of their own. But she will claim pupils ‘will be less likely to think for themselves if you are too accommodating’.

She will warn teachers against ‘playing safe and submitting to the tyranny of league tables’, adding: ‘It is all too easy as a teacher to fall back into the familiar routines, opt for the safe topics, stay within your comfort zone. But what excitement is there in that? If it’s too easy, there is little gained.

‘Teaching is a matter of leading your pupils to higher ground, until they have the confidence to continue climbing by themselves.

‘It is the job of the teacher to motivate, to make difficult things accessible and enjoyable.’

Mrs McCabe recently helped the Government shape its new, more rigorous national curriculum for primary and secondary schools.

Ofsted last year reviewed a three-year Government drive to raise standards of music education, following a damning report.

It said that despite the programme, most of the schools inspected were still ‘unduly worried that pupils might not enjoy lessons that included music theory’.

It added: ‘Sadly, the laudable wish for musical learning to be relevant, accessible and enjoyable too often ends in a curriculum that is unchallenging, demotivating and sometimes dreary.'

Primary education is more important than secondary in helping poor children succeed, a study claims.

Drives to improve primary learning in the 1990s have led to better GCSEs years later, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, while secondary policies have had less of an effect.

Poor pupils in London were up to 50 per cent more likely to get five good GCSEs in 2012 than those elsewhere in England, says the study. It suggests literacy and numeracy hours – which were introduced in London primary schools first – are the main reason for this.
