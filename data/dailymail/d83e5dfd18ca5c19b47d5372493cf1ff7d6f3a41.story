US presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal has parroted claims there are 'no-go zones' for non-Muslims in Britain - just one week after Fox News was forced to apologise for the same gaffe.

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society, in London, that  Muslims have been allowed to establish autonomous neighbourhoods, governed by a harsh version of Islamic law, and which police refuse to go into.

He said some immigrants are seeking 'to colonise Western countries, because setting up your own enclave and demanding recognition of a no-go zone are exactly that.' 

It comes just one week after a Fox News pundit claimed that Birmingham is closed to non-Muslims sparking a backlash from bemused residents of the city.

Visiting US presidential hopeful Bobby Jindal has claimed there are 'no-go zones' for non-Muslims in Britain - just one week after Fox News was forced to apologise for a similar gaffe

Steven Emerson, a self-styled expert on terrorism, was participating in a Fox News discussion in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris.

'In Britain, it's not just no-go zones,' he claimed. 'There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in.'

Prime Minister David Cameron responded by calling Emerson a 'complete idiot', adding: 'When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge.' 

The pundit later apologised for his blunder - just 22 per cent of the city's residents are Muslim, compared to 46 per cent describing themselves as Christian. 

Amidst the backlash, he announced that he would donate £500 to Birmingham Children's Hospital in a bid to atone for his 'terrible, inexcusable error'.

Mr Jindal said: 'The huge issue, the big issue in non-assimilation is the fact that you have people that want to come to our country but not adopt our values, not adopt our language and in some cases want to set apart their own enclaves and hold onto their own values'

Jindal, however, used similar rhetoric during a speech, warning of 'no-go zones' in London and other Western cities. 

He also said Muslim leaders must condemn the people who commit terrorism in the name of faith as 'murderers who are going to hell.'

The Republican - who lived in England while studying at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar - is considering a presidential campaign in 2016. 

Three members of a so-called 'Muslim Patrol' were jailed in 2013 at the Old Bailey for repeatedly trying to enforce Sharia law in East London.

Jordan Horner and another Islamic extremist told one couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street, because it was in a 'Muslim area'.

The radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road, and told a woman she would face 'hell fire' because of the way she was dressed.

Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively. 

He later defended — and repeated — the statement after facing reporters' questions about his claims. 

'I knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset,' Jindal told CNN during an interview from London.

'The huge issue, the big issue in non-assimilation is the fact that you have people that want to come to our country but not adopt our values, not adopt our language and in some cases want to set apart their own enclaves and hold onto their own values,' said Jindal. 'I think that's dangerous.' 

'The bigger point is that radical Islam is a threat to our way of life,' Jindal said. 

Asked if he regretted talking about 'no-go zones,' Jindal replied: 'Not at all.'

During the CNN interview, he also said that there were areas where women did not feel comfortable going 'without a veil' and where police refused to go. 

Jindal, whose parents immigrated to the United States from India more than 40 years ago, is in his second term as governor of Louisiana and is barred by law from seeking a third term later this year. The 43-year-old is already laying the groundwork for a presidential bid.

Jindal spoke to the Henry Jackson Society, a British think tank named for a former U.S. Democratic senator from Washington state who was a presidential candidate in the 1970s.

Democrats said Jindal's comments were a blunder.

'It's no surprise that Bobby Jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people; this is exactly what we've come to expect from Jindal here at home,' said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif. 

'Jindal is just embarrassing himself.'
