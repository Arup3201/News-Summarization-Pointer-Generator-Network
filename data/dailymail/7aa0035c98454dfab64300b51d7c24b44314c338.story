England's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay has left millions depressed, but these images lampooning captain Steven Gerrard and even the Queen might raise a wry smile as they swept across the internet today.

The memes also celebrate Luis Suarez, the destroyer of Roy Hodgson's side's World Cup hopes, and show the Liverpool striker who scored twice last night as Superman and even with Her Majesty in a headlock.

Others included a dig at Gerrard, whose backheader led to Uruguay's second goal, and a Scotland fan celebrating wildly with Uruguayans in Sao Paulo.

Many have been produced by England fans themselves, proving that even on another dark day for the Three Lions, they still have a sense of humour despite more World Cup disappointment.
