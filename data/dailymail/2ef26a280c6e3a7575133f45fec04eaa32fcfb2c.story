Two prisoners who killed and disembowelled a fellow inmate so they could eat his liver have been sentenced to life imprisonment today.

Michael Parr and Nathan Mann were told by the judge they'd spend the rest of their lives behind bars after they were sentenced for the gruesome death of Mitchell Harrison.

Harrison, 23 was serving an indefinite sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl at Durham’s Frankland Prison when he was killed last October.

Michael Parr, 33, pleaded guilty to murder while fellow inmate Nathan Mann pleaded guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.

Sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Justice Openshaw said: 'I consider this to be a murder of peculiar and unusual brutality.

'Because of the risk these prisoners pose I cannot envisage the circumstances where either of them are ever released.

'They will face the fact that they may well end their lives in prison.'

During sentencing, Mann was described as a 'classic cold, callous and homicidal psycopath'.

It was heard he had harboured fantasies about killing and of cannibalism, and along with Parr had planned to live out their twisted urges together.

The
pair had talked about consuming their victim’s liver and had 
deliberately targeted Harrison, who was at the time serving at least 
four-and-a-half years for the rape which happened in Kendal, Cumbria, 
because they believed he was arrogant.

On the morning of October 1 2011, Parr and Mann had lured Harrison’s into Mann’s cell before launching the brutal attack.

Mann attempted to strangle him and then stabbed him in the eye with a biro pen, before slashing his neck with a weapon made from plastic cutlery and razor blades.

As Mann inflicted the gruesome attack, it was heard how Parr held the victim down by his legs.

Harrison’s abdomen was then cut open exposing his small intestine, but despite their initial plans to remove the victim’s liver, it was heard that the defendants were 'unable to go through with it'.

There was no suggestion that the deceased’s liver had been removed, the court heard.

Robert QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'Officers went to check the cell and found the deceased lying on the bed.

'Nathan Mann reported that they had just killed someone.

'The defendant said he had wanted to kill someone and that they did not really like the victim and he had appeared arrogant.

'There was a large open wound to the left side of the deceased’s neck.

'His abdomen was exposed, his small intestine was protruded.'

Both men were already serving life sentences at Frankland prisons.

Mann was serving a life sentence with a minimum of 24 years for the vicious murder of two woman aged 72 and 56, at a nursing home in Leicestershire, in 2010

Parr was serving a life sentence in 2003 for the attempted murder of a patient in a psychiatric hospital.

In interviews with police after the attack, both said they had harboured fantasies about killing, while Parr said he was 'excited' that he found someone in Mann with whom he shared a common interest.

Mr Smith QC told the court that prior to Harrison’s death, Mann had warned prison staff that he would kill someone, but that these had been dismissed as threats.

A note written by Mann was also discovered after the attack, which outlined his reasoning for wanting to kill someone.

The two killers and their victim were inmates at Frankland Prison, in Durham

Mr Smith QC said: 'The investigation into the death revealed Nathan Mann had written a note.

'He had described he did not have the guts to kill himself but did have the guts to kill someone else.

'He could not handle the fact that he had killed two vulnerable people.

'He said in the note he could not handle the voices in his head and the belief that someone was going to kill him.

'He said killing someone was the only way he thought he would be segregated from everything.'

Similarly before the incident, Parr had told a psychiatric nurse that he had fantasies of chopping off fellow prisoners’ heads and cutting open their stomachs.

During the sentence, a doctor’s report on Mann was read out, which described him as possessing compulsive homicidal urges.

It also referred to the defendant as a “classic cold, callous and homicidal psychopath.”

In sentencing both, Mr Justice Openshaw said it was clear both had set out to commit the attack together.

He added: 'The victim was targeted, it was their intention to cut him open and then to eat his liver.'In fact they desisted but not until they had cut him open.'

Parr was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 32 years.

Mann was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 16 years on top of his current sentence.
