Despite allegations that he murdered someone, the National Football League's Player Association - the union that represents NFL players - is attempting to recover bonus money the New England Patriots owes the former tight end, as he sits in jail awaiting trial.

Hernandez was released by the Patriots in June after he was arrested for the alleged murder of semi-pro football player Odin Loyd. The NFLPA says the Patriots owe the former University of Florida star the $82,000 bonus he was promised for showing up to off-season workouts.

The union makes it fairly clear that the grievance it filed is procedural, and they would do it for any player - regardless of whether they've been charged with murder.

Charged: Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez is currently in jail awaiting trial on charges that he murdered a semi-pro football player

Odin Lloyd, 27, was shot five times less than a mile from Hernandez's home

'On behalf of all players, it is our responsibility to protect the rights in the collective bargaining agreement,' the NFLPA said in a written statement. 'We are not tone-deaf to what the allegations are in this case, but for the benefit of all players, there are important precedents here we must protect.'

Deadspin reports that the case will go before an independent arbiter in coming weeks.

Police currently are investigating whether Hernandez killed Lloyd 
because he knew about a double murder the disgraced New England Patriots
player is suspected of committing.

Hernandez
is currently awaiting trial, charged with killing Lloyd in an 
industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts,
on June 18.

Numerous 
reports indicate that police now suspect Hernandez could also be 
responsible for the deaths of two immigrants from Cape Verde in Boston 
in July 2012. He has not been charged in that case.

The Boston Globe reported earlier this month that a police source said Lloyd could have been killed because he had knowledge of the double-slaying.

Prosecutors have not commented publicly on the motive behind the murder of Lloyd, a 27-year-old player for the semi-professional Boston Bandits.

Previous reports from Boston TV stations have quoted law enforcement sources as saying that Lloyd was killed for 'talking to the wrong people' while he was out with Hernandez at a club the night prior to his death.

Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty and professed his innocence from his jail cell. He has hired a high-powered defense lawyer to fight the charges.

Last year, the New England Patriots signed the tight end to a four-year, $40million contract. When he was charged, the team dropped him.

Within a week of Hernandez's arrest in Odin's shooting, reports began to emerge that police were also investigating his involvement in the 2012 double-murder.

Court records revealed that an SUV registered to Hernandez, which police believe was seen fleeing the scene of the shooting, was recovered at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol, Connecticut.

According to Boston police, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, were shot outside a Boston club when a passing SUV fired several shots into their car.

The club shooting case is now in front of a grand jury, which will determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges.

The Globe report provides a detailed view of Hernandez's ties to his hometown of Bristol and other allegations leading up to his arrest for murder.

The newspaper suggests that Hernandez was largely on the straight and narrow - finished high school at age 17 and an honor student before moving on to the University of Florida - before the death of his father.

Dennis Hernandez loomed huge in the life of his son Aaron and ensured his nose stayed in the books and his feet stayed on the field and off the street.

When Mr Hernandez died during routine surgery in 2006, Hernandez went into free fall.

The Globe claims that it was then that Hernandez began using drugs and surrounding himself with rough characters from Bristol, including ex-cons.
