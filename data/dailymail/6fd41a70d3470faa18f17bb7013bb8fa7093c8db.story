Amazon is planning to open its first physical store in Manhattan, it has been claimed.

The firm has signed a lease on a building on 34 Street, opposite the Empire State Building, the Wall Street Journal said.

It would act as a pickup and returns centre for customers, as well as a showroom for the firm's Kindle line. 

Amazon's new store will be opposite the Empire State Building. It will act as a pickup and returns centre for customers, as well as a showroom for the firm's Kindle line.

In some locations, instead of delivering a parcel an address, Amazon customers can opt for their purchases to be dropped at a locker location. 

This removes the risk of being out when it is delivered in the post.

Once the parcel arrives at the locker, the buyer will get an e-mail notification with a unique pick-up code and a barcode.

The email will also include details of when the lockers - often located in stores - are open.

When the customer arrives at the locker, they then enter the pick-up code or scan the barcode, releasing the package.

Opening a physical location is 'about marketing the Amazon brand,' said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analys told the WSJ. 

'Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.'

People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon's plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities,it is claimed.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach's department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. 

There are two loading docks at the back of the building, useful for bringing merchandise in and out.

It is believed the location was chosen to take advantage of the footfall of tourists.

The Empire State Building last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory, and Macy's flagship store nearby draws more than 20 million annual visitors. 

Amazon already offers a locker option in New York.
