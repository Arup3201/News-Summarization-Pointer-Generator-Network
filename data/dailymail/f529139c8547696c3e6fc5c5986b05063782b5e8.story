Roberto Soldado seems to be a bit of a sharp shooter on and off the field as the Tottenham striker revealed he is a fan of the video game series Call of Duty.

The Spaniard sent a message to Tottenham team-mates Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker, Mousa Dembele, Kyle Naughton, Erik Lamela and Harry Kane to say he had purchased the latest edition of Call of Duty. 

It did not take long for Soldado to get his hands on a copy of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare as the game was released during the early hours of Monday morning.

The Tottenham striker was not the only one to take to social media to reveal they had purchased the PlayStation and Xbox game. 

Premier League trio Ryan Bertrand, Cesar Azpilicueta and Kane have offered their followers a chance to play against them on Xbox.

Sheffield Wednesday winger Royston Drenthe, who earlier in the day posted a picture of himself queuing up to buy the new game, said he was 'ready for war'.

Crystal Palace midfielder Barry Bannan also could not wait to play the new Call of Duty as he managed to play it on Sunday night.
