Islamic State supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from Tunisia.

Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq.

Emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white Arab scarf.

His earlier life: Emino (pictured left) was previously one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime

Sudden change: Having previously used his social media page to proudly show off his body, Emino's most recent photograph (left) was captioned with a declaration of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

Strangely posed holding a small brown and white goat, the once wannabe gangster wrote that he had given his allegiance to the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Emino was one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime.

Previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies.

One of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women, with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass.

Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined ISIS over the last few years.

German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State. Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam.

American failed rapper Douglas McAuthur McCain was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS last August.

McCain, who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct, is thought to have converted to Islam in 2004.

After travelling to Istanbul, McCain crossed the border and entered Syria sometime in June 2014.

His body was identified by his distinctive neck tattoo, a hallmark of his wilder days in Minnesota.

Tunisia has long been a hot-bed of would be jihadist sympathetic to the ISIS cause, with an estimated 3,000 people fighting in Syria – the highest number of any country.

The north African country has always been a breeding ground for terrorists, with extremists advantage of bored and jobless young men looking for an escape route.

But the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard-line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the Jasmine Revolution in 2011 - including Islamist militant group Ansar al Sharia, which the United States brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis.

The government also released a number of fundamentalists from prison – allowing them to mix freely with the population once more.

These groups have taken advantage of the declining economy, capitalising on the disappointment felt by those who expected a change after the Arab Spring, according to Imen Triki, a lawyer who represents returning jihadists.

‘The Arab revolutions raised an expectation that wasn't met – people thought their lives would improve, but instead they got worse,” Mr Triki told The Telegraph.

‘In Syria, they are told they’ll get houses, they’ll get wives. These people are so alienated from our society that some choose this option in a heartbeat.’

Social media is also blamed, with pictures of ISIS fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using Facebook to find any potential fighters, much like is seen in the UK.

But with the rise of ISIS in Libya, to the east, and al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Algeria, to the west, it is now easy to join a ‘jihad’, and get arms into Tunisia itself.

‘Tunisia is surrounded by jihadist groups in the mountains who coordinate with the terrorists in Libya ... Libya is the main source of arms for jihadists in Tunisia,’ said Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa. 

But despite this, Tunisia is seen as the success story of the Arab Spring, and tourist numbers have been on the increase once more as people begin to feel the area is safe once more.

In 2013, 6.27million people visited Tunisia. Of those, almost 330,000 were British, while 985,000 were French.
