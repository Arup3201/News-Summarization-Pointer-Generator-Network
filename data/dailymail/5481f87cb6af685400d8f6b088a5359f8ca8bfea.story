The 36-year-old man arrested on suspicion of raping Karen Danczuk says he feels as though he is part of an 'X Factor sob story'.

The suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says he was left 'shaking with fear' after being arrested on Sunday over child abuse claims made by the 31-year-old.

Mrs Danczuk, the wife of crusading anti-child sex abuse MP Simon, revealed last week that she was allegedly raped and sexually assaulted 'hundreds of times' as a child at her family home in Manchester.

Mrs Danczuk, pictured with her Labour MP husband Simon, said she was abused from the age of six 

After some members of family disputed her version of events, Mrs Danczuk reported the allegations to police, who arrested the suspect at his home in Rochdale.

Speaking from his home, which is just a few miles from where Mrs Danczuk lives, he told The Sun: 'I feel like I am living in a soap opera - that's the best way to describe it. It's not real.'

He added: 'Everyone likes an X Factor sob story don't they? It's seems to be the way of the world these days.' 

The man, who was questioned for six hours, has been bailed by Greater Manchester Police until April 30.

Mrs Danczuk, who has became well known for Twitter selfies showing off her cleavage, claims the abuse took place between 1989 and 1995 when she was aged between six and 11.

She told how her selfies were rooted in the abuse she suffered as a child and are a defiant way of reclaiming control over her alleged attacker. 

Mrs Danczuk said she was regularly abused in the bedroom of her family home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, shortly after her parents' marriage broke up.

In response to the arrest, Mrs Danczuk tweeted that she would never forgive those who doubted her claims

Her father Martin Burke, now 73, moved out, leaving Mrs Danczuk, three older brothers and an older sister living with their mother Susan Burke. 

Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother Susan Burke (pictured) 

But Mrs Danczuk's claims were branded a 'figment of her imagination' by her mother, as well as two of her four siblings who challenged her story.

Mrs Burke, 58, called her daughter an 'attention-seeker'. The war of words led Mrs Danczuk to report her claims to the police 'as a matter of urgency, to prove I am telling the truth'.

After news of the arrest, the mother-of-two tweeted: 'For all those who doubted me, publicly slated me & made me feel like scum for coming out. I will NEVER forgive & NEVER forget!' 

She later said she felt 'more numb than angry' and her rage is instead directed at her mother.

She said: 'I am not a fantasist. I am telling the truth. I was raped or sexually abused hundreds of times.

'She did nothing to protect me and I will never forgive her.'

Asked why she had waited two decades to name her attacker, she said: 'Because I am still coming to terms with it. It is a very difficult thing to confront – as any paedophile victim will know.'

DI Caroline Ward of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We work hard to support victims of sexual offences and thoroughly investigate all reports of sexual abuse and rape no matter how long ago they happened.

'We will do everything we can to support victims and bring offenders to justice.'
