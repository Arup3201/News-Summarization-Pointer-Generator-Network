The Jacksonville Jaguars are the NFL's youngest roster. It showed, too.

An error-strewn performance saw missed tackles galore and three turnovers, one from a muffed punt inside their own 10-yard line.

Arguably it turned the game. The Jags were 7-3 up and had reduced Tony Romo, playing with two fractured vertebrae, to a field goal from his opening two drives.

Ace Sanders muffs Chris Jones' punt in the first quarter to hand the ball back to Dallas and sap momentum

The hardened veteran was not in the mood to return the charity. He looked calm in the red zone, gingerly rolling to his right on third down, finding Jason Witten with a two-yard pass. The score was the first of 28 unanswered points, and the game was over as a contest by half-time.

Punt returner Ace Sanders was honest in his appraisal, saying: 'The ball slipped through my fingers. You need to secure the ball first and then worry about what comes next. And I didn't do that. It was very out of character. I need to make some adjustments.

'It definitely happens, but at the same time, you never want it to.'

Gus Bradley focuses on the game but Jacksonville suffered their second defeat in two years in London 

Coach Gus Bradley appeared frustrated at seeing the same mistakes, week-in, week-out.

'I don't have any real concerns with our effort, with our courage, with our toughness. It's just those self inflicted things, and it's just focus, concentration, whatever the case is. Those things, I think are what causes some frustration,'

A particular problem is the inability to tackle, as Bradley continued.

'Well, it wasn't very good right away in the first half. I don't know how many we missed, but it disappeared. We had some sloppiness.'

Tony Romo was protected by his offensive line magnificently, with Jags recording just one sack

Dez Bryant burned the Jags' defense on two long touchdown passes, beating man coverage, finding space at will and skipping hapless attempts to stop him.

For his second score, a 68-yarder just before the break, he carried safety Johnathan Cyprien for the last 10 yards.

'Yes, I took a bad angle. I took a bad angle, and instead of just trying to get him out of bounds, I reached for him, kind of put the ball this way. It doesn't matter, I missed him, and that can't happen,'  a dejected Cyprien said. 

With rookie quarterback Blake Bortles under center, it is bound to be a year of ups and downs.

He started the game excellently, finding Allen Robinson and Cecil Shorts III before Denard Robinson went over from 33 yards. 

Bortles spoke of the undulating nature of his youthful side.

'I mean, the first drive we went down was a really good drive. The offensive line did well. We ran well. Cecil had a play and Denard broke a big run. We came back the second drive and hurt ourselves with the penalty and kind of shot ourselves in the foot for two or three drives after that and never really could get it rolling again.'

As they fly home to Florida, the Jags are 1-9 for the third straight season. And with their propensity to shoot themselves in the foot, it is tough to see where their next victory will come from.
