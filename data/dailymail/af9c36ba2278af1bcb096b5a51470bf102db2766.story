It's an agonising dilemma faced by every bride-to-be around the world: just what to wear on her special wedding day?

But spare a thought for the women of Siberia, where harsh winters can last for up to nine months of the year.

And while those preparing to walk down the aisle in the UK or the US pray the rain keeps away, in this part of eastern Russia they simply hope they get a nice 'warm' day -- with temperatures even a little milder than minus 40C.

What to wear on your wedding day takes on a different dimension when temperatures are -40 degrees 

Serbian brides are forced to wear thermal leggings and thick boots under their dress to protect them

Photographer Vera Salnitskaya recommends grooms use make-up on their noses and ears to hide the red 

Winter's in this part of Russia typically last nine months and warmer -40 is considered a good temperature 

Now the secrets behind keeping the frozen snow brides of Siberia happy have emerged from one of the region's top photographers.

From recommending their footwear - definitely no high heels - to hiding thermals under their dresses, Vera Salnitskaya has perfected the art of helping Russian women realise their dream of becoming a real-life ice princess for a day.

'Why do couples choose to marry in winter here? Well, what choice do they have in a place where winter may last for nine months,' the 30-year-old, from Novosibirsk, told The Siberian Times.

'The first couple I ever took pictures of were called Ekaterina and Sergey.

'It was December and it wasn't very cold, only about minus 20C perhaps, but still when the bride was taking her coat off to pose with her naked arms and shoulders I was shaking my head and hurrying her to get dressed.

'I told her, 'You'll get cold' but she answered back, 'Never mind that - I want to look beautiful'.

'Oh that brides' desire to be beautiful. The thing is, the coats that are offered in wedding dress shops are made from teddy bear skin. They are pure synthetics and, frankly, I think that it would be warmer without them than in them.

'The coats are usually short with the neck open to every wind.

'And no, you can't put an ordinary coat above the 'princess dress', and it is often too expensive to buy a luxurious real fur coat.'

As well as the dress, Serbian brides must consider their wedding coat, with this bride opting for a bold red which contrasts beautifully with the surrounding snow

Not a typical aisle, but Russian citizen's are used to marrying against a backdrop of thick snow 

Vera says that brides' desire to look like a princess in their wedding photos often see them brave the arctic weather  

Vera advises staying well covered up to the neck, but still struggles to keep couples outside for longer than 10 minutes  

Vera warns that many of the coats available at bridal shops are simply not warm enough 

So what to do? Many years experiencing the harsh winters has helped Vera come up with the answers - techniques seldom needed in Europe and America.

'On their legs you can put warm thick tights or thermals under the dress,' she says. 'I am very strict with my brides in saying that they can choose anything they like - as long as their legs and feet are warm. So traditional Russian Valenki [felt boots] or Uggs are good.

'Typically the wedding dress is long and it is more important to keep their legs warm than to catch a fever after posing in high heel shoes in the middle of a snow drift.

'They do usually listen to me, but sometimes that desire to be beautiful wins over common sense.

'I remember a bride called Natasha whose wedding was in January, when it was minus 30C. I spoke to her a day before the wedding day about warm shoes, and as we left the house I asked her again if she had taken the boots.

'She said 'yes' but when we come to the park she jumps out of the car in her delicate shoes and thin white tights into the snow.

'I'm standing with my camera, in warm Valenkis, thermals, three pair of trousers above the thermals, a thick coat, gloves and a very warm hat.

Ideally, Vera says a thick real fur coat should be worn, but she says many can not afford them 

Vera herself dresses up in multiple layers to capture the shots, and the shoots tend to be brief! 

Despite the challenges that the extreme cold poses, it makes for a dramatic backdrop for the stunning shots

'The absurdity of it is that the dress is so long the pictures don't even show what kind of footwear the bride has on.'

Vera continues: 'I am always asking my brides to be take something warm with them. It doesn't matter what it us, just as long as they can have it when we are walking from the car to the area where they'll pose for me.

'I also ask them to wrap something around their necks. I think the person that invented the typical style of wedding coats have only seen real snow in American Christmas movies.

Born in a village near Novosibirsk, Vera graduated from the electromechanical faculty at Novosibirsk Technical University before starting her working life as a designer.

But she is now one of the Siberian city's top photographers, working with a number of local newspapers in addition to her weddings.

What perplexes her most is the fact that people in this part of the world expect long and harsh winters, yet forget how cold the weather might be on their big day.

'I think often winter weddings are planned in the house, without going out and feeling what it would be like to pose barely dressed,' she laughs.

Wanting to look beautiful can win over common sense as one bride shuns Uggs for heels and thin tights 

'Of course when discussing their ideal images all couples promise that they will be ready to run around in the snow, make snowmen, go ice skating, you name it.

'But you are lucky if you can take them for longer than ten minutes out of the car. They get immediately cold and start shivering, and their noses, ears and hands get bright red. And then naturally there is no point in taking pictures.'

Surprisingly Vera says the grooms do not fare any better than their brides.

'Unlike the brides they have to wear shoes,' she explains. 'I remember one wedding, of Anastasia and Anatoly, on February 15. She is happily jumping about in her comfortable Uggs, and he is turning into an icicle in his fashionable shoes.

'He says to me, 'She's lucky, she's got her feet warm. But I am getting frozen here'.'

Vera says she now has to pass on her words of weather wisdom to the Siberian men before they go for their photo shoots, with some unusual fashion tips thrown in.

She says: 'I tell them to take good hats as their ears go bright red within seconds of being outside. Also the make-up shouldn't only be about the brides, and grooms too should put some tone on their noses and ears.

'We also take tea with brandy, or tea with ginger and lemon -- it helps, but not for long.'

And with another laugh she adds: 'The best way to protect yourself against the freezing temperature is a beautiful skiing costume But no bride would go for that.'
