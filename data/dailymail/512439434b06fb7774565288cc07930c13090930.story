A man accused of defaced a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey yesterday will appear in court today.

Tim Haries, 41, from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday charged with criminal damage over £5,000.

The Fathers4Justice campaigner is accused of defacing to have scrawled the word ‘Help’ in turquoise paint across the canvas on Thursday.

A man was allegedly wrestled to the ground by Westminster Abbey security guards and held until police arrived.

The oil painting, by Australian-born Ralph Heimans, had been on show in the Chapter House for only a few weeks.

Mr Haries, an electrical engineer, is said to have travelled to 
London from his home in Doncaster to join a Downing Street protest by 
campaigning group Fathers 4 Justice.

He is separated from his wife Jenny and has two daughters aged 13 and ten.

The Abbey has confirmed the incident, which occurred at lunchtime yesterday.  A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, Scotland Yard said

A statement from the artist Mr Heimans was read out to the court in which he confirmed that the 11ft by 9ft painting was produced in 2012 during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year

The attack took place as dozens of 
visitors were in the Abbey at lunchtime. Mr Haries was arrested on 
suspicion of criminal damage and taken to Charing Cross police station. 
It is understood the attack was caught on CCTV.

A member of staff at the Abbey, who 
did not want to be named, said: ‘The security guards need to take some 
of the blame. They are meant to search people’s bags as they go through 
the doors.’

Involved: Fathers 4 Justice has claimed that the protest was carried out by one of its members

Jolly Stanesby, of Fathers 4 Justice,
 said the Queen’s portrait was chosen because her ‘badge’ is on the wall
 of ‘every family court in the country’.

He said: ‘We need equality in the family courts.’

The 9ft by 11ft painting depicts the 
Queen in the Sacrarium of Westminster Abbey, also known as the 
Coronation Theatre. It shows her, in a moment of solitary reflection, on
 the spot where she was crowned.

Staff have removed it from display 
and hope it can be repaired with the help of Mr Heimans, who is based in
 London. A spokesman for the artist declined to comment.

Stunt: Fathers4Justice's most famous protest came in 2004, when Jason Hatch scaled Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman

A
 spokesman for Westminster Abbey said: 'In an incident at lunch-time today a visitor to the 
Abbey sprayed paint on the Ralph Heimans portrait of The Queen, 
presently on display in the Chapter House.

'Until work can be done to remedy the damage it will – very regrettably – not be possible to have the painting on public view.'

Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the incident.

Fathers 4 Justice was founded in the UK by Matt O'Connor, a marketing consultant, Following separation from his wife in 2000, Mr O'Connor became a prominent critic of UK family law after a court barred him from seeing his young sons outside of a contact centre.

F4J's stated aim is to champion the cause of equal parenting, family law reform and equal contact for divorced parents with children. It is well known for its campaigning techniques of dramatic protest stunts, usually dressed as comic book superheroes and frequently scaling public buildings, bridges and monuments.

Stunts have included supporters storming courts dressed in Father Christmas outfits, clapping the Children’s Minister in handcuffs, and group member Jason Hatch climbing onto Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman.

The portrait of the Queen pictures 
her in a moment of quiet reflection as she stands on the spot in 
Westminster Abbey where she was crowned 60 years ago.

Artist
 Ralph Heimans said he sought to capture 'her humanity' in the 9ft by 
11ft portrait, commissioned by the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

Her majesty posed for an hour-long sitting in the Yellow Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace in March.

Mr Heimans then imagined the dramatic backdrop – the Sacrarium at Westminster Abbey, also known as the Coronation Theatre.

She stands on the Cosmati pavement – a 
spot where every English monarch has been crowned since it was 
commissioned by Henry III in the 13th century.

Mr Heimans, said: 'I hope there is a degree of humanity uncommon in traditional Royal portraits.

'I wanted her expression to be open to interpretation so that people could imagine what she was thinking at that moment, but I think there is a sense of tenderness and soulfulness, as well as nostalgia and contemplation.

'But there is also a suggestion of her inner strength. She has an extraordinary aura and a real energy and presence.'

The painting is entitled The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

A spokesman for Mr Heimans said the artist was 'aware of the incident' yesterday, but would not be commenting further.

Five people were arrested in the Palace of Westminster while protesting during a visit by Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada.

Environmental campaigners against 'tar sands', a form of fuel which produces more emissions than conventional oil, have posted a video showing them on the roof of Parliament, with a statement saying they wanted to disrupt the premier’s address to MPs and peers.

The 'Love Canada Hate Tar Sands' site said: 'We have entered Parliament to interrupt Harper’s speech.

'We have managed to climb onto the roof with t-shirts saying "oil out of politics", "stop Harper" and "stop the tar sands". Two campaigners have spilled molasses on the floor outside of Parliament.'

Controversy: Activists are angry about Mr Harper's support of developing energy from 'tar sands'

Shortly before Mr Harper’s speech the doors slammed shut on the robing room, where the Queen puts on the Imperial State Crown and her ceremonial robes for the state opening of Parliament, and shouting was heard.

In a separate protest, the UK Tar Sands Network held a demonstration outside Parliament as Mr Harper arrived, with around 50 people campaigning against extraction of oil from the tar sands in the boreal forests of Canada.

The group wants the British Government to support EU measures which could label the tar sands as more polluting than conventional oil and discourage its future importing.

Mr Harper’s speech to parliamentarians went ahead undisturbed and was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Talks: Mr Harper lavished praised on David Cameron during his speech to MPs and peers

The Canadian leader heaped praise on David Cameron during the address, telling Parliament he admired the Prime Minister’s 'determined and principled leadership' and valued the friendship between the two nations.

The speech was followed by private talks between the two premiers.

Scotland Yard confirmed that two male protesters and one female demonstrator were arrested shortly before midday for trespassing on a protected site after being found in a non-public area of the Palace of Westminster.

They said two further women were arrested outside Black Rod's Entrance on suspicion of criminal damage.

Police said they were aware of reports that appear to show the group on the roof.
