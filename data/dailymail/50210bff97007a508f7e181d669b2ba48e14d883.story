Accused: Dave Lee Travis pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today for his assault trial

Dave Lee Travis denounced his accusers
 as money-grabbers in police interviews, but also conceded he was ‘not 
an angel’, a court was told yesterday.

The
 former radio DJ and Top of the Pops presenter said he had met millions 
of people during his long career but had always acted professionally.

He
 accused those who claim he sexually assaulted them of ‘imagining’ the 
attacks and dismissed their allegations as ‘ridiculous’.

In
 17 hours of police interviews, Travis, known as DLT, said he was an 
easy target in a money-grabbing culture.

Southwark Crown Court was told 
he described the allegations as ‘complete and utter nonsense’ and 
‘absolute c**p’.

He claimed that many of his accusers came forward simply to make money from the media.

Reading
 from the transcripts, prosecutor Teresa Hay said Travis felt the 
allegations against him were ‘degrading’ and he could barely remember 
the women involved.

‘He said if he had touched someone’s breasts he 
would admit it as it was considered to be flirtatious at the time and no
 one thought much about it,’ she said.

‘He
 said he did not take advantage of people. If any of it had been true he
 would put his hand up and say it was the norm in that period.

'But as 
far as these women were concerned, he did not touch them.

‘He
 didn’t mess around with young girls. He felt he was in the firing line 
and people could take shots at him if they want.

'The Press had no morals
 and now his morals were being questioned.’

Travis,
 68, appearing in court under his real name David Patrick Griffin, sat 
in silence as sections of the police interviews were read to the jury.

He was interviewed under caution four times over 10 months after he was 
first arrested in November 2012.

He is on trial accused of indecently 
and sexually assaulting 11 women, the youngest of whom was 15 years old,
 over a period of 32 years.

Speaking
 about the many women he met, Travis said he was a ‘tactile’ person but 
was sensible and knew where the line of appropriate behaviour was.

‘He said everyone got opportunities,’ Mrs Hay said. ‘But he said, “If you live in a sweet shop you don’t eat sweets”. ’

Travis
 told detectives he had been happily married since 1971 but appeared to 
clam up when asked if he had any affairs.

Quoting his reply, Mrs Hay 
said: ‘His marriage was rock solid...even if he had strayed and had an 
affair, what did that have to do with this?’

She added: ‘Even if he thought a woman looked nice he would not “dive in” because he was married.’

Travis
 was asked about his relationship with Jimmy Savile, who was exposed as a
 prolific paedophile after his death. He said they were colleagues, not 
friends, and suggested Savile was an ‘oddball’.

Travis
 admitted he knew Savile liked young girls and thought ‘good luck to 
him’, but added he did not think they were under the legal age of sexual
 consent.

Mrs Hay said Travis would have reported Savile if he knew he was a paedophile and was genuinely shocked by the scandal.

During the interviews, Travis admitted that groping was seen by some as the ‘norm’ in the 1970s but insisted he did not do it.

Travis denies all the allegations. The trial continues.
