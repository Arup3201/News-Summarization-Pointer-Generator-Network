After sitting on the sidelines for much of the primary season, Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is endorsing Mitt Romney to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee.

Bush made the announcement in a statement released today after Romney's win in the Illinois primary by 12 points last night.

Bush congratulated Romney on his success  and urged Republicans to 'unite' behind the former Massachusetts governor.

'Congratulations to Governor Mitt 
Romney on his win last night and to all the candidates for a hard 
fought, thoughtful debate and primary season,' Bush said in the 
statement.

'Primary elections have been held in 
thirty-four states, and now is the time for Republicans to unite behind 
Governor Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job 
creation to all voters this fall.'

Confirming that he was endorsing Romney, he continued that the country was facing 'huge challenges'.

'We need a leader who understands the 
economy, recognizes more government regulation is not the answer, 
believes in entrepreneurial capitalism and works to ensure that all 
Americans have the opportunity to succeed.'

Despite big losses on Super Tuesday and in the South last week, Mitt Romney retains a massive advantage in the number of convention delegates.

If he continues at this pace, he will reach the 1,144 needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination at the GOP convention in August.

(All numbers exclude Tuesday's win, which offers 59 delegates awarded by Congressional district.)

Mitt Romney: 522

Victories: New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Arizona, Wyoming, Washington, Ohio, Virginia, Massachusetts, Idaho, Alaska, Vermont, Guam, Northern Marianas, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, American Samoa and Puerto Rico

Rick Santorum: 253

Victories: Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi

Newt Gingrich: 135

Victories: South Carolina and Georgia

Ron Paul: 50

Victories: None

Until now, Bush, who is the brother of
former president George W. Bush, had declined to endorse a candidate, 
including during the Florida primary, during which he told Bloomberg he 
would 'stay neutral'.

'He has been watching the race and 
made the decision to endorse this morning. He called Gov. Romney this 
morning,' a Bush spokesman told CBS News.

Only last month, Bush had criticized the 
rhetoric being used in the Republican presidential debates saying he 
found it 'a little troubling' as candidates appeared to appealing to 
people's 'fears and emotion' rather than political concerns.

The victory last night was an 
important one because it was in a Mid-Western state, it followed a 
double loss to Santorum in the Deep South last week and it extended 
Romney’s delegate lead making it all but mathematically impossible his 
rivals achieve the 1,144 needed for outright victory.

Romney had emailed his supporters 
Tuesday night that his Illinois win 'means we are that much closer to 
securing the nomination, uniting our party, and taking on President 
Obama.'

He urged the party to fall in line behind his bid, saying 'We are almost there.'

Polls show Romney has the advantage 
heading toward Maryland's April 3 primary. But the South, where 
Louisiana votes on Saturday, has proven less hospitable to Romney.

As well as Pennsylvania, Santorum expects
to win in the Louisiana and then Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22. He 
has also set his sights on a big win in Texas, which offers 155 
delegates and which holds a primary on May 29.

Key win: While Romney's victory in Illinois will not end the GOP primary, his wide margin has greatly bolstered his status as front-runner

Santorum sounded like anything but a defeated contender Tuesday night as he spoke to supporters in Gettysburg. He said he had outpolled Romney in downstate Illinois and the areas "that conservatives and Republicans populate."

'We're very happy about that and we're happy about the delegates we're going to get, too,' he said before invoking Illinois-born Republican icon Ronald Reagan, the actor turned president. 'Saddle up, like Reagan did in the cowboy movies.'

Gingrich didn't speak to supporters Tuesday, instead putting out a written statement. Texas Rep. Ron Paul has yet to win a state.

Romney triumphed in Illinois after benefiting from a crushing 7-1 advantage in the television advertising wars, and as his chief rival struggled to overcome self-imposed political wounds in the marathon race to pick an opponent to Obama.
