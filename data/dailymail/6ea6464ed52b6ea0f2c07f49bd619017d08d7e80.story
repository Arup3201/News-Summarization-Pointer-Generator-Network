High fashion to high street: Kate Moss, pictured in Versace's F/W campaign, has a less glamorous business deal in the pipeline

She has landed campaigns with some of the world’s most glamorous brands.

But Kate Moss’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth – the supermodel is now the face of high street phone-seller Carphone Warehouse.

Miss Moss, who has posed for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry, is working on a range of smartphone cases for an undisclosed fee.

The collection, due to launch later in the summer, will ‘apply Kate’s sensibility to the latest handsets’, the retailer said last night.

The company recruited the 39-year-old model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’ – or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out’ for something more stylish than cheap plastic cases.

For Moss, it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in Paris or Milan, but Carphone believes adding her touch to the humble phone case will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon.

The company has recruited the 39-year-old Croydon born model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’, or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out for something different’ from cheap plastic cases.

Carphone added that the cases will be ‘unique designs’ made out of leather and with charms attached, in her ‘personal style’,

Moss and husband Jamie Hince both sported gold charm necklaces at Glastonbury this weekend, along with his-and-hers black jeans and wellies.

Julian Diment, marketing director, said Moss’s designs are inspired by her ‘favourite things’, adding: ‘She has been integral to the design process, raiding her jewellery box for inspiration on the charms.’

The company declined to disclose any details on how much the cases will cost, or on Moss’s fee.

The collaboration with Carphone Warehouse is more down-to-earth than  the glossy campaigns once associated with Moss.

She  has seen several upmarket contracts go to younger women in recent years, including  perfume advertising for YSL Parisienne and Dior Addict.

A lucrative four year partnership with Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than £3million, ended in 2010.

She no longer acts as the face of Mango, the Spanish clothing chain, with Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, a decade younger, starring in its latest campaign.

Although still a very high earner, Moss’s income appears to have been falling. According to an estimate of her wealth in American business magazine in Forbes last summer, she earned £6.3million in the previous 12 months, compared with £8.9m in 2010/11.

Moss said: ‘My phone’s as much a part of my look as my bag or shoes, and yet there’s so little choice out there.’
