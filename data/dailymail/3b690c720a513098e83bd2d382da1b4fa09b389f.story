A man who was finishing his cup of coffee got more than just a caffeine buzz when he discovered what was lurking in his coffee cup.

Ron Morais of Fredericton in New Brunswick in Canada removed the lid from his McDonald's morning brew to discover a dead mouse laying at the bottom.

'I always take the lid off to get my last sip of coffee. And when I took the lid off, there was a little bit of a surprise in my coffee cup,' he told CBC. 'It was a dead mouse.'

Unwelcome surprise: A dead mouse was found at the bottom of a McDonald's coffee cup in Canada

Yuck: Ron Morais from New Brunswick said the mouse 'left a few presents in his drink'! 

The customer added that it looked as though the mouse had been in the cup for a while and left 'a few little, shall we say, presents' in the drink.

His co-worker, Jennifer LaHaye was with Mr Morais at the time of the shocking discovery. 

''Oh my God, there's a mouse in my coffee,' is what he says. I turn around and look at him,' she told the station. 'The first time I looked, I actually looked and it's real, he's not joking.'

Morais said the idea of drinking an entire cup of coffee with a mouse in it made him feel a little ill.

'I kind of had a little queasiness in my stomach,' he said

McDonald's have issued a statement explaining that the local public health company and a pest control company investigated the franchise and found no evidence of a pest problem.

Jason Patuano, the communications manager for the eastern region for McDonald's Canada, issued a corporate statement that underscored how seriously the chain takes food safety.

'We take allegations involving cleanliness and sanitation very seriously,' the statement said.

'Upon learning of this situation, the local franchisee immediately began an investigation, including working closely with the local public health authority who conducted an inspection this [Tuesday] morning following receiving a complaint.'

A Department of Health restaurant inspection record on Tuesday said there was 'no evidence of pests,' and all food items were sealed. The restaurant was not given any warnings in the report.

McDonald's Canada also said a pest control company found no evidence of any rodent issues in the building.

'We are continuing to investigate this isolated incident and have reached out to the customer to obtain the product sample,' the statement said. 

Mr Morais has said he wants to talk to McDonald's officials to understand how the mouse appeared in the coffee.

Incredibly, rather than planning lawsuits over the affair he is happy to joke about it all.

'I mean, hey, you know. I'm here. And I'm in better shape than the mouse,' he said. 

Positive outlook: I'm in better shape than the mouse,' he told CBC
