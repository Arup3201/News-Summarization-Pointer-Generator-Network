Despite the numerous health benefits of condoms, they're often criticised for reducing the level of pleasure felt by men, and women, during sex.

With this in mind, a pair of PHD students has created a digital prototype device that sends short electric impulses along the underside of a condom.

This can increase the amount, and range of sensations, felt during sex - and opens up the technology to be used with other wearable devices and sensors.

A porn studio in Los Angeles has started using software to digitally remove condoms from scenes in post-production.

State law insists scenes are filmed using condoms.

However, this is said to be damaging business; causing permits and viewing numbers to drop dramatically.

Falcon Studios used CGI and airbrushing in their latest production in a bid to appease the law and viewers.

Dubbed Electric Eel, the prototype was created by Firaz Peer and Andrew Quitmeyer from Georgia Tech’s Digital Media Program.

Using their design, Peer and Quitmeyer said they envisage conductive leads being directly embedded into existing condoms by manufacturers, while 'maintaining the soundness and protection that the condoms already provide.'

To test the range of sensations, Peer and Quitmeyer made a soft, 'stimulating sleeve' fitted with conductive arrays of electrodes along the underneath part of the shaft. 

The device is powered by a programmable 
Lilypad microcontroller, which can receive various inputs and commands, 
and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of 
the sleeve.

'This type of device could be hooked up to numerous controllers, directed in person or using existing internet software,' said the designers. 

The device is powered by a Lilypad microcontroller, pictured, which can take in various inputs and commands, and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of the sleeve. The amount of electricity applied is 'very small' although the designers did not specify the exact charge

One example Peer and Quitmeyer tested was connecting the device to a homemade breath sensor.

Users could control the pulses by changing the frequency of breaths and during tests, the device was described as ‘pleasurable, comfortable and exciting.’

In terms of safety, the amount of electricity applied is very small – although the designers did not specify the exact charge - and the designs have all been tested by the makers, personally.

Peer and Quitmeyer have set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund the project and are hoping to raise $10,000 (£6,000) by March 31.
