Support: Conductor Robert King with his wife Viola during his trial over sex offences

When celebrated conductor Robert King was convicted of sexually  abusing choir boys, the court heard his career was ‘devastated’.

Yet just four years after being released from jail, the musical  director and Hollywood film score  producer is back at the top of his profession – and has seemingly been given the Royal seal of approval.

The convicted sex offender is set to headline a concert at an event for Prince Charles’s charity, Music in Country Churches, with his choral group The King’s Consort. The move has caused outrage among concert-goers and child abuse charities.

‘It is as if nothing has happened,’ said Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood. ‘He made these teenagers’ lives a misery – the trauma continues for them. I can’t believe that the Royal family or their charities would have anything to do with him.’

Esther Rantzen, the founder of the child protection charity Childline, said: ‘You have to ask if his crimes have been taken seriously enough.’

King, 53, whose classical albums have sold more than a million copies, was given a three-year, nine-month prison sentence after he was found guilty of 14 charges of indecent assault on five boys, one as young as 12, during the 1980s and 1990s.

A court heard in 2007 that the conductor, who has performed at the BBC Proms eight times, had used his ‘god-like’ status to ply the young musicians and choirboys with alcohol and then indecently assault them.

He has always denied any wrong-doing and accused his victims of being ‘absolute’ liars and ‘looneys’.

King’s wife Viola, 34, supported him throughout the trial, following which the father of one was placed on the sex offenders register.

He was not banned from working with children and has since re-established The King’s Consort group, which recently toured and released a best-selling album.

Embarrassing: The concert in aid of Music in Country Churches, which has Prince Charles as its patron

The group has been booked to headline the ‘spectacular musical pageant’ in the village of Long Melford, Suffolk, on August 31, in aid of Music in Country Churches –  which has Prince Charles as its patron.

The charity was set up in 1989, with the ‘active support of the Prince of Wales’, who is quoted on its website and has attended more than 40 of its concerts.

It organises musical events in the countryside with the revenues used to restore local churches, in this case the village’s medieval Holy Trinity church.

One parishioner, who did not wish to be named, said she was ‘shocked’ about King’s background.

‘I had absolutely no idea. You wouldn’t want Gary Glitter playing at your church, would you?’Mark Bridges, the Royal solicitor and chairman of the charity, said: ‘I am obviously aware of the verdict of the court and that he has served his time and having done that, has come to back to society.

‘Our objective as a charity is to provide financial support to churches by providing world-class performances by musicians and he is by anyone’s standards a world class musician.’

Church spokesman Patrick Kohler said the evening had been organised by the charity. He added: ‘It is a very prestigious organisation and we would find it difficult to say no to them.’
