Andy Murray closed in on his 500th career victory on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over hard-hitting Colombian Santiago Giraldo to make the fourth round of the Miami Open.

The world number four will now meet South African giant Kevin Anderson on Tuesday in an attempt to become the first British player to make the 500-mark since tennis went fully 'open' to all players in 1968.

Now three wins ahead of Tim Henman's career tally, Murray had a mid-morning start against world number 27 Giraldo, who strikes the ball as firmly as anyone from the back of the court.

But Murray's subtle changes of angles and spins unpicked him, and he closed the match out after a mini-scare when the South American pulled him back from 5-1 up in the second set to win in 84 minutes.

'He hits it very hard and made things difficult at the end so it's good to get through,' said Murray, who now takes on the number fifteen seed.
