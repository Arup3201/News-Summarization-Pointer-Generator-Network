Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told MailOnline that 'bags for life' should not be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them

Using a ‘bag for life’ might make you feel virtuous, but it could harm your health, experts are warning.

Shoppers who ditch their plastic bags in favour of reusable ones are putting themselves at risk of food poisoning, they say.

Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told MailOnline that ‘bags-for-life’ should not be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them as the bacteria on these products can then be transferred to other foods, such as fruit, that will be consumed without cooking.

Professor Pennington said: ‘Plastic bags should be used for things like raw meat. They shouldn’t be going into Hessian or cotton bags, even if they are wrapped, because the outside of their packages carry bacteria.

‘Raw meats should be separated from the rest of shopping – particularly from unwrapped things that will be eaten raw.’

He added that plastic, Hessian and cotton reusable bags are equally unsuitable for carrying raw meat but that they are fine for transporting products such as boxes of cereal and jars of jam.

He explained that they can be machine washed to keep them as clean as possible for transporting products other than raw meats.

But, he said that washing them or using antibacterial sprays is not enough to kill the bacteria transferred to them by raw meat.

He told MailOnline: ‘They are really rather difficult to clean. If they are looking a bit grotty then they should be thrown away.

‘You can’t get the bugs out just by washing them – it will get rid of some of the bacteria, but not all of them.

‘Once you’ve used a bag for carrying raw meat, you should throw it away.’

Professor Pennington's comments come after a study by University of Pennsylvania revealed that since San Francisco banned the use of plastic bags in 2007, hospitalisations and deaths from foodborne illnesses have nearly doubled.

Penn Law professor, Jonathan Klick, found that eight per cent of reusable shopping bags contain E.coli and that 97 per cent of people admit to never washing their reusable bags.

Professor Klick said: 'Food safety research has shown that a large percentage of reusable bags actually contain harmful bacteria.'

Professor Pennington says people should never transport raw meat in reusable bags, even it is wrapped.

He says it is also best not to carry vegetables which have soil on them in reusable bags.

He thinks shoppers should throw away any bag that has been used to carry raw meat.

The professor says washing bags that have carried raw meat is not sufficient to make them safe for use.

He also says using antibacterial sprays will not kill all of the bacteria.

However, he says it is fine to use 'bags for life' to carry products such boxes of cereal and jars of jam.

Professor Pennington says bags used for carrying these items can be machine washed when they start to look 'grotty'.
