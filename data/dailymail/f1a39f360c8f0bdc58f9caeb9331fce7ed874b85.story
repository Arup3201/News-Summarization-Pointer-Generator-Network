A woman is suing Boar's Head, the supplier of delicatessen meats, cheeses and condiments, for discriminating against her as a domestic-violence victim. 

Sequeya Henderson, 22, claims she was sacked after the company ignored her repeated complaints that co-worker Jarrett Claitt - her then boyfriend - was abusing her at the company's office in Brooklyn, New York.

According to her Brooklyn federal court suit against Boar's Head and Claitt, he threatened her in the company parking lot and bombarded her with texts and calls.

When she asked him to stop, she alleges that he replied, 'I really feel like putting a bullet in your fat-ass head right now.'

Henderson claims she sent Boar's Head the threat, but they took no action, reports the New York Post.

Claitt was arrested and then fired after he allegedly choked, punched and threatened to kill her in her office, the lawsuit claims.

The next day, he allegedly showed the sex tape off. The company then fired her, saying it was because she had lied about the relationship, Henderson claims.

Claitt got his job back after an arbitrator later found 'no credible evidence' he had assaulted her, according to court papers.

A Boar's Head declined to comment, while a relative of Claitt has denied the allegations.
