There are fresh calls to raise Australia’s drinking age from 18 to 21, with the rate of alcohol-fuelled violence increasing among young Australians.

The Medical Journal of Australia report claims that young people who engage in binge drinking during early adult years are putting themselves at a greater risk of alcohol-induced brain impairment.

Authored by four academics from leading Australian universities, the report cites new evidence that increasing the legal purchasing age of alcohol will reduce instances of youth alcohol-related harm.

Cause for concern: The Medical Journal of Australia have released a new report calling for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21

Citing an increase in alcohol-attributed hospitalisations and the normalisation of binge drinking among Australian youth, the group are calling for the prioritisation of prevention.

Analysing evidence gathered between 1970 and 1975, when the legal drinking age was dropped to 18 in Canada and several Australian states, the report claims that car crashes involving 18 to 20-year-old drivers increased by 10 per cent.

In some cases, the trickle-down effect also meant higher instances of alcohol-related car crashes among 15 to 17 year olds.

Evidence relating to the trickle-down effect shows that people aged a few years below the legal drinking age can easily obtain alcohol from older siblings or friends.

Meanwhile, the positive impact of a drinking age hike can be seen in data that came out of the US when the drinking age was raised across all states.

In 1984, the US government passed legislation to raise the drinking age federally by withholding highway funding to states that would not raise the drinking age to 21.

Once the drinking age was raised, evidence from 17 states found an average reduction of underage crash involvement of 16 per cent.

Similarly, the flow-on effect of the rise meant less people were drinking in adolescence and consequently, developed less harmful drinking patterns as adults.

The report cites a 2010 Schoolies experience questionnaire of youth aged 17 to 19 as evidence of the normalisation of binge drinking culture.

Acknowledging that their hard-line approach may not go down too well with politicians and alcohol companies in Australia, the researchers also propose alternative policy options.

Less challenging options include increasing the drinking age to 19 or 20 years old, so as to remove the legal purchasing of alcohol from high school students.

Another option proposed is limiting the types and amount of alcohol that can be purchased by young people, as in Norway or Sweden.
