London Ambulance Service said the man had been taken 'as a priority' by road to the Royal London Hospital. He was accompanied by a doctor. 

Those in attendance took to Twitter to express their concern. 

Jack Morgan tweeted: 'Definitely did not expect that halfway through a show! Hope that guy is okay.'

A spokesman said: 'We're aware that people are asking why we didn't stop the show, as soon as we realised what had happened medical staff and production security were taking care of him.

'The builder was working on an adjacent building site to the Topshop show space and walked on the corrugated glass roof on top of the space - as to why he walked on it we do not know yet - but the slate of glass gave way.

'He fell in an area to the back of the stage.'

The Ashish show, which set to take place in the venue at 3pm, went ahead as scheduled.
