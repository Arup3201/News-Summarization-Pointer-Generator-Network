Liverpool's new signing Divock Origi has admitted he was surprised by the extent the club had tracked his career.

Origi played and scored at the World Cup for Belgium and completed a £10million move to Anfield last month before being loaned back to Lille.

'Liverpool followed me for a long time,' the striker said in an interview with L'Equipe. 'When I arrived in the offices there, they showed me cassettes of me in the Under 15s. Everyone knew me. I couldn't believe it.

'When I arrived, I was impressed. Steven Gerrard told me it was a shame that I wouldn't be there straight away as everyone was waiting impatiently for me. That means something. I also saw [Daniel] Sturridge, who was very nice.'

Origi will gain valuable experience of playing in Europe's premier competition, the Champions League, if Lille are to progress from the final play-off. They were held to a 1-1 draw by Grasshoppers on Tuesday but went through 3-1 on aggregate.  

Brendan Rodgers also has high expectations. 'He wants me to become one of the best in the world,' Origi added of his new manager.

The 19-year-old striker only made his Ligue 1 debut in February 2013 and has not got carried away with his success so far.

'Last year, I scored on my Ligue 1 debut before dropping out of the team a little later,' said Origi, who has made just 12 starts in 40 French top-flight appearances.

'That pushed me to work harder. I want to play a run of games, establish myself in the team, improve, discover European competition.'

A shame: Steven Gerrard told Origi that everyone at Anfied wanted the youngster at the club now
