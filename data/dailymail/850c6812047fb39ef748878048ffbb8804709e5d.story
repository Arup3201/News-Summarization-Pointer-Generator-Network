Naming a child can be hard enough with so many old and new names going in and out of fashion.

Now a new tool shows how trends in girls' names have swept across the US over the decades.

This fascinating map illustrates how some names will stand the test of time, while others are short-lived trends - here today but gone tomorrow.

Trendy: New mothers and fathers can check out which girls' names are the most popular in their state and across the US with this time-lapse map

The clever tool shows how some names, such as Lisa and Jennifer have stood the test of time and swept across the entire country in popularity

Remarkably, it also illustrates how some parts of the US are the trend-setters, coming up with a new favourite girls' name, which then spread like wildfire across neighbouring states, and sometimes even across the entire United States.

From 1960 until 2012, the most popular girls name in each state are easily identified by the colour, while all other names are monochrome.

Tennessee and Kentucky, in the mid-East, frequently buck the trend. These two states opted for Amanda over Jennifer in the mid-1970s, ending a decade dedicated to a love for the name Jennifer.

Not all names were adopted from East to West, with trends often spanning a cluster of neighbouring states

Jessica, like Jennifer a few years earlier, showed it was a strong girls' name that stood the test of time, clinging on for years in some states, disappearing but then coming back again

They then also adopt Ashley, which spread almost entirely across the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Perhaps one of the traditionalist states is Utah, which began the Jennifer affair in 1969. It went on to be the most popular girls' baby name throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.

The name Madison originates in the West, in Utah, in 1996. It's picked up two years later in neighbouring states before it travels like a plague across the south-east and other pockets for a few years. Madison's eventually pushed out in favour of Emma and Emily.

Ava, Isabella and Sophia are some of the most popular recent baby names today the US.

Sometimes, names were only popular for a short period of time in just one or two states, like Brittany on the East coast

The baby names map was created by Reuben Fischer-Baum, of Deadspin sports news service, using data from the Social Security Administration.

After some trial and errors with colours Mr Fischer-Baum decided it was 'cleaner and more interesting to limit the palette to just the most popular name for any given year, and put the rest in greyscale so you coud se how the different eras of tops names progressed,' he is quoted in The Atlantic.

The baby naming trend data was made available by one curious father in 1997 who didn't want to name his child a common name.

According to the Boston Globe, Michael Shackleford wrote a simple programme to sort rank popular baby names, as listed on Social Security data, against year and gender. His program gave the results of the most popular boys' and girls' names.

Both the north west and south east regions appear to be trend-setters, often the first states to break away from a traditional name and start a new trend, such as Hannah
