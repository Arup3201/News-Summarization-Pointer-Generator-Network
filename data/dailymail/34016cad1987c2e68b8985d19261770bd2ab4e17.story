Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes says Manchester City fans are failing to offer their team the necessary support on big European nights.

Scholes, who won the Champions League twice with United, said that atmospheres like Old Trafford and Anfield fire their teams up on European nights.

But City's Etihad Stadium doesn't have the same impact, according to the ex-England midfielder.

Paul Scholes was critical of Manchester City fans leaving the stadium almost empty at 7.15 on Tuesday

The former Manchester United star said he thought City fans didn't realise how much the competition means

‘The crowd need to get behind this team they need to create a special European atmosphere,' Scholes told ITV ahead of City's home game with Roma, which was watched by 37,509 fans, nearly 10,000 down on capacity.

‘I was lucky enough to play at Old Trafford and we always talked about the atmosphere on a Tuesday night, the special atmosphere you create, and the crowd is rocking when you go out for a warm up.

‘At quarter past seven and there's empty seats everywhere.

Scholes played in the Champions League throughout his United career and enjoyed the 'special' occassions

‘When you come here it just doesn't have a European night feel to it. You go to Liverpool, you go to Old Trafford, you go to Chelsea, they have a special feeling for it.'

Scholes also suggested that the City fans don't appreciate how fortunate they are to be facing Europe's elite clubs. 

‘Tonight I don't think there is [a special atmosphere]. I don't think they realise what a big game this is.

‘They've got the team, they've definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don't think they do.’

Another Manchester United legend Rio Ferdiand also hit out at City's fans. The former England captain tweeted:  'How many empty seats are there at the City vs Roma game by the way...big CL game & fans would rather Ramsays Kitchen or something at home'.

The QPR defender continued 'Expanding the stadium for what though?? For who though??'
