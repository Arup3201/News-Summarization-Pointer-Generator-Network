The dog adopted and then returned by Governor Rick Scott during the 2010 GOP campaign, had to be given back because he bit an employee at his Florida mansion, it was revealed today.

Scott was slammed last week after it was discovered he only kept the dog - Reagan - for the duration of his gubernatorial campaign, and gave 
the retriever back after he was sworn into office.

But it was revealed today that the governor was forced to send the dog back after he bit a mansion grounds employee on January 7, 2011, three days after he took office.

Adopted: Gov. Rick Scott adopted this Labrador retriever, Reagan, ahead of his GOP nomination in 2010, and gave him back to his previous owner only a year later

Scott posted photos of the dog on his Facebook during the campaign and had constituents name the pooch

Scott
 had adopted the retriever shortly after his GOP nomination two years 
ago. The candidate posted photos of the dog to his Facebook campaign 
website, asking constituents to help name the newest member of his 
family.

Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said: 'The governor and first lady love dogs and they had to make a hard 
decision when it was clear that Reagan was very anxious around lots of 
different people.'

The Scotts have since adopted Tallee, a calmer, gentler seven-year-old yellow Lab.

Mansion grounds employee 
Jennifer Kinsey was arranging flowers in the mansion when Reagan bit her
 on the right hand, according to an incident report made by her 
supervisor for the Department of Management Services.

The injury was not serious and did not need medical treatment, according to The Miami Herald.

Facebook friends chose the name Reagan
 from a list of three choices suggested by the campaign and applauded 
the candidate’s decision to adopt a rescue dog instead of a 
purebred, such as President Obama’s dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog.

However, reporters from the Tampa Bay Times noticed that Reagan had not been seen since Scott’s 2011 inauguration. 

After
 some digging, the reporters realized there were no photos of Reagan 
since before the election. Images of the dog had been removed from 
Scott's gubernatorial campaign website as well.

Bad fit? Gov. Scott said that Reagan would bark 
constantly if anyone was carrying something; he was elected Florida's 
governor in 2010 and sworn in a year later

Ms Sellers said Gov Scott flew Reagan back to Naples on his private jet to the place they adopted him from.

'The family decided that the best decision for the dog and all those who
 visit (the Governor’s Mansion) would be to have the grooming business 
find Reagan a more appropriate home with less people and activity,' 
Sellers said. 'It was a hard choice that sometimes pet owners have to 
make.'

Last Monday, reporters confronted Scott about the case of the vanishing dog. The governor said that Reagan ‘scared the living daylights’ out of everyone living at his Tallahassee mansion and that it wasn’t working out.

The dog, he said, would not stop barking if he saw a person carrying something.

Scott said that because of Reagan’s temperament, he had no choice but to return him to his previous owner.
