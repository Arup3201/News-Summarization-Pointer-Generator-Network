It is one of the most iconic photographs to have ever been taken.

Sitting 800 feet above the crowded Manhattan streets, a weary group of steel workers enjoy their lunch perched on a beam.

But now, more than 80 years on, a new group of workers have decided to recreate that stunning image.

This hardy group of workmen from Alton 
Towers decided to celebrate the completion of new Â£18million white-knuckle ride The
 Smiler by enjoying their lunch on top of the ride.

Back in time: Workmen from Alton Towers celebrated the completion of new white-knuckle ride The Smiler. They created a modern-day version of the famous 1932 image in which steel workers enjoyed their lunch perched on a beam

Famous: These steel workers helped to recreate one of the most iconic photographs ever taken when they sat on a beam 800-feet up on the RCA building in Rockefeller Center. The workmen at Alton Towers have recreated this image

It is an almost identical recreation of the famous image taken on September 20, 1932, when a group of steel workers enjoyed their lunch on the 70-story RCA building on New York's Rockefeller Centre. At the time, it was the largest building in terms of office space in the world.

The new roller coaster at the popular theme park promises to terrorise thrill-seekers in a whole new
 way after it was designed with the help of psychology experts and 
scientific researchers.

With plunging drops of up to 98ft and maximum speeds of 53mph, Smiler is set to terrify those who use it.

But it is the roller coaster's psychological effects that are set to 
push thrill-seekers to their limits, and the designers promise to 'blur 
the line between illusion and reality'.

Katherine Duckworth, one of the team who came up with the concept for the new ride at Alton Towers, said: 'This ride will put not just your body but also your mind through its paces.

Finished: The workmen are pictured at the top of the new white-knuckle ride which its designers claim will terrorise thrill-seekers in a whole new way

Exciting: Alton Towers' Smiler opens in May, with plunging drops of up to 98ft and maximum speeds of 53mph

'We want people to get off the ride and not know what is real.

'There are five different mind effects, which are all designed to mess with your head. You shoot towards giant syringes, spinning hypnotic wheels, and flashing lights, among other things.'

These props are more than just background scenery. Each is a psychological trigger, set to keep the passengers on edge by disorientating and misleading them.

The ride blasts towards huge needles and what looks like a drive-through car wash but, of course, the threat they present is only in the mind.

Researchers from New Scientist magazine were involved in Smiler's design. They found anticipation is a key factor in ensuring a thrill and that they worked best when presented as stories or narratives.

As such, Smiler even comes with its own back-story - that it was created by the Ministry Of Joy, a secretive organisation that has been conducting top secret experiments on mankind for years.

Smiler opens to the public in May.
