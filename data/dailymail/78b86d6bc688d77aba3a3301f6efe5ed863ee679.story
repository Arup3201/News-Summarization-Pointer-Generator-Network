Christina Lagogiannis, 12, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in January 2014

The family of a 12-year-old girl who has undergone eight surgeries in the last 12 months to treat an aggressive bone cancer has raised over $100,000 to help get her to Germany for life changing treatment.

Christina Lagogiannis, from East Bentley in Melbourne, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in January of last year. 

She endured more than six months of chemotherapy and a string of operations before being told that her cancer has progressed to stage four.

'The worst part is when your own child comes up to you and says: "am I going to die, mum?",' Christina's mother, Nayree Lagogiannis, told Daily Mail Australia.

'She had already Googled everything, let me tell you, but I said "I will promise you that I will do everything in my power to help you get better and I will not let you die".'

Mrs Lagogiannis watched as her daughter took on a full knee and femur replacement, further surgery on her knee due to infection, a biopsy and then keyhole surgery on her right lung followed by three more open surgeries on her lungs to remove a number of lesions.

The 40-year-old mother-of-three said she was furious at the lack of options provided by the Australian healthcare system for her daughter's ongoing treatment -- comprising more chemotherapy and more surgeries.

'They are offering her chemotherapy with no percentage rate of remission or survival,' Mrs Lagogiannis said.

'I'm not going to let them guinea pig her. I don't need that. She's not going to have any more of that poison running through her veins. 

'Each time they go in they have to take out a piece of her lung, and then there's only so much of the lung they can remove and that's when they will put her on palliative care. I'm not going to let that be the last alternative.

Christina will be treated at the Medical Centre in Cologne in Germany where she will receive hypothermia and dendritic cell vaccinations - both of which are unavailable in Australia 

'I am very frustrated. There is so much funding for things like breast cancer, but the smaller cancers and less common things that have also been around for many, many years - the treatment hasn't changed for more than 30 years.'

It was her promise to her daughter that led Mrs Lagogiannis to research treatment options available in Germany.

She came across the Medical Centre in Cologne which offers hypothermia and dendritic cell vaccinations, both of which are not available in Australia, and promises a '95 per cent chance that she would either go into full remission or 50 per cent remission,' Mrs Lagogiannis said.

Christina's family said they have been left completely overwhelmed by all the support they have received from their community which has led them to raise $100,000

After raising over $100,000 through their My Cause page and by running a number of local fundraisers, Christina has been given the opportunity to travel to Germany with her family where she will receive the $80,000 treatment over the next eight weeks.

Christina's family said they have been left completely overwhelmed by all the support they have received from their community.

'She's one tough cookie let me tell you and she makes everyone else around her stronger too because of her strength,' Mrs Lagogiannis said of her brave daughter.

'She's full steam ahead, saying "I just want to be healthy and live my life". That's all we want.'
