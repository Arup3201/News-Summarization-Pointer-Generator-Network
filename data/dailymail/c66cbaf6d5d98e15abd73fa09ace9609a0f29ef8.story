A woman dubbed 'rat girl' has single-handedly launched an infestation of San Francisco after releasing thousands of rodents on to the streets of the city.

The woman - known only as 43-year-old Erica J - has reportedly been breeding and releasing the vermin into the area for years.

She was first found releasing hundreds of rats into the streets around a hotel in the South of Market neighbourhood, in 2011.

SFGate reports that public health officials had exterminated thousands of the creatures, from the surrounding area by the end of May.

Later, Animal Care and Control found the 'troubled woman' living under a pedestrian bridge in Japantown.

KTVU reported that the rats were living off a cart that the woman had with her.

San Franciscan authorities said they are now at a loss as to what to do about Erica, as they fear there is a serious underlying mental health condition leading to her unusual hobby

Animal Care and Control Capt Denise BonGiovanni said that the situation is probably going to continue wherever she lives until she gets the help that she needs

Erica was then later spotted with at least eight rats in a park at Golden Gate Avenue and Steiner Street, where the rats were apparently seen eating dog food out of a bowl.

San Franciscan authorities said they are now at a loss as to what to do about Erica, as they fear there is a serious underlying mental health condition leading to her unusual hobby.

Animal Care and Control Capt. Denise BonGiovanni told the television station: 'We understand that Erica has housing again in the city and I can only imagine that this situation is probably going to continue wherever she lives until she gets the help that she needs.'
