The date of the earliest settlement of South Asians in Britain is not known for certain.

It could be as long ago as the Middle Ages when the Roma and Sinti - both believed to have originated in parts of north India and Pakistan - began migrating west.

But it was the formation of the East India Company in 1600, which saw the birth of a complex relationship between Britain and India.

For many the 1950s marks the beginning 
of their family's lives in Britain, as economic migrants came to counter
the postwar labour shortage in steel mills in the north and factories 
in the south.

Asian Britain charts an untold history through 286 black and white photographs

The Asian contribution to Britain's 
diverse culture is so often pigeon-holed into two distinct categories: 
food and fashion, saris and samosas.

But
a breathtaking new book, bringing together 286 black and white 
photographs, sets out to chart a fascinating and important untold social
history.

Susheila
Nasta's anthology reveals Tory Asians marching on the campaign trial in
Finchley with Margaret Thatcher in 1983, a group of Indian soldiers 
entertaining passers by with traditional music and dance during their 
lunch hour in London in 1940 and Peter Singh, the only Sikh Elvis 
impersonator having tea with his wife and daughter.

The
book gives a glimpse of some of the first documented Asian migrants, of
which less is known than their second and third generation relatives.

It draws on culture, music, 
dance, film, the military, business, the suffragist movement and the 
different phases of settlement of Asian migrants from the subcontinent, 
the Carribean and east Africa.

It
features the first female law student at Oxford, Cornelia Sorabji 
pictured making a radio broadcast in London in the early 1930s.

She
shares the pages with the first Asian MP Liberal Dadabhai Naoroji, who 
served as as member of the Government from 1892 to 1895 and the first 
Indian RAF pilots.

But their portraits are given equal weight to those of hundreds of ordinary

immigrants and their families.

The preface written by Razia Iqbal, says: 'From the first trade conducted between 
the two nations along the Silk Route to the adoption of Chicken Tikka 
Masala as a national dish, the ongoing mutual exchange of cultures 
continues to flourish today.

'Asian Britain vividly charts Britain’s 
process of coming to terms with the historic realities of its culturally
diverse past and present.'

The East India Company, through trade, conquest and colonisation helped transform the culture and history of both Britain and India.

The force of the Company, combined with Britain's long imperial rule in India was the catalyst for far reaching changes and a steady migration of Asians from all walks of life west, to set up home in the UK.

Following the 1857 Indian Uprising, the Company was abolished and the British Crown took direct control of the Indian Government. That control and the period of the British Raj lasted nearly a century.

The 17th Century saw a rise in migration of Asians to Britain. Servants and ayahs, Asian nannies, were brought back by British families returning home after spending time in the British ruled country.

Ayahs were often left stranded as families failed to honour the promise of a ticket home.

Indian sailors, known as lascars, crewed ships and steam-powered liners to and from the subcontinent. The harsh working conditions and poor pay lead to many lascars jumping ship to settle in British ports. They became the earliest Asian working class group in the country.

And the lascars took up arms and fought alongside British forces in World War One and Two.

Meanwhile intellectuals, politicians and activists campaigned in Britain for Indian independence, equality and social justice.

The coming of steam-powered liners, and the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean and Red Sea, reduced the journey times between both countries.

One enterprising Asian, featured in the 
book, is Sake Dean Mahomed. Having served in the East India Company's 
Bengal Regiment, he settled in Ireland in 1784. In 1810 he opened the 
first Asian restaurant run by an Asian, the Hindoostanee Coffee House in
London.

When that venture failed, he moved to Brighton in 1814. There he set up Mahomed's Baths, offering treatments, massage, steamed baths of aromatic Indian herbs and oils to people suffering muscular ailments.

It's success made Mahomed famous and people flocked to the baths, with many doctors recommending patients visit. In 1822, King George IV gave him the official role of the King's personal shampooing surgeon, a role extended during William IV's reign.

In the aftermath of World War One a new group of working-class Asians arrived in Britain, often working as pedlars while living in poor areas with run-down housing.

These early settlers established places of worships, and formed the basis of the first Asian communities with vibrant clubs, societies and shops.
