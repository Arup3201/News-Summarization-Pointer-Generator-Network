Prince Andrew’s chances of appearing in a US court over ‘sex slave’ allegations receded last night, after authorities mounted a legal challenge against the woman who claims she slept with him.

Prosecutors have asked a judge in Florida to reject Virginia Roberts’s plea to join a seven-year legal battle being waged by two other women. 

They are suing the US Government over the lenient treatment of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, jailed for 18 months in 2008.

Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. The chances of the Prince having to appear in court over her allegation she was forced to sleep with him look to be receding

The women, identified as ‘Jane Does 1 and 2’, claim their rights as victims were breached when they were not consulted over a controversial deal signed by prosecutors with billionaire Epstein, which granted him and others immunity from prosecution over dozens of cases of underage sexual abuse.

In return, Epstein, 62, a former friend of the Prince, pledged to pay compensation to his victims.

In the new filing at Palm Beach County Court, prosecutors say Roberts was happy to receive an out-of-court settlement from Epstein, knowing the non-prosecution agreement had been signed. 

If the US authorities win the case, Andrew will be spared having to give evidence or make a witness statement. It will also mean Roberts, 32 will no longer be able to repeat any of her claims without fear of being sued.

Legal experts said prosecutors had a strong case and believe it is likely a judge will side with them. US lawyer Charles Hayes said: ‘The government just have to prove Roberts was aware of the [immunity] agreement and a judge will favour them. 

Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave'

'There has to be a very good reason to allow another party to join a long-running legal action and I don’t see one here.’

The Prince was named in papers filed by Roberts earlier this year. She identified him as one of the men she was forced to sleep with while being kept as a ‘sex slave’ by Epstein.

She also claimed that Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, and Epstein’s girlfriend, recruited her into the financier’s employment as a ‘masseuse’.

Roberts said she was ‘loaned’ to Epstein’s wealthy friends after being groomed over a number of years by him. Roberts claimed she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, including taking part in an orgy on Epstein’s private Caribbean island.

Andrew has strenuously denied any sexual relationship with Roberts, who was 17 when they met. Ms Maxwell has also denied any wrongdoing. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
