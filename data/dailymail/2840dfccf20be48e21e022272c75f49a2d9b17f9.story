The eight-year-old son of the AirAsia QZ8501 captain is unaware his father’s plane has crashed and believes his ‘daddy is still at work’, relatives have said.

Captain Iriyanto, an experienced former military jet pilot, crashed in airspace thick with storm clouds between Indonesia and Singapore while piloting the Airbus with 162 people on board on Sunday.

The pilot’s brother Budi Sutiono told the Telegraph Iriyanto’s son Arya Galih Gegara has been told his father is still at work.

‘He keeps asking us and he keeps crying because he misses his father,’ Mr Sutino said.

The family have switched all the televisions in the house off and will break the news to eight-year-old Galih gradually.

‘Slowly we will try to explain what has happened to his father. But it needs time,’ he added.

Captain Iriyanto’s daughter made an emotional plea for her father to come home when news of the plane’s disappearance first broke, telling him: 'I still need you'. 

His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.' 

Cpt Iriyanto's father said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week. 

Suwarto, who has only one name, told the BBC he hoped he would see his son again, but accepted it would be God's will if he didn't. 

The pilot's devastated wife Widiya Sukati Putri told Bloomberg News on Tuesday he always prioritised his family when not flying. 

'When I see the kids, I must be strong,' she said.

Captain Iriyanto was an Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before taking early retirement to become a commercial airline pilot

At Iriyanto's house in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, neighbours, relatives and friends gathered to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family. 

Their desperate cries were so loud, they could sometimes be heard outside where three LCD televisions had been set up to monitor search developments. 

'He is a good man. That's why people here appointed him as our neighbourhood chief for the last two years,' said Bagianto Djoyonegoro, a friend and neighbour, adding that despite being busy with his job, Iriyanto was always very active in the community and attentive to the needs of the people around him. 

Cpt Iriyanto's nephew told Indonesian news outlet Detik.com his uncle, who is married with two young children, was 'a very caring person'.

When out of the cockpit Iriyanto spent time with his family, his wife Widiya Sukati Putri said in tears

He said: 'He is always helping people because he is a very caring person. If there is a sick relative who needed help and even money, my uncle would be there. 

'If there are money problems in the family, he would surely help.' Many recalled him as an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before taking early retirement to become a commercial airline pilot. 

Cpt Iriyanto was 'was one of the best graduates' at the military academy, the Adi Sucipto Air Force pilot school, in 1983, former coordinating political, legal and security affairs minister Djoko Suyanto told the Jakarta Post.

'Iriyanto was known as one of the 'Flight Leaders' on F-5 Tigers, the leading fighter jet in the 1980s,' said Yadi, who once served with Iriyanto in the 14th squadron. AirAsia said the captain had more than 20,000 flying hours, of which 6,100 were with AirAisa on the Airbus 320.
