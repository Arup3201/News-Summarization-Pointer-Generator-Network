Prince Harry will fire a live missile for the first time when he arrives in the U.S. this week to take part in an intense eight-week training programme in one of the world's most awesome fighting machines.

The 27-year-old royal will take the controls of an Apache helicopter in a mega-shooting range at Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in Imperial Valley in the Californian desert.

He is already qualified to fly the aircraft after passing earlier this year but in order for him to be 'battle ready' he now has to complete a 'Conversion to Role' course and could face battle as early as next year.

A spokesman for St James's Palace said: 'The training in the USA will consist of environmental training, live
firing and tactical exercises.'

Prince Harry will be in for a shock when he arrives at Gila Bend. It is a dusty one-road town that boasts a population of just 1,700 and 'five old crabs' - and has just one bar.

After two lavish summer holidays - in Hvar, Croatia, and at a luxury villa in Majorca - Harry's forthcoming trip promises to be slightly more demanding.

He will stay at the remote location as part of a 12-week RAF Apache helicopter training course, following a short time in El Centro, California, where he will arrive in the first week of October.

Gila Bend has been chosen by military chiefs because its environment is similar to Afghanistan.

The U.S. Air Force Base is 
basic with just one runway, an air-traffic control tower, a few tents 
and a couple of building and is surrounded by giant cacti.

Facilities are so sparse that most RAF pilots visiting on the course - Exercise Crimson Eagle - stay in the adjacent town.

While Harry is used to staying aboard yachts and in some of the world's most luxurious hotels, Gila Bend's top lodgings costs just £60 per night.

The Space Age Lodge - a Best Western - has bizarrely been designed to look like a space ship.

Two horse town? Local Cowboy Terrell Farnsworth hasn't even heard of Prince 'Henry'

During his stay in Croatia last month, Harry was photographed jumping fully-clothed into a swimming pool surrounded by fellow party-goers dancing to thumping music.

But Gila Bend has only one small pool at the quirky Space Age Lodge.

A receptionist said: 'Visitors who are not staying at the hotel can use the pool for $2.50 (£1.60). Harry will be welcome to come if he wants.'

And it seems Harry, who is used to being recognised wherever he goes, might get a different reception in Gila Bend, where many residents are clueless as to his identity.

Local cowboy Terrell Farnsworth, 49, said: 'I have no idea who Prince Henry is. I've never heard of him.'

He joked: "The girls are going to go crazy if there's a prince coming here. All five of them.

'The town is very small. They built a freeway around it a few years back and it killed the town. Now people just drive around it when they used to go through it and stop off.'

Should the single prince be looking for an American bride in Gila Bend, then it seems his options will also be limited.

Brigette Mowry, 45, the bartender at Gila Bend's only bar, Netos, said: 'There's nothing really here so most of the young women move away as soon as they can.

'The women here are usually a bit older and already married. Most of the people who live here are retired.

'Sometimes the British pilots come in here and play pool or have a beer.

'We occasionally have karaoke and live music here and that's when the few girls of the town come in.

'If we put on a karaoke night here that'll be his only chance of meeting any of them.'

Local tourist sights are also limited - a small, one-room museum displays old Native American antiques found in the area.

Day-trips include the Butterfield Pass Trail - an historic hiking path Mormons moving to the West Coast once used.

Nearby are some native American rock carvings created by old tribes who lived in the area.

Harry could also head down to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument - a national park forest of huge cacti.

The course at Gila Bend is the culmination of Harry's 
training in flying Apache helicopter gunships, which he has been doing 
back home at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk.

Following the U.S. leg of his 
training, Harry - known as Captain Wales in the Army Air Corps - will 
return to Britain where he take part in final exercises before any 
possible deployment.
