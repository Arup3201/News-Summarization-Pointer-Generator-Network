Alleged culprit: Genesis Hernandez is believed to be one of the two people behind the faked reports of offensive and racist graffiti on Vassar's campus

A string of offensive graffiti messages were made by a transgender student who was a member of a campus group that dealt bias incidents, according to Vassar College officials.

One of the two known culprits was revealed as Genesis Hernandez, a transgender student in charge of the Bias Incident Response Team, and officials said that the offending pair were the ones behind some of the graffiti.

The school's director of media relations told MailOnline that they have only been able to pinpoint two of the six incidents to the pair, and the investigation into the other incidents is ongoing.

The pair are being held responsible to creating those two graffiti and then reporting the offensive messages to college authorities, pretending like they were not involved in their creation.

Some of the messages- though it is unclear whether they were the ones attributed to the guilty pair or not- included offensive sentiments such as 'Hey Tranny. Know Your Place' and 'Avoid Being B****es'.

Another message found on a student's door was 'F*** N*****', showing that gender identity was not the only bias issue being addressed by the culprit.

Vassar sent out an email to students 
on November 14 telling them that the school's Bias Incident Response 
Team had been told of at least six different messages that were spray 
painted on dorm room doors across campus.

Disturbing the peace: Vassar College, in upstate New York, became concerned when six alleged instances of bias graffiti were reported, only to learn later that they were staged by the group reporting them

Adding up: The school did not formally name Genesis Hernandez as one of the individuals behind the scheme, but the transgender student dropped out of school and left his prominent positions in student government the same day

The student-led group was designed to formulate the reports and provide support for the victims.

Jeff Kosmacher, Vassar director of media relations, told MailOnline the the BIRT is 'a group that gathers and discusses incidents and how the college addresses bias.'

The
 Daily Caller reports that five days after the initial email was sent, 
the school president had to send out another saying that the bias 
incidents were perpetrated by two students, one of whom was a leader of 
BIRT and actively involved in student government.

'It is our unfortunate duty to report that two Vassar students have admitted responsibility for creating a number of recent bias and hate-speech messages in public spaces on campus,' Vassar president Catharine Hill wrote in the email.

'They also falsely reported these as anonymous messages. Sadly, our community has been deeply hurt by these actions.'Â 

Neither of the students' names were listed in the email and it said that they both had left the school voluntarily.

Connected: Hernandez, a junior at the school, was a member of the Bias Incident Response Team and allegedly made up the reports of graffiti disparaging African Americans and transgender students

'Evidence
 showed that two students who were responsible for some of the incidents
 but... we do not know if they were responsible for all of them,' Mr 
Kosmacher said.

He said that criminal charges against the pair are 'not in our plans at this time'.

One
 of the individuals involved remains a mystery, but because of the 
others involvement in campus groups, the second has since been reported
 to be Genesis Hernandez.

Hernandez was a junior at the school and the vice president of student affairs of the Vassar Student Association, which acts as the student government.

He was a leader in a number of gay and lesbian support groups on campus and is featured in a video, uploaded to Youtube by Vassar, at an equality rally.

While the school's only formal statement on about the suspects was the initial email where they were not named, another clue about Hernandez's involvement came when the president of the Vassar's student government sent out an email announcing the vacated position of vice president.
