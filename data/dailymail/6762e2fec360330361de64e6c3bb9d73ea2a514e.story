Feeling hungry inside an airport rarely has a happy ending. The choice tends to be between a soggy sandwich or a soggy sandwich. If you leave it until the flight to sate your appetite you might be rewarded with an even soggier sandwich.

But it doesn't have to be like that. Recent years have seen the growth of a stellar line up of dining options at concourses around the world as chefs wake up to the opportunity of a captive customer with time to kill, a rumbling stomach and money to burn.

To prove the point Condé Nast Traveler - for the first time - has compiled a list recognising some of the best airport restaurants and dishes from around the world for their October 2014 issue. 

Surf and turf: Palm Bar & Grille at John F. Kennedy airport in New York where you can also order a Bozzi burger with aged Gouda and crispy fried onions

Rick Bayless' Tortas Frontera at Chicago's O'Hare airport particularly stood out  for its salads, short rib tortas, smoked pork mollete and margaritas

To judge it they recruited Michelin star and renowned chefs including Daniel Boulud, Grant Achatz, Richard Blais and Jamie Bissonnette.

Their gourmet list covers everything from roast duck noodles to oysters, caviar, margaritas, bloody Marys and sushi  in airport restaurants and takeaways from London to New York and Singapore to Dubai.

Not one but three venues were chosen from London's Heathrow terminals. The panel of foodies commended Carluccio's for its 'wonderful' eggs and coffee, Gordon Ramsay's Plane Food for its butter chicken curry with fried chickpea rice and Caviar House & Prunier Seafood Bar for serving delectable caviar and champagne.

However, the airport with the largest number of eateries included is San Francisco, which had five restaurants in the list.

In Tokyo's International Airport Sushi Kyotatsu's the fish is 'superb', there's a fantastic view of planes taking off and  queues down the corridor to order

First class: three venues were picked out from London's Heathrow terminals including Caviar House & Prunier which serves caviar, salmon and champagne

Venice: if you travel through Marco Polo Airport,  Rustichelli & Mangione's mozzarella pomodoro pane tostato and pizzas cannot be beaten

The Traveler judges agreed that Rick Bayless' Tortas Frontera at Chicago O'Hare particularly stood out from the rest.

Chef Michael Chernow said it has 'the best airport food I've had to date,' and chef Anita Lo added it 'is one of the few that actually deliver and live up to the chef's name.' Pick off braised short rib tortas, smoked pork mollete and margaritas from their menu when you visit.

Order the Bozzi burger with aged Gouda, smoky barbecue sauce, and crispy fried onions from Palm Bar & Grille if you find yourself in John F. Kennedy airport in New York, according to Marc Murphy, chef at N.Y.C.'s Landmarc.

Fish Fridays? Legal Sea Foods in Boston Logan has a long bar table and Chef Jamie Bissonnette recommend arriving early for breakfast

In the Traveler listings Jamie Bissonnette suggests Legal Sea Foods in Boston for breakfast and a Bloody Mary, although their seafood is hugely popular

Chef Jamie Bissonnette suggests Legal Sea Foods in Boston Logan for breakfast and a Bloody Mary, although the seafood options are popular too.

In Tokyo's International Airport Sushi Kyotatsu's, according to Chris Cosentino, chef at Boccalone and Porcellino in San Francisco, 'The quality of the fish was beyond superb, and you have a fantastic view of the planes taking off. It's a perfect farewell to Japan.' The restaurant has queues formed down the corridor for a table or takeaway.

Elsewhere - according to Traveler - at Venice's Marco Polo Airport in Rustichelli & Mangione the mozzarella pomodoro pane tostato is divine, Cádiz Tapas in Dubai is a great place to wind down with a glass of wine and, if you are looking for pizza, nothing beats Metro Pizza in Las Vegas's McCarran terminal. 

Metro is Jon Gray's, vice president of Linq in Las Vegas, go-to venue for a slice of pepperoni pizza before long haul trips. 

Are you sitting comfortably? Cádiz Tapas in Dubai is in terminal 3 near gate B26 and is a great place to wind down with a glass of wine

Tapas time: Cádiz Tapas in Dubai International airport was picked out for its  Spanish themed small plates and South American wines
