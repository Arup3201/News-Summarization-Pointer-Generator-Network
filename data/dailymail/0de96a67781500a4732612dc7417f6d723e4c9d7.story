Apple has avoided paying billions in income tax by using dummy headquarters abroad, according to a damaging U.S. Senate report, but Ireland has today denied it is to blame.

An investigation by a Senate committee 
said the tech giant sought the 'Holy Grail of tax avoidance' schemes by not declaring tax residency in any country.

Irish deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore today said it was not to blame for Apple Inc's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the company.

The denial comes after the Senate 
said Apple paid little or no tax on tens of billions of dollars stashed 
in Irish subsidiaries.

Senate investigation found Apple uses affiliate companies in Ireland (pictured) to avoid billions in U.S. income tax

The report, published yesterday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations yesterday, found that Apple holds $102billion of its $145billion in cash.

An Irish subsidiary that earned $22billion in 2011 paid only $10million in taxes.

The Irish government, which has seen 
the luring of U.S. multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its 
economic policy since the 1960s, said its system was transparent and 
other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by Apple was too 
low.

He told national broadcaster RTE: 
'They are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other 
jurisdictions, and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of 
all in those jurisdictions.'

The Senate subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax residency either in Ireland, where they are incorporated, or in the United States, where those companies are managed.

The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years, the report said.

The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'.

‘Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting 
its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ Sen. Carl Levin, 
D-Mich., the subcommittee's chairman, said.

‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of 
tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions
of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’

The subcommittee's report estimates that
Apple avoided at least $3.5billion in U.S. federal taxes in 2011 and 
$9 billion in 2012.

Apple uses five affiliate companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, according to the report.

The companies are located at the same address in Cork, Ireland, and they share members of their boards of directors.

While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country.

That
means the other three are not legally required to pay taxes in Ireland 
because they are not managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's 
view.

The report says Apple capitalizes on a difference between U.S. and Irish rules regarding tax residency.

In Ireland, a company must be 
managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident. Under U.S. 
law, a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was 
established.

Therefore, the Apple companies are not tax residents of Ireland nor of the U.S., since they were not incorporated in the U.S.

The company, based in 
Cupertino, California, paid $2.5billion in federal taxes in 2011 and $6billion in 2012.

The strategies Apple uses are legal, and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying U.S. income taxes on profits they reap overseas.

However, the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the U.S. tax code, lawmakers say.

The spotlight on Apple's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in Washington over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit.

Many Democrats complain that the government is missing out on collecting billions because companies are stashing profits abroad and avoiding taxes.

Republicans want to cut the corporate
tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. 
companies make abroad. They say the move would encourage companies to 
invest at home.

Apple
CEO Tim Cook, the company's chief financial officer and its tax chief 
are scheduled to testify and explain the company's tax strategy at a 
hearing by the subcommittee today.

The
company refuted the subcommittee's assertions in testimony prepared for
the hearing and released to the public yesterday evening.

Apple
said it employs tens of thousands of Americans and pays ‘an 
extraordinary amount’ in U.S. taxes, citing the roughly $6billion it 
paid in fiscal 2012.

Apple 
‘complies fully with both the laws and the spirit of the laws,’ the 
testimony says. ‘And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this 
country and abroad. Apple does not use tax gimmicks.'

The
company insisted that it does not, as the subcommittee asserts, move 
its intellectual property rights into offshore tax havens and use it to 
sell products back into the U.S. to avoid taxes.

The
company has made clear that given current U.S. tax rates, it has no 
intention of repatriating its overseas profits to the U.S.

Apple reiterated in its testimony its
support for comprehensive tax reform as a way to support economic 
growth and boost U.S. companies' competitiveness.

The subcommittee also has examined 
the tax strategies of Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and other 
multinational companies, finding that they too have avoided billions in 
U.S. taxes by shifting profits offshore and exploiting weak, ambiguous 
sections of the tax code.

Microsoft has used ‘aggressive’ 
transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland and
Singapore, in part to avoid taxes.

HP has used complex offshore loan 
transactions worth billions while using the money to run its U.S. 
operations, according to the panel.

The subcommittee's inquiry and 
hearing are intended to shine a light on ‘offshore tax-avoidance 
tactics’ by Apple, Levin said at a news conference Monday with Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, the panel's senior Republican.

Companies' use of such loopholes has 
the effect of raising the taxes of ordinary Americans and increasing the
federal deficit, he said.

McCain said that while Apple claims 
to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also ‘among America's 
largest tax avoiders.’

He 
called Apple's strategy ‘an egregious and really outrageous scheme that 
Apple has been able to orchestrate to avoid paying taxes.’

The subcommittee report also noted that Apple has been setting aside billions for tax bills it may never pay.

As previously reported by The 
Associated Press, the overlooked asset that Apple has been building up 
could boost Apple's profits by as much as $10.5billion. However, Apple 
has been lobbying to change U.S. law so it can erase its tax liabilities
in a less conspicuous fashion.

In its second quarter ended March 31,
Apple posted its first profit decline in ten years. Net income was 
$9.5billion, or $10.09 a share, down 18 per cent from $11.6billion, or 
$12.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 11 per 
cent, to $43.6billion.

Apple said in April that it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015.

The company is expanding its share 
buyback program to $60billion, the largest buyback authorization in 
history, and is raising its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent, to $3.05 a
share.

In Monday's regular trading session, Apple's stock rose $9.67, or 2.23 per cent, to close at $442.93.

President
Barack Obama has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to 
move jobs back to the U.S. and discourage them from shifting jobs 
abroad.

Amazon is one of the multinationals that have been criticized over its tax affairs

Apple is the latest multinational to be hit by tax avoidance accusations. 

Investigations are currently underway in both the U.S. and UK into corporations who have a turnover of billions but pay a fraction of that in taxes. 

In the UK, Google was accused of doing evil' by a Parliamentary committee after MPs claimed the internet giant by using 'devious, calculated and unethical' trucks to minimize its liabilities. 

It paid just £7.3million in corporation tax last year despite having a UK turnover of £3billion. 

Elsewhere, Amazon could be investigated by the UK Public Accounts Committee after paying just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year. 

But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than £4billion.

Starbucks was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year. 

It has since agreed to pay £20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009.

France has also said it will fight tax avoidance and President Francois Hollande has called for the 'eradication' of tax havens. 

He told French banks last month that they must declare any foreign subsidiaries each year as he presented a draft law drawn up in response to the country's recent tax scandal.
