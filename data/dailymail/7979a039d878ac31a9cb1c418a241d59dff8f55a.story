Brendan Rodgers has predicted Liverpool will benefit from Harry Kane’s spectacular rise — as it will spur Daniel Sturridge on to cement himself as England’s No 1 striker.

The biggest game in the Barclays Premier League this week takes place at Anfield tonight, with man-of- the-moment Kane and Tottenham’s rapidly improving side looking to derail Liverpool’s hopes of clambering back into the top four.

Rodgers, a keen admirer of Kane, believes it is a question of when, rather than if, he gets a senior England call-up but he has given the 21-year-old an idea of how much further he has to climb by labelling Sturridge the best English forward in the business.

After Sturridge’s three appearances off the bench in a week, Rodgers is considering whether his striker is fit enough to start.

The 25-year-old has had to watch as a number of players have staked their claim for inclusion in Roy Hodgson’s squad for next month’s games against Lithuania and Italy.

However, Liverpool boss Rodgers does not feel any of those players have shown they are ready to match the standards Sturridge (right) has set in his career at Anfield.

‘I’m sure Daniel is happy there’s another English striker there,’ said Rodgers. ‘If Harry Kane’s going to be of the level to go on and play for England — which I believe he is — that helps Daniel and the other Liverpool players who play for England because it means you get another top-quality striker. But, for me, there is not anyone better than Daniel Sturridge.

‘He’s got everything in his game if he’s playing consistently. His goalscoring record, his pace, his power — he’s got everything and as an English striker there’s no-one better than him.

‘I’m sure Daniel will look at it that there’s another young English striker coming through and that will really help him when they come together at international level. When Daniel is on the field he gives the opponents’ defence a real problem but also he’s a natural goalscorer.’

Liverpool have carefully managed Sturridge’s rehabilitation and while the stakes against Tottenham are high, he will only start if Rodgers is satisfied he can stand the strain.

‘He has got a big, big talent,’ said Rodgers. ‘He’s going to have to try and work his way back to fitness in games as there’s so little time in between games to train.’

Rodgers’s preparations for the clash with Tottenham have been hindered by a thigh injury to key midfielder Lucas Leiva, which will keep him out for at least a month. It is a blow for the manager as Liverpool have been unbeaten in the last 11 Premier League games he has started.

That run has helped them get into contention for a Champions League place but, equally, their poor start to the campaign means they have given themselves no margin for error.

Rodgers insists he is under no pressure from Fenway Sports Group, the club’s owners. 

‘We had a good chat after training,’ said Rodgers, referring to a visit to Melwood from John W Henry and Tom Werner. ‘They are on a flying visit for the game. I’ve never been set any targets but they know the type of manager they employed was a manager who wants to succeed.

‘For us, (the top four) is where we want to be and, after not such a good start to the season, we are picking up. We want to continue with the momentum and that’s all we can focus on.’
