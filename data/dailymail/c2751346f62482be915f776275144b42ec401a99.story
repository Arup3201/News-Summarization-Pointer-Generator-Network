Glow-in-the-dark trees could soon be a natural alternative to electric street lighting, according to scientists.

Researchers at the Glowing Plant project from California have transferred the glowing genes seen in fireflies, in to plants to make them glow-in-the-dark. 

The team is now hoping to extend the technique to larger plants and trees, and use them to replace electric lights.

A team of scientists from California has developed bacteria than can make plants glow-in-the dark. They have taken genes from fireflies, glow worms and other bacteria that create naturally-occurring light and added it to household plants. The team is hoping that luminescent trees could replace electric street lighting

The genes used in the Glowing Plant project are taken from glow worms and fireflies that create natural light through what's called bioluminescence. The genes are added to agrobacteria, and this agrobacteria transfers these genes to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark

Luciferase is an enzyme used in bioluminescence.

The name comes from Lucifer.

Lucifer is Latin for lucem ferrem, which means 'light-bearer'.

Fireflies, glow worms and jellyfish can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways. 

The enzyme can also be found in some bacteria and Jack-O-Lantern mushrooms.

Antony Evans from the University of Cambridge, with Stamford PHDs Kyle Taylor and Omri Amirav-Drory have been creating glow-in-the-dark plants in a DIY biolab in California.

The team were inspired by fireflies and glow worms that both produce what's called bioluminescence.

Bioluminescence is the process that makes these creatures produce naturally-occurring light from their bodies. 

The team start off by getting glowing protein enzymes called Luciferase, from the genes of fireflies or from bacteria.

They then use software called Genome Compiler to make it possible for the plants to read what those genes are. 

The genes are then made in labs and shipped to the team in California.

The Californian scientists have tested their technology on a range of plants in their DIY biolab. Anyone who pledges money to the project's Kickstarter campaign can get a glow-in-the-dark rose, or be given the chance to buy one before anyone else

Evans and his team put these genes into liquid agrobacteria and the bacteria is poured over the plants. 

Agrobacteria is able to transfer genes into plants, and when these glowing genes are added, they are transferred to the plants, which makes them glow-in-the-dark.  

To create these genes, the scientists have had to redesign the DNA sequence.

They have successfully managed to create small glowing plants and are now asking for extra funding, via a Kickstarter campaign, to use the technology on larger plants and trees.

The campaign ends on 7 June.

So far it has had more than 5,000 backers and raised over £183,000.
