Famously freewheeling San Francisco may no longer be a city where anything goes - and that includes clothing.

The city's lawmakers are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on laws that would ban nudity in most public places - and, in a funny twist, it's a man called Wiener who's leading the campaign.

Supervisor for the gay Castro District Scott Wiener's proposals to ban anyone over the age of five from exposing 'his or her genitals, perineum or anal region on any public street, sidewalk, street median, parklet or plaza' have caused outrage amongst the city's many nudie devotees.

Baring it all: a man protesting a city ban on public nudity undresses at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco

No place to hide: Scott Wiener will face plenty of public opposition 
Tuesday when officials vote at City Hall (right) on a ban on public 
nudity. Sheriffs plan to escort at the hearing who tries to strip in 
protest from the building

Wiener felt compelled to act two years
ago after constituents complained about the naked men who gather in a 
small Castro plaza most days and sometimes walk the streets au naturel.

He persuaded his colleagues last year 
to pass a law requiring a cloth to be placed between public seating and 
bare rears, yet the complaints have continued.

'I don't think having some guys taking
their clothes off and hanging out seven days a week at Castro and 
Market Street is really what San Francisco is about. I think it's a 
caricature of what San Francisco is about,' Wiener said.

The proposed ban predictably has produced outrage, as well as a lawsuit.

Outrage: many San Francisco residents are angry at Castro District supervisor Scott Wiener for sponsoring the proposed public nudity ban

Last week, about two dozen people disrobed in front of City Hall and marched around the block.

McCray Winpsett, 37, said he 
understands the disgust of residents who would prefer not to see the 
body modifications and sex enhancement devices sported by some of the 
Castro nudists.

But he thinks Wiener's prohibition goes too far in undermining a tradition 'that keeps San Francisco weird.'

'A few lewd exhibitionists are really ruining it for the rest of us,' he said.

'It's my time to come out now to 
present myself in a light and show what true nudity is all about so 
people can separate the difference between what a nudist is and an 
exhibitionist is.'

Because clothes are required to enter 
City Hall itself, demonstrators who try to disrobe at the Board of 
Supervisors meeting will be escorted out by sheriff's deputies.

San Francisco lawyer Christina 
DiEdoardo filed a federal lawsuit last week on behalf three men that 
seeks to block Wiener's ordinance, if it passes and is signed by Mayor 
Edwin Lee.

The complaint alleges that the ban 
infringes on the free speech rights of nudists and discriminates against
those who cannot afford to obtain a city permit.

While it may seem strange that going 
out in the buff is not already illegal in San Francisco, most California
cities do not have local nudity laws, Wiener said.

'I suspect there are a lot of places 
that maybe don't currently have a local law (and) that if people started
getting naked every day would quickly see a local law,' Wiener said.

If Wiener's ban is passed, the violators will face a maximum penalty of a $100 fine for a first offense.

But prosecutors would have authority 
to charge a third violation as a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 
fine and a year in jail.

Exemptions would be made for 
participants at permitted street fairs and parades, such as the city's 
annual gay pride event and the Folsom Street Fair, which celebrates 
sadomasochism and other sexual subcultures.
