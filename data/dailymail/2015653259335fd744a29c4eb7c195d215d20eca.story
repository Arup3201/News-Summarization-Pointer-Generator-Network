Midfielder Jack Collinson has written an emotional 2,800-word open letter to West Ham fans on the club's official website following his release from the club - and he even signed it off with a kiss.

The 25-year-old Wales international described his nine-year spell at the club as a 'rollercoaster' and paid tribute to the 'very special family' of West Ham supporters.

He had been at the Hammers since he was 16 but he was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Sam Allardyce.

Praise: Collinson paid tribute to the 'West Ham family', including talking of his pride at promotion in 2012

In the letter, Collinson describes his journey from being a 'star-struck' trainee to scoring in the Premier League, as well as playing against Millwall despite his father having died just before the match.

He gives a season-by-season account of his time at the club and relives his best and worst moments from his time at the Hammers.

It reads: 'At that point as the ball struck the net, I felt a feeling I will maybe never feel again - so much excitement, so much emotion and so much relief.

'I had made history. I had scored in the Premier League. Not just for anyone, but wearing the famous Claret and Blue.

'It was at this point I felt the start of my special relationship with the fans - one that has helped me through tough times and also many shared great times.

'It was at this point I felt part of the West Ham family, a family I was desperate to be part of, I finally felt like I belonged.'

Committed: Collinson made 121 appearances for the Hammers over nine years, scoring 14 goals

Fond farewell: The midfielder says he leaves Upton Park with great memories of the club and its fans

'Not many can say they have had the honour of wearing the famous Claret and Blue but I hope they (the fans) know I truly feel blessed for the opportunity.

Collinson made his first-team debut against Arsenal in January 2008 and went on to make 121 appearances for West Ham, scoring 14 goals.

He spent the final two months of last season on loan at Wigan Athletic, making 10 appearances and he was also loaned out to Bournemouth in October 2013.
