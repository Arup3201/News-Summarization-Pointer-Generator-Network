Jon Venables (pictured aged ten) abducted, tortured and then murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. He was jailed last year after he was caught with a stash of depraved images

Child killer Jon Venables is being kept in prison for his own safety – because he cannot be trusted with keeping a new identity secret.

Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were ten when they were jailed for life after they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.

When they were released in 2001  amid a public outcry, they were given new identities to protect them from vigilantes.

But after Venables was jailed again last year, when he was caught with of stash of child pornography, it emerged the killer had already blown his own cover.

Officials have now ruled out giving him a second false identity – which costs taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds – on the grounds he would not be able to keep his real past hidden, sources have told the Mail.

The extraordinary development means that Venables will remain in prison for the foreseeable future for his own safety.

Denise Fergus, James’s mother, said: ‘In his twisted mind he believes the name Jon Venables makes him some kind of celebrity and he cannot resist telling people who he really is.

‘It seems he gets some kind of perverse thrill from it, and it’s clear he has no remorse about murdering my son.’

Draconian legal anonymity orders ban any information being revealed about the identities or whereabouts of Venables and Thompson, who killed James after luring him away from his mother in a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside.

During Venables’s child pornography trial last year, his barrister claimed the strain of living under an assumed name and constant threats to his life had led him into drink and drug addiction.

He then apparently became paranoid that friends had discovered his true identity and he began telling them who he really was, before calling his probation officer to raise the alarm.

Officials are now convinced that if released after completing his two-year sentence he would not be able to keep secret a second identity, leaving him a sitting duck.

‘If Venables were to be given a new identity the chances are that he would compromise it,’ said a source. ‘That puts him in danger of vigilante attacks.

‘It is safer for him if he remains in custody until he no longer poses a risk of revealing his true identity. Venables received a life sentence for the murder of James Bulger, so they can keep hold of him for as long as they want.’

The decision not to give Venables a new name comes despite a High Court ruling that he was in ‘clear and present danger’ of being killed should his true identity ever be revealed.

Last night, prison sources confirmed there were ‘no current plans’ to create a new identity for the 29-year-old killer, who is still using the alias he was given in 2001. ‘It would be a pointless waste of money  giving him a new identity at the moment because he is unable to keep his real name a secret,’ said one source.

‘He remains at risk of revealing his true identity, and until that is resolved he won’t be given a new name or be released from prison.’

Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: ‘Changing a criminal’s identity is an extremely expensive thing to do. The decision will not be taken if there is a risk the individual involved would fully disclose his identity to others.

‘For his own safety, to protect the individual from others, he would remain in confinement in prison.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment.
