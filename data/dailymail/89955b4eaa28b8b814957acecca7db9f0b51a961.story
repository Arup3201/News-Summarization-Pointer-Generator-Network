He's surged to become one of the most talked-about politicians in the U.S.

Now as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie prepares to make a final decision on whether to run for president, a poll revealed he is almost in a dead heat with Barack Obama for the White House.

But even though he is developing into the most popular contender, critics are threatening to take his legs away before he has even started running by saying he is simply too fat to become president.

Decision time: As New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, prepares to make a final call on whether to run for president, a poll revealed he is almost in a dead heat with Barack Obama, right, for the White House

President Obama is now backed by 44 per cent of likely voters and Governor Christie is a whisker behind with the support of 43 per cent, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released today.

Age: 49

Famous quote: 'Get the hell off the beach' (to New Jersey hurricane surfers last month)

Governor Christie is expected to make a decision on whether to run this weekend, as he reportedly already has the backing of his family, many senior GOP figures and big-spending donors.

But commentators and influential figures are circling around Governor
Christie over the issue of his weight, with some suggesting he is 
simply too fat for president and others joking that he goes on the ‘Al 
Sharpton Jailhouse Diet’.

Reverend Al Sharpton, who has himself suggested a presidential run in the past, pulled off a hunger strike in 2001 during a 90-day prison sentence for trespassing on a U.S. Navy base.

'Most of what we eat is what we think we want,' Reverend Sharpton joked on MSNBC. 'So what I think we should do is put Governor Christie in jail for 90 days.'

Grover Cleveland (1885-1889) - 250lbs

Food fanatic President Cleveland once wrote: 'I must go to dinner, but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find.'

Warren Harding (1921-1923) - 200lbs

Keen musician but heavy smoker President Harding was born in Ohio and died in California of a heart attack, aged only 57. He suffered from high blood pressure.

Presenter Joe Scarborough suggested that could be called the 'Al Sharpton Jailhouse Diet'.

Bloomberg political commentator Michael Kinsley suggested that being fat could actually benefit Governor Christie by ‘authenticating his portrayal of Everyman (who) is sick to death of Washington’.

But he added: ‘The symbolism of Christie’s weight problem goes way past the issue of obesity itself.

‘It is just a too-perfect symbol of our country at the moment, with appetites out of control and discipline near zilch. And it’s not just symbolism. We don’t yet know much about Chris Christie.’

Noel Sheppard of Newsbusters also pointed out that obese liberals New York Congressman Jerry Nadler and film-maker Michael Moore have not received so much focus on their weight.

Governor Christie has come under intense pressure from the GOP to run because many are doubtful whether any current Republican candidates will be good enough to challenge President Obama.

He is seen as the most electable of all 
because of his no-nonsense approach, epitomised when he told surfers to 
‘get the hell off the beach’ before Hurricane Irene struck the East 
Coast in August.

Martin Bashir of MSNBC said the GOP is making out Governor Christie as ‘the great white hope’ - a reference to 1970 boxing film ‘The Great White Hope’, with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander.

But Rasmussen Reports president Scott Rasmussen said: ‘As Rick Perry has recently demonstrated, it’s easier being on the outside with people begging you to run than it is to actually run a campaign.

‘Running for president is a unique role in America, and there’s no way of knowing how a candidate will perform unless they actually try it.’

Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: ‘Chris Christie needs to find some way to lose weight. Like everyone else, elected officials perform best when they are in optimal health.

‘Christie’s weight is as legitimate an issue as the smoking habit that President Obama says he has finally kicked,’ he added, before advising Governor Christie to ‘eat a salad and take a walk’.

Governor Christie told CNN in June that he has been ‘really struggling’ for a long time with his weight and feels ‘a sense of guilt at times’ about not getting it under control for the sake of his children.

He was hospitalised for asthma soon after that interview and admitted he needed to lose weight – with National Institutes of Health estimates appearing to show he is ‘extremely obese’.

Governor Christie - who was viewed favourably overall in the poll - has already received the backing of former first lady Nancy Reagan, secretary of state Henry Kissinger and president George W. Bush.

More than half of GOP voters have a favourable opinion of Governor Christie - although 35 per cent of likely voters still have no opinion on him, reported the New York Post.

Ex-Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney would get 44 per cent to President Obama’s 42 per cent.
