An California man slated to be a contestant in an upcoming season of The Bachelorette is in a coma and clinging to life after a horrible paragliding accident Sunday.

Eric Hill, an intrepid 32-year-old on a personal quest to see every UN recognized country on Earth, slammed into a Utah mountainside after a parachute malfunctioned in high turbulence.

His injuries were grievous and authorities say he suffered serious head trauma despite having worn all the proper safety gear including a helmet.

'He experienced a partial parachute collapse, which swung him into the mountainside with some velocity,' Unified Fire Authority Battalion Chief Brian Anderton told KUTV. 'It doesn't seem like he fell an extremely long distance, but the velocity that he went into the hillside was enough to cause some trauma.'

Hill was was rushed to an area hospital, where he remained in a coma Tuesday.

The reality TV contestant had already been eliminated from the competition where he vied for the affections of bachelorette Andi Dorfman, at the time of the accident.

According to his friend, Hill was an experienced paraglider and KUTV reports that he was often in Utah where the activity is widely popular.

'He's well experienced. He knows what he's doing,' the friend, Derek Mazur, told KUTV. 'Just kind of that time of year. Spring, the air is really rough and a lot of turbulence.'

But Anderton warned that safety gear and experience aren't always a match for mother nature.

'Pay attention to the weather conditions and be familiar with what they're getting into,' he warned.

Hill had yet to achieve notoriety for his television appearance, but had made a name for himself online for his exploits as a world traveler.

For the project he dubbed The Global Odyssey: Finding Awesome in Every Country, Hill was determined to visit all 194 UN-recognized world countries in record time and by the time of the horrible accident he was well on his way.

Social media accounts picture the handsome traveler in breathtaking shots from Finland to Djibouti.

In the most recent message on his project's Facebook page, someone posted the following on Tuesday evening:

'Friends: Eric has been in a horrible paragliding accident and is currently in critical condition in a coma. Things are not looking good right now...please, all across the world, even if you're not a praying person, please pray for him. He needs your prayers more than ever.'
