The mother of a cancer-stricken teenager who passed away two days after fulfilling his last wish to take his girlfriend to the school prom said she is 'devastated and heartbroken'.

Jak Trueman, 15, was applauded by tearful classmates at the school dance which was organised at the last minute after doctors told him he was dying last week. 

Thousands have now paid tribute to the young Rangers fan who kept his promise to take long-term girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, to West Calder High's prom in West Lothian, Scotland.

His mother wrote on the Jak's Journey Facebook page earlier today, saying: 'Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven, God bless.

'Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever. Simply the best.' 

His long-term girlfriend Hannah also posted four hearts on the Facebook page after hearing the news that he had passed away.

The teenager's condition deteriorated rapidly over the last couple of days and he needed pain relief to be able to attend his prom.

He could only stay for 10 minutes at the dance which was held at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder as he started to feel unwell.

After the event  he wrote a message saying: 'I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.

'I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.

The youngster's dying wish was to accompany Hannah, who he has been dating for almost two years, to their last school event together

'Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along, even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.'

He was diagnosed with terminal T-Cell Lymphoma in August last year and was in line to take more treatment until scans showed early last week the cancer had spread throughout his body.

His mother revealed they were living 'minute by minute, hour by hour' desperate for him to improve. 

'We will just take it minute by minute hour by hour,' she said. 'The prom was about my boy and Hannah.

'He managed to make the evening for 10 minutes through wonderful courage and determination.'

The teenager's long-term girlfriend Hannah posted four hearts on Jak's Facebook page after hearing the news

She added: 'Jak and Hannah are exceptionally close and I think it is absolutely magical that the school brought the prom forward, what they have done this for both of them

'It is overwhelming what the school has arranged.'

Jak  dedicated his last few days to raising cash for charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and raised more than £33,000 in less than a week.

'A phenomenal amount for my phenomenal boy - making things a little easier knowing others will benefit,' Mrs Trueman added.

He hoped to raise enough cash to set up the charity 'Team Jak' which will offer additional support for youngsters battling cancer. 

Jak was diagnosed with terminal T-Cell Lymphoma in August last year and vowed to use his last few days to raise money for charity

Breaking the news of his worsening condition to his friends, he said: 'Well, that's it. 'Worse case scenario has happened. I have been preparing myself for this answer all day although it still came hard to take.

'My very experienced Doctors and Professors have looked at the PET scan from today and the disease has spread into all my bones and organs.

'They have decided not to go any further with any more treatment. 

'I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.

'I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past 6 months, they have tried their best for me.' 

Thousands of well-wishers  have left tributes on his Facebook page, along with friends and family.

Judith Chalmers said: 'What a wonderful boy and you are one of the bravest people I know. The fact he was loved by all is a credit to you. Hugs to the rest of the family.'
