The agony for Nottingham Forest is that there are only eight games left in their late pursuit of the play-offs. The ecstasy is Michail Antonio.

The powerhouse winger showed improbable runs to glory can be completed with a solo goal to savour as manager Dougie Freedman collected another three points.

Antonio’s display was the story of this match. More than once he beat Rotherham’s defenders for strength and pace before applying a deftness of touch.

His goal, as the interval approached, was a combination of his talents. Picking up the ball well inside his own half, he turned and galloped. He checked inside Jack Hunt, sped clear of Kari Arnason, cut across Farrend Rawson and unleashed a shot from 25 yards that flew into the bottom corner.

There was an inevitability about it all. Eric Lichaj will be credited with the assist but in much the same way a tee might aid a 300-yard drive by Rory McIlroy.

It was Antonio’s 13th goal of the season since a £1.5million move from Sheffield Wednesday. What a bit of business that now looks.

Two minutes earlier Antonio had set up the opener, lofting a ball into the path of Dexter Blackstock. The striker crept behind Kirk Broadfoot and lobbed a finish that goalkeeper Adam Collin got a hand to but in vain.

The result extends Freedman’s record to seven wins, two draws, and one defeat since taking over from Stuart Pearce. Brentford, in sixth, are eight points ahead. It seems just too much, but you never know. 

Rotherham are in a similar predicament at the other end. Steve Evans’ team sit six points above the drop zone. They mounted a challenge of sorts in the second half, and very nearly pulled one back when Lee Frecklington sent a sweet shot against the post.

Karl Darlow then produced a magnificent save with 17 minutes left when diving to keep out Conor Sammon’s firm shot.

With the match won, Freedman gave 18-year-old Tyler Walker, son of Forest legend Des, his debut as an injury time substitute.

Evans said: ‘It’s a cruel game, we were the better side in the first half for long spells.’

But the night belonged to Antonio. ‘Every team needs a bit of magic and certainly Michail gives us that,’ said Freedman.

He added a thinly veiled call to neighbours Derby, who have not won in five games. ‘Of course the season is finishing too early but we need to make sure we take care of business and keep on winning,’ Freedman said.

‘It’s a fierce competition like I’ve never seen. Teams above us are really panicking. Certain teams that are not too far away from us location-wise.’

Antonio has scored 13 goals since his £1.5 million move from Sheffield Wednesday last summer
