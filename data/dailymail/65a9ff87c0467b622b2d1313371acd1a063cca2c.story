The mother of Baby P is planing to move in with a woman convicted of an appalling sex attack once both are released from jail, it was reported today.

Tracey Connelly formed a close bond with Toni Hewitson while both were serving time at HMP Low Newton in Durham and would reportedly 'sneak off to each other's cells'.

Despite being separated when they were moved to different prisons, they have kept in touch through letters and are hoping to set up a home together soon.

A prison source told The Sunday People: 'Tracey knew she would be a marked woman once she was released, and Toni and her talked about getting a place together. They make a formidable couple.'

Hewitson, 39, was jailed in 2008 for torturing and sexually assaulting a woman with learning difficulties, while part of a gang of four.

The victim, who was 25 at the time of the attack, was strapped to a chair, gagged, slashed and raped during the ordeal, and also had her head shoved down a toilet.

She was handed an indeterminate sentence for the public's protection and was told she would serve a minimum of five-and-a-half years.

Tragic: Tracey Connelly was jailed for r allowing her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen to torture her 17-month-old son Peter (pictured)  to death in Haringey, North London, in 2007

But she is now thought to be preparing for her release and believes she will be out in the next 12 months thanks to good behaviour.

Connelly, 34, is thought to be awaiting a Parole Board hearing at the women's jail HMP Styal in Cheshire.

She was jailed again for breaching the terms of her licence by trying to sell pornographic pictures of herself to perverts transfixed with her notoriety.

Her offence came less than 18 months after she was released  following a five-year jail term for allowing her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen to torture her 17-month-old son Peter to death in Haringey, North London, in 2007.

The Mirror source added: 'Lots of the women have flings and they go from one woman to another and the ones in for sex crimes or other stomach-churning offences seem to gravitate towards each other. 

'Tracey and Toni spent a lot of time together in the exercise yard and then would sneak off to each other's cells.'

The source claimed that while sex between inmates is against the rules, many officers turn a blind eye to relationships within prisons.
