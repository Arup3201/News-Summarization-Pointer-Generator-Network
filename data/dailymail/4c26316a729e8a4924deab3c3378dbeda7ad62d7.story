The body of a Queens woman who went missing in December washed up in a marshland near the Atlantic Ocean in Breezy Point, New York, on Saturday morning

Her cold body, which was still in pajamas, had experienced trauma and her hands and legs were tied up, police say.

The distraught family of 24-year-old Marisha Cheong say her possessive live-in boyfriend, Latchman Balkaran, was directly involved in her death.

Body found: The body of Marisha Cheong, who went missing on December 19, washed up in a marshland in Breezy Point, New York

Possible suspect: Cheong's family say her live-in boyfriend, Latchman Balkaran, was directly involved in her death

There have been no arrests, but Balkaran is being questioned by police about Cheong’s disappearance. Police have not yet named a suspect.

He reportedly told investigators that he was making a delivery when his girlfriend went missing. Police have said that they confirmed his whereabouts and let him 
go, but have not ruled him out, police have said.

'I'm just trying to be as strong as I can at this moment,' Balkaran told  DNAinfo.com after Cheong's body was discovered. 'I'm still thinking she's gonna come through that door.'

Cheong, a Long Island University student studying business administration, disappeared on the morning of December 19 from the Jamaica, Queens, home that she shared with 26-year-old Balkaran, not far from where her body washed up.

Cheong, a 5-foot-7 brunette, was last seen alive on video camera. The footage showed her entering her home and then leaving with another person five minutes later, police said.

Cheong's mother, Bibi Ali, told reporters that Balkaran was a controlling boyfriend and kept the passwords to Cheong’s iPhone and iPad.

‘I want him to tell me what he did, how she ended up on the beach. He knows. He has to know,.

‘He's obsessive over her. He's very obsessive,’ she said.

Cheong's cousin, Andrey Azeez, also said that her boyfriend was extremely controlling.

Police interviewed Balkaran, a delivery man and an aspiring Bollywood film director, when Cheong disappeared in December and questioned him again on Monday.

'Staying strong': 'I'm just trying to be as strong as I can at this moment,' Balkaran said after Cheong's body was discovered. 'I'm still thinking she's gonna come through that door'

Balkaran said that he is not responsible for his girlfriend's disappearance and cannot believe she's gone

Balkaran said that he is not responsible for her disappearance, and cannot believe she's gone.

‘She was the sweetest person you'd ever meet,’ he said. ‘She would not harm a soul. I still can't believe it. I want to find who did this. We will find who did this.’

Balkaran also praised the investigators on the case.

‘They've been nothing but kind. I respect what they're doing,’ he said.

Balkaran said he and Cheong planned to marry and that he had planned to propose to her around New Year's.

‘I'm just trying to be as strong as I can at this moment,’ he said. ‘I'm still thinking she's gonna come through that door.’

The medical examiner will determine the exact cause of Cheong’s death after an autopsy is performed, which could take several weeks.

The investigation is on-going.
