Detectives have 'grave concerns' for missing Samantha Henderson who disappeared from her home three days ago

Detectives hunting for a missing mother-of-four have arrested a man on suspicion of her murder.

Dorset police said it has 'grave concerns' for Samantha Henderson, 25, who vanished three days ago.

A 27-year-old man, known to the young woman, has been arrested by officers and is being questioned on suspicion of her murder.

Ms Henderson's family have made an emotional plea for her to return to her home in Corfe Castle, Dorset.

'Sam is a homely, private, loving mother of four children aged six, four, two and one,' they said.

'She is hard-working, always presentable and this is completely out of character for her.

'She would never walk out and leave her children. If anyone knows where she is or what has happened, please contact the police.'

Ms Henderson's family have also made a direct appeal to the missing woman, adding: 'No one is upset or thinks anything badly of you Sam. We just want you to come home as everyone wants to help and support you.'

She was reported missing shortly before 9am on Thursday but was last seen leaving her home at 4.30pm on Wednesday. 

She is described as white, five feet three inches tall, of very slim build and with blonde hair in a ponytail. She was last seen wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and slippers.

Extensive investigations are continuing, including a forensic examination of Ms Henderson's home and the surrounding area.

Police also urged nearby residents to check garages, garden sheds and outbuildings for any sign of the missing mother.

Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, from Dorset Police, said: 'We are extremely concerned for Samantha and while we are hoping for the best, sadly we believe she may have come to some harm.

'We have arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of her murder and he is currently being questioned. We do not know at this time Samantha's whereabouts.

The young woman's family described her as 'a loving mother' and said her disappearance was 'out of character'

'Samantha's disappearance is completely out of character. She has never gone missing before and, from what we understand, it is almost unfathomable that she would have left her four young children.

'We also know that Samantha made heavy use of her mobile phone and social media and I would urge anyone who has had any correspondence with her since 3pm on Wednesday to call Dorset Police.'

He added: 'I am calling on the public to check their garages, garden sheds and outbuildings in the area in the event Samantha may have taken refuge and fallen unwell.'
