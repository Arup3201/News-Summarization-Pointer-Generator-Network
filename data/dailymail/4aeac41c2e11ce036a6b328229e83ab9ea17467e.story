With the charts already dominated by electronic music, an all robot band is the obvious next step.

But while Daft Punk and others have relied on costumes, one Italian music producer decided to actually create a real robot band.

The Toa Mata Band is made up entirely of Lego robots, and has already released its first video and become an online hit.

Rehearsal time: The band play a variety of instruments, from a Stylophone to a drum machine - although their musuical direction does veer towards instruments that can be hit.

The robot band is the brainchild of Italian music producer Giuseppe Acito.

He built the robots along with his son, and drum pads, percussion instruments and synthesizers.

'My passion for the Lego world was born in the early 70's when I was a child and the bricks had just arrived Italy,' he said.

'I have re-discovered the passion for it with my son Mattia, a big collector of vintage LEGO - and the Bionicle Toa Mata team is part of his world.'

'Opificio sonico (sonic factory in english) is the name of my lab near Modena.'

The band is controlled by an iPad, while a small computer called an Arduino converts the singals from the iPad into 'hit's on the robot's arms.
