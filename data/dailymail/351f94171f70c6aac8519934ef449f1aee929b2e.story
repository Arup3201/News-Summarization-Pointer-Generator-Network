North Carolina police say they have proof a 17-year-old Latino teen, whose hands were cuffed behind his back, fatally shot himself in the head last year.

Durham police today released the 
preliminary findings of their internal investigation into the death of Jesus Huerta as he sat in the back of a police car on November 
19.

Police said evidence clears officers of any wrongdoing, as an autopsy report revealed Huerta died from a gunshot wound to the face at close range.

Findings: North Carolina police claim they have evidence which shows 
Jesus Huerta, 17, shot himself in the face while his hands were 
handcuffed behind his back while in police custody on November 19

Police told a press conference today that investigators found gunpowder 
residue on a white, batting-style glove that Huerta was wearing and none
 on the arresting officer's hand.

Authorities say the officer checked the car at the start of his shift and found no weapon.

However Huerta's family says the findings have raised more questions than answers, repeating their call for a federal investigation.

'Is this the type of police culture we want? The culture starts at the top, at the chief,' family attorney Alex Charns said, according to WNCN.com.

'Why was the family left in the parking lot without answers? Most of what they had to say today, they knew that morning.'

On November 19, Huerta's sister called 911 to report him missing.

Police found the runaway teen at Washington Street and Trinity Avenue about 2.30 a.m. A search revealed Huerta had an outstanding warrant for a second-degree trespassing violation.

Officer Sam Duncan  arrested Huerta, handcuffed him behind his 
back and placed him in a patrol car after patting him down. A gun was not detected.

Cops said on the way to the police station, Huerta shot himself.

An initial police report said the cruiser's internal video was not turned on at the time. The camera was started at 6.05pm when Duncan initially logged on to the system but he did not turn the camera back on after picking up Huerta.Â 

Officers said Huerta shot himself with a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun but did not say how the teenager got the gun.

The controversial case has sparked at least two demonstrations against police regarding the department's handling of the Huerta case.

In one protest, officers used tear gas to disperse crowds that had gathered in downtown Durham. Police said some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles at officers.

Meanwhile late last month, a peaceful vigil for Huerta ended in violence.

The supporters began at Durham City Hall and marched towards Durham Police Department, shadowed by police.

According to the News Observer, as the crowd surged towards the Police Department parking lot police commanded them to leave.

The crowd continued into the parking lot, some carrying signs that read: 'murdered by police'.

Police,
 some dressed in riot gear, used tear gas and batons to disperse the 
crowd of about 150 friends, family and supporters as they marched.

A coordinator of the vigil, Rafael Estrada Maya called for quiet and restraint.

'We are praying! Respect prayer! Respect the dead,' he pleaded over a loudspeaker.

The crowd departed the parking lot and began to move back towards Durham's downtown area where younger members of the crowd chanted and threw firecrackers at the ranks of armed riot police.

Intimidation: Huerta's family say police tried to intimidate and spread fear among protesters who are demanding answers in the death of the teen

Smoke bombs and tear gas were released and according to a witness, police beat protesters with sticks.

'They
 didn't really look like batons or night sticks, but they were thinner 
and longer and they were reaching over the banner whacking people with 
them,' said David Kaplan.

'They
 were clearly upset with the fact that people were out expressing 
themselves and upset at the fact that it appears they murdered a 
17-year-old child.'

Police Chief Jose Lopez said his officers were restrained in their treatment of the protesters.

'I
 could not be more proud of the restraint and professionalism 
demonstrated by our officers," Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez said in a 
statement to the media.

'There
 was a march. The peaceful intent did not exist. We used the best 
practices in law enforcement,' he said at a news conference Friday.

At least six protesters were arrested.
