Ed Miliband was facing further attacks on his leadership today as damning polls showed he was now less popular than Nick Clegg.

Former Labour deputy Prime Minister John Prescott accused 'pointy heads' like Mr Miliband of running a series of disastrous election campaigns which have allowed the party's support to slump.

The party's support has hit 32 per cent – the lowest in four years – while Mr Miliband has seen his own approval ratings slump hit rock bottom.

Ed Miliband is now more unpopular than Nick Clegg, according to a poll released today by YouGov

Mr Miliband is less unpopular in the north of England than elsewhere - but even in Labour's heartland just under seven in 10 voters say he is doing a bad job

Just 18 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband is doing a good job, against 73 per cent who think he is doing badly – an overall rating of minus 55, which is now worse than Mr Clegg, on minus 54.

David Cameron, meanwhile, has an overall rating of minus 14. Some 40 per cent of voters think he is doing a good job, against 54 who think he is doing poorly, according to a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times.

Overall, Labour still retains a one-point lead over the Tories, who sit on just 31 per cent.

Labour's dire polls, less than six months before the general election, have piled further pressure on Mr Miliband.

Lord Prescott said Labour's campaign strategy needed a complete overhaul before the election. Writing in the Sunday Mirror he said: 'To be frank, our campaigns have not been very successful. 

'From the 2010 general election to local and European elections and by-elections, it seems strategy is driven by the pointy-heads not the lionhearts.

'The Scottish referendum campaign was only saved by dedicated old-school campaigners like Gordon Brown and Jim Murphy who went out and spoke with passion about Labour's values, achievements and positive case for the future. In these last six months we need passionate campaigners to sell our popular policies.'

Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott - seen listening to Ed Miliband's party conference speech this year - said the party needed less 'pointy heads' in charge - and more 'lionhearts'

Jim Murphy, the front-runner to be the next Labour leader in Scotland, this morning warned the part faced electoral annihilation if it did not put an end to the infighting.

He said: 'Parties that turn in on themselves - think of the footballing analogy - if a football team tackles its own players in public or takes on its own players in public it very quickly starts to play in an empty football stadium without any supporters.

'And there's a lesson in that football analogy for the Labour party and all the political parties as we watch the Tory party tear itself apart. But I'm confident Ed Miliband's Labour party won't do that sort of thing.' 

Shadow Secretary of State for International Development Jim Murphy appeared on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show this morning

Mr Murphy formally launched his campaign to become Scottish Labour Leader and First Minister of Scotland yesterday

Mr Murphy also announced he was going to stand down as shadow international development secretary to concentrate on winning the leadership in Scotland.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper – the favourite to succeed Mr Miliband if Labour loses the next election – today praised Mr Miliband for 'holding the party together'.

Scotland's outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond, meanwhile, said Labour would continue to struggle north of the border – because it sided with the Tories against independence.

He said Labour would not be 'forgotten or forgiven for a generation' for joining forces with the Tories to campaign against independence.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said it was possible that the SNP could go into Coalition with Labour in Westminster

But Mr Salmond refused to rule out a coalition between the SNP and Labour, if they were to hold the balance of power at the next general election.

But did say there was 'no chance' of the party forming a deal with the Tories.

He said: 'I think it's unlikely but who knows, people change sometimes, parties change sometimes, party leaders change sometimes and lead them in a different direction.'
