This is the first picture of a Spanish woman who was one of three generations of a family - all of whom were called Emma - that were killed in last week's Germanwings disaster.

Emma Pardo Vidal, her 12-year-old daughter Emma Solera Pardo, and her mother Emma Vidal Bardan were among 50 Spanish passengers on board flight 9525 to Dusseldorf.

They were due to take a connecting flight from the German city to Manchester where another family member was studying English.

Prosecutors say co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and aimed the aircraft down in an eight-minute descent until it hit the ground

But all of those on board the flight to Germany were killed after prosecutors say co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and aimed the aircraft down in an eight-minute descent until it hit the ground.

Juan Pardo Yanez - the child's grandfather and former husband of the eldest Emma - was virtually speechless after returning from a trip for relatives of the 150 crash victims to the crash zone in Seyne-Les-Alpes, France.

Investigators were still working in a ravine collecting small pieces of the plane and body parts ahead of a painstaking identification effort.

'There is nothing that can be done or could be said to me to change the loss of these three so dearly loved ones,' Pardo Yanez told journalists outside a Barcelona crisis center set up for victims' relatives.

About 400 friends and relatives of the daughter, mother and grandmother gathered for a private Mass at a monastery in Sant Cugat del Valles, choking up as they went inside to commemorate those lost from the family that moved to the community of about 85,000 about a decade ago.

The youngest Emma's father, Juan Ignacio Solera, is the founder and chief executive of iVOOX, a company that makes a popular software application for podcast downloads.

Emma went to a Catholic school just a five-minute walk away from the family's apartment in a cluster of buildings ringed by high brick walls. 

Her death hit classmates incredibly hard, said principal Maria Reina Montoro, who could only come up with one word to describe how they felt: 'Destroyed.'

While  quiet and timid, the youngest Emma was a dedicated tennis player who regularly practiced at a club, said Manu Navas, director of the club's tennis academy.  

'She wasn't a player who stood out, but what I would highlight about her was her attitude. She never took no for an answer,' Navas said of the girl.

Pardo Yanez did not say how he would try to help rebuild his life and family now that his ex-wife is gone along with one of his daughters and a granddaughter.

But he was sure of one thing: 'I will return with all my children to the site where all of them have died.'
