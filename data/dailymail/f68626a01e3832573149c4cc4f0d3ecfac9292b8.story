Arsenal and England stars Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs became the latest footballers to take on the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge - and the pair went a step further by nominating Premier League referee Andre Marriner to be next to pour water over his head.

The two Gunners, shirtlessly awaiting the deluge of ice-cold water, each nominate fellow professionals, before turning their attention to the referee. 

Marriner famously dismissed Gibbs during Arsenal's trip to Chelsea last season after mistakenly believing he had handled on the goal-line. It was in fact Chamberlain who had committed the offense.

Freezing: The Arsenal stars are drenched, with Chamberlain screaming and running away in response

Mistaken: Gibbs is sent off by the referee despite the fact that it was Chamberlain who handled the ball

Chamberlain posted the video to his Instagram page, thanking Jack Wilshere for his nomination and urging followers to donate to the cause.

He also nominated Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling and boxer Anthony Joshua, while Gibbs challenged Manchester City full-back Bacary Sagna.

As members of the Arsenal training staff emptied the buckets of ice-cold water over them Chamberlain screamed loudly, while Gibbs seemed to handle the cold rather better.

Mocked: The referee came under fire for the decision, and the players have referred to it often on social media

Challenge: The England midfielder extended the challenge to his international teammate Raheem Sterling
