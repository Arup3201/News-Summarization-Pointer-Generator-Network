Dante Bonfim Costa Santos enters the World Cup on Tuesday. A Champions League winner with Bayern Munich, he will line up alongside the extravagant David Luiz at the heart of Brazil’s back line.

Luiz has had an excellent tournament and has displayed leadership qualities, scoring two goals and performing alongside the captain, Thiago Silva.

With Silva banned from the semi-final against Germany, Luiz will take the armband and will have to assume control of the back line. It’s a big night for the new Paris Saint-Germain signing from Chelsea.

But Dante is no fool. Now 30 and with a history of playing in Europe — in France, Belgium and now in the Bundesliga — the 6ft 2in centre half comes up against many of his club team-mates.

He will know what Thomas Muller can do — now can he stop him? Ironically, if there was one game you might want him in for, it is this one. 

Losing Neymar is a greater problem, because he’s the only one who scares the opposition defenders with goals and dribbles. I expect Oscar to have his favoured role, with Willian to come in to the side, but there will be pressure on the back four.

Youngster: Dante in Champions League action for Standard Liege against Liverpool in 2008

Like many Brazilians, Dante can be blase with the ball at his feet and is sometimes too casual —  he can give a forward a chance — but he’s no average understudy. 

He was part of a Bayern defence that conceded only 23 goals in 34 league games last season and finished with a goal difference of +71, winning the title in March.

I played against him in 2008 when Liverpool defeated Standard Liege 1-0 to qualify for the Champions League and he looked the part. Against Germany, we will discover how he has improved.

Brazil have got this far because of the goals from their central defenders. Dante and Luiz will need to be outstanding on Tuesday to keep up their progress.
