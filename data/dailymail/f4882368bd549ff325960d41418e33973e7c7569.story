A grandmother, who has been left devastated by the discovery of two abandoned babies in one week, has set up a 'safe haven' on her own doorstep.

Catherine Lucre from Camden, south west of Sydney, has also set up a Facebook page in which she offers to pick up any unwanted children from mothers who prefer to remain anonymous.

'I just want to offer another alternative to mothers than leaving their babies in a drain or burying it at the beach,' Mrs Lucre told Daily Mail Australia.

The mother-of-four started the Facebook page, Operation Safe Haven, following the discovery of a baby's body at Maroubra Beach

The 54-year-old mother-of-four, who works as a midwife, has shared her mobile phone number on the Facebook group, titled Operation Safe Haven, and encourages anyone in need to contact her. 

'If you're in distress or don't know what to do or you're scared or alone or worried for whatever reason – if you just have no other means of caring for your infant - contact me,' she said.

'That's just one way that I'm prepared to help people in this situation. If someone said that they lived in Wollongong, I'd be prepared to go down there and meet them somewhere or they can leave the baby somewhere and I'll get it if they want to remain anonymous.

'They can also leave their baby out the front and ring the doorbell and I'll leave it for ten seconds before I answer if they don't want to have a face to face meeting.'

'I'll leave it for ten seconds before I answer [the door] if they don't want to have a face to face meeting,' she told Daily Mail Australia 

Her offer comes following the discovery of a baby's body buried in the sand at Maroubra Beach and a newborn boy who was, only a week earlier, found abandoned in drain at Quakers Hill.

Mrs Lucre, who called police in 2009 to offer to pay for the funeral of a baby whose body had been found at a rubbish tip, said she has received an enormous amount of positive support for her offer, but is yet to be contacted by any mothers.

When that day comes, she said she would immediately take the infant to a hospital and contact the Department of Community Services and police, but promised to maintain the mother's privacy.

The registered nurse said that she would like to see the introduction of baby hatches, adding that she had met many mothers during her career as a midwife who were not aware of the services available to them.

'I understand there are reasons women are pushed to conceal their pregnancies, and there are a lot of women who suffer from depression,' Mrs Lucre said.

'They fear what you are going to do about it. For instance, when I was working in Aboriginal Health with DoCS, when you'd mention DoCS they would automatically think that you're going to take the baby straight away.

'People don't know what services are out there, DoCS can help you with housing for example.'

'I don't understand why we as a society aren't outraged by the discovery of babies being buried in the sand.'

'If the government isn't doing anything, I will.'
