Lightning forks, thunder claps and, finally, the sea fell out of the sky. That biblical scene caused qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix to be delayed for more than half an hour, but nothing could stop Lewis Hamilton taking pole again.

Sebastian Vettel will start second for Ferrari and Nico Rosberg in third for Mercedes.

Hurrah, Mercedes’ total dominance was interrupted after nine consecutive races in which they have locked out the front row of the grid.

Hamilton, who racked up his 40th pole position in F1, said: 'I think the first lap was quite good. None of us have driven this weekend in the wet and the first lap is just the unknown. You need a banker. The next one was up at one stage, but generally it was a fantastic job by the team.

'When you go out in the wet for the first time it is all about adapting to new conditions. Because there is water on the ground you don't know which part of the track you're going to slip out of corners but you're just trying to test it and feel it and I've always been pretty good at that.

'It is going to be a hard race being a bit earlier. It is going to be hotter and tougher for the tyres.

'I'm happy to see that Ferrari are doing really well and are so close, it shows we do have a race with someone else as well.'  

Television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit during Q1

Hamilton's pole position was his 40th in Formula One and second in a row to start the 2015 season 

The Brit finished 0.074 seconds ahead of Vettel in Q3 with his lap on the intermediate tyres

‘Yes, P2, great, Rosberg 50.2,’ chimed Vettel over the radio, having beaten his fellow German by three-tenths of a second in tough but drying conditions.

'Maybe it is just the track and condtions that went our way but hopefully we can keep that trend tomorrow,' the four-time world champion told Sky Sports after qualifying. 'I think it has been a bit too chilled for them (Mercedes) for the last few months.

'I think we can win but it depends on a lot of things. I think the pace looks decent but we have to be realistic that Mercedes still have an advantage. We just have to look after ourselves.'

Rosberg conceded he simply 'didn't drive well enough'.

He added: 'I'm annoyed by that, third place is not good enough.

'For tomorrow, I'm on the clean side of the grid so that should help me pass Seb at the start.' 

Vettel's P2 finish for Ferrari ended Mercedes' run of nine straight front-row lockouts 

Rosberg was annoyed by his P3 finish and simply admitted he was not good enough 

Hamilton set the fastest time with his first lap of the final session, skipping around adroitly on intermediate tyres.

His calm performance followed the delay caused when rain started to fall two minutes into the second session. It was soon bouncing ankle high off the Sepang track. 

The cars, which had lined up at the end of the pit straight to get on the track to set a time before the rain started, tiptoed back to the garage. The times already set stood: Hamilton was only eighth fastest. His Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was fastest.

‘You guys got me too far behind everyone, man,’ Hamilton radioed back to his team about not getting to the front of the queue. But he had at least scraped through into the final session of qualifying, where he was to show his class in wet conditions.

Vettel’s team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who was impeded on the busy track as he tried to set a fast lap, was eliminated early. He will start 11th.

Race officials called a hiatus of at least 15 minutes. The drivers got out of their car. Fans had already run for cover from the exposed green banks.

A restart was then planned for 6.15pm local time – a quarter of an hour after the scheduled end of the session with daylight beginning to fade.

The McLarens were out of the reckoning even before the rain started. Jenson Button had one-tenth of an advantage over his team-mate Fernando Alonso, but they were both eliminated in the first session.

‘I can’t get the tyres working,’ said Button, who will start 17th.

An optimistic Button told Sky Sports: 'When you get out of the car and you are 17th on the grid you're disappointed. But we've got to look at our progress and it is a lot of progress. We have made massive steps with the engine and are more competitive on the long run. It's still going to be tough tomorrow but we're making progress.

Alonso added: 'It is a tough period at the moment for us but the facts and numbers are much better than Australia in terms of pace and we are making progress. Every race we will improve and we will learn things.'

Alonso also struggled in the McLaren and will begin the race on Sunday in 18th place on the grid

Only the manor cars were below the McLarens on the timing sheets. Roberto Merhi was seven seconds off the pace while his team-mate Will Stevens did not even put in a lap. A fuel pressure problem was to blame, the latest in a catalogue of problems for the team.

Stevens however, will line up at the back of the grid after Manor applied successfully to the stewards to let him race  on the grounds he ‘set satisfactory times in practice’.

They failed even to get on to the track in Melbourne a fortnight ago and will have only Merhi representing them in the race here. Their part-participation in Formula One is in danger of turning into a prolonged embarrassment.
