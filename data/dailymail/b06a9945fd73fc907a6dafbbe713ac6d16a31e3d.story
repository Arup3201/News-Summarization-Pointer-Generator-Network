Globe-trotting Oscar the dog's latest trip has ended in tragedy after he was killed by a lorry in California.

The mongrel became an internet sensation after he travelled the world, stopping at iconic landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China, with his owner Joanne Lefson.

But his latest adventure ended in sadness last Friday when he died in San Jose, California.

The details of the accident have not yet been explained, The Telegraph has reported.

But Ms Lefson said Oscar's death 'has left a deep void in my heart, and in the world that he so extensively travelled to promote compassion and adoption for his homeless friends everywhere'.

On his official Facebook fan page she wrote: 'My dear Oscar, from a cement block in cage B5 at a Cape Town shelter to taking on the world, you were the impossible dream.

'You lived a life beyond imagination.

'How I live without you remains an unchartered mystery.'

Ms Lefson, who is half-British, rescued Oscar from a South African kennel - just a day before he was due to be put down.

The
 pair began their epic journey across five continents in 2009 in a bid 
to help millions of dogs without a home, visiting more than 20,000 dog 
shelters on the way.

Ms Lefson,
 who used money made from the sale of her home to fund trips, had been 
planning a trip to Nepal, where the pair were due to ascend to Mount 
Everest Base Camp to promote the cause of finding homes for stray dogs.

In September, MailOnline reported how Ms Lefson  said she 
would not stop travelling and raising awareness until every dog had a 
home.

She said: 'Travel remains in our 
bloodstream as does the case for dog adoption. An estimated half a 
billion dogs on the planet are homeless.

'When they're adopted, we'll unbuckle our seat belts and put our paws up.

'Oscar
 loved the helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon he seemed a little 
disappointed there weren't any crocs in the Canyon but anxiously watched
 at every turn for the odd animal to visually chase.

'During
 the balloon ride he barked his brains out. There must be something 
about all that fire in the sky that makes him barking mad.'

She added: 'When I discovered what a wonderful 
dog Oscar was it broke my heart to think how many Oscars are still out 
there and simply just don't get that second chance.

'I want to change perceptions of shelter dogs being old, abused and disturbed animals. Nothing could be further from the truth.'
