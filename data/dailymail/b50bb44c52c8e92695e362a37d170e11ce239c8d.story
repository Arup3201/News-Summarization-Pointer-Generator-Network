Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has insisted it would be 'crazy' for Boris Johnson not to play a key role in the party's election campaign next year.

Mr Johnson reacted angrily to suggestions in Saturday's Daily Mail that David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to persuade him to stand in 2015 so that he is fully bound in to the election result.

The Mayor's allies insisted it was 'bull****' that the Chancellor had already personally delivered him a message saying that he should attempt to return to the Commons next year.

It has been widely assumed that Downing Street would be against a 2015 Commons comeback, since it would suggest Mr Johnson wanted to be in place to challenge for the leadership because he expects Mr Cameron to lose the election and be ousted as party leader.

But a close ally of the Prime Minister told the Mail that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were 'telling Boris to stand' and 'own this campaign as much as anyone else'.

There has even been speculation that Mr Johnson could be offered a formal campaign role, even the party chairmanship – an offer that would be difficult to turn down.

Mr Johnson's supporters saw the intervention as an attempt to call his bluff – and prepare the ground in case he does decide to stage an early return to the Commons.

Yesterday, an ally of the Mayor told the Mail on Sunday that he believed Mr Osborne, who is also tipped as a future Tory leader, was responsible for trying to 'destabilise Boris'.

'This is nothing to do with party loyalty and everything to do with Osborne and Cameron trying to destabilise Boris. He saw it coming a mile off.

'They want to make sure that if the Tories lose, Boris gets as much flak as they do and can't stand as leader as a break with the failed Cameron-Osborne regime,' the source was quoted as saying.

Mr Shapps, speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday, attempted to calm the controversy – but suggested Mr Johnson should play a major role in the campaign, whatever his intentions on a return to Parliament.

'Boris is a guy who is able to communicate incredibly well and it would be crazy for him not to be part of the 2015 message,' he said.

'We all think Boris is a fantastic London Mayor and he's got a lot to offer. He's doing a brilliant job in London; his term runs till 2016, so he's got a little way to go, but no doubt he'll have many things to offer. What Boris does is up to Boris.'

A close friend of the Mayor attempted to play down the row, insisting: 'Boris's focus is on London – it was in 2012 when he stood for a second term, it will be in 2016 when he finishes that term.

'In between, only two things matter to Boris – delivering for London, and ensuring we have a majority Conservative government led by David Cameron after 2015. Boris will be out and about doing all he can to make sure that happens.'

Rebel Tory MP Mark Pritchard ‏condemned the speculation. 'Inside and outside of Parliament people are fed up of Old Etonians thinking they can pass on Number Ten like some sort of plaything or baton,' he said.

Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'The Chancellor is spending his time fighting with Boris Johnson like ferrets in a sack over a Tory leadership vacancy after the next election.

'Senior Tories should be getting to grips with the cost-of-living crisis facing ordinary families, not putting their own interests first.'

Mr Johnson, who was MP for Henley between 2001 and 2008, has encouraged 'will he, won't he' speculation about when he might stand again for the Commons.

Former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, now on trial over the phone hacking scandal, has said Mr Johnson is desperate to be prime minister but would rather see Mr Cameron 'fail miserably' than actively stab him in the back.

'Boris Johnson desperately wants to be prime minister and David has known that fact longer than most,' Mr Coulson said.

'When Boris asked me to pass on the message that he was keen to stand as mayor of London, David responded “Well, if he wins, he'll want my job next”.'

He added: 'Stabbing David, or anyone else for that matter, in the back would be distinctly off brand - just not very Boris. He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.'
