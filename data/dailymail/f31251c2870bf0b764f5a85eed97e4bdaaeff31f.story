Emmanuel Adebayor's older brother Kola claims the striker has been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch.

Kola, 42, a truck driver based in Bremen, Germany, told The Sun on Sunday: '[Emmanuel] has been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well.

'They have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him. My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again.'

Spurs striker Adebayor claimed his mother had done Juju on him but denied kicking her out of his house

Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition.

Adebayor was recently moved to deny accusations from his sister Maggie that he had kicked their mum Alice out of his house in Africa because he thought she had performed Juju curses on him.

Maggie claimed on radio station Peace FM in neighbouring Ghana that the Premier League striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year.

She said their mum was selling 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' to provide for her family however Emmanuel says his mother left the house of her own accord.

Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house.

'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing.

'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone.

'I bought a $1.2m house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?'

Kola tells The Sun that he sends Alice 400 euros a month. He says he is 'angry' at his brother and that Emmanuel's financial snub has 'left our family in poverty'.

While it's common for people who identify as Christian such as Emmanuel to visit a Muslim spiritual healer, Kola says the Spurs front man is 'seeing bad alfas and they are manipulating him'.

'If you are really a man of God then you have to catch our mother and prove she is a witch,' he says.

'Otherwise you are just lying to Emmanuel and taking his money.'

Tottenham has been contacted for a response. 

Emmanuel's form for Spurs hasn't been tested since November 9, when he was a 65th-minute substitute for Etienne Capoue in their 2-1 loss to Stoke.

After that match Adebayor criticised Spurs fans for not providing a supportive atmosphere at White Hart Lane. 

The 30-year-old is in contention to start against Hull at the KC Stadium on Sunday 

'It might be better to play away at the moment,' he said. 'At least you know you are going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing, rather than our own fans.'

Tottenham Supporters' Trust member Martin Cloake hit back at Adebayor in the  Telegraph, saying:  'Are players not playing well because of booing or is the booing because players are not playing well?' 

'It's a bit of both. Adebayor is a player on £170,000 a week. We know that he needs to be loved. But it does seem a little bit rich to be complaining that people paying between £50 and £80 to watch a single game are not being massively supportive when it doesn't appear as if all the time he is putting the effort in.' 

Adebayor has scored just twice in 12 appearances this campaign with his last goal coming in Spurs' 2-1 loss at home to Newcastle in which his side couldn't capitalise on 67 per cent of the possession.
