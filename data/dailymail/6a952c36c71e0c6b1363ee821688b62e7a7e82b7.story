As many as 40 Australian women are being groomed to become 'jihadi brides' for Islamic State militants fighting in the Middle East, where they were forced into becoming sex slaves or suicide bombers.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told parliament on Wednesday one-fifth of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq were now women.

She said 30 to 40 of these women were thought to be Australians who were supporting or engaging in terrorist activity.

'Young women are joining Daesh [Islamic State], yet they are being exploited in the most appalling way,' Ms Bishop said.

'They are being used by men who know nothing but hate, used as sexual slaves, manipulated for propaganda and recruitment purposes and in some cases ending their lives as suicide bombers.

'Many are being radicalised online, seduced by slick exploitation of social media to spread Daesh's depraved narrative.' 

The comments come after ASIO director-general Duncan Lewis confirmed the overwhelming majority of Australians who had returned home after fighting in Syria and Iraq did so more than two years ago.

'I can say that the vast majority of those 30 returned to Australia before there was even an ISIL [also known as IS], before the caliphate was declared,' Mr Lewis said.

Some had been fighting for different sides in the Syrian civil war.

Mr Lewis refused to detail the breakdown of numbers in terms of those who had returned in the past two years.

The 30 who had returned presented varying degrees of threat to the community, and were included in a 'matrix' that evaluates and prioritises the seriousness of the cases.

'We do not have a watchlist as such,' Mr Lewis said.

'We manage... the threat that is presented and the prioritising of that threat and then the attention that is given to that particular threat.'

The increase in women joining or supporting IS was a 'relatively recent phenomenon'.

It has been reported that some of the women were fighting for Islamic State, but that others were being traded as sex slaves in Syria and Iraq.

Two weeks ago, it was reported several Australian women who had gone to Syria had now become slaves of the terrorist group after their partners were killed.

The terrorist group has released a series of a recipes to help wives of jihadists look after their husbands. Above are the ingredients to make pancakes - flour, one egg, a teaspoon of salt and milk

The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them up

Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over

Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey

Ms Bishop cited the case of 22-year-old Amira Karroum, who was a former Gold Coast girl, who fled to the Middle East just before Christmas and died in fighting in Syria.

'Her death was not martyrdom, it was a tragic senseless loss,' she said. 

The government is looking at ways to counter Islamic State propaganda after it was revealed terrorists are serving up pancake recipes online to win over new followers.

A national security review report has revealed terror groups such as Islamic State are using 'highly targeted messages to appeal to vulnerable audiences'.

The report gives the example of IS releasing a pancake recipe 'designed to feed jihadists after a hard day of fighting'.

A rough translation of the recipe website says the pancakes are quickly and easily prepared and best eaten with honey.

'Can supply to mujahideen [fighters] before scurrying out onto the fighting fronts and extend the mujahideen energy and power, God willing.

'Serve them to heroes.'

The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour

Terrorist wives  are told to take the pips out of the dates and melt the butter

Take the remains of the dates and add the butter then combine with the flour

Cooks then need to role the mixture into the tiny balls before they are ready for their IS fighter husbands

Prime Minister Tony Abbott detailed the terror groups' ploys on Monday during a landmark national security address.

IS has also released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'.

'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says.

The federal government is looking at ways to counter such propaganda, in consultation with Islamic communities.

Islamic State first issued the pancake recipes in 2014 along with a recipe for balls of date mush.

They instructed the pancakes should be made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour.

IS have published cartoon videos aimed at encouraging more women to join their cause

The group strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'

Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water.

'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says. 

The cookbook was published by the Zora Foundation, an arm of IS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq.

Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far.

IS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'.

Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further.
