Some experts are predicting that Kate and William will end up with twins – and if they do, there could be more than just the usual parenting headaches ahead for the royal couple.

No mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in Britain since the 15th century – so nobody is quite sure what will happen if Kate makes history and produces a brace of infants next summer.

And if she does, the intriguing question is: which of the children will end up on the throne?

Normally, of course, this would be 
little cause for discussion during a royal pregnancy. But the 
debilitating symptoms currently suffered by Kate in the King Edward VII 
Hospital in central London point to hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition 
experienced slightly more often by women expecting twins.

If it did prove to be the case that 
Kate was carrying two children, and she gave birth to them naturally, 
the rule of primogeniture that has dictated the royal succession for 
centuries would mean that if the twins are boys, the first-born would 
ascend the throne.

And until recently, if the twins were boy and girl, 
it would be the boy who got to wear the crown. But under new 
legislation, if Kate gives birth to a mixed pair, it will be the 
first-born who succeeds – no matter their gender.

All that seems straightforward. But 
if Kate were to require either an emergency or an elective caesarean, 
then things get very much more complicated.

Last year, Crown Princess Mary of 
Denmark – the wife of the country’s next monarch – gave birth to twins.

There was 
some anxiety beforehand that her babies might have to be delivered by 
caesarean section, leading to speculation that it would be the 
obstetrician who chose which child to deliver first and thus in which order they would be in line to the throne after their elder siblings.

Happily, she didn’t have to go 
through with a caesarean section birth, and gave birth to Prince 
Vincent 25 minutes ahead of his sister, 
Princess Josephine.

Were those circumstances to arise 
here and a caesarean be required, the task of picking who would be the 
future king or queen would fall, in theory, to Alan Farthing – the royal
gynaecologist still better known as the former fiance of murdered BBC 
presenter Jill Dando.

Mr Farthing, 47, now a distinguished 
figure in the world of obstetrics, has held the royal post since 2008, 
and experienced himself the joy of fatherhood for the first time early 
last year when his wife Janet, 33, gave birth to a boy.

But while he will be more than 
prepared for the challenges ahead, it’s unlikely Mr Farthing would want 
to shoulder the responsibility of choosing whom he brought into the 
world first. Which begs the question – who would?

Would it be William, who’s expected, 
like most modern fathers, to be present  at the birth? Would the royal 
family have to revert to the odd practices of yesteryear, where a 
government minister had to be present at the accouchement to act as an 
observer and ensure everything was above board?

Last time that happened to a future 
monarch was in 1926, when the present Queen was born and home secretary 
Sir William Joynson-Hicks was required to be present, albeit in an 
adjoining room. Should that be the case again next year the job will 
fall to Theresa May, the present home secretary.

If Kate and William really are set for double joy, there are various unusual factors to expect.

Around 12,000 twin births occur each year, with around 200 triplet births and a handful of higher order births.

These
numbers have been on the increase since 1980, thanks to factors 
including the use of fertility drugs, assisted conception techniques and
even maternal age (older mothers are more likely to conceive 
multiples).

Non-identical twins are created when a
woman produces two eggs at the same time and both are fertilised, each 
by a different sperm. The fertilised egg is called a zygote, and these 
non-identical twins are known as dizygotic or fraternal twins. The 
babies are no more alike than any other brothers or sisters.

Identical
twins occur in about A third of multiple pregnancies. Known as 
monozygotic twins, a single egg is fertilised splits into two (or, very 
rarely, three or more) creating identical babies with the same genes, 
features and sex. They may or may not share a placenta. Characteristics 
such as size and personality depend on non-genetic factors, so may 
differ.

Triplets and 
higher order multiples are formed this way too, but you may have a set 
of triplets where two are identical and one is not.

Faced with the prospect of choosing 
which twin became the heir, the Cambridges would be able to consider 
various precedents set when similar situations have arisen.

Their friend the Marquess of 
Cholmondeley faced such a situation three years ago when his twin sons 
were born by caesarean. In the end, his ancient title went to his 
first-born, Alexander, who now bears his father’s courtesy title Earl of
Rocksavage; his twin is more simply known as Lord Oliver Cholmondeley.

What Kate and Wills can’t do is draw 
on any recent experience in either family tree, for there’s almost no 
history of twins in William’s extended family, and a trawl back through 
Kate’s rich and varied ancestry comes up with very few examples – and 
none in recent times.

Should Kate actually prove to be 
carrying twins, though, she will hope they  find better fortune than the
last pair of royal infants. In 1430, King James I  of Scotland’s wife 
Queen Joan gave birth to two boys. The first, Alexander, was named as 
the heir to the throne and given the title Duke of Rothesay – a title  
still carried today by William’s father as Prince of Wales.

The second twin, James, would have 
expected an easy life – except that within a year his elder brother had 
died and he assumed the Rothesay title. By the time he was six, his 
father had been assassinated and he rose unsteadily to the Scottish 
throne as King James II of Scotland.

We no longer live in such unsettled 
times, but for William and Kate, there will still be an element of 
uncertainty – until they know for certain whether they have twins on the
way or not.
