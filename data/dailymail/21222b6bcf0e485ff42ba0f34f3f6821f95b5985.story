One chef is giving a new meaning to pot roasts by creating a range of cannabis-infused dishes. 

Mary Jean Dunsdon, who hosts cookery show, Baking A Fool Of Myself has made a name for herself online for her sultry Nigella-Lawson style delivery and presentation. 

With the help of her elderly mother, the 35-year-old, who goes by the name Watermelon, uses weed to tempt taste buds with everything from marijuana-infused ice cream and burgers to margaritas.

The chef has been cooking pot-infused treats for more than 13 years.

'There is still a stereotype of marijuana smokers as a dumb surfer guy or a gangster but it's just not the case any more,' she said.

'The marijuana market is growing rapidly, I think its going to be the new money.

'Marijuana is the new medicine, it's the new recreation, it's the new booze, marijuana is already a massive market.

'Marijuana is the hero that's coming to save the day.

'It's coming to save nana from morphine and shrinking cancerous tumours.'

Watermelon has been at the forefront of campaigns to legalise recreational marijuana in Vancouver, Canada - which has 61 medicinal marijuana dispensaries.

She has her own online cooking show Baking A Fool of Myself where she demonstrates her recipes

Watermelon launched her show on YouTube in 2002 and currently has over 5,000 subscribers who watch her cook and bake with marijuana

The plant's use became legal in Canada in 2000, allowing users to grow the plant for medically approved use only.

The current law requires that patients buy their marijuana from producers approved by the federal government.

Since launching her show on YouTube, in 2002, Watermelon has been attracting attention from all over the world and currently has over 5,000 subscribers. 

She said: 'People have responded so well to the show. The first question is what blender do I use, the second is usually, "will you marry me?".

'I started smoking pot in my 20s and got involved in baking when I moved back from from New York.

'My friend had a bag of marijuana in the basement and I decided to bake up a batch of pot cookies.

'I took them to the beach and sold every single one and realised the demand for them was high.

Smoking hot: For Watermelon, mainstream acceptance has been a long road  

'I see the marijuana industry going super mainstream.'

Watermelon's mother, Mary Elizabeth Dunsdon, 72, taught her how to bake and  assists her daughter in the kitchen.

Mary Elizabeth said: 'I grew up in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and to me, only gangsters did anything with drugs.

'When Watermelon started baking with marijuana I went out and bought a big fat book on cannabis so I could understand it better and feel comfortable helping her.

'She educated me about how to use it and I saw that it's not about going out and getting stoned.'

However, for Watermelon, mainstream acceptance has been a long road.

She said: 'Back when I started out with the show everybody was like wow, that's really sweet, but totally inappropriate for television.

'We were ahead of our time and have just been waiting for the world to catch up.'

Watermelon,who has drawn comparisons with Nigella Lawson's provocative approach to cooking, sells her baked goods to ten legal marijuana dispensaries in Vancouver.

She said: 'For years I sold every cookie at the end of my hand but now we're a wholesale business.

'I'm having a hard time keeping up - every problem I have is a good problem.

'The demand is so high - I just have to figure out how I can make more of my product, faster and better.'

And the glamour girl is a pin-up for weed aficionados everywhere posing for sexy snaps among crops of marijuana.

She said: 'I met with photographer Maria Coletsis 14 years ago and we've been shooting almost every year since.

'We've done characters like Jungle Mary Jane, Little Miss Puff-it, Cleo-pot-ra - we've done them all.

'Marijuana is doing a world of good.

'There's such a beautiful spectrum, this umbrella of marijuana that's about to open up to the world.

'It's going to be an exciting time with a lot of giggly people and that can't be too bad.'

The debate over the legalisation of marijuana continues in Canada - and government anti-drug campaigns have been a focus of the discussion.

Health Canada's ads targeted young people and were claiming that the use could lead to impaired concentration, cause hallucinations and lower IQ.

The debate is also in full swing across the United States - where recreational use is now legal in Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and Alaska.
