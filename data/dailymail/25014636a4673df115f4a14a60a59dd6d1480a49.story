A herd of dairy cows nearly lifted the roof off their barn in central Germany when methane released by the animals caused an explosion.

Police in Hesse state said in a statement that a static electric charge apparently triggered the detonation, and a spurt of flame, on Monday at a farm in Rasdorf.

The roof was slightly damaged and one cow suffered light burns - no-one was hurt.Â

Police say 90 cows are kept in the shed and it wasn't clear why quantities of methane had built up.

Bovine belching and flatulence releases large quantities of the gas.

An economist Portsmouth University revealed a herd of cows produces more greenhouse gas in a year than a family car produces to drive 3,000 miles.

Dr Andy Thorpe said that 200 cows expel an annual amount of methane equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of a car burning 21,400 litres of petrol.

Dr Thorpe added that while CO2 emissions have increased by 31 per cent in the past 250 years, methane has increased by 149 per cent over the same period.

Methane has a greater warming effect than CO2 and a longer lifetime in the atmosphere. He said the gas is responsible for one fifth of global warming experienced since 1750.

Between 55 per cent and 70 per cent of methane produced comes from man-made sources, mostly farming of animals such as cows, sheep and goats, which have an additional stomach and produce large amounts of methane as they digest food.

Dr Thorpe said: 'Methane emission-growth, like CO2 growth, has been increasing exponentially in the developing world due to a rise in incomes leading to an increased demand for meat, and the "hamburger connection" where developing countries make a lucrative profit supplying meat to developed countries.'

He explained that up to 75 per cent of animal methane emissions came from developing countries, with India and Brazil being the leading producers.

Efforts are being made to reduce emissions, including providing different feed and using vaccinations, but they are in the early stages of research.

Dr Thorpe, whose research is published in the journal Climatic Change, warned there could be problems with downsizing herds.

A reduction in meat could lead to a 'disastrous' increase in demand for fish and cereals.
