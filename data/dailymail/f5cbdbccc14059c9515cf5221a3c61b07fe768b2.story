Mark Jenkins, 45, has been jailed for five years after he took £1.4million from 42 homeowners without finishing the work

A cowboy builder was paid £1.4million by a string of customers but ended up leaving their homes looking like 'bomb sites'.

Mark Jenkins, 45, was today jailed for five years after using a number of aliases to target homeowners in Bristol, North Somerset and South Wales between September 2011 and April this year.

Bristol Crown Court heard Jenkins, of Caerphilly, South Wales, demanded large sums of money up front and regularly failed to complete work. 

Jenkins splashed out on expensive Porsche cars and gambling while his victims were left suffering 'immense stress', with some forced to take out loans to resolve half-finished renovations. 

Police estimate the total loss to victims as around £830,000, though Jenkins, who admitted a charge of fraudulent trading, insists it is in the region of £573,000.  

A jury heard Jenkins was declared bankrupt and jailed following an identical rogue builder fraud in 2009 - but simply changed his name to avoid detection after serving his sentence.

He since took £1.4 million from 42 homeowners in Cardiff, Methyr Tydfil, Clevedon, Weston-super-Mare and Bristol, promising he could deliver their 'dream kitchen or extension'. 

Judge Graham Hume Jones sentenced Jenkins to five years in prison and told him the most serious part of the offending was the impact caused to victims.

He said: 'They tell of saving for years to be able to afford their dream kitchen or the extension to enable an elderly relative to end their life in family surroundings only to be left with what has been described in certain circumstances as a bomb site, with their money from saving gone.

'They tell of immense pressure put on marriages and family relationships and relationships with neighbours.

'These are the most serious factors of this case and there are little or no mitigating factors.'

Jenkins, who showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, asked for 22 other offences to be taken into consideration.

The judge said Jenkins changed his name from Mark Killick and also used the name Mark Richards to restart the fraud after serving time in prison.

His firms, Pro-Fit Builders and XL Builders and Trade Bookers, claimed to secure trade discount and offered competitive prices to draw customers in.

He advertised on the RatedPeople.com website, which features recommended tradesmen from across the UK, and people trusted him to be reliable.

'You asked for substantial upfront deposits,' the judge told Jenkins, who spent £62,000 on gambling websites over a three-year period.

Jenkins asked his targets for 'substantial' deposits as high as £20,000 before beginning work on their homes. One homeowner returned to find plastic sheeting and wires poking out from their kitchen tiles 

'The work started and then slowed down or stopped. But your customers were too far in.

'If they pulled out they were frightened they would lose their money and if they paid more they would be paying good money into bad.

'You told them you had a substantial skilled workforce but in fact you were a one man band.'

Many of his victims attended court and wept as personal impact statements were read.

One woman, from Fishponds, Bristol, who paid a £20,000 deposit for an extension, said: 'Mark Jenkins left me with a shell on the side of my house and he has ruined my life.'

Another customer, from Merthyr Tydfil, who gave a £17,000 deposit for an extension said the fraud had brought his marriage 'to the brink of collapse'.

'We are now living with a constant reminder of his deceit and our gullibility,' the victim said.

'He will have a lasting effect upon our family and we will suffer financially for 10 years.'

One Cardiff man paid Jenkins an £18,500 deposit to build an annexe at his home for his terminally ill grandmother.

'As my grandmother's health deteriorated I had to constantly say the work was continuing and she knew she was near the end and wanted to spend her final days and weeks at home as she did not want to be in hospital,' he said.

'She died in hospital and her final words were "When can I come home?"'

Avon and Somerset Police and National Trading Standards Scambusters teams spent nine months investigating Jenkins after several customers in Bristol realised they had been conned by the same builder.

Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Adam Smith described the 'tremendous distress and disappointment' Jenkins' victims suffered.

In other cases the fraudster left wiring exposed and did not properly fit plug sockets to the walls as shown

Exposed wiring and messy handiwork were hallmarks of the damage caused by Jenkins to the homes of his targets 

'The victims had their dreams and expectations of seeing their homes improved dashed, by the callous actions of a ruthless fraudster, who has been found out,' DS Smith said.

Lord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards, said reputable trading websites could be duped by fraudsters posing as legitimate traders.

'Jenkins' deceptive and dishonest tactics left many of his victims financially and emotionally scarred and I am delighted to see that justice has been served,' Lord Harris added.

Southwest Scambusters manager, Jonathan Martin, added: 'This successful prosecution, bringing justice for dozens of residents, is thanks to a targeted investigation across a number of authorities over a number of years. 

'Mark Jenkins was hooked on his particular kind of building scam and has brought misery and hardship to those he conned.'

One of Jenkins' victims, who paid him £42,000 for an extension in Bristol, said she would appeal the sentence.

'The sentence is not high enough,' she said. 'He left us high and dry. It was still a building site. He is very, very good at what he does as a conman.'
