Roma gipsy immigrants are illegally marrying underage girls as young as 12 before bringing them to the UK to live.

Girls as young as 12 and 13 are regularly being married off in exchange for thousands of pounds in countries including Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary before being brought to Britain.

The former deputy leader of Rotherham Council, where more than 1,400 schoolgirls were sexually exploited by Asian gangs, made the revelation at a meeting this week.

It has prompted calls for an urgent investigation into how many child brides are living in Britain's estimated 250,000-strong Roma community.

The arranged marriages of girls under 16 is common in Roma communities, where families follow the Gypsy code Pachiv which encourages girls to marry soon after reaching puberty. 

The code dictates that the head of the large family group is always obeyed and in some cases large sums of money can be involved when matchmakers seek out a suitable young girl for marriage. 

During a meeting of the full council in Rotherham this week, Independent councillor Martyn Parker repeatedly questioned former deputy leader Emma Hoddinott over the claims.

Cllr Hoddinott finally admitted there are illegal brides in the town's large Eastern European immigrant community, adding it was 'unacceptable'. 

Cllr Parker said : 'On the Roma community you're not answering my questions. I've asked five times now and you're still avoiding it.

'I asked are there any people in the Roma community in Rotherham married to underage children - that's under 16-years-old. 'We need a bit of honesty for the people of Rotherham or we will go nowhere.'

Cllr Hoddinott replied: 'It's a simple answer - yes, children are being married underage and that is unacceptable. 

'We have to work with police to tackle that and we have to work with the commissioners to make sure there are actions in place to tackle these issues.

'Underage marriage is an issue in Rotherham and we have to tackle that. Part of that is understanding how we tackle it.

'We need to get it right - we can't write off those girls because they are in that community.'

But she said she was unable to say how many children in the town might be married to men already.

But Cllr Parker said: 'You say you can't get the information, but a passport has marital status on it. If you're concerned about a child then you can get that information from the police - saying you can't answer is unacceptable.

'If they're here legally then they're here on a passport and the police can find out.'

Speaking after the meeting he said: 'Officially in Rotherham there are 6,500 Roma gypsies but unofficially it is more like 7,500.

'I believe there are young Roma girls who come over here already married. They couldn't possibly legally marry here.

'But when I have asked for information I have been told that it is not possible to find out but I believe council officials should be looking into this.

'We have already got the child sexual exploitation scandal in Rotherham and I don't want us in five or ten years time to have the same situation with this.

'Just because a child is allowed to marry at the age of 12 or 13 in another country doesn't mean we have to change our laws to accommodate that. We have one law which should be fairly implemented for everyone who lives here wherever they have come from. 

Two damning reports into child sex abuse in Rotherham revealed that more than 1,400 young girls were groomed, trafficked and abused by gangs of mostly Pakistani men over a 16-year period.

Police and the town's Labour Council were accused of covering up the abuse. 

The Government has since appointed commissioners to take over running of the scandal-hit council. 

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'South Yorkshire Police is committed to tackling issues of underage and forced marriage.

'Part of our strategy for tackling issues of forced marriage is that we consider the benefits of working in partnership locally and nationally.

'Because forced marriage is often a hidden and under-reported crime, we recognise within South Yorkshire that there is a need to develop creative and flexible ways to break down any barriers and to encourage full and active engagement with local agencies, communities and groups.

'Information regarding forced marriage issues can be received from various sources and involve sensitive and complex issues. Therefore within South Yorkshire Police we have specially trained officers who deal with such matters, such as domestic violence officers, and child protection officers.

'We would encourage any victim of forced marriage to come forward and report it to police, in the confidence that they will be listened to, that they will be taken seriously and that a thorough investigation will take place.'

Anyone with information about underage or forced marriage is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
