A four-year-old girl has a rare genetic condition that makes her so fragile even a gust of wind can knock her over.

Abbi Bennett, suffers from a muscle-wasting condition that affects just one in a million babies. It means that although she can walk a little, the slightest touch can send her tumbling over.

On one occasion the four-year-old, from Bournville, Birmingham, was blown down by a gust of wind while with her mother Sarah at a supermarket.

Abbi was diagnosed with a genetic condition when she was two, which affects just one in a million people

Mrs Bennett, 32, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when a gust of 
wind knocked her over. We had arrived at the supermarket and I’d put her
down for just a few seconds to get my bag out the car, when there was 
this gust of wind.

'The next thing I knew she fell and hit 
her head on the floor and was bleeding. I was shocked at how easily she 
went over. It left her very scared of wind for a while afterwards.

'We have to be so careful around her, making sure she doesn’t fall over and hurt herself.

'She can just about walk 10 metres, but if there is a bumpy surface she can collapse.

'At first she suffered some nasty falls,
bumping her head. However, over time she has learned to take the brunt 
of any falls on her knees. A lot of people don’t realise she has a
disability as she looks normal so they won’t think anything of brushing
past her. But Abbi cannot keep her balance and they will knock her 
over.'

Abbi was diagnosed with the muscle-wasting condition Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD) at the age of two.

The condition, which is linked to Muscular Dystrophy, affects just one in a million babies. It not only leaves her frail, but she has bendiness in the joints of her hands and feet and she suffers from curvature of the spine and has respiratory weakness.

Sarah, a psychology student and 
husband Gary, 32, a learning mentor, realised there was something wrong 
with their daughter soon after she was born.

But as so little is known about UCMD, it took two years for them to get a diagnosis.

Sarah, who also has Ashleigh, 12, 
Amber, six, and two-year-old Ava, said: 'I knew there was something 
different about her after having two other children, I could tell. Her 
feet could touch her shins and she was super flexible, which we know now
is part of the disease’s symptoms.

'But
there were other clues. She struggled to hold her own body weight as 
she got older. We were in and out of the doctors for two years as her 
weight also fluctuated.

'She was never able to crawl and when she did eventually start walking at 18 months old, it was more like a waddle and then she’d fall over.'

It was only after the family was referred to specialist Helen Roper at the Birmingham Children’s Hospital that Abbi was diagnosed.

'She spotted it straight away,' Sarah said.

'When we found out it was UCMD it hit us hard. I thought my world was over. I started looking it up on the internet but there wasn’t a lot of information about at the time.

Out and about: Abbi can walk about 10metres but will end up completely wheel-chair bound as her condition worsens

'Gary worked at a special needs school and knew about two brothers who had the Duchenne’s version of the illness which only affects boys, so he had an idea of what muscular dystrophy was.

'Luckily UCMD doesn’t affect the heart like Duchenne’s but Abbi has all the other symptoms and problems.

'It will mean in a few years that she will become totally reliant on a wheelchair when her muscles will no longer be able to cope. She will also suffer respiratory problems.

'There is no cure at the moment for Abbi’s condition as so little is known about it. But there is a clinical trial that will take place which will investigate UCMD.

'Our aim now is to raise as much awareness as we can about the disease, so that the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign can use the money to help other parents and continue ground-breaking research.

'We have started up our own charity committee on Facebook called Abbi’s Campaign - 1 in a Million, where funds raised will go towards the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign.'

Sarah added: 'We’ve met other UCMD sufferers, but there are only three that we know of in the UK. We hope a cure will be found.

'Abbi will need continuous support for the rest of her life and we want people out there to know that this condition does exist.'
