It looks like a scene from a horror movie.

A hatchet hurtled off the back of a truck and sliced through the windshield of a car traveling behind it this morning, resting just inches from the front-seat passenger's face.

The terrifying incident unfolded on Interstate 95 in Topsfield, Massachusetts about 11am.

'The passenger was shaken up (who wouldnâ€™t be?) but not injured,' Massachusetts State Police wrote on their Facebook page.

Terrifying: A hatchet hurtled off the back of a landscaper's dump truck and sliced into the windshield of a car traveling behind it on the Interstate 95 in Topsfield, Massachusetts on Wednesday

A photo shared by police online shows that the axe's head landed on the car's dashboard next to the air conditioning vent - not far from where the unidentified passenger sat.

Newbury Barracks Trooper Joseph Risteen who attended the scene fined the truck driver, from Peabody, $200 for failing to secure cargo.

Cops said the damage was minimal because the car was not speeding.

'We are very thankful that this situation did not have a worse ending,' cops said in the Facebook posting.
