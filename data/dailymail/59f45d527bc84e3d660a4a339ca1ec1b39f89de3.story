The parents of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl recovering after a double lung transplant have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and she has since had a second transplant.

Sarah Murnaghan’s parents said Friday that their daughter had received the second transplant within days of the first failing and she has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths.

'We’re not out of the woods, but Sarah’s health is trending in the right direction and we wanted to provide more detailed information as to what she has been going through,' the family said in a statement.

The parents of Sarah Murnaghan have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and has since had a second transplant

Sarah suffers from late-stage cystic fibrosis, and her parents battle to be allowed an organ transplant provoked a national debate after she was initially denied one on the grounds that she was too young.

Eventually they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult lungs because of the severity of her illness, rather than her age.

Sarah suffered a ‘code blue’ emergency after the June 12 transplant of a first set of donor lungs at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia failed and she was placed on machines.

Within three days, on June 15, a new set of lungs became available, her parents said. Those organs were infected with pneumonia, but the family agreed to take them because the organs represented Sarah’s last chance at life.

The child underwent a second surgery on June 21, after which she was awakened from a medically induced coma.

The family, who had been so public about Sarah's situation, acknowledged they withheld details of her status.

'It was only then that we could allow ourselves to feel real hope and being posting some information on Facebook about Sarah’s progress,' the family statement said.

Only days ago the parents released a statement saying their daughter was recovering slowly and in 'a lot more pain' without being more specific about what had happened.

Progress: Sarah's parents say she has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths

'Tougher 24 hours. We are weening (sic) sedation and some pain meds to make Sarah more awake in preparation for extubation, but she is in a lot more pain', her mother Janet Ruddock Murnaghan wrote in a Facebook post today.

'It's
a BIG thing for such a little girl, but we know she can do it! Praising
God for all the progress', NBCnews.com reported her mother saying.

After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months.

Family spokeswoman Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since last Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding.

According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because the tube is keeping her form speaking.

Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare.

She is making rapid progress. Two days 
earlier she was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine and is now 
using a traditional ventilator.

Sarah's plight sparked a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 
'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29
about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous 
but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child 
about a week to live, and they were out of options.

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

The Murnaghans scored a
major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said
that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th..

The
ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has
been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

Lung
transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children 
fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, 
said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone 
Medical Center.

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on 
the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 
11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
