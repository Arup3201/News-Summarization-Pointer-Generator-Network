Toby Alderweireld knows Southampton need to beat Burnley this weekend if they are to maintain their push for European football.

A summer of despair at St Mary's has been followed by a quite remarkable season, leaving Saints sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining.

Last weekend's 1-1 draw at Chelsea boosted their hopes of European qualification - a match in which Alderweireld performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury.

It was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the Belgium international knows Saints have to follow it up with a win at home to Burnley on Saturday.

Toby Alderweireld is keen for Southampton to keep winning to maintain the push for Europe 

'It was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again,' Alderweireld said. 'With a bit of luck, a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point.

'It's important we don't look too far in the future because it won't help. We can be happy with the point at Chelsea, but if we lose on Saturday what does it mean?

'We want to achieve something good, something special this season, so we have to win. That's game by game. We can't play a different game on Saturday, it's Burnley.

'We really want to achieve something very special for Southampton. We have nine games, nine finals; we have very tough games left.

'Let's get the three points with the supporters on Saturday, that's the first final.'

Burnley arrive at St Mary's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend's win against champions Manchester City.

Sean Dyche's men also got the better of Saints when they met earlier in the campaign and Alderweireld is eyeing revenge.

'It's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood, they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence,' he told Southampton's official YouTube channel.

'But at home, we need to win. We can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had, we have to do that, especially at home.

'We have to be patient, show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter.

'In the last game we deserved to win I think. We had the better chances and they had none really.

'We had the throw-in and then they scored, it was very unlucky. We could have won there so we want to get a little revenge.

'They have a lot of good players. That's the Premier League. When you're not 100 per cent, anyone can beat you, that's what people like about the Premier League.

'We have to be 100 per cent. They are in a good mood so we have to be at our best.

'I don't think this group is over confident. We are focused and we know we have to show the quality on the ball.'
