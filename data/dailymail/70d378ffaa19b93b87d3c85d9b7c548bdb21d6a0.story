Curtis Woodhouse has retired from boxing just weeks after losing his British light welterweight title.

The
 former Premier League midfielder lost to Willie Limond in Glasgow, 
having won the belt from Darren Hamilton earlier this year.

Woodhouse, 34, hangs up his gloves with a record of 22 wins from his 29 fights.

‘I've had an unbelievable ride, for eight and a half years I've been in with some of best Britain's got to offer,’ he told Sky Sports.

‘After my last fight and losing my British title I realised not long after that that it was time for me to step away from the game.

‘I didn't want to stay in there and take unnecessary punishment. I just believe I got in and achieved everything I wanted to achieve and believe now is the perfect time for me to walk away with my head held high and my chest out and pride to my achievements.’

Great story: Woodhouse completed his journey from Premier League footballer to British boxing champion

Woodhouse played almost 400 games for 10 clubs including Sheffield United and Birmingham City before making the transition to boxing.

He made his debut in 2006 and won the English title six years later only to lose two of his next four fights.

But two low-key points wins set him up for a shot at Hamilton in February and he stunned the champion in Hull.

Woodhouse
 initially retired after that bout having picked up £250,000 from a 
£5,000 bet he placed on himself becoming British champion when he turned
 professional.

But
 he went to the well one more time in a bid to add Limond’s Commonwealth
 title to his collection, only to be knocked down twice en-route to 
defeat.
