A high school soccer player was lured from his house and gunned down in his own front yard after returning home from a game.

Francisco Javier Rodriguez Jr, 17, was murdered after he answered his front door in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.

Relatives claim a red-haired woman was seen in his yard shortly before the killing

Two suspects Jason Schumann, 24, and Elizabeth Ibarra, 19, were arrested on Monday on suspicion of murder. They are being held on a $1 million bail.

Suspects: Elizabeth Ibarra, 19, and Jason Schuman, 24, have been 
arrested on suspicion of murdering Francisco Javier Rodriguez, 17

Slain: Francisco Rodriguez Jr., 17, was shot in his own front yard after being lured outside by a red-haired woman

Police believe Ibarra lured 
Rodriguez, who was a goalie at El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills, into the front yard when he was shot.

They claim that she dyed her hair brown after the killing on January 11.

Investigators have said Rodriguez's murder was not random, but 
'personally motivated' and resulted in numerous tips, Deputy Chief Jorge
Villegas said.

Pain: Justine Villalobo, a cousin of Francisco Rodriguez weeps at a memorial to the boy outside the Rodriguez home, Friday

Suspicious: Relatives said the boy was killed after answering the door and stepping outside, where a red-haired woman had been seen

'There's a specific anonymous tip 
that came to us and we need that person to come forward, identify 
himself or herself, and provide us with additional information that we 
need to solidify this case,' Mr Villegas said at a news conference 
attended by the victim's family.

Ibarra's record includes forgery, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and identity theft. Both are on probation.

Family's morn: Francisco's cousins, left to right, Mary Salazar, Nancy Ortega and Jannette Nuno cry outside the Rodriguez home Thursday

Investigation: Picking up the pieces throughout the family's morning, authorities say one of the murder suspects, Ibarra, dyed her hair dark brown following the shooting possibly connecting her to the red head seen

The murder weapon has not yet been recovered, Villegas said.

Police declined to reveal whether Rodriguez knew either suspect.

Authorities would only say there was a 'significant relationship' between Schumann and Ibarra.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder.

Rodriguez's family said he had no gang affiliation and his life centered on soccer.

Days before the shooting, Rodriguez came back home from a soccer tournament in Hawaii where he had spent a week and a half.

Schumann's record includes assault with a deadly weapon, battery, narcotics violations and forgery.

Ibarra's record includes forgery, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and identity theft. Both are on probation.

Connection: Rodriguez's family said their son had no gang affiliation and his life centered on soccer though police believe his killing wasn't random but personally motivated
