Lynette Brimble suffered severe head and other injuries when she was hit head on by a car along the dark road

A pensioner was killed when she tried to 'shoo' away an injured goose from a country road, an inquest has heard.

Lynette Brimble, a former professional actress and health service accountant, suffered severe head and other injuries when she was hit head on by a car along the dark road.

A coroner said the mother-of-two, originally from St Andrews, in Scotland, died as a result of a road traffic collision and said: 'It is one of the most unusual cases I have heard of.'

The Plymouth inquest heard that 67-year-old Mrs Brimble was driving home after watching a play with her neighbour Ann Clough when they spotted the Canadian goose in their lane on the A377 near Crediton, Devon, last July.

Mrs Clough said in a statement to Plymouth and south Devon coroner Ian Arrow that they saw a large brown mottled Canadian goose sitting on their side of the road which appeared to be injured but alive.

They turned around and the goose was still sitting in the lane of the 60mph road.

She said Mrs Brimble, who lived in Lapford, Devon, repeatedly flashed her headlights at an oncoming car which she had seen in the pitch black road where there were no street lights.

She then got out of the car while Mrs Clough stayed in the passenger seat.

Her neighbour said Mrs Brimble was ‘half in, half out’ of her Citreon Zara car as she flashed the lights three times.

'The next thing I knew the oncoming car had hit Lynette. I heard a bang and saw her flying down the road.'

Mrs Brimble was seriously hurt and lying in the road while Mrs Clough held her hand and talked to her as police and ambulance crews arrived at the scene.

She said a policeman shooed away the goose but she added that she could not say how quickly the black Ford Focus was being driven.

The car driver, grandmother Ellen Pope, said she only saw the victim in front of her saying: 'I knew I was going to hit her, I had nowhere to go.'

The coroner heard she donated some of her organs which her son said had helped three other people

The traumatised driver said she could have done nothing to avoid the collision.

Mrs Pope told Mrs Brimble’s son Alastair: 'I am so sorry for your pain. She was a really lovely lady.'

Mr Brimble replied that they all had to ‘find a way through these things’ and said it was an accident.

MPC Marcus Rowe told the inquest that the car was on the proper side of the road and Mrs Brimble was in the car’s carriageway when she was hit.

He said: 'She was nearer the white line than the verge.'

He estimated her speed at between 25mph and 39mph at the time of the impact.

Motor Patrol Sergeant Richard Newton said Mrs Pope did not see Mrs Brimble’s stationary car flashing its headlights and said she had not committed any offences.

He said: 'It was something she could not avoid.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of a road traffic collision saying Mrs Brimble was ‘endeavouring to move the goose from the road’.

He said as she ‘tried to shoo the goose off the road, aware of the oncoming car, unfortunately the driver of the black Ford Focus was unable to reach fast enough once she had seen her to stop.

'It is extremely sad. It is one of the most unusual cases I have heard of.'

The inquest heard Mrs Brimble was transferred to a Plymouth hospital where she died five days after the collision. 

The coroner heard she donated some of her organs which her son said had helped three other people.
