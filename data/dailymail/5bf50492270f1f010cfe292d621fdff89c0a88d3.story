The State Department has only 'advised' Americans against traveling to the Libyan city of Benghazi even after Britain, Germany and the Netherlands today urged their citizens to immediately leave the in response to what was described as an imminent threat against Westerners.

The U.S. pointed to a travel advisory issued earlier this month and did not strengthen its warning even after the European countries issued statements variously describing the threat as specific and imminent but none gave details as to its exact nature.

Today sources within the British department linked an 
al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) to the latest threats who are an offshoot to the terrorists responsible for last week's hostage crisis in Algeria that ended with the deaths of 37 Westerners and 29 Islamists, the Independent reports.

The threat is also said by the department to 
be potentially linked to one of Aqim's runoff groups in Libya, Ansar 
Al-Sharia, which fled Benghazi after the September 11 attack on the U.S. 
consulate in Benghazi last year that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens.

The warnings come a day after U.S. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testified to Congress about 
that deadly attack that also killed four Americans. It also comes while French troops battle 
al-Qaida linked militants in Mali.

The State Department tried to downplay the terror threat, insisting there is 'no specific information pointing to specific, imminent threats against U.S. citizens.'

But the government did say that threat of kidnapping and targeted violence remains 'significant.'

They also added in the latest warning that Americans should, 'review personal safety plans, remain aware of surroundings, 
including local events, and monitor local news stations for updates.

'Maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance
 your personal security.'

Germany and Britain urged their nationals still in Benghazi to leave 'immediately' while Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Thijs van Son said that 'staying in this area is not to be advised.'

It was not immediately clear how many people could be affected; Britain's Foreign Office said likely 'dozens' of its citizens were in the city, while Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Thijs van Son said there are four Dutch citizens registered as being in Benghazi and possibly two more. 

Secretary of State Clinton testified at Congress yesterday about the deadly Sept. 11 terror attack that killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others.

Several countries have for months advised against all travel to the city, especially after the U.S. consulate was attacked, and local residents said that many foreigners had already left in recent weeks.

Benghazi, a city of 1 million people, is a business hub where many major firms employ Westerners. It also was where the Libyan uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi began in 2011.

Gadhafi was eventually toppled and killed after NATO backed the rebel movement, and the Arab country has since struggled with security. Al-Qaida-linked militants operate in the country alongside other Islamist groups.

Adel Mansouri, principal of the International School of Benghazi, said British and foreign nationals were warned two days ago about a possible threat to Westerners.

He said the school's teachers were given the option of leaving but decided to stay. The school has some 540 students. Most are Libyan with some 40 percent who hold dual nationality.

US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed on September 11 in Benghazi.

Less than 5 percent are British while 10 to 15 students have U.S.-Libyan nationality, Mansouri said. Classes were not due to resume until Sunday because of a holiday Thursday.

'We told the British ambassador we are staying, and we'll be in touch,' said Mansouri, himself a Libyan-British dual national. 'We don't see a threat on the ground.'

Saleh Gawdat, a Benghazi lawmaker, said French doctors who were working in Benghazi hospitals have left the city and that the French cultural center has closed out of concerns about potential retaliation over the French-led military intervention in nearby Mali, which began two weeks ago.

Violence in Benghazi has targeted both foreigners as well as Libyan officials in recent months — with assassinations, bombings and other attacks.

In addition to the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate, an Italian diplomat's car was fired on by militants in Benghazi.

The consul, Guido De Sanctis, wasn't injured in the attack earlier this month, but the incident prompted Italy to order the temporary suspension of its consular activities in the city and send its foreign staff home.

Islamist extremists are often blamed for targeting security officials who worked under Gadhafi, as a kind of revenge for torturing or imprisoning them in the past. Many city residents also blame Gadhafi loyalists who they say are trying to undermine Libya's new leaders by sowing violence.

Ibrahim Sahd, a Benghazi-based lawmaker and politician, said that the new government is putting together a plan to beef up security in the city and this 'might have worried the Westerners of a backlash.'

Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist with links to al-Qaida who is now an analyst at London's Quilliam Foundation, said other groups inspired by the terror network have been gaining a following since Gadhafi's fall. There have been nearly a dozen attacks against Western targets in Libya recently, he said.

'It's the same al-Qaida ideology that is driving these militants,' Benotman said.

He added, however, that the militants were unlikely to target oil or gas installations in Libya because they need support from the population. 'Targeting these installations would turn Libyan workers and tribes against them,' he said.

Oil companies working in other parts of Libya said they were aware of government warnings to citizens but there were no immediate plans for evacuations.
