Apology: Shop girl Elisha Ram, 23, was suspended from her work at Bentalls department store and forced to apologise after she called Chelsea star John Terry 'a pig'

A shop assistant was suspended from work and forced to apologise after she reportedly called Chelsea star John Terry 'a pig'.

Elisha Ram, 23, was working at a department store concession when the footballer and his wife Toni walked in - and overheard her telling a colleague 'he is quite good looking in real life - but he's a pig.'

Miss Ram said she was sorry, but then snapped at the defender - who asked to see her manager at Bentalls in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, to complain about her conduct.

Miss Ram was then suspended from her job at the store's All Saints concession, pending an investigation by her bosses at the high street chain.

Miss Ram said she had greeted Terry, 33, as he walked into the concession on Monday, before turning to her workmate and told them her feelings on the footballer, describing him as a pig.

The worried colleague told Miss Ram to be quiet, and she then realised the conversation had been overheard by Mrs Terry, who married the footballer in 2007 after the pair started dating as teenagers.

The footballer, who lives in nearby Oxshott, then reportedly approached Miss Ram, and told her she should not have called him a pig while his wife was present.

'I said I was really really sorry. Then I just snapped, got defensive and retaliated, saying, 'you're a disgrace,' Miss Ram's friend told The Sun's Andy Crick.

Terry then asked to see her the 
manager, reportedly telling Miss Ram's boss that he wouldn't have commented on Miss
 Ram as he did not know her, adding: 'And she doesn't know me to call 
her a pig.'

According to The Sun,
 Miss Ram told a friend that she had made the pig remark after reading 
reports which alleged Terry had cheated on his wife, who is mother to 
his twin children Georgie John and Summer Rose - who turn eight on 
Sunday.

It was claimed 
Terry had an affair with the former girlfriend of his then Chelsea 
teammate Wayne Bridge, French model Vanessa Perroncel.

She
 denied having an affair with Terry, who was stripped of the England 
captaincy following reports about their relationship in 2010, saying 
that the pair were 'friends'.

A spokesman from clothing company All Saints said it was not the brand's policy to comment on matters relating to individual staff members.

It is understood that senior shop staff sent a formal written apology to Terry, who last week signed a new 12 month deal with Chelsea, taking him to 20 years with the west London club.

A Bentalls spokesman told MailOnline that the store was unable to comment as Miss Ram was employed by All Saints and any decision as to her future would be made by the fashion chain.

A spokesman for Terry told MailOnline the star would not be commenting on the matter. 

Speaking at Miss Ram's home in Feltham, Middlesex, a woman believed to beher mother said today that she had not spoken to her daughter about the incident with Terry, and did not know what had happened at the store.

September 2001: The day after the September 11 terrorist attacks Terry, along with his then teammates Frank Lampard, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jody Morris were accused of mocking American tourists during a drinking session at Heathrow Airport. They were each fined two weeks wages.

January 2002: Terry was suspended from England duty after he was charged with assault and affray after an alleged confrontation with a nightclub doorman. He was cleared of all charges.

February 2002: CCTV footage from an Essex nightclub appeared to show the footballer urinating into a glass before dropping it on the floor. He did not comment on the claims.

March 2008: Terry was fined £60 for parking his car in a disabled bay.

January 2010: It was alleged that Terry had an affair with French model  Vanessa Perroncel, the former girlfriend of his ex-teammate Wayne Bridge. She denied the claims. Terry was stripped of the England captaincy by manager Fabio Capello, who gave the armband to fellow defender Rio Ferdinand. He was re-instated as captain the following year.

October 2011: It is claimed Terry made a racist slur against Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's defeat at QPR. He was later stripped of the England captaincy for a second time by the FA board - who did not consult Capello, prompting the manager's resignation in February 2012. Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court of making a racist insult to Ferdinand in July 2012.

July 2012: Despite being cleared by magistrates, Terry is charged by the FA with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards QPR defender Ferdinand. It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand. Terry denies the charge and requests a personal hearing. That September, after announcing his retirement from international football he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by an FA independent regulatory commission.

Terry is Chelsea's most successful captain - leading the club to three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Uefa Champions League.

During his career he has also worked with charities including Great Ormond Street Hospital and Make-A-Wish foundation.
