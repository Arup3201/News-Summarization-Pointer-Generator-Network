A Southwest Airlines flight attendant allegedly initially refused to use an automated external defibrillator (AED) on a passenger due to his chest hair.

KOAT reported that Jack Jordan, 62, suffered a heart attack on the plane. 

Spouse Caroline Jordan, who was traveling with him, told the affiliate station both a nurse and physical therapist tried using CPR - and that a flight attendant dismissed a third passenger who pointed out the defibrillator.

Victim: A Southwest Airlines flight attendant allegedly initially refused to use an automated external defibrillator (AED) on Jack Jordan, pictured, due to his chest hair

'The female flight attendant that had been there, right up there with us, said "Because his chest is too hairy,"' Jordan told KOAT.

Jordan criticized the situation, telling KOAT 'I don't expect the airlines or flight attendants to be nurses or doctors. Not anywhere close.

'But, in that kind of a circumstance, one of the first things that they should be doing is getting that AED hooked up.'

'Caroline says eventually they did shave her husband's chest and put on the device, but he died at [Albuquerque International Sunport],' KOAT reporter Nancy Laflin said in the broadcast.

Dr. Barry Ramo told KOAT defibrillator kits have tools to help remove items that get in the way.

'We extend our deepest sympathies to the passenger for her loss,' Michelle Agnew, a spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, said in an email exchange to MailOnline. 'Our reports indicate that once notified of his condition, our flight attendants and two onboard medical professionals assisted the ill passenger, following protocol for use of our onboard automated external defibrillator (AED).

'All of our aircraft are fully equipped with AEDs and our flight attendants receive initial and annual recurrent CPR and AED training. While in the air, our Employees contacted paramedics to meet the flight immediately upon arrival.'

On Sunday, Agnew told MailOnline '[W]e want to stress that our Flight Attendants did not deviate from the AED protocol due to any Customer circumstances. They were assisted by two medical professionals onboard. Once it was determined that the AED was not sufficient, they followed protocol and began to administer CPR. Paramedics met the flight upon arrival.'
