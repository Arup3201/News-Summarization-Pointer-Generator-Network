With a murder conviction hanging over her head, it would have been easy for her to hide away. But instead, Amanda Knox has tried to lead a normal life in the US over the past three-and-a-half years.

She has graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle with a degree in creative writing, penned theater reviews for a weekly paper and become engaged to musician Colin Sutherland.

And now, she has been sensationally cleared, alongside her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, of the murder of her former roommate, Meredith Kercher, who was found dead in Italy seven years ago.

Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas and Mr Sutherland, Knox, 27, broke down in tears as she addressed the press following Italy's Supreme Court's ruling on Friday night.

Free: Amanda Knox (seen addressing the media alongside her fiance, Colin Sutherland, left, on Friday after she was sensationally cleared of murder) has tried to lead a normal life over the past three-and-a-half years

Engaged: She has graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in creative writing and become engaged to Sutherland, a musician. Above, Knox with Sutherland outside her mother's house on Thursday

Placing her hands over her chest, she said: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' The former inmate added that she is 'so grateful to have my life back'.

In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of Kercher, a British student. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively.

However, after they had already served four years in prison, an appeals court in Perugia - where the student was discovered dead - threw out the couple's conviction and declared them innocent.

Knox returned to the US, before another U-turn in the case saw a court in Florence reinstate her original 2009 conviction and increase her sentence to 28-and-a-half years in January 2014.

But on Friday, Italy's highest court overturned that murder conviction with its final ruling in the seven-year-long case, definitively ending the grueling legal battle waged by Knox and her co-defendant. 

Mostly left alone by the media in Seattle since her return from Italy, Knox, who says she will never willingly return to the country, completed her studies at the University of Washington last year.

The former exchange student has also spent time with her family and friends over the past three-and-a-half years - and recently started working as a freelance reporter for the West Seattle Herald. 

The paper's Managing Editor, Ken Robinson, told The Associated Press that Knox has completed pieces on local theater productions for the publication, as well as 'the occasional feature story.'

Relieved: In December 2009, Knox (pictured speaking to the press next to her mother, Edda Mellas, right, on Friday) and Sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of Kercher, a British student

Overjoyed: However, after they had already served four years in prison, an appeals court in Perugia threw out the couple's conviction and declared them innocent. Another court reinstated the convictions in 2014

'She's very good. She's knowledgeable about her subjects she writes well and she gets stuff on deadline,' Robinson said. 'She's a local person. We knew that she was interested in writing.'

Knox's articles have included a review of a production of the David Henry Hwang play 'Chinglish' and a story about a kidney disease survivor to mark National Kidney Month.

She has also written a memoir about her life and her experiences in Italy, which was published in 2013. She was paid a reported $4million for the work.

Knox plans to marry Sutherland, a musician who recently moved to Seattle from New York.
