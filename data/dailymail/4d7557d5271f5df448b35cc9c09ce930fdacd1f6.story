An Adelaide mansion featuring a 2,000-bottle wine room right next to the dining table is set to go under the hammer.

The six bedroom home in Prospect, north of Adelaide's CBD, is expected to sell for more than $1.6 million when it is auctioned off on June 14.

The temperature controlled wine store in the living and dining room is one of the home's standout features and is proving to be a major talking point.

'I had a cellar in my last house, so I saw this type of cellar in Eastern Cellars and I said one day I'll do one of those and I was lucky enough to build one and make it a feature because I love wine,' owner George Panagopoulos told the Advertiser.

'People can't believe it, they love it, and it keeps the wine at the perfect temperature.'

The Dudley Avenue house, owned by Mr Panagopoulos and his wife Alison, features an open plan kitchen, dining and living room that opens to an entertaining area with an outdoor kitchen.

Mr Panagopoulos said the 'resort style' house could easily accommodate more than 120 people for entertaining.

The master suite is located on the ground floor and features a walk-in-robe with a whole bank of shelves dedicated to shoes.

The remaining bedrooms and study are on the second floor.

Mr Panagopoulos said while his family loved the house, they were selling up to find a larger property in the area.
