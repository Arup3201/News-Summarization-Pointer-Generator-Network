A mistake from Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo on his debut allowed Napoli’s Swiss midfielder Blerim Dzemaili to score the only goal in his team’s 1-0 win in Geneva.

The Chile keeper had played well until he fumbled the long shot with 10 minutes left to give Rafa Benitez’s side victory over Luis Enrique’s young team.

Barcelona are still missing all three of their first choice strikers and without Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez they failed to turn some good football into goals and paid the price when Bravo conceded late on.

Horror show: The Chile goalkeeper can only watch the ball drop into the net in Geneva

Take that: Switzerland midfielder Dzemaili couldn't believe his luck after the goal

Disappointing: It has been anything but a perfect start at Barcelona for new boss Luis Enrique

Surrounded: Barcelona playmaker Andres Iniesta looks to escape the attention of Napoli players

In their second pre-season friendly under their new coach Barca lined-up with a strong defence and a first-choice midfield but were missing all three of their star strikers.

Bravo started in goal behind Martin Montoya, Gerard Pique, Marc Bartra and Jordi Alba. And Ivan Rakitic took his place alongside Sergi Busquets and captain Andres Iniesta in midfield. But up front Pedro played alongside 18-year-old Munir El Haddadi and Rafinha Alcantara.

It was Munir who had the best chance of the first half when played in by Rakitic. He drew the advancing Rafael Cabral but the Napoli keeper stuck out a left arm to deflect the youngster’s shot clear.

Munir missed another one on one with Rafael but was at least finding space with some intelligent running as Barca tried to break down Napoli’s well organised defence. 

Making his mark: Ivan Rakitic started for the Catalan giants in Geneva

At the other end Bravo showed good decision-making when he came out to smother the ball at Jose Callejon’s feet and he also tipped away a Marek Hamsik header from a Callejon cross midway through the first half.

Barcelona had enjoyed most of the possession in the first half but were missing the finishing Messi, Suarez and Neymar will bring them. Messi is now back in full training while Neymar is still in the processing of recovering from the cracked vertebrae he suffered at the World Cup. Suarez is due to appeal against his four-month FIFA ban when he appears at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday.

Another former Premier League forward, Michu, came on for Napoli in the second half replacing the Colombian striker Duvan Zapata (who had worn the No 91 shirt in the first half).

Pedro had the first chance of the second half shooting into the side netting from the edge of the area after Kalidou Koulibaly had headed clear.  

Good start: Claudio Bravo made a great save early on to on his first appearance for the club

Strong: Centre back Gerard Pique looked to hold off opposing forward Duvan Zapata

The Spain forward then very nearly finished Barcelona’s best move of the game. A 40-yard cross-field pass from Pique was nudged back to Pedro by Alba but again he shot into the side netting.

Rafinha then shot from distance forcing another save from Rafael but still the breakthrough did not come and on the hour Enrique made six substitutions.

Iniesta, Pedro, Munir, Rakitic, Alba and Pique were replaced by midfielders Sergi Samper and Sergi Roberto; 19-year-old forward Sandro Ramires; Croatia’s youngest ever debutant Alen Halilovic, 18-year-old full-back Grimaldo and 20-year-old Portuguese defender Edgar Le.

Bartra took the armband from Pique but when he was also taken off it changed hands for a third time with Montoya now the oldest outfield Barca player on the pitch aged 23.

In that second raft of changes former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu came on and after Bravo’s mistake and it was left to him to lead the charge for the equaliser but Rafael saved his shot after he cleverly room for himself in the area. Deulofeu then sent over a dangerous cross but Michu cleared as Napoli held on for the win.

Pace: Martin Montoya does well to keep up with Lorenzo Insigne
