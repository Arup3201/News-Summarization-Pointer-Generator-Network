Jose Mourinho, somewhat resolutely, tells those looking his way in the press room  that he cannot let his emotions rule what's best for Chelsea when it comes to Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech.

And that cold approach seems the way to go with the Chelsea manager looking more and more prepared to opt for Courtois in the starting XI against Burnley over the man 10 years his senior.

'The best way for me to work is to think pragmatically,' says Mourinho. That will be the case should Cech, Chelsea's undisputed No 1 for the past decade, be consigned to watch their Premier League season start  from the substitutes bench at Turf Moor.

Cech, winner of three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League with Chelsea, has not faced such a threat in his 10 years at the club.

Courtois, though, is not considered your ordinary goalkeeper. 

The 6ft 6 Belgian - an inch taller than Cech for what it's worth - is regarded as one of the best in the world after helping Atletico Madrid win their first La Liga title for 18 years and, at 22, has plenty left to give.

Being stuck between a rock and a hard place has  never felt so good for Mourinho who, as blunt as ever, insists he can keep hold of his apparent second-choice goalkeeper.

‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club,' he said. 

'We can. We are economically stable. We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. 

'I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers? I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager.'

The trouble is Cech  may feel waiting  to be brought back into the loop at the age of 32 is a battle not worth waging.

As a result, Paris Saint-Germain have been circling Cech and Chelsea goalkeeeping coach Christophe Lollichon in anticipation of him being dropped.

The  Ligue 1 club remain open to a loan as it would see them meet UEFA's strict Financial Fair Play restrictions, although Monaco and Real Madrid are there to create competition.

Mourinho, who ended Courtois's three-year loan spell in La Liga,  told his squad the starting XI during training on Sunday and has certainly taken this - a 'problem every manager in every club would like to have' - in his stride.

Insistent: Jose Mourinho believes he can keep both goalkeepers well satisfied at Stamford Bridge
