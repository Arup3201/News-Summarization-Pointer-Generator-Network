Fed up with the morning commute on the roads of Birmingham, an internet entrepreneur has come up with a novel way of getting to the office.

Mike Bandar has taken advantage of the fact that the city has more canals than Venice and is paddling his way to work.

The 23-year-old takes 40 minutes to cover the two-mile distance through the heart of the city, avoiding the busy traffic and not having to put up with public transport.

Mike Bandar paddles his kayak two-miles to his office in Birmingham every day

He gets some funny looks as he walks through town with his 8ft craft but people are getting used to it now

Each morning, Mr Bandar carries his 8ft kayak through the Jewellery Quarter to the Fazely Canal to work at his dating website.

He said: 'Every morning other people heading off to work have a good laugh at me as I walk down the street with my kayak under my arm.

'But those looks quickly turn to admiration from the walkers and cyclists when they see me kayaking down the canal.

'Walking or cycling the canals simply does not compare to kayaking in terms of how enjoyable an experience it is.

'All day I'm usually on my phone or answering emails, but on the kayak it's total switch-off time. Luckily for me I haven't fallen in yet.'

Mr Bandar explained how he originally came up with the idea to take to the water while on his way to work at Birmingham Science Park.

Mr Bandar says he likes to set himself a different challenge every month and for August he wants to kayak to work

He said that kayaking the route is better than walking or cycling and it gives him time to switch off

'I live by challenging myself to do something new each and every month for 30 days,' said Mr Bandar.

'This ranges from 30 days of mediation, to learning French for this time to eating meat - despite me being a veggie.

'So a month ago I was looking for my 
latest challenge and decided that travelling to work by kayak would be 
the perfect new thing for me to do.'

The Birmingham Canal Navigations network is 100 miles long in total, while Venice has just 26-miles.

However, the number of canals in Birmingham is down from its 18th Century heyday, when 174-miles of canal were in operation during Britain's Industrial Revolution.
