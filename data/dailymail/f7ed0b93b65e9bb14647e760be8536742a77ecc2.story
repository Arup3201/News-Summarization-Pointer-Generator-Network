Click here to see how Scotland manged to find the net for their freak opener and all of the other stats that matter from Ibrox 

Progress doesn’t need to be pretty all the time. Thanks to an untidy own goal Scotland secured vital victory from the first game for two years in which meaningful tournament qualification points were fully expected – and, mercifully, delivered.

Scotland utterly bossed the 110th ranked team in the world and fully merited a more emphatic margin of success from their play that was pleasing on the eye for much of the action.

But a clinical presence deserted the team, particularly Steven Naismith on his return to Ibrox, and Gordon Strachan was grateful for an inside job. The errant leg of Akaki Khubutia proved to be the scrappy lock-breaker on 28 minutes.

So, Scotland did not require a finishing touch from within the improving ranks to keep the momentum of Strachan’s regime moving towards a serious shot at reaching Euro 2016. There has been plenty of praise from racking up a six game unbeaten run, finding a way to win friendlies and vastly superior displays. This was about precious points with the pressure turned on. All three were deservedly earned in a 13th game without defeat for the national team at the home of Rangers.

The cranked up expectations did not persuade Strachan to stand by the man with the greatest experience of big match demands. Darren Fletcher, with only 25 minutes of club football since his substitution in Dortmund, started on the bench as Scott Brown stepped in to skipper the side on his international return from injury.

The Manchester United midfielder could not have complained. This was a typical Duracell day from Brown. He was the driving force, tempo setter and refused to accept the ball dropping into visiting possession, always scrapping successfully to win it back.

That trademark work from Brown was just one aspect of Scotland’s play that ensured Georgia were kept on the back foot virtually from pillar to post. He’s no fan of pernickety UEFA procedure when points are on the line, either, as demonstrated by his brief spat with the fourth official as a jersey change took a split second or two longer than he liked.

Echoes of ‘Broony, Broony’ were only ever heard at Ibrox at the Celtic end. They were all round the stadium here as the seconds – slowly, obviously - ticked down on victory and the second half nerves were wiped away.

Andrew Robertson was also excellent on his return from an enforced absence and preferred to Steven Whittaker on the left.

The scoring hero from Germany, Ikechi Anya, formed a three-pronged support act to Steven Fletcher with Shaun Maloney on the right flank and Naismith in behind.

All the early play was exclusively in the Georgian half and it was the 15th minute before David Marshall’s penalty box even saw the football in a visiting attack. The only imprint on the game made by sole striker Nikoloz Gelashvili was on the thigh of Alan Hutton. Gelashvili, who plays in Albania for Flamurtari, was fortunate not to see yellow for his recklessness.

On the one occasion Grant Hanley lost his bearings with Gelashvili, early in the second half, the striker skied his angled effort. Indeed, Marshall could have prepped for the contest by watching Joe Hart in what amounted for action against San Marino on Thursday night.

After a period of adjustment to the surprise of facing a back four, Scotland started to drag Georgians from their preferred posts midway through the first half. Corners and crosses from both sides gave Giorgi Loria woes and their disorganisation in the face of this onslaught told in the as the patience and probing produced the opening goal just before the half-hour.

Unsurprisingly, it was one of Robertson’s delightful deliveries that created the chaos and Loria could only force the ball out to the feet of Maloney on the edge of the area. The Wigan schemer scored a screamer in a 2-1 win in Macedonia a year ago, but this was a goal he looked reluctant to claim as his third Scotland strike.

That dubious honour landed with luckless Khubutia. Loria found a touch to initially divert Maloney’s drive from goal but he pushed on to Khubutia and the ball dribbled over the line. Maloney reacted as if he’s caught the ghastly bug that now compels players not to celebrate a goal against their former employers. As relief rippled through the Ibrox stands at breaching the defensive blockade, the Tartan Army were more than happy to make up for Maloney’s low key reaction.

With a confidence-boosting lead, Scotland’s play found a flow and Strachan loved what he saw. If only there was a goal at the end of the good work, he could have relaxed just a little. Fletcher’s link play had teed up Anya in Germany and his touch and hold-up class were seen to great effect.

A smart exchange with Maloney smoothed Naismith’s passage through on the keeper but Loria sped out to smother the ball as the Everton attacker took a heavy touch.

It wasn’t the only time that Naismith was unable to bring his scintillating early season form to the table but, as ever, his tireless work rate and determination never gave the Georgian defenders any peace.

Scotland were ferocious in attacking the visitors from all angles before the break but the relentless approach failed to secure a second as a rasping Brown shot was deflected inches wide and Maloney got wayward with two hits from distance.

Temuri Ketsbaia made an interval switch, introducing Tornike Okriashvili on the left in an effort to give Alan Hutton more to think about than his rampaging runs down the flank. However, Hutton robbed the substitute to scamper towards setting up a golden chance for a Scotland second on 62 minutes.

He slipped Naismith in behind the last line and while the movement was ace, the right foot shot made across goal made life too easy for Loria’s considerable frame and the ex-Rangers man was denied once again by the big keeper.

Naismith’s frustrations continued. Anya and Fletcher combined, with the latter’s creative back heel into the path of Naismith setting up another sight of goal. As Loria braced himself for a test, Naismith screwed a low shot well wide. Naismith, with goals against Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, made way for James McArthur with 10 minutes remaining.

Georgia’s second half set-up was built to menace more on the break. Their forays up the park fizzled out. Ibrox did gasp in horror as the ball dropped to Irakli Dzaria 16 yards out on one such counter. The substitute’s low dig was dire, five yards wide.

Scotland wanted a settling second but Morrison was denied by a combination of Solomon Kverkvelia and keeper. And just to increase the nervous tension, the fourth official’s hapless fiddling with the substitute board kept the celebrations on tap as Chris Martin’s late introduction was subject to delay.

The Derby man coaxed a couple of free kicks out of the Dutch referee and held up play long enough for there to be no further dramas. A win essential to establishing a foundation from which to launch a bid to beat off Poland and Republic of Ireland for an automatic qualifying slot is in the books. Now for Warsaw where a repeat of another 1-0 win from only seven months ago will do just fine.
