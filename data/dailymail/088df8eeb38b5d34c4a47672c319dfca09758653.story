In hindsight, we should have seen it coming. Everything was going far too well.

This is a club, in my lifetime and before, that has perennially shot itself in the foot.

Tony Pulis' departure is one that is already leaving us Palace fans wondering 'what if' - and the season hasn't even started yet.

Gone: Tony Pulis has left Crystal Palace on the eve of the new Premier League season

Here we go again: Palace fans are dismayed to see Pullis leave after he ensured their safety last season

Yet, the circumstances, though played out on a bigger stage and with different variables, are not too dissimilar to when Dougie Freedman left for Bolton nearly two years ago

The board then were unwilling to give in to Freedman's demands of a bigger and longer contract as a reward for his success, and off he went to Bolton.

Similarly, Pulis' demands - for the club to spend big on Steven Caulker, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Michu - have not been met and he too is hot-footing out of SE25.

Now, it must be said that an 11th-placed finish in the Premier League should give a manager a far stronger mandate to get what he wants than merely a strong start to the season in the Championship, but the under-lying principles remain the same.

CPFC 2010, the consortium of Palace fans which saved the club from extinction just four years ago, have a clear vision.

To rebuild Palace's infrastructure, which had fallen far behind the requirements of a Championship club, let alone a top flight club, is a vital and ongoing process, and one that must run parallel with, and not be overtaken by, spending on the playing staff.

Managers, by their nature, will often only see the short-term picture - namely, results.

Breaking up is hard to do: Pulis (left) was appointed by Steve Parish (right) but has now left the club

Pulis was achieving an A+ in that regard, but for a club whose top earner was on £10,000-a-week when promoted just 15 months ago, to already be forking out sums of £10million and wages nearing £50,000 would be foolhardy.

Yet that is what Pulis wanted, and you can't blame him. A manager is always going to fight his corner. It just so happened that his unstoppable force met an immovable object in co-chairman Steve Parish.

The fractures in the relationship between the two were there from day one, in fact, they were there before then.

At Pulis' unveiling the pair admitted negotiations to bring him in had been troublesome and lengthy.

Looking back now, it is clear to see why. Pulis was never Parish's sort of manager, an old-school, finger-in-every-pie boss. Equally, Parish was not Pulis' sort of chairman. He wants every decision run by him and the appointment of Iain Moody as sporting director - effectively a middle man between the two - illustrates that.

There were further differences of opinion as the season went on too, but the cracks were papered over.

Target: Michu, who joined Napoli, was one of the players Pulis wanted but was not able to approach

It always felt like a short-term fix when Pulis came in, a manager keen to rebuild his reputation and a club desperate to stay in the top flight meeting for a brief romance, not a long-term marriage. The fundamental differences were always going to come to a head, even if no-one saw it happening this quickly.

In many ways, the board went against their beliefs, their mantra, in hiring Pulis.

As baffling as Parish's stance may seem to some, it makes sense from a business stance - and a business is, effectively, what he is helping run.

Palace were the eighth-best team in the division counting only results from when Pulis took over in November. No key players left in the summer, so why fork out tens of millions when the ambitious manager may well leave at the first sniff of an opportunity higher up the table?

Rome wasn't built in a day, and all that.

Back in the day: Pulis masterminded Palace's remarkable comeback against Liverpool last season

For all his popularity, and Pulis will go into Palace folklore for what he achieved in his nine months in charge, the continued side-lining of academy starlet Jonny Williams and record signing Dwight Gayle, and the reluctance to bring back Wilfried Zaha from his Old Trafford wilderness, did not sit well with many Palace fans.

It seems likely that whoever comes in will be expected to use Williams and Gayle, and perhaps have Zaha to work with too. Whether that trio can make up for the loss of such a talismanic figure in Pulis, only time will tell.

But come what may, life goes on in SE25, as it did when Freedman left and, just, when CPFC 2010 saved the club.

Of course, this an eternally optimistic viewpoint, but that's what Palace fans are, it's in the fabric of the club and what has kept it going through the dark days, and will do when the season kicks off on Saturday at the Emirates and beyond.

In the words of Steven Gerrard: 'we go again.'
