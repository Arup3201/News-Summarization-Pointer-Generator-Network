Chelsea are pressing ahead in negotiations to buy Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid after showing a willingness to match the £21m buy out clause.

The Brazilian left-back was outstanding last season and will join teammates Diego Costa and Tiago at Stamford Bridge next season.

Target: Filipe Luis impressed for Atletico last season and is keen to make the move to Chelsea

Jose Mourinho has already bolstered his squad by buying Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona, and appears keen to pick up stars from Spanish champions Atletico to join him.

Chelsea sold David Luiz to PSG for £50m earlier this summer, so have money to spend.

Target men: Lukaku (left) and Negredo (right) are both candidates to replace Costa at Atletico

Atletico are keen on Romelu Lukaku but have also asked Manchester City about Alvaro Negredo's availability to replace Costa.
