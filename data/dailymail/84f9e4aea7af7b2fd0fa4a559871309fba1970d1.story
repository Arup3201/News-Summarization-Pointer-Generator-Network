More shocking details were revealed by Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell in the continuing here Comes Honey Boo Boo saga.

Cardwell, 20, told E! News that fears her husband Michael could one day get deadly revenge on Mark McDaniel are among the many things involving the molester that continue to haunt her.

'Michael would probably kill him,' if given the chance, said Cardwell of her husband of six months, who she says carries a gun wherever he goes.

Cardwell says McDaniel repeatedly sexually assaulted her in 2002 while her mother--who was dating the now 53-year-old--was working at a McDonough, Georgia McDonald's.

Ironically, that's where Mama June first met up with McDaniel after they met online.

'She found him online, they met at Mcdonald's,' Cardwell told E!.

Cardwell detailed the abuse she suffered, unbeknownst to Mama June, before McDaniel was put away for 10 years following a 2004 aggravated child abuse charge.

'Mama was mainly at work,' Cardwell said. The abuse happened in the car sometimes but mostly at Chickadee's home.

She said some of the abuse even happened in her mother's bed. All the while, Cardwell says McDaniel begged her not to tell anyone--especially the police.

Cardwell has a 2-year-old daughter with Michael, but says sometimes she has to remind herself to be strong in the face of her demons

So she didn't. 'I never wanted to hurt my mother,' she said.

But now that Cardwell has opened up about the abuse she says she suffered, she's the one who continues to be hurt.

Cardwell claimed Monday her mother siphoned off her $30,000 trust fun to buy McDaniel a car.

Chickadee told E! News in a revealing interview that she checked with the bank on a hunch and discovered the money had somehow dwindled to just $17.90.

'I have a feeling mama used that to buy a car and buy him what he wants,' 20-year-old Cardwell said, referring to Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation.  

Cardwell also claimed Monday that the 'united front,' as TMZ calls it, that Mama June and ex Sugar Bear are putting on in the face of claims they could lose custody of star Alana is just that: a front.

'Mama's using sugar bear to cover her ass,' claimed Cardwell.

Meanwhile, Mama June denied claims about the car completely to E! News, saying, 'I never bought him a car.'

With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life.

'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin stated. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' 

However, TMZ reported October 26 that Mama June was spotted at a Georgia car dealer, where she plunked down $25,000 cash to purchase two used Nissan Altimas.

One was for a family member, while the other was delivered to a 'friend' in Decatur--to the very address McDaniel listed on his sex offender registry, TMZ claimed. 

Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago.

She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. 

Living the single life? Cardwell claims her mother's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear was just to keep up appearances

TMZ claimed in late October that Mama June had plunked down $25,000 for two Nissan Altimas (file photo pictured), one for a family member and another for a 'friend.' The site claimed that friend is Mark McDaniel

Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with Alana.

After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons.

Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch.

Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'.

The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell.
