Joseph Minala, the Lazio midfielder who fell under official investigation after it was claimed he was a 42-year-old masquerading as a youth team player, has joined FC Bari on a one-year loan deal.

Minala made the switch to the Serie B side  the day after turning 18, having made his Serie A debut for Lazio last season in a 2-0 home win against Sampdoria.

And Cameroon-born Minala immediately put to bed any questions of his age at his new club.

'They gave me different ages,' he said. 'The truth is that I'm 18 years old. Someone has created this story that I've never touched. I've never been embarrassed by something that has never existed.'

The Italian FA launched an investigation in May after an African football website claimed Minala was pretending to be 17 and had altered his passport to strip 25 years off.

That led to an official investigation which saw him questioned by the league's federal prosecutor, who later confirmed the matter was 'closed' and that there were 'no doubts about his age'.

Minala, after putting pen to paper with Bari on Monday, added on Bari's official website: 'No matter the company or the shirt I'm wearing, my determination and my hunger is the same.

'It is not where I am that makes me change my mind about what I have to give on the field. I always try to have fun doing our best.'

The midfielder hopes to make headlines for the right reasons in Italy's second tier, and added: 'I'm ready for training with my new teammates and the coach to see where there are. The work I have seen of Bari immediately appears to me a solid team and quality.

'A group in which there is a holder or a reserve and you have to fight every day to conquer the place.'
