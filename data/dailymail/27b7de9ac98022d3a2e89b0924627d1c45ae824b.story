Jan Hooks died from cancer which she hoped to beat - and looked 'great' just a week ago, friends have revealed.

The Saturday Night Live veteran, who died aged 57 on Thursday, told neighbors she was battling the disease, but 'took a turn for the worse' in recent days.

And today, her one-time SNL co-star Nora Dunn - who was the other half of the infamous Sweeney Sisters - said: ‘I knew she wasn't well, but we always think things will get better. 

‘It takes a long time, a long history, to know that the best things, the best moments in life, are gone in what seems like a flash.

‘She and I had our best moments together on television’.

Jan is believed to have died at a Manhattan hospital, and paying tribute to the actress, Larry Liberstein, head of her building's co-op board, recalled how he would often see her walking her two German Shepherds, saying : 'She was very bubbly. She had one of those grins that meant you couldn't help bringing a smile to your face. It was an infectious smile.'

Mr Liberstein confirmed that Jan told him she was suffering from cancer, telling MailOnline:  'I last saw her a week ago and she said that she was ill. It didn't seem that dire. She must have taken a turn for the worse. I think she was at a point where she was talking about it.

'She wasn't hopeless. I don't think she expected it to happen this fast.'  

Jan featured on SNL between 1985 and 1991 - at the same time as some of its greatest comedians including Phil Hartman, Chris Farley, Dennis Miller and Mike Myers.

She was famous for playing half of the Sweeney Sisters, a talentless but overly enthusiastic lounge act, and for her impersonations of Sinead O’Connor. She was also the first SNL cast member to play Hillary Clinton.

Paying an emotional tribute to her friend, Nora Dunn wrote on Facebook that Jan overcame her stage fright for each episode of SNL - and then 'carried the show’.

She wrote also revealed that Jan came up with the idea for the Sweeney sisters ‘on the spot’ and just ran with it. 

Speaking to MailOnline today, Nora revealed she was set to embark on a new project with Jan this April, but due to her ill health it never happened. 

Meanwhile, Peter Guttman, an award-winning travel photographer and journalist, one of Jan's neighbours, told MailOnline that she would pepper everyday conversations in the laundry room with jokes and comic asides.

He said: 'I was always impressed that somebody who had got to that level of fame seemed so down to earth.

'The last time I saw her was a couple of months ago and when she asked after my son I remember thinking what a good person she was.

'When I became aware she was my neighbour and I looked at her work I was impressed with the very wide diversity of her stage presence.

'When she died my son called me to ask if I had heard. I was surprised by the amount of interest as it seemed like she'd been forgotten'. 

Jan's former SNL co-star and boyfriend, Kevin Nealon today said that they had had ‘amazing times as friends, then dating and then the incredible rush of being on SNL together’.

He then posted a picture of the couple together, writing: 'My girlfriend in the 80s and my friend forever, Janners. God you were talented. Too soon and too sad.'
