With its rolling hills and stone bridge over a picturesque stream it seems like the perfect reason for a day trip to the Welsh countryside. 

Only visitors taking up the trip to the Brecon Beacons, advertised by Britain's national tourism board, would be disappointed as the image used is actually of the Lake District - more than 200 miles away.

The bungle was discovered on the Visit Britain website where a photograph of Skiddaw from Ashness Bridge in Keswick was used to advertise trips from Cardiff to the Brecon Beacons national park. 

Visit Britain, the national tourism board, has been using a picture of the Lake District - 250 miles away - to promote tours to the Brecon Beacons on a website advert aimed at day trips for American visitors 

It has led to criticism of the large tourism board, responsible for promoting British trips worldwide, for a poor knowledge of geography.  

Anyone taking up the $79 day trip would have found themselves at least a five hour drive away from the actual scene. 

The photograph was used to promote the day trip for visitors from America. The description read: 'Tour stops include: Brecon Beacons National Park - see the stunning lakes, waterfalls and peaks of this world-famous site.'

The National Trust describes Ashness Bridge as 'the most photographed packhorse bridge in the Lake District'.

Greg Stephenson, Cumbria Tourism's PR Manager, said: 'It's flattering that VisitBritain have used Surprise View, Ashness Bridge, to portray the Welsh countryside, after all the Lake District's offering is the best in the world.

The image of Ashness Bridge in Keswick is an iconic and popular image used of the Lake District park  

The actual Brecon Beacons park differs widely from the image used in the Visit Britain ad of Keswick 

'I know historically the two areas were closely tied. Perhaps we should reunite and create a greater Cumbria to assist our friends in London, especially as they don't seem to know their geography.'

Hotelier Jonathan Denby, president of the Lakes Hospitality Association, added: 'This is what happens when you have a Welshman in charge of Cumbria Tourism - congratulations to Ian for getting into the psyche of Welsh tourism.'

A spokesman for VisitBritain described it as a 'glitch' with how photographs had been tagged, which meant it had appeared as a Brecon Beacons image. It has now been replaced, he said.
