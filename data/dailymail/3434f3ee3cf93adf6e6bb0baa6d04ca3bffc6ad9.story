Ed Miliband was tackled by a disgruntled voter yesterday who said people were deserting Labour because of the party’s failure to offer an EU referendum.

In a rare non-stage-managed encounter with a member of the public, the Labour leader was told by an aircraft factory worker that voters wanted to have a say on whether Britain should continue its membership of the EU.

In the awkward encounter, Peter Baldwin, an electrician at BAE Systems in Lancashire, told Mr Miliband: ‘This morning we sat in the brew room over there, your workers, and they are all leaning now towards Ukip.

‘The question on everyone’s mind is the referendum. I know what you are going to say but the working-class man in here wants to have a say. We have too many people here, that is why we have all got these people out of work.’

The Labour leader said that if he won office, he would make jobless EU migrants wait two years before claiming benefits and stop firms undercutting the minimum wage, before shaking Mr Baldwin’s hand and saying ‘very nice to meet you’. 

Mr Baldwin later told the BBC that he was referring to a chat between ‘20-odd working-class blokes’. He said: ‘Basically they are just not happy with Labour at the moment. The big thing with the working-class man is immigration and Europe.’

Mr Miliband was on a visit to the BAE site in Samlesbury and given a tour of its workshops, where the F35 Lightning II and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft are built.

His encounter with Mr Baldwin came as one of Labour’s biggest donors warned that failing to offer the public an in-out referendum could lose the party the election. John Mills, who has given £1.65 million to Labour, said Mr Miliband’s refusal to let the public have a say would ‘certainly’ cost the party votes in key seats.

The multi-millionaire owner of retail business JML Ltd told a conference of Eurosceptics in London: ‘I have heard rumours that there is a majority in the Shadow Cabinet who are in favour of having a referendum. I’m sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose Labour votes in what is going to be a very tight election.’

John Mills, who has handed £1.65 million to Ed Miliband's party, has warned Labour could lose the election over Europe

Labour could lose the election by refusing to offer the public a referendum on the European Union, according to one of the party's biggest donors.

John Mills, who has handed £1.65 million to Ed Miliband's party, said the Labour leader's refusal to let the public have a say would 'certainly' cost them votes in key seats.

A multi-millionaire through his retail business JML Ltd, Mr Mills who is a longstanding Eurosceptic, said he had heard reports that a majority of Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet back an in-out poll.

He also cautioned the party that refusing to dangle the threat of leaving the EU would grievously damage their chances of securing any reform to the way the 28-member union works.

'I have heard rumours that there is a majority of people in the shadow cabinet who are in favour of having a referendum', Mr Mills told a conference of Eurosceptics in central London.

'I'm sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose Labour votes in what is going to be a very tight election.

'I think it certainly will and this is one of the major reasons why, from a tactical and strategic point of view, it is in the Labour party's interests to have a referendum sometime between 2015 and 2020.'

The businessman was involved in the campaign against Britain's membership of the European Economic Community in 1975, when the Conservatives wanted to stay in and the Labour party was split.

He said if there was another referendum, senior people in the Labour party should be allowed to campaign either way. 'What was agreed then [in 1975] was that each side of the Labour party could make speeches and campaign for what they thought was right. My guess is that something like that will happen again', he said. 'I think the unions will probably be split as well.'

If Labour do win office, he said he did not rule out the party having a change of heart about holding a vote, saying: 'I don't think it's impossible….a referendum at some time in the next Parliament'.

But he warned that party that failing to do so would backfire. Mr Miliband has effectively ruled out a referendum before 2020 saying it would only be trigged by a major transfer of new powers to the EU.

His pro-European foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander has said EU membership 'remains central to our prosperity and security' and that Labour would 'set itself the task of reviewing, repairing, and resetting our country's approach to Europe.'

Mr Mills said this approach, if Mr Miliband wins, would 'inevitably weaken the UK's bargaining position'. He said: 'Minds in Brussels are much more likely to take renegotiation seriously if they know that there is a substantial risk that the UK will leave the EU if there is not a satisfactory deal on the table to persuade the UK to stay in.

'Whether they want to remain in the EU or they want to leave, there are many in the Labour Party who are united in their belief that the British people must be given an EU referendum to put this issue to bed once and for all.'
