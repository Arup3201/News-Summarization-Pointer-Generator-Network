Dead: Julia Niswender, pictured, was found dead in her bedroom on Tuesday night

A 23-year-old Eastern Michigan University student has been found murdered in her off-campus apartment after she failed to show up to a Christmas party.

Police launched a homicide investigation after they discovered Julia Niswender's lifeless body in her bedroom on Tuesday night along with evidence they dubbed 'suspicious.'

Niswender's roommate called police at around 9.30pm and asked them to check on the young woman after she hadn't been seen for a number of days.

The pretty communications major worked at Walmart part time and had also failed to show up at the supermarket's staff Christmas celebrations that night, concerning colleagues.

Officers arrived and called paramedics but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ypsilanti police Detective Sgt. Thomas Eberts said police were treating Niswender's death as suspicious, adding that the evidence found in her apartment led to 'unanswered questions.'

According to Annarbor.com, he wouldn't elaborate on what evidence was uncovered and how she is believed to have been killed.

An autopsy was performed on Wednesday but EMU police chief Robert Heighes said it could be days before the cause of death is known.

Police haven't released any information about a possible murder suspect.

The university sent out an alert to warn students of an incident near campus as soon as police discovered the woman's body, Fox News reported.

While she didn't live at the university, she shared a flat at the Peninsular Place Apartments, which are very near to the EMU campus.

EMU police held a campus safety meeting on Wednesday night, taking questions from distraught students and offering safety tips to around 200 members of the community who showed up.

However, Heighes was unable to shed 
light on whether the person who is believed to have killed Niswender was
armed and dangerous.

He did, though, ask students to take extra safety precautions, suggesting they avoid wearing
headphones while walking on campus, walk with a partner, call police
if they see something suspicious and to call authorities if they get 
any unsolicited visitors.

EMU officials also said they're adding extra police patrols.

Niswender was described as a loving, outgoing and kind friend. She was a budding broadcaster who recently toured the NBC studios in New York City, where she met Anderson Cooper.

Next to the picture she got with him, she wrote: 'Yup got a pic with Anderson Cooper :) gotta love NYC and yes i have a cheesy smile lo. (sic)'

The young woman's twin sister, Jennifer, wrote a heartbreaking tribute to Julia on her Facebook page, as condolences from friends and family members flooded her wall.

'No
one will ever understand what I am going through right now, but I just 
want to say thank you to everyone who has been calling, texting, 
emailing and posting and for all your support during this horrible 
time,' she wrote.

'Also, 
thank you to everyone who stopped by to visit with my family and I. I 
wish i could respond to each and everyone of you but words can't 
describe how I feel. Julia was my twin, other half, and best friend.

'No
one will ever understand the bond we shared. I love her so much and 
just don't know how I can go on. My beautiful sister didn't deserve 
this. Justice will be served even if it is the last thing I do! The rest
of my life I will be living for her.'

Speaking at Wednesday's meeting, 
University President Susan Martin choked up as she extended her 
sympathies to Niswender's friends and family.

'Our job is to communicate directly 
to you what we know and what we don't know,' she told students, many of 
whom were in tears in the auditorium.

One of Niswender's Walmart colleagues told Fox News the young woman was 'always smiling.'

'Best personality, loudest laugh, just wouldn't hurt anybody, always smiling,' Keith Logue said.
