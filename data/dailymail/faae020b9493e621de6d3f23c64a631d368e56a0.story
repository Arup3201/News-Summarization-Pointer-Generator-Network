Olivia was diagnosed with cancer two 
years ago after suffering a seizure on vacation. Her condition had been 
deteriorating in recent months.

The teen loved to sing, so her cousin
 Jeff Kassel arranged for her to record in a studio with a music 
producer friend of his, a long-time dream of hers.

'It was really just for an experience for her to have, and her family,' he said.

The video was watched on YouTube more
 than a million times and even caught the attention of Katy Perry 
herself who sent Olivia a touching video message to tell her to 'keep 
roaring'.

'I just wanted to reach back out to you and tell you that I saw your video and I was very moved, and you sounded great for being in the studio and making it your wish to record that song, I thought that was really cool,' Katy said of the video, which has already received more than 156,000 views.

'I love you and a lot of people love you, and that's why your video got to me and moved everybody that saw it,' she said.

'So I just wanted to send you some love and some light and tell you that I'm thinking about you. Thank you so much. Keep roaring.' 

Touched: 'I just wanted to reach back out to you and tell you that I saw your video and I was very moved,' said Katy in the video

She still did it: Olivia couldn't walk and had difficulty breathing, and was 'managing a lot of pain,' but she was still able to sing

Though Olivia's condition had deteriorated 'rapidly' in the past few weeks, said Jeff, she watched Katy's message and was 'getting a huge kick out of it'.

'The excitement that it’s been, the positivity... has been such an important boost, I’d say, during these really tough times. It means the world,' he said.

'It’s such an incredible thing and it really adds to Olivia’s legacy that she’s been able to inspire other people.'

Kassel also thanked the media for 'helping to generate so many positive comments and well-wishers' and raising awareness of Wise’s charitable work at the Liv Wise Fund.

Proceeds from the song - available on iTunes - will go towards brain tumor research through the Liv Wise Fund, the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, and the Palliative Advanced Care Team at Sick Kids Hospital in Canada.

As of Monday, the fund had reached just over $78,000 of the $150,000 fundraising goal, according to the Toronto Star.
