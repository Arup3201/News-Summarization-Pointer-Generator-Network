A former Army Colonel has been charged with murdering his wife of more than 40 years in a brutal stabbing at their rural home.

Leonard Webb, 68, who was a member of the Royal Artillery, is believed to have stabbed 64-year-old Doreen Webb to death in Durrington, Wiltshire, on Friday afternoon.

Neighbours described how they saw Webb being led away by police from the family home in handcuffs.

Just minutes earlier, paramedics had sped to the house just two miles from Stonehenge where they found the alleged victim with a fatal knife wound to her chest.

Scene: Officers taped off the detached, suburban home where forensic police experts in white suits were combing for vital evidence

Neighbours said they could not believe what happened, with the pair described as 'a happy couple.'

More than a dozen floral tributes were left outside the semi-detached property, which remained cordoned off by police who stood guard at the house.

One elderly neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mr and Mrs Webb had lived in the quiet residential street for at least 30 years.

'Everybody here is amazed because they were such a good couple,' said the woman. 'You couldn't have wished for a happier couple.'

'None of us can believe what has happened. He was an officer in the Army. I think he was a Colonel before he retired.'

Police, who described the death as a 'domestic incident,' remained at the scene in Durrington

The couple are believed to have married in August 1969 and have six grandchildren.

emergency crews had raced to the scene.

The scene remained under police guard last night and the village was left in a state of shock after the death.

Stunned near neighbour Fred Martin - who served with Webb in the army - said: 'Len was a commissioned officer - I know him very very well. He was a major in the Royal Artillery before he retired.'

South West Ambulance Service said it was called by the police. 'A female had suffered a chest injury and the police were unsure whether she was conscious or breathing.

'We confirmed she was dead at the scene and left.'
