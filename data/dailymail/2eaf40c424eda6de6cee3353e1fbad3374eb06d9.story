Two brothers have taken the concept of Throwback Thursday to a whole new level.

Matt and Evan Breslow decided to reenact six of their favorite childhood photos some 30 years on.

The duo spent around $300 scouring the internet for adult-sized replicas of their tiny outfits before meeting at a Target portrait studio in Monmouth County, New Jersey, to pull off the  photo shoot.

In one shot Matt, 35, appears in a white T-shirt with a blue cardigan pulled over, while his 37-year-old sibling stands behind wearing a smart tie and jacket.

The poses and ensembles match exactly with the brother's childhood shot. The mottled studio background also remains unchanged.

However, stark differences include Matt's bearded face and Evan's balding head.

In another frame they slip into matching sports kit with cheeky grins spread across their faces.

The brothers decided to replicate the old family snaps to surprise their mother.

Sweet idea: The brothers decided to replicate the old family snaps to surprise their mother

Matt traveled from his home in Portland, Oregon, back to the east coast for the occasion.

Recalling the chain of events, he told Yahoo News: 'We didn't surprise [mom] with the pictures, we surprised her with a suitcase full of clothes and took her to Target and told her we were going to take some photos.'

Matt, who runs a grilled cheese food business, said he loved replicating the good old days.

The updated photos are now on display at his parents' home alongside the originals.

Friends and family have applauded the brothers for their novel idea.

One fan wrote: 'So cute. Loved those days . . . where have they gone? From two adorable little boys, to two fabulous handsome young men!'
