The majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal, including captain Paul Gallen, have elected to accept a deal that will see them miss just three matches.

It has been reported the bulk of the 17 players and ASADA have agreed to back-dated 12-month suspensions on Friday morning.

The Sharks players had been given until 9.30am on Friday to accept the deal.

Cronulla Sharks player Wade Graham left his lawyer's office on Wednesday after reportedly being issued with a show-cause notice from the anti-doping authority

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia.

The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signaled the authority's intent to charge players.

Due to the suspensions being back-dated as far back as November 2013, News Corp Australia reported that players would only miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year’s training before the 2015 season begins.

The Sharks skipper, Paul Gallen, was one of 17 players involved in the club's 2011 supplements program to be reportedly offered the suspensions.

Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program

On Wednesday, Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accepted the reduced bans deal offered by ASADA, they would automatically be labelled drug cheats and be admitting to have taken  banned peptides.

The admission could see notices also issued to the Shark's coaching staff for including the peptides in the team's supplement regime

'Obviously there are a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it,' Gallen told Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast.

'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) "thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life".

The notices handed out to players, including Wade Graham (pictured), will only see players miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year's training before the 2015 season begins

'Because closure on this thing would just be unbelievable (after) what we've gone through the past two seasons.

'But then you say "let's stuff this, we've done nothing wrong". It's a real hard situation to be in.'

Gallen was adamant he hadn't taken any banned substance.

'I'm 100 per cent positive I've never taken anything that's been on any banned list,' he said.

Despite only missing a small section of each season, Gallen expressed concern over having to miss out on representing Australia in the Four Nations series later this year and potential lucrative off-season boxing bouts he hoped to have.

'That's huge - you can't get those games for Australia back,' he said.

'But it's your reputation; it's what I've built over the last 15-plus years in training fulltime and getting to where I've got to in the game.

Players, including Nathan Gardner (pictured) were given 10 days to respond and could ahve chosen to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court

Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players, including Albert Kelly, have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority

'It's tarnished now already, but no matter what, if we do this we're going to be labelled a drug cheat.'

Among some of the other players offered suspensions are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas, Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner.
