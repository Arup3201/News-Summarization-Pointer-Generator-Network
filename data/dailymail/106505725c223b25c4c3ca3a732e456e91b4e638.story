Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour beamed with pride yesterday as he watched his son Charlie graduate from Cambridge University.

The controversial student was awarded his degree in history a year late, after being jailed for a rampage at a violent protest over tuition fees in London.

His rock star father was joined by his wife Polly Samson for the graduation ceremony at the historic Senate House.

Graduating: Charlie Gilmour has received a Cambridge degree after being released from prison

22-year-old Charlie returned to Cambridge for his final year last autumn after spending four months in prison, and managed to achieve 2:1.

He caused national outrage when he was pictured swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph, and was also accused of throwing a bin at a convoy of cars containing Prince Charles.

In July 2011, he was sentenced to 16 months in jail after pleading guilty to violent disorder.

But he fitted in with the other respectable Cambridge students dressed in a traditional gown with a black graduation hood.

Event: Ms Samson tweeted about her excitement over seeing her son graduate a year late

Charlie was adopted by the Pink Floyd star after Ms Samson separated from his biological father, the poet Heathcote Williams.

His mother, who was today wearing a blue dress and jacket, married Mr Gilmour in 1994 and they have homes in London and Hove in Sussex.

She tweeted yesterday: 'In Cambridge for son’s graduation. I’ve dressed as Mrs Robinson for the occasion.

Notorious: The student was pictured swinging off the Cenotaph using a Union Flag during tuition fee protests

'Son gets to wear wing-tipped collar, fur-edged hood, white bow-tie, gown. This is best fancy dress party ever.'

She later posted an Instagram photo of her with her husband and son and added: 'Bursting with pride and joy.'

Before getting a place at Cambridge, Charlie attended Lancing College in West Sussex, which costs £9,000 a term.
