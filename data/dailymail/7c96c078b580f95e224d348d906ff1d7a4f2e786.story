An eleventh woman has accused San Diego mayor Bob Filner of sexually harassing her - claiming he said he would help an Iraq-wounded Marine, in exchange for her having a sexual relationship with him.

Nurse Michelle Tyler claims that Filner asked her for a personal relationship - including dinner dates - in exchange for helping wounded U.S. Marine Katherine Ragazzino.

The alleged victim told a news conference that Filner - who has been accused by ten other women of harassing them - told her his help depended on her being seen in public with him.

She said: 'He made it very clear that 
his expectation was that his help for Katherine depended on my 
willingness to go to dinner with him, spend personal time with him and 
be seen in public with him.'

Ms
Tyler cares for Ms Ragazzino, who experienced a traumatic brain injury 
and post-traumatic stress disorder while serving and has since struggled
to resolve a problem with Veterans Affairs, Politico reported.

The
incident allegedly took place on June 11 in the mayor’s office, two 
years after Tyler first discussed Ragazzino's care with Filner.

After allegedly asking others to leave
the room  asked to spend time with Tyler, the former 10-term 
congressman made it clear he wanted to kiss her, and asked whether she 
was married and if he could call her.

Ms Ragazzino said 'I do not appreciate being used as a bargaining chip to fulfill his sexual desires.'

Ms Tyler will not be filing a lawsuit against Filner at this time, but her attorney, Gloria Allred has sent a letter to San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith to demand an investigation into the incident.

The former congressman is less than eight months into his first four-year term as mayor.

Bob Filner is attending therapy following the host of allegations

Eleven women, including a university dean and a retired Navy rear admiral, have gone public with accusations that Filner made unwanted passes.

Some contend that he cornered them and made sexual advances that included groping and slobbering kisses.

He has begun two weeks of intensive therapy this week while facing a sexual harassment lawsuit and calls for his resignation amid a flurry of allegations that he groped women for years.

One accuser, former Filner communications director Irene McCormack Jackson, has filed a harassment lawsuit against him.

Even as he undergoes treatment, Filner is set to be grilled by lawyers under oath this week in a lawsuit brought by Ms McCormack Johnson over claims he asked her to work without panties, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her around in a headlock while whispering in her ear.

Last week the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit.

In a bizarre twist, lawyers representing Filner have claimed that if San Diego had provided mandatory sexual harassment training, then Jackson may never have filed the case.

The claims suggest that if Filner is found liable in the claim, he could blame his own city council.

As reported by NBC 7, in a letter, Filner’s lawyer Harvey Berger, said: 'The City has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees. '

The City failed to provide such training to Mayor Filner.

'This is not an excuse for any inappropriate behavior which may have occurred, but I have learned that many – if not most – people do not know what is and what is not illegal sexual harassment under California law.'
