At last evening’s ceremony Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dedicated their CFDA win for Accessory Designer of the Year to their former employee and deceased fashion designer Jay Ott.

During the twins’ acceptance speech Ashley addressed the audience, which included Anna Wintour and Rihanna saying: 'We would like to dedicate this award to a dear friend of ours and a great fashion designer that we lost this year. His name was James Ott and he was a dear friend of ours and a very big fan of all of you.’

Following a six-week search, Ott’s body was found on May 9 in the East River, close to Pier 4 in Bushwick, Brooklyn – the neighborhood in which he had resided. He was 31 years old.

Today, following the Olsens’ CFDA speech, several of Ott’s former co-workers and friends posted a YouTube video of the address to Facebook, calling it ‘beautiful.’

The designer’s initial autopsy report released by the New York City Medical Examiner on May 11 was deemed ‘inconclusive.’ Further investigations into the cause of his death are currently underway.

Ott had originally been reported as missing on March 24. Soonafter, friends and family banded together to plaster missing person fliers across the city on streetlamp poles and in subway stations.

Less than a week after his disappearance, the NYPD uncovered surveillance footage that showed the designer leaving his apartment in Bushwick’s McKibbin Lofts for the last time on March 23 at 4.35am.

A few hours later, at 5.02am, another video feed shows him about to walk over the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan. They are the last known images of the designer.

At the time of his disappearance, Ott was a design director for holding company The Dock Group, where he was helping conceive Rosetta Getty’s debut fashion collection, slated to launch this fall.

He had worked for The Row in designer and senior designer capacities from 2008 through 2012. In 2013 he held a brief stint as a senior designer for J.Mendel.

A native of Toledo, Ohio, Ott was a graduate of the University of Cincinatti’s College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning.
