The grandmother of a five-year-old girl who was allegedly thrown to her death from a 60ft bridge by her father has said he should have killed himself instead.

John Jonchuck Jr, 25, was arrested half an hour after a man was seen speeding towards a bridge and throwing a child 60ft into the water on Wednesday night.

Rescuers found Phoebe Jonchuk 40 minutes later but she could not be resuscitated.

Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother, Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, 51, told My Fox Tampa she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge.

Angelic: Tributes have been paid to Phoebe and a memorial set up for her near the bridge where she fell

Speaking to Click Orlando, she also paid tribute to the youngster, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face, she loved to dance and she sung.

'I don't forgive him. There is no sense in this. He didn't have to do this to her. I just wish there was one thing God could do was to bring her back.'

She added that she was supposed to pick Phoebe up from school on Thursday. The last time she saw her son and daughter together, she said everything was normal.  

Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, told the station that Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. 

'She was my angel, I always called her my angel baby. She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated,' she said.  

First hearing: Jonchuk said he wanted to leave himself 'in the hands of God' when asked about representation

Troubled relationship: Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, said Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. She added that he had been diagnosed with bipolar

'My angel': Paying tribute to Phoebe, Miss Kerr said: 'She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated.'

'He would only let me talk to her on the phone. He wouldn't disclose his location, so I didn't know where to go.'

'He was very, very bipolar,' she told Tampa Bay News. 'He was Jekyll and Hyde all the way.'

Among other medication, Miss Kerr says Mr Jonchuk took regular doses of bipolar pills Seroquel and anti-depressives Zoloft.

When they met, she added, Mr Jonchuk was her 'gay friend', until he told her he 'liked women too'. Soon after, Phoebe was born.  

Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records.

On the last night she saw Phoebe, Miss Kerr said she and Jonchuck had a nice evening together, but later on he called child protective services and made a false abuse allegations. 

She added that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and had been admitted to a mental hospital on several occasions. 

'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right.

'He's not mentally stable, but he was mentally stable enough to take care of a child for five years, so he knew what he did. He cried, the detective said.'

It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish.   

With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months.

But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report.

The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway.

The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay.

The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell.

Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later.

He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder.

Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police.

The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed.

At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney.

'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said.

Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him

Behavior: Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish

Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child

The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.'

Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police.

Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe.

After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police.

Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said.

'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents.

A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.
