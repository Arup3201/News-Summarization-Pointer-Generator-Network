A 90-year-old man who fought and survived in the grueling Pacific Theater during World War II was shocked when he learned that, according to an records mix-up, he was listed as having gone AWOL by the U.S. Military during that same time period.

Dr. Thomas J. Smith Jr., 90, of Albany, New York, discovered in 2006 while obtaining records for a memoir he was writing that the military had mixed him up with another Thomas J. Smith Jr. According to Smith, the source of the confusion was with the middle names of the two men.

'The bottom of the letter is stamped Thomas Jefferson Smith Jr. I’m 
Joseph,' Smith told WTEN.

According to Smith, the man he was mixed up with went AWOL  while Smith was recovering from a gunshot wound to his back on the Marshall Islands, as part of the island-hopping his unit did.

As a Marine, Smith fought in the historic and bloody battle in Iwo Jima, in which nearly 7,000 American soldiers perished.

'It was either killed or be killed,' Smith recalled. Of the 229 men who were part of his unit, only 29 survived.

When he first discovered the error in the records, Smith was unable to take the time to have them corrected, due to caring for his late wife. He also believed that fixing them would be a simple fix.

However, Smith has been unable to make any headway himself in fixing the mistake, trying for two years to have someone respond and rectify the problem.

Smith first sent a letter to the National Personnel Records Center in 
St. Louis, Mo., in 2012, the office that had initially sent him his 
military records. He was referred to the Board for Correction of Naval 
Records, who then referred him to the Marine Corps.

According to Smith, the Marine 
Corps asked him to contact the National Archive. He was last sent to the
 National Personnel Records Center, the office where his original letter
 was sent.

Frustrated, Smith began sending letters to others, such as New York Senator Chuck Schumer. In a final act of desperation, Smith sent a letter to President Obama, hoping that his attention could fix the situation.

'I didn't want it to be a joke, but I did it for self-satisfaction because this is the highest I could go,' said Smith.

According to WTEN, who contacted various agencies on Smith's behalf, the office of Senator Schumer promised to have the error fixed within 8-10 months.
