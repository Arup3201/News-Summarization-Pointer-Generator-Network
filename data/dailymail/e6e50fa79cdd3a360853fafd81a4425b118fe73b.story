Until now, researchers blamed the collapse of the Bronze Age on widespread changes in global temperatures.

But now experts believe the huge population collapse, that took place in around 800BC, actually occurred two generations before this weather shift. 

Records show that colder and wetter weather conditions weren't recorded until after the collapse - and social and economic pressures were more likely to blame. 

Historians will have to find alternative explanations for the huge population collapse in around 800BC, because climate records show that colder and wetter weather conditions didn’t occur until two generations afterward. A stock image of snow covered Wicklow mountains near Dublin is shown

Archaeologists and environmental scientists from the University of Bradford, University of Leeds, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast have shown that the changes in climate that scientists believed to coincide with the population fall, in fact occurred at least two generations later.

Their results, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show that human activity started to decline after 900BC, and fell rapidly after 800BC, indicating a population collapse.

However, climate records reveal that icy conditions didn’t occur until around 750BC. 

Fluctuations in levels of human activity at a given time are reflected by the numbers of radiocarbon dates for a certain period.

The team used statistical techniques to analyse more than 2,000 radiocarbon dates, which they took from hundreds of archaeological sites in Ireland. 

From this, they were able to pinpoint the precise dates Europe’s Bronze Age population collapsed.

Experts from Universities in Britain and Ireland think social and economic pressures were primarily to blame for the population collapse, because when iron production took over, bronze trading networks failed. This caused widespread conflict and social collapse. A Bronze Age spear head is pictured

It has long been thought that climate change led to a dramatic decline in Bronze Age populations in 800BC.

But records show that colder and wetter weather conditions didn’t occur until two generations afterwards.

Experts believe that social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers.

Communities producing bronze needed to trade over very large distances to obtain copper and tin and control of these networks enabled the growth of complex societies dominated by a warrior elite.

As iron production took over, these networks collapsed, leading to widespread conflict and social collapse.

The researchers then analysed climate records from peat bogs in Ireland, and compared the archaeological data to these records to see if the dates tallied.

This information was compared with evidence of climate change across Europe between 1,200BC and 500BC.

Lead author Ian Armit, Professor of Archaeology at Bradford University, said: ‘Our evidence shows definitively that the population decline in this period cannot have been caused by climate change.’

Dr Graeme Swindles, Associate Professor of Earth System Dynamics at Leeds University, added: ‘We found clear evidence for a rapid change in climate to much wetter conditions, which we were able to precisely pinpoint to 750BC using statistical methods.’

Professor Armit said social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers.

Katharina Becker, Lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at University College Cork, explained that the Late Bronze Age is usually seen as a time of plenty, in contrast to an impoverished Early Iron Age.

‘Our results show that the rich Bronze Age artefact record does not provide the full picture and that crisis began earlier than previously thought.’

Professor Armit conceded: ‘Although climate change was not directly responsible for the collapse it is likely that the poor climatic conditions would have affected farming.

‘This would have been particularly difficult for vulnerable communities, preventing population recovery for several centuries.’

He said that in examining the past, humans are inclined to link evidence of climate change with evidence of population change.

‘Actually, if you have high quality data and apply modern analytical techniques, you get a much clearer picture and start to see the real complexity of human/environment relationships in the past.’
