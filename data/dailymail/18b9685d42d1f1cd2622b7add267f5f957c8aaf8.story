A porn website has analyzed their U.S. traffic across 2012 and today revealed the busiest days for some X-rated viewing.

While Americans are least likely to watch pornography on occasions like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter Sunday - it was the days following major celebrations that saw a spike in those logging on.

Website Pornhub - which allows free access to millions of X-rated videos - determined the highest traffic days of 2012 by analyzing the total visitors that visited each day using specialized analytics software.

One to watch: Website Pornhub.com revealed that its highest days of U.S. traffic in 2012 mostly followed public holidays (posed by model)

A research team then compiled numerical data
for the entire year and classified it into several categories including days most trafficked, days least trafficked and most popular 
search terms/categories.

Americans are most likely to watch porn on December 27 - once the stresses and strains of the holiday season have started to wane.

Similarly the Monday after Thanksgiving - also referred to as Cyber Monday by online bargain hunters - was the second busiest porn day of 2012. In third place was May 29 - the Tuesday after Memorial Day weekend.

However several days of celebration made the list for busiest traffic including Veteran's Day (November 12), President's Day (February 20), Columbus Day (October 8), July 5 (after Independence Day), Rosh Hashanah (September 17) and Chinese New Year (January 23).

Feast your eyes: The Monday after Thanksgiving is the second busiest day of the year for one porn site - beaten only by December 27

3. May 29 (Tuesday after Memorial weekend)

4. November 12 (Veteran's Day)

5. FebruaryÂ  20 (President's Day)

6. October 8 (Columbus Day)

7. July 5 (day after Independence Day)

8. September 17 (Rosh Hashanah)

9. January 23 (Chinese New Year)

10. September 4 (Tuesday after Labor Day)

Other big days in the 2012 porn calendar include November 4 when daylight saving provides an extra hour for enthusiasts to log on.

February 6, the Monday after the Superbowl, was also a cause for celebration for some fans as it made the list as the 12th busiest time.

Corey Price, vice-president of 
Pornhub.com told MailOnline: 'The data reveals that people have a 
tendency to log on and enjoy the site on days after certain holidays 
that require them to be with family or friends for extended periods of 
time.

'It shows that people
are making the most of getting back their alone time by spending it at 
our site tending to personal business they might have missed out on.'

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the days when porn was least watched are the major holidays - with the top three being Christmas Day, Thanksgiving and Easter Sunday.

Celebration: The Monday after the Superbowl was one of the busiest days of the year for porn traffic, coming in 12th place on the list
