A spectacular meteor shower lit up the skies last night with 100 shooting stars an hour as the celestial firework display reached its fiery peak.

Sky-watchers across the world braved freezing temperatures to enjoy the Geminid meteor shower after astronomers said the weather conditions were close to perfect for the annual spectacle.

Shooting stars were seen streaking across the night sky just after midnight in London and past the Dover Patrol Memorial in St Margarets Bay, Kent.

The meteor shower was  visible in both hemispheres and was spotted from Skopje in Macedonia to Washington in the US because of the clear skies. 

At their height, the Geminids produce between 50 and 100 shooting stars every hour and they can be seen glowing in multiple colours with occasional rapid bursts of two or three.

Geminid meteors can shine in different colours and may appear red, blue, green, or yellow, as seen last night in Buckinghamshire

Photographer John Baker captured the heavenly display over the wilderness in Dartmoor, Devon, and said it was 'mesmerising'

The best time to see the meteors was around 2am, when the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate - was almost overhead, next to the constellation Gemini. 

But meteors, which travel at more than 22 miles per second, should have been visible throughout the night from around 10pm as they burned up about 24 miles above the Earth.

Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'It should be a good display, weather permitting - we might not be far off perfect conditions in the UK.

'The constellation is very high in the sky and most of the Moon will have gone away. An average of one comet a minute would be a good rate, and that's possible. You might also get little bursts of activity with two or three together.'

Meteor showers occur when the Earth ploughs through clouds of cometary dust. The tiny particles, some no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up brightly as they enter the atmosphere.

Geminids are debris from an extinct three-mile-wide comet called 3200 Phaethon, which was previously believed to be an asteroid, according to NASA.

'Basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun,' NASA said on its website.

But it has an eccentric orbit that looks more like that of a comet than an asteroid and brings it well inside the orbit of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, every 1.4 years.

Traditionally asteroids are made of rock and comets mostly of ice, but NASA describes Geminids as a type of 'rock comet'.

'It's not as clear-cut as it used to be,' said Mr Scagell. 'A lot of asteroids are quite icy. There are asteroids that look a bit like comets and comets that look a bit like asteroids.'

The Geminid meteor shower was first noted in the 1860s, but over time it has become more intense.

There were 20 comets per hour reported in the 1920s, rising to 50 in the 1930s, 60 in the 1940s and 80 in the 1970s. 

Another unusual feature of the Geminids is that they can shine in different colours. Mostly glowing white, they may also appear yellow, blue, green or red.

Regardless of whether 3200 Phaethon is an asteroid or comet, it is classified as a 'potentially hazardous' near-Earth object (NEO).

To be classified as potentially hazardous, an NEO must pass within 4.6 million miles of the Earth. Each year in December, the Earth is less than two million miles from Phaethon's orbit.

At its closest upcoming approach on December 14 2093, the object will be 1,812,640 miles away - quite far enough to be safe.  

Photographer John Baker captured the heavenly display over the spectacular wilderness in Dartmoor, Devon. 

'It was absolutely magnificent. The smaller meteors can be fairly common but the bigger ones are rarer and some of the bigger ones were just stunning.

'The viewing conditions on Dartmoor were almost perfect - among the best I've ever seen.

'The combination of the iconic landscape and the spectacular display was just mesmerising.'
