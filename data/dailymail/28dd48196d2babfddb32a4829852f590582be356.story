But Ibrahimovic salvaged a point with a lob from a tight angle in the 63rd minute.

PSG missed Ezequiel Lavezzi, David Luiz, Maxwell, Blaise Matuidi and Yohan Cabaye, who are building up fitness after playing at the World Cup.

Brazilian defender Luiz was purchased by the French giants in a record £50million move from Chelsea in June.
