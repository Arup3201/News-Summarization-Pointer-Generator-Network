A Florida congressman got into a heated argument with a colleague during a House of Rules Committee hearing after claiming that Texas was 'a crazy state' and refusing to apologize. 

During the Monday meeting on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee L. Hastings got into a dispute with Texas Republican Rep. Michael C. Burgess. 

In the midst of the discussion, Hastings said to Burgess: 'Had governors worked with the administration, we might not be in this position. I don't know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with - and I mean that just as I said it.'

Burgess reads before a House Rules Committee meeting on Monday. After Hastings called Texas a 'crazy state', Burgess replied, saying it was 'very defamatory statement' that he refused to listen

North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, who was filling in for Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions as the panel's chairman, tried to step in by cutting off Hastings for interrupting Burgess. 

Burgess said: 'The gentleman made a very defamatory statement about my state and I will not stand here and listen to it.'

Hastings told Burgess he didn't have to listen, and replied: 'I told you what I think about Texas - I wouldn't live there for all the tea in China.' 

Burgess said that he did not see 'the value of a member in this rules committee hurling invective towards a state and it's people and its governor'.

The argument spawned out of a discussion over states that did not create their own insurance exchanges, or online price comparison websites where consumers can purchase health insurance, which are the topic of a pending Supreme Court Case. 

The discussion quickly digressed when Hastings criticized Burgess's state of Texas, according to Roll Call.

When Burgess asked for an apology, Hastings said he would have to 'wait until hell freezes over' for him to give an apology.

'I would apologize to you if I was directing my comments to you. I was commenting about the state that you happen to be a resident in,' he said. 

Burgess urged that Hasting's claims were 'uncalled for' and didn't understand why any lawmaker would say such a thing. 

Sessions returned at the end of the meeting, saying he 'became aware of the dialogue that took place'.

He went on to say: 'I love our United States. I would say it's a great country and for us to work together is important.'

The dispute underscored the debates that have long surrounded President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. 

The House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to roll back all or parts of the law.
