Robbie Mullen was bundled into a police van after giving his girlfriend Natalie Potter a kiss on the cheek

When Robbie Mullen planted an innocent peck on his girlfriend’s cheek over Sunday lunch, he never imagined it would see him bundled into a police van and warned about his behaviour.

Mr Mullen’s romantic gesture offended one diner so much that she complained to staff, who then asked the civil engineer and his partner Natalie Potter to move tables.

When he refused, the 43-year-old said he was ‘shocked’ to see four police officers arrive and march him outside where he was told he was not welcome in the restaurant.

Mr Mullen said yesterday: ‘It is ridiculous. It was just a kiss – it’s not like we were there with our tongues down each other’s throats.’ 

The trouble started after the Dunfermline couple went to The Crooked Glen restaurant at Fife Leisure Park in the town for a family meal with Miss Potter’s five-year-old son, Charlie, last month.

Miss Potter, 40, said they left Charlie in the soft play area and as the restaurant was busy, asked if they could share a large table nearby occupied by a lone man so they could keep an eye on the boy.

When the man was joined by his wife, Mr Mullen noticed that she ‘wasn’t happy’ to find she was now sharing her table.

He said: ‘It was packed and there weren’t any tables and there was one guy on his own. Natalie said can we sit there and he said no problem.

‘This woman turns up and right away I could see she wasn’t happy. We were ignoring them and just talking quietly and I leaned across and had a wee peck on the cheek, nothing more.

‘The woman drops her knife and fork and said, “That’s disgusting, I’m sat here trying to have meal with my husband.”’

Miss Potter added: ‘I said, “Beg your pardon” because I was really shocked and she said, “Get away from the table” and we just ignored her.’ 

Mr Mullen went on: ‘She goes and gets the manager, who comes over and says, “This lady wants you to move. Can you take your drinks through to the soft play area?”  She said, “I’m asking you nicely to move.”

‘The manager wanted to defuse the situation but she was siding with them, which got my back up a little bit so I said no, we hadn’t done anything. I said, “I’m not moving, you’re going to have to physically move me.” 

‘This was all said quietly, no raised voices. The manager went away – I thought maybe a bouncer or someone might come over.

‘The next thing I know two police came in and put their hands on my shoulder and asked me to go with them to answer questions. While I was in the van two more came up in another van. 

‘I thought something might  happen, but four policemen was a surprise. I told them what happened and they said it wasn’t a problem, but told me the manager never wants us back.

‘It was just a wee peck on the cheek.’ 

Miss Potter added: ‘They had Robbie in the back of a van and then another van arrived.

‘Just because he’s kissed me on the cheek they’ve been extremely offended by this but the place is full of families – I was there as a family. I was absolutely horrified – my son’s five and was petrified saying, “What have we done?” 

‘It was so embarrassing – people were looking at us as though we were criminals.’ 

Police Scotland confirmed officers attended the pub ‘following a report of a customer dispute with staff’ at 4.20pm on February 9. 

A spokesman said that the ‘situation was amicably resolved on police attendance’ and that no one was arrested or charged.

The Crooked Glen is run by the Brewers Fayre chain, part of the Whitbread Group, and advertises itself as a family and children-friendly environment.

A Brewers Fayre spokesman said: 'Having spoken to our team members at the Crooked Glen, we are satisfied that staff acted appropriately in this instance.

'On the day in question two customers sat down, uninvited, at a table where another couple were already dining.

'Having interrupted the couple's meal, they then began behaving in a way that other diners found excessive and inappropriate.

'Following complaints to staff, they were asked to move to another table, which they refused to do.

'They then started using abusive language towards other diners and staff, at which point the police were called. The incident was dealt with at the scene and no further action was needed.

'As a venue for thousands of family celebrations every week, we have no policy that prevents couples from giving each other a kiss on the cheek in our restaurants.'
