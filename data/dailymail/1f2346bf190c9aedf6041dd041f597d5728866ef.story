The American woman who accuses Dominique Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her in New York is now set to testify against him in Paris, it sensationally emerged today.

While Nafissatou Diallo's case against the former International Monetary Fund chief looks set to collapse in the U.S., she could yet see him brought to justice in his home city of Paris.

A lawyer for the 32-year-old confirmed that he had filed a complaint today accusing Strauss-Kahn's staff of interfering with a potential prosecution witness.

The witness is a past lover of Strauss-Kahn who claims he abused her while he was the mayor of the Paris suburb of Sarcelles.

Strauss-Kahn was already married to Anne Sinclair, his third wife, when he allegedly met the witness at a party organised by the French Socialist Party in 1997.

They became lovers within hours, it is claimed, even though she was just 23 and he was 47, and went on to meet regularly for almost a year.

But when their secret affair ended badly she is said to have tried to commit suicide because of Strauss-Kahn's abuse.

Paris-based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had today filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss-Kahn's legal team had 'put pressure' on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent.

This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover-up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness.

It would also allow Ms Diallo's legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss-Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution.

Mr De Montbrial said Strauss-Kahn's associates had clearly made an 'attempt at witness tampering' so as to scupper the New York case.

Strauss-Kahn is expected back in Paris this week because the New York prosecutor does not want to pursue the case against him.

There has even been talk of Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist politician, resuming his campaign to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as President of France next year.

Socialist Party chief Martine Aubry called it 'an immense relief' that prosecutors asked a judge to put an end to the case based on concerns about the accuser's credibility.

Ms Aubry said on France-Info radio today: 'We were all waiting for this ... for him to finally be able to get out of this nightmare.'

'Useful to his country': Socialist Party frontrunner Francois Hollande has backed Strauss-Kahn's political return

The man who replaced Strauss-Khan as favourite for the Socialist Party presidential nomination yesterday said the former IMF chief's political comeback could be 'envisaged'.

Francois Hollande told France Inter Radio: 'A man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss-Kahn can be useful to his country in the months and years to come.'

Although Strauss-Kahn has missed the July deadline for potential Socialist candidates to declare, several party heavyweights have previously suggested it pushed back.

But even if Strauss-Kahn is set free in the U.S., he is also facing an allegation that he tried to rape French writer Tristane Banon, 32, in a Paris flat in 2003.

He mother, 65-year-old Anne Mansouret, has also told how Strauss-Kahn had 'brutal but consensual' sex with her in his Paris office.

Strauss-Kahn, who is currently living in New York with no bail conditions, denies all the charges aimed at him in both the U.S. and France.
