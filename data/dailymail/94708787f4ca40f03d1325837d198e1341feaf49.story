 World of Warcraft is the most popular 'online world' ever created - host to 10 million gamers who explore its Tolkien-esque world to battle huge monsters, or just fight and trade with each other.

But new rival Star Wars: the Old Republic has gained ground on the gaming juggernaut - hitting a million subscribers faster than any 'massively multiplayer' online game, including Warcraft.

The game, from cult studio Bioware, won 105 awards, and uses voice acting throughout - as well as the universe of Yoda and Darth Vader. It hit a score of 88 on review-aggregator site Metacritic - the highest for any online 'world' game this year.

Warcraft recently lost two million subscribers as users complained about the game growing stale - and Electronic Arts's big-budget challenger seems to be ideally placed to pick up these jaded fans.

Players can opt to play as lightsaber-wielding Jedi or evil Sith - you can't play as famous characters such as Darth Vader, but a few famous faces crop up throughout the game

'Massively multiplayer' games such as Star Wars: the Old Republic allow tens of thousands of players to adventure together - battling monsters together or battling one another to become more powerful

Many games have attempted the feat - including several with well-known characters such as Conan the Barbarian - but
 the Old Republic is hotly tipped to do it, thanks to the familiar Star 
Wars universe, a rumoured £100-million-plus budget, and the fact that 
Warcraft subscribers seem to be tiring of the game's fantasy world, with
 two million leaving in the past year.

The game officially launched on December 20. For gamers, it's easily the biggest launch in a genre that's been ruled single-handedly by Warcraft for more than five years. 'It's happening. It's finally happening,' said game site IGN last week.

The game's maker, Electronic Arts, was once the biggest game publisher in the world, but lost ground to rival Activision when Activision acquired Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft in 2008.

The game scored 88 per cent on 'review aggregator' site Metracritic - being praised for its lush graphics, involving plot and vivid game world

Unlike Warcraft, Old Republic uses recorded voice dialogue, rather than text - it has a more voice acting than any previous game, online or off

The game has seen the previous Star Wars online 'world' - Star Wars: Galaxies - switched off, with an announcement that the Rebel Alliance had 'won'.

But while previews and gamer reaction to the game is generally good, others are less sure about the business model. The game has been astronomically expensive for Electronic Arts, and faces competition from other, free, online games.

Frank Gibeau, President of Electronic Arts, said to Gamesindustry.biz, 'I wish it wasn't so expensive. I think everybody does.'

The business model where gamers pay for discs, then pay to subscribe, is also under threat.

Many games, such as Sony's DC Universe Online, have switched to a 'free to play' system similar to Facebook games, where the game itself is free, but users pay to upgrade their character with powerful items or new outfits.

Gaming site Eurogamer described the game as 'the end of an era' - saying that it's arrived as the world of online gaming changes forever.

The game lets players battle monsters - or one another, with the players split into two factions. The resulting mix ensures that both pacifists and more warlike players are catered for

The Old Republic does have new ideas, though such as voice acting throughout the game - giving Old Republic a more story-driven feel. It's also driven the price up hugely.

World of Warcraft has had up to
 12 million monthly subscribers, earning the company a reported $500 
million a year in subscription fees - on top of disc prices for the game
 and its four expansions. The game has been running since 2004.

The game includes hundreds of planets to explore - gamers can captain spaceships, command crews, make millions, and even turn to the Dark Side

The game also has voice acting throughout - 
and a greater focus on story than rival Warcraft, which gamers sometimes
 complain has 'hamster wheel'-like qualities, as they're forced to 
repeat tasks to earn in-game rewards.

The world of Old Republic is far bigger than the world of the films - but  gamers should expect to meet familiar faces
