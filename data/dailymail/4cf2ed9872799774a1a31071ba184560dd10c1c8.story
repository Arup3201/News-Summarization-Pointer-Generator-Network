Mario Balotelli has reacted to Italy fans who have questioned his commitment to the national side by saying he has 'given everything' for his country.

Some fans have questioned whether he is 'really Italian' following Italy's group stage exit at the World Cup in Brazil, with Balotelli having been born to Ghanaian immigrant parents.

The striker was adopted by an Italian family in Naples and grew up there but he has been on the receiving end of racist chanting and slurs during matches for club side AC Milan.

Following the criticism he posted a heated response on Instagram, defending his nationality but also making claims that he is perhaps more 'African' in some ways than 'Italian'.

The 23-year-old, who has scored 13 goals in 32 appearances for Italy, said: 'I am proud to have given everything for my country.'

'Mario Balotelli has given everything to the national team and has not made a mistake.

'Perhaps, as some of you say, I'm not really Italian. The Africans wouldn't have blamed one of their brothers. Never. In this, we black, as you call us, we are light years ahead of you.

'Disgrace is not one that misses a goal or runs less or more. Disgraceful are these things [unjustified comments made to Balotelli].'

Italy were eliminated from the World Cup following their 1-0 defeat to Uruguay on Tuesday and their 1-0 loss to Costa Rica.

They did beat England 2-1, however, to condemn Roy Hodgson's men to bottom of Group D - and Balotelli grabbed the winner with a header.

VIDEO Milan chief defends Balotelli

The former Manchester City player has often been caught up in controversy on and off the pitch, revealing a 'Why always me?' T-shirt when he scored for the Sky Blues against rivals Manchester United, and he was also sent off against Arsenal in a crucial match.

He scored 30 goals in 80 appearances for City between 2010 and 2013.

Following Italy's exit from the World Cup, head coach Cesare Prandelli resigned his post.

Former City boss Roberto Mancini is among the favourites to take over.
