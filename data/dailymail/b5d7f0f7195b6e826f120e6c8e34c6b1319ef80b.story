India's 'Elephant man' has turned down the opportunity to get a new face so he can pay for his daughter's wedding.

Mannan Mondal, who is also known as the 'melted man' of Delhi, has refused radical reconstructive surgery so he can continue begging.

The 50-year old, who suffers from neurofibromatosis - which means he has a high risk of growing tumours - relies on his appearance to make a living.

So he has rejected the offer from surgeons in a bid to fund 20-year-old Rasheeda's big day.

Refused: Mannan Mondal, 50, who begs in Delhi, has turned down radical reconstructive surgery so he can carry on begging and pay for his daughter's wedding

Opportunity: He received a consultation and surgeons said he could have a new face constructed, but rejected the offer

'I will have to buy a lot of things - beds, cabinets, rings, watches and a cycle for the groom,' said Mannan, who is missing an eye, an ear and most of his teeth.

'The money I earn while begging is barely enough to feed my family. But I have no other way to help my daughter. I have to continue like this. I have to think about feeding my family first.'

Mannan was born to an impoverished family in Kolkata, West Bengal, and opportunities were already limited.

But he was further shunned because of his appearance and banned from school - leaving begging as his only option.

Despite his condition he found love at 18 and now has two sons and two daughters to provide for.

Beg: He says he will need to pay for 'beds, cabinets, rings, watches and a cycle for the groom,' when it comes to his 20-year-old daughter, Rasheeda's, big day

He travels across India begging at holy sites, earning about £5 a day to send back to his beloved family. None of them have inherited the condition.

He said: 'I have been like this since birth. I was born poor and I had limited options. When I was younger these deformities were much smaller but they have all grown much larger with age.

'People around me do not treat me very well. They are disgusted by me and don't like me. This is how it has been for years.

'I have learned to manage like this. For example, I don't use a toothbrush to brush my teeth. I use my fingers as I have only four teeth.

'I do not have a home. I live on the streets under tents pitched on the footpath and I do not have money to buy land or houses.

Condition: Mannan suffers from Neurofibromatosis, which means he has a high risk of growing tumours

Making a living: He travels across India begging , earning about £5 a day to send back to his beloved family. None of them have inherited the condition

'But my wife and family have been very supportive. They have always told me that my condition is God's creation. We humans cannot do anything to avoid it.'

Mannan had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life-limiting.

But only last month he was given a thorough consultation by Dr Ajay Kashyap, director of Plastic Surgery, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, in Gurgaon.

He determined Mannan suffers from a type of neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition which causes uncontrollable growths along the nerves.

The condition made headlines when 53-year-old Italian Vinicio Riva - who suffers from a similar condition - was kissed by Pope Francis at the Vatican last year.

Dr Kashyap said: 'Mannan's tumours are benign, they are not cancerous. They will not shorten his life expectancy.

'But the bones have not developed 
properly on one side of his face so he has no support and this has 
caused the tumour to drop down.

'To
 reconstruct his face we would have to take away as much of the tumour 
as possible. After that, we would reconstruct the vital parts of his 
face he is missing.

Prognosis: Mannan had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life-limiting

Struggle: Mannan has suffered from the condition since he was a child, but still managed to find love at 18 and now has a family

'We could give him a new mouth, some kind of an eye socket and some skeletal support to make his appearance as normal as possible.

'But even after the procedure, he would not be 100 per cent normal. My main aim would be to give him some comfort and to make him and his children feel like he is normal.'

Surprisingly Mannan has turned his back on this opportunity - and vowed to continue begging.

He feels this is his career and his sole option to make enough money to provide for his family.

'If there was an option of getting better without having to pay then I would definitely take it,' he said.

'But not now. I have a wedding to think about. I will have to go back home, talk to my family and then decide. But feeding my family will always come first.'

While modern medicine can finally offer Mannan the chance of a new face - and a new life - it may have come too late for him.

And so tonight, as for most nights in the last 50 years, he will once again be back on the streets plying his trade.

Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome

Slamet is 
believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the
 name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of 
their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a 
gene mutation before they are born.

There
 are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type 
one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. 

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

The
 condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name 
given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured.

However,
 in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had 
Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms 
such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head.

The
 confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had
 suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and 
Proteus syndrome.

However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive.

Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin.

These
 harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many 
people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a 
centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. 

NF1
 is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop 
gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary 
considerably from person to person.

People
 with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and 
behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral 
nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1
 over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved 
spine.
