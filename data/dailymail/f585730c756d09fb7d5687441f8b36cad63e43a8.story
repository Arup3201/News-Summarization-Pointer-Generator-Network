A Park Avenue-raised heroin addict who was last week charged with keeping high-powered explosives in her Greenwich Village apartment was already a suspect in a robbery.

Morgan Gliedman, 27, was also already on probation for drug possession after a Washington Heights drug bust in February, when she was taken into police custody on Saturday where she gave birth to a daughter named Melody.

On February 17, Gliedman met a man at Johnny's Bar in the Village and went to his Midtown apartment where she allegedly took off with a backpack containing his laptop, cellphone, wallet and credit cards, which she used to make purchases.

Gliedman hasn't yet been charged in the theft, according to The New York Post.

Five days after the robbery, on February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, and father of her child, Aaron Greene were arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle, The Post reported.

The couple were spotted with another woman in a car that was parked at West 176th Street and Haven Avenue. Greene, 31, was seen injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal complaint said.

Police officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun.

'I have a... rifle in the trunk,' he told officers, according to the complaint.

He was sentenced to five months in 
jail. Gliedman was due to complete pre-trial probation for drug 
possession next week, but that case now could be reopened because of the
 weekend's explosive find.

Despite explosives and a cache of weapons being found at their apartment, police said Gliedman, the daughter of a top New 
York doctor, and Greene are not home-grown terrorists.

Greene's
 father is the head of a top art restoration firm. He was also arrested 
in the apartment on Saturday and is being held without bail on Rikers 
Island.

eighbors say the couple lived in squalor in their home in the pricy Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village.

'It looks like they’re junkies, well-to-do junkies, not terrorists,' a police source told the Daily Beast.

real estate agent

Inside the apartment, officers found 
seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the 
substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings.

The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive.

Police
 also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting 
shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a 
replica of an M203 grenade launcher.

Several disturbing items were seized, 
including: 'The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and 
Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself 
Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby 
traps and explosives.

The New York Post reported
 that Greene was a member of Occupy Wall Street, though an NYPD 
spokesman told MailOnline that his connection to the group was still 
being investigated.

Two spokesmen for the Occupy movement said they had never heard of Greene.

Officers
 were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and 
Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to 
their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported.

The apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street, is near the apartment where two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970.

Greene and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast.

Neighbors said Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York real estate agent, visited her often at the Greenwich apartment.

Her father is Dr Paul Gleidman, the Columbia University-educated director of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Hospital's Brooklyn division.

Gliedman
 gave birth to her baby daughter on Saturday at St. Luke's Hospital, 
where she is currently resting. She has not yet been arraigned, though 
she remains under arrest, The Post reported.

She attended Dalton School, an exclusive New York prep school attended by the likes of Anderson Cooper and Claire Danes. Her Facebook friend list is reportedly a who's-who of New York society.

She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing.

Greene claims he went to Harvard University for his undergraduate degree and did graduate work at the Kennedy School of Government there.
