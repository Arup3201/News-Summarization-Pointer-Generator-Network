A former TV news reporter is claiming to be psychic after sending text messages to himself to 'prove' he can see into the future.

John Thomson, from Bristol, started ‘feeling and seeing’ words and phrases in March last year and because he didn’t think anyone would believe him decided to log them on his phone.

The 44-year-old says by having the messages dated on his phone before the events happen, it proves he is psychic.

Foresight: Messages come to John in the form of phrases starting with a different word and then finishing '...comes to you'

Messages come to Mr Thomson in the form of phrases starting with a different word and then finishing '...comes for you'.

On August 6 this year Mr Thomson sent himself a text after seeing the words ‘Manilla comes for you’ the day before a deadly hurricane struck the Philippines.

And in the first week of October Mr Thomson said he saw the words ‘Haemorrage comes to you’ days before a man came to the UK suffering and later dying from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which sparked a nationwide health scare.

Mr Thomson, who used to work for Scotland's STV, can have up to 20 visions a day.

He is now a full-time author and has published a book about his experiences entitled ‘Seer (The Man Who Sees Tomorrow).

He said: 'When I first started to see the phrases I was worried what it meant, was it coming for me?

Mr Thomson said: I had one saying 'the witness comes for you' then the next day it was announced Iran had been launched a military drone, pictured, called The Shahed - which means 'Witness'

'The visions if you like started to occur in March 2011 that’s when I started to experience seeing things, well probably more like sensing them.

'I used to work as a reporter so having a background in news I wanted to note these experiences down, because I didn’t always have a notebook I decided sending a text to myself was just as good and it meant I had a record of them.

'It was in August last year when I had gone to visit my parents when I first realised what these visions meant. I had a vision of the phrase ‘Manilla is coming for you’ so I sent it to myself in a text.'

The next day Mr Thomson  said he was walking past the TV and he saw the news about a hurricane hitting the Far East country leaving many dead.

Mr Thomson said: 'The visions seem to be more about global events not just about Britain, I had one saying ‘the witness comes for you’ then the next day it was announced Iran had been launched a military drone called The Shahed - which means ‘Witness’.

'I can have anything from three or five to 20 visions a day and I’m sorry to say that they are not all good, but I feel that whatever happens, be it bad or good, it happens for a reason.

'I have been asked if I got a vision about something bad happening would I try and do anything about it?

'Say I was around when JFK got shot and I had a vision a few days before, the answer is I would have told people, but these experiences are prophetic, you can’t stop them happening.”

Mr Thomson admits his seeings will sound mad or even insane to some people but he wants to use his ‘gift’ to help others.

Mr Thomson said he had offered the police information about some ongoing investigations and hoped he could help again.
