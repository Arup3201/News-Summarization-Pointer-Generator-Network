Promise: David Cameron, pictured arriving in Prague today for the funeral of Vaclav Havel, has pledged not to give up the Falkland's sovereignty

In a Christmas message to the Falkland Islands, Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted Britain will not give up their sovereignty.

He pledged: 'We will never negotiate on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless you, the Falkland Islanders, so wish.

'No democracy could ever do otherwise.'

His statement comes days after Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner claimed Britain was ready to use force to seize other countries' natural resources 'anywhere, anyhow'.

Mrs Kirchner pledged an 'eternal fight' for the disputed islands which Britain has held since the 1830s and fought a brief but bloody war over in 1982.

Cameron also used the message to insist that Britain wanted to work with Argentina.

He said in his statement: 'It is in our interests that we have a constructive relationship with Argentina.

'There is common ground to be found on issues like the global economy and climate change.

He continued: 'We want to work with Argentina on those issues.

'But
the Argentine government has continued to make statements which 
challenge your right to self-determination, and we can never accept 
that.'

Argentina has repeatedly claimed 
ownership of the Falklands and the dispute has escalated since the 
exploration for oil in in the islands' territorial waters in recent years.

There were newspaper reports yesterday claiming that Argentina has prepared secret plans for a new invasion.

Diplomacy: Uruguay President Jose Mujia and Mrs Kirchner at the Mercosur summit in Montevideo. He claims the decision to ban Falklands flagged shipping was purely economic

Foreign Secretary William Hague is today due
to try and defuse the situation by phoning his Uruguayan counterpart
to discuss his country's support of a shipping ban on 
Falkland Islands vessels introduced earlier this week.

Mr Hague arranged to speak 
by phone with Luis Almagro about the powerful regional trading bloc 
Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, which has banned 
ships flying the Falkland Islands flag from docking in their ports.

Mr Hague was expected to tell Mr Almagro that the ban is unfair and to urge Uruguay to reconsider its stance to avoid damaging relations between the two countries.

He was also set to reiterate Britain's determination to protect the right of Falklanders to determine their future.

Uruguayan president Jose Mujica has already sought to ease tension by insisting he had nothing against the UK and admitting he supported the ban for economic reasons.

Writing on an official presidential 
website, he said his primary concerns were his country's tourism and 
construction industries and bilateral trade between Uruguay and 
Argentina.

Argentina yesterday imposed tough new limits on foreign ownership of farmland. Voted 62-1 by the senate, it stops non-Argentines from holding title to more than 2,500 acres.

It also means across the nationÂ  no more than 15 per cent of the farmland can be sold to foreigners, and no more than 30 per cent of foreign-owned land can be held by people from the same nationality.

Exceptions include foreigners who are married to Argentine citizens, have Argentine children or have five years of permanent residency.

He added: 'Whenever relations with Argentina deteriorate, our economy and employment suffers.'

The growing tension lead to a call from former Navy chief Lord West, a veteran of the 1982 conflict, for a military show of force.

Richard Ottaway, chairman of the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, responded by asking Mr Hague to act swiftly to stop the diplomatic row worsening.

In another development Mrs Kirchner yesterday named a replacement ambassador to Britain ahead of the 
30th anniversary of the Falklands War in April.

The post has been vacant for more than two years since Frederico Mirre retired at the end of 2008.

Mrs
Kirchner decided against sending a replacement in protest at British 
government support for the start of new oil exploration around the 
disputed Falkland Islands.

A
new ambassador was not expected to be named until the end of 2012.

New boss: Argentina will appoint a new ambassador to London for the first time since 2008

The dispute over the Falklands began to escalate in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands.

Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016.

Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers.
