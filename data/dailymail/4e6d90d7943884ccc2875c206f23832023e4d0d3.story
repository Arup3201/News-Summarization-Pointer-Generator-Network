A mother fighting cancer has given birth to a healthy baby girl.

Heather Choate of Bayfield, Colorado learned she had breast cancer while 10 weeks pregnant with her sixth child, and was urged to terminate her pregnancy for her own health.

Choate however said she would rather die than get rid of her baby, and on January 6 gave birth to a daughter, Kiery Celeste.

Choate was urged to terminate the pregnancy and seek treatment but refused, and gave birth to Kiery Celeste (above) on January 6

Then the family got some even better news this week, when Choate learned that she was cancer free. 

'I just got tears really in my eyes because that means we’ve done it — we have a baby here and things are looking good,' Choate told CBS Denver. 

The 29-year-old gives most of the credit to Dr. Virginia Borges, who found a way to treat the mother while she was pregnant.

The mother says she will get through the rest of her recovery with the help of her family (above) and her faith 

Dr. Borges, who specializes in breast cancer in young woman, found a way to give Choate chemotherapy and perform surgery while not hurting her unborn child.

And while there is still more chemotherapy and radiation in Choate's future, she is certain she can get through it with her 'family and faith.'

Choate's husband Ben says he feels 'relief and joy' that he not only has a new baby, but that his wife is on the path to recovery.
