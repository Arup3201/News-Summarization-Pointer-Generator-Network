Bobbi Kristina Brown's relatives have denied report that they are  part of a reality TV show which shows them coming to terms with the singer being in an induced coma in hospital.

A source had previously told TMZ at least three relatives of the 21-year-old's father Bobby Brown have taken part in the unnamed show, part of which documents Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life.

'Yet again, TMZ has chosen to engage in false news reporting,' said Brown’s attorney Christopher Brown.

Brown's attorney then added in a statement to RumorFix; 'There is no Brown family reality show that is in production which chronicles Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina or the medical emergency she presently faces at Emory Hospital. These reports are irresponsible and Warner Brothers as the owner of TMZ, should be ashamed to publish such nonsense, particularly one day before Bobbi Kristina’s birthday.'

He ended by saying; 'Bobbi Kristina and Bobby Brown are dealing with enough right now. The fact that TMZ/Warner Brothers has decided to inject negativity into their lives at this critical time is plain insanity.' 

Whitney Houston's daughter remains in a serious condition after being found unconscious in a bathtub at her home on January 31. 

There are already reportedly tensions between her family members.

Last month Bobby Brown's sister allegedly smacked her son in the head with a bottle during a hotel fight after the family gathered in Atlanta to be at Bobbi Kristina's  bedside.

Tina Brown hit Shayne Brown in the head with a bottle at the bar of the W. Midtown Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police report.

Shayne Brown then drove himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for lacerations to the side of the head, while Tina Brown took off before police arrived, according to the report.

The police report noted that the family had been at a birthday party for Bobby Brown - who had just turned 46 - when the mother and son started arguing over a valet parking ticket. 

There are also tensions between family members and her boyfriend Nick Gordon, who launched a Twitter rant against Bobby Brown last week.

Gordon, who has reportedly been banned from visiting Bobbi Kristina, told Brown to 'grow up' - insisting she will hate him when she wakes up.

The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before Bobbi Kristina was found face down in a bathtub. 

Gordon also insisted he has taken care of his girlfriend '24/7' since her mother died in 2012.

Last Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown.

The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.'

He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.'

Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Houston's legacy

Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks 

Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR 

The messages were  deleted from his profile but he later wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy.

Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs.' 

He added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.'

Doctors were unable to take Bobbi Kristina out of her medically-induced coma last week.

The 21-year-old, who is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, began having seizures when they began taking her off various medications, it was reported. 

It was then decided to keep her in the coma.

Last week, she was given a tracheotomy.

Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, Bobby Brown, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition.  

A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions.

'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told E!.

But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit.

They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public.

The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown. 

A  report which surfaced last month claimed  Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub.

In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. 

Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago.

One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. 

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married.
