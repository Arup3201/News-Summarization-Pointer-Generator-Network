Two girls accused of carrying out a robbery posed for a selfie while wearing balaclavas and brandishing a knife.

Police arrested the pair and found the picture of them on a mobile phone together in front of a mirror.

The girls, who are cousins, are accused of stealing 2,420 kronor (£240) during the robbery at a fast food restaurant in Halmstad, Sweden.

The pair allegedly threatened workers with a large kitchen knife and said 'give me the money otherwise I'll stab you'.

It is claimed the shopkeeper replied 'calm down,'I'll open the till' during the robbery in March, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported.

Only one of the two girls, who is aged 17, is old enough to be reported, Gawker reported.

Police arrested the pair when they raided the property that they share with their grandparents.
