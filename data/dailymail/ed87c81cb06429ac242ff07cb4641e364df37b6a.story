She's built up a successful diet and exercise brand, as well as her very own 'Booty Camp', in the wake of her departure from The Only Way Is Essex late last year.

And now Lucy Mecklenburgh is also proving her worth as a model, too.

The former TOWIE star is helping Superdrug celebrate a milestone as it reaches its 50th birthday.

What a difference! Lucy Mecklenburgh has been treated to a series of makeovers from the past 50 years to celebrate Superdrug's 50th birthday. Speaking about this 80s material girl look, she said: 'I love the funky thick black eyeliner - this is actually a really cool look'

To celebrate, DARE, Superdrug’s customer magazine, worked with Lucy to recreate five iconic looks from the last fifty years of beauty.

The 22-year-old was given a 60s Twiggy-inspired makeover, a 70s disco look, as well as 80s material girl, 90s 'fresh' and a modern-day bronzed beauty. 

Speaking about the shoot, Lucy said: 'My favourite look today has definitely been the 1960s Twiggy look, I love it. I love this style and have always wanted to try Twiggy eye make-up.'

Lucy said the 70s disco look made her feel 'really glamorous' and described the 80s look as 'really cool.' 

70s disco: Lucy said of this look: 'The metallic eyes and strong red lips make me feel really glamorous!'

90s fresh: Speaking about her urban makeover, Lucy said: 'I like this look.  Everything I need to create it is already in my make-up bag'

'I actually liked all of them,' she added. 'Today’s 'bronzed beauty' is how I wear my make-up now. I also like being bronzed a la Kim Kardashian.'

Charmian Harris, editor of DARE Magazine said: 'Working with Lucy on this shoot was loads of fun, she loves beauty and was involved in styling the looks to give her own unique interpretation of beauty through the decades.'

Aside from her modelling duties, Lucy was seen relaxing on the beach in Dubai earlier this month.

Slipping
 into a skimpy white bikini, the 22-year-old reality star displayed her 
killer tan and envy-inducing hourglass curves as she soaked up the sun 
in the Middle Eastern holiday hotspot. 

Lucy threw herself into a
 vigorous diet and exercise regime in the wake of her painful split from
 co-star fiance, Mario Falcone, last April.

But the svelte 9st 5ft 6in star has since admitted she got 'too skinny' at one point.

She
 said: 'When I started training for the first time last January, 
exercise started out as the thing that made me happy at a time when I 
felt sad. It got me out the other end.

'I still love exercise but, back then, it was more of an addiction and, at one point, I was too thin.'

She
 recently told MailOnline of her healthy approach to life: 'I think it's
 normal for people to lose weight through anxiety after a break-up. I 
would just advise women to not overdo it. I feel more confident, I am aware of what I eat and I have so much more energy.'

Her typical daily diet now consists 
of eggs with smoked salmon for breakfast, sushi or salad for lunch and 
fish or meat with quinoa and vegetables for dinner, all washed down with
 lots of peppermint tea.

Reminding
 us that she's still mortal, Lucy has a treat day and loves a huge bowl 
of spaghetti bolognaise with lots of cheese, as well as a piece of apple
 crumble or chocolate brownie with her Sunday roast dinner.

She
 added: 'I love going for drinks with the girls, it's how I relax after a
 long day. I just opt for vodka and steer clear of sugary cocktails.

'We need to realise that we are just addicted to sugar, we don't need it. I banned it for two weeks and never craved it again.'

DARE magazine’s Superdrug 50th Birthday special edition launches on 9th April at Superdrug stores nationally, a digital version will also be available to download.  Behind the scenes videos of Lucy on the shoot can be viewed at Dare.Superdrug.com.
