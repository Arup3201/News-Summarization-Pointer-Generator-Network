Aid target: Mark Lowcock, Permanent Secretary of the Department for International Development, was given the handout last year

The head of Britain’s foreign aid department was handed a bonus of almost £20,000 as it met a target to spend billions more on overseas development.

Mark Lowcock, Permanent Secretary of the Department for International Development, was given the handout last year, the ministry’s annual report for 2013/14 shows.

Despite concerns over whether millions of pounds of aid money were being spent effectively, he received the bonus of between £15,000 and £20,000 on top of his salary of almost £165,000.

Critics last night said the bonus was yet another example of the aid department’s profligacy.

It comes after the damning conclusion of auditors that DfID splurged £1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the Coalition commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid.

The National Audit Office said the fact that the funds were spent so quickly raised serious questions about whether value for money was achieved.

The Coalition commitment to the 0.7 per cent target meant that DfID had to spend £11.46billion on aid projects in 2013.

In June 2013, DfID officials forecast that they would have to spend £2.7billion in November and December to hit the target.

However, months later – under the leadership of Mr Lowcock – the department found it had to spend an extra £1billion on top of this to hit the 0.7 per cent target. This extra money was then allocated to different schemes over a period of only eight weeks.

The NAO report tops a series of failings at the department. Two months ago an independent report found that DfID programmes were making corruption worse in Nigeria and Nepal.

The department’s annual report for 2013/14 also shows that DfID’s director general Richard Calvert received a bonus of between £10,000 and £15,000 in addition to his £130,000 pay.

DfID said the payments to Mr Lowcock and Mr Calvert were based on objectives reached in the year 2012/13.

Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘People will be pretty surprised in my constituency to hear about this bonus payment. £20,000 is more than many people in Wellingborough earn in a year, and many of them have had to endure pay freezes.

‘Now we have criticism from the NAO saying that they gave away lots of money at the end of the year to meet the 0.7 per cent target, raising questions about value for money.’

The DfID report shows that as well as his large bonus, Mr Lowcock has amassed a pension pot of almost £1million, entitling him to an annual payment of almost £60,000 when he retires.

Auditors concluded DfID splurged £1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the Coalition commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid

The report reveals that the number of staff at DfID has risen by 7.3 per cent in the past year to 2,972, despite David Cameron’s pledge to cut the cost of government. The wage bill soared 8.8 per cent to £145.7million last year.

At the same time, other departments’ budgets were reduced.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘DfID looks like a black hole for taxpayers’ cash.

‘Each penny of foreign aid should go to the world’s poorest, and the arbitrary way in which the department spends at the minute isn’t contributing enough to freedom, health or safety in the developing world.’

A DfID spokesman said: ‘The payments in question related to staff performance in the 2012/13 financial year, not 2013/14 when the UK first achieved the 0.7 per cent aid target.

'Furthermore, these salaries and performance payments are funded from the core administration budget which is entirely separate from the budget which is used to finance overseas aid programmes.

'They are paid in line with standard Civil Service rules and an independently-chaired Remuneration Committee advises on all pay and bonus awards for Permanent Secretaries.'

He said DfID has reduced its admin budget by a third, reduced spending on admin consultants in DfID by 90 per cent, clamped down on the travel policy for staff and reformed aid spending.
