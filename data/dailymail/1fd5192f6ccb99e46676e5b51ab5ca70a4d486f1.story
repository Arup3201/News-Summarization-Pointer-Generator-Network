Half of American voters think that congressional Republican's inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak on Capitol Hill was a bad idea, a new poll shows.

Forty-eight per cent of respondents in a new poll say they disapproved of Republican House Speaker John Boehner offering the Middle Eastern leader an invitation to speak to Congress without first clearing it with President Obama.

Thirty per cent of all respondents favored letting Netanyahu speak, with more than 20 per cent saying they didn't know enough to answer. The Israeli leader landed in Washington on Sunday night.

Responses to questions about the speech, planned for Tuesday, largely broke down along party lines, the poll from the Wall Street Journal and NBC shows.

Nearly half, 47 per cent, of Republicans asked about the address said that they supported the move, compared to 28 per cent who oppose it.

Just 12 per cent of Democrats said they were behind letting the Israeli leader, who faces an election in several weeks, speak without Obama's approval. Sixty-six per cent disapproved of it. 

While the relationship between Netanyahu and Obama has deteriorated over America's nuclear program negotiations with Iran, the percentage of Americans who looked favorably on the prime minister has increased.

Thirty per cent now think positively about the right-wing Likud leader, up from 24 per cent in August, right after Israel's large-scale bombing operation in the Gaza Strip. 

Views of the prime minister, who also held the post in the late 1990s, were also split by party, with 49 per cent of Republicans holding a positive view compared to only 12 per cent of Democrats.

The relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu has become strained because of American negotiations with Iran

Despite the controversy inspired by its leader, American's views of Israel as a country continue to be strong.

Forty-seven per cent of the US electorate view Israel as a country in a good light, compared to 17 per cent negative.

Netanyahu's visit is seen as possibly upsetting delicate negotiations over limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting crippling sanctions.

Proposed legislation in Congress would levy additional economic restrictions on the country that many Israelis consider their biggest security threat if talks fall through.

Obama has decided not to meet with the prime minister during his visit and some Democratic members of Congress have said they will not attend his speech.

The Israeli leader will also speak at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference on Monday. 

While it may be causing disagreements in Washington, half of Americans had not read or seen coverage of Netanyahu's visit to the US.

The poll was conducted on Wednesday through Sunday and surveyed 800 registered voters. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46 percentage points.
