Chris Bryant said the 'cover-up' at News International extended to James Murdoch

Phone-hacking will be the single largest corporate corruption case for 250 years and the 'cover up' went up 'to the very highest levels', a senior Labour MP sensationally claimed today.

Speaking at a private members' debate held in Westminster Hall, Chris Bryant claimed the scandal at News International extended to executives and chairman James Murdoch. He said that senior figures 'ordered - we know this for sure - the mass destruction of evidence'.

Mr Bryant claimed: 'There was a major cover-up at 
News International which stretched right up to the very highest levels 
of the company, as we know even up to James Murdoch.

'And that, in the 
end, I suspect, will prove to have been the biggest crime.'

The politician made his dramatic claims as court papers alleged that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire provided the News of the World with daily transcripts of hacked messages.

The papers said voicemail interception was approved by at least two executives, the Daily Telegraph reported. Three senior figures figures on the paper were in frequent contact with Mulcaire, it is claimed.

The documents say he entered into a conspiracy with executives and 'agreed to provide daily transcripts of voicemail messages to [NGN] journalists.'

As the hacking controversy deepened today, Mr Bryant insisted U.S. authorities had a duty to investigate because members of the News Corp board, which is based in America, had failed to prevent staff paying off public officials despite 'incontrovertible evidence'. 

Mr Bryant claimed Parliament has been told 486 lies about the phone-hacking affair, by News International, police and other organisations.

He also said he was 'absolutely sure' that the problems seen at News 
International 'may well have been replicated' at other newspapers.

Mr Bryant, the Rhondda MP, received £30,000 in compensation from News International last month after his phone was hacked.

He said News Corporation directors were at fault for not stopping the attempt to disguise what was going on within the company.

He said: 'Senior figures at News International ordered - we know this for sure - the mass destruction of evidence.

'The clear, incontrovertible evidence of 
corrupt payments to police, which News International had garnered 
together, they gave to lawyers and squirrelled away and only revealed to
 the public very recently - I believe that aspect is one of the things 
that the authorities in the United States of America should be 
investigating because I don't believe that a single member of the board 
of directors of News Corp took their responsibilities in this regard 
seriously enough to prevent the payment of corrupt officials.'

Mr Bryant said police apparently told Rebekah Brooks about the original phone hacking investigation

As the Labour politician spoke out, Mr Justice Vos ordered that previously redacted court documents submitted for a phone-hacking case in the High Court should be released.

The papers revealed the victims wanted News Group Newspapers, the publishers of the NotW to admit that every one of the 6,000 people named in Mulcaire's notebook was a hacking victim.

Mulcaire and Clive Goodman were both jailed in 2007 after hacking the phones of senior members of the royal household.

Mulcaire has not accepted any of the allegations contained in the court documents - and was opposed to them being released today.

Today Mr Bryant also pointed to the 'shocking' revelation that police officers apparently gave Rebekah Brooks details about the original phone-hacking investigation.

He claimed this shows that 'the police effectively became a partly-owned subsidiary of News International'.

Earlier this week it emerged Scotland Yard told Mrs Brooks in 
2006 that there were up to 110 victims of phone hacking at the NotW.

Police
 had seemed to give Ms Brooks, then editor of The Sun, an incredibly 
detailed briefing about their investigation into the scandal within 
weeks of the arrest of News of the World royal editor Goodman and 
private detective Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking.

Mr Bryant said: 'This
 is like the FBI going to Don Corleone and telling him that he's got a 
bit of information on what his family has been up to.'

The
 explosive claims came from an email between Tom Crone, head of legal at
 the News of the World and Andy Coulson, the paper's then editor at 10.34am on September 15, 2006.

In addition, Mr Bryant claimed: 'People right at the top of the News of the 
World knew in 2006 exactly what had gone on.'

Mr Bryant used his speech to call for a powerful new media watchdog to be 
set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal - and not just the 
Press Complaints Commission 'dressed up in a new fur coat'.

Communications minister Ed Vaizey 
said he did not want to pre-judge the findings of the Leveson Inquiry 
but added it was 'no secret' the Government favoured independent 
regulation.

He said: 'This independence from state intervention is fundamental to our democratic way of life.'
