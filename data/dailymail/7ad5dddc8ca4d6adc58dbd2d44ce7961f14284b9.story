A mother was jailed today for stealing money from her sister's struggling electrical company to fund her own luxury holidays. 

Divorcee Deborah Price, 56, turned to her businesswoman sister for help when she was made redundant while bringing up three sons on her own.

A court heard her sister Kenis and brother-in-law Gareth Thomas gave her a job in the wages department of their electrical firm.

When asked why she stole from her sister, Price said: 'Because it was so easy.'

Prosecutor Lowri Wyn Morgan said: 'Price was employed in the family company with sole responsibility for the company accounts.

'At one point her sister and husband were forced to sink their savings into the business to pay salaries.

'But all the time Price was stealing from them.'

Price was caught when Mr Thomas checked the accounts and noticed she had paid herself twice in one month.

Mrs
Morgan said: 'She said it was a mistake but when he checked back he 
found 18 separate occasions when she had transferred money into her own 
accounts.

'The Thomases confronted her and she said she was sorry and that she had done it because it was so easy.'

In
a statement to Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court Mr Thomas, 57, said he and 
his wife had been left 'devastated' by Price's betrayal which has torn 
the family in two.

He said: 'When my sister-in-law split from her husband 18 years ago we did nothing but help her.'

Price,
of Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, was jailed for eight months after admitting
stealing £16,470, between January 2011 and April 2012.

Recorder Paul Hopkins QC told her: 'It is a tragedy that a woman of your age has come before the court for the first time.'

Price's sister Kenis, 52, said after the case: 'She would be responsible for paying everyone's salaries and keeping all the company accounts straight.

'It was important to have someone we could trust, someone reliable.

'We paid her a good salary and in one year she had four holidays - to Zante, Madeira, Ibiza and Gran Canaria. She even managed to send her 16-year-old son on a NASA trip to America.

'I used to admire her for managing her money so well.

'At the same time the business was struggling - we had to draw every single penny of our life savings out to pay everyone's salary.

'I never thought for a moment my own sister was stealing from us. I am completely heartbroken that my big sister who I loved so much could do what she did.'
