An elk who headbutted a photographer in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has been euthanized.  

Video footage of the incredible incident showed photographer James York sitting on the ground by the side of a road.

He acted submissively by keeping his head down but the elk became increasingly agitated, knocking of his hat and repeatedly jabbing him around the head and neck with its antlers.

It has now emerged that soon after the incident, the elk was put down by Rangers because he 'could not be re-trained to be fearful of humans.'

Mr York has said he is 'saddened and speechless'

'I love and respect animals and that’s why I photograph them and don’t hunt them. I am deeply hurt by the loss of such a beautiful creature that in its own way bonded with me. I looked forward to watching him grow to a mature bull as the years passed.

I’m truly heartbroken to know he is gone,' he wrote in a statement.

At the time of the incident, Mr York managed to remain calm, despite his predicament, and continued to act submissive, perhaps thinking the elk would lose interest and walk away.

Incredibly he even managed to take a few cheeky photographs of the animal as it hovered just inches away from his face.

The elk continued to stand its ground becoming more and more aggressive. At one point it menacingly begins rubbing its hoof on the ground looking as if it is about to charge.

According park spokeswoman Molly Schroer, the elk had been coming back to that area in search of food as a result of previous humans feeding him, and had begun associating humans with food.

Park Rangers assured Mr York that he did nothing wrong in the video.

The elk had been exhibiting aggressive behavior for a long time, and this was apparently their only course of action.

This isn’t something the park resorts to often and, in fact, this elk is the first the park has ever put down.

Mr York has said that he can no longer watch the video. 'All the joy is gone.'

He says he wished that the photos and video hadn't gone viral and that the elk might still be alive as a result.

The video was been posted on YouTube by Vince Camiolo who later emailed the photographer to get his side of the story.

At the time Mr York shared his thoughts. 'My first thoughts were 'wow, he's 
getting pretty damn close here.'

'But I've been up close before without 
incident. I hoped being still and passive would see him pass on.

When he
lowered his antlers to me, I wanted to keep my vitals protected and my 
head down. I felt that standing up would provoke him more and leave me 
more vulnerable to goring.'

I think that while protecting myself with my 
head down, having my head down was a signal that I was rutting with him.

I was concerned at first, but when he started rearing back and lunging 
at me later on, I got scared and pi**ed off.

'So I guess at some point if the Ranger hadn't of pulled up, I would have had to disengage the best I could. I've joked with my friends that at least he took me for a buck and not a cow!'
