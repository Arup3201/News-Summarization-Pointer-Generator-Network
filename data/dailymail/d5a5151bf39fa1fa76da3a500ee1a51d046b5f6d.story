Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone feels the sport needs to crank up the volume to improve the show.

But after hearing first hand the quieter noise of the new 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units - compared to the more visceral V8s - at a circuit for the first time this season, Ecclestone believes the sound levels are not as bad as many have criticised.

Australian Grand Prix chairman Ron Walker claimed Ecclestone was 'horrified' by the drop in decibels after watching the season-opening race a fortnight ago on television.

Making a noise: Bernie Ecclestone was in the paddock on Friday after missing the opening race of the season

Attending this weekend's race in Malaysia at the Sepang International Circuit, although the 83-year-old could hold a conversation in the pit lane, he was not unduly concerned.

'It's a little louder than we thought, so if we can just get it (the noise) up a little bit more then it would be all right,' said Ecclestone.

'It sounds terrible on TV, but the problem isn't that, it's about the people coming here and the whole atmosphere of Formula One.

'People said you couldn't hear anything, but it's not true. It just needs to be a bit louder than we have now.'

Issues: Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from the season-opening race in Australia following a fuel irregularity

In the fast lane: Red Bull experienced more issues with the fuel-flow sensors during practice for Sunday's race

Meanwhile, Red Bull experienced more issues with the contentious fuel-flow sensors during practice for the Malaysian Grand Prix, raising the prospect of another showdown with Formula One officials similar to the one that resulted in the team's disqualification in Australia. 

Daniel Ricciardo was excluded in Melbourne after finishing second, because race stewards said Red Bull exceeded the new fuel flow limit of 100 kilograms per hour. 

Red Bull blamed the issue on faulty readings from the FIA-approved fuel sensors and subsequently  appealed.

The sensors on Ricciardo's car malfunctioned again at Sepang, team principal Christian Horner said, showing a discrepancy with the team's own fuel-flow readings. 

Horner said he would talk with race director Charlie Whiting if the problem persisted on Saturday, in the hope of avoiding another post-race drama. 

'If we don't (get synchronised readings) we will find ourselves in an awkward situation, but one we will try to work with the FIA on, but we will find ourselves in the same dilemma as Melbourne,' Horner said.

We will have that conversation with Charlie and hopefully we can agree on something that is sensible.

'We need a better way of measuring and monitoring the fuel flow, or say you get rid of it and you have 100 kilograms for the race and that's it. Personally, I think it would be easier to get rid of it.'
