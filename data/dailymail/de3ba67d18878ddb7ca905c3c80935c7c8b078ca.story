‘I’d always ask people to repeat themselves. I felt like a stuck record,' said Jackie Hunt 

Jackie Hunt had struggled with her hearing for 15 years before she realised she had a genuine problem. 

‘Everything sounded muddy, as if through a door — but I assumed it was hay fever blocking my ears,’ says the 44-year-old administrator from Sutton Coldfield. 

However, over the years it gradually got worse. Jackie had to turn up the TV volume louder and louder, and could understand people only if she could see their mouths. 

‘I’d always ask people to repeat themselves. I felt like a stuck record,’ she says. 

But it was only when, in 2012, she saw an advert about hearing tests that she decided to take action. 

The results floored her. She had lost 60 per cent of her hearing and needed two hearing aids. The difference they made, is, she says, ‘amazing’. 

‘As I walked into our kitchen I asked what the ticking noise was — it was a huge clock that I’d never realised made a sound,’ says Jackie, who is married to Dave, 52, the director of a building company, and has two daughters, aged 23 and 20. 

‘I’d stopped working in a big office — now I have the confidence to do it again.

'And I use the train — previously, talking through a ticket office window was a no-no.’ 

More than ten million Britons — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss, yet many wait years before seeking help. 

There are two main types. Conductive hearing loss occurs when sounds cannot pass from the outer ear to the inner ear. 

Causes include a blockage, fluid build-up, or a problem with the small bones inside the ear that help you hear. 

Jackie has conductive loss, diagnosed by a specialist after she’d had a standard test at a branch of Hidden Hearing, a hearing aid chain. 

Hers is caused by otosclerosis — an abnormal, often genetic, growth of bone in  the middle ear, affecting 1 to 2 per cent of people. 

The second type is sensorineural hearing loss caused by damage to tiny hair cells inside the cochlea, the spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear, or to the auditory nerve. 

Hearing relies on sound waves entering the ear and causing the eardrum to vibrate. 

Jackie needed two hearing aids. The difference they made, is, she says, ‘amazing’

The vibrations are passed to the inner ear, where the hair cells move in response and send a signal through the auditory nerve to the brain. 

These hair cells can be damaged by injury or noise exposure, but it also happens naturally with age. 

More than half of people over 60 have some hearing loss, and campaigners are pushing for everyone over 65 to have their hearing screened on the NHS. 

But some experts say we should be having hearing tests even earlier. 

David McAlpine, professor of auditory neuroscience and director of the University College London Ear Institute, says: ‘We start losing our hearing as babies, but don’t notice it. 

'But by their mid-40s most people will have some hearing loss that affects their day-to-day life.’ 

Generally, we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies first. 

This can make deciphering speech difficult because consonants that help make words distinct are in the high frequencies, around 3-5kHz. 

Standard hearing tests, or audiograms — which measure your hearing by playing sounds at different volumes and pitches and ask you to respond by pressing a button — test up to 8kHz. 

Professor McAlpine would advise anyone over 45 to get their hearing checked — for example, at a High Street optician that offers a free hearing test — even if they don’t think they have a problem, as people don’t always realise what they should be able to hear. 

This is because not seeking help when you need it can make things worse: hearing loss cannot only cause social isolation and depression, but there are concerns that it could lead to cognitive problems. 

In 2011, U.S. researchers found older people with hearing loss are more likely to develop dementia, perhaps because a common brain pathway underlies both conditions. 

Another theory is the strain of trying to decode sounds can overwhelm the brain, leaving people more vulnerable to dementia. 

Research is continuing about whether hearing aids can reduce the risk. 

Studies suggest that for every 25 decibels of hearing loss (decibels relate to volume of sound — normal speech is around 60) a person experiences, they age cognitively by seven years — so a 59-year-old who has lost 25 decibels will perform like a 66-year-old in mental tasks. 

Professor McAlpine says: ‘Not hearing properly can add to what’s known as your cognitive load. 

‘I’d stopped working in a big office — now I have the confidence to do it again. And I use the train — previously, talking through a ticket office window was a no-no,' said Jackie

'The more cost you put to your brain while straining to hear someone speak, the fewer resources you have to do something else at the same time.’

And parts of the brain involved with hearing can start to shut down without enough input — so your hearing may get worse if you delay treatment. 

‘It can take three months for your brain to tune in to a hearing aid, especially if you’ve had the problem for a long time.’ 

He also warns that even top-ofthe- range versions have limitations. 

‘Hearing aids will help, rather than cor rect , your hear ing, ’ he says. 

‘So you should be given proper expectations of what they can do — they amplify sounds but won’t necessarily discriminate between them.’ 

But there’s another complicating factor to be aware of. 

According to Professor McAlpine, younger people’s hearing loss may occur for a different reason from older people’s — and it’s one that’s hard for specialists to detect.

‘We’ve identified a problem called “hidden hearing loss” — so called because it’s not picked up by traditional hearing tests,’ he says. 

More than ten million Britons — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss

While extremely loud noises — such as a chainsaw — can permanently kill off hair cells, it is thought that in hidden hearing loss, the damage affects the nerve cells in the cochlea. 

Rather than dying off, they lose their connections with the hair cells, so cannot send information to the brain. 

It’s possible the culprit need only be moderate noise, such as that of a busy street, although more research is needed into how much exposure would cause this. 

One type of nerve cell particularly affected is the kind that only responds to sounds above a certain volume. 

This means as this nerve cell is damaged, so is our ability to distinguish particular sounds against loud noises. 

Professor McAlpine adds: ‘An audiogram only measures your ability to hear distinct tones against a backdrop of silence. 

'So you may get a clean bill of health but still have hearing deficit.’ 

There are currently no accurate ways to diagnose this problem, and researchers are looking at whether hearing aids can even help. 

Ralph Home, head of biomedical research at the charity Action on Hearing Loss, says: ‘We know there are lots of people with good hearing who struggle to follow conversation in background noise, but it’s not yet clear if they all have hidden hearing loss or something else, such as problems with cognitive processing.’ 

What does seem clear is that many people with hearing loss delay seeking help — by an average of ten years, reckons the charity Ear Foundation. 

Reasons include not realising they have a problem to the social stigma surrounding hearing aids. 

It’s a stigma that Daniela Levy, 30, has grappled with. 

The health and fitness journalist, from Essex, shrugged off her poor hearing at first — but it became harder to ignore when it started affecting her work. 

‘In my 20s I started TV presenting, but couldn’t cope with the producers talking into my earpiece. 

'I stopped doing that type of presenting because I relied on lip-reading a lot.’ 

Daniela admits the only hearing test she’s had as an adult was when she was 24, at a High Street optician’s offering hearing tests.

‘They confirmed my hearing was well below what it should be and that I’d need a hearing aid. But I never went back.’ 

She adds: ‘When I meet someone new I joke about being deaf. But it’s embarrassing. 

'It’s deteriorated recently and I’m worried that when I’m 40 I won’t be able to hear at all.’
