Doctors no longer detect Ebola in a Texas nurse who flew to Ohio and back before she was diagnosed with the virus, her family said Wednesday.

Officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention couldn't detect Ebola in Amber Vinson as of Tuesday evening, her family said in a statement released through a media consultant. 

Doctors usually do two tests a day apart before saying they can't detect the virus. It's unclear how many tests Vinson has had.

Vinson's mother, Debra Berry, spoke to her Wednesday, and Vinson has been approved for transfer from isolation, the statement said.

'We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home,' Berry said.

Vinson, 29, remains in treatment at Emory, near Atlanta. Emory wouldn't release any information about the patient, hospital spokeswoman Holly Korschun said.

Unlike other American Ebola patients, like recently cured journalist Ashoka Mukpo, Vinson's caregivers do not appear to be releasing information about her course of treatment. 

Mukpo was given the experimental drug Brincidofovir and a transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly.

Brantly received another experimental drug, along with his fellow missionary worker Nancy Writebol, called ZMapp that may have helped to save them both.

Brantly also gave blood to help save Dr. Rick Sacra from the disease. Sacra was also given an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola.

Personnel in hazmat gear ended up removing over 50 barrels worth of material from Vinson's home to be destroyed

Authorities have not released the treatment regimen for Vinson's co-worker Nina Pham, who was in good condition Wednesday.

Along with Pham, Vinson helped care for a Liberian man with Ebola who died at a Dallas hospital. Another nurse there also became infected and is being treated outside Washington; her condition was upgraded from fair to good.

Health officials say Vinson visited the Akron area Oct. 10-13 to prepare for her wedding and was diagnosed once she returned to Dallas.

Officials are monitoring the health of 164 people in Ohio who are believed to have had contact with her or to have been near her.
