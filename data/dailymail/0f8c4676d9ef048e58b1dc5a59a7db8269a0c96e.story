Wanted: Convicted IRA terrorist Henry Fitzsimons is on the run after allegedly conspiring with the Italian mafia in a money laundering scheme

An IRA militant is on the run from Italian police after they cracked an alleged money laundering scheme linked to mafia gangs today.

A European arrest warrant has been issued for Henry James Fitzsimons, 63, a convicted terrorist from Belfast, after 20 alleged members of a criminal gang were arrested and assets worth £390million during the operation.

He is accused of conspiring with the 'Ndrangheta mafia to launder drug-trafficking money by investing in luxury properties along the Calabrian coast of southern Italy.

The IRA allegedly sent Fitzsimons to 
launder drug-trafficking profits with the help of the Italian mafia gang
'Ndrangheta, according to the news agency AGI.

Fitzsimons had invested around 12 
million Euros with the Italian mafia and a group of Spanish 
entrepreneurs to build resorts and luxury residences on some of the most
beautiful, undeveloped beaches of Calabria, police said.

After serving eight years for 
terrorism, Fitzsimons had reinvented himself as an entrepreneur. His 
role was to promote the properties in Britain and Ireland and advise  
potential customers. 

The money he invested in the 
construction of a resort called  ‘Gioiello del Mare ‘ or Jewel of the 
Sea, in Brancaleone, on the southern tip of Italy was certainly of 
criminal origin, according to detectives.

Veteran mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri is leading the investigation into the 'Ndrangheta gang

His membership of the IRA was ascertained by wiretapped phone conversations, the arrest warrant said.

The Irish separatist group allegedly first contacted the 'Ndrangheta mafia branch, based in Calabria, as far back as 2007.

The IRA has previously been known to launder money through organised criminal gangs in Spain.

Colonel Claudio Pettrozziello said: 'We know from the terminology he used that the money originated from crime.

'We can't prove it was IRA money but we know he still had strong links to the organisation.

'We are still hoping to catch 
Fitzsimons. We have issued the warrant for his arrest but he has already
fled Europe, beyond our jurisdiction.' he said.

He added: 'He knew he was involved with the mafia and we believe he himself had reason to fear for his life.'

The 'Ndrangheta, whose name means 'virtue' in a dialect of ancient Greek, originally made their money from kidnappings and extortion.

But they have now expanded into the drugs and property from which their huge profits are invested in northern Europe.

Police seized 12 companies and 17 tourist complexes in Calabria where the 'Ndrangheta had allegedly invested illicit money.

The investigation was led by veteran anti-Mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri who says the ‘Ndrangheta has evolved into an extensive business network reinvesting the profits from narcotics, arms trafficking and other sources estimated at ten of billions of euros a year.

'This is a new ‘Ndrangheta entrepreneurship, a new way of ‘doing Mafia’ where there is no shooting or killing, but where affiliation derives only from one matrix: money,' the finance police statement said according to the Financial Times.
