 

A charity endorsed by celebrities including Jerry Hall and Jerome Flynn was last night accused of promoting a Vitamin C therapy which falsely claims to ‘kill cancer’.

Doctors listed on the Yes To Life (YTL) website charge patients – many of whom are dying – up to £3,000 to administer high doses of intravenous Vitamin C, despite it being clinically unproven against any form of cancer.

Yet a description on the website makes it sound like a virtual panacea, suggesting it can be used against all kinds of conditions.

Medical experts last night described the claims as ‘quackery’ and called for the Charity Commission to investigate. 

One has already reported YTL to the Advertising Standards Authority.

Until last week, YTL’s website carried a glowing endorsement from actress Maureen Lipman, but when it was drawn to her attention by The Mail on Sunday she said she had no memory of the words ascribed to her.

‘I looked at their website and I got the idea they were saying, “This cures cancer”,’ she said, ‘so I asked them to remove it, which they did.’

Last night, leading cancer consultant Agamemnon Epenetos described the YTL claims as ‘inaccurate’ and ‘false’. He said: ‘There is no evidence at all. Major studies have been done and have shown that there is no evidence that it works in cancer.’

YTL describes itself as a charity which supports people with cancer by ‘combining the best of complementary and alternative medicine with standard treatments’. On the website, model Hall says: ‘I wish Yes To Life great success in its wonderful work’, while Game of Thrones star Flynn declares: ‘It was an easy decision to get involved and spearhead the initial campaign for Yes To Life.’

Elsewhere on the site, claims are made for Vitamin C therapy, saying it can ‘destroy cancer cells in a non-toxic way when used in very large doses’, that ‘Vitamin C acts in the following manner to kill cancer’ and that it ‘enhances the production of collagen, which will encircle the cancer and prevent its expansion’. 

It also claims Vitamin C therapy ‘can be used in any stage of cancer’.

Experts say the claims – accompanied by a list of doctors offering the therapy at more than £3,000 – could be in breach of The Cancer Act, which outlaws the promotion of false claims to cure cancer.

Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor of Complementary Medicine at Exeter University, said: ‘Few things in health care are more despicable than the exploitation of vulnerable and often desperate cancer patients. 

'There is no good evidence that Vitamin C injections are effective for any type of cancer.’

Among those on YTL’s website offering the therapy is Dr Michael Wetzler, of Hill Medical Centre in North London. He appeared before the General Medical Council (GMC) in 2004 for giving a baby the wrong vaccine. When approached by The Mail on Sunday, he told us: ‘I shall give your email my attention next week.’

Another doctor offering the procedure appeared before the GMC only last month. Dr Julian Kenyon, medical director of the Dove Clinic in Hampshire, still faces a fitness to practise hearing in December after he misled patients over cancer treatment involving soundwave and light beds. He did not comment when The Mail on Sunday contacted him.

In 2011, The Charity Commission found it acceptable for YTL to provide links to treatments after receiving a complaint they were medically unproven. YTL founder Robin Daly said: ‘The only thing we do is to provide interested people with information.’

The Mail on Sunday contacted agents for Ms Hall and Mr Flynn, but neither replied.
