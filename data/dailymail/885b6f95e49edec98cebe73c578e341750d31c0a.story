It wasn’t quite serious enough to warrant calling the Flying Squad.

But when faced with a middle-aged man refusing to get out of the pool at a leisure centre, one over-eager police force did deem it appropriate to send in the ‘Swimming Squad’.

As many as eight officers and four police cars were dispatched to the scene, before two policemen jumped into the water in full uniform to subdue the man.

Extreme measures: Two fully clothed policemen waded into a swimming pool in Bournemouth, Dorset, to remove a man in his 50s who refused to leave

Disturbance: The man in his 50s had been causing a minor nuisance - shouting at children who splashed him

They restrained the swimmer, thought to be in his 50s, and used a children’s flotation device to drag him towards the side where several uniformed colleagues were waiting.

The man was then hauled out of the  water, placed in handcuffs and led out of the pool area.

Despite the dramatic police response, the swimmer was found to have committed no offence and was driven home by officers.

Witnesses said the trouble at the pool in Bournemouth, Dorset, began when the man began shouting and swearing at children who had been splashing him in the water.

Lifeguards asked him to leave but when he refused, police were called to help.

Sharese Taylor, who was in the spectator area of the pool after having a swim, filmed the incident on her mobile phone.

The 19-year-old sales assistant said the man had reacted angrily towards the children but claimed the police’s handling of the situation was ‘ridiculous’.

Detained: The police officers got the man to the side of the pool where at least four uniformed colleagues were waiting

'Over the top: Officers then bound his feet together and placed him in hand-cuffs

She said: ‘I had been in the pool and noticed a guy at the side who was leaning on his forearm and he appeared to be asleep.

‘I got out to get changed and  suddenly I heard shouting.

‘I went into the viewing area and the guy must have been splashed by a boy because he started shouting, “Get out of my way!” and swearing.

‘The lifeguard asked him to leave but he refused to.

Suddenly eight police officers arrived in the pool area and two jumped in fully clothed, from different sides.

‘They used a long, red “noodle float” [a long, bendy foam cylinder] to pull him over to the side.

It took about four policemen to hold him down and they used some kind of straps to tie his feet together. They then handcuffed him.

‘It was ridiculous that so many police turned up and that two of them went into the water.

It seemed a bit over the top.’

She said that she saw four police cars outside the building.

Dorset Police refused to confirm how many officers attended the incident at the Littledown leisure centre at teatime on Tuesday.

Released: After seizing the swimmer at the Littledown centre, police found the man hadn't committed a crime and officers drove him home

Incident: Police said the officers were dealing with a potential breach of the peace in a 'high risk environment'

But Chief Inspector Chris Weeks said the officers had dealt with a potential breach of the peace in a ‘high-risk environment’.

He said: ‘Dorset Police responded to a report of an aggressive male shouting and swearing in a public place.

‘There were concerns for members of the public as this incident was taking place in a public swimming pool.

The officers in attendance were faced with a potentially high-risk environment to work in where positive action was essential to prevent a breach of the peace.’

Colette Kiernander, the general manager at the Littledown centre, said: ‘There was an incident, which is currently being reviewed.

Employees monitored the situation closely at all times in accordance with our procedures and I’d like to thank them and the authorities for their assistance.’
