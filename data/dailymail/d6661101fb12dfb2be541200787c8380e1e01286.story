Angry: Freddie Starr has blasted police and the CPS for 'tarring me with the same brush' as Jimmy Savile

Freddie Starr has pledged to bring Operation Yewtree 'down on its knees' after his fourth arrest over historical sex abuse allegations.

The TV comic, 71, blasted Scotland Yard for using him as a scapegoat after failing to convict Jimmy Savile during his lifetime.

The investigation, which was set up in October 2012, has so far led to 16 arrests, with four people charged and five suspects remaining on bail.

Mr Starr, who denies the claims, was first arrested in November 2012 in connection with the late DJ, and three more times over unrelated allegations.

Last year he suffered a health scare due to stress.

Mr Starr told The Daily Mirror: 'I've been tarred with the same brush as Savile and Gary Glitter. What's happened to me is unlawful. The cops and the Crown Prosecution Service are playing dirty.

'I will expose them and bring Operation Yewtree down on its knees.'

He added: 'It's a celebrity witch-hunt after the Met failed to get the one person who was guilty, Savile. If they had enough evidence they would have charged me.'

He was arrested on Wednesday after returning to the police station to answer bail. He has been re-bailed until April.

His lawyer says he will now file for a judicial review into the conduct of the police and CPS.

Dean Dunham said:
 'In January 2014 we wrote to the police and Crown Prosecution Service 
to express concern for the amount of time that the investigation was 
taking and to put them on notice that we believed that the decision to 
keep Mr Starr on bail was unlawful.

Accusation: Mr Starr claims police are trying to make arrests to atone for the Jimmy Savile scandal in 2012

Senior officers and prosecutors faced allegations of a 'celebrity witch hunt' to 'make us feel better about Savile' after former BBC DJ Dave Lee Travis was this week acquitted on 12 of 14 sex assault charges

Coronation Street actor William Roache was also cleared of sex charges, not in connection with Operation Yewtree. The acquittals have sparked questions into police conduct

'Both the police and CPS responded by saying that a decision whether to charge or release would be forthcoming by 12 February 2014, at the latest.

'We are therefore disappointed that this has not transpired and as such Mr Starr will now be filing an application in the High Court for judicial review in relation to the conduct of the police and CPS.'

Senior officers and prosecutors also faced allegations of a ‘celebrity witch hunt’ to ‘make us feel better about Savile’ after the former BBC superstar DJ Dave Lee Travis was acquitted on 12 of 14 sex assault charges.

The acquittal of the former Radio 1 star – dubbed  the ‘Hairy Cornflake’ – came the week after Coronation Street actor William Roache was cleared of sex charges dating back to the 1960s and follows last year’s failed prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel.

However, MailOnline understands that there is no review planned into the Scotland Yard investigation at this stage.

Scotland Yard did not name the performer, but released a statement that said: 'Today 'Yewtree 2' was further arrested after returning to a police station to answer bail.

'The arrest relates to further allegations made to Operation Yewtree, which falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'. We are not prepared to discuss further.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
