The Victoria's Secret show wouldn't have been complete without model of the moment Cara Delevingne yesterday.

But slim Cara has revealed she didn't stress too much about pre-show preparations to perfect her model figure.

Instead of a hardcore gym session and lemon cleanse, the 5ft 9" model, 21, chowed down on a feast of greasy Domino's takeaway and indulged in a computer game marathon.

Cara Delevingne wowed on the Victoria's Secret runway on Wednesday but admitted she hadn't exactly been hitting the gym to prepare

Cara and Journdan Dunn starred as part of the British Invasion segment, along with Lily Donaldson and Taylor Swift in a Union Jack costume.

Cara showed off her incredible legs as 
she sashayed along the runway in a silk pantsuit holding an English 
football with the Victoria's Secret logo across it.

Backstage, they spoke to Grazia Daily about their preparations, and divulged a surprising regime.

'Ummâ€¦I went to Juice Press yesterday and
had a juice, but really I haven't done much to prepare,' said Cara, who
admits she gets nervous before a show.

'I actually found out quite late that I was doing the show because of my filming schedule.

'The new Call of Duty came out so I've 
been playing that like crazy and eating Dominos pizza. And Dominos 
chicken strippers, all 21 of them.'

Jourdan meanwhile confessed she actually had laser hair removal and a swanky oxygen facial. She said the biggest challenge on a Victoria's Secret show day is being sexy all day.

'Really, you can't turn it off, my cheeks are so sore from all the smiling,' she said.

Though Cara looked sensational on the runway, proving her model credentials for the umpteenth time, the supermodel has shifted career focus to acting.

After smaller acting parts in Anna Karenina and Kids In Love, she was recently in Italy to prepare for her biggest role to date.

Cara will play young English woman Melanie in new film The Face of An Angel, in which she will star alongside Rush star Daniel Bruhl and Total Recall actress Kate Beckinsale.
