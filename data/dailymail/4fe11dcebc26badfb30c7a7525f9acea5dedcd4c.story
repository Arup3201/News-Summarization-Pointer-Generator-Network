It's believed Zahra, 18, is training to become a dingo handler

A Queensland dingo sanctuary has found the most unlikely of advocates to help raise much needed funds so it can continue to run.

Zahra Chamberlain, the half-sister of Azaria Chamberlain – the nine-week-old baby snatched from her tent at Uluru in 1980 by a dingo, is heading a campaign to continue the conservation and protection of dingoes in Queensland.

It's believed the 18 year old is also learning to be a dingo handler.

The Sunday Telegraph has reported the Year 12 student, from Lake Macquarie, NSW, has been flying to Queensland to support the Durong dingo sanctuary and raise awareness.

While Zahra was never part of the family tragedy, which occurred long before she was born, it has made a big mark on her life.

Her father Michael Chamberlain and his then wife, Lindy, were embroiled in a long battle regarding the death of their daughter, Azaria Chamberlain.

They had reported that their daughter had been taken from their tent by a dingo on the night of August 17, 1980, on a family camping trip to Uluru.

However Lindy Chamberlain was tried for Azaria's murder and spent more than three years in prison, while Michael was convicted as an accessory after the fact and received a suspended sentence.

Zahra Chamberlain is learning how to become a dingo trainer. The 18 year old is the half-sister of Azaria Chamberlain – the nine-week-old baby snatched from her tent at Uluru in 1980 by a dingo. Her dad Michael Chamberlain and his then wife Lindy fought for 32 years to have their name cleared to prove a dingo was responsible for the death of their baby daughter, Azaria

She was released when a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair, and new inquests were opened.

In 2012, some 32 years after Azaria's death, the Chamberlains' version of events were officially confirmed by a coroner. 

In an interview with The Sunday Mail, Zahra said she wanted to use her profile to educate people about the maligned canine.

'We’re past all that terrible negative history,' she said. 'Given my family’s past, I still love dingoes as I do any other Australian wildlife.' 

In 1991 Lindy and Michael Chamberlain divorced and three years later Mr Chamberlain remarried Ingrid Bergner to have Zahra in 1996.

While Zahra never knew her half sister, the Daily Telegraph reported she was by her dad’s side in 2012 when one of the most controversial cases in Australian history ended, finding a dingo had in fact killed her sister Azaria.

But the emotional milestone didn't keep her away from and loving the animal that caused her family so much pain.

Zahra has set up a gofundme website to help raise funds for the Durong Dingo Sanctuary in Queensland because she says owner, Simon Stretton, is on a Disability Pension and can't afford to pay for ongoing costs to continue conserving and protecting the dingoes.

Zahra said 'Biosecurity has issues regarding the number of dingoes he owns and their housing arrangements. They want him to either de-sex them, separate the sexes, or take some dingoes away and send them another zoo.'

'To solve this problem, he needs to build 5 new enclosures very quickly. We are looking at roughly $8000 plus just for materials.'

So far the site has raised over $2000 and is slowly gaining more media attention.

Despite his history with dingoes, Zahra says her father Michael has become supportive of her passion to help them.  

Earlier this year, one of the dingoes at the Durong sanctuary unexpectedly gave birth to four pups and it's believed the fourth pup was named after Zahra.
