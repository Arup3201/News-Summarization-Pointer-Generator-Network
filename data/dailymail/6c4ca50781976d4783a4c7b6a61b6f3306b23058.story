Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall insists he still believes the club can secure promotion this season - despite his disastrous dug-out debut.

Ally McCoist's number two took charge of the side for the first time since the manager was placed on garden leave last Saturday at Easter Road.

But it was a nightmare afternoon for the former Partick and St Mirren striker as Hibernian hammered his hapless team 4-0.

Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowell believes they can still achieve promotion this season

The defeat allowed Hearts to extend their massive lead to 15 points at the top of the Scottish Championship, while Alan Stubbs' Leith side have closed to within four of the second-placed Gers.

With confidence at an all-time low on the pitch and a cash crisis brewing off it, Rangers are far from guaranteed to make it back to the Premiership at the first attempt.

But McDowall insists that is still the target, regardless of the problems facing the Glasgow giants.

Asked if he believes promotion is still achievable, the interim boss said: 'Absolutely. That's the way you have to be here. We are expected to win games, to win leagues, to win cups - nothing changes in that aspect.

'The players know that and know what they have to do, so we carry on regardless.

'I'm not looking above us to Hearts or over my shoulder to Hibs. All I'm looking at is Dumbarton on Saturday. It's one game at a time, I've said that all along.'

McDowell's first game in charge saw the Ibrox club thrashed 4-0 at Hibernian on December 27

McDowall will boss the team at Ibrox for the first time on Saturday when Dumbarton visit and the 51-year-old hopes to get 2015 off to a better start than the previous year ended with a winning display.

'First of all we have got to get back working hard,' he said. 'We appreciate it was a poor performance against Hibs. The lads were disappointed with themselves.

'We sat through the video and looked at the game. Everyone took their share of the blame. We have to do better. It's as simple as that. But we just don't become a bad team over night.

'We just need to get back to winning ways come Saturday.

'It's always great to play at Ibrox, so that will be a good thing. But it will be a tough game against Dumbarton. We will have to be patient and make sure we get a result.'
