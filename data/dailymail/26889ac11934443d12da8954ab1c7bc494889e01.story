Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla wants to keep his place at the heart of the Gunners midfield after his recent purple patch of form, despite the return of club record signing Mesut Ozil to the squad.

The 30-year-old has scored four goals and assisted twice since being deployed in a central role from the beginning of December.

His fine festive form earned the Spaniard the Premier League Player of the Month award in December, as he believes he can make more of an impact in the middle of the park and is optimistic he can keep up his recent form.

The 30-year-old, in action against stoke at the weekend, has flourished playing centrally for Arsenal 

'I have more space [in the middle], more possibilities to score and assist, and I like this position very much,' he told Arsenal.com. 'I always can help the team and I love when I play in the middle.'

Cazorla has made 30 appearances for the Gunners this season and hopes his current form can hold down a central spot in midfield having created 47 chances for his team-mates, a stat only bettered by Alexis Sanchez, but will have increased competition with the return of Ozil from a knee injury. 

'I want to continue to play at this level for the rest of the season. I always want to help the team with goals,' added Cazorla.

'I hope to score more until the end of the season. It's very important for me and the team.'
