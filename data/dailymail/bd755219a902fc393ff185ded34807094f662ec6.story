Actress Mariel Hemingway shuns Botox, fillers and facelifts, and chooses to age naturally.

The 53-year-old, best known for her portrayal of Woody Allen's teenage lover Tracy in the film Manhattan, shopped makeup free at Erewhon in Calabasas for fresh fruits. Unlike most actresses who fight the ravages of time with the help of more and more surgery, the yoga enthusiast says she uses pumpkin peels and clay masks at night. 

Getting older in Hollywood is 'hard as hell,' she told People magazine in 2009.

Life's the berries: Actress Mariel Hemingway shuns Botox, fillers and facelifts, and chooses to age naturally. She likes her fruit natural too.

 She also admitted to trying Botox, fillers and plumpers but not liking them.

Hemingway began her film career at the tender age of 14 in Lipstick in 1976. The film wasn’t considered particularly good but audiences noticed the young Hemingway girl and so did Woody Allen.

Two years later, Mariel played a high school student in Manhattan for which she picked up an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Her fresh faced good looks and blonde hair made her a 1980s' sex kitten.

In 1983, she acted in the film, Playmate of the Year the story of Dorothy Stratten, a Playboy Playmate in 1979, who died tragically in 1980.

For the film role, Mariel opted for a breast augmentation that she later replaced with smaller saline implants. The implants ruptured sending silicone into her blood that took a long time and a lengthy process to get out of her system. She admitted to using Botox injections to reduce facial lines but went public saying they made her face feel ‘all wrong..I felt bloated’.

The complications of the breast augmentation put her off on any further extensive cosmetic surgery and made her willing to live with somewhat shocking facial age lines in an industry obsessed with youth.

The granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway - who defined American fiction in the 20th century - her family history has been plagued by tragedy.

Her famous family was haunted by depression, alcoholism, mental illness and five suicides over four generations.

Mariel was born in 1961 only a few months after her grandfather Ernest pulled the trigger on a double-barrelled shotgun he had pressed against his forehead and blew his brains out.

The idealized life that the writer was selling to the world was a coverup for the truth of his self-dramatisation and a chronic self-identity crisis, his alcoholism, and his attraction to war.

His life started to fall apart when he learned his own father had shot himself in the head with a Civil War revolver.

Family suicides didn’t end there.

Mariel’s old sister, Margaux a very troubled and beautiful fashion model and actress, shockingly committed suicide in 1996.

Margaux and another old sister, Joan had both been sexually abused by their father Jack, Ernest’s son.

Somehow, Mariel escaped the sexual transgression.

Her own family was riddled with alcoholism and arguing.

Her younger sister, Muffet, a heavy drug used in her teens, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent years in mental hospitals.

Now desperate to escape the cycles of severe mental health issues that have plagued the Hemingways, Mariel has remained strong and committed to a healthy life – and learning how to overcome the family demons.

But at a cost of the typical Hollywood root of extensive facial plastic surgery.
