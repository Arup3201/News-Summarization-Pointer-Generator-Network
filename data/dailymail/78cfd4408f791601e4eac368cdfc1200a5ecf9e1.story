After a bitter start, Monday ended pretty sweetly for Sugar the puppy.

The adorable Pomeranian was rescued from a drain pipe in Davie, Florida after he fell 3 feet underground in the front yard of his home.

Little Sugar, who is just two-months old, got stuck in the pipe, which is connected to the sewer system, and spent a few tense hours down there as rescuers worked tirelessly to get him out.

His owner, Simone Walker, was worried sick.

'I'm praying, I'm hoping they can get him out,' she told NBC Miami at one point.

Walker and her family first noticed Sugar had fallen into the pipe when they heard the frightened pup whining.

They tried to get him out themselves but couldn't so called for help.

Davie Fire Rescue and Davie Police responded to the scene.

Firefighters, more used to rescuing cats from trees than dogs from drain pipes, dug a hole in the lawn to get to Sugar.

But they kept running into obstacles, including cables, wires and tree roots.

So they called for backup and in stepped utility workers from the city of Sunrise armed with a special camera designed for exploring sewer pipes.

'They were in the area and very generous to really just jump in right away and have their resources at our disposal,' Davie Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Jorge Gonzalez told NBC.

In all, 20 firefighters and utility workers helped rescue Sugar from the pipe.

Happy: Wet and bedraggled, Sugar was thrilled to be free after the hours-long ordeal

And finally, after several hours underground, the pup was pulled out at 6:14 p.m. during a live TV news report.

'It's a great feeling. It's not always the sick and injured and sometimes bad outcomes,' Gonzalez said of the rescue.

'Here's a great opportunity and a great example to have a fantastic outcome from something as small as a little dog.'

After emerging wet and shivering, Sugar was back to his old, fluffy self after a bath.
