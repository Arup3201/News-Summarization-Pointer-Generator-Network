Do you have trouble dropping off at night? The solution may have arrived.

Designer Joe Manus has created a revolutionary piece of furniture: a rocking bed, encased in a circular frame, to lull you gently to sleep.

Joe wanted the bed's motion to mimic a baby being rocked to sleep. He says he wanted to create a space where you could: 'Dream your dreams, love your lover, and rest your soul.'

Rock-a-bye baby: Joe Manus built the Rocking Bed, designed to help people drift off to sleep

Built for indoor slumber or stargazing outside, the Rocking Bed comes with a rubber stop that allows you to lock the bed in place or let it move freely. We'd advise using it on hilly terrain.

The design can even be tweaked to fit your taste: the carbon steel frame can be blackened, brushed or even be replaced with wood and is available in twin, full, king and queen sizes.

But a peaceful night's sleep doesn't come cheap: this quirky piece of furniture, available on Shinerinternational.com, will set you back £1980.95.

Those who sleep for six to seven hours per night have a longer life expectancy than those who slumber for eight hours.Randy Gardner, 17, set the world record going the longest time without sleep in 1964, when he stayed awake for 264 hours and 12 minutes.The average person wakes up about six times each night.12 per cent of people have black and white dreams. Before color television though, the number was 75 per cent.If it takes you less than five minutes to fall asleep then you are probably sleep deprived. The ideal amount of time is about 10 minutes.
