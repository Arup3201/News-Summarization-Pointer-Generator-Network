The presenter was suddenly hit with a wall of snow, which completely engulfed him.

But, despite the slamming, he did not falter in his broadcast and just kept on speaking.

It was a far cry from the reaction in the studio, with anchors Sheneille Jones and Chris Murphy screaming out, worried about his safety.

Later in the show, Keeley made light of the incident.

'You know, I've spent my whole time here, ever since the invention of YouTube, I have done everything I could to avoid being a YouTube star, and I think that hit will be on YouTube,' he said.

He also joked that a reporter from a rival TV station was driving the plow.
