It seems nothing will keep the Jenner sisters away from a good party - not even their father being involved in a serious car crash.

Kendall and Kylie were seen living it up alongside Kanye West, Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez on Saturday night at a Big Sean concert in West Hollywood.

Meanwhile dad Bruce was at the center of an investigation into a car crash that left a woman dead in Malibu earlier in the day.

The socialite sisters showed up at the House Of Blues in West Hollywood for the star studded gig hours after the horror smash on the Pacific Coast Highway.

A 69-year-old named locally as Kim Howe, a neighbor of the Kardashian family, died when Bruce's car shunted into her vehicle at a traffic light, forcing her into the path of an oncoming ttraffic

Detectives on Sunday were still trying to discover what caused the accident but Bruce - who was uninjured - is understood to have passed a sobriety test.

As news of the crash broke, worried Kendall dashed to be with big sister Khloe Kardashian at her home in Calabasas.

But later that evening, she teamed up with her 17-year-old sister and brother-in-law Kanye to support Big Sean.

Earlier in the day Kanye was pictured arriving at the RocNation brunch with wife Kim Kardashian but she was presumed to have stayed at home that night.

A photograph of Kendall wearing a Guns & Roses T shirt in a group shot with Bieber, J-Lo, Chris Brown and Kanye emerged on the I Luh Ya Papi singer's Instagram account.

J-Lo captioned it:  'After the show... This happened #houseofblues #bigSean.'

Demi Lovato was also at the must-be-seen-at gig and posted a photo of herself with J-LO to Instagram. 

According to inquisitr.com at one point during the show, Bieber took to the stage to hug Big Sean. 

The two stars go way back with the Dark Side Paradise rapper featuring on the Canadian's 2012 album Believe and on the single As Long As You Love Me. 

At the end of the night, Kylie was pictured leaving with her rumored boyfriend Tyga, 25, in the back of a green Rolls Royce. The pair have been rumored to have been dating since October. 

On Sunday it was back to business as usual for the teenager as she posted her latest sultry selfie which showed she had ditched the dreadlocks she had been wearing since a fashion shoot last week.

Kim Kardashian-West has, in the past, likened herself to Cleopatra. And here, it seems, she is channeling the character once again with a very modern take on the look. This red cross-over crop top and pleated maxi skirt, both custom made by Balmain, look amazing on her.

For now though, we'll concentrate on the maxi skirt. It's much too early in the year to talk about crop tops, in the UK anyway!

So as we know, through Kim's social media channels, she is into waist training - meaning she wears a corset-type of contraption to make her waist permanently tiny - and here, in this skirt, she's showing off the results.

Look at that stomach!

Apart from the perfect fit, the standout red on Kim is a great colour, and the maxi length of the skirt makes her look taller than her five foot two inches. We also love the gold rope jewellery, by another of Kim's favourite labels, Lanvin.

Kim and Balmain are a great fit. Literally.

To re-create Kim's look, why not try the American Apparel red pleated skirt below, now reduced to $31!
