Richard Sharp, one of the former bankers hand-picked for a job with the new financial watchdog, donated more than £400,000 to the Tory party

A former banker hand-picked by chancellor George Osborne to help police the financial system donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party.

Richard Sharp, a 23 year veteran of Goldman Sachs, donated £402,420 in the decade before the Conservatives returned to power in May 2010, according to official records.

He was appointed in March to the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, the new watchdog set up to protect the public from another financial meltdown.

Last night Sharp’s role on the committee was slammed as ‘wholly inappropriate’.

One insider said the donations are likely to be scrutinised by the influential Treasury Select Committee of MPs, which will grill new committee members over the next few weeks.

‘The parameters against which these appointments are judged are independence and competence. So it’s likely this issue will be raised.’

There are no rules banning members from making political donations.

But in legislation published by the Treasury in January last year it said that the FPC may need to make unpopular decisions.

It added that ‘it is vital that such decisions can be taken independently of undue political influence.’

The Bank of England’s code of conduct also stipulates that members must demonstrate they have no financial or other interests ‘that could give rise to a perception that the individual concerned could not be wholly independent, disinterested and impartial as a member of the committee.’

According to official records, Sharp has made no donations to the Conservative Party since 2010.

But John Mann, Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘It’s wholly inappropriate for anyone giving a donation to any political party, particularly the party in power, to sit on that committee.’

Mr Sharp was one of the longest serving partners at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs - nicknamed Golden Sacks because of its lavish pay packages. He resigned at the end of 2006.

The 56 year old was one of four people outside the Bank  to be hand picked by Osborne to join the FPC, which is headed by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King. Sharp receives a £55,000 salary for the part time job.

Others appointed included Dame Clara Furse, the former boss of the London Stock Exchange.

Welcoming the appointments Osborne in March he said: ‘The calibre and expertise of these four individuals shows we have also got the brightest and the best working on that committee.’

The FPC wields considerable power and has been charged with  spotting risks in the financial system to prevent future crises.

It has ordered banks to raise an extra £25 billion to plug a giant shortfall in their capital buffers designed to cushion themselves against future financial shocks.

Despite his long stint at Goldman Sachs, Sharp has been critical of bankers’ failings. 

In April he appeared in a fiery debate on banking on Channel 4’s comedy and current affairs programme 10 O’ Clock Live.

Asked whether the financial system was safe, he said; ‘Hopefully not – there would be a big problem if bankers felt they could run their banks and not feel the consequences of bad decisions.’

The Treasury and the Bank of England refused to comment on the appointment. 

But insiders said the government appointed a recruitment firm and advertised for the roles. Sharp was interviewed by senior Treasury officials, including cross-bencher Baroness Hogg.
