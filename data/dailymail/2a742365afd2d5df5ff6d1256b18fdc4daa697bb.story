Engineers have launched an underwater contraption which enables watergoers to 'swim like a dolphin' - similar to the jet used in the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball.

The cutting-edge watercraft, called Seabob F7, uses a revolutionary electric jet that generates 700 newtons of thrust, propelling users along under the waves at speeds of up to 9mph (15km/h).

The jet system is the first in the world to feature an impeller - a special kind of rotor - powered by an electric motor, which sucks in water then fires it out the back of the craft.

The Seabob F7, pictured, can dive to more than 130ft, operate for an hour, and the craft's speed is controlled by hand controls to flick through its 10 gears. The craft is steered using the driver's bodyweight to angle the craft

Performance: 5.2kW

Maximum thrust: 734 N

Speed over water: Up to 13mph (22 km/h)

Speed under water: Up to 9mph (15 km/h)

Average operating time:  60 minutes

Diving depth: Up to 131ft (40m)

Dimensions: 51" x 18.9" x 15"

Weight: 64kg

Bouyancy in water: 8kg

Colours: Red, orange, yellow, blue, silver, white, titanium and chrome

It can dive to more than 130ft - the maximum depth for recreational divers - and can operate for an hour.

The craft's speed is controlled by hand controls that flick through its 10 gears.

It is steered using the driver's bodyweight to angle the craft, while an onboard computer informs users of power usage, depth, water temperature and speed.

The basic model starts at £12,500 ($20,700) but buyers can spend almost double for a top of the range one that comes with a special charger and case.

The futuristic machine is the brainchild of Cayogo based in Stuttgart, Germany.

Its website describes the Seabob F7 as the 'absolute epitome of strength, technological intelligence and perfect function'.

'Relaxed gliding, sporty driving or diving safely under water - it's all possible with a Seabob.

'It's now actually possible to move through the water like a dolphin, either on the surface or at depth.'

The electric jetstream system in the Seabob F7, pictured, has been patented and uses an electro-motor with a protected running impeller in a jet channel. It works on the principle of water displacement. Water is sucked in by the powerful rotating impeller and forced out in the jet channel under high pressure

Above water, the Seabob F7 can reach speeds of up to 13mph (22 km/h), and up to 9mph (15 km/h) under water. It weighs 64kg and has a 8kg buoyancy in the water. It is available in red, orange, yellow, pictured, blue, silver, white, titanium and chrome

The Seabob F7 is similar to the underwater jet seen in the 1965 James Bond film, Thunderball, pictured, starring Sean Connery

'The Seabob offers all-round high-performance. This is because its hydrodynamic shape gives it unexpected agility in the water.

'Steering and diving couldn't be easier - it's all done by shifting your body weight. Apply only light pressure and the Seabob will obligingly begin to dive, man and machine forging ahead with power and purpose.

The electric jetstream system has been patented and uses an electro-motor with a protected running impeller in a jet channel.

The basic model of the Seabob F7 from Cayago, pictured, starts at £12,500 ($20,700) but buyers can spend almost double for a top of the range one that comes with a special charger and case

German makers Cayago also sell a Seabob F5 S version of its jet, pictured, which is 35kg, reaches speeds of up to 12mph (20km/h) above water and has a force of 680 newtons. This smaller model costs £6,500 ($10,805)

It works on the 
principle of water displacement where water is sucked in by the powerful 
rotating impeller and forced out in the jet channel under high 
pressure.

'This special patent means that its electric jetstream system is unique when it comes to drive systems for high-performance water vehicles,' continued Cayogo.

Above water, the Seabob F7 can reach speeds of up to 13mph (22 km/h), and up to 9mph (15 km/h) under water.

It weighs 141lb (64kg) and has a 17lb (8kg) buoyancy in the water. It is available in red, orange, yellow, blue, silver, white, titanium and chrome.

Cayago said: 'Steering and diving couldn't be easier - it's all done by shifting your body weight. Apply only light pressure and the Seabob will obligingly begin to dive, man and machine forging ahead with power and purpose'

James Bond films have a history of underwater vehicles, including the Lotus Esprit, pictured, featured in 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me
