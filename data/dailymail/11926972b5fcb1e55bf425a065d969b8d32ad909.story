It's constantly raining cats and dogs in Britain.

But now even pets will be happy to brave the wet weather with this innovative dog lead with built-in umbrella which protects your pooch.

Created by Puppia, a leading dog fashion brand, it works just like a human brolly, but features a leash attachment meaning owners don't need to carry a separate lead. 

The leash fastens on to a dog's harness and the umbrella is complete with a clear plastic cover to help your pet avoid any puddles.

Puppia's Dog Umbrella is priced £24 and has a handy  leash attachment that fasten onto a dog's harness

Melody Lewis, director at PetLondon who distribute Puppia products, said: 'Small dogs especially don't like to get wet and owners can find it difficult to get them out and about when it's raining.

'The umbrella helps them enjoy their walk no matter what the weather.

'Obviously nobody really likes the wet dog smell in their house either so it can help reduce that too.'

The Puppia dog umbrella is available through distributor PetLondon, priced £24.

'The umbrella helps them enjoy their walk no matter what the weather,' says Melody Lewis, director at PetLondon
