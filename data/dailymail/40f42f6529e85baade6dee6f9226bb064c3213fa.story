This is the first picture of the father-of-one whose body parts were found at a recycling plant.

Matthew Symonds, 34, was found at the Biffa waste depot in Avonmouth, Bristol, on Friday morning.

Police believe he may have been transported 45 miles in a recycling bin from his home town of Swindon.

Grim: The body parts of Matthew Symonds, 34, were discovered at a recycling plant in Bristol

Wiltshire Police's senior 
investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Bevan said 
officers were still keeping an open mind with the investigation.

He
 said: 'Police enquiries so far suggest the body was transported with 
commercial recycling waste collected in Swindon and therefore the focus 
of the investigation will be in that area going forward.

'The
 investigation is at an early stage and we are keeping an open mind 
about the circumstances leading to his death. Our thoughts are with his 
family and friends at this very difficult time.'

According to neighbours Mr Symonds was being pursued by drug dealers in the past.

Shocking: Staff at Avonmouth recycling plant in Bristol were horrified to find human remains among the waste

Investigation: Police arrived at the depot at 11am yesterday morning and immediately seized the site

A man described how someone came to 
his door by mistake and told his girlfriend he would 'stab up' Mr 
Symonds because of an unpaid debt.

Mr Symonds' own Facebook page revealed he had just recently been released from prison halfway through an eight-month sentence.

At Booth House, the Salvation Army's base in the centre of Swindon, staff referred enquiries about Mr Symonds to local police.

One
 resident at the site recognised Mr Symonds as someone who had been 
staying there as recently as the weekend of July 26 and 27.

Suspicions: The dismembered body may have been thrown into a recycling bin in Swindon, Wiltshire, police say

Enquiries: Police are now working to identify the victim and determine how long ago the body was discarded

He said: 'He was a nice enough guy, normal and chatty. He seemed pretty sociable.

'He had just come out of Bullingdon (Prison). I think it was for shop thefts, something like that - nothing violent.'Mr Symonds' entries on Facebook include comments indicating his grief at losing his mother, Madeline Leadbetter, who died last year.

He indicated that he had found her dead on the morning of September 9, two days after he was released from jail after serving six weeks of a 12-week sentence.

His comments also show Nazi sympathisings.

As well as a drawing of a Second World War German soldier, with a swastika behind him, on March 19 this year he ranted: 'I dont give a f*** about no 1 except my self and family any more.heil f***ing hitler.'

On the same day he wrote: 'sieg hail.hail hitler' (sic).

It is not the first time a body has been found a waste depot in Avonmouth.

In 2012, Canadian student Garrett Elsey was found at the New Earth Solutions Site, which is also in Bristol.

The 22-year-old - who had been out drinking while celebrating his first night in the UK - fell asleep in a wheelie bin before it was emptied hours later.

An inquest later heard Mr Elsey was crushed to death in the back of the bin lorry.
