Police have been forced to detonate a 'dangerous' home-made bomb that was found in a 22-year-old man's bedroom by his mother, who then reported the suspicious package.

Harley Turnbull is believed to have brought the object to his Western Sydney home in Werrington County shortly before departing again with a friend.

'Potentially it could have been quite catastrophic, being an explosive device,' Inspector Michael Cruickshank said of the cylindrically shaped, 15cm long device, according to Nine News.

'Obviously they're dangerous in the wrong hands.'

The home-made bomb was found in Harley Turnbull's bedroom by his mother on Tuesday night. He has been described as having the word 'faithful' tattooed above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left

However Mr Turnbull's sister told the ABC that she believed her brother did not know what the device was.

'[It was] just a little black package about the size of a mobile phone that was taped up with wire hanging out of it,' Shayleen Butt said.

Police are now searching for Mr Turnbull, who has been described as having the word 'faithful' tattooed above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left and is yet to be found following the bomb's discovery.

His brother-in-law, Neil Jones, told Nine News  that the 22-year-old had said the device was a home-made firework.

'He's gone outside to an unknown car and come back inside with a package, he's dropped it off and p***ed off again,' Mr Jones said. 

Officers were called to the home at about 10:30pm, where they examined the object before promptly evacuating the home and detonating the bomb in a nearby field 

'The bomb squad said it was the real deal, it's serious, it got a bit worrying then.'

Officers were called to the home at about 10:30pm, where they examined the object before promptly evacuating the home.

They were spotted carrying a number of bags and packages out of the property during their investigation. 

The home-made explosive was then taken to an empty nearby field where it was detonated before 4am.

Police have admitted the bomb was unlikely to have been capable to cause great damage, however they have released a public description of Mr Turnbull in an effort to locate and question him.

'I would like to stress to the community that this was a one-off incident,' Inspector Cruickshank said while dismissing the idea that the incident was terrorism-related.

'There were no threats made and no person was put at risk.'

Mr Turnbull is described as being 180-185cm tall, of thin build, Caucasian appearance and light brown hair.

When he was last seen, he was unshaven and had tattoos of the word 'faithful' above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left eye.
