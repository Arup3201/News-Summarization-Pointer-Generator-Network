There's just a few hours to go until Christmas Eve and Santa's reindeer in Lapland are getting ready for their biggest job of the year.

But much further south in Scotland, the UK's only free-roaming herd of reindeer don't seem to have a care in the world as they wander across the snow-capped hills of the east Highlands.

Rather than calling Lapland their home, the 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd can be found in two locations north of the border - and are now quite an attraction.

Forget Lapland...these reindeer are Scottish: The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd is Britain's only herd of reindeer, found free ranging in the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland

Scottish
 home: The herd rages on 2,500 hectares of hill ground between 450 and 
1,309 meters and stay above the tree line all year round regardless of 
the weather

Hard-going: Eve Grayson, a Reindeer herder of the Cairgorm Reindeer Herd, feeds the reindeer this morning battling heavy snowfall as she goes

Almost ready for Christmas Eve: Reindeer were introduced to Scotland in 1952 by Swedish Sami reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi which has now grown in number

Around 50 animals can be found ranging
 the Cairngorm Mountains while the remainder stay the Glenlivet Estate -
 some 30 miles away.

This morning, Eve Grayson was pictured battling the elements to herd the beautiful animals as snow swept across the landscape.

The reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a Swedish reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi.

He started with just a few reindeer, but the herd has grown over the years.

Hardy: Every reindeer regardless of sex or age grows a new set of antlers every year and they have thick winter coats for arctic life

Weather conditions: They have extra wide, splayed hooves so they can spread weight on soft snow to prevent them sinking

Tasty snacks: Reindeer enjoy nibbling on edible mushrooms, lichens and Arctic vegetation - not just carrots - and their calves are born in the spring

It is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding, with most deer being born in the summer months.

An account of the introduction written by Mr Utsi is featured on the official website for the animals.

In
 it, he says: 'Looking across Rothiemurchus Forest to the Cairngorms 
from the railway bridge at Aviemore on a cold morning in April 1947, I 
was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in Lapland.

Friendly: Reindeer can be very friendly and enjoy following people about, however during the rutting season bulls can be threatening

Herding: In Lapland dogs help with the herding of reindeer but at Glenmore in Scotland they are controlled by voice and titbitsÂ 

'In
 1952, I brought some of my Swedish mountain reindeer to Scotland as an 
experiment, to show that they could live and breed in these 
surroundings.

'Official 
difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the 
interest shown by the Press and the influence of the Reindeer Council of
 the United Kingdom.'

The animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of November and December.

Uses: Reindeer are bred for meat and clothes can be made from the skin or hide. Reindeer hair is often used for weaving into expensive dress materials

Santa's little helper: The hard-working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months

In
 winter, a daily visits to the herd departs from the Reindeer centre in 
Glenmore - with guides taking visitors to the animals.

Some of the friendlier reindeer have been known to search through rucksacks and follow visitors around on their tour.

In
 the winter months, teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit Christmas 
parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive 
spirit.

The hard-working creatures also appear at certain promotional events and even work in film studios.

Running free: The herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding
