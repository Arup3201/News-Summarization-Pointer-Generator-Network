New York Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak resigned Sunday after mounting accusations of sexual harassment from several staffers led to calls for him to step aside.

Mr Gabryszak, a married father of two, announced he would 'retire' after demands he step down came from all corners of state government, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Buffalo-area politician has been accused of harassment by at least seven staffers

Six current female staffers, as well as a former employee, claim the assemblyman's unwanted advances include taking them to massage parlors and sending at least one woman a video of a sex act being performed on him.

Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak, D-Cheektowaga, speaks last year in the Assembly Chamber at the Capitol in Albany, N.Y. The embattled politician resigned Sunday amid several claims of sexual harassment

The embattled politician claimed in his announcement that he is innocent, but said he was stepping aside to mitigate the negative impact the scandal is having on both his family and the state assembly.

Mr Gabryszak wrote in a resignation letter published by the Buffalo News that 'there was no sexual contact between me and any members of my staff' and 'there was never a request that sexual contact should occur.'

He also claimed he never intended to create a hostile work environment.

'In fact, there are allegations that have been made that are demonstrably false,' he continued, without refuting any specific claims.

'There was mutual banter and exchanges that took place that should not have taken place because it is inappropriate in the workplace even if it does not constitute sexual harassment,' Mr Gabryszak admitted.

The outgoing politician also said he will continue to fight the allegations in court and will not have any further comment at this time.

New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) said in a statement that Mr Gabryszak stepping aside was the right decision.

Ethics Committee Chairman Charles Lavine (D-Nassau County) told the New York Daily News the move ends his investigation into Mr Gaabryszak's conduct since his committee has no jurisdiction over former state representatives.

The announcement came one month after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that Mr Gabryszak should resign if the allegations are true.

'He has to be out. Period. End of story,' Cuomo told WIBTV.

Erie
 County Democratic Chairman Jereemy Zellner told WGRZ 'there is no place for this type of conduct, the work place should be a safe and respectful environment for 
employees.'

More than half a dozen current or former staffers have filed claims of misconduct against the longtime local politican.

The latest accusation came from longtime communications director Kristy Mazurek, the Daily News reported.

Ms Mazurek, 43, said in a court filing that Mr Gabryszak suggested she and another female staffer dress up as sexy elves and sit on his lap for an office Christmas photo.

Kimberly Snickles, 26, who also served as Director of Communications, from May 2013 through October 2013, alleges that she was asked by Gabryszak to accompany him to a massage parlor her first week on the job.

Ms Snickles also says that Mr Gabryszak asked her to stay over at his apartment. She claims he even joked to both her and an intern that he had a 'tattoo on his penis.'

In her testimony, Ms Snickles says Mr Gabryszak 'regularly told her and a co-worker that they should wear bikinis to his events.' Ms Snickles claims that she scheduled a meeting with him regarding his behavior -- but he never showed up.

Jamie L. Campbell, 24, Mr Gabryszak's former legislative director from 2010 to 2013, says she received a video from him in 2011 that showed the man in a bathroom stall 'either receiving or pretending to be receiving fellatio.'

Ms Campbell's testimony also says that Mr Gabryszak frequently told her about women he wanted to have sex with, and 'alluded to a prior affair with a former assemblywoman.' He also reportedly talked about prostitutes and going to a strip club regularly.

In one of the most shocking allegations, she says Mr Gabryszak offered her $100,000 to move to relocate for her job. When Ms Campbell said that she couldn't because of her fiance, Mr Gabryszak allegedly said 'I guess I will just have to get your fiance to break up with you.'

The third former staffer involved in the suit, Annalise C. Freling, 28, who served as Director of Communications from 2011 through 2013, claims Mr Gabryszak attempted to take her out on Valentine's Day in 2011 and give her a set of pearls.

Ms Freling says Mr Gabryszak made a 
number of remarks on her appearance, including 'you're so hot, you know 
what I want to do with you.'

The lewd comments led Ms Freling to stop putting on makeup and doing her hair for work, she claims.

She also claimed Mr Gabryszak called her when he forgot his wallet while at a massage parlor, and was pressured into bringing it to him. He also frequently asked her to get massages with him.

Mr Gabryszak's public persona was different than the one being portayed in court filings, he even supported a 2012 law to help stop psychological abuse and intimidation in the workplace, the Times Union noted.

Johnny Destino, a Niagra Falls-based lawyer representing the women, previously told the Buffalo News 'a minimum of two additional former employees' will come forward to bring similar allegations.
