A curious baby deer has made a couple of new friends after wandering into the backyard of a home in Wisconsin. 

Dad James Vee captured a video of the wild animal playing happily with his two young daughters on one of its regular visits to the family home.

The little girls playfully toss leaves over the white-tailed baby deer, who seems totally unconcerned by the human contact and happily hops around them.

The deer has been visiting the Vee household for the past few weeks and seems to have grown an attachment to the blond-haired sisters.

White-tailed deer are the smallest members of the North American deer family and are found widely throughout the United States.

In the past, unrestricted hunting in North America depleted the numbers of the species, but strict game-management measures have helped restore the white-tailed deer population.

The fawns are reddish-brown at birth with white spots that help camouflage them, giving them their distinctive Bambi-like appearance.
