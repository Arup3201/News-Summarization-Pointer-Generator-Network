A man's decomposing body was discovered behind a digital billboard at Times Square Thursday, two days after he jumped to his death from a midtown hotel.

Police believe the suicide victim, whose name has not been released, took the fatal leap from a balcony at Hilton Times Square Hilton, landing behind a digital sign on a building that houses Ripley's Believe It Or Not, Madame Tussaud's wax museum and Modell's Sporting Goods store.

According to investigators, the man took his own life sometime Tuesday and his body lay undiscovered for two days until someone spotted it just before 11.30am Thursday.

The New York Daily News reported that the man was captured on video plummeting to his death from the 44-story Hilton Times Square at 234 West 42nd Street Tuesday.

A source told the paper that no suicide note has been found.

Police blocked 42nd Street to traffic to remove the body from behind the billboard, the scene attracting a large crowd of curious onlookers, according to amNewYork.

Some of the gawkers took photos of police working to retrieve the man's decomposing remains three stories above street level.

"It's crazy. I don't know how people can do that,’ said eyewitness David Sanchez. ‘This is the heart of New York City. To see something like this go down, it's shocking.’
