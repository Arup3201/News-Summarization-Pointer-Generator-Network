Everton duo Kevin Mirallas and James McCarthy could both return to action for the Toffees’ Boxing Day clash with Stoke at Goodison Park.

Belgium winger Mirallas picked up an ankle injury after a poor challenge from QPR’s Jordon Mutch last week, causing him to miss Saturday’s 3-0 defeat at Southampton.

McCarthy, who has struggled with injuries this term, has been out since suffering a hamstring problem against Wolfsburg in late November.

But manager Roberto Martinez has confirmed that both players have a chance of featuring in Friday’s game against the Potters.

Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Martinez said: ‘Kevin Mirallas has got a great chance to be involved over the next two games. We don’t know yet if the Stoke game is going to be too early but he has an opportunity, which is fantastic news.

‘James McCarthy is very similar to Kevin. I do think he will be involved one way or another over the next two games.’

Tony Hibbert, Leon Osman and Darron Gibson will all miss the clash with Mark Hughes’ side and Sunday’s trip to St James’ Park to face Newcastle United.
