Hundreds of terrified parents were left panicking after a school wrongly reported their children were missing after accidentally sending them a bulk truancy text using its automated service.

On Monday, the parents of children at Wadebridge School in Cornwall received the text message saying their kids had not arrived for the day.

But when they frantically called the school they were told the message had been sent in error.

Despite the school's initial claims there was an issue with its automated truancy service, it was later confirmed that the message was sent after a mistake was made by those operating the service.

One grandmother said that her daughter, who has a child at the secondary school, had been 'frightened to death' by the text.

She said: 'She went haring to the school. She thought something had happened to my grandchild. She's still in a state of shock now.'

Sharon Meehan, 42, works at the Molesworth Arms Hotel in Wadebridge.

She has a son in year seven called Patrick. She said: 'My husband got the message and rang me while I was at work. He was going mental because obviously we both thought that Patrick was in school.

'I thought he had not gone to school that morning, had walked out or just missed registration. It is worrying though, especially when you are at work and your son has only just started at the school. 

'What's worse is that it took me half an hour to get through and this is the second time this has happened to me. My husband works away and it is really hard to imagine what would have happened if Patrick had genuinely gone missing. The school need to sort it out.'

Gabriella Cleave, 38, of Wadebridge, is unemployed, and received the text to say her son Jake, 12, was absent from the school.

She said: 'It was a bit of a strange experience to go through. I was at home and this text came through to say that Jake was absent.

'That sparked off a big panic. I knew that Jake had got on the bus up the road, so I phoned my husband panicking.

'All kinds of potential scenarios were going through my head. I thought the bus might have crashed or someone might have grabbed him – all kinds of things were going through my mind.

'It was worrying. I was trying to phone the school for about 30 minutes but I could not get through as it was engaged. I just thought – where on earth is he? Jake is not one to play truant and I had never seen a message like that before.

'After a while I phoned a friend, who said she had got the same message about her son and we started to think someone might have hacked the school’s message system.

'But none of us could not get through to the school. I think every parent must have been trying to get through.

'Some of the parents have been saying it was not that bad. But me and my friends were very worried.

'I still cannot understand how it happened. At first I was a bit angry – but now I am just confused by it all. And just thankful it turned out that nothing had happened to my son.'

Parent Melanie Barber, said: 'I was concerned that my daughter wasn't at school, but as the school switchboard was then constantly engaged for 10 minutes, I made the assumption that lots of people were calling in, and so it was likely that the message had been sent to a lot of people.

Headteacher Tina Yardley (pictured) has since apologised to all parents who received the alarming message

Another mother, who asked not to be named, confirmed she had received the text alongside an apology approximately 20 minutes later.

She said: 'I heard that they contacted every single person they had a number for by accident. 'It must have been hundreds and hundreds of people. Obviously there is an amusing slant but as a parent receiving that text it was really worrying.

'Even if you knew where your child was, like I did, you still question it.'

Headteacher Tina Yardley apologised to parents who received the text.

She said the school uses electronic alerts if a child fails to arrive - but was 'completely unaware' of the problem until messages started to flood in.

'We use the 'Truancy Call' system to send a text to the parent or carer to alert them to a child being absent in the morning register,' she said.

'This will always take place before 11am. Parents and carers then text back at various points during the day to explain why.'

Ms Yardley said that on Monday their attendance officer was trying to see if they had received any new messages but instead sent a 'truancy text'.

Parents got the message just after 2pm. Ms Yardley would not disclose what was in the message but it is thought that it contained the child's name, said they were absent from school and asked the parents to call or respond.

Staff were only made aware of the mistake by children asking questions and parents calling the office.

Although it was initially claimed it was the fault of the automated truancy system, Ms Yardley later said it was an 'administrative' issue.
