The fairy lights will not go out on Arsenal's title tilt this Christmas but recent history will count against them should they surrender top spot in the Barclays Premier League this coming weekend. 

Heading into the Yuletide period, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea are all in with a shout of being top on Christmas Day and there could hardly be a greater incentive - the last four title winners were also all top of the tree heading into the festive period.

Heading for the top: Liverpool's Luis Suarez celebrates scoring the opener during the 5-0 thrashing of Spurs

Chelsea.....................................2010        1

Manchester United.....................2011        1

Of course, it offers no assurance of success but it is an encouraging omen and one that is only accentuated when we look a little further back to discover that seven of the last nine Premier League champions assumed first place on Christmas Day. 

Arsenal can guarantee their place at the summit with a win over Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Monday evening but should they falter, others could move in to seal the Christmas No 1. 

Liverpool, who have scored 14 goals in their past three leagues games, will leapfrog Arsene Wenger's side with victory at home to Cardiff on Saturday lunchtime and - courtesy of a superior goal difference - they will remain there for Christmas should Arsenal fail to defeat Chelsea.

As for Jose Mourinho's side, they will only go top if they take all three points from the Emirates and if Liverpool are unable to beat Cardiff on Saturday. 

Yet with just four points separating Arsenal in first and Everton in fifth, the title race has rarely been more difficult to call. 

Last week's humbling at Manchester City offered the first indications that the wheels may be coming off Arsenal's pursuit. The Gunners appearing exhausted after a gruelling schedule pitted a Saturday lunchtime kick-off at the Etihad in the same week as assignments against Everton and at Napoli. 

For seasoned Arsenal followers though, defeat against Mourinho's Chelsea would feel so wearingly typical - Wenger is still to defeat the Portuguese manager in nine previous meetings. 

Fortunately for Arsenal, imperfections remain among their title rivals. 

City themselves continue to belie their majesty at the Etihad with listless showings away from home, where they have conceded more than they have scored and a trip to Fulham this weekend is exactly the kind of match they must negotiate to back up their flamboyant showing against Arsenal.

Leading man: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger

Sniffing around: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers

In with a shout: Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho

In Luis Suarez, Liverpool have the gift that keeps on giving but the next fortnight represents an acid test of their credentials. For Brendan Rodgers' side, it will be a Christmas in the workhouse, with visits to Manchester City and Chelsea before Big Ben strikes on New Years Eve, in a three-day double-header that will reveal much about the durability of the Anfield challenge. 

There is no shortage of Christmas crackers to come, as Chelsea, whose form remains unconvincing, pockmarked by sloppy defending and a misfiring forward line will also come under pressure, facing Arsenal, Liverpool and a visit to Southampton. 

At some point, the threat from Goodison Park must be taken more seriously. The challenge for Everton will be keeping their first-team fresh and ready to shine but Roberto Martinez has four pretty negotiable fixtures upcoming - Swansea, Sunderland, Southampton and Stoke.

The statistics read less favourably for Manchester United, who will be placed no higher than sixth on Christmas Day, and possibly below, should Tottenham or Newcastle win their respective matches.

What they're playing for: Sir Alex Ferguson lifts the Premier League trophy last May

Leading light: Arsenal are top of the Premier League but have stuttered recently and were thumped 6-3 at City - Alvaro Negredo here scoring the second past Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny

United, may, however sense an opportunity to cut down that 10 point gap. As their rivals face off in quick succession, Yuletide resembles a season of goodwill for the Champions with West Ham, Hull and Norwich next on the agenda. 

Only once before has a team languishing in sixth on Christmas Day gone on to lift the Premier League title - Arsenal's 1998 side, which went 21 games unbeaten, winning 18 of those after a poor first half of the season. 

You would imagine that David Moyes now requires a similarly improbable run of stunning consistency to hand United any chance whatsoever of retaining their crown.

Standing out from the crowd: West Brom fans celebrate survival in 2005 when they became the only side bottom at Christmas to avoid the drop

Champagne moment: Baggies2005 boss Bryan Robson celebrates completing mission impossible. Sunderland of 2013/14 will be hoping to emulate West Brom's feat

Never before has a team positioned below sixth on Christmas Day recovered to win the Premier League title. 

If you think United's chances are slim, spare a thought for poor old Sunderland, who are already consigned to bottom spot this Christmas, after recording a measly nine points so far this season and falling four points adrift of fellow strugglers Crystal Palace and Fulham. 

History dictates that Gus Poyet's side are all but finished - only one side that was bottom at Christmas have recovered to stay up in the Premier League era - Bryan Robson's West Bromwich Albion in 2005. 

It's a good job football isn't played on paper, eh?
