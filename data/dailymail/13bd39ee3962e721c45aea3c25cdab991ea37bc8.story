A pub put up a Christmas tree more than four months early - but was forced to take it down when customers complained. 

Excited manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn 
restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go.

But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had now taken down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.

This 12ft Christmas tree was put up in the Bybrook Barn Harvester restaurant in Ashford, Kent, 140 days before Christmas - but has now been taken down

The manager said it had all been a 'bit of banter' to promote the fact the restaurant had started taking bookings, but that several customers had made negative comments.

He said: 'It was all a bit of banter, to tie in with the fact we are now taking bookings for Christmas parties, but the banter sort of backfired.

'People
 did not necessarily complain but people made comments that it was a bit
 too early to have a tree. So we took it down. We will just have to delay Christmas a little bit longer.'

Mr Robinson said that, last year, they promoted their Christmas bookings using a model of Father Christmas.

He admitted this year's efforts were a little 'overboard' and said he received an email from bosses at Harvester suggesting it was too early to have the tree.

The Harvester chain said the decorations promoting their Yuletide menus should not normally appear until Autumn.

The tree baffled diners, including Darren Payne, 47, and his fiance Belinda, 40, who went to the restaurant with 11 month-old daughter Eliza-Rose.

Mr Payne a pharmaceuticals worker, said: 
'It was quite a shock to be greeted by a Christmas tree in August. I 
understand that they are just getting in early for the Christmas 
bookings.'

Diner Sam Richards, 35, also said: 'I went into Harvester and came face to face with a Christmas tree covered in fairy lights.

'I
 don’t even want to be thinking about Christmas yet - it’s still 25C 
outside and the height of summer - what are these muppets thinking 
about?'

Mum-of-two Tracy Sommerville said: 'As soon as I walked in with my two little ones my heart sank.

'All
 I’m getting now is them rattling on about when Father Christmas is 
coming and what presents they would like. I don’t need this in August.'

A Harvester spokesman said: 'We do have our Christmas menus available now, as some of our guests like to book up early.

'However it looks like our manager has got into the Christmas spirit a little too soon - we normally don’t put our Christmas decorations up until the Autumn.'
