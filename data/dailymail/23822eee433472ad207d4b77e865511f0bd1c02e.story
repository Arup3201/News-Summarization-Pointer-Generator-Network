A Rutgers University football player on the Scarlett Knights has come forward with claims that the team's coach has been verbally abusing and bullying players.

Freshman cornerback, Jevon Tyree, 19, quit the football team on November 6 after coach Dave Cohen called him profanities and once even threatened to 'head-butt him during a study hall session.' There were 10 students and a tutor present during the incident.

Jevon's parents, Mark and Clarice, are outraged by the 'bullying' and are seeking disciplinary action against Cohen.

'I really think disciplinary action should happen, almost to the point where (Cohen) should get fired. I really do,' Mark Tyree told NJ.com

'He was just trying to really make me feel as if I was soft.' Tyree said.

'He got all up in my face. Coach Cohen has a lisp , so he was in my face telling me he'll head-butt me, and he was kind of spitting in my face as he was saying it. I was just pulling my head back, looking at him like, is this guy out of his mind? Is he crazy?,' Tyree told NJ.com.

The school issued a statement about the alleged bullying that said, 'at no time was there any threat of physical violence, which was verified by an academic counselor, who was present in the room.'

The statement also said that the head coach, Kyle Flood, spoke with Cohen about his behavior and that the next day the coach apologized. 

Tyree's parents were not placated by the statement which says that they met with the school several times and felt that the issue was resolved.

The statement claimed that athletic director Julie Hermann spoke with Jevon's father and that they, 'confirmed that the matter was resolved to his satisfaction.'

The family says this is untrue. In fact, Mark Tyree has been unable to have a meeting with Hermann despite his numerous attempts. 

Julie Hermann, Athletic Director of Rutgers University, didn't make herself available to meet with Jevon's family even though a statement issued by the school says she did

'We didn't even want this to escalate to the athletic director,' Mark Tyree told The Star Ledger. 'We were trying to keep this in-house. I wasn't trying to go to the [university] president and the NCAA. I was like, 'Hey, let's try to resolve this.'

According to Mark Tyree, Flood said, 'Mr. Tyree, I'm not going to tell you how I discipline my coaches.' I understand that, because that's in-house stuff, but what happens if nothing happens? How do you know? Where is the letter filed to (Hermann)?'

In addition to bullying, Jevon feels as though was given less playing time unfairly.

He also wasn't invited to meetings that secondary coach Darell Wilson held with the rest of the cornerbacks.

'Obviously, if every single corner(back) is going to a meeting and not me, there is something up,' Tyree said. 

Tyree decided to leave the team after On Nov.2, the Scarlet Knights, whose secondary had been racked by injuries, played a wide receiver at cornerback against Temple instead of Tyree, reported ESPN.

Tyree believes the bullying was instigated after he pulled a hamstring during a 40-yard dash. He thinks this made Cohen think of him as a less valuable player. The bullying escalated over time.

Basically, my dad went in there and told Coach Cohen there's going to be no more bullying towards me," Jevon Tyree said. "Basically that's what it was -- I was just bullied by him for no reason."

Rutgers' statement may be aimed at trying to save the school's reputation after they were forced to fire college basketball coach Mark Rice for bullying.

NBC reports that Rice has since apologized for the bullying incident that got him fired and said, 'there were some actions that were definitely bullying.'

Rice was recorded on camera throwing balls at players and using gay slurs during team practice. After the video was broadcast on ESPN, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie asked Rutgers to fire Rice. The Tyree family thinks that Cohen should get the same punishment.

Jevon, who is cousins with former NY Giant player David Tyree, wants to continue playing football even if it means he has to transfer schools.
