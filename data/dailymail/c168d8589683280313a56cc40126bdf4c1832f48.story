One of the oldest houses in Britain which was once won by Sir Francis Drake in a bet has gone on sale for £1.25 million, with a Lordship thrown in for good measure.

The Grade II-listed Manor at Sampford Spiney in Devon is thought to date back to the 800s and was noted in the Domesday Book.

It is now a quaint bed and breakfast on the edge of Dartmoor but was once the historic seat of Gerard de Spineto, Lord of Sampford.

Charming: This 1,000-year-old house once won by Sir Francis Drake on a bet has gone on sale for £1.25m

Historic: The ancient grade II listed Manor at Sampford Spiney in Devon is thought to date back to the 800s and was noted in the Domesday Book

In 1581, his descendants gambled away the five-bed property and were forced to hand over the deeds to Drake after losing a £500 wager.

A modern buyer will have to shell out 2,500 times that sum to land the remote property but will at least earn themselves the title 'Lord of the Manor'.

Current owners John Pugh, 80, and his wife Rosalind, 70, bought the Manor 25 years ago as a derelict shell but have worked with English Heritage to rebuild and refurbish it.

They are not sure if Drake ever lived in the house itself but the legendary adventurer certainly had ties to the village and spent his honeymoon there.

Quaint: Inside the house, there are centuries-old features including large granite fireplaces, arched granite doorways, granite mullion windows and a bread oven

Good gamble: Sir Francis Drake was given the deeds to the property in 1581 when he won a £500 wager with the descendents of Gerard de Spineto, the Lord of Sampford

Mrs Pugh said: 'We don't believe Drake ever lived here permanently. He owned a lot of property in the area and his main home was nearby at Buckland Abbey.

'Our research suggests he obtained it for £500 and that it was part-payment of a wager.'

Drake, who defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, bought Buckland Abbey in 1580 and obtained the Manor the following year, around the time he became an MP and Mayor of Plymouth.

He died in 1596 without leaving an heir and the house passed into the hands of his second in command, Jonas Bodenham, whom he treated as a son.

Bodenham eventually sold the Manor back to Sir Francis' brother Thomas.

It was rebuilt in 1607, restored again in 1935, and for a while became known as Hall Farm, due to its owner the Rev John Hall Parlby.

Following Parlby's departure from the farm it fell into disrepair but in 1987 it was saved by the Pughs.

Their property comes with three 
reception rooms, two large 17th and 19th century barns and a cluster of 
farm buildings set in an acre of woodland and 202 acres of common land.

Mrs Pugh added: 'Nobody can quite say exactly when the house was built. It was first recorded in 1028 but we think it could have been build as far back as the 800s.

'It was certainly well-established by the time of the Doomsday Book in 1086 when people were bringing their tithes here.

'It was rebuilt and extended in the early 17th century after it fell into his disrepair after Drake's death.

'He was a local man, he was born in nearby Tavistock, and after his seafaring he bought Buckland Abbey, at that time the adjoining parish to Sampford.

Location, location: The manor in Devon was obtained by Drake, who defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, in 1581, around the time he became an MP and Mayor of Plymouth

Idyllic: Mrs Pugh said her research suggested Drake stayed at the Manor when he went riding on Dartmoor, but it is not believed he ever lived there permanently

Legacy: Drake died in 1596 without leaving an heir and the house passed into the hands of his second in command, Jonas Bodenham, whom he treated as a son

'He acquired more and more property as they did in those days. There are various writings people have done over the years about he came to own it.

'Interestingly, there's no paperwork revealing much he paid for it and there are no receipts, which does rather lend credence to the story that it was a wager.'

Mrs Pugh said her research suggested Drake stayed at the Manor when he went riding on Dartmoor, where he built Drake's Leat, one of the first municipal watercourses in the country that supplied Plymouth with its drinking water.

Mrs Pugh, who has two adult children and a grandson, said: 'Inside the house we have the biggest bread oven you'll ever see, they would have baked bread here for the whole of the village.

'When I arrived there were stories of judges robes being found under the staircase and the kitchen was called the courtroom. It would have been the civic centre of the parish.

'I'm going to live near my grandson in Cornwall and I'll be very sorry to leave the place - it's a magical spot.'
