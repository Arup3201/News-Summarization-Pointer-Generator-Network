Marouane Fellaini is poised for talks with Louis van Gaal over his Manchester United future.

Napoli have confirmed the Belgian is one of six players they are considering for their midfield but all depends on United's valuation.

The Italians want a loan deal heavily subsidised by United for the 26-year-old. Liverpool midfielder Lucas and Lassana Diarra of Lokomotiv Moscow are among Napoli's other options.

Hairy times: Manchester United midfielder has emerged as a loan target for Napoli

Fellaini was signed by previous Red Devils boss Davis Moyes for £27million last year but failed to make an impact as, along with Moyes, he failed to make the summer switch from Goodison Park to United work.

The Belgian's stock rose again during the World Cup where he helped his country reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup, but the midfielder hasn't been at the front of Van Gaal's plans since the Dutchman took over at United.

Napoli bound? The Serie A side are also monitoring Liverpool midfielder Lucas
