A high-society doctor who committed suicide after being caught up in the 1960s Profumo scandal was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, a leading lawyer has claimed.

Outspoken barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC today launched a book which he hopes will prove osteopath Stephen Ward was not a pimp, as he was accused of being.

He argues that Ward was only prosecuted for living on the earnings of prostitutes because Home Secretary Henry Brooke wanted a scapegoat for the scandal, which nearly brought down the Conservative government.

Innocent? Stephen Ward, pictured outside his trial in 1963, was nothing more than a scapegoat for the Profumo scandal, according to a leading barrister

Campaign: Geoffrey Robertson QC has published a new book about the case seeking to vindicate Ward

Supporters: The lawyer posing today with Andrew Lloyd-Webber and former model Mandy Rice-Davies

The book, being published by Biteback Publishing, also claims that Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies were not prostitutes, but instead lived off Ward's earnings as a doctor and portrait painter.

Mr Robertson, a human rights lawyer who defended Salman Rushdie, is not the only high-profile figure to be speaking out on Ward's behalf during the 50th anniversary of the Profumo scandal.

Andrew Lloyd Webber has composed a new musical, entitled Stephen Ward, which premieres in London this month.

Ward is said to have introduced John Profumo, then Secretary of State for War, to Miss Keeler at a party at the stately home Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire.

After it emerged that she was also having an affair with a Soviet attach√©, Profumo was forced to resign.

The Profumo affair was considered 
emblematic of the early 1960s, a time when the traditional British way 
of life was rapidly being replaced by modern customs.

John
Profumo was forced to resign as Secretary of State for War in 1963 
after it emerged that he had lied to Parliament about his relationship 
with model and showgirl Christine Keeler.

The Conservative minister was 27 years older than his lover, and was married to actress Valerie Hobson.

The
scandal was even believed to endanger national security when it was 
revealed that Ms Keeler was also having an affair with Soviet spy 
Yevgeny Ivanov, as well as notorious drug dealer Johnny Edgecombe.

When
Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister later that year, his 
decision was widely thought to be linked to the fall-out from the 
affair.

Profumo, who died in 2006, devoted the rest of his life to rehabilitating his reputation through charity work.

Ward was put on trial, but took an overdose of sleeping tablets shortly after the judge's summing-up and was convicted while he lay in a coma, from which he never awoke.

Mr Robertson identifies two senior judges - Lord Parker (Chief Justice at the time) and Lord Widgery (the next Chief Justice) - who allegedly hid evidence from the jury which would have secured Ward's acquittal.

He explains 12 mistakes of law that supposedly produced an overwhelmingly unfair trial, and which he says require Ward's conviction to be posthumously overturned.

At a news conference today to launch the book, he claimed that the legal establishment has tried to cover up its behaviour during the trial.

The book, called Stephen Ward Was Innocent, OK, has been sent to the Criminal Cases Review Commission as an application to have the conviction overturned.

Mr Robertson said: 'This will provide an opportunity for the Court of Appeal to reconsider the worst unrectified miscarriage of justice in modern British history.'

His book, and the message that the time has come to overturn Ward's conviction, is endorsed by the two most recent Directors of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC and Lord Macdonald, the publishers said.

Others attending the news conference included Ms Rice-Davies and Lord Lloyd Webber.
