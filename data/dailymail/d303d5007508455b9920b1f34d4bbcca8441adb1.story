Fashion chain Republic has collapsed into administration putting 2,500 jobs at risk, it has today been confirmed.

Ernst & Young, announced today as administrator to the Leeds-based group, said the 121 shops would continue to trade while a buyer for the business is sought.

Republic started as a men’s denim retailer in 1986 under the Best Jeans brand in Leeds.

But it was hit by a 'sudden and rapid decline' in sales at the end of last month after poor trading results over the autumn. So far 150 staff have been made redundant at Republic’s headquarters in Leeds.

Administrator Hunter Kelly said: 
'Republic suffered poor trading results in the autumn, and whilst sales 
picked up in December there has been a sudden and rapid decline in sales
in late January.

Another 164 stores at DVD and games rental firm Blockbuster are to shut.

The latest planned closures, which threaten around 800 jobs, come on top of the 168 shops already identified for closure by Deloitte.

Blockbuster collapsed last month amid competition from internet firms and the digital streaming of movies and games.

Having started with 528 stores at the time of its appointment, Deloitte will continue to look for buyers for the stores not currently up for closure.

Joint administrator Lee Manning said: 'We have continued to review the performance of individual stores since our appointment a month ago and have concluded that further closures are necessary in order to restructure the company for sale.

'We are in discussions with a number of parties interested in purchasing all or parts of the business and will update on progress in due course.'

The 164 stores identified today employ an average of five members of staff and will close over the coming weeks.

Deloitte said: 'Staff in the stores affected by the closures will be facing redundancy. A dedicated employee helpline is in place and the company is running an employee assistance programme to help those staff facing redundancy find other jobs.'

Customers will be notified in advance of the closure so that they can return their outstanding rental items beforehand.

He added: 'We will continue to trade 
Republic, with a view to selling the business as a going concern.

'The 
brand Republic is well recognised, particularly in the North. It has a 
powerful website offering, owns well-known brand names, and has some 
very attractive and profitable stores.'

Republic, which targets the competitive youth fashion market, sells brands including Jack Jones, SoulCal, Diesel and Firetrap.

It was bought by private equity firm 
TPG in June 2010 in a deal worth around £300 million, with the founders 
understood to have retained a significant stake.

It concentrated sales focus in the north of 
England - an area that has been hit particularly badly by the recession - a move which
is thought to have contributed to poor trading.

Mr Kelly said the impact of recent 
poor results on cash flow had meant the business was unable to continue 
to operate outside of an insolvency process.

The chain’s decline follow a bleak start
to the year for the retail sector, with a series of high-profile firms 
having hit the wall.

Thousands of jobs have been axed 
after music retailer HMV, camera group Jessops and DVD and games rental 
group Blockbuster called in administrators last month.

Republic’s chairman Andy Bond, a 
former Asda boss, stepped down last week having handed in his notice 
last year after less than two years.

The chain recently hired ex-TK Maxx
boss Paul Sweetenham as chief executive.

Mr Kelly said: 'We are grateful for 
the continued support of all employees and customers during this time, 
and would like to thank everyone at Republic for their commitment and 
hard work as the business continues to trade.'

Republic's collapse into administration makes it the latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip recession.
