Mayor Michael Bloomberg has tried to clarify his remarks in an interview where he alleged that one of the Democrats trying to replace him is running a 'racist' campaign.

Bloomberg said that former public advocate Bill de Blasio was running a campaign that was based around 'class warfare and racist'.

'Well no, no, I mean, he’s making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it’s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he’s been doing,' Bloomberg said in an interview with New York Magazine.

Modern family: Bloomberg blasted Bill de Blasio's decision to regularly feature his wife Chirlane McCray (left) and their daughter Chiara (center) during the campaign

De Blasio, who is leading in the polls going into Tuesday's Democratic primary, is white and his wife Chirlane McCray is African American. They have two children and their son Dante- who has a very prominent afro- has been featured in a number of his father's ads.

Altering the words: Outgoing Mayor Bloomberg had an injection added to the quote so that it is clear he said 'Well, no, no, I mean' before saying that he thought de Blasio's campaign was racist

'I do not think he himself is racist,' Bloomberg said.

'It’s comparable to me pointing out I’m Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.'

Bloomberg's aides contacted New York Magazine shortly after the article was first published on Friday saying that the quote was missing an interjection.

Originally the quote did not have 'Well, no, no, I mean' and the New York Magazine editors said that it was 'inaudible in our audiotape of the interview, which was conducted over speakerphone'.

De Blasio's daughter Chiara came to his 
defense at a rally on Saturday, saying: 'I would say that 20 years ago, my 
dad did not know he was running for mayor, and he did not seek to marry a
black woman to put her on display'.

According to Salon, De Blasio responded at the same campaign event: 'All I can say is, I hope the mayor will reconsider what he said. I hope he’ll realize that it was inappropriate, and I think the people of this city are ready for us to move forward together.'

That togetherness is a point of contention- at least for Bloomberg- as he said that de Blasio based much of his platform around the idea that New York is a 'tale of two cities', turning the famous title into a slogan.

'I’ve never liked that kind of division,' Bloomberg said during the interview.

'Tearing people apart with this “two cities” thing doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s a destructive strategy for those you want to help the most. He’s a very populist, very left-wing guy, but this city is not two groups, and if to some extent it is, it’s one group paying for services for the other.

Making a statement: De Blasio's son Dante has been featured prominently in the campaign and has spoken in a number of his father's commercials

'It’s a shame, because I’ve always thought he was a very smart guy.'

His criticism of de Blasio did not stop there.

'And he doesn’t have any ideas. “I’m gonna raise the taxes.” You know that Albany, under no circumstances, nor the governor, under any circumstances, is going to allow that! So come up with some real ideas, Bill!' Bloomberg said.

Bloomberg has been careful not to give an official endorsement to any of the candidates running to replace him, though he has worked very closely with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn for the past seven years.

Down to the wire: De Blasio (right) is leading the Democratic race, and Christine Quinn (left) is now in third place after leading for much of the beginning months

The closest he came to giving her an endorsement came earlier in the New York Magazine interview when he said he supported the New York Times' decision to endorse Quinn as the Democratic candidate. It could not be considered a full show of support, however, as he also said they were right to choose Joe Lhota as their pick for the Republican candidate.

At the beginning of this year's long mayoral campaign, Quinn was very much seen as the person to beat, leading the five-person Democratic race the longest.

Now, de Blasio has 39 per cent of the Democratic vote heading into tomorrow's primary. Former comptroller Bill Thompson follows him with 25 per cent of the vote, and Quinn is in third place with 18 per cent.
