Patrico Kochman, 20, died from brain injuries in April this year - 13 days after tripping over a pothole while he was drunk and cracking his skull

A drunk university student died from 'unsurvivable injuries' after tripping in a pothole and cracking his skull as he made his way home from a friend’s birthday party.

Patrico Kochman, 20, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, was walking home alone after enjoying a night out with friends when the accident occurred in April this year.

CCTV footage showed the Bradford University undergraduate, who was more than twice over the legal drink-drive limit, walking 'unsteadily' away from the club.

He was later found lying unconscious in an pothole-ridden alleyway.

Mr Kochman, known as Pato, fractured his skull and developed bleeding on the brain. Despite emergency surgery, he died 13 days later.

At an inquest into his death, Mr Kochman's family was told the fall was 'a simple act with catastrophic consequences'.

Giving a verdict of accidental death, assistant coroner Mary Burke said: 'He has fallen and we can never be 
absolutely sure how. We know he was unsteady on his feet as shown on 
CCTV.

'I think the most likely explanation is that he has stumbled, 
fallen or tripped and struck his head - a simple act that sadly has had 
catastrophic consequences that resulted in an un-survivable injuries.'

After the hearing, his mother Sue Thompson took to Facebook to pay tribute to her son, saying her 'loyal' son had 'turned into the man we hoped he’d be'.

The inquest heard that the accident took place after the young man had been to several pubs in Huddersfield to celebrate his friend Jay Simms's birthday. 

CCTV showed Mr Kochman, who had been drinking Jack Daniel's and coke all night, leaving the club and walking ‘unsteadily’ along the nearby road at 2.10am.

Bradford Coroner's Court heard the young man would have been two-and-a-half times over the legal drink-driving limit, something which would have had an 'adverse effect' on his balance and judgement.

After being found by a passing taxi driver, Mr Kochman - who wanted to be an architect and was studying a design course - was taken to Huddersfield Royal 
Infirmary in West Yorkshire.

He was later transferred to the Intensive Care 
Unit at Leeds General Infirmary where medics discovered he had fractured his skull. He also sustained bleeding and bruising on the brain.

Although a craniotomy was carried out to relieve pressure in his brain, Mr Kochman did not recover.

During the inquest, Detective Constable 
Shaun Topham, the investigating officer, said the entrance to the scrap 
yard, where Mr Kochman was found, was 'filled with potholes'.

He told the court: 'He could have easily
 tripped. It was the entrance to a skip yard was filled with pot holes -
 it was uneven and it wasn’t tarmacked.

'We
 were contacted by Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. Initially we weren’t 
aware of what had happened to Pato.

'We were not sure of any criminality 
at that point. I went to the scene and identified the CCTV footage and 
also spoke to the people he was with during the previous evening.

'Pato
 had everything with him - his wallet and mobile phone. A taxi driver 
found Pato as he was driving along Wakefield Road. He said Pato was 
breathing but unconscious.

'There
 had been nobody with Pato at the time and the paramedics had not 
thought anything was suspicious about the scene - it is standard 
procedure for them to call the police if they think there is. There was 
nothing to suggest an attack or anything untoward had taken place.'

A toxicology report carried out by Richard Sykes of the West Yorkshire Analytical Services showed Mr Kochman would have had 200microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80mg.

DC Topham added: 'Jay said they had met at his house and had some drinks before getting a taxi into town.

'When
 they were dropped off in the town centre they visited various drinking 
establishments, mainly drinking Jack Daniels and coke.

'They ended up in a night club in Huddersfield where they all separated and Pato went off on his own.

'Jay
 said he was standing outside having a cigarette. He saw Pato come 
outside and him trying to get back in. He said Pato looked intoxicated. 
They shared a cigarette and Jay went back inside.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Ms Burke said: 'Pato was seen on CCTV footage alone and walking in an unsteady manner away from Huddersfield town centre.

'He was then found by a taxi driver at the entrance of an alley way just off Wakefield Road.

'I think the most likely explanation is that he has stumbled, 
fallen or tripped and struck his head - a simple act that sadly has had 
catastrophic consequences that resulted in an unsurvivable injuries'

Assistant coroner Mary Burke

'He had been out with his friends celebrating his friend’s birthday party on April 16.

'The night had begun with some drinking at a friend’s house and the party had gone into Huddersfield and ended up in a night club.

'There they separated. Sometime in the early hours he was seen by one of his friends outside the club and the friend goes back in.

'CCTV footage shows Pato walking in an unsteady manner along Wakefield Road. He was found in an alley off that road by a taxi driver.

'An ambulance is called and they do not think anything suspicious happened. After tests at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary it is revealed that he has a fractured skull, brain bleed and bruising to the brain also - a very significant injury.

'He is transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where he undergoes surgery. His condition doesn’t improve and he is taken off full medication. Doctors told the family that he suffered an un-survivable injury.

'My belated condolences go out to you and all the rest of his family who couldn’t be here today.'

In her tribute, Ms Thompson wrote: 'If he was your friend you could not have anyone more loyal.

'Pne of the last conversations I had with him was over his concerns for one of his friends... We were plotting together as to how we could help him get his life back on track. It is nice for us to know that the boy we loved had turned into the man we hoped he’d be.

'Pato’s death was a tragic accident but from the moment I heard the news God was right by my side and has given me the strength that has carried me through thus far. I am not angry with God and I wouldn’t like you to be either.

'Pato’s Dad Robby, and I, both promised Pato before he died that we would try to live our lives to make him proud. Let’s hope all of us can live our lives less angry, more forgiving and more loving than we would have done if this had not happened.'
