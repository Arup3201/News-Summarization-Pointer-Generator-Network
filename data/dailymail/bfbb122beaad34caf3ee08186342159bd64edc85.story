More than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries, it was revealed today.

Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire.

Animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘impossible to justify medically, ethically or educationally’, but the Ministry of Defence insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare.

Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs

The figures emerged in Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mirror, after it was revealed British military were taking part in twice-yearly training courses nicknamed Operation Danish Bacon.

Some
 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012 - and animal 
welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has 
urged the military to stop the practice now.

The
 group said that more than 80 per cent of Britain’s allies in the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) - including 20 EU member states - no
 longer train military medical personnel using animals.

A
 spokesman told MailOnline: ‘To shoot, stab or blow up live pigs in 
order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting 
modern warfare with muskets.

‘Vastly
 superior non-animal trauma training methods, including life-like 
human-patient simulators, are available and used by the militaries of 23
 of the UK's 27 Nato allies.

‘It's
 time for the military to end its participation in these inhumane and 
ill-conceived exercises for the sake of both our fighting forces and 
animals.’

Animal cruelty? Military surgeons who serve in the British Forces taking part in controversial medical training

Carted away: Some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012, figures have revealed

The 2010 pigs were blown up to see if they could be saved after suffering ‘severe battlefield trauma’, while the 2011 pigs were being tested for the effectiveness of blood clotting products.

Tests on those killed in 2012 were for finding out more about both methods, reported the Mirror's Martin Bagot.

But the MoD believes the practice is vital for safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents, and developing methods that have saved lives in Afghanistan.

The exercises are also said to have developed a safe treatment for botulism for the armed forces – which has also been used in civilian cases of the infection in Britain and abroad.

A MoD spokesman said: ‘The research we undertake saves lives. It develops world class protective equipment for our troops as well as advances in medical treatment that have benefited those injured on the battlefield as well as civilians.

‘Countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons and improving the treatment of casualties on the battlefield cannot currently be achieved without the use of animals.

‘We are increasingly using computer modelling and cell cultures to reduce the need for testing on animals. We are committed to increasing this and developing further alternatives.’

The MoD has killed 28,000 animals in various tests over the last three years, and the use of animals in military experiments in Britain is legal.

Peta UK obtained photographs last month of pigs being shot with an AK-47 assault rifle or a 9mm handgun in experiments attended by surgeons serving in Britain’s Armed Forces in Denmark.

During these experiments, sedatives are first mixed into the pigs’ food. When they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet. The animals are then taken to a shooting range, where marksmen try to ensure that their shots injure but do not kill.

The pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team of surgeons operates.
