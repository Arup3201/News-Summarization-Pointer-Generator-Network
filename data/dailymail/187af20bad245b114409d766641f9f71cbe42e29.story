Lisa Harnum, above, died after falling from the 15th floor of an apartment in Sydney, Australia in 2011

A witness in the murder trial of Simon Gittany, who is accused of throwing his ballerina fiancée from the balcony of a 15th floor apartment, told how he saw a shirtless man dropping a large 'object' into the street below, moments before Lisa Harnum was found dead on the pavement.

Radio producer Joshua Rathmell was walking to work in Sydney when he looked up after hearing a 'deranged scream' come from the high rise building above.

He then saw a man 'load' what he thought was a duffel bag over the balcony, before calmly walking back into the flat.

Mr Rathmell, giving evidence at the Supreme Court in Sydney, said he was walking through the central Hyde Park when he heard the disturbance.

He told jurors: ‘I heard what I thought was deranged screaming from a male voice.

‘My perception was that it was a male voice, very emotional, it sounded guttural.’

When he looked up he saw a man with no shirt carrying what appeared to be ‘black luggage'.

He added: ‘It was being held horizontally in the man’s arms. His arms were outstretched with the object lying across.

‘I
saw the man load the object off the balcony and in what I described as a
fluid motion, turned and went straight back into the apartment. I didn’t
really follow the item.’

Mr Rathmell said that when he reached the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets he realised it was a woman who had fallen.

Terror: His hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her 'bone-chilling' screams for help, a shirtless Simon Gittany wrestles fiancee Lisa Harnam - minutes before she plunged 15-storeys to her death. The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her

‘I walked up to two labourers standing near the object and said “Mate, is that a body?”’

By the time he realised what had fallen, other bystanders were already trying to resuscitate Miss Harnum.

Mr Rathmell said he later saw the man he thought had thrown the body walking out of 
the apartment block.

The witness said: ‘I
can’t 100 per cent clarify that the man I saw come out of the building 
was the man on the balcony, but I instinctively thought that he was.

At court: Gittany, 37, denies murdering Canadian-born Miss Harnam on July 30, 2011, claiming he was trying to stop her from jumping

‘He was grieving or reacting very emotionally to what had happened.’

Mr Rathmell is seen as a key witness by prosecutors who allege that Gittany, 37, murdered his Canadian born fiance after an argument on the night of July 30, 2011.

CCTV footage has shown Miss Harnum screaming as she left the front door of the apartment on the day of her death, before Gittany allegedly reached around her head, put his hand over her mouth and brought her back inside.

The 
30-year-old's terrifying last moments were captured on a pin-hole
camera Gittany set up to spy on her every 
move, the court heard.

Gittany, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Miss Harnum, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide before she fell.

He has been regularly accompanied to his trial by his current girlfriend.

A neighbour, however, claimed he saw a topless man 'fist-pumping' on the terrace after something had gone over the edge, 9News reported.

'Of course, it was not a piece of 
luggage, it was Miss Harnum wearing black clothing,' Crown prosecutor 
Mark Tedeschi QC said today at Gittany's murder trial.

Gittany was so jealous, Mr Tedeschi claimed, that he had banned her from seeing friends, 
forbade her from taking a job as a hairdresser and even hired a personal
trainer to come to their home so she wouldn't go to the gym where he 
thought she would be ogled by other men.

Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her.

'[He believed] it was her function in life to submit to his will as the male in the relationship,' Mr Tedeschi said.

But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages.

It was because of this forensic campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him with the help of two friends, the court heard. As a result he allegedly abused one of them over the phone, advising them to stay away.

In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnum had become so fearful of her fiancé's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men.

'The deceased's confidence became more and more diminished,' Mr Tedeschi said.

Giving evidence, Miss Harnum's 
mother said told the court: 'She told me he was always very controlling 
and wanted to always know where she was, what she was doing, who she was
with, what she was wearing.'

She
said when Miss Harnum plucked up the courage to tell Gittany she was 
leaving him, he threatened to destroy her chances of getting permanent 
Australian residency - a dream she had harboured since moving to the 
country.

Reign of fear: In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnam had become so fearful of Gittany's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men

Gittany's defence barrister Philip 
Strickland SC said Miss Harnum was a 'conflicted, complicated and 
confused woman' prone to over-reacting when she didn't get her own way.

Mr
Strickland said Gittany only monitored her text messages via a computer
programme because she had told him she had a secret that she couldn't 
disclose to him.

'The secret ate into their relationship,' he said

Her fingerprints were not found 
on the glass or metal rail of the balcony onto which he said she climbed
before she fell.
