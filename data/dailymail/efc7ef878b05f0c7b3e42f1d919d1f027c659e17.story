A man who got off on a manslaughter charge after beating his woe to death has been ordered to pay their daughter millions in damages.

Rafael Robb, 64, a highly respected University of Pennsylvania economics professor, admitted to bludgeoning his wife to death as she wrapped presents in their Wayne, Pennsylvania, home back in December 2006.

And, as a result of a plea bargain, he was sentenced in November 2008 to just 5 to 10 years in prison for his horrific crime.

In fact, Robb beat his wife, Ellen, so badly with a chin-up bar that her brain was actually coming out of her skull and police on the scene thought she had been shot in the face.

Now, a jury in Pennsylvania has made sure that Robb will have no quality of life once he does get released, awarding the couple's daughter Olivia, 20, a staggering $124.26 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

This after an emotional three days of testimony where Olivia was forced to once again face her father and remember that tragic day which occurred eight years ago. 

Jurors cried openly according to NBC 10, as Olivia detailed her heartbreak and all the memories she will never had now that she has no mother.

'My mother was my best friend,' she said.

And while her father has nowhere near the kind of money he has been asked to hand over, the amount will make sure he has no access to the millions he does still have.

'Olivia Robb is finally free from the haunting, controlling terror of her murderous father," said her attorney, Robert Mongeluzzi.

'The jury's verdict honored the memory of a caring, loving mother and at the same time sent a thunderous message to Rafael Robb, that he can no longer get away with his pathological lies, and that he will not be able to enjoy a life of luxury after his release in a few years.'

Rafael was denied parole after serving his first five years in January 2013.
