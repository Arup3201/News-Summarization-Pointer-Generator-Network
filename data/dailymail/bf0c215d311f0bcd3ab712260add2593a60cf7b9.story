A professional boxer has left his neighbour disabled for life after attacking her because her cat defecated outside his front door. 

Aleksandr Hokhlov, 26, punched Oksana Muronets to the ground and then stomped on her head after he spotted her walking home from work in the Russian capital Moscow.

CCTV footage shows Hokhlov approaching Ms Muronets, 34, from behind before knocking her to the ground with a single punch to the face.

While the 34-year-old lies motionless on the ground, Hokhlov then punches her several more times in the face before repeatedly stomping on her head. 

Kondrat Mishin, 28, saw the attack unfold, but was too fearful to intervene: 'I was walking towards this man who was leaning over a body.

'As I got closer I saw him drag the body round by its legs and as I passed them he told me to f**k off.

'I realised that although I should have done something he would have probably attacked me too.

'So I decided the best thing to do was contact the police.'

When police arrived they found Ms Muronets still lying in the street with serious concussion and injuries.

Ms Muronets, pictured, suffered serious head injuries as a result of the attack; a hospital spokesman said she can no longer walk or talk and will never fully recover from her injuries

A hospital spokesman said she suffered serious head injuries and is unable to walk and talk and will never fully recover.

The spokesman said: 'She can hardly speak and can only really communicate through writing things down.

'Although she has now had several operations our medical evaluation is that she will most likely remain disabled for the rest of her life.'

Police tracked Hokhlov down after viewing the CCTV footage and say that he admitted the assault.

A police spokesman said: 'He has confessed and said he did it after months of dispute with the woman who is his neighbour because her cats kept defecating outside his door.'

Hokhlov is now awaiting trial.
