If a bottle of Baileys doesn't suffice for your man this Christmas, Harrods thinks it has the answer.

The luxury department store has unveiled a £987,500.00 whisky set, which it prides as 'the masterpiece of a lifetime'.

The Dalmore Paterson comprises twelve unique whiskies from Master Distiller of The Dalmore, Richard Paterson himself.

That's one expensive tipple! Harrods has unveiled The Dalmore Paterson collection, a £987,500.00 range of twelve unique whiskies

Describing the alcoholic set on its website, Harrods writes: 'The collection is housed within a magnificent bespoke cabinet, along with twelve handcrafted crystal decanters, each adorned with a sterling silver collar and stag.

'These works of art are accompanied by Paterson’s own handwritten ledger, offering a rare insight into his craft.'

Richard Paterson has named each of the twelve whiskeys after people who have influenced him throughout his career, which you can read about in the 200-page calfskin ledger that took over 1000 hours to write.

The collection, which has just gone on display in the Fine Spirits Room at Harrods, contains a vintage whisky from 1926 dedicated to Alexander Matheson, the founder of the Dalmore distillery.

Naturally, the collection looks the part - it comes with its own bespoke cabinet and each bottle has a lead crystal decanter finished with hand-engraved silver.

Speaking about the extortionate tipple set, a spokesperson for Harrods told the Telegraph: 'It represents the lifetime’s work of one of the whisky industry’s most dedicated, respected and loved characters.

'Whoever buys this will own a truly unique collection of whiskies as well as a little bit of Richard himself, as he has put so much into its creation.'
