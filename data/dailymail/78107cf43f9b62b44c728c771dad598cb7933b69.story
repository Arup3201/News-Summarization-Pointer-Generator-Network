James Rodriguez - the undisputed star of this World Cup so far - says he dreams of playing in Spain and appeared to encourage an offer from Real Madrid.

The Colombian has netted five times in his first four games in Brazil, including a stunning volley against Uruguay on Saturday night.

While the 22-year-old has long since been known about as one of the brightest prospects in Europe, the last fortnight has shone a brighter light on his talent.

Talent: Rodriguez scored twice against Uruguay, claiming a preference to play for Real Madrid than Barcelona

Even though he penned a five-year contract with Monaco after moving to the Ligue 1 outfit last year for around £36million from Porto, there is likely to be sustained interest this summer.

Tottenham have previously passed up the opportunity to land Rodriguez, with the player not holding back in his desire to play in La Liga.

'I’d be a dream to play in Spain, one of the best leagues in the world,' he is said to have told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope.

When pressed whether he would prefer Barcelona, Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid, he replied: 'I like Madrid more.'

Unsurprising given his admiration for talisman Cristiano Ronaldo. The pair posed for a picture in 2012, with Rodriguez tweeting with the message: 'Here am I with the amazing Cristiano, RT if you like the picture. Hugs!'

Rodriguez netted twice against the Luis Suarez-less Uruguayans, with Colombia coach Jose Pekerman saying: 'I never had any doubts that this was going to be his World Cup, with opposite number Oscar Tabarez adding: 'From what I have seen, he is the best player in the World Cup,.

'I am not exaggerating, he is a great striker.'

Pick that one out! Fernando Muslera could do nothing about Rodriguez's stunning volley on Saturday
