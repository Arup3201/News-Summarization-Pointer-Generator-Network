Shaken: Billie Piper had her two young sons in the back of her VW Golf at the time of the collision

Billie Piper is being investigated by police after she was involved in a road accident with a 16-year-old cyclist who was taken to hospital with serious injuries, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The actress, best known for her starring roles in Doctor Who and The Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, was questioned by officers after colliding with the oncoming cycle, which slammed into her car at high speed.

The collision left Ms Piper, 31, so traumatised that she was forced to pull out of her leading part in a West End play. 

In dramatic circumstances she was apparently replaced by her understudy just 15 minutes before the curtain was due to go up that evening.

Scotland Yard confirmed an investigation is ongoing into the incident, which happened just before 4pm on Tuesday.

Ms Piper’s sons Winston, five, and Eugene, two, were in the back of her black Volkswagen Golf as she attempted a U-turn on a steep section of road behind King’s Cross station in the London borough of Camden. 

She is understood to have been driving at under five miles per hour as she crossed Goods Way into the path of the teenage cyclist who was travelling downhill at a significant speed.

The bike slammed into the back of the car and the boy was thrown to the ground. An eyewitness dialled 999.

Police quizzed Miss Piper at the roadside, while the teenager received treatment from the London Ambulance Service for a severe shoulder injury. 

He was then driven to nearby University College Hospital for further treatment. 

The Mail on Sunday understands that the cyclist was not wearing a helmet.

Ms Piper was not arrested and soon after went to the National Theatre on London’s South Bank, where she was due to appear that evening.

Backstage, she attempted to prepare for her performance in Great Britain – a critically acclaimed new satire on the media in which she stars as Paige Britain, editor of fictitious newspaper The Free Press. 

But she was still so shaken by the crash that it was decided her understudy, Jo Dockery, should replace her for that evening’s performance.

Theatregoers were told Ms Piper was ‘indisposed’ although no further explanation was given for her sudden absence, leading to much discussion on social media.

Ms Dockery, herself an award-winning actress, took to the stage and received rave reviews for her performance on Twitter.

One audience member tweeted: ‘Jo Dockery currently smashing it as Billie Piper in 3hr epic. She had 15 minutes notice.’

Ms Piper returned to the stage the following evening, while police continued their enquiries into the crash.

Officers must decide whether the actress’s driving was dangerous. 

The Crown Prosecution Service defines driving as dangerous when it falls below the ‘minimum acceptable standard expected of a competent and careful driver and when it would be obvious to a careful and competent driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.’

There is a fierce debate raging about the threat to cyclists on Britain’s roads.

This year, eight cyclists have lost their lives in accidents in London. 

The capital’s mayor Boris Johnson has recently pledged £1 billion to improve cycle safety.

But there were also calls last night for cyclists to take greater responsibility for their actions and to ensure they wear helmets.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were called to Goods Way, King’s Cross, by the London Ambulance Service at 15.56hrs on Tuesday, July 29 to reports of a road traffic collision between a motor vehicle and a cyclist. The driver of the vehicle was female. Enquiries continue. No further details at this stage.’

Charlie Lloyd of the London Cycling Campaign said: ‘When doing a U-turn you are expected to give way to everyone.

'Every crash highlights the need for all road users to take care. Wearing a cycle helmet is a personal choice – the evidence is mixed as to the protection they provide.’

A spokesman for Billie Piper declined to comment.
