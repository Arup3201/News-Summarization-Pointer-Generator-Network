Two grave-robbing sisters were today branded 'scumbags' as they appeared in court to be punished for stealing funeral wreaths.

Marion Hill, 42, and Lyndsay Millett, 37, were involved in a 'commercial enterprise' snatching wreaths to sell on from at least one cemetery, Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard.

They were caught on camera taking two wreaths just hours after they had been left by the grieving family of Bridget Jennat, 82, when she was buried the city's Allerton Cemetery.

Mrs Jennat's son Chris attended court today to see Hill and Millett sentenced.

Hill
was jailed for 10 weeks while Millett was given eight weeks jail 
suspended for 12 months after both were found guilty of theft at an 
earlier hearing.

Bereaved Chris Jennat attended Liverpool Magistrates' Court to see the callous pair sentenced

Mr Jennat, from Anfield, Liverpool, who discovered the wreaths had
been stolen, gave his reaction to the sentence outside court.

'I don’t think you could stoop any lower. They’re 
scumbags. There are no other words for them. They were doing this to 
sell them on,' he said.

'They were both doing it so both should have gone to jail for about six months.'

Andrew
Hodgson, prosecuting, told the court there had been a number of wreaths
and other items stolen from the cemetery, prompting Liverpool City 
Council to boost security by installing closed-circuit television 
cameras.

Merseyside Police checked the CCTV after the Jennat family reported the thefts.

At
8.55pm on May 7, the cameras caught Hill and Millett pulling up in a 
hired Land Rover Discovery, get out, pick up the wreaths, costing £90 
each, put them in the car and drive off, said Mr Hodgson.

Police
went to Hill’s home in Speke, south Liverpool, on May 16, and found 
wreaths, blank condolence cards, wreath stands and what Liverpool 
magistrates were told was 'wreath-making paraphernalia.'

A photo album packed with various pictures of floral tribute arrangements was also found.

The
two defendants claimed the wreaths were for their late mother’s grave, 
but magistrates rejected their defence at an earlier hearing - 
concluding they were running a business, selling on stolen wreaths.

Brazen: Hill seen in CCTV footage walking from a car towards the spot where the wreaths have been left

Callous: She makes straight for the wreaths left by Bridget Jennat's grieving family at her funeral that day

Leanne Kennedy, defending both women, said: 'They are both extremely ashamed of their actions.

'Since it has been reported in the press they themselves have been on the receiving end of threatening behaviour.

'This has been a lesson they will not forget.'

Ms
Kennedy said both had been sacked as play centre workers after the pair
were branded 'Tomb Raiders' in the local paper and Millett also evicted
from her home due to the 'backlash'.

Disrespectful: After snatching the floral memorials, Hill walks back the vehicle where her sister is waiting

Disgraceful: The pair stash the wreaths in the back of the rented Range Rover before driving away

District
Judge Richard Clancy said he made a distinction between the defendants 
and because Millett had no previous convictions she would be spared 
jail.

But Hill, who had previous convictions for dishonesty, would go to jail immediately.

He
told the pair: 'I have to say this is a most disgraceful offence and 
one that would not be tolerated by any civilised society.

'It’s a shameful and disgraceful thing.'

Both women were also ordered to pay £250 compensation.
