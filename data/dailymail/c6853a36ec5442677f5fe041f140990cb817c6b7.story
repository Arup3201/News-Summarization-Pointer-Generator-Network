Uwe Rosler has quickly emerged as one of the leading candidates for the Brighton job after Sami Hyypia resigned with the Seagulls stuck in the Championship’s relegation zone after a run of only one win in three months.

Rosler has been out of work since he was fired last month by Wigan, where he was in charge for less than a year.

He took them into the play-offs and the FA Cup semi-finals, where they lost on penalties against Arsenal, before he was sacked to make way for Malky Mackay.

The 46-year-old German joined Wigan from Brentford, his first managerial job in England, where he was responsible for much of the groundwork which led to their eventual promotion under Mark Warburton, who has maintained their eye-catching progress in the Championship.

Rosler’s managerial style and commitment to attractive, high-tempo football is understood to appeal to key individuals within the Brighton hierarchy.

Brighton chairman Tony Bloom tried to lure Tim Sherwood to the club before he appointed Hyypia in the summer and is expected to make another bid but the former Tottenham manager, out of work since he was fired at the end of last season, remains cool on the idea of dropping to the foot of the Championship.
