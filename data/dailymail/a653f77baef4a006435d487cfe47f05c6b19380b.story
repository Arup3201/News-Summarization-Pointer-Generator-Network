When Southampton waved goodbye to arguably their three best defenders in the summer, no-one would have predicted them becoming the clean sheet kings of the Barclays Premier League by December.

Yet the Saints go into Monday night’s match against Manchester United boasting the best defensive record in the English top flight.

Lose Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers? No problem, at least not so far, for Ronald Koeman’s team.

Nathaniel Clyne has been in fine form for Southampton this season under new boss Ronald Koeman

Fewest goals conceded in the top-flight this season (top five):

Southampton - 10 goals

Chelsea - 13 goals

Manchester City - 14 goals

Manchester United - 16 goals

Swansea City - 17 goals 

Southampton have conceded a measly 10 League goals, thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season.

Add the giant goalkeeping presence of Fraser Forster, plus pass-breaker Victor Wanyama in front of the defence, and that is one formidable hurdle.

Nathaniel Clyne, Jose Fonte and Ryan Bertrand have been ever-presents while Toby Alderweireld has played 10 matches.

Alderweireld is struggling to make the United game, which means a possible call for Maya Yoshida, who has not let anyone down either.

Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and/or Radamel Falcao may think that Southampton’s three-match run without a win means there might be easy pickings at St Mary’ s. Not if Saints can help it.

First Fonte. He has been part of the fixtures and fittings for a few years now and at the age of 30 provides a steady head for the younger players. The Portuguese reads the game and marshals his team-mates.

Toby Alderweireld is a doubt for Southampton's clash with United after picking up an injury against Arsenal

Clyne might have been forgiven for wondering what he had done wrong in the summer as Chambers and Shaw headed off to Arsenal and Manchester United.

Nothing at all, from Roy Hodgson’s point of view. Clyne, 23, is in the England coach’s plans thanks to his club performances. He has also chipped in with three goals, which is an unexpected and pleasant bonus.

Bertrand must love living out of a suitcase. The left back, on loan from Chelsea, is on his seventh temporary move and appears to find the south coast to his liking.

The 25-year-old had the misfortune of being at Stamford Bridge while a certain Ashley Cole was monopolising his position. No-one doubted Bertrand’s potential but he is finally getting the opportunity to prove himself a headline act.

So to Alderweireld, who is living up to his classy CV. The 25-year-old Belgian, brought up the Ajax way, has played in the Champions League final (for Atletico Madrid) and the World Cup in 2014, which makes the Premier League a less-daunting proposition.

He is on loan from Atleticoand doubtful for the United game with a thigh injury, which opens the door to Yoshida.

The Japanese defender made 13 appearances last season and this year has started four games in the Premier League. Yoshida, 26, may be an understudy but he knows what makes Southampton tick after joining from Venlo two years ago.

Southampton boss Koeman has hinted that he may promote a couple of his youngsters to the bench, too. Defender Jason McCarthy will be hoping that he gets a close-up view of the seniors.

The others in contention are midfielder Harry Reed and striker Ryan Seager as Saints continue to show their production line is still working at full pelt.
