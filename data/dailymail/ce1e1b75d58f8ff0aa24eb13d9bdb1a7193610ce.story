Alter ego: Grant Shapps poses as self-help guru Michael Green at a conference in Las Vegas in 2004

According to his name badge, he is Michael Green, a ‘multi-million-dollar web marketer’ posing at an internet conference in a Las Vegas casino.

But this is actually Tory chairman Grant Shapps, using an alter ego to promote his work as a leading self-help guru.

The former housing minister was pictured using a nom de plume while he was a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservatives. He was standing for the Welwyn Hatfield seat in Hertfordshire when he posed for the photo at a £2,000-a-head web marketing event at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in 2004.

Mr Shapps continued to use the name Michael Green for his business interests throughout the 2005 election campaign and his early years as an opposition MP. ‘Mr Green’ charged clients £183 an hour for advice on how to make money from the web as well as offering tips on how to beat the recession blues, including splashing out on a jet-ski or learning to play the guitar.

It is the latest embarrassing  revelation to hit Mr Shapps since he was promoted in David Cameron’s recent reshuffle, including his admission he had edited information on his own Wikipedia page.

Grant Shapps claimed he was born in London when he was running for a seat in the capital

Yesterday, it also emerged the MP apparently changed the description of where he was born depending on where he was standing for election. When he unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in 1997, in the South London seat of Southwark North and Bermondsey, his election leaflets described him as ‘a Londoner by birth’.

But since his successful 2005 campaign to win Welwyn Hatfield, his  literature has stated that he was ‘born in Hertfordshire’.

According to Mr Shapps’s Wikipedia profile, he was born in Watford.

Labour MP Steve McCabe said: ‘Grant Shapps increasingly appears to be a Walter Mitty character. His multiple personalities and questionable business practices are becoming a major embarrassment to the Tories.’

Mr Shapps has admitted using the name Michael Green to help him differentiate between his political and business activities.

Between 2004 and 2009, he ran  a website called MichaelGreen- Consulting.com, part of the company HowToCorp, created in 2000.

In 2008, he passed his share of the firm behind HowToCorp to his wife Belinda, who then took over the Michael Green pen name. Since then, he has had no involvement in it.

A Tory Party spokesman said: ‘Grant had a career in business before entering politics. He is completely open about this.’ He added that the description of Mr Shapps being born in London was a ‘genuine mistake’ and that the leaflets were later corrected.
