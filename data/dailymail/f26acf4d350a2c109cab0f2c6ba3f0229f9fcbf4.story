An incredible video has emerged showing the moment an elderly woman bravely confronted two Islamic State militants, telling them their terror group is cursed and that they are not back by God.

The video, which is believed to have been shot in Syria, shows the woman walks up to the fighters' car, brand them both 'devils' and tell them: 'I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God'.

Clearly shocked at being confronted, the men initially plead with the woman, telling her to explain what she means and asking if 'everything is good between us?'.

The woman chooses to ignore the men's attempts to justify ISIS' brutality, however, and instead attacks their bloodthirsty savagery and accuses them of 'killing each other like donkeys'.

Condemned: The video, which is believed to have been shot in Syria, shows the woman walks up to the fighters' car, brand them both 'devils' and tell them: 'I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God'

Becoming increasingly frustrated, the men eventually tell the woman they are busy and order her to go away

The video begins with the elderly woman walking up to the militants car and berate them for being members of the barbaric terrorist organisation.

Repeatedly urging them to 'turn back to God' she tells the fighters that ISIS is cursed and that neither they nor Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime will emerge from the bloodshed victorious.

The men initially respond to her berating them by asking her what has prompted her attack. They then try to justify their actions by telling her of their recent prayer sessions.

The woman, who wears traditional Arabian clothing, ignores the men and continues her attack, swearing at them at insisting that ISIS' brutality is 'making us go backwards'.

Becoming increasingly frustrated, the men change their tone and begin telling the woman they are busy and she should go away. They then resort to mockery when she begins reciting verses from the Koran that warn against fighting and slaughter when it is possible to make peace.

'You don't want this slaughtering, nor do you want this murder,' she says, prompting one of the militants to chillingly reply: ' We have come to you with slaughter'.

Throughout the video the woman's face twists in fury as she demands they stop killing people.

'Do not slaughter anyone and nobody will slaughter you. It's all forbidden. I swear nothing you have done was in the way of God,' she says.

'God is watching what you are doing. 'Those who deny our verses and are arrogant towards them, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter paradise,' she adds.

The video then comes to an end without showing what became of the brave elderly woman.

Yesterday Jordanian air force jets bombed ISIS hideouts in Syria, state television said, resuming the intensified raids that ended at the weekend after three days.

The raids are the first the Jordanian military have announced since three straight days of aerial bombing - in retaliation for the killing of a pilot - that ended on Saturday. Mouath al-Kasaesbeh was burned to death by Islamic State militants two weeks ago.

'The airforce has bombed and destroyed select targets of the Daesh criminal gang this afternoon,' it said. 'Daesh' is a derogative Arabic term for the militants. 

Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to 'let him go' and 'get on with their lives' - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series.

In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release.

However, he adds: 'Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you'.

Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: 'That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on.

'What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.'

In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that 'every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State'.

Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' 

The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian's shocking murder.

There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley.

Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS.
