Respectable facade: Erika Murray's home is guarded by a Blackstone police officer in September after a three-year-old girl and a five-month-old girl were found in the home along with three dead infants

The woman’s attorney, Keith Halpern, said last month that she appears to have mental health issues.

Health department employees took hundreds of pictures inside the home prior to its demolition, which show an unimaginable clutter, with mounds of refuse mixed in with old beat-up furniture, discarded electronic equipment, empty soda cans and food wrappings, dog feces everywhere and soiled diapers.

Investigators in full hazmat suits and respirators spent several days documenting the deplorable conditions inside the squalid house that four young children, between the ages of 6 months and 13 years, had called home. 

Health officials also found the filthy, stench-filled dwelling crawling with rats and insects.

It took clean-up crews 90 hours spread over four days of work to clear out Murray's house before heavy machinery was brought in to raze it to the ground.

The clean-up and demolition cost the City of Blacktone just under $30,000. 

Accused: Erika Murray, pictured in court last week, told cops that one of the children found dead in her home had lived for several days before she found it dead. The remains of two other babies were also found

Erika Murray's four children were removed from the house in August.

Authorities found the remains of the woman's three infant children in a more thorough search a few weeks later. Two of them were entirely skeletal. 

The corpses were discovered dressed in diapers and onesies, and hanging in bags in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm, reported NECN.

Her four surviving kids were rescued August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in his own feces.

Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds.

In court in October, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back. 

On Wednesday, it was announced that Erika Murray's next court appearance has been delayed until January 2015 pending the state medical examiner's report on the remains of her  babies, MassLive.com reported.

The house was owned by Kristina Rivera of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the sister of Murray's boyfriend, Raymond Rivera.  

Raymond Rivera, who lived in the basement, has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he grew marijuana in the basement. So far, he has not been charges in connection to the dead babies.
