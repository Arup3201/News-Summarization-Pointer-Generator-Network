A Maryland man who was convicted of sexually assaulting men he met beer pong tournaments is said to have had at least 30 victims.

Joey Poindexter, 40, from Gaithersburg, was convicted of luring men to his home to abuse them before taking photographs while they were incapacitated.

Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting five men earlier this year.

Prosecutors, who originally believed there were only a few victims, now say that he preyed on dozens of young men for 10 years and have asked for a 200-year sentence.

The case against Poindexter (pictured) did not begin to build until 2013, when a student alleged the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a bar during a tournament for the popular drinking game

Prosecutors said after Poindexter, 'confirmed they were helpless, he violated them sexually in every way imaginable, and often recorded it as keepsake.'

Poindexter's lawyer, who is new to the case, was granted a continuance after new evidence was presented during the sentencing process, according to CBS 12.  

It wasn't until 2013 that allegations first emerged, when a student claimed the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a bar during a tournament for the popular drinking game.

The student  didn't remember anything when he woke up in Poindexter's home the next morning and went to the police, who asked him to call the man and record the conversation, according to NBC Washington. 

Poindexter was reluctant to admit anything over the phone, telling the victim 'no matter what did or didn't happen, like I said, I was pretty trashed'. 

'If it makes you feel any better, I don’t have any [expletive] AIDS, if anything did happen.'

But when Poindexter met with the victim, who was wearing a wire,  he admitted they had sex while the student was intoxicated but said it was consensual.

The student told police Poindexter had bought him beer, shots and a Long Island Ice Tea the night they met.  

Surveillance images (pictured) from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand while Poindexter led him out the door. His case has been given a continuance because of new evidence

Surveillance images from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand up as Poindexter led him out the door on the night of the assault, according to the Washington Post.

And police found a video Poindexter had recorded that night of the two in his shower - which was later shown in court - on his phone. 

One anonymous juror said it 'seemed pretty clear' that Poindexter had been 'in a predatory state'.

The college student's case was just the beginning. Police found pictures of a number of men 'in various states of consciousness' on Poindexter's cell phone. 

And they identified at least 12 other victims from photographs that were stored on his hard drive. 

Mayland authorities have also contacted police in Las Vegas, Dallas, Atlantic City, Salt Lake City and Virginia Beach, where Poindexter attended beer pong and skateboarding events. 

Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's Gaithersburg, Maryland, home while drunk

Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions around the country in addition to skateboarding events

Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's home while drunk.

Officers said all three victims had been drunk, and possibly drugged.

Three of the fourmen Poindexter was convicted of assaulting testified against him, sometimes answering questions from their alleged abuser acted as his own lawyer.

Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting a fifth man in January.

Juror Jennifer Davis said the jury were 'disgusted to know that someone of that age' would prey on young adults.  

Police have urged other potential victims to come forward and contact the Montgomery County Special Victims Unit.
