Police may have missed a golden opportunity to save kidnapped Abigail Hernandez when they went to the small trailer where Nathaniel Kibby was allegedly holding her captive, five months after she disappeared.

Kibby was ordered to hand over his vast arsenal of guns after he was arrested at the start of March and charged with simple assault, criminal trespass and loitering or prowling.

Incredibly the loner, who has been described as a 'gun nut' by neighbors, actually called police and invited them to his home in Gorham, New Hampshire to seize his weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions.

An officer carries ammunition boxes from the home of Kibby on Friday. It was revealed that police had visited Kibby's home in March to retrieve guns - perhaps missing an opportunity to save the teenage girl that he is believed to have held captive

Official records show two officers went round to his property at 9.04pm on March 2013, stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns.

Their visit raises serious questions as it is believed Abby Hernandez, now 15, was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her October disappearance.

This has been backed up by the fact investigators have focused all their search efforts on Kibby's trailer, a storage container in his backyard and a small stretch of river that runs at the back of his property. At this stage it is believed this is the only place he could have kept Abigail.

Yesterday the Attorney General's office refused to comment on the incident, but if Abigail was being held just yards away, while officers were inside Kibby's trailer, their visit will come under serious scrutiny.

Some friends and neighbors have already questioned why Kibby, who has an extensive criminal record and used to work just a couple of miles from where Abby went missing, wasn't already on the police radar.

Kibby, was known as, 'Crazy Nate' around the trailer park and neighbors have described him as a 'creepy, gun-obsessed, odd-ball', who always talked about conspiracy theories and the zombie apocalypse.

One resident, who refused to be named, said a female relative of his visited Gorham Police this week to make a formal complaint against Kibby after he apparently kept her held in his trailer against her will for more than an hour.

The incident apparently happened back in February, but the woman, in her early twenties was too scared to report it. The relative told MailOnline: 'Apparently he had her in there for about an hour and wouldn't let her leave.

'I wish she'd told us at the time, because maybe we could have done something about it. We felt it was important to tell the police now so they have every possible piece of information.' 

Again the Attorney-General's office refused to comment on the complaint.

Glen Alden, who lives in the trailer opposite Kibby, remembers March's police visit. He describes the 34-year-old suspect as, 'off-kilter', but finds it hard to believe he had Abigail held captive in his trailer or the container for nine months.

He said: 'He was a strange guy, but I just don't see how it's possible. Someone would have seen or heard something. There was a girl in her 20's who used to visit him on weekends and the police were in there.'

However one former classmate Randy Waldron, is not at all surprised by Kibby's arrest. He claims he was tormented by Kibby throughout his school years and describes Kibby as rotten to the core.

They first met in sixth grade. MailOnline has obtained an exclusive yearbook picture of an angelic looking Kibby from that year, aged 12.

Alongside the photo he says he has one brother and his interests include, 'collecting stamps and talking to his friends'. In 20 years he says he will be an, 'MIT graduate just getting out of the Air Force as an engineer'.

But that sweet image is a million miles away from the boy Randy Waldron remembers.

Talking to The Conway Daily Sun, he said: 'I hope Abby gets word that she's not alone; there are more of us who were tortured by Nat Kibby. I'm really shocked no one could connect this to him sooner.'

Describing the moment he heard Kibby had been arrested in connection with Abigail's kidnapping, he said: 'I immediately called my mom (Nancy) who was on vacation on the Cape and told her an arrest had been made in the Abigail Hernandez case.

'I said, 'I'll give you three guesses who did it.' The first words out of her mouth were Nat Kibby. He tortured me and my mom for years.'

Another former classmate, Brian Duhamel, says he remembers Kibby as a loner who always got in trouble, but not a bully.

He said: 'I don't think he was a bully, but from very young, you could see he had the potential to go down the wrong path. I was in classes with him all the way from elementary school, right the way up to Kennett High School.

New Hampshire State Police officers speak outside the home of Nathaniel Kibby at the trailer park on Friday. Questions have been raised as to why Kibby, who worked a few miles from where Abby disappeared, had not been found sooner

'There were a few incidents that stand out. I remember him having huge fights with some of the teachers, where he would scream and shout at them.

SAU 9 superintendent Carl Nelson, who started in the district in July of 1998, told The Conway Daily Sun he was 'quite familiar' with Kibby.

He also said 1998 was 'the year of all the bomb threats', but he couldn't say for sure whether Kibby was involved.

And in February of that year, Kibby was arrested after he bought an AK-47 type weapon and ammunition from K-Mart, using a fake ID.

Brian Duhamel says he doesn't know why Kibby behaved the way he did, but always assumed it may have been down to problems at home.

Very little is known about the suspect's family life. From arrest reports it can be seen he lived with his father Wayne Kibby and his year book references a brother.

The North Conway home the family lived in was owned by Wayne's sister. One parent who had a child at Kennett High School, said: 'I really didn't know his father and I very rarely saw him at school functions or anything like that. It's strange because this is a small place and everyone usually knows everyone else.'

Kibby is currently being held on $1 million bail after his arraignment on Tuesday. He is accused of kidnapping Abigail Hernandez last October as she walked home from school, just days before her 15th birthday. He then apparently held her captive for nine months, before she mysteriously returned home on Sunday July 20.

Since his arrest on Monday FBI agents, State Troopers and local police have been conducting a rigorous search of his trailer and the shipping container in his back yard.

It is believed he may have held her in the container, which is apparently sound proofed and has three rooms. Yesterday a K-9 unit was brought in for the first time to search a river back behind the property.
