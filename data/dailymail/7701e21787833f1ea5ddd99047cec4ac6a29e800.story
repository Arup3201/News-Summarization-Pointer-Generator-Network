You have the card, the flowers and the champagne – now all you need is the right music.

And just in time for Valentine's Day, Spotify has released a list of the best songs to listen to when making love.

After looking through the 2.5 million playlists, the music streaming service identified 'Intro' by The xx as the most popular to listen to during sex.

Other songs in the top ten are also slow tempo, largely stripped down tracks by Indie bands and include 'From Eden' by Hozier and Coldplay's 'Magic'.

Electronic musicians also feature heavily, including 'Talk is Cheap' by Chet Faker and 'You and me' by Disclosure. 

The study found that sex playlists are more often created by men, who make up 56 per cent of the 2.5 million on the service.

Spotify also looked for the most popular songs featured in 'love' playlists, of which there are 28 million.

Angela Watts, VP Global Communications, Spotify said, 'With data from our 60 million users, we're predicting what the world will be listening to on Valentine's Day.

'Not only did we discover that John Legend takes the top spot on love playlists, we also found that most Valentine's Day playlists on Spotify were created by men.'

Previous research has found that listening to new music can boost the brain and give it a chemical 'reward' similar to sex.

Using MRI scans, Canadian scientists found that areas in the reward centre of the brain - the same part activated when we have sex or eat our favourite foods - became active when people heard a song for the first time.

The more the listener enjoyed what they were hearing, the stronger the connections were.

'When people listen to a piece of music they have never heard before, activity in one brain region can reliably and consistently predict whether they will like or buy it,' said researcher Valorie Salimpoor of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. 

'This is the nucleus accumbens which is involved in forming expectations that may be rewarding.'
