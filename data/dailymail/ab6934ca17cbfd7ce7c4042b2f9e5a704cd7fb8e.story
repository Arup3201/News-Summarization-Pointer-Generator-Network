Only £6.99: The Philippe Michel Cremant Du Jura at Aldi came top of a list compiled by wine experts

A £6.99 bottle of budget wine has been named Britain’s ‘best value’ bubbly for New Year’s Eve.

The 750ml Philippe Michel Cremant Du Jura available at Aldi came top of a list compiled by wine experts who tasted more than 200 brands currently available in supermarkets.

In second place was a £29.99 bottle of Louis Roederer Brut Premier NV Champagne at Waitrose, while Sainsbury's Champagne Blanc de Noirs Brut NV at £16.49 came in third.

The Aldi wine is said to be ‘perfect for any occasion, with hints of apple and lemon citrus’ and ‘fantastically crisp and elegant with green apples, perfect acidity and persistent bubbles’.

The French offering was acknowledged in a survey by wine app Wotwine and has also been described by national newspapers as ‘currently the best value sparkler in Britain’ and ‘very drinkable and a total bargain’.

The Louis Roederer bottle was described as ‘consistently rated as one of the finest non-vintage champagnes’ and comes from a family-owned Champagne house established in the 19th century.

The Blanc de Noirs translates as 'whites of blacks' and is made with a blend of two black varieties: Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Sainsbury's calls it a ‘rich, creamy wine with elegant red-fruit flavours’.

Wotwine was launched this month and tells consumers if a wine is worth more or less than its shelf price. It claims to have Britain’s most comprehensive database of supermarket wine.

Wotwine co-founder Henry Shelford told the Daily Express: ‘There are some fantastic bargains to be had over the festive period.’

The free app works by scanning a bottle's barcode, and then tells consumers at how much it would value the wine – a figure which can then be compared to the shelf price.

Following Wotwine's launch, Mr Shelford said: ‘When you line up a category of wines from across the supermarkets, the differences between bottles becomes stark. For the same money you can buy bad wines - or spectacular wines.’
