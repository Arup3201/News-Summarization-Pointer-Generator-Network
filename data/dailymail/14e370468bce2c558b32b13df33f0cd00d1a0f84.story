An architect and her teenage son were tragically killed in front of her two other boys when their car crashed into a tractor during a half-term day trip.

Kate Boughton and her eldest son Sam, 14, were killed instantly when their Vauxhall Corsa careered into a tractor near Leominster, Herefordshire, on Valentine's Day.

Mrs Boughton's two younger sons were also trapped in the car when it crashed on Tuesday morning, with one today stable and the other still critical in hospital.

Tragedy: Kate Boughton and her 14-year-old son Sam (right) were both killed when their Vauxhall Corsa collided with a tractor driving in the opposite direction

A team of 20 firefighters using hydraulic cutting equipment spent an hour releasing the family from the wreckage.

Neil Pigott, of Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'We had four casualties trapped in a severely damaged vehicle.

'The extent of the damage and the position of the vehicle meant we were going to have to free those casualties one by one.'

Kate, 35, was airlifted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but died of massive head injuries a short time later.

Scene: The family had been on a half term trip on Valentine's Day when tragedy struck near Leominster, Worcestershire

Her two younger sons, who were strapped in the back seat were airlifted to Birmingham Childrenâ€™s Hospital with serious injuries.

The family had just set off from their home in Combe, near Presteigne, Herefordshire, for a day out when they hit a tractor coming in the opposite direction.

The tractor driver, who has not been named, was uninjured in the crash.

Treatment: Mrs Boguhton's two younger sons were both rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital after the crash, where one is stable and the other remains in a critical condition

Today as tributes poured in for the tragic mother and son, one of their neighbours told how, 'you could not want for a happier family'.

Mrs Boughton was a director of architectural and engineering consultancy firm Penguin Services UK Ltd with her husband Edward, 41.

He was understood to be working from the family home at the time of the crash.

An inquest into their deaths is expected to be opened and adjourned today (Fri) in Hereford.
