Gerard Pique took to Twitter to post a photograph of the Barcelona star and his popstar wife Shakira enjoying a dinner date.

The defender, who declared his intention to stay at the Catalan club for the rest of his career, treated the Colombian singer to a meal - just over a week since the birth of their daughter Sasha. 

Pique tweeted 'Enjoying the Yourburg the best food in Barcelona with Shakira!' and a picture of the couple.

The ex-Manchester United player scored in Barcelona's 3-1 over Villarreal in the Copa del Rey and has been an ever-present figure in the side.

It was the defenders fifth goal of the season in all competitions and he's already bettered his previous ever tally. 

With Barcelona closing the gap on rivals Real Madrid to just a point, Pique and his teammates there's no room for any errors.
