Mourinho tells Sky Sports: They did a fantastic match. This team is very mature and very confident. To win 5-0 away in Germany is not normal but it was very impressive.

87mins: Drogba almost latches on to a Ramires pass but Fahrmann rushes out to steel the ball way. 'Ole, Ole Ole, Chelsea Chelsea' sing the travelling fans. 

Drogba turns provider as he finds space on the left and chips the ball towards the back post for Ramires to head home. 

The man who won Chelsea the Champions League in 2012, has his fourth goal of the campaign after tapping home to end a brilliant Chelsea move.

75mins: Another change for Chelsea as Oscar is replaced by fellow Brazilian Ramires.

66mins: Change for Chelsea as Costa is given a rest and replaced by Drogba. Costa has been a constant threat but will be frustrated not to have scored his first Champions League goal in a Chelsea shirt.

Matt Barlow: Diego Costa is furious with himself for missing the chance for Chelsea’s fourth. He was still cursing minutes later and probably did not need Willian chipping in with his opinion. Costa still waiting for his first CL goal for Chelsea. We’ll let him off.

63mins: Meyer replaces Boateng. 

57mins: Costa keeps finding promising positions out on the left but Hoger has stuck to the Spanish striker reasonably well. Fabregas is dictating just how much effort Chelsea put into this second half.  

Matt Barlow: Di Matteo has switched Schalke to 442 for the second half with Clemens on for Kirchhoff and Choupo-Moting, perhaps their best player in the first half, sent up front with Huntelaar. It has made little impact. Chelsea look capable of scoring as many as they choose to score.

51mins: Terrific plays from Chelsea - Fabregas plays a long ball over to top to Costa who sees yet another shot block. The ball falls to Hazard and he jinks towards the byline only to see a cross cleared. 

47mins: Costa says it's my turn now as he bullies Santana off the ball and drives into the box before the Schalke defender is able to get a foot in a clear the ball for a corner. 

Can the home side mount a comeback? It looks extremely unlikely... The Chelsea players look to be really enjoying their football at the moment.

Matt Barlow: Schalke booed and whistled off at half-time.

It's a shocker for Schalke, who trail by three goals after a stunning first 45 minutes from Mourinho's side. 

Absolute disaster for Schalke. Fabregas swings in a corner, Santana gets in Kirchoff's way and between them manage to smash the ball into their own net. That's Chelsea through, surely.

Matt Barlow: Schalke fans are turning on their team here, whistling at their slow and listless football. Atmosphere on the turn. Feels like White Hart Lane.

He's done it! Messi is now the all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League with 72. 

Chelsea double their lead as Willian rifles a low drive past Fahrmann. The build-up from Mourinho's side was magnificent as Hazard and Oscar interchanged brilliantly.

Suarez has his first goal in a Barca shirt and what a goal it was. The former Liverpool man found space on the left side of the box before changing his body shape and curling the ball into the net with his right foot. Judging by his celebrations, the Uruguayan enjoyed that one.

26mins: Boateng drifts a promising free-kick straight into the arms of Courtois. Blues still in total control here as Boateng loses possession once again. 

22mins: Schalke are slowly starting to get a foothold on the game after a brilliant start from Chelsea.

The Blues look so dangerous on the counter-attack, however, as Hazard links well with Hazard before seeing his shot blocked by Santana.

18mins: Hoger is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Hazard. 

Matt Barlow: Chelsea fans singing 'One di Matteo' in the 16th minute. Nice touch. They’re being a bit drowned out by the Schalke drummers. RDM gives a thumbs up.

12mins: Schalke hit the crossbar as Choupo-Moting's shot deflects and loops over the head of Courtois.

9mins: Matic intercepts a pass in the centre before driving forwards and feeding an offside Costa. 

Shortly afterwards, Costa drives down the left, beats a man but his cut back is cleared =. 

5mins: Chelsea come close to taking a 2-0 lead, but Ivanovic snatches at a volley from the centre of Schalke's penalty area. The Blues have been dominant during the early stages. 

Chelsea have an early lead and it's the captain with a trademark header from a Fabregas corner (another assist for the Spaniard).

Terry jumped higher than his man at the far post to guide a header into the back of the net.

Perfect start for Mourinho's men. 

We're underway in Schalke as the home side start with the ball. 

Matt Barlow: Jose Mourinho waits by the end of the tunnel to greet RDM before kick-off but the Schalke boss kept him waiting. They exchange the briefest of handshakes before heading to the benches.

Matt Barlow: First chorus of 'One Di Matteo' heard from the Chelsea fans, penned in one corner of the Veltins Arena. More than 2,000 were expected from London. Certainly not that many in their seats at the moment. 10 mins to KO in Gelsenkirchen.

Matt Barlow: Touchline hugs from Di Matteo for members of the Chelsea medical team after he completes a pre-match TV interview, but the Schalke boss is looking to play this low-key. Players are all out for warm-up. Chelsea in yellow tonight.

Good to see Schalke seem to be in traditional blue & white, rather than that ridiculous green kit they like to wear in the Champions League.

Courtois, speaking to Sky Sports, had a cheeky message for his colleague Mark Schwarzer, who is currently sitting in the Sky Sports studios.

He joked: 'Sometimes I will complain about some pain in my foot or something and then I look at Mark and he's 42 so I can't complain!'

Matt Barlow: The Veltins Arena is rocking out to a bit of Status Quo as the Schalke team emerge for their warm-up. It is one of the most atmospheric new areas in European football.

The roof is open at the moment, but the locals can generate tremendous noise here. Chelsea – not a club familiar with the concept of the status quo – will be out to silence the place as they did last year with a 3-0 win

The Barcelona forward, who faces APOEL in Cyprus tonight, is currently tied with Real Madrid legend Raul on 71 goals, with Cristiano Ronaldo one behind.

And Messi will be confident of breaking the record after scoring a hat-trick against Sevilla on Saturday which helped set a new La Liga goalscoring record of 253 goals.

MATT BARLOW: Listen out in the 16th minute of Chelsea’s game against Schalke tonight and amid the usual din of the Veltins Arena there may be a ripple of applause and a chorus of 'One Di Matteo'.

Chelsea supporters treat their legends with respect. Remember how they sang for Frank Lampard at Manchester City, even after he had scored a late equaliser against them.

The 16th minute ovation in honour of Roberto Di Matteo’s shirt number became a staple of Chelsea games after he had been fired to make way for Rafa Benitez... Click on the link above to read more.
