A university professor who stabbed his wife to death wrote 'Kill Kathie Kill Kathie Kill Kathie!!!!!' on a to-do list before murdering her, it has emerged.

Jean-Pierre Trias wrote the grisly message on a list of daily chores that was saved in a computer file recovered by police, according to a wrongful death suit filed by the sisters of victim Katherine Porter.

The suit, which was filed in Washtenaw County Trial Court, says that the note shows premeditation in Porter's murder. She was found dead at their home with two knives still in her body on January 11.

Trias, 44, who worked as a tutor at Eastern Michigan University, has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and has been sentenced to 30 to 36 years in prison.

Police have never revealed a motive for the murder. The couple, who were married 17 years, had previously filed for divorce but reconciled and there was no record of domestic abuse at the home.

Porter's sisters, Martha and Sarah Porter, are seeking an unspecified amount of money for one count of assault and one count of wrongful death due to battery, AnnArbor.com reported.

It will be at least $25,000, which is the minimum amount to get the case into the circuit court.

Trias inherited more than a million dollars and property and the Porters' lawyer has secured a temporary freeze on his assets until the hearing so that he or his family cannot spend it.

Scene: The two knives were still sticking in her when she was found dead at the couple's home in January

The suit says he is the grandson 
of Jose Trias Monge who 'served as an architect of the Puerto Rican 
constitution', the country's attorney general and the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court.

Trias'
father, Peter Trias Grimes, was also involved in Puerto Rican affairs 
and left Trias 'a substantial amount of money' on his death.

The money would have been Porter's had her husband died before her, the suit notes.

Trias worked at Eastern Michigan University as a part-time coordinator of math tutoring and a graduate assistant until December 2012.

He admitted stabbing his wife 
numerous times with two knives, which were found in her body when police
officers carried out a welfare check on the home the day after the 
murder.

It has never been reported how many stab wounds she suffered, but she also had numerous cuts and bite marks to her body, the medical examiners noted.

Trias also suffered injuries, including wounds to his face that appear to have been caused by fingernail scratches. These large cuts can be seen in his mug shot.

At his hearing, there was no testimony 
describing what happened in the moments before her death and nothing 
revealing a possible motive for the killing.

The couple married in August 1995 and Trias once filed for divorce but they reconciled. They did not have any children.
