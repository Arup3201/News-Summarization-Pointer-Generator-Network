The sister of a young man who was brutally murdered in a racist attack has paid her own tribute to her brother by joining the police force that caught his killers.

Nearly seven years after her brother Anthony Walker, 18, was cut down with an ice-axe in Liverpool, Dominique Walker, 26, has been sworn in as a police constable with Merseyside Police.

Speaking of her decision, she said: 'I want to do some good for ­society.

'If I can bear witness 
to Anthony’s life by wearing this uniform and doing this job, it means 
he did not die in vain.'

Tribute: Dominique Walker says tha by joining the police, her brother Anthony's death will not have been in vain

Student Anthony Walker has been walking across a park with his white girlfriend Louise Thompson and his cousin Marcus Binns when he was set upon and murdered in July 2005.

Following an investigation by Merseyside Police, two suspects – Michael Barton, half-brother of QPR footballer Joey, and his cousin Paul Taylor – were brought before the courts.

They are now behind bars serving life for the murder.

Following the murder, Miss Walker went to the park alongside Mr Binns to try to find out who had killed her brother.

A girl provided them with two names, which Miss Walker then presented to the police.

It was an important moment for her, as she told the Sunday Mirror.

'After the ­murder I came into contact with a lot of senior 
officers who inspired me with their dignity and determination to do the 
right thing,' she said.

'All the police we dealt with were very kind and 
caring.

'They became almost like members of the extended family.

'I 
realised these were people I could admire and aspire to emulate and it 
was then that the seeds of the idea were planted in me.'

Miss Walker also told the newspaper that she enjoyed being a police officer.

'I like the elements of the job that involve helping people when they are in difficulty," she said.

Her ambition is to become Britain's first black female chief constable.

Mike Fuller became the country's first black chief constable when he was appointed to the top post in Kent in 2003.
