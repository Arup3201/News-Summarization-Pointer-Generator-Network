The men accused of killing a New Jersey man in front of his terrified wife during a carjacking at an upscale mall drove to the alleged crime in a car owned by the mother of one of the suspects, court papers say.

Hanif Thompson, 29, Karif Ford, 31, Basim Henry, 32, and Kevin Roberts, 33, drove to The Mall at Short Hills on Dec. 15 in Henry's mother's Subaru SUV, which helped investigators track down the suspects.

New court documents released Monday say the four were caught on surveillance video arriving at the scene in the car and targeted Dustin Friedland, 30, for his car, which was a dark silver Range Rover.

After the suspects shot Friedland in the head and took his Range Rover, two of the men fled in that car while the other two left in the original car owned by Henry's mother, according to NBC New York.

The other three were arrested in Newark and Irvington.

'It was the car, not the person, that appears to be the target of this crime,' said Carolyn Murray, acting Essex County prosecutor.

The gun used to kill Friedland has not been recovered.

Bail for each of the suspects is set at $2 million, and all four are charged with murder, felony murder, carjacking, conspiracy, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose.

They are expected to be arraigned Jan. 8.

Mr
 Friedland was a 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken.

It is believed that he had refused to hand over his keys.

The assailants drove off in his silver Range Rover, which was found the next morning in Newark, about 10 miles from Short Hills.

The shooting took place as Mr Friedland and his wife, Jamie Schare Friedland, were ending a shopping trip.

Mourners at his funeral on Wednesday said he had just opened the door of his SUV for his wife when he was shot.

At his funeral, his 27-year-widow said: ‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

'He wasn't here [with us] long enough, but he did so much while he was,' she said. 'I was lucky to be with him for his forever.'

The couple met while studying at Syracuse University. Mr Friedland gained a law degree and worked as a project manager for his family's heat and air conditioning company.

They married in 2011 and had dreamed of starting a family together.
