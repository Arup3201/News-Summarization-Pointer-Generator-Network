If England spent much of their pre-match World Cup obsessing about the centre forward they may or may not face in Sao Paulo on Thursday, all of a sudden there is another goalscorer looming on the horizon with something to prove.

Luis Suarez and Uruguay were always expected to provide Roy Hodgson’s team with something of a test this summer. Providing Suarez proves his fitness, England will deal with that particular obstacle on Thursday.

Around the corner, however, await Costa Rica and their young striker Joel Campbell.

Opening his account: Campbell helped Costa Rica cause a World Cup shock

A goal from the 20-year-old Arsenal forward helped Costa Rica shock Uruguay with a 3-1 win in Fortaleza on Saturday and those closest to him have predicted more of the same when the central American nation meet England in Belo Horizonte next week.

Campbell’s father Humberto told Sportsmail: 'I expect and want to make it known that I have told him this has to be the game for him.

'When he played against Manchester United [for Olympiakos in the Champions League last season] I told him that it had to be the game to shine, to show the world what he can do.

'He has the football to show in England and this is the time for him to prove it to everybody. I have told him this and that is what he is going to do. What he did against Uruguay, it was incredible.

'I knew he was going to score or do something exceptional, like he did for the third goal. I expected that. I knew it would happen.'

Campbell has been an Arsenal player for three years but has spent all of that time out on loan, first at Real Betis in Spain and then in Greece with Olympiakos.

Having scored the second goal in Olympiakos’s defeat of United in Athens last season, the 20-year-old made a small dent on the public consciousness back in England.

His performance in Brazil at the weekend, though, left an even greater mark and it appears that the young footballer will not lack confidence against Italy in Recife on Friday or indeed against the country where he hopes to make his living next season.

'When he was young I used to work away a lot on cruise ships,' revealed Campbell senior.

'When I came back I brought videos of Pele and Maradona with me to show him. We sat on the bed and I showed him the videos of their best moments.

'When I showed him one piece of skill from Maradona, he said: "Pop, where did he get that from? I invented that".

'I told him that was impossible but he took me out on the porch and he showed me the trick. I knew then that I had a little Maradona on my hands.

'When he was smaller, I was always taking him up and down to football school. When he was five I took him to one school and the guy said he couldn’t take him as he was too young.

So I told him he was seven and they put him in the team. He was actually only five and one of the smallest in the team but he was the best. All the time he was like that. Playing with older guys.

'I always thought when he was growing up that he would be a great player. I just tried to support him and give him all he needs. He is looking forward to going to the Premier League.'

Campbell’s loan with Olympiakos is now up and he is due to report back to Arsenal for pre-season.

His club 
manager Arsene Wenger is in Brazil working for French TV and will be 
aware of the impact his player could be about to have on the World Cup.

'Hopefully he can see what Joel can do,' said Campbell Snr. 'If they bring him back home to Arsenal I will be very happy.

'If they don’t then wherever they send him he just has to go and keep his feet on the ground.

'He has always been good enough. He just needs them to give him the chance. I always had it in mind that Arsene knows what is best for young ones. He always makes good players.

'Unfortunately he didn’t want to play Joel when he was 18 but maybe he will when he is 21.'

Campbell Snr is travelling around Brazil with his wife Roxanne and believes the party that has already started in Costa Rica is about to get bigger.  

Certainly the Group D underdogs have a real chance of making progress now that they have three points from their first game.

'Everybody back at home is very excited,' he added.

'I said beforehand that we would beat Uruguay, draw with Italy and beat England. That is still what I feel. That is what I said.

'The win on Saturday didn’t surprise me. I told my son that. I am not sure he believed me.

Danger: England need to be wary of Campbell

'If we come out with the personality I know the team has then I know they can damage England. Sometimes if you think too much it can cause trouble.

'I know England are not better than us and if they are confident to just go and show what they can do they will beat England.

'My country is a small country – just a few million – and people pretty much ignore us. But if my son was Brazilian, for example, he would be famous around the world.'
