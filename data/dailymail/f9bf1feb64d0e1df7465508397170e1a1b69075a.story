Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has laid the blame of his failure to deliver the Champions League for Real Madrid at the feet of Cristiano Ronaldo.

The Portuguese duo spent three years at the Santiago Bernabeu together from 2010 to 2013 before Mourinho left for Stamford Bridge.

Real came closest to winning Europe's premier club competition in 2012 when they were eliminated on penalties by eventual runners-up Bayern Munich.

Ronaldo - who won his second Ballon d'Or in January - took Real's first spot-kick and missed it, before Kaka and Sergio Ramos also failed to score.

'Winning the Champions twice as coach has made my career a special one,' Mourinho, who lifted the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan, told TVI24.

'I've been in several semi-finals too and some defeats were especially hard to take, such as the goal that did not exist against Liverpool [during his first Chelsea spell in 2005 or on penalties in 2012 when our first-choice penalty taker [Ronaldo] went up first and failed.'

Bayern went on to lose the final to Chelsea that year. Ronaldo won his second Champions League trophy with Real Madrid in May, having also done so with Manchester United in 2008.
