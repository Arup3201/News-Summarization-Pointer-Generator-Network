Twenty-one people were evacuated today when a fire engulfed a restaurant and a number of flats.

Firefighters were called to tackle the blaze at a three-storey building on St James Way in Sidcup, Kent, which damaged the ground floor and part of the first floor.

London Fire Brigade said that the building's ground floor was completely gutted and the second floor had also been severely damaged before the fire was brought under control by 6:20am after two hours.

The building was believed to include a restaurant on the ground floor with flats on two floors above it.

Eight fire engines at the scene used three jets to tackle the blaze, and around 40 firefighters attended, with some using thermal imaging cameras.

Officers from Plumstead, Erith, Bexley, Eltham, Sidcup, Bromley, and Orpington fire stations were all at the scene, the LFB said.

The cause of the fire is now under investigation. Everyone who was inside the building has since been accounted for and there were no injuries.

An LFB spokesman said on Twitter just after 6:30am: 'The fire in St
James Way in Sidcup is now under control. Crews will remain at the scene for
some time to dampen down hot spots.'

Sidcup is a popular commuter area with an average house price of Â£335,000, located less than 15 miles south-east of central London and sandwiched between Bromley and Dartford.
