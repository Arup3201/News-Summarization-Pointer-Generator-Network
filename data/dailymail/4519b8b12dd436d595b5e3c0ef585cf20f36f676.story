A cupboard surfing canine got itself into a spot of bother after it jumped down from a door and broke it off it hinges.

The hilarious footage captured in Borehamwood shows a Rottweiler named Dexter perched on top of a cupboard door looking out the window.

Asking him what he is doing, the owner laughs at the sight of his large dog surfing on the open door while it seemingly considers diving out of the open window.

Moving around on the door, the dog paws at the window sill and causes its owner to laugh even more hysterically.

Catching his breath, the owner then calls for the Rottweiler to get down from the cupboard door.

But the dog chooses to ignore him and instead continues to look longingly out of the window.

On the third time of asking, Dexter reacts to his owner's command, but instead of jumping down looks about anxiously as if trying to work out how he is going to go about doing it.

Manoeuvring himself to the right, the dog goes as if to jump but before he is able to do so the cupboard door comes off its hinges and crashes to the floor.

Falling down alongside the door, the dog knocks a number of items off the adjacent counter.

The dog lands, momentarily eyes up the damage it has caused and makes a quick get away.

Staying silent for the rest of the clip, the owner films the broken door – one hinge still attached to it, the other attached to the frame.

The video concludes on a shot of the dog looking guilty as it stands in the hallway.
