When Carol Roe stands at her back gate she can look out across the road and see her granddaughter's grave.

On August 2 the Geraldton woman's 22-year-old granddaughter Julieka Dhu was arrested and then kept in jail over an unpaid $1000 fine, and three days later she was dead.

'My granddaughter got killed in custody,' Ms Roe told the Daily Mail Australia.

'She's laying over there when she should be sitting with me in my backyard.'

Julieka Dhu, 22, died in police custody on August 4 after being held in jail for three days over an unpaid fine

The Geraldton woman had broken ribs and bleeding on the lungs, but an autopsy did not determine the exact cause of death

Almost three months later, Ms Dhu's family is still waiting for answers.

They don't know what the fine she hadn't paid was for and they don't know how she died.

Family have learned that Ms Dhu had broken ribs and bleeding on the lungs.

They know she was taken to hospital, but they have no idea why she was moved back to the South Hedland police watch-house in Western Australia when she needed medical attention. 

An autopsy did not determine the exact cause of death.

Ms Roe says she will never get her 'happy-go-lucky' granddaughter back, but now she wants justice.

'I want the justice and truth and to know why did it happen to my granddaughter over $1000,' she said.

WA Premier Colin Barnett has admitted the police investigation into her death has 'taken longer than it should have', but has promised the coroner will uncover the truth.

Ms Dhu's grandmother Carol Roe said almost three months later the family is still waiting for answers

Deaths in Custody Watch Committee WA spokesman Marc Newhouse said when Ms Dhu died she had blood on her lungs, a head injury and fractured ribs.

In a change.org petition, which has almost 53,000 signatures, Carol Roe is calling on WA Premier Colin Barnett for:

'It's unclear how she sustained those injuries and whether it was between being transported to police station, we just don't know,' Mr Newhouse told Daily Mail Australia.

The man who was in the cell next to Ms Dhu, 61-year-old Malcolm Dick Wilson, said she was crying out in pain while in jail, The Australian reported.

'Police was just ignoring her. I couldn't do anything to help her, I felt so bad,' Mr Wilson said.

Ms Dhu's boyfriend Dion Ruffin, 39, who was taken into custody along with Ms Dhu over the breach of a restraining order relating to a second woman, said she was taken back and forth between hospital and jail.

'When the cops finally agreed to take her to hospital the last time they were laughing and saying she was acting,' Mr Ruffin told The Australian.

'They opened the cell, and I heard one of them say "Get up", but she couldn't and she was begging for help to get up and I heard a big thud, and then silence.'

Ms Roe is now petitioning WA Premier for a 'timely' coronial inquest into Ms Dhu's death in custody and an independent authority to investigate all custodial deaths.

'Every time another person dies, police do their own internal report,' Ms Roe wrote on change.org.

'Police officers that know each other, interview each other.

'In other countries like the UK, they have an external and independent person investigate – I don't know if the police did anything wrong, but how will I ever know if we don't have an open investigation?'

Ms Roe says she will never get her 'happy go lucky' granddaughter back, but now she wants justice

At a series of rallies across Perth, Geraldton and Hedland October 23, Ms Roe and hundreds of other people marched to demand for justice for Ms Dhu

Ms Roe is also calling for another Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, more than two decades after then-Prime minister Bob Hawke established a Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1987.

'Enough is enough,' she said.

'Too many more people have died since then and now my granddaughter.'

A family spokeswoman, Lara Pullin, said WA had Australia's highest rate of indigenous incarceration, with 38 per cent of those in custody of indigenous background. For juveniles, it is 64 per cent.

She said there had been 400 indigenous deaths in custody since the Royal Commission and the rate was actually increasing because of the large number of indigenous people in jail.

At a series of rallies across Perth, Geraldton and Hedland October 23, Ms Roe and hundreds of other people marched to demand for justice for Ms Dhu.

WA Premier Colin Barnett addressed the crowd at the Perth rally and promised to complete the coroner's report as quickly as possible

Premier Barnett addressed the crowd at the Perth rally and promised to complete the coroner's report as quickly as possible.

'With respect to the loss of Julieka, it is a complicated situation, but I want to promise you that whatever happened all of the circumstances… the truth and the full truth will come out, I will ensure that,' he said.

'There is a police in investigation that should be completed very shortly, it's taken longer than it should have.

'The coroner will thoroughly review every single thing that happened and we'll try and ensure that that the coroner's report is complete quickly but done properly.'

A spokeswoman for Mr Barnett told Daily Mail Australia that WA Police have indicated they will provide their internal report to the coroner by the end of October.

It is unclear how long a coronial inquest will take. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the WA coroner's office for comment.
