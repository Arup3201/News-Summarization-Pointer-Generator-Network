He has become a household name thanks to his sporting talents and down-to-earth personality.

And now, fresh from his boxing ring success, it seems there is no stopping Freddie Flintoff as he unveils a second collection for menswear label Jacamo. 

The 35-year-old former England cricketer is, unsurprisingly, extremely pleased with how it has turned out - because he wears every single item himself.

'While my stuff isn't depicting high fashion, it's the sort of stuff I'd wear. I wear things that I feel comfortable in
to be honest, I don't follow what's in fashion or the latest
trends I just like to go out feeling comfortable and my line reflects this,' he told MailOnline.

Career change: Freddie Flintoff has left his cricket bat behind and tried his hand at clothes designing, here he presents his second collection for Jacamo

The 6ft 4in former Lancashire player embodies the Manchester-based brand's ethos, which aims to cater to men of all shapes and sizes and is well known for its Simply Be and High & Mighty plus-size brands.

When the label announced their collaboration with Freddie, Alan White, chief executive of N Brown, said: 'With his broad athletic build, [Freddie] will no doubt provide a strong point of identity for our customer base.'

High and mighty: The range of casual clothes and suits has been designed for men of all shapes and sizes and with his tall stature, Freddie is the perfection depiction of that

Freddie is the perfect advocate for the brand and each item of the Flintoff by Jacamo spring/summer range is available in medium to 5XL and in a range of lengths to suit men of varying sizes.

Looking casual and cool, the burly blond tried his dab hand at modelling his latest offering in an East London studio shoot.

Speaking about the photographs, he said: 'It's weird looking at yourself. I don't think I will ever become a model. I once did a catwalk for a charity fashion show, it wasn't fun.

'Walking down there and back, I know it sounds so 
easy but I've never been so self conscious in my life.

'I didn't particularly get good feedback.'

Comfortable: Freddie says he doesn't follow high fashion but has designed a line that is stylish yet mainly focuses on comfort

So while he won't be following in fellow athlete David Beckham's modelling footsteps anytime soon, he does admire the footballer's style.

'I am happy how I am and there is no one I want to look like but Beckham dresses well, he really is quite sharp.'

He also rates his League of Their Own co-star Jamie Redknapp's suited and booted fashion choices.

'Out of the League of Their Own boys, I've got to say Jamie is the best 
dressed or he would be gutted, he loves his clothes.

Model behaviour: Freddie looked like a professional modelling his clothes in an East London studio but says he would never consider a career in it

'I think Jack Whitehall has got the student look down to a T, he looks like
he needs a good wash.

'Having said that, I saw him on the TV the other 
night at an awards show and I have never seen him so smart, he combed 
his hair and everything.

'As for James Corden, he tries his best on the show and he likes his cardigans and ties but Jamie leads the way.'

The day job: Freddie and his co-stars are currently filming more League of Their Own and he rates Jamie Redknapp's style

Following his professional boxing debut in November where he beat American Richard Dawson, Freddie is taking some time out and has moved back up north with his family.

'I am currently taking stock after my boxing. We have moved back up north and are getting the kids settled into school, which I am really enjoying.'

The new Spring/Summer Flintoff by Jacamo collection will be available online at Jacamo.co.uk from the 26th February and the current collection is available to view today.
