Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his 29-year marriage to his his wife, Lyudmila, was over - after removing his wedding band as they watched the ballet together.

The 60-year-old and his 55-year-old wife broke the news of the end of the 29-year marriage in an obviously staged TV interview after a night at the ballet.

Before the ballet at the Kremlin Palace,
 Putin was pictured wearing his wedding ring, but he must have removed 
it during the performance because he was not wearing it by the time he 
left and was interviewed.

Asked on Rossiya-24 television about 
longstanding rumours that the Putins no longer lived together, the 
60-year-old Putin said: 'That is true.'

Lyudmila Putin said it had been a 'our common decision. And our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other.'

Asked whether they were divorced, Lyudmila said it was a 'civilised divorce'.

But neither clarified whether they were legally divorced and Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not know.

The obviously staged interview made no mention of Alina Kabayeva, a 30-year-old former gymnast who is rumoured to have been Putin's mistress for years.

Rumours about an affair between the Russian president and Miss Kabayeva have dogged them for years

Miss Kabayeva, who is alleged to have given birth to Putin's lovechild, is now a politician after retiring from a glittering career in gymnastics in which she represented her country at the Olympics twice.

Rumours about Putin's alleged affair with Miss Kabayeva first surfaced five years ago when a Russian newspaper owned by the oligarch Alexander Lebedev reported that Putin wanted to marry his gymnast mistress.

Putin angrily denied the story, and the newspaper was closed down shortly afterwards, which many attributed to Putin's rage.  Further stories later emerged claiming that Miss Kabayeva had had a baby by the president, but both sides denied them.

Mr and Mrs Putin had last been seen in public together at Putin's inauguration to his third presidential term on May 7, 2012.

Married just a few weeks short of 30 years, the Putins announced the decision on state television after attending a ballet performance Thursday evening in the Kremlin.

In April speculation was mounting as to why the first lady of Russia was rarely seen by his side

Lyudmila Putin said that the split had been a 'our common decision. And our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other'

His wife has rarely been seen in public during her husband's long tenure at the top of Russian politics.

'I don't like publicity and flying is difficult for me,' she said.

In the televised announcement of their divorce, Putin appeared reserved and Lyudmila smiled tentatively.

'We practically never saw each other. To each his own life,' Putin said.

Lyudmila Putin said, 'We will eternally be very close people. I'm thankful ... that he supports me.'

There were no immediate indications of how the move would be perceived by the public. Divorce is common in Russia, and nearly 700,000 pairs dissolved their marriages in 2009, according to UNICEF.

Unfounded - and vehemently denied - rumours suggested that the president had conducted affairs with other women

Russian leaders, unlike their 
counterparts in the West, generally keep their personal lives well out 
of public view. Mikhail Gorbachev's wife Raisa raised many Russians' 
hackles by her visibility, flair for fashionable dress and forthright 
comments.

But Putin also has made a point of supporting traditional social values and appearing at holiday masses of the Orthodox Church.

The
 church permits divorce under some circumstances; it is not clear if the
 Putins sought pastoral advice or permission before the split.

The pair, who married in 1983 and 
have two daughters, recently attracted attention after they were never 
seen in public together.

An official family portrait has been 
issued, and photographs of their daughters Maria, 27, and Yekaterina, 
26, have never been printed by the Russian media.

In April speculation was mounting as to why the first lady of Russia was rarely seen by the president's side.

Unfounded
 rumours suggested the president had an affair with spy-turned-lingerie 
model Anna Chapman, which has been strongly denied, was behind the 
former Aeroflot-hostess' disappearance from public view.

In October 2010 the Putins tried to quell rumours they had divorced by posing for pictures as they jointly answered questions for the national census.

The high-profile politician has been a constant fixture in leading the country.

He was re-elected to to the role of President in May last year, and he previously held the post from 2000 to 2008.

In between his these offices, he was Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012.

The Russian office of first lady demands the attendance of many official ceremonies and functions of state - either by the side of the president or to represent him.

Russia heavily frowns upon the First Lady holding outside employment while occupying the office.
