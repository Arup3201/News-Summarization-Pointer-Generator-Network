A top Tory has accused GPs of ‘moaning’ so much they are putting off new recruits.

Health minister Lord Howe said ‘a lot’ of the problems recruiting family doctors was because of the ‘perceptions of general practice’.

Labour said blaming doctors for the crisis of recruitment to GP surgeries was a ‘new low’ for the Government.

Conservative health minister Lord Howe said 'moaning' GPs were partly to blame for the recruitment crisis

Lord Howe made the remarks at a fringe event at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week.

It risks undermining the move by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron to mend fences with NHS workers in the run up to the general election.

The Tories are currently trailing Labour by more than 20 percentage points in the polls on which party is most trusted to safeguard the NHS.

Lord Howe’s outspoken attack comes amid warnings from the Royal College of GPs over the growing pressure on doctors’ surgeries.

The body representing GPs said the government’s plan to open surgeries seven days a week, 12 hours a day, risked overwhelming an already-stretched service.

It called for thousands more GPs to be hired and more cash to keep surgeries open for longer.

The British Medical Association has also warned that waits of one or two weeks to see a doctor are ‘becoming the norm’.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Lord Howe's remarks were a 'new low'

The number of family doctors has fallen since the coalition came to power and the take-up of training places is the worst since 2007.

But Lord Howe said family doctors themselves were part of the problem.

He said: ‘A lot of this depends on perceptions of general practice.

‘The more people start sort of moaning about how difficult it is to be a GP, the more you'll put off aspiring young doctors.

‘So my message to the royal college… is very gently to say: let's have a narrative that says general practice is one of the most rewarding careers you can have in medicine, and … this is a solvable problem, the strains in general practice are a solvable problem.’

Lord Howe said there would be extra funding by 2020 to provide an extra 4,900 GPs. At its party conference, Labour promised at its conference to invest in 8,000 more GPs.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the Tories of trying to blame GPs for problems of their own making.

He said: ‘Ministers in this government always seek to blame others for their own failings. But to have a senior minister blaming “moaning” GPs for the GP recruitment crisis is a new low even for them.

‘Lord Howe has admitted in private what ministers have so far publicly refused to accept – that some rural and inner city areas have suffered disproportionate cuts and that people are having to wait far too long for appointments.’
