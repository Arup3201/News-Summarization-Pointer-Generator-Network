America's financial problems could not be solved by raising taxes on the rich, Bill Clinton said on Wednesday.

During an economic speech in Washington, D.C. at Georgetown University caught on tape by Breitbart News former President Bill Clinton hypothetically said taking all of rich peoples' money wouldn't be enough to balance the United States budget.

Clinton, who is the richest living president, said he doesn't mind paying higher taxes than other Americans, 'but you could tax me at a hundred percent, and we couldn't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget.'

USA Today estimated in 2013 that Bill Clinton had a net worth of $55 million and counting. The former president makes millions of dollars a year in speaking fees. More recent estimates put his net worth at $80 million and he and wife Hillary Clinton's combined net worth anywhere from $100 to $200 million.

Raising taxes on the rich has become a rallying cry for progressives in the Obama era.

President Barack Obama has made his quest to make Americans making more than $250,000 a year pay their 'fair share' in taxes a cornerstone of his presidency. 

Obama's 'fair share' strategy is based
 on the idea that middle-class Americans shouldn't 
be paying the same tax rate as 'rich' Americans because it creates an 
unfair disparity in wealth.

In his 2014 budget released earlier this month, President Obama calls for a minimum 30 percent tax rate on millionaires like the Clintons and Warren Buffet as part of a revived effort to institute the Buffet Rule. The White House claims that many Americans who make $1 million or more are paying less than 15 percent in taxes. Obama wants to double their tax rate.

'Anyone who does well for themselves should do their fair share in 
return, so that more people have the opportunity to get ahead—not just a
 few,' the White House's page on the Buffet Rule explains.

During his two-hour economic speech on Wednesday at Georgetown, his alma mater, Clinton said he supported President Barack Obama's plan to let the Bush tax cuts on the rich to expire because people in his income bracket have 'enough disposable income that it didn't change our consumption patterns much.'

But you cut spending too much or raise taxes too much, it wouldn't work, Clinton said.

'You can only balance a budget if you have adequate revenues, adequate spending restraints and adequate growth. The country needs growth,' Clinton said. 'Then everybody will do well.'

'Hillary and I, and some of our friends in this audience who live in New York, probably pay the highest aggregate tax rates in America, and I thank God every April 15 that I'm able to do it. I never ...  The family I grew up in. It's fine. I'm not ... I'm thankful,' Clinton said, choking up a little, as he recalled  his childhood.

'But you could tax me at a hundred percent, and we couldn't bring growth back into the economy enough to balance the budget,' Clinton continued. 'It's got to be a growth strategy.'

No federal politician has advocated that the U.S. should begin confiscating wealthy Americans' income in it's entirety. Progressives say they want they want the rich to pay more of their income in taxes, but they have been vague on how tax money they would consider enough.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan once threw out a theoretical 100 percent tax rate during an interview and was smacked down by left-leaning fact-checking site Politifact.

'If you took all the income from every millionaire in America today, it would run the government for about four months,' Ryan said during an appearance on Meet the Press in 2011.

Politifact slammed Ryan's example as 'a wildly hypothetical scenario.'

'A 100 percent tax obviously 
would have negative effects and is a political non-starter,' Politifact said.

Based on the 2008 data Ryan said he was using, Politifact said such a policy would not even come close to fulfilling the United State's debt obligations. It would eliminate the budget deficit, however, it said.
