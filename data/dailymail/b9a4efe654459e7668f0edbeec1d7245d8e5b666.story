Bosses are more interested in hiring someone they fancy - or who will be good to hang out with - than the very best candidates, according to a new study.

More than half of employers rate having the right looks, background and hobbies as the most important assets for applicants at job interviews.

Sociologist Dr Lauren Rivera, an assistant professor of management and organisations, said: 'Of course employers are looking for people who have the baseline of skills to effectively do the job.

'But, beyond that, employers really want people who they will bond with, who they will feel good around, who will be their friend and maybe even their romantic partner.

'As a result, employers don't necessarily hire the most skilled candidates.'

The study published in the American Sociological Review is the first investigation of its kind into whether shared culture between employers and job candidates matters.

It was based on 120 interviews with professionals involved in undergraduate and graduate hiring in elite US investment banks, law firms and management consulting companies as well as participant observation of a recruiting department.

Dr Rivera found evaluators at firms often valued their personal feelings of comfort, acceptance and excitement above identifying candidates with superior cognitive or technical skills.

In fact more than one-in-two ranked 'cultural fit' - the perceived similarity to a firm's existing employee base in leisure pursuits, background and self-presentation - as the most important criterion at the job interview stage.

Dr Rivera, of Northwestern University in the United States, said: 'It is important to note this does not mean employers are hiring unqualified people.

'But my findings demonstrate that - in many respects - employers hire in a manner more closely resembling the choice of friends or romantic partners than how one might expect employers to select new workers.

'When you look at the decision to date or marry someone what you think about is commonalities. Do you have a similar level of education? Did you go to a similar calibre school? Do you enjoy similar activities? Are you excited to talk to each other? Do you feel the spark?

'These types of things are salient at least to the employers I've studied.'

The study also found the cultural similarities valued at elite professional service firms have an impact on whether a candidate will be hired.

Dr Rivera said: 'Evaluators are predominately white, Ivy League-educated, upper-middle or upper class men and women who tend to have more stereotypically masculine leisure pursuits and favour extracurricular activities associated with people of their background.

'Given less affluent students are more likely to believe achievement in the classroom rather than on the field or in the concert hall matters most for future success and focus their energies accordingly, the types of cultural similarities valued in elite firms' hiring processes has the potential to create inequalities in access to elite jobs based on parental socioeconomic status."

She said the importance of cultural fit in hiring practices at elite professional service firms are probably present across other types of occupations to some extent.

She said: 'I think the process is generalisable, but I think the degree to which cultural similarity matters in the decision to hire varies across occupations depending on their technical demands, their degree of social demands and how structured interviews are.

'So, for example, if you were hiring a neurosurgeon, I think there would be more of an emphasis on performance than cultural fit.'

In addition the types of cultural similarities employers value may not be the same for all occupations.

Dr Rivera said: 'Cultivating leisure time is a hallmark of the upper-middle and upper classes, and it's really important as a class marker and as a source of identity.

'You may see different types of cultural similarities that matter in occupations that are less elite.'

She conducted the interviews - 40 per industry - from 2006 through 2008 and the fieldwork within the recruiting department of an elite professional service firm over nine months in 2006 and 2007.
