A panel of federal appellate judges has ordered the state of Missouri to halt the execution of a death row inmate tonight, which would have been the first in the nation following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday cited concerns about Russell Bucklew's rare medical condition, which raised the risk of 'unnecessary pain and suffering by the inmate.'

Bucklew, 46, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 12.01am Wednesday for killing a southeast Missouri man in front of his children during a violent crime spree in 1996. After the murder, Bucklew raped his ex-girlfriend and shot at a state trooper in a police chase.

Spared: An appeals court stayed the execution of Russell Bucklew, pictured, saying that the state of Missouri has failed to prove that the convicted killer would not be subjected to pain and suffering  caused by his rare medical condition during lethal injection

His attorneys, Lindsay Runnels and 
Cheryl Pilate, had asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt 
the execution, citing concerns about Missouri's secretive process of 
purchasing the execution drug pentobarbital and worries that Bucklew 
could suffer during injection because of a rare medical condition.

‘The
 state does not have the right to inflict extreme, torturous pain during
 an execution,’ Pilate said before the appellate court’s ruling. ‘We 
still hope that Mr. Bucklew's grave medical condition and compromised 
airway will persuade the governor or a court to step back from this 
extremely risky execution.’

Less
 than eight hours before lethal injection Tuesday, the court of appeals ruled 2-1 to stay Bucklew's execution, writing in the decision that the state has failed to disprove Bucklew's claim that his medical condition could cause him pain and suffering during injection.

'Bucklew's unrebutted medical evidence demonstrates the requisite sufficient likelihood of unnecessary pain and suffering beyond the constitutionally permissible amount inherent in all executions,' the ruling reads.

'The irreparable harm to Bucklew is great in comparison to the harm to the state from staying the execution.'

Cheryl Pilate, Bucklew's attorney, told NBC News they were 'thrilled' that the appeals court recognized the gravity of her client's condition.   

It was not immediately clear Tuesday evening if the state would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the stay of execution.

Gov.
 Jay Nixon, a Democrat and a proponent of the death penalty, said that 
while he is considering Bucklew's clemency request, he hasn't seen a 
reason to intervene.

‘This
 guy committed very, very heinous crimes, and while it's a difficult and
 challenging part of this job, we'll continue to move forward unless a 
court says otherwise,’ Nixon said Monday.

In
 a separate appeal filed Tuesday to the U.S. Supreme Court, Bucklew 
claimed corrections staff seized and destroyed information that he 
wanted to include in his clemency petition to Nixon.

A
 spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster offered no comment
 but cited a court document in which the state denies taking or 
destroying anything pertinent to the clemency request.Bucklew's attorney said they also have appealed a separate ruling denying their request to record the execution on video.

Victim: Michael Sanders, pictured, was shot and killed by Bucklew in front of his two sons. Stephanie Pruitt and her two daughters, who had been staying with Sanders, also witnessed the killing

Bucklew suffers from a congenital condition known as cavernous hemangioma that causes damaged blood vessels and tumors in his head, brain, neck, and throat. His attorneys say he could experience great suffering during the execution process.

He told AP in a phone interview Friday that he often bleeds from the eyes and ears. He has constant pain in the face that requires pain medication every six hours.

In light of his condition and the botched April execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma, Bucklew said he's worried about what will happen to him.

'I'm worried it could be painful,' Bucklew said. 'I'm worried about being brain-dead. I understand the family (of the victim) wants closure, but we're victimizing my family here, too.'

Bucklew's attorneys have also cited concerns about Missouri's secretive procurement of the execution drug.

Lethal injection: Former Cape Girardeau county prosecutor Morley Swingle has called Bucklew a 'homicidal Energiser bunny'

In March 1996, Bucklew tracked down his estranged girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, at the Cape Girardeau mobile home of Michael Sanders. Pruitt and her two young daughters were staying there with Sanders and his two young sons.

Bucklew shot Sanders in front of Pruitt and the kids, killing him. He grabbed Pruitt, took her to a remote area, and raped her.

When a Missouri state trooper spotted Bucklew later that night on Interstate 55, a chase began. Bucklew shot at the trooper and missed. The trooper shot back and grazed Bucklew's head. He later escaped from jail, hid inside the home of Pruitt's mother and attacked her with a hammer. She was able to get away and Bucklew was caught a short time later.

Bucklew said he was remorseful for the crime, and said he plans to revise his will to provide money for a college fund for the sons of the victim.

Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, in a court response last Thursday, questioned why Bucklew waited until now to raise those concerns.

'There is no good reason Bucklew could not have brought his current suit six months ago, or six years ago,' Koster wrote.

Former Cape Girardeau County 
prosecutor Morley Swingle said he has no sympathy for him. He earlier referred to Bucklew as a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' when speaking to the Guardian.

'I
 truly believe he's probably the most evil person I ever prosecuted 
because he's such a pure sociopath,' Swingle said. 'When he had it in 
his mind to hurt somebody, you just couldn't stop him.'

Swingle said concerns about the pentobarbital used in the execution 'are grasping at straws. It's a very deadly poison and when they give it to him, he'll die.'

Bucklew's execution would be the seventh in Missouri since November using pentobarbital, and there have been no apparent problems with the previous six.

Botched execution: Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, pictured, took 43 minutes to die after a lethal injection went awry in April

It would also be the first death penalty carried out in the U.S. since April 29, when Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett writhed on the gurney, gritted his teeth, and moaned before dying of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution.

A doctor inside the death chamber during the execution reported that Lockett's vein collapsed and some of the lethal drugs were absorbed into his tissue or leaked out.

The incident prompted renewed concern about lethal injection in an era when many states, including Oklahoma and Missouri, have changed drugs they administer and refuse to disclose the source of the execution drugs.

Oklahoma put on hold a second execution scheduled for the same night as Lockett's death, while the state investigates what happened. A Texas inmate was scheduled to be put to death this week but a federal appeals court granted a stay of execution so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing that he is mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty.
