Oscar Pistorius was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a panel of mental health experts has concluded.

The chief prosecutor at the athlete's murder trial referred to key parts 
of the conclusions today as the hearing resumed following a month's break.

During this time, a psychologist and three psychiatrists also assessed whether the double-amputee runner was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his act when he shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door.

A panel of health experts has concluded Oscar Pistorius (pictured listening to evidence today) was not suffering from a mental illness when he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, his trial heard today

Back in court: After a six-week break, Oscar Pistorius arrives in court in Pretoria to resume his murder trial 

The panel's reports were submitted to 
Judge Thokozile Masipa, with prosecutor Gerrie Nel noting that the experts believed Pistorius was 
'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he killed 
Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model.

'At the time of the alleged offences, the accused did not suffer from a mental disorder or mental defect that affected his ability to distinguish between the rightful or wrongful nature of his deeds,' Mr Nel read from a report submitted to the court.

Both Mr Nel and defence lawyer Barry Roux accepted the findings of the panel of psychiatrists and psychologists after 30 days of evaluation.

The trial promptly resumed as Mr Roux called surgeon Gerald Versfeld, who amputated Pistorius' lower legs when he was 11 months old, to testify about the runner's disability and the difficulty and pain he endured while walking or standing on his stumps without support.

Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle.

At Roux's invitation, Judge Masipa and her two legal assessors left the dais to closely inspect the stumps of Pistorius as he sat on a bench. 

The panel's reports were submitted to Judge Thokozile Masipa, and prosecutor Gerrie Nel referred to key parts of the conclusions, noting that the experts believed Pistorius was 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act' when he killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument, and has portrayed the Olympic athlete as a hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement

The athlete was on his stumps when he 
killed Steenkamp, and his defense team has argued that he was more 
likely to try to confront a perceived danger rather than flee because of
 his limited ability to move without prostheses.

Versfeld noted that Pistorius' disability made him 'vulnerable in a dangerous situation.'

During
 cross examination, Nel questioned Versfeld's objectivity and raised the
 possibility that Pistorius could have run away from a perceived 
intruder on the night of the shooting.

He
 also said Pistorius rushed back to his bedroom after the shooting and 
made other movements that indicated he was not as hampered as Versfeld 
was suggesting.

Later in the hearing, the judge said she 
was 'very unhappy' that the state were unable to 
produce a piece of evidence - an electrical cord - from Pistorius' 
house.

Roux also called acoustics expert Ivan Lin to testify about the challenges of hearing something accurately from a distance.

Neighbors have said in court that they heard a woman screaming on the night Pistorius shot Steenkamp, which could bolster the prosecution's claim that the couple were arguing before Pistorius opened fire.

The defense, however, has suggested the witnesses were actually hearing the high-pitched screams of a distraught Pistorius after he realized he had shot Steenkamp.

The psychiatric
 evaluation came after a psychiatrist, Dr. Merryll Vorster, testified 
for the defense that Pistorius, who has said he feels vulnerable because
 of his disability and long-held worry about crime, had an anxiety 
disorder that could have contributed to the killing in the early hours 
of February 14, 2013.

He testified that he opened fire after mistakenly thinking there was a dangerous intruder in the toilet.

Pistorius (pictured arriving at court today) was evaluated as an outpatient at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria, the South African capital. He has been staying at the upscale home of his uncle

Mr Nel has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp after a 
Valentine's Day argument, and has portrayed the Olympic athlete as a 
hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement.

But
 he requested an independent inquiry into Pistorius' state of mind, 
based on concern the defense would argue Pistorius was not guilty 
because of mental illness.

Pistorius
 faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated 
murder, and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder 
without premeditation or negligent killing. He is free on bail.
