Barack Obama claimed that the AARP had endorsed his plans to reform Medicare during the first presidential debate in Denver last night.

But just a few hours later the senior citizens' group spoke out to deny that it was supporting the President, and insisted that it did not wish to be drawn into the political horse-race.

The rejection of his message came as another blow for Mr Obama, who has been widely pilloried for his underwhelming performance in a debate which most commentators agreed was won by Mitt Romney.

Clash: The President criticised Mitt Romney's plans to reform Medicare and introduce a voucher system

The Republican challenger repeated a well-rehearsed argument that the President had cut $716billion from Medicare in order to fund his own 'Obamacare' health reform.

In response, Mr Obama denounced his opponent's plan to replace part of Medicare with a voucher programme for future retirees.

'I donâ€™t think vouchers are the right way to go,' the President said. 'And this is not only my opinion.

'AARP thinks that the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.'

Greeting: But the candidates had harsh words for each other before this family get-together at the end

Minutes later, he made another reference to the powerful organisation which represents close to 40million elderly Americans.

'When you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of insurance companies,' Mr Obama argued. 'And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.

'And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.'

But in a statement issued late on Wednesday night, senior vice-president John Hishta rejected the link between the AARP and the President's re-election campaign.

Jeered: Mr Romney's running mate Paul Ryan received a hostile reception when he pledged to repeal Obamacare during the AARP convention in New Orleans last month

'While we respect the rights of each campaign to make its case to voters, AARP has never consented to the use of its name by any candidate or political campaign,' he said.

'AARP is a non-partisan organisation and we do not endorse political candidates nor co-ordinate with any candidate or political party.'

The group drew controversy in 2009 when it publicly pledged support for Mr Obama's signature healthcare reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

And its members entered the political fray once again last month when they booed Mr Romney's running mate Paul Ryan after he promised to repeal Obamacare while addressing the AARP convention in New Orleans.

The elderly are considered a crucial voting bloc, as they are disproportionately likely to make it to the polls on November 6 and make up a large part of the population of key swing states such as Florida.
