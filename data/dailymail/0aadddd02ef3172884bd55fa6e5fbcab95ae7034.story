Miraculous: Kate Weaver, pictured with her newborn son Toby, gave birth while still paralysed

A woman who had a stroke days before she was due to have a baby gave birth to her son while still paralysed.

Nurse Kate Weaver was out shopping when she realised she was having a stroke.

She managed to tell her husband: ‘We need to go to hospital. It’s not the baby, I’m really ill’ – moments before losing her ability to speak  and move.

Doctors managed to stabilise her, but the family was faced with an agonising choice of whether to undergo a life-saving procedure which posed risks for both mother and baby.

The procedure, called thrombolysis, involves the administration of a clot-busting drug.

It had never been performed on a pregnant woman at the hospital – and there was a risk of Mrs Weaver and her baby  suffering a brain haemorrhage.

However, the family decided to go ahead.

Mrs Weaver recovered her speech within four hours but remained almost totally paralysed down her left side.

Then just three days later with the help of an epidural, her son Toby was born weighing 6lb 11oz.

Such was the scale of Mrs Weaver’s stroke, in September last year, that she had to learn to walk again.

Toby was allowed to go home at a week old and his mother joined him at the family home in Wem, Shropshire, a week later where she began the long road to recovery.

Now just ten months on, Mrs Weaver and her mechanic husband, Tim, 36,  are delighted with the extent of her recovery.

Mrs
 Weaver, a haematology nurse at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital where she 
gave birth, said: ‘I can’t describe it how scary having a stroke and 
knowing that I was about to give birth was – I didn’t think I was going 
to make it.

Healthy: Mrs Weaver recovered fully from her stroke - which left her unable to walk or speak - and her son is developing normally

‘I was very lucky knowing exactly what was happening to me so we could act quickly.

‘But having so much knowledge made it so much worse because I knew what might happen.’

The drama began when 29-year-old Mrs Weaver thought she had cramps while out shopping. She sat down to rest but, unable to push herself up with her left arm, realised she was having a stroke.

Filled with dread for her unborn baby, she managed to alert her husband before becoming paralysed.

Mrs Weaver
 believes if she had not been with her husband she might not have 
reached hospital in time. She said: ‘I knew straight away what was going
 on in my body.

‘If
 I’d been at home on my own I just don’t know what would have happened. 
Toby’s a little miracle and he’s developing absolutely fine.’

Treatment: Mrs Weaver had to stay in hospital for a week longer than her son, and needed lengthy physiotherapy in order to walk again

She added: ‘I’m a nurse and it still shocks me that someone so young could have a stroke. There was a risk to him when I was thrombolysed but who knows what would have happened if I hadn’t been?’

Although her speech had returned, she remained partially paralysed and has been undergoing therapy to regain her movement.

She undertook pioneering electrical impulse treatment at Physiofunction in Northampton to help her walk again.

The treatment, targeting the nerves, has been shown to help stroke victims who suffer from movement difficulties.

Mrs Weaver, who has now improved to the point where she has been able to return to work, said: ‘Now every milestone for Toby is a milestone for me and an extra feeling of relief we can get back to normal.’
