Police are investigating possible criminal links between slain drug dealer Jamie Gao, a murdered casino high roller and a missing Sydney businessman.

Detectives believe the three men, whose deaths and disappearance occurred within four months, may have had common associates within the underworld, reports The Sydney Morning Herald.

University of Technology student Gao was shot dead in a storage until at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20 in what police believe was a drug deal gone wrong. Former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara have been charged with the 20-year-old's murder.

Jamie Gao, 20, was shot dead in a storage unit at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20. Police are now investigating underworld links between Gao, murdered gambler Peter Ran Hoang and missing businessman Phuoc Minh Nguyen

Businessman Phuoc Ming (Paul) Nguyen, 50, is suspected of having links to drugs and money laundering. He was last known to have been alive on the night of May 1 when he made a telephone call near Bankstown, also in Sydney's south west.

Nguyen, who had recently sold two Baker's Delight franchises, was seen driving out of the Hilton Hotel in George Street, Sydney, in a brown Renault Latitude earlier that day. 

Big-time gambler Peter Tan Hoang, 36, was awaiting trial in Melbourne over the possession of $1.5 million in cash believed to be the proceeds of crime when he was shot dead at Croydon Park in Sydney's inner west on September 7.

Detectives are still searching for Hoang's killers and have appealed for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in Dunmore Street in the early hours of the day he was killed to come forward. 

A source familiar with the facts of the Gao case said he had not heard Hoang or Nguyen's names linked to that murder investigation but confirmed Gao had associated with Hong Kong triad members.

'He was clearly moving in circles with other drug dealers,' the source said. 'There's no doubt about that.' 

Phuoc Minh Nguyen, a former Baker's Delight franchise owner, has been missing since May 1. Police are investigating his links to drugs and money laundering and believe he may have been murdered

Peter Tan Hoang gambled more than $90 million at Australian casinos and was awaiting trial for possessing $1.5 million believed to be the proceeds of crime when he was shot dead at Croydon Park, in Sydney's inner west on September 7

Detectives reportedly believe the three men may have shared underworld connections.

'We believe they may have been associating with the same people and we are exploring the links,' police told the Herald. 

Gao was shot dead in what police allege was a drug deal gone wrong. Former detectives Rogerson, 73, and McNamara, 55, are on remand charged with his murder. Both have said they will plead not guilty.

CCTV footage shows Gao walking from his white Nissan Silvia at a Padstow industrial estate on Arab Street on May 20 carrying a bag police allege contained ice worth $3 million.

Cental Local Court has heard Gao got into another car with Rogerson and McNamara, who drove to a nearby storage unit where Gao was killed for the contents of the bag.

Further CCTV images allegedly captured McNamara and Rogerson carrying the body of Gao, who was shot twice in the chest, out of the storage unit. His body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in waters off Cronulla a week later. 

Days after the alleged murder, 2.8 kilograms of ice was allegedly found in McNamara's car. 

Former detective Roger Rogerson has been charged with murdering Jamie Gao in a drug deal gone wrong at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20. The decorated officer has been refused bail

Former detective Glen McNamara has been refused bail on charges of murdering student Jamie Gao and commercial drug supply in relation to what police allege was a drug deal gone horribly wrong

Rogerson's barrister, George Thomas, has described the prosecution case against his client as 'weak' and said 'there was enough time for a killing to take place in the absence of my client'.

He has conceded Rogerson 'assisted' in removing Gao’s body from the storage space and said it was possible the dead man could have pulled a gun first, leading McNamara to act in self defence.

McNamara’s barrister Ian Lloyd QC has previously said his client was involved in the disposal of Gao’s body but said McNamara may have walked into the unit and 'something happened which he did not expect to happen'.

In a recorded jail conversation between Rogerson and his wife Anne Melocco, Rogerson said he joined McNamara and Gao inside the storage unit to offer some 'fatherly advice'.  

'They’d been in there a fair while, I thought I’d go over and see what’s happening,' Rogerson told his wife on June 24. 'I thought I might be able to give him a bit of fatherly advice.'

The alleged murder weapon has not been found.

Crown prosecutor Chris Maxwell QC told Central Local Court in August that the two former detectives killed Gao after a plan to supply drugs changed into a 'rip off'.
