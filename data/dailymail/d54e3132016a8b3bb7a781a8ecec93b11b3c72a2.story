A new book claims that famous funnyman Eddie Murphy kept his brother from being deployed to Lebanon in the 1980s by promising to write jokes for then-Sen. Alfonso D'Amato and Rudy Giuliani. 

Author William Stadiem writes in 'Moneywood' that Murphy's brother, Charlie, was in the Navy and scheduled for deployment in the early 1980s. 

But his deployment was cancelled after Bob Wachs, Murphy's then-manager and co-founder of the Comic Strip comedy club 'leaned on Senator Al D'Amato... to help his constituent, with the quid pro quo that Eddie Murphy write funny material for D'Amato and his fellow Republican Rudy Giuliani.'

Claims: A new book claims that famous funnyman Eddie Murphy (left) kept his brother (right) from being deployed to Lebanon in the 1980s by promising to write jokes for then-Sen. Alfonso D'Amato and Rudy Giuliani

At the time, Giuliani was working in the Reagan administration as an associate attorney general.

Charlie Murphy, a comedian and actor, was never deployed and he instead joined his brother's entourage as Eddie Murphy built up his comedy empire. 

'Eddie Murphy would constantly joke that he should have left [his brother] in the Navy,' Stadiem claims.

The story hasn't been confirmed by any of the players involved, however. 

Charlie Murphy said the story is 'not even close to true' in an interview with the New York Post. 

Meanwhile, D'Amato's executive assistant, Dana Sanneman, told the Post, 'Sen. D’Amato remembers meeting Mr. Murphy’s manager at a comedy show and speaking about Charlie, but he doesn’t recall what, if anything, he did to help Charlie.'

According to a New York Times review of Stadiem's book, the author has a tendency to stretch reality in his new book.

Journalist Janet Maslin writes that 'at times [Stadiem] resorts to pure nonsense.'

'Even poolside readers have their standards for books like "Moneywood,' Maslin writes. 'And this one is a terrible disappointment.'

Stadiem is also the auther of 'Mr. S: My Life With Frank Sinatra' - a book written from the insight of Sinatra's valet, George Jacobs, and 'Marilyn Monroe Confidential: An Intimate Personal Account,' which draws on the perspective of Lena Pepitone, who worked as a maid for Monroe.
