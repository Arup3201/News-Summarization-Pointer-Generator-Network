Following on from Grey Thursday and Black Friday comes Cyber Monday - the marketing term given to the Monday after Thanksgiving when retailers offer online deals for customers.

Retailers are hoping customers will be just as enthusiastic about shopping from the comfort of their own homes as they were about finding deals at major retailers over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Starting midnight tonight (or Sunday, in the case of Amazon), retailers will be offering exclusive deals for online shoppers.

Shop online: Cyber Monday has only been around since 2005 but is the biggest shopping day of the year for online retailers

Many online stores are promoting their 
Monday deals, but many big retailers are promoting a 'Cyber Week' and 
rolling out new deals every day through until next weekend.

There are great deals on appliances, televisions, gaming consoles, laptops and tablets through Amazon and Best Buy, and discounts on clothing and shoes from many major retailers.

Deal News reported that last year, 32 per cent of clothing and apparel were marked down as either an 'Editorâ€™s Choice' or priced at the lowest prices on Cyber Monday compared to their prices during any other day of the year.

Cyber
 Monday was started in 2005 by a retail trade group keen to get a slice 
of the festive season spending, to encourage people to shop online the 
Monday after Thanksgiving.  

It's quickly become one of the biggest online shopping days of the year.

In 2012, Cyber Monday saw a 17 per cent increase in sales from 2011, totaling $1.465 billion in sales.

AMAZON: The online marketplace plans to offer new 'lightning deals' every 10 minutes all week and is already offering deals including a Samsung 46-inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV for $477.99, jewelry at up to 70 per cent off and 30 per cent off many tablets and laptops. amazon.com

WALMART: The retail giant is is offering 200 deals on its website each day until Friday, free shipping on all orders over $35 and big ticket items heavily discounted, such as PS4 bundles at $517 and XBox One bundles at $559. walmart.com

TOYS 'R' US: Get Christmas wrapped up with up to 50 per cent off action figures,  up to 30  per cent off bikes and scooters, up to 50 per cent off audio electronics and musical instruments and more.

Gap Inc.: Gap and Banana 
Republic are offering 40 per cent off  Old Navy and Piperlime are 
offering 30 per cent off online with free shipping on orders over $50.

Online experts recommend shoppers exercise caution in the Cyber Monday buying frenzy.

According
 to Digital Trends, shoppers should never partake of a little online spending
 via a public wifi network, such as in a Starbucks, as public 
connections are big targets for criminals after personal information.

It's also recommended that shoppers buy only from retailers that you know and trust - because if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
