It took a lot of planning and manpower to build Westminster Abbey and St Pancras station. And 22 years of labour went into constructing the Taj Mahal.

But now, you too can achieve the same, in a fraction of the time... out of Lego.

Warren Elsmore, one of the very few professional Lego builders in Britain, has designed a series of cityscapes remade in miniature.

These include St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (20,000 bricks); the Taj Mahal (28,000); and the Empire State Building (13,000).

Mr Elsmore's book shows you how to build mini marvels, such as this 20,000-Lego brick version of St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow

The original Taj Mahal, in Agra, India, took 22 years to build. This one should take just several hundred hours

To help fellow enthusiasts, he has written a manual, Brick City: Lego For Grown-Ups - which reveals how to make mini versions of Buckingham Palace, the Eiffel Tower, the Lincoln Memorial and also street scenes of Amsterdam, to name but a few.

One of his masterpieces - St Pancras Station and Hotel - was unveiled yesterday and will be on display at Waterstones bookshop in Piccadilly, central London, for a month.

The 180,000-brick model is 5ft long and 5ft high - and includes six Eurostar platforms, complete with working trains.

The 36-year-old AFOL (that's 'adult fan 
of Lego') has even left part of the building exposed to show details 
such as commuters running down escalators and a guest in a hotel bath.

The building, which took 500 hours to make, was a two-year labour of love for Mr Elsmore, who gave up his job as an IT consultant half a year ago.

He is now one of only three or four adults who have a full-time job making structures from the plastic bricks.

Just last week, Mr Elsmore was paid £1,500 for making an 18in-long corporate logo out of Lego - and charges up to £25,000 for replicas of monumental buildings, such as the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur. Not bad for 300 hours' work.

And if you're wondering where he buys the materials to create his intricate artworks, the answer is simple.

'I buy my Lego from the same outlets as you do. Occasionally I pop down to Argos,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Another source he uses is bricklink.com - an online marketplace where people trade around 200million different types of Lego parts.

As well as long-term projects geared towards adults, Mr Elsmore's book also caters for children.

His guide shows how a 10-year-old can make a red London telephone box, Hong Kong junk or New York taxi in about an hour.

And the key to thinking the Lego way? Imagination.

'The only restriction is your imagination. You really can build anything you like,' he said.

Brick City: Lego for Grown-Ups is published by Mitchell Beazley.
