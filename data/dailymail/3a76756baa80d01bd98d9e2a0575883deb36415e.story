Serena Williams finally conquered the nerves that have wrecked her year when she beat Kaia Kanepi 6-3, 6-3 to reach the US Open quarter-finals.

It is the first time the world No 1 has reached the last eight of a Grand Slam tournament this year, as she seeks the one title that would match Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova’s haul of 18 majors.

The 32-year-old could not hide her delight, shouting, ‘I finally made a quarter-final’, during an on-court interview after the match. 

Barrier: Serena Williams moved into the last eight of a grand slam for the first time this year

Routine: The American beat Estonia's Kaia Kanepi 6-3, 6-3 on Monday at Flushing Meadows

She said: ‘I just relaxed and told myself, “Whatever happens, you are still in the doubles”.

‘I just love this city, and maybe that’s why when I get to New York I always play well.’

She now faces Italy’s Flavia Pennetta, the No 11 seed, who beat Casey Dellacqua 7-5, 6-2.
