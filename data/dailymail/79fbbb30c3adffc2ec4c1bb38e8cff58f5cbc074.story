A 77-year-old American man was killed when a small plane crashed near New Providence Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday.

The crash also injured the 10 other people on board who have been hospitalized. Their conditions were not immediately known.

Police have not yet identified the man who died or his hometown, but initial reports from Bahamas Press said he died of a heart attack.

The 10 survivors, including one child, were rescued by a team from the nearby Stuart Cove’s Aqua Adventures and taken by ambulance to Doctors Hospital in Nassau

Superintendent Paul Rolle said the 10-seat Navajo Chieftain went down after departing the nearby island of Eleuthera on Tuesday morning at approximately 8am. 

The plane was operated by Ferguson Air and was serving as a charter for Southern Air.

Police told the Bahamas Press that the pilot was Rufus Ferguson and that he survived.

Ferguson alerted officials that he was having problems and tried getting the plane close to shallow water before it lost power some 550 feet (170 meters) from the coast near Clifton Pier in western New Providence. 

Pilot Rufus Ferguson, who survived, was flying the plane when it went down near New Providence Island, according to local reports

The 10 survivors, including one child, were rescued by a team from the nearby Stuart Cove’s Aqua Adventures and taken by ambulance to Doctors Hospital in Nassau, according to Bahamas newspaper The Tribune.

They were four Bahamians and six Americans, according to reports. 

Officials said the twin-engine plane was heading from Governor's Harbour, Eleuthera to the Lynden Pindling International Airport when it went down. 

Early reports said the plane, operated by Southern Air, may have lost an engine. The wreckage sank after impact according to Bahamas Press.

The crash was the second fatal plane incident in a month in the Bahamas. 

In early November, Dr Myles Munroe, Bahamas' most famous minister, and eight others died in an accident, believed to have been caused by turbulent weather.

Munroe was traveling in the Lear 36 Executive Jet with his wife Ruth and several members of their Evangelical congregation to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized.

As the pilot attempted to land in Freeport, the aircraft careered into a shipping container crane, killing everyone on board.
