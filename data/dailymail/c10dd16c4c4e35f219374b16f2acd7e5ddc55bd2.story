 that day for five more years, Larry was the center of so many fun,

 my heart forever.

'Amidst
 a whirlwind of big laughs, big smiles and unrestrained personality 
Larry was always, simply Larry. You couldn't fault him for it, it was 
just who he was. I am so thankful that this past year I was able to 
spend time with him and experience yet again "Larry" in all his Big 
Texas bravado.'
