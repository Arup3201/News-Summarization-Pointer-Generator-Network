The father of the late star of the Fast and Furious franchise, Paul Walker, is reportedly suing the family of the man he died with, over $1.8 million of exotic cars he says his son owned.

Walker died along with his friend, Roger Rodas, in November 2013, when a Porsche Carrera GT driven by Rodas skidded off the road at over 100mph and burst into flames.

Walker, 40, and Rodas, were co-owners in the Always Evolving car shop in Valencia, and the actor was said to have amassed a collection of over 30 cars.

Paul Walker Sr has reportedly demanded the return of $1.8 million worth of cars, or the cash equivalent, immediately, and that he has filed court papers seeking to resolve the issue, according to TMZ.

According to the website Mr Walker Sr claims the estate of Rodas, is in possession of numerous vehicles belonging to his son. And that the cars were all fully or partially owned by him.

Rodas' family are said to have already rejected the claim, which will now be resolved by a judge.

Following Walker's death it was reported that his extensive car collection was to be sold-off in a sale arranged by Always Evolving and his estate.

The sales and Walker's connection to the cars was not well publicised as it was thought the estate didn't want money off the back of the tragedy.

Walker's collection was believed to include several late-model BMW's, Audis, Porches and a number of Ford Mustangs.

In May it was reported that sales of the cars had already begun through private brokers.

In the lead-up to the anniversary of his son's death, Mr Walker Sr, said not a day goes by that he doesn't think about his son.

In an interview with E! News he said: 'I miss talking to him a great deal. 

'He had a good heart.' 

The father of the late actor recalled the many laughs the family shared in the  movie star's childhood home in Southern California, saying there were 'a lot of practical jokes'.

Walker left behind his younger brothers Cody and Caleb, and 16-year-old daughter Meadow.

During years past for Thanksgiving, Paul Sr. said the Into The Blue actor would humbly pose for photos with neighbors but often eschewed the attention that comes with celebrity.

'He didn't like the limelight,' he said. 'Paul said one time, ''I really don't like this business, but I can do a lot of good with the money I make.''

He added: 'Paul just radiated love and you can't fake that. Paul had a really good heart. I thought, 'How did I deserve such a wonderful son?''
