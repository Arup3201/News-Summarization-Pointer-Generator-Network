She was deprived of food and air for several days, but Olive is wagging her tail again after rescuers removed a plastic jar from her head.

Michigan Humane Department officials said the three-year-old Chow mix could have suffocated or starved to death if a neighbor didn't spot her in an abandoned Detroit home and call for help.

'She (Olive) wasn’t happy about it…she didn’t 
know what was going on,' Humane Society Rescue Driver Chris Ouwerkerk, who saved Olive, said.

He added: 'Once I got her outside, 
with her adrenaline rushing and her being scared, she was breathing 
really heavy, and you could hear the plastic jug - it was sucking the 
sides in and they would pop out, so it was making some noise.'

Ouwerkerk filmed the rescue, and MHS shared the heart wrenching video on YouTube.

The kindhearted rescue driver said Olive panicked when she saw him approach and disappeared upstairs.

When he found the terrified pup, he got her on a control stick and walked her outside.

He said the clear, plastic jar was too difficult to remove, so he poked some holes in it to give the dog air.

Officials don't know how the jar ended up on Olive's head.

Back at the shelter a short time later, an animal officer carefully removed using lubricant.

'You’re not going to believe the look of relief on Olive’s face after the jar came sliding off of her head,' the humane society recounted on their website.

'It is a look and feeling that was shared by everyone at the shelter that day.

'She was finally free to eat, drink and breathe.'

After going through treatment for heartworm disease, Olive is now awaiting 'a special and understanding adopter' to give her a 'forever home'

'She is a fun, loving dog,' Ouwerkerk said.

'It doesn’t take her very long, but she does open up and she warms up to people, and then she is all about that person.'
