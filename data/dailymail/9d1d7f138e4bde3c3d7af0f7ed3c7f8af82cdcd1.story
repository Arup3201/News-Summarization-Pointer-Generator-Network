At 15-years-old, most people's biggest worry is what they will wear to the school disco.

But by this age Ruth Pearcey had been battling bone cancer for years - and was now faced with a decision about whether to have her leg amputated in order to beat the disease. 

The now 21-year-old was diagnosed with bone cancer when she was 12, and had already beaten the disease once.

When it came back a second time, she was told she only had a five per cent chance of survival if she kept her leg.

She chose to make a huge sacrifice, and have an above the knee leg amputation in order to save her life.

Ten years later, she says the gamble paid off as she is finally cancer free and enjoying life.

Ruth Pearcey, 21, decided to have her leg amputated when she was 15, after doctors said without it she only had a five per cent chance of surviving bone cancer. She is pictured, left, with her prosthetic leg, and right, at her brother's wedding, before her leg was removed

Ms Pearcey had battled bone cancer since she was 12. In 2008, her kidneys failed due to intensive cancer treatment (she is pictured during chemotherapy), and doctors said she had just 24 hours to live. Luckily she was able to recover - and attended her brother's wedding days later

Now, ten years later, Ms Pearcey said having her leg removed was the right choice. She said: 'Thankfully the amputation prevented the cancer from returning and I have finally been able to move on with my life'

She is now sharing her story to raise awareness for Ewing's sarcoma, the rare form of bone cancer she suffered.

Ms Pearcey, from Leeds, said: 'I was given the ultimate sacrifice, lose your leg or your life.

'It was heart-breaking at 15-years-old to have to make such a life-changing decision but I wasn't ready to die.

'Losing my leg would increase my chances of survival and I was willing to try anything to survive.

'Thankfully the amputation prevented the cancer from returning and I have finally been able to move on with my life.'

Ms Pearcey first noticed a lump on her leg at the age of 12, it was painful and caused her to limp.

She said: 'I enjoyed playing football but the pain was unbearable.

'My parents took me to the doctors and they thought it was an infection so I was prescribed with antibiotics but the lump didn't budge.

'It took three visits to our GP before I was given a life-saving X-ray and that was only because my mum had asked for one.

'I was diagnosed with aggressive bone cancer after having a biopsy of my tumour.

Last year Ms Pearcey was finally given the 'all clear', after being in remission for five years

It was first discovered Ms Pearcey had cancer when she began to limp, and found playing football painful. She endured gruelling chemotherapy and surgery throughout her teenage years

She underwent rounds of gruelling chemotherapy as well as surgery to remove the tumour on her leg.

She was in remission for just under two years when the lump on her leg reappeared.

'I knew straight away that my cancer was back, I was petrified,' Ms Pearcey said.

'I was older this time around and I knew the seriousness of my condition, I was also devastated about the thought of losing my hair again.'

In June 2008, Ruth was given just 24-hours to live after her kidneys began to fail due to invasive cancer treatment.

Luckily she survived and was able to attend her brother's wedding just days later – when hospital staff allowed her out for the day.

She said: 'I was on dialysis after my kidneys failed but I beat the odds and my kidneys recovered.

'I was faced with an amputation a few months later and that was the scariest part of my cancer journey.'

Doctors told Ruth that without having her leg amputated that she would have just five per cent chance of beating cancer.

She needed to have her leg amputated to improve her chances of making a full recovery.

Ms Pearcey added: 'My supportive friends and family helped me make the decision, I needed my leg removed.

Ms Pearcey had to learn to walk again with a prosthetic leg. But she can now look forward to the future without worrying about cancer, she says

'When I woke up from my operation I was worried about the future but losing my leg gave me my life back.

'I was finally given the all clear last year after five years in remission.

'I can now look forward to the future without worrying about cancer every day.'

Ms Pearcey has been supported throughout her cancer journey by the Bone Cancer Research Trust and The Teenage Cancer Trust.

Julie Harrington, chief executive of the Bone Cancer Research Trust, said: 'Ruth is an absolute star and has shown nothing but incredible bravery, strength and positivity since her diagnosis.

'She has overcome the odds with dignity and courage and her story will no doubt inspire others who are battling cancer.

'Primary bone cancer is brutal disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year.

'Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars.

'It is the third biggest cancer killer in young adults and children and it is only through research and awareness that we can change these devastating statistics to help people like Ruth - now and in the future.'
