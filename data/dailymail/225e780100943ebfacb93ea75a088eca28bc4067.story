Dr Anthony Madu made thousands by working as a locum when he was also receiving sick pay

A doctor faces a potential jail term for secretly moonlighting in other jobs while claiming more than £29,000 in sick pay from his own hospital.

Dr Anthony Madu, 45, carried out well-paid locum work at other hospitals around the country while on sick leave from his job with the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in Wales.

NHS bosses had to pay £20,000 to other doctors to cover Madu, meaning the bill for his dishonesty came to around £50,000.

He was convicted of six counts of fraud today and was remanded in custody until he can be sentenced next month.

Madu was given the specialist registrar obstetrics gynaecology post at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in August 2009.

But he was suspended two months later over allegations about his conduct towards other staff and claims he had falsified his training record, the court heard.

From January 2010, he then submitted sick notes on three different occasions, saying he could not work because of stress.

Madu then made 'tens of thousands of pounds' while working for Sandwell General Hospital in Birmingham as well as Scarborough General Hospital and The Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester, the jury heard.

Prosecutor Christian Jowett said: 'He was legally obliged to tell his employers about his work but he did not do so.

'He was also legally obliged to tell two locum agencies that he was on extended leave and had been granted sickness leave.

'But he continued to work and receive payment from both Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and his work in England.

'This was a very costly business for the NHS and very lucrative for Dr Madu - that's why he did it. Madu had been irresponsible as well as dishonest.'

The prosecution said the total cost to the Welsh NHS for covering his absence was £49,000 and Madu received more than £100,000 for working as a locum and £29,000 in sick pay.

He was convicted of failing to declare to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CVUHB) he had taken secondary employment, that he had failed to tell two different agencies, Medacs and JCJ, he had been signed off sick and that he did not declare to either agency he had been suspended.

Remanding Madu in custody at Cardiff Crown Court today, Judge David Wynn Morgan said: 'It may well be a tragedy has been avoided by the timely actions by the health board.' Madu will be sentenced on November 28.

Madu was previously criticised as an 'unimpressive witness' and 'unreliable' by a coroner investigating the death of a newborn baby

It emerged today that Madu was taken on by the Cardiff and Vale health board just weeks after he was involved in the care of a first-time mum whose baby Mikhael was born unresponsive and died 11 days later.

An inquest into baby Mickael Morales was not held until October 2012 when a coroner ruled that his death was caused by his mother Sheryl Morales being given too much of a drug during her labour at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

Madu, a locum doctor on duty at the Royal Bolton at the time, had said he could not remember signing the prescription for the drug - but investigators said the signature was definitely his.

At the hearing, Assistant coroner Kevin McLaughlin singled Madu out for criticism saying he was an 'unimpressive witness' and 'largely unreliable'.

The Bolton hospital apologised to the baby's parents Sheryl and Leonard Morales.

Madu is currently suspended by the General Medical Council, which has been engaged in a long-running investigation into him.

High court papers show that the GMC has accused him of misrepresenting his postgraduate training record, behaving inappropriately to colleagues and patients, working in medicine in breach of previously imposed restrictions and failing to co-operate with investigations.

Madu has contested all the allegations made by the GMC.
