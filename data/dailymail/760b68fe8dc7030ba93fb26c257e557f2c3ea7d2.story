A letter written by a passenger on the Titanic describing the 'wonderful passage' - hours before the ship hit an iceberg - has sold at auction for £119,000 ($200,000).

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said the handwritten note was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder at an auction in Devizes, western England, on Saturday.

The price, which includes a fee known as the buyer's premium, topped the pre-sale estimate of £100,000 ($168,000).

Last missive: The envelope of a letter written by Esther Hart and her seven-year-old daughter Eva as they sailed aboard RMS Titanic in April 1912, shortly before the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean

The letter was written by second-class passenger Esther Hart on April 14, 1912. 'The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now,' she said in the note to family in England.

Hours later the passenger liner described as 'practically unsinkable' hit an iceberg and sank, killing more than 1,500 people.

Hart was among about 700 survivors.

Sinking feeling: The 'unsinkable' ship sunk after hitting an iceberg on the same day Esther Hart penned a letter to her mother

Survivors: Esther and Eva Hart survived, and so did Esther's letter, because her husband put the letter inside the pocket of his coat which he gave to his wife to keep warm, giving exquisite details about the voyage aboard the ill-fated Titanic

The handwritten note on White Star Line notepaper was tucked inside the pocket of a sheepskin coat Hart's husband Benjamin gave her as he put Esther and their daughter Eva in a lifeboat.

The family had been traveling from England to Canada, where they planned to settle.

The letter was intended for Esther Hart's mother in Chadwell Heath, east London.

In it, Hart wrote that the family was enjoying the journey, and that they expected to arrive at their destination early.

According to auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, it's the only known letter to have been written aboard the ship on the day it hit the iceberg.

The letter includes a postscript from Eva Hart, then aged seven: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva.'

Benjamin Hart was among passengers and crew killed when the ship sank. Esther and Eva were rescued, along with some 700 others.

Memorabilia: The handwritten letter was expected to sell for up to 100,000 pounds (US $168,000) but fetched even more at 119,000 pounds (U.S. $200,000)

Esther Hart died in 1928. Eva Hart, who died in 1996, became a prominent Titanic survivor, critical of attempts to salvage the ship, which she considered a mass grave. She described the voyage, and her mother's letter, in an autobiography, 'Shadow of the Titanic.'

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said the letter was 'quite simply the jewel in the crown of Titanic manuscript ephemera.'

Fascination with the Titanic remains strong a century after the disaster, and prices for memorabilia from the ship have soared in recent years. In October a violin believed to have been played as the doomed vessel sank sold for more than £1 million.
