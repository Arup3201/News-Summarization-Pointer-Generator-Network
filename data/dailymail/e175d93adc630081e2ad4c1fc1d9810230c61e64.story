Gunned down: Devon Scarlett, 34, was chased into a dead end in Brixton, south London, and blasted twice at close range, it is claimed

A man was gunned down and beaten up as he lay dying from bullet wounds for 'disrespecting' a man he had never met before in McDonald’s, a court heard today.

Devon Scarlett, 34, was chased into a dead end in Brixton, south London, and blasted twice at close range, it is claimed.

He was then punched and kicked as he lay bleeding to death from bullet wounds to his thigh and stomach.

Alleged gunman Horace Campbell, 27, told the victim: ‘You’re not so hot now’ before calmly walking away.

Jurors heard that the dispute started at the end of a night out at around 6am on April 17 last year.

Mr Scarlett, who also used the name Raymond Mitchell, entered the McDonalds in Brixton Road within minutes of Campbell, who had just left the Fridge bar.

The pair squared up to each other after Mr Scarlett intervened in a loud argument between a group of men in the restaurant, it is claimed.

Campbell then phoned 18 year-old Liam Douglas-O’Callaghan, who arrived minutes later with a loaded handgun, jurors were told.

Witnesses saw all three man ‘wrestling’ in Marcus Garvey Way shortly before hearing shots fired.

One neighbour woke up to hear a voice shouting ‘Shoot him, shoot him,’ while another heard the victim say: ‘Oh my God, he’s got a gun, he’s going to shoot me.’

Campbell was seen to pull out a gun and shoot Mr Scarlett at close range, it is claimed.

Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema told the court: ‘Devon Scarlett remained on his feet at first but Liam O’Callaghan pushed him to the ground and punched him in the face.

‘Horace Campbell then kicked him while he was down on the ground. He then hit Devon Scarlett on the front of his head with the gun before both of these men left.’

Neighbours came out of their homes to find the victim lying on the ground holding his stomach and saying: ‘He shot me.’

One bullet damaged the left femoral artery in his thigh near his groin and the other passed through his intestine.

Mr Scarlett was taken to hospital for emergency surgery but died at 12.25pm.

A carrier bag found in the road - said to be used to bring the gun to the scene - bore a fingerprint matching Douglas-O’Callaghan, jurors were told.

Both Campbell and O’Callaghan now admit they were present at the scene but claim that Devon Scarlett had the gun.

‘They will assert that it was Devon Scarlett who tried to shoot the two defendants and while they struggled the shots missed them and hit him,’ said Miss Cheema.

‘Effectively “He shot himself” is what the defence will be.’

Miss Cheema added: ‘It is the prosecution case that Horace Campbell was determined to avenge the perceived lack of respect that Devon Scarlett showed him.

‘Devon Scarlett acted with foolish bravado, behaving like a tough guy, but whatever he said and did he was not armed.

‘He was the one who walked away, an unarmed man who had probably run all the way down that cul-de-sac when he saw that the gun had arrived.’

Campbell, of Anerley, southeast London, and Douglas-O’Callaghan, of Tulse Hill, southwest London, both deny murder.

The trial continues.
