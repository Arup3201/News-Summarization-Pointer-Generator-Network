A First World War bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a Belgian battlefield.Â 

The bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of Flanders battlegrounds, killing two and injuring two more.

Johan Lescrauwaert of the Ypres prosecutor's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914-1918 war exploded near the workers, but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade.

It was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell, but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more

The circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents

Every year the battlefields in western Belgium throw up hundreds of armaments from the Great War, and most are destroyed without incident by a special Belgian army bomb squad.

In a nearby city, the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters.

More and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former Flanders field battleground

Evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells, as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life, although this case was peculiar because no digging took place

The Flanders battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with German forces for most of the war.

Earlier this year, members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in Ypres, Northwestern Belgium.

Also earlier this month, a large amount of ammunition from the First World War was discovered on the border of the West Flemish municipalities of Passchendaele and Moorslede, for which the Belgian bomb squad is still working to clean up the site

Earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in Ypres, Belgium, were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a WWI-era bomb before it exploded

The unexploded bomb from January 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month
