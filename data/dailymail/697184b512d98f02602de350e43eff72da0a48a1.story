A family of three from Ohio died on Monday morning when their light aircraft crashed at a popular Colorado ski area.

James and Amy Kerker had been flying with their six-year-old son Lucas to Moab in Utah for a vacation when the plane went down.

Witnesses described how the plane burst into flames after crashing into ski lifts at the Loveland resort when it tried to cross the Continental Divide.Â

A couple from Ohio and their six-year-old son were killed in the plane crash at Loveland Ski Area on Tuesday

The Kerker family, from Raymond, Ohio, reportedly left Rocky Mountain Airport in Broomfield at 8:10 a.m. They crashed a short time later at Loveland Ski Area's Loveland Valley beginner area

Mr Kerker, 43, is believed to have been flying the aircraft at the time. Early indications suggest that the plane didn't have enough power to clear the mountains, then crashed when he tried to turn back.

Also on board were his 39-year-old wife Amy and the couple's son, who suffered from the rare and terminal disease ataxia telangiectasia.

In a moving YouTube video the couple had made to explain their son's diagnosis in 2011, they had said they were dedicated to filling his life with new experiences.

With only 500 children in the U.S. suffering from the disease, and most patients not living past their 20th birthday, the couple had said it was their 'mission in life to make every day count' for him.

'We can't imagine our lives without him,' his parents had stated on the video, as they explained how the disorder would rob their son of the ability to walk and talk properly and leave him susceptible to childhood cancers.

In a final Facebook post on Saturday, Ms Kerker had said: 'Listening to Conway Twitty classics driving through the Rocky Mountains...could only be better if we had some John Denver.'

The advanced pediatric surgery nurse was praised by colleagues at Nationwide Children's Hospital who were shocked and saddened to learn of her death.

Deb Pratt, director for advance practice nursing, said: 'Amy was dedicated to our patients and families throughout her years of outstanding service.

'Amy was one of the initial nurse practitioners in Pediatric Surgery who helped build the excellent program we have today.

'She was known for her advocacy for her patients and families - she routinely went above and beyond to see that their needs and concerns were addressed.'

Medical staff she had worked alongside, and parents of children she had helped to treat, left tributes for the nurse on social media sites.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating what caused the Piper aircraft to crash shortly after it left Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield.

Adventure: Lucas and his parents had been flying to Utah over the Continental Divide when their plane crashed

Aviation
 expert Greg Feith told 9 News that the mountain and surrounding ski area sometimes created tricky flying conditions that pilots from out of state struggled to navigate.

He added that many pilots run into difficulty because they try to follow the highway and then realize their planes haven't got enough lift to clear the Eisenhower Tunnel.

Hiker Rico Argentati watched as the plane tried to turn before crashing.

' I just stopped to take a break, and I heard this plane coming up the valley. I knew right away it was too low,' he said.

'It tried to turn around. It made a 180-degree turn to the left, and it dropped below the ridge ... I was hoping it would come over the ridge, and it didn't. It crashed just on the other said of the ridge, and I saw a huge plume of smoke coming up.'
