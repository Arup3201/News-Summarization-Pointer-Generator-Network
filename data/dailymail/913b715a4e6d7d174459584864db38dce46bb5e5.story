Read Charlie's Sale story on the real reasons behind Kevin Pietersen's sacking by England

Paul Downton has admitted the ECB should have handled the fallout surrounding Kevin Pietersen’s sacking better than they did – but insisted it was the right decision.

Speaking for the first time since the confidentiality agreement between Pietersen and the ECB ended in October, Downton played down Pietersen’s claims of dressing-room bullying, and said his ‘only driving force is what’s best for English cricket’.

Pushed to explain why the ECB had sacked Pietersen – who was released on Monday by his IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils – following the Ashes whitewash almost a year ago, England’s managing director said: ‘All one has to do is read Kevin’s book to see how disaffected he was.

Paul Downton says the right decision was made regarding Kevin Pietersen but it should have been dealt with a lot better by the ECB

Kevin Pietersen heavily criticised former team-mate Matt Prior in his autobiography

‘I don’t think you’ll ever be able to explain to some people’s satisfaction what happened. I can repeat what we said at the time, which was that people felt Kevin had become disengaged from the side, and that we needed more from our leaders.

‘I’m sure we could have handled it better. But it’s history. We can’t change it any more. My only driving force here is what’s best for English cricket. Am I content that we made the right decision? Absolutely.’

The ECB hierarchy have come under fierce criticism in some quarters for their failure to comment on some of Pietersen’s claims in his incendiary autobiography – not least the suggestion that there was a culture of bullying within the dressing-room.

Downton said: ‘You can go on denying all sorts of things. The reality was that there is no formal complaint of bullying on anyone’s record during that whole period.

‘We all know it was a surprise in terms of how Kevin portrayed that environment. None of the other players recognise it.

‘I’m passionate about English cricket going forward. I cannot see any reason to be going over old ground, because it’s not relevant any more. I’m sure I made mistakes at the time, but it is what it is.’

Pietersen didn't hold back in his autobiography, with many controversial comments made throughout

Downton drew on the positives English cricket has made since the Ashes debacle earlier this year

Meanwhile, Downton stressed the positive gains English cricket had made since the Ashes car-crash, and said he would be ‘very surprised’ if Alastair Cook were not confirmed as England’s captain for the World Cup at Friday’s selection meeting.

Though he doesn’t have a say on team matters, Downton revealed that Cook’s one-day leadership had been approved only after a week of ‘kicking the tyres’ by the selectors in September, but said he thought Cook remained the right man to lead England at the World Cup.

‘He’s having a terrible time at the moment,’ he said. ‘No one knows that more than him. But we are playing a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with two new balls, where his track record is good, and he’s been captain for three and a half years.

‘The only time he really had a full-strength side, they got to the final of the Champions Trophy and frankly should have won it. Yes, he’s in miserable form, but form can change.

‘And just as we saw during the summer, when frankly AN Other was going to be the next captain for England, we felt strongly that all his experience, all his toughness would come out.

‘The fact is he’s a remarkably strong guy. His track record says he will score runs. Everybody goes through a bad period. But I’ve got to think that his form’s got to turn.’
