An eight-year-old who suffers from autism, has transformed from a 'painfully awkward, isolated' boy into an outgoing chatterbox, thanks to his beloved rescue dog.

In just two months, the Staffordshire terrier mix has made Jonny Hickey 'the happiest child that I've ever seen him be,' according to his mother Linda.

Jonny, from John's creek, Georgia, barely spoke before meeting Xena. He spent hours playing marbles on his own and was terrified of new experiences.

Xena is said to have transformed Jonny's personality. The rescue dog was adopted by the Hickey family two months ago. She was being cared for by animal services at the time

Xena had suffered from extreme neglect when she was found. Here, she weighs four pounds and is unable to stand

Xena fought for survival, earning her nickname Warrior Puppy. She was found unconscious but responded when given fluids and food. Cruelty charges are being investigated

Jonny had had difficulty showing affection and was uncomfortable making eye contact. Since Xena has come into his life, he has become tactile and expressive. He cuddles and kisses the terrier

The pair have developed a special relationship since they met two months ago when the family adopted the puppy.

Since then, Jonny has transformed into an affectionate, happy boy who considers Xena his best friend.

Video footage of the pair shows Jonny singing You've Got a Friend In Me with Xena on his lap.

In another clip, he said that he and Xena make a 'pretty perfect team' and kisses the rescue puppy on the top of his head.

Mother-of-two Linda Hickey, 44, said in an interview with Today.com: 'These two were destined to be together, to save each other at a
 level that humans just can’t understand.'

'From the very first day, that dog was 
sitting in his lap in the car seat, giving him all these kisses. And that’s where she’s been ever since,' she said.

The part-time preschool teacher said her son now chatters non-stop, telling her about his day at school.

Xena was brought to an animal shelter
 in Georgia at the end of last year after she collapsed in someone's 
yard.

The four-month-old was scarred and emaciated after being dumped in
 a cage.

Staff at the 
DeKalb County Animal Services' shelter in Georgia said Xena weighed four
 pounds and was close to death, according to Today.com.

Chrissy
 Kaczynski, from Animal Services said in 12 years of working with rescue
 dogs, Xena was one of the worst cases she had come across.

The puppy's rapid recovery led to her nickname Xena the Warrior.

Mrs Hickey found the dog on her Facebook page and met her at a fundraising event last November.

She described the connection between Xena and her son as instantaneous.

Xena was dehydrated and emaciated when she was brought to animal services

Life has improved in the past few months for both Jonny and Xena, who are inseparable

Xena, the Warrior Puppy has found a very happy home with Linda Hickey, 44 and her husband Grant, 50. They own two other dogs, but said they are too old to play with their son

In just two months, Xena and Jonny has become the best of friends. The Hickey family say they can't imagine life without their new pet

Tributes to Xena and her family are posted on her Facebook group. The Hickey family post regular updates on Xena and Jonny to improve awareness for autism and cruelty towards animals

Regualar picture updates on Xena's Facebook group show there is an abundance of love and affection in the Hickey household.

Jonny and his best friend are rarely without one another. The benefits of a calming animal on autistic children are being researched

'We were literally there for four 
minutes and Xena ran right up to Jonny and my husband. I 
already loved this dog, and after I met her, I really loved this dog.'

Research on the effects of companion animals on children with autism spectrum disorder, shows they are more likely to talk and laugh in the presence of guinea pigs than in the presence of toys.

Autism Service Dogs of America pairs children with specially trained dogs that have a calming effect. Mrs Hickey posts regular updates to Xena's Facebook group and has made a series of videos to support Autism Awareness Month and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month.'My name is Jonny and this is my puppy, Xena,' he says in the video, as his pup rests near him with a supportive paw on his lap.

'Well, my Xena was hurt really bad by some not-so-nice people. And I have autism. So I think we make a pretty perfect team to spread the words to be nice to animals, and nice to kids like me.'
