One half of a pair of intruders who stormed a suburban home wielding a gun and demanding money from the occupants has been arrested and charged over the terrifying crime.

A huge police operation took place in Whalan in Sydney's west on Thursday following the invasion on Wendesday evening about 11.30pm.

Officers said the man and woman - who has now been arrested - allegedly threatened the two people at the Madang Street home with a gun before firing a shot into their television.
