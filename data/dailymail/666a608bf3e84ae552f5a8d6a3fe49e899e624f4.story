Brendan Foster is posing for pictures on Gateshead quayside with a group of children whose parents were possibly not born when he was Britain’s best, winning our only track and field medal of the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

The long sideburns are gone, stubble shaved and the unkempt mane of dark hair is grey and brushed. His off-white cotton running vests — which back then revealed thick tufts of chest hair — are stored away, replaced by a smart navy blue suit and tie.

This is Foster the businessman, the raconteur who can pick up the phone to Sting, Ant and Dec, or Alastair Campbell to ask a favour.

One in a million: Foster, who had the idea for the Great North Run, is celebrating the event's millionth runner 

Best known as the distinctive Geordie voice of athletics, Foster is most proud of his days as a brave frontrunner. He gritted it out in an era where systematic doping was as much a part of track and field as running spikes.

But perhaps what will prove his greatest legacy is written in giant lettering on the Tyne Bridge, just behind him as he poses for pictures. 

Great North Run Million’ reads the sign. The event, which Foster conceived of during a twilight run on an Auckland beach with his friend Dave Moorcroft, will pass its one-millionth runner on Sunday.

More than 56,000 will set off from the heart of Newcastle for the 34th edition of the biggest mass participation sport event in the world. The New York marathon will be second to reach a million and the London marathon follows in two years.

‘We didn’t realise until we started doing the numbers,’ recalls Foster. ‘Then we got in touch with all the other major events and said to them, “So how many have you got?” If you’re from Newcastle, you don’t really beat New York in anything, so it’s a proud moment for the North East.’

Back then: Foster ran as an amateur and says he feels sorry for modern, professional athletes

Foster looks out from the glass-fronted Sage Gateshead building, the heart of Tyneside’s arts scene, and gestures to the landscape that has made him tick down the years.

From behind modern tower blocks peeks the upper tier of St James’s Park, where, since he was seven, many happy and some despondent afternoons have been spent cheering his beloved Newcastle United. He ran on the riverbanks as a teenager, while part of Gateshead Harriers.

Trained by a local welder, Stan Long, Foster became Britain’s best long-distance runner before the public had heard of Seb Coe, Steve Ovett or Steve Cram. A chemistry teacher, he broke world records over two miles and 3,000 metres. 

‘When I broke the (two-mile) world record at Crystal Palace in 1973 I was teaching (at St Joseph’s Grammar School in Hebburn),’ he says. ‘There were guys who were joiners, carpenters, welders and bank workers. Eventually you got a few quid but it was nothing more than pocket money.

‘I feel sorry for some professional athletes now because if they don’t run fast they can’t pay their mortgage. We were less conventional, we didn’t have to do good interviews or thank the sponsors.’

Foster was adored for his no-nonsense northern attitude, which drew comparisons with a series of 1970s cartoons titled ‘Tough of The Track.’ The main character Alf Tupper, with his wild looks, bore a resemblance to Foster.

‘Tupper was a typical northern lad. He ate fish and chips, beat the toffs and overcame the establishment. Maybe some I ran against would say I was the tough lad of the track, but it wasn’t about being toughest, just being fastest.’

There are still no airs and graces with Foster. He litters his stories with ‘I should stop, I’m telling you too much,’ but free-flowing honesty is the only way he knows. 

It has made life difficult for him at times in the commentary box, like when he laid into a young Mo Farah after he won a mile race on the same weekend as the Great North Run several years ago, before he made his breakthrough. 

‘I said: “What on earth are you doing? You need to get a proper coach and a new set-up.” He had a hell of a finish, he just didn’t have a clue how to win a race.’

His plain talking is what has made Foster such an enduring broadcaster, having commentated on every major athletics event since 1983. He learned from the peerless David Coleman, who died last year. 

‘He invited me to join him in the commentary box,’ says Foster, ‘I didn’t realise until I sat next to others that I’d been next to a Rolls Royce. If that’s your first car you don’t appreciate it until you’ve had a Ford Escort.’

At last month’s European Championships, Foster was a rare voice on BBC TV to stick up for the French steeplechaser Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad, who was harshly stripped of his gold medal for ripping off his shirt on the final straight while a long way clear.

‘I’ve seen Alan Shearer score and his celebrations were understated,’ says Foster. ‘Just because another goes mental doesn’t mean they should get a prison sentence.

‘The rebel in me liked him ripping his shirt off. Athletics can’t always be a function of how hard you try but it has to be a fair reward for what you’ve achieved. He didn’t get fair reward because he’s a bit crackers. Mo is getting fair reward now for years of unfailing effort.

‘I believe in a meritocracy. I guess it’s based on my history. I lost a gold to a guy who cheated. It doesn’t affect my life but I wish I hadn’t.’

Foster is used to battling against the tide, having competed at a time when athletics was rotten with drugs cheats.

Different era: Foster claims athletics is a much cleaner sport these days than when he was competing

‘The entire nation of East Germany was designed to win medals by fair means or foul,’ he says. ‘A guy I used to run against a lot was (East German) Manfred Kuschmann but we weren’t allowed to speak, we couldn’t swap vests, he was always whisked away after races. 

'I used to go to training with him on my mind but I could never physically get to meet him.Things are a lot better in that regard now, the authorities have taken a stand against drugs. There will always be some but it’s nowhere near as bad.’

After his running career, Foster set up Nova International, a company which holds dozens of mass-participation sport events across the country with more than 200,000 people a year taking part in runs, swims and bike rides.

Now 66, and a grandfather of two, he is still trim and runs four times a week. ‘I go with my mate who lives across the road,’ he says. ‘He’s 75, we’ve been running together for 20 years and have both got progressively slower. It’s hilly where we live so now we walk up the hills and run on the tops.’

He still lives in Newcastle and has a holiday home in the nearby town of Bamburgh. ‘I go to the local butcher to get the meat for the weekend and he’ll ask me what I’ve been up to and it’s lovely.’

Foster believes the region and the North in general is often given short shrift. ‘There’s a significant problem in this country, it’s that London is everything and everywhere else is nothing,’ he says.

By way of example, he recounts a piece of advice given to him by Peter McHugh, then editor of GMTV, about how to raise the profile of the Great North Run.

‘About 15 years ago, it was the biggest event in the country. We had the best athletes and celebrities. I said, “How can we get promotion or on to your programme?” He said: “The best thing you could do is take North out of the title and people in the South will be more receptive”.

‘I was in the same class at school as Peter, he’s a good lad and was giving me proper advice. But that made me even more determined to make it work and make sure everyone knows about it.’

The Bupa Great North Run, televised on BBC, is Britain’s biggest running event. The Nova International event will become the first of its kind to celebrate its one-millionth finish. Visit greatrun.org to find out more.
