Joel Campbell has revealed that he's looking forward to a 'new opportunity' after agreeing to join Villarreal on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season.

Despite being called back to the Arsenal squad after an impressive 2014 World Cup campaign with Costa Rica, Campbell has struggled to find a regular spot in Arsene Wenger's first team and has been used in the Frenchman's deal to bring Gabriel Paulista to the Emirates.

Speaking via his personal video blog, Campbell said: 'This means a lot to me, I am very excited with this new opportunity and I hope to sign the contract tomorrow [Sunday].
