Suing: Former U.S state Senator Michael Katz and his two daughters were injured when a chairlift derailed and they fell 35ft to the ground

A former U.S state Senator is to sue a ski resort after he and his two daughters were injured when a chairlift derailed sending them falling 35ft to the ground.

Former Democratic politician Michael Katz broke his back and suffered a brain injury in the fall at the Sugarloaf Mountain ski resort in Maine in December 2010.

He was one of eight people injured when high winds dislodged a chairlift cable and five cars were sent plummeting to the ground.

He is the only one of those injured to sue according to, as others have settled out of court.

Mr Katz, who is a doctor, is said to have suffered the worst injuries out of those hurt in the incident.

According to the Portland Press Herald,
Mr Katz is seeking unspecified damages and is also suing on behalf of 
his two daughters who were aged 11 and 13 at the time and were also 
hurt.

The 
lawsuit states: 'Abigail was thrown from the chair after impact, while 
Emily was dragged up the mountain by the lift because a piece of Emilyâ€™s
ski equipment was stuck in the chair.

'Abigail and Emily could see their father lying motionless in the snow after the collapse, and their immediate thought was that he had been killed.'

The family say that the resort wa negligent for operating the ski lift even though they were allegedly aware of its safety hazards.

The resort says that it had tried to avoid a court case but that bosses were unsurprised by the legal action.

The lift was an A 2 passenger monocable fixed grip chair manufactured and installed by Borvig in 1975.

It was 4,013 feet long with a vertical of 1,454 feet and moved at a speed of 500 feet per minute.

There were 162 chairs on the lift.

It was removed from the resort shortly after the incident and replaced in December 2011.

Mr Katz only served one term as a Senator before he was defeated at the polls by Republican Greg Lavelle.

Katz's injuries were a source of contention during the election race - his rival accused him of using them as an excuse for missing meetings prompting a furious reaction from Mr katz's camp.

His wife Patricia even recorded a radio advert accusing Mr Lavelle of using a personal tragedy for political gain.

At 4,237 feet, Sugarloaf is Maine's second-highest mountain after Mount Katahdin.
