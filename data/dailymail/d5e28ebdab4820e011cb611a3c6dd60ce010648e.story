An investigation has been launched into the death of a seven-year-old girl shot dead on her doorstep by her estranged father who then turned the gun on himself.

Mary Shipstone was brutally killed on September 11 as she clutched her violin outside her mother's home in Northiam, East Sussex. 

She had been shot by her Egyptian father, Yasser Alromisse, who is thought to have carried out the act as revenge against her mother who had recently turned her back on Islam.

More than two months after their deaths, the East Sussex Local Safeguarding Children Board have called for a review of the case. 

The board will look at how children can be better protected in the future. 

Following the child's death it emerged her mother, Lyndsey Shipstone, had been hiding from her abusive former partner for years. 

The 42-year-old married Alromisse in Liverpool in 2005 and converted to Islam. 

Later she fled with Mary, allegedly begging lawyers not to tell him where they had run to.

On September 11 he appeared outside their house and killed their daughter with 'a terrible bang'. 

By the time police arrived the 45-year-old council worker had turned the gun on himself. 

Speaking after her daughter's death, Miss Shipstone said: ''As soon as I put the front door key in there was a terrible bang behind me. I turned round – and Mary was on the ground.

'I saw her father with the gun in his hand pointing at Mary’s head and he fired a second time, and then he retreated into the car and I just dropped down to Mary and dragged her round the front of the house away from the car.  

Mary's mother Lyndsey is thought to have been hiding from her former partner for years after allegedly turning her back on Islam following the collapse of their marriage 

Concerns have been raised over how the girl's father came to know of their new address in Sussex 

The East Sussex Local Safeguarding Children Board have called for a review of Mary's tragic case 

‘I was screaming for help and I was telling neighbours who were calling the police that he had a gun and Mary had been shot. I realised I had to get her away.’

Mary died in Kings College Hospital in London the following day. 

Concerns were raised over how Almromisse came to learn of the pair's location in September. Sussex Police said it was investigating how the man came to be in the area.
