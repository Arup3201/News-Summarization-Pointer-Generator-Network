Less than half of Britain's rail passengers think the railways are value for money despite train operators celebrating 'record' satisfaction poll results. 

The damning verdict comes after passengers were hit with inflation-busting fare rises in January of up to 10 per cent.

Satisfaction with ‘value for money’ averages a paltry 47 per cent – dropping to just 29 per cent for the lowest scoring train company.

Rated joint worst for value for money are South West Trains (pictured) and Greater Anglia

Up to one in five passengers of the worst performing train companies remain dissatisfied with the overall service they get.

On individual routes, up to a quarter of passengers are unimpressed with services according to the latest satisfaction survey by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus.

Despite this, train companies were celebrating ‘record’ satisfaction ratings overall – although they do admit they ‘must do better.’

Passenger Focus chief executive, Anthony Smith, welcomed improvements but said ‘more needs to be done.'

First Great Western had one of the lowest satisfaction results among customers in London

Rated joint worst for value for money
are South West Trains and Greater Anglia (both 37 per cent), 
Southeastern and First Capital Connect (both 38 per cent), Heathrow 
Express (40 per cent), Southern (42 per cent), c2c (46 per cent), First 
Capital Connect (49 per cent) and Chiltern Railways (50 per cent).

But when broken down to individual routes, the figures are even more shocking.

How services fare in the survey by Passenger Focus

Just 29 per cent of passengers on the Greater Anglia mainline are satisfied it is value for money.  

On South West Trains’s Reading and Windsor service, the figure is just 33 per cent while London services stand at 35 per cent.

Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘There is no room for complacency.

'Far too many passengers remain frustrated at spiralling ticket prices, overcrowding and delays.

'The Government must end above inflation fares hikes.’

Thirty
five per cent of customers believe Southern's Gatwick Express is value 
for money while Southeastern’s mainline services rates just 36 per 
cent. 

Fewer than 48 per 
cent of passengers on First Great Western’s London Thames Valley 
services think they get value for their ticket price.

But it is even worse on First Capital Connect’s Thameslink North services at just 34 per cent.

North
of the border, only just 52 per cent of ScotRail passengers were 
satisfied with the value for money – dropping to just 40 per cent for urban 
services.

Satisfaction 
levels for value for money from individual operators also dropped for 
Grand Central, Heathrow Connect and ScotRail seeing the largest 
falls of six per cent - down to 73 per cent, 52 per cent and 52 per cent
respectively.

Overall 
satisfaction on individual routes ‘still varies widely’ for the worst 
performing Northern’s Manchester & Liverpool route (76 per cent) to 
the top rated Island Line on the Isle of Wight (97 per cent), operated 
by South West trains.

However,
the survey says passengers across Great Britain have reported ‘record 
levels’ of overall satisfaction with train services – 85 per cent 
overall with no operator scoring less than 80 per cent.

Lowest
ratings for overall satisfaction were given to Northern Rail (80 per 
cent), First Capital Connect (81 per cent), Southern (82 per cent), 
Greater Anglia, First Great Western and London Midland (all at 83 per 
cent).

Highest ratings for 
overall satisfaction were achieved by Grand Central (96 per cent), First
Hull Trains (95 per cent), and Heathrow Connect (94 per cent). 

Heathrow Express, c2c, and London Overground all scored 93 per cent satisfaction rating.

Nationally, some 83 per cent of passengers were satisfied with punctuality, up from 81 per cent in the autumn of last year.

But there were wide differences with the worst performers London Midland, Southern and Northern Rail and First Great Western.

Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said the findings were ‘further evidence of the success of today's railway’ saying: ‘Overall passenger satisfaction is at a record high and people are taking the train in growing numbers.’

But he added: ‘We recognise there is still much to be done.’

Rail Minister Norman Baker added: ‘It is very encouraging that satisfaction levels are at a record high of 85 per cent.

‘But there are areas where satisfaction is lower such as on fares, which is why we are determined to end the era of above-inflations increases as soon as we can.’
