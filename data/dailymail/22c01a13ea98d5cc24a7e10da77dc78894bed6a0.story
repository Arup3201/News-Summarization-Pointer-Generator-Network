Paul Nicholls has set his sights on cracking the £3million prizemoney barrier for the third time in his career after revealing he expects many of his big names to be in action at next month’s Grand National meeting at Aintree.

The man who has his ninth trainer’s title as good as in the bag also revealed he is likely to have more runners during the summer months in an attempt kick-start stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies’ title challenge in the post-AP McCoy era.

Definitely not heading to Aintree are Champion Chase winner Dodging Bullets and Coral Cup victor Aux Ptits Soins, who have run their last races of the season.

But Aintree-bound are Silviniaco Conti, a disappointing seventh beind Coneygree in the Gold Cup, as well as World Hurdle second and third Zarkandar and Saphir Du Rheu, with the latter possibly reverting back to steeplechasing.

Nicholls’ Grand National challenge is headed by Rocky Creek and Unioniste, whose Denman Chase third when trying to give weight to Gold Cup winner Coneygree at Newbury last month now looks a fair effort.

Nicholls, whose double at Kempton on Saturday following his three successes at the Cheltenham Festival took him to 97 winners and £2.63million for the campaign, said: ‘I love going to Aintree and the aim is to crack the £3m in prizemoney. There is a long way to go in the season yet. It would be nice to do that.

‘But there are a lot of horses I will finish now and save for next year. We want to help Sam be champion jockey . Anything a bit below top class could run on through the summer to try to get him as many winners before we properly get going.

‘Last year we had a very slow start and Sam only had five winners for us by October.’

Whether Silviniaco Conti runs in another Gold Cup has yet to be decided but after a third defeat in the race, Nicholls knows his priority with the gelding will be trying to win a third King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.

Nicholls, who revealed RSA Chase runner-up Southfield Theatre has underone an operation to prevent infection in the bad leg cut he picked up during the race, added: ’The plan with Silviniaco Conti will be Aintree if he is alright. He likes it there and I have to accept now he is better on a flat track.

‘Noel (Fehily) said he didn’t travel well throughout the Gold Cup although watching, it looked like he did. I think Coneygree got a lot of them out of their comfort zone. It is what Denman used to do to them.’

‘We will have to think about what to do but next season will be built around the Betfair Chase and King George without a shadow of a doubt.’

Meanwhile, although Mark Bradstock-trained Coneygree has run his last race of the season, younger brother Flintham could represent the family in the three-mile novices’ hurdle at the National meeting.
