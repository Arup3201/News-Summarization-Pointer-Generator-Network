A New York man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole Friday for raping a girl and killing her mother after cutting off his ankle monitor last year.

David Renz learned his fate in Onondaga County Court after a judge said he hoped the penalty would comfort the victims' family.

The 30-year-old had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, admitting that he carjacked Liverpool librarian Lori Ann Bresnahan and her 10-year-old daughter March 14, 2013.

Justice served: David Renz, 30, pictured entering Judge Thomas Miller's courtroom Friday, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for raping a girl and killing her mother

Divine judgement: Judge Thomas Miller warned Renz that one day he will face 'another judge' who will impose a much harsher sentence

Renz stabbed and strangled the mother as she tried to stop him from raping her daughter.

He had been under federal monitoring on child pornography charges but cut off his ankle GPS.

Renz was sentenced earlier this year to 30 years in federal prison for possessing more than 11,000 images and 1,100 videos of child pornography.

On Friday, Renz remained motionless and wore a blank expression on his face as his sentence was being read.

Innocent victim: Lori Ann Bresnahan, a school librarian from Liverpool, New York, was kidnapped along with her daughter by Renz last March and stabbed to death while trying to prevent her attacker from raping the 10-year-old

Judge Thomas Miller had some harsh words for the defendant, whose behavior last March he characterized as 'despicable,' Syracuse.com reported. 

‘One day, you will face another judge. One day when you pass from this earth, another judge will impose a harsher sentence for the absolute evil you committed,’ he said. 

Some of the slain librarian’s family members read their impact statements from the stand before the sentencing as Renz's relatives sat in the audience. 

‘Nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for such a tragedy in your own family,’ Bresnahan's cousin Jim O'Hara said.

O'Hara, a former reporter with The Post-Standard, vividly described in his six-page handwritten statement the moment he found out that his relative had been brutally murdered, saying that he felt as cold 'as the most brutal of winter days.' 

Kathleen Renz, the convicted killer’s mother, spoke to reporters after her son's sentencing, saying that she prays every day for Lori Bresnahan and her daughter.

Mrs Renz added that she was relieved to learn that federal prosecutors will not seek capital punishment for her son.

'It's a great burden lifted,' the mother said.

The victim’s family pleaded with officials not to hold a death penalty trial to spare Bresnahan’s daughter additional trauma.

Spared: Renz, pictured here in 2013, will not face the death penalty because the victim's family said they do not want Bresnahan's daughter to testify against him in court

The shocking murder of Lori Breshnahan - and 
the rape of her young daughter - occurred while Renz was awaiting trial 
for the child pornography charges, and was confined to his home and 
required to wear a monitoring device.

On March 14, 2013 - just six weeks 
after he'd been arrested for possessing child pornography - Renz removed
 his required electronic monitoring device and drove to the Great 
Northern Mann in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse.

Once at the mall, Renz parked his car
 and walked around the parking lot, where he found Breshnahan - a school
 librarian - and her daughter getting into their vehicle.

Renz then forced his way into Breshahan's car using an air pistol he claimed was a real gun and forced her to drive to a remote area of the mall's parking lot where he bound both of his victims and - using a knife to cut a hole in her clothes - raped the young girl.

Prosecutors said Renz was trying to 
use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she 
fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle.

As the girl ran off and was rescued 
by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed 
in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police 
shortly after.

Weeks after the attack, a report by a
 federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on 
Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal 
probation officers in Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or 
demoted.

Renz pleaded guilty to the murder and rape charges last year.

Authorities say that several of the 
child pornography videos found in Renz's possession depicted acts 
similar to the rape and murder for which Renz pleaded guilty.

'Let
 the defendant's other victims not 
be forgotten,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Fletcher said during Renz's 
child pornography sentencing hearing in March, according to Syracuse.com.

'Each and every child in each and every one of 
the defendant's 11,000 images and 1,100 videos for which he stands 
convicted, every single one of those children was used by David Renz to 
fuel his twisted interest in the exploitation of children. Every one of 
them is also his victim.'

Fletcher
 asked for a sentence of 30 to 70 years, and asked that any sentence the
 judge imposed would run consecutively with whatever sentence Renz gets 
for Breshahan's murder.

Renz's attorney, Assistant Federal 
Public Defender Randi Bianco, asked for a sentence within the sentencing
 guidelines of 19 to 24 years, citing the difficult life Renz has 
suffered as the result of a facial deformity.

Renz was born without the lower half of his left jaw and part of his cheekbone - a hereditary condition that would come to dominate his and his family's lives.

The man's father, brother and sister all had the facial deformity but it was more pronoucnded in him, requiring multiple jaw-lengthening surgeries that drained his parents' already limited resources. 

In school, his friends recalled that Renz had to cover the hole in his neck from a tracheotomy so he could be heard, drawing bewildered stares from his classmates.

Those who knew him as a child described Renz as a bright kid who loved computers and was good at math, science and social studies, but he was also a loner who was always picked last for athletic  activities and group work.
