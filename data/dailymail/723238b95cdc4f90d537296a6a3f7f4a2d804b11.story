The Newsnight fiasco claimed another scalp yesterday as Iain Overton resigned as editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

Mr Overton offered his resignation following the disastrous investigation into child abuse claims by the BIJ and Newsnight.

Friends said he had fallen on his sword because of the explosive Twitter message he sent about the programme, and not because of any involvement in the investigation, which was led by BIJ reporter Angus Stickler.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen called for backers of the BIJ to end their support for the not-for-profit organisation, which claims to have received up to £20,000 from charities.

He tabled an Early Day Motion calling on MPs to support his claim that the BIJ was ‘totally discredited as a serious producer of quality journalism’. The BIJ worked with Newsnight on a reinvestigation of child abuse claims from the 1970s at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales.

Mr Overton tweeted on the morning of November 2: ‘If all goes well we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.’ The message prompted a storm of speculation about the man’s identity, despite Newsnight’s decision not to give a name in its broadcast that night.

There have been reports that BBC2’s flagship news programme was ‘bounced’ into running the item because of the tweet, without putting the unfounded allegation to Lord McAlpine.

The trustees of the BIJ, who include Sir David Bell, an adviser to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into Press standards, said they were ‘appalled’ by the apparent breach of the bureau’s own standards of journalism. They accepted Mr Overton’s resignation as editor, which came with a salary and pension package of £75,000 plus an annual bonus of up to £6,000.

The BIJ was founded in 2009 with a £2million pledge from the Potter Foundation, a charity run by computer tycoon David Potter and his wife Elaine, a former Sunday Times journalist.

Mr Potter, who founded Psion, donated £90,000 to the Labour Party in 2001 and was appointed a non-executive governor of the Bank of England two years later.

On its website, the BIJ claimed it had also received ‘charitable funding’ from organisations including Oxfam, Save the Children, Stamp Out Poverty and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust.

Oxfam said it had given a one-off sum of £1,500 to support an investigation into lobbying practices in the financial sector as part of its Robin Hood Tax campaign.

A spokesman said: ‘We believe it is legitimate to employ independent journalists in support of Oxfam’s campaigning agenda. We will continue to evaluate their use on a case-by-case basis.’

Save the Children denied it had ever made any charitable donations to the BIJ but said it had commissioned research from it.

A spokesman said: ‘We did employ them recently to carry out some research into corporate responsibility and its impact on children. We have no plans to work with the BIJ again.’

The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust said it donated a grant of £4,000 in June this year to ‘assist the Advisory Group on Charitable Status and Journalism to research, articulate and disseminate arguments in favour of charitable public interest journalism’, and said it had no plans for further donations. Stamp Out Poverty said it gave £2,500 in December to assist research into the financial services industry, and said it was a one-off payment for a specific project.

On its website the BIJ claimed it had received charitable funding from a number of organisations including Oxfam

In a submission to the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Overton said he wanted the BIJ to be a ‘masterclass’ in public interest journalism and that its work was so important it should receive a levy from the Press.

Sources close to Mr Overton, a former senior producer at the BBC and commissioning editor at ITN, said he was ‘mortified’ by his tweet and regretted any damage he had caused to the BIJ’s reputation.

They said he had been diagnosed with a serious illness that led to him consuming ‘potent medication’ and ‘taking his eye off the ball’ as the child abuse investigation unfolded.

BIJ chairman of trustees James Lee, a film industry entrepreneur, said: ‘His resignation is a real tragedy. He has always shown tireless commitment to the Bureau and we thank him for all his hard work.’

The other trustees are the Potters, Sir David Bell, a former chairman of the Financial Times, and Professor George Brock, head of journalism at City University, which provides subsidised offices to the BIJ.

Its team of journalists has produced investigations for broadcasters and newspapers, including a previous Newsnight probe which claimed the charity Help For Heroes used some of its money to subsidise Ministry of Defence building projects rather than fund help for injured service personnel. The charity said the report was misleading.

A spokesman for the BIJ said: ‘The Bureau has won awards by disclosing important information in the public interest and, with only this recent exception, by maintaining high standards of journalism. The Bureau remains absolutely committed to this aim.’
