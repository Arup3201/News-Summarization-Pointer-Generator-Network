Doctors treating Formula One racing legend Michael Schumacher are continuing efforts to bring him out of his artificial coma despite reports to the contrary.

Germany’s news magazine Focus stated that doctors had abandoned their attempts following 'complications'.

But, responding to the article, Schumacher’s manager said that despite the process taking a long time, it was 'unchanged'.

'Misinterpretation': A report in the German media that doctors had abandoned attempts to bring Michael Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) out of a coma has been denied by his manager

Denial: Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the waking-up process remained 'unchanged'

Sabine Kehm said: 'This phase can take a long time, which, much to our regret, can lead to many misinterpretations.'

It
 was eight weeks ago yesterday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his 
life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort
 of Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

The seven-time world champion is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital.

Wife Corinna, 44, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside.

Last week French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.

The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area.

Schumacher lost control when he hit a rock and ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down the mountain.

His family issued a statement earlier this month saying that they 'strongly believe' he will recover.

The
 family said the most important element of his recovery was not the 
speed but that it progressed in a 'continuous and controlled way'.

The update came in the wake of reports that Schumacher had contracted pneumonia.

The
 statement said: 'Michael's family would like to again express their 
sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the 
world.

'The good wishes they receive help the family and we are convinced
 they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process.

'As
 often in such situation, no day is like the next.

'The family is 
thankful for ones understanding that they would not wish to disclose 
medical details in order to protect Michael’s privacy.

February 22 - On visit to hospital, racing driver and friend Felipe Massa says: 'I saw his mouth move.'

'As
 assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive
 new information on Michael’s health state.

'We are aware that the wake 
up phase can take a long time.

'The
 family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place 
all their trust in the doctors, nurses and nursing auxiliaries team.

'The
 important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael’s 
healing process progresses in a continuous and controlled way.'

Last week, ex-colleague Felipe Massa visited Schumacher in hospital and spoken to him.

'He sleeps looks but quite normal,' he said. 'I think he even reacted a bit.'

Schumacher
 receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a 
machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently.

Three 
times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and 
bed sores.

The coma 
suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory 
drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this 
wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all.

His
 blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned 
and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing.

He
 lies on a special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his
 urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of 
waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially 
fatal infection.
