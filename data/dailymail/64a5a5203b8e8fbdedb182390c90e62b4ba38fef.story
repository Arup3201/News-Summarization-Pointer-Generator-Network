Superhero beat-em-ups are very thin on the ground. Although Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was a commendable effort, it oozed 'identity crisis'. The former's trademark gore was sacrificed while the idea of DC characters doing 'finishing moves' didn't quite work.

Thankfully, NetherRealm Studios addressed this, releasing the brilliant and brutal Mortal Kombat in 2011.

Claws are out: Catwoman is one of the playable characters, and she can use her whip to damage opponents

Now the same team have developed Injustice: Gods Among Us... and it's looking like the game superhero fans have been waiting for.

A large part of this is down to the clever narrative design. Similar to Mortal Kombat, NetherRealmÂ  want to make the entire experience feel like an interactive movie. Gone are random fragmented bouts, replaced by battles cleverly connected by game-engine-rendered (and often interactive) cut-scenes.

Thankfully, fighting is superb. There are lots of famous characters available, ranging from Batman and Bane, to Superman and Deathstroke.

Each one has their own abilites and fighting style. Batman, for example, is a master of martial arts and this is reflected in his wide-range of kicks, punches and grapples. He can also use gadgets such as the Batclaw and explosive Batarangs.

Superman, in contrast, can fire lasers from his eyes and use his immense strength to throw foes around like ragdolls.

Each character has a selection of special moves. When you build up enough points, pressing both triggers sees them launch into a brutal combination. Batman can call in the Batmobile to run his foe down, while The Flash sprints around the planet before landing a devastating uppercut on his opponent's chin.

Brutal: Characters all look and move realistically, while environments offer different sections to explore

If both of you do a similar move at the same time, you enter a Wager mode, a quick-time event where you gamble points on whether you can press the button before your foe does.

The environment can take damage, too, and clever level design means each one has multiple tiers. When at certain parts of a level, a move can be unleashed which launches your opponent into a new section of the arena. It's a brilliant mechanic, and each level has a different cut-scene, giving you lots of incentive to explore.

Graphically, the game is strong. Although the Unreal 3 Engine looks somewhat strained rendering larger expanses and NPCs in the cinematics, main character models look brilliantly detailed - clearly displaying tears and cuts after gruelling exchanges.

It's scheduled for release on April 19.
