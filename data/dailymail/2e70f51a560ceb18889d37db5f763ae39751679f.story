A worrying trend is affecting millions of little American girls who are so concerned about being overweight that they're resorting to dieting before the age of seven, according to a study.

The research was carried out by Common Sense Media - a nonprofit organization that reviews media content targeted at kids.

It showed that one out of four children had dieted prior to turning seven-years-old. 

And a staggering 80 per cent of American girls aged 10 had been on a diet over fears about their looks.

Worry: A staggering 80 per cent of American girls aged 10 have been on a diet over fears about their looks and one-third of boys wish their bodies were much thinner

But the diet-fad was not just confined to girls - one-third of boys and the majority of girls ages six to eight-years-old also want their bodies to be thinner.

Researchers found that boys' own body concerns and risky behavior can go unnoticed because dieting was not traditionally seen as one of their concerns. 

The organization is encouraging parents  to listen to children if they engage in negative talk about their bodies, or, signs of dramatic weight loss or weight gain.

Along with these vital warning signs, parents can check what they're kids coaches, peers and social media peers are saying.  

The study placed blame on the media's unrealistic depictions of body images - particularly among pop stars, models and entertainers.

Some pop stars, like Lorde, have chosen to address the issue head on after she recently realized that a photograph of her had been photoshopped to rid her face of imperfections.

She tweeted to fans: 'I find this curious - two photos from today, one edited so my skin is perfect and one real.' Remember flaws are OK :)

Media: Children are increasingly being affected by the media's often unrealistic depictions of body images - their family's attitudes, their peers, where they live and even their teachers

Social media: Girls tend to post more photos online, but it can be stressful, with 57 per cent of girls verses 28 per cent of boys feeling left out when they see pictures of others together posted online

Boys: Boys' own body concerns and risky behavior can go unnoticed and their role in supporting healthy attitudes among girls is vital

According to Common Sense Media, when kindergarten-age children are asked to indicate their ideal body size, nearly a third of them choose a size that's smaller than their own. 

Then, by the age of six, most kids are aware of what 'dieting' means and many admit that they have tried it.

With the rise of social media sites, like Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, children are also increasingly being affected by other people's ideas about how they look in photos posted online. 

Girls tend to post more photos online, but it can be stressful with 28 per cent of girls admitting to editing images of themselves online. 

At least 57 per cent of girls verses 28 per cent of boys said they felt left out when they see pictures of others together posted online. And more teenage girls than teen boys text every day.

Twitter has more members that are girls than boys and sites, like tumblr, encourage young girls to seek to be perfect  egged on by posts that aim for 'Fitspiration,' and 'how to be skinny.'

One site called 'Get Thinspo' showcases skinny girls and has the motto: 'You spend the first 10 years of your life playing with barbies and the next 10 trying to be one.' 

However, there are other factors, including parents and peers attitude to weight which can also shape small children's attitudes towards themselves.

The Common Sense Media researchers revealed: 'They take their cues from peers, adults, and media around them. 

'Young children in particular pick up models for how to think and behave from those around them. Body-related talk and behavior is no exception.'

The U.S. dieting industry is currently worth just over $60 billion annually and eating disorders affect at least 30 million Americans.

Claire Mysko, a representative from the National Eating Disorders Association told The Huffington Post that society's obsession with weight loss has made the data unsurprising.

She said: 'We live in a culture where the emphasis on weight loss and thinness is everywhere, so it's not surprising that young people are getting caught up in these obsessions.'

And when children are dissatisfied with their bodies, they're more likely to struggle with low self-esteem, depression, and eating disorders.
