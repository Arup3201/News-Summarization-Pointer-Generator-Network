Liverpool defender Kolo Toure is hoping he will be offered a deal to stay at the Anfield club with his current contract running out at the end of the season.

The 33-year-old, who arrived on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2013, has held no talks with the club yet regarding a new deal as he prepares to head out to the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast.

The centre back, who has only made 13 appearances for the club this season, could potentially miss eight games for Liverpool and acknowledges his absence could hinder his chances of landing a new contract at Anfield.

'I know that while I'm in Africa other players will play [for Liverpool] and I won't be able to help the team. All I can do is go there, do my best, then come back and fight to show that I'm still a top player,' Toure told the Liverpool Echo.

'If I get the chance to stay for another year, I will be happy - but it's not up to me. If I was going to stay, I would maybe have expected to hear something by now

'I don't think too much about the future. I will enjoy every single minute at this club and keep giving 100 per cent,' added Toure.

Toure is expected to play a part in Liverpool's visit to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on Monday evening before heading off to Equatorial Guinea for the tournament, which runs for three weeks from January 17 until February 8.

After the tournament Toure plans to retire from international football to concentrate on prolonging the rest of his club career but insists missing the Africa Cup of Nations was never an option.

'My career has been great. I've played for three fantastic clubs. If I can continue playing for this amazing club, I would love that - but if I need to go somewhere else to keep playing then I will,' said Toure.

'This kind of situation when you leave your club during the season is always difficult,' he said. 'What do you do as a player? It's tough. You don't like to miss matches for your club. But when the time comes, for us as Africans, we want to make our continent and our country proud. 

'At the end of the day, I'm African, I'm from the Ivory Coast. If I get a call from my country I have to go. I am finished after this. I hope I will finish on a high.'
