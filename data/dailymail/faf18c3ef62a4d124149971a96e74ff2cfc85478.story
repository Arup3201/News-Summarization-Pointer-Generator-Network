Defendant: Siale Angilau, pictured, who reportedly belonged to Tongan Crip gang, was hospitalized with at least one chest wound, FBI spokesman Mark Dressen said. He later died in hospital of his injuries

A U.S. marshal shot and killed a defendant on Monday in a new federal courthouse after the man rushed the witness stand with a pen at his trial in Salt Lake City, authorities said.

Defendant Siale Angilau, who reportedly belonged to Tongan Crip gang, was hospitalized with at least one chest wound, FBI spokesman Mark Dressen said. He later died in hospital of his injuries.

'During the trial this morning the defendant went after, engaged the witness stand, and when he engaged the witness at the witness stand, he was shot by the U.S. Marshals Service,' Dressen said.

'From what I understand, the defendant may have grabbed a pen or a pencil and charged the witness stand at that time.'

The witness wasn't hurt.

Angilau, 
25, was one of 17 people named in a 29-count racketeering indictment 
filed in 2008 accusing gang members of conspiracy, assault, robbery and 
weapons offenses.

Along
 with a string of robberies and assaults of local store clerks, the 
6-foot-3, 260-pound Angilau also was accused of assaulting two federal 
officers and brandishing a firearm.

Angilau was the last defendant in the case to stand trial, U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Melodie Rydalch said.

A
 person inside the court told the Salt Lake Tribune that the marshal 
fired eight shots at the defendant after he jumped up from the defense 
table and charged the witness stand, trying to punch the witness.

The witness was reportedly a prison inmate who was testifying about the gang and its inner workings.

Scary: Federal Courthouse employees evacuate as police investigate a shooting inside the Federal Courthouse. The shooting has left at least one person injured, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney said

Angilau's attorneys, Michael Langford and Mark Kittrell, did not immediately respond to messages.

The new $185 million federal courthouse 
opened a week ago in downtown Salt Lake City next door to the 
century-old federal courthouse.

The case was being heard in U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell's courtroom.

Before Angilau died, the incident prompted Campbell to declare a mistrial.

'The court has met with the jury and and observed that most of the jury members are visibly shaken and upset by this episode,' the judge wrote, according to USA Today.

'The court finds that this occurrence in the courtroom would so prejudice Mr. Angilau as to deprive him of a fair trial.'
