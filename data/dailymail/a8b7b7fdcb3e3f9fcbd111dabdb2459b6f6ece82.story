A young father and veteran who lost all four of his limbs during his third tour in the Middle East is sharing his brave story of survival. 

Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, of Hallowell, Maine, was critically injured on April 10, 2012, when an improvised explosive device went off after he set down his ammunition bag, causing him to lose portions of both arms and legs.

His injuries were so bad, he even sent away the medic attending to him away thinking he would die, saying, 'Get away from me, doc. You go save my men. Let me go. Save my men.' 

Now, Sgt. Mills, a quadruple amputee, has dedicated his life to inspiring others and helping other wounded and injured veterans.

Tragedy: Sgt Mills (above) is one of only five soldiers to return from the Middle East a quadruple amputee, and now spends his time inspiring others by sharing his story of survival

In an interview with NBC Dallas, Sgt. Mills says he is just happy to be alive, and still can't believe he is still here to share his story.

'When I look back at it, I understand that I probably…I probably wasn't supposed to make it that day,' he said. 

In the interview he also made a point to say that though he is one of only five military members to return from battle in Afghanistan and Iraq as a quadruple amputee, he is no different from the thousands of other wounded vets.

Movie star: Sgt. Mills will also be sharing his story in the new documentaryTravis: A Solider's Story

'It's my story, but there are so many other guys out there like me,' he explained. 

That is why Sgt. Mills, 27, founded the Travis Mills Foundation, a nonprofit organization, formed to benefit and assist wounded and injured veterans.

He also started Travis Mills Group, LLC where he consults with and speaks to companies and organizations nationwide, using his story to inspire others.

And, as if that was not enough, he will also appear in a new documentary produced by Fotolanthropy about his life, Travis: A Solider's Story.

The documentary features interviews with Travis and his wife Kelsey, detailing his horrific injury and the daily struggles and challenges he faces as a result of his life-altering injury.

It also features his young daughter Chloe, who was born just months before Sgt. Mills left for Afghanistan. 

Shocking admission: In a recent interview, Sgt. Mills reveals that he probably was not supposed to make it out alive after the IED explosion

After his injury, Sgt. Mills dedicated himself to getting out of the hospital in 10 months so he could be reunited with his family - especially his young daughter.

He admits in a preview for his documentary however, that he was still very much afraid of the future, saying, 'I was really worried about what life was going to be life afterward.'

He also revealed that he immediately thought of his child after the explosion, thinking to himself, 'My baby girl, am I ever gonna see her again?'

Humor: Sgt. Mills has kept his sense of humor through this all, recently convincing an interviewer (above) that she could get his hand to turn by gruffly saying 'turn tight' to his prosthetic arm

Through all these difficulties and challenges though, Sgt. Mills still somehow manages to keep a sense of humor about everything, lightening even the tensest of moments.

While speaking with NBC, he informed the woman interviewing him that he could make his prosthetic hand move on command by saying 'turn right.'

He then urged her to try, telling her to make her voice more 'gruff' and lower each time to get it to work, though the hand never turned.

Eventually the young woman realized, it was all a joke, and Sgt. Mills thanked her 'for playing.'
