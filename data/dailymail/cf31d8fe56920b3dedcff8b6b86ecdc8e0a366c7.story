We’ve all been there - that moment when you receive a kind gift from a loved one that turns out to be quite far from what you were hoping for.

But instead of smiling politely and thanking Aunt Sally for her generosity, some ungrateful recipients launched a barrage of complaints on Twitter.

Most of the complaints were from entitled individuals saying they were upset after not receiving an Apple iPhone, iPad or car on Christmas Day.

Entitled: Instead of smiling politely and thanking auntie for her generosity, some ungrateful recipients launched a barrage of complaints on Twitter

Sad: Jon Hendren, of comedy website Something Awful, retweeted dozens of the best ungrateful tweets he saw on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day

Compilation: Within 48 hours of the tweets being posted, online musician Jonathan Mann had turned a mixture of the tweets into a song

'Am I the only one in the world who didn't get an iPhone for Christmas?,' Twitter user Liljumperayla, of New York, wrote on Christmas Day.

'My mom only got me diamond earrings, odd future jacket, 30$,' Bernard Barefield, of Collinsville, Illinois, wrote.

'My mom got a tablet, brother got a laptop. She lied to me...'

Jon Hendren, of comedy website Something Awful, retweeted dozens of the best ungrateful tweets he saw on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

Sought after: Many people were hoping for an iPhone, left, or iPad, right, this year

Angry: Most of the complaints were from entitled individuals saying they were upset after not receiving an Apple iPhone, iPad or car on Christmas Day

Not pleased: This Twitter user was so unhappy about not receiving a car that it appeared to have ruined her whole Christmas

Where is it? Nicole Rose was expecting a 'car with a big red bow in the driveway'

‘I was visiting with my family,’ Mr Hendren told Tech Crunch. ‘They’d all gone to bed somewhat early on Christmas Eve night.

'Well my Christmas is pretty much ruined, I’m not getting my car till after tomorrow. So much for a car with a big red bow in the driveway'

‘I was lying awake playing with Twitter’s search function on my iPhone… I think I did about 40 or 50 before people started posting fake tweets.

‘There are probably even better real ones among all the fake ones out there by now, but it’s too hard to tell.’

Within 48 hours of Mr Hendren's retweets, online musician Jonathan Mann had turned a mixture of the tweets into a song, reported Tech Crunch.

‘Well my Christmas is pretty much ruined - I’m not getting my car until after tomorrow,’ Nicole Rose wrote. ’So much for a car with a big red bow in the driveway.’
