Lugging kit around and dealing with upset neighbours is part of many drummer's lives.

Now a team of British inventors claims to have created a solution to these problems by designing an 'invisible' drum kit.

Dubbed AeroDrums, the gadget uses real-time motion-tracking technology to make the musician sound as if they are playing the real thing.

'I had to stop drumming when I went to college because of noise and lack of space,' said Richard Lee, co-inventor of the system.

'Now I can carry Aerodrums in my shoulder bag and my neighbours can't hear me drum when I wear headphones.'

To make it easy for the system to follow movements, users place reflective strips on their feet and hold drumsticks with reflective panels on the ends.

A Sony PlayStation 3 eye camera then locks onto these strips to track movements, converting them into sounds produced by a drum synthesiser.

Based on the position of the reflective patches, the system knows if the user is 'hitting' a hi-hat, snare or cymbal, and with what intensity.

'We've talked to many teachers, and some told us a couple of things that bode well for practicing with Aerodrums,' one of the creators Yann Morvan told Drum Magazine.

'They tell students to steer clear from high rebound surfaces when practicing, for fear of relying too much on rebound; and a few encourage those who don't have a kit to air-drum between lessons'.

The Edgware-based team, however, admitted that the 'invisible' kit doesn't work well in sunlight and difficult lighting conditions.

It can be configured to include up to five toms and two bass drums.

Drummers can also see their virtual drum kit set up on a laptop in front of them, to help guide their movements.

The kit includes the sticks, stick tips, reflective strips, the camera and software. The full set is currently available on Amazon for $160 or £100.
