Memorabilia: One of the three letters from Lady Grace Drummond-Hay to her mother

It has a scorched label and the 
top foil has been burnt off during the Hindenburg crash but it remains 
sealed and full of beer.

Also being sold is letters from the first woman ever to fly around the world in an airship, Lady Grace Drummond-Hay.

Of the 97 people on board the German passenger airship there were 35 fatalities, including one death among the ground crew at the site of the crash in New Jersey, USA.

The 1937 disaster - during which the airship caught fire - shattered public confidence in the airship and marked the end of the airship era.

The bottle of beer was saved by a fireman called Leroy Smith who discovered six unopened bottles at the scene which he secretly buried and returned later to retrieve.

He gave five to friends and kept one bottle of beer for himself.

Mr Kirch’s enormous collection of artefacts is being sold at Wallis and Wallis auctioneers in Lewes over four auctions.

The first auction held in March this year made £220,000 the second in July sold for approximately £80,000 and the third lot to be sold on November 28 is expected to make £160,000.

Head auctioneer Glenn Butler said: ‘We have 596 lots to sell this time around.

‘There are a few star items that could sell for big money.

‘The bottle of beer has a fantastic story and I think a lot of collectors will be interested in the Lady Drummond-Hay memorabilia.

‘The previous sale had lots of postcards and smaller money items but I think this one will attract big bidders.

‘It is a fascinating collection and we have been lucky to have it here.

‘We have all learned a lot more about airships by working through and cataloguing the collection.’

The auction in November will feature 22 lots relating to Lady Drummond-Hay, a British journalist who became the first woman to travel round the world by airship.

These include an original A4 soft covered book written by herself and Karl H. Von Wiegaud called The First Oceanic Voyage Of An Airliner, as well as her ticket for a 1930 pan-America flight.

There are also letters from Lady Drummond-Hay to her mother in London Mrs Lethbridge and letters from Capt Christiansen and Hugo Eckener to Lady Drummond-Hay.

Each lot is expected to reach between £100 and £200.

Mr Kirch, from Jersey, is believed to own the world’s biggest personal collection of airship memorabilia which he has collected over 35 years.

Property tycoon Mr Kirch has only given one interview about his collection and has declined to give any more information.

In the front of the auction catalogue he has written: ‘For the past 35 years I have been an avid collection of all things Airship.

‘In the early days I would do the searching on my own, but gradually I built up a small network of people who would look out for Zeppelin and Airship items for me.

‘The advent of eBay brought even more items to my attention and it meant that I built up a vast collection which in all honesty became too large to be held at my property in Jersey.

‘I own Shed No. 2 at Cardington and had grand ideas of opening a museum there with Airship flights over London, but unfortunately I have come to realise that these sort of enterprises are no longer viable at my time of life.’

He has said previously all the money from the sale will be donated to charity.

Other highlights from the collection include a rare Hindenburg passenger list which was handed out to all 56 passengers on board including boxer Max Schmeling who was returning to Germany after beating Joe Louis.

The most expensive lot is a silver-gilt commemorative model of an airship hallmarked Goldsmith’s and Silversmith’s Co, London 1910.

It is a realistically detailed 64cm model and is expected to reach between £15,000 and £20,000.

More unusual artefacts include a clockwork airship toy with yellow wind up propeller expected to sell for £1500 and a section of 90cm twisted metal from the Graf Zeppelin, worth £1500.

A Zeppelin menu featuring ‘Champignon risotto’ dated 1936 and featuring a swastika on the front will also be sold for £120.

The Zeppelin was created by a German, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin born in 1838. He has seen tethered balloons being used as an observation post during the American Civil War.
