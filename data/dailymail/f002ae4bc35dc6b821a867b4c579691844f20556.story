There was a match during Atletico Madrid’s La Liga-winning campaign last season against Real Madrid when Diego Costa twice spat in his gloved hand then threw the phlegm at Sergio Ramos.

The defender was, understandably, incensed by the revolting act, but it was done so discreetly the referee was unable to punish the striker.

During the game he lightly rocks his head — just short of a head-butt — into Ramos, slaps him, and verbally winds up Pepe several times. At the end of the game, they hug and make up.

Costa is football’s ultimate Machiavellian character, one who would give Shakespeare’s Iago a run for his money when it comes to the subtle dark arts of manipulation.

‘Diego has been playing like this since he started playing football,’ explains Filipe Luis, who spent four years as his team-mate at Atletico Madrid before the pair moved over to Stamford Bridge within a day of each other last summer. ‘He never changes.’

Tottenham’s defenders beware; they are in for a bumpy ride when they face Chelsea at Wembley this afternoon.

A month into the season Costa escaped a ban despite putting his hands around Pablo Zabaleta’s neck. Both players were booked but the Manchester City defender was sent off for a second yellow card.

The striker was not, however, so fortunate in the second leg of Chelsea’s League Cup semi-final win against Liverpool, when he was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Emre Can. He also caught Martin Skrtel with his studs.

But Luis has a different interpretation than most of Costa’s actions. ‘He is not violent or aggressive, he is intense,’ he says.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been incensed with the treatment of Costa this season

‘He tries to win all the balls in any way possible. That’s the kind of players we need and we have that in the team. I don’t think reputation means anything.’

Alongside Costa’s goals — he scored a phenomenal 35 in 46 games last season — this mentality is what persuaded Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to lighten his wallet by £32million in July.

But bans are costly. Missing three matches has left Costa stilted and without a goal in the two games he has played since his return. Luis, however, is convinced his team-mate is now back to match fitness, making him ready to inflict his might on Tottenham.

Costa has been playing like this, as Luis says, since he gained his footballing education on the streets of Lagarto in one of Brazil’s most impoverished regions. A boy playing among men, he learned to use his physicality to score goals.

The experience grew his fiercely competitive and combative nature. ‘He always wants to win, in training, in video games, in cards, everywhere he plays he wants to win,’ Luis adds. ‘Everybody here at Chelsea has this ambition. To get to a big club like Chelsea you have to have this ambition inside you, so Diego is not an exception.

‘Every minute he plays he gives everything. Everybody knows him, he always tries to win, he tries to help the team. He plays for the team, he doesn’t play for himself. That’s the kind of player that helps Chelsea to be champions.

‘Of course he is going to be in the best way for the game because he is a striker, he is joint top-scorer in the league right now (on 17 with Sergio Aguero), he wants cups, he is ambitious, so that’s why I am so proud to play with him.’

Jose Mourinho seeks winners to bring home trophies. Today could bring the first of many in his second spell in charge. Costa is prepared to win it. At all costs.
