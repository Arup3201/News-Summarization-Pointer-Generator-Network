Dallas Police said that they believe they both perished around 3pm on the kitchen of McClain's home - which Todhunter apparently had a key to.

Authorities revealed that the couple had split two weeks before and that they had been called out twice to McClain's rented home twice before for domestic disturbances.

Friends said she was having a hard time coping with the split. Todhunter had also recently started carrying a handgun, which police believe is the murder weapon

When McClain’s family learned of the murder-suicide, his father, Russell McClain said he knew his son didn't shoot anyone.

'I knew it wasn't him,' said Russell. 'It wasn't his character; he would walk away…that was the only thing I could think, was that she surprised him. She had to have surprised him.'

According to Dallasnews, McClain was a chief petty officer with the US Navy and was listed as on active duty.

He enlisted in January 2001 and was working for the Navy Recruiting District, Dallas - for special ops.

Todhunter was studying at Eastfield College in Mesquite and police said that the couple had no children together, but did have their own from previous relationships.

McClain's mother raised the alarm when he son missed his son's baseball game on Saturday.

When she went to his house and he didn't answer she went around the back and saw the body of Todhunter on the kitchen floor.

Neighbors expressed their shock and said that the area does not usually suffer murder-suicides.

'The gentleman that lives there was supposed to attend a ball game of his son yesterday,' said Lt. David Nabors with the Rowlett Police Department.

'He didn’t show up for the ball game. His mother tried to get in contact with him and she wasn’t able to get him by the phone. She came over here to the house today to try to get a hold of him and he didn’t answer the door.

'She walked around the back of the house and saw the deceased female through the rear door.'
