Sean Reah, of South Shields, South Tyneside, has been arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred in connection with this image

Grinning brazenly as he lifts up his shirt to reveal an inflammatory image of a mosque being blown up, this man was pictured openly with his offending tattoo at a far-right rally.

The man, who is believed to be a supporter of the English Defence League, is understood to have been pictured at the group's rally, in Birmingham, at the weekend.

The man lifted his football shirt to reveal the image of the Muslim place of worship with the word 'Boom!' written across it.

The image has sparked outrage after it was posted online.

It was taken at a demonstration in Birmingham, according to The Sun, where police made 20 arrests after officers came under attack on Saturday.

A 20-year-old woman has been charged with violent disorder and was due to appear in court earlier this week.

Two men were also charged with offences connected to the EDL rally and a counter-protest in Birmingham city centre.

Officers made a total of 20 arrests, mainly for public order breaches, after being pelted with cans, bottles, stones and other missiles during sporadic disorder.

Two men aged 26 and 22 have been bailed to appear before Walsall Magistrates' Court on August 9 charged with possessing offensive weapons.

A police spokesman said: 'Police enquiries are ongoing to see whether any other offences were committed during the demonstrations.

'The wealth of exceptional quality CCTV within the area is likely to provide significant investigative opportunities to bring a large number of offenders to justice for what, at times, appeared to be serious offences.

'There were a total of three hospital
 admissions for minor injuries, one of which was a police officer who 
received head injuries after being hit by bricks. 

'He was treated at hospital and later discharged.'
