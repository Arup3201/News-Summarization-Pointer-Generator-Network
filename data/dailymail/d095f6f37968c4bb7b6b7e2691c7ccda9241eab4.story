A 10-year-old boy is in hospital after being hit by an unmarked police car as he crossed the road. 

The child, whose condition is not thought to be serious, was walking across Plumstead High Street, south east London, when he was struck by the vehicle. 

Metropolitan Police confirmed the car was on its way to reports of a home intrusion at the time of the accident. 

A London Air Ambulance helicopter landed in Plumstead, south east London, after a 10-year-old boy was hit by an unmarked police car as he crossed the road 

The boy was airlifted to a south London hospital where his condition is 'not serious', police said. 

The Serious Collision Investigation Unit has launched an investigation into the incident. 

On-lookers described seeing the boy 'under the car' as he crossed Plumstead High Street at around 3pm this afternoon with two other youngsters, thought to be his brothers. 

The road was closed for a period but has since been reopened. 

'(The) little boy was under car for few minutes while police assessed safety to reverse back. They took good care of him,' one witness told MailOnline.

Plumstead High Street near the junction with Rippolson Road was closed for around two hours today
