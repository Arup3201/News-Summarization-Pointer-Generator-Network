One unlucky bride literally fell head over heels on her wedding day.

Julia Magdaleno was getting ready to make her big entrance at her wedding reception at Jackpot Ranch in Camp Verde, Arizona, on October 11, when her new groom, Chad Kannard, decided to be spontaneous and pick her up in his arms as they sprinted into the tent holding all their guests.

Things were going great for the first few seconds of their entrance, but then Chad, 27, dropped Julia to the ground, falling on top of her and causing brief panic among the guests.

Party foul: Things then start to go awry when Chad runs a little too fast and starts to fall

Game over: Then, it all gets ruined when Chad drops his bride and falls on top of her

Happy couple: Despite what happened, Julia (seen with Chad earlier that day) says she really was not hurt or injured

Lucky for both, they were just a little scrapped and bloodied, and clearly fueled by that newlywed bliss, they both popped right back up, with Julia, 25, getting in Chad's arms once again as they continued their entrance.

Ain't love grand. 

In an interview with ABC News, Julia explained that the fall, which happened on a concrete walkway, looks far, far worse than it actually was.

'Both his arms went under me so really he took most of the impact. It looks like in the video he body slammed me but really, I really felt, like, nothing,' she said. 

'I was kind of sore the next day but, I mean, when you fall onto the cement, of course you’re going to be sore.'

Bouncing back: Seconds after the fall the couple was back on their feet

Seeing the bright side: Julia is now happy she and her new husband had a unique wedding entrance

Now, the high school sweethearts from Phoenix just can't believe how popular they have become - and are very grateful for that unplanned entrance.

'I was shocked but I mean, really, I think back on it and I was, like, who else can really top that kind of wedding entrance?' said Julia.

'It’s something me and my friends and family will never ever forget.'
