Sir Ian Botham’s attack on the leadership of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has drawn a massive response from Mail on Sunday readers, who say they feel ‘betrayed’ by an organisation they have backed for years.

The England cricketing legend, who fronts You Forgot The Birds, a new grassroots campaign, wrote a devastating open letter to the charity in The Mail on Sunday last week. A small selection of the postbag received by this newspaper in response is reproduced below.

One reader said that having joined the RSPB as a founder member aged 16, he was now resigning. Another said she was also quitting because of the charity’s decision to install a wind turbine near its reserve in Bedfordshire.

Since the Mail on Sunday ran the story, the You Forgot The Birds website has attracted 25,000 hits.

Now a new front in the campaign has opened up following the RSPB’s decision to block measures designed to help one of country’s rarest and most iconic birds – the hen harrier.

Threat: The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has blocked a plan to protect both hen harriers, right, and grouse, left

There are only four breeding pairs left in England which, says the RSPB, is because they have been ‘persecuted’ by gamekeepers as they eat grouse chicks.

Since 1998, the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) has been pushing for a compromise scheme that would protect both hen harriers and grouse – so allowing them, and the game bird industry on which many jobs depend, to co-exist. It is backed by landowners and other conservation groups.

The idea is known as ‘brood management’. Extra food would be provided on grouse moors for both species, and as harrier numbers recovered, the RSPB would work with gamekeepers to remove harrier chicks from the moors. They would be raised in an aviary, then released back into the wild.

But at a meeting involving all concerned parties last week, the RSPB refused to endorse the removal of chicks, although it does support the provision of extra food.

Martin Harper, the RSPB’s conservation director, said the society opposed the scheme because the grouse moor industry could not be trusted. He said: ‘The industry has to prove that it can deliver the recovery of hen harriers before we can even consider brood management. If chicks were taken from the wild, reared and released, we have little confidence that they would be allowed to fly free from harm.’

The RSPB’s opposition drew a withering response from Sir Ian. He said: ‘The RSPB has once again wilfully blocked the government’s plan for the recovery of hen harriers. More and more people are realising that the hen harriers’ biggest enemy is the RSPB – not rogue gamekeepers.’

Andrew Gilruth, a spokesman for the GWCT, said that industry bodies such as his ‘utterly condemn any illegal killing, anywhere’.
