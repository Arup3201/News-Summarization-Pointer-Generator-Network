There's nothing Matthew Jukes hates more than a dull wine. Actually, there's also 'nipping' (more of which later), supermarket wine buyers  and an untidy sock drawer.

Award-winning wine writer Matthew is a meticulous man who likes everything in its place – which, for 97 per cent of wines currently on sale in Britain, he says, is down the plughole.

'A lot of wine is boring as sin,' he says. 'I only write up three per cent of the wines I taste, the rest are awful. If you can't inject personality or passion into a bottle of wine, why are you doing it? I tasted more than 4,000 bottles to find 200 for my wine collection.'

Matthew has tasted more than 4,000 bottles of wine for his collection of 200

He's referring to his 200 finest-value wines in the UK today, which we're giving away as a guide in Weekend Magazine this week and next.

'I had to kiss a lot of frogs to find the right bottles,' he says. 'Waitrose and Sainsbury's wines are pretty good this year, but Asda is shocking. Supermarket buyers are now bean counters. They're not talented palates. It's all about making money. It's not about finding an incredible wine and launching it onto the market. That's all gone.'

Surely he's not referring to those half-price gems we pile into our trolleys? 'That's nonsense,' he says. 'The price it's reduced to is one they're still making the right margin at. So, invariably, it's an inflated price beforehand. It's naughty.' He shakes his head in despair.

Matthew, 46, is passionate about wine - good wine enjoyed with food, not the cheap 'boring stuff' you stick in the fridge door and 'nip away at' to unwind.

He's referring to the trend among middle-class women of so-called oblivion-drinking to blot out stress. 'By the time the husband comes home from work, you've had a bottle. I think it's pretty desperate. My mantra is that wine tastes better with food and food tastes better with wine. Don't nip away at a bottle when you're just pottering – and I never, ever drink on my own.'

Matthew tastes 40,000 bottles of wine a year

Hang on Matthew, you're paid to taste 40,000 bottles of wine a year, surely you get unsteady on your feet at the end of a heavy day? 'God no,' he says with such horror I might as well have suggested we share a bottle of Blue Nun.

'I don't drink them all. I spit them out at work. Outside of work we have dinner parties, cook and taste lots of different bottles. It's about flavours. You often pour away what's left if you've not finished the glass, to taste the next one. It's a bit nerdy, but fun and...' And he's off, enthusing about the wonders of the sort of wine you don't stick in the fridge and nip.

But the thing about Matthew is he makes it so understandable to those of us who don't know our sancerre from our sauvignon blanc.

Which is how he's made his name as one of the most influential voices in the wine world. 'I have a big mouth and lots of energy,' he says. 'I don't believe there's such a thing as a natural palate. I could teach you to be a great taster. It's about practice and memory.

'I use a lot of imagery. For example, a gorgeous woman would be a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley. The sun doesn't beat down as hard there as it does in Chile or New Zealand. It's going to give you a tang on the palate and a nice smell like the perfume of a girl who wanders up and gives you a “wow”. It's about the shape, the curves, the length, the beauty and the finesse of the wine.'

What about a bunny boiler? 'Grapes from the Rhone Valley further south in France. They enjoy getting ripe and full of sugar and you can ferment them up to 15 per cent alcohol so you've got a white wine that has the alcohol of a butch red wine. They rush up to you and you haven't got any control over how it hits you. The memory is hazy – “Did I like it? I'm not sure” – and the hangover is dreadful.'

Crikey, he seems to know as much about women as wine. Matthew, who has two daughters from an earlier marriage, adores his wife Amelia. If she were a wine, he says, she'd be a Chambolle-Musigny Premier Cru Les Amoureuses, Roumier, Burgundy, because 'of the heavenly flavour of the pinot noir, the romantic vineyard name and the fact I bought a bottle of it to drink the day after we got married'.

They married four years ago after meeting at a wine tasting. Amelia was 'a bit of a nipper but I've persuaded her over to my side'. He's had less joy organising her sock drawer. Matthew, as I've said, likes everything in its place.

During the hour-and-a-half we've been talking he's lined up all the cutlery on the table like soldiers on parade. 'Amelia gets infuriated by it. I'm super-tidy – OCD. I can't work until the house is perfect.' It must be perfect all the time then, as he's a prodigious worker who's published 14 books.

Matthew's passion for wine began at the age of eight when his family were living in Belgium. His father was the European head of the huge multinational ITT Corporation and his mother a brilliant cook who entertained regularly at home.

Matthew chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in Barnes and by 22 he'd been hired as wine buyer for Chelsea's Bibendum restaurant

'We had an entrance hall with a staircase that went round in a circle and a balcony at the top. I'd be there in my dressing gown, pyjamas and little slippers watching these top people come in. I'd say hello and then pour the wine. I remember being given a taste and reading the labels. I was fascinated with labels because I figured out that was the birth certificate of the wine. I'd look up the vineyards in an atlas and see the villages where these wines came from.'

At ten he went to the Oratory School in Berkshire where he discovered rugby, beer and girls, but his passion for wine persisted. 'I had a fridge in my room with wine in it and always entertained  - particularly girls.'

After school he began to  study physics at Queen Mary's in London, where a master noted he was 'not much of a physicist, quite a good rugby player and a hell of a wine snob'.

He chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in Barnes and by 22 he'd been hired as wine buyer for Chelsea's Bibendum restaurant. The next year it won Best Restaurant Wine List in the country. He remains as enthusiastic today.

'Wine is an ever-changing subject. Every 12 months, every wine made is in a bottle and trundling off into the world, and new versions are being made. It never stops.'Neither, it seems, does Matthew.
