Women in society are judged by their looks while men are judged by what they say, according to TV presenter Claire Balding.

The broadcaster said that this is having a ‘pervasively negative’ effect on society as a whole.

Ms Balding told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We look at women and we judge, whereas we listen to men and we judge. Their voice as in what they say is stronger than their look.

Clare Balding has spoken out about how women are treated in society. She says that they are judged on their looks, not on what they have to say

‘That’s in every walk of life, not just the media. And it has a pervasively negative effect seeping through everything.’

The 42-year-old also discussed how women are treated in television, adding that older women are often personally criticised for their look or how they dress.

A recent study found that out of 481 presenters on BBC, Sky, ITN and Channel  5 only 26 were women over 50.

She also used veteran television personalities John Humphries and Andrew Neil as men who are not judged by their looks because they know what they’re talking about.

Ms Balding, who recently won a Bafta, also added that she has been criticised for how she looked, but that she tries not to let it affect her.

She said: ‘I know that when I’m on TV, I’ll get a lot of comments about my personal appearance. It’s demoralising but it shouldn’t be destructive.’

Arlene Phillips was replaced on Strictly Come Dancing by younger Alesha Dixon

Ms Balding is the daughter of the Queen’s ex-horse trainer Ian Balding, and is civil partners with Alice Arnold, a Radio 4 newsreader who has also spoken out against age discrimination in TV.

In 2011 former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won a case for age discrimination. She was one of four presenters aged over 40 to be dropped from the show.

The 63-year-old newsreader Moira Stewart was also dropped from her role, and Arlene Phillips, then 66, was famously fired from Strictly Come Dancing to be replaced by Alesha Dixon.
