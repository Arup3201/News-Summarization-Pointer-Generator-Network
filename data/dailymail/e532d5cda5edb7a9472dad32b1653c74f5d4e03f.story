Japan Airlines has reported a fuel leak in a Boeing 787 Dreamliner for the second time in a week amid a U.S. safety review of the aircraft.

Narita International Airport outside of Tokyo says JAL reported a 100-liter fuel leak in a 787 during an inspection Sunday. The aircraft reportedly was the same one that had a fuel leak in Boston last week.

Japan's All Nippon Airways has experienced a fuel leak, a cockpit window crack and a computer malfunctioning in its 787s, causing cancellations of several domestic flights.

High tech: The 787 Dreamliner relies more than any other modern aircraft on electrical signals to help power nearly everything the plane does. But it has suffered a multitude of problems in the last week

The 787 is Boeing's newest and most high-tech airliner. Japanese airlines are among the top 787 customers.

The U.S. government said Friday the 787 is safe to fly, although last week federal regulators ordered a comprehensive review last week into the cause of various problems and scares in a matter of days.

The Federal Aviation Administration finally launched the probe after a crack appeared in a cockpit window during a domestic All Nippon Airways flight in Japan on Friday.

The review is an embarrassing setback
to the plane that was heralded as the future of aviation, after four 
separate malfunctions occurred last week alone, including a brake 
failure, a fuel leak and an on-board fire.

Concern: Last Sunday, another 787 caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston

Trouble: Last Monday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport (pictured: the fire that broke out the day before)

The FAA says the review will include the design, manufacture and assembly of the aircraft.

Speaking of Friday's incident, ANA 
said crew noticed a spider web-like crack in a window in front of the 
pilot's seat about 70 minutes into Friday's flight, which was close to 
its destination.

'Cracks appear a few times every year
in other planes. We don't see this as a sign of a fundamental problem' 
with Boeing aircraft, a spokesman for the airline said.

January 13 2013 - Narita Airport in Tokyo reports a 100-liter fuel leak from a 787 during routine inspection.

January 11 2013 - A spider web-like crack appears in the cockpit windscreen of an All Nippon Airlines domestic flight to Tokyo.

January 9 2013 - All Nippon Airlines is forced to cancel
a domestic flight to Tokyo after a computer wrongly 
indicated a problem with the 787's brakes.

January 8 2013 - A fuel leak forces a Japan Airlines-operated 787 to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport.

January 7 2013 - A Dreamliner catches fire after dropping 
off 183 passengers and crew in Boston when a battery in the 
jet's auxiliary power system overheated.

The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, relies more than any other modern airliner on electrical 
signals to help power nearly everything the plane does.

It is also the first Boeing plane to use rechargeable lithium ion batteries and to be made with lightweight composite materials.

More
than 800 have been sold to airlines around the world, which Boeing has 
said will be more fuel efficient than comparable jets and more 
comfortable for passengers.

But the Dreamliner has flown under a 
cloud since its maiden voyage on in October 2011, which itself saw 
repeated delays lasting more than three years after a slew of faults 
were detected.

On Wednesday, All Nippon Airlines was forced to cancel
a domestic flight to Tokyo after a computer wrongly 
indicated a problem with the 787's brakes.

On Tuesday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines 
to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport.

And a day before that, another Dreamliner caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston when a battery in the jet's auxiliary power system overheated.

Nobody was hurt as passengers and crew had already disembarked.

But those were not the only issues that have blemished the much-vaunted launch of air travel's latest addition.

In December United Airlines' brand-new Dreamliner, carrying 174 passengers and 10 crew, was forced to make an 
emergency landing in New Orleans due to a mechanical issue.

In the same month, Qatar Airways grounded one of its Dreamliners after 
several similar faults caused electrical problems.

But the airline's image has been besieged by a string of other problems that began long before its inaugural flight.

In
July last year, debris from a brand-new Dreamliner's engine sparked a 
fire at a South Carolina airport forcing emergency crews to close the 
Charleston International Airport for more than an hour.

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board uncovered cracks in the forward end of a fan midshaft in one of its engines.

And an incident in February 2012 saw Boeing report signs of 'delamination' occurring on a support structure in the Dreamliner's rear fuselage, launching an inspection.

It is the first large-scale commercial aircraft made 50 per cent from 'composite materials' including plastics and carbon fiber and experts believe it could bring an end to the 'aluminium age'.
