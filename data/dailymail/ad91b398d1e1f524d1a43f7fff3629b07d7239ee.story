If you're one of those people who dithers over classic Dairy Milk, textured Fruit & Nut or crunchy Daim when choosing chocolate, all your woes may be about to come to an end.

For the first time in its history Cadbury's is set to release a super bar containing not one but seven different fillings.

The seven-row Dairy Milk Spectacular will contain one row each of: Dairy Milk Caramel, Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut, Dairy Milk Whole Nut, Dairy Milk Oreo, Dairy Milk Daim, and Dairy Milk Turkish.

For the first time in 100 years, Cadbury's is set to release a super bar containing seven different fillings

But don't get too excited as there are only 50 on offer. 

And what's more, you won't find them in your corner shop or local supermarket as the bars were created for a competition. 

The Cadbury team worked alongside food artist Prudence Staite to create the bar in in a bid to get chocolate lovers to try something new. 

The brand had conducted research which showed that Britons can be hesitant to try new flavours and created the bar which includes their seven 'core flavours.'  

The Dairy Milk Spectacular will contain one row each of: Dairy Milk Caramel, Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut, Dairy Milk Whole Nut, Dairy Milk Oreo, Dairy Milk Daim, and Dairy Milk Turkish

Their study revealed we are more likely to try new flavours based on the recommendation of  loved ones – partners (36 per cent), family (25 per cent) or a close friend (24 per cent).

Matthew Williams, Marketing Director for Cadbury said: 'The special edition Cadbury Dairy Milk Spectacular 7 bar is our first chocolate treat to contain seven flavours. 

'We know our fans love the variety and taste in the range, so we've created the ultimate celebration of the magnificently delicious Cadbury Dairy Milk flavours.'
