A tourist who joined in the search after a member of her bus party went missing was able to help track the woman down - when she realised it was herself they were looking forward.

The woman was declared missing from a party touring the Eldgja volcanic region in south Iceland after getting off the party's bus to freshen up.

She only hopped off the bus breifly, but had also changed her clothes - and her fellow travellers did not recognise her when she climbed back on again to continue the party's journey.

The Asian woman had joined the search party for herself after being declared missing in the Eldgja volcanic region in south Iceland

Soon the search began for a woman described as Asian, around 160cm, in dark clothing and speaking English well,

When the details of the missing 
person were issued, the woman reportedly didn't recognise her own 
description and unwittingly joined the search party for herself.

After a night-long operation 
involving around 50 people, the 'missing woman' eventually realised she 
was the source of the search and informed police.

The search began on Saturday, but was 
called off at around 3am on Sunday morning when the woman, who has not 
been identified, realised she was the subject of the frantic efforts.
