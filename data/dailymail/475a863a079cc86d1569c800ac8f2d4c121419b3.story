Emile Heskey in training with Bolton in a picture shared by the club's official Twitter feed

Bolton Wanderers gave fans a tantalising glimpse of Emile Heskey in training with the club on Wednesday morning as Neil Lennon weighs up whether to sign the former England centre forward.

Heskey, 36, is hoping to impress Lennon and looked to be in good shape.

The Wanderers boss said in a press conference on Thursday: 'Emile is training hard. There is an Under 21s game (against Reading) on Monday and we're hoping to have a look at him in that.'

The fact Bolton's official Twitter feed shared a picture of him putting in the hard yards suggests a short-term deal could be on the cards.

Only last week Bolton re-signed club legend Eidur Gudjohnsen, also 36, until the end of the season with the Trotters facing a striker crisis.

Lennon was forced to deploy 19-year-old Conor Wilkinson  up front on his own in the draw against Ipswich on Saturday. 

First-choice target man Craig Davies is injured, as is fellow forward Joe Mason and on Thursday it was confirmed that Max Clayton will be out for six months. 

Gudjohnsen was brought on for half-an-hour at the Macron Stadium last weekend as he started his bid to gain match fitness.

But while Lennon's other attacking options lack experience, the Icelander and Heskey have 140 international caps between them.

'And about 100 years together as well,' Gudjohnsen joked last week. Their actual combined age is 72.

'He's a physical presence and you can still see it,' added Gudjohnsen of Heskey. 'There's not much changed in him. If he wants to play and if he's hungry to play then I'd love for him to be with us.

'Any bit of quality, any bit of experience, any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it's him or other players, we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other.'

Gudjohnsen is back at the club he first joined in 1998, aiming to experience a late-career renaissance having returned to these shores following short stints with Tottenham, Stoke and Fulham. 

Gudjohnsen embarked on an upward trajectory when he left Bolton in 2000, enjoying trophy-laden spells at Chelsea and Barcelona, but he has failed to settle since despite playing in France, England, Greece and Belgium.

Heskey, meanwhile, recently spent two years in Australia playing for Newcastle Jets. His top-flight career has seen him score 110 goals in 586 games for Leicester, Liverpool, Wigan Athletic, Birmingham City and Aston Villa.
