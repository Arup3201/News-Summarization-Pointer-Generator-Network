The world's first religious vending machine has been installed in a church to allow worshippers to buy holy accessories before attending a service.

Churchgoers can now buy rosary beads and armbands with religious motifs before taking their seat inside their place of worship.

The machine was the brainchild of pastoral assistant Sebastian Fiebig at 
the St. Joseph Church, in Hamburg, Germany.

Bright idea: Sebastian Fiebig stands in front of the vending machine which he designed to let worshippers buy religious accessories

He designed the machine and 
believes it is a fun idea.

The 39-year-old said: 'I walked passed
a vending machine for umbrellas a long time ago and it was then that I 
came up with the idea to make one for the church.

'I
purchased an old vending machine on the internet, repaired it, gave it a
new coat of paint and then filled it with the rosaries and armbands.'

After putting the money in the slot, a white cardboard box drops into your hands, and the wooden rosary is inside.

A wooden armband with religious motifs will set you back two euros and features images of Jesus, Maria and the Pope.

The rosaries, made from brown wooden 
beads with a metal cross, cost four euros to buy and instructions are 
attached explaining how to use them.

The brand new vending machine has had a positive response from the churchgoers, who visit regularly.

Mr Fiebig, who also lives in Hamburg, added: 'It is very popular and we often need to refill it.

'It is a big hit and people often buy more that one rosary at a time.

'The main thing is that it is a bit of fun, we are having fun with it and want to pass that onto other people.

'All
the money raised will go to our church camp for children, and if it 
leads to a small prayer here and there, that is even better.'
