An Ohio girl has been pulled out of the school  after being bullied for cutting off her hair to donate it to charity, her mother says.

Ten-year-old Jetta Fosburg of Dayton had long hair when she decided she would make a donation to Wigs for Kids that could be used to help young cancer patients who had lost their hair.

'I have some family members who have cancer so I thought it was the right thing to do,' she told Fox.

Bullied: Jetta was the target of a weeks of bullying from other students after donating her long hair to a charity supporting cancer patients

'Of course, we were super proud,' Jetta's mother Heidi Fosburg told WHIO. 'We thought it was the coolest idea that she came up with on her own.'

Chopping off 14 inches left Jetta with a short new hairstyle, but when she showed up at Pathway School of Discovery, her classmates started hurling hurtful insults at her.

'They said things like she wants to be a boy, she's ugly now, a lot of hurtful things,' her mother said.

Jetta tried to ignore the bullying, but as days wore on and nothing changed, her mother asked the school to step in.

She brought the issue to the principal, but his response according to Heidi was to tell the girl to 'tough it out.'

Though he said he would 'deal with it how he saw appropriate,' the principal would not step in more aggressively because 'he didn't know of any child that had ever died from words.'

Long: The donation yielded 14 inches of hair for Wigs for Kids and afterwards, Jetta decided to take her hairstyle even shorter

Snip-snip: Jetta's mother said neither of them realized that the haircut would have such a dramatic impact on the little girl's life

Support: A Facebook page created by Jetta's mother became a place for other people to share stories of being bullied and to voice support for Jetta

Eventually, Jetta's mother pulled her out of school because the weeks-long streak of bullying was taking its toll on her.

To try and lift her spirits, her mom started an anti-bullying Facebook page which has now received almost 14,000 likes.

Women have posted photos of themselves with their short hair and shaved heads in support of Jetta and other supporters have voiced encouragement.

'You just keep being yourself,' read one post from Tanna Rose Sherrill. 'Your actions speak louder and matter more to who you are as a person than any hairstyle ever could.' 

National Heritage Academies, which manages Pathway School of Discovery, a free charter school, says its looking into Jetta's mother's claims of bullying.
