A charity set up by Tony Blair has been the victim of a theft of more than £50,000.

The Tony Blair Faith Foundation revealed the ‘misappropriation’ in its latest accounts, which were published yesterday.

The money came out of Faith Acts, the charity’s programme to support malaria prevention in Sierra Leone over the past two years, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

A statement from the charity last night said: ‘Regrettably, we have to report a misappropriation of funds amounting to some £52,000. This came to light during a routine audit.

‘The loss will have minimal effect on the programme.’

Despite the theft, the charity – which employs 25 staff and works in 22 nations – increased its income to £2.6 million.
