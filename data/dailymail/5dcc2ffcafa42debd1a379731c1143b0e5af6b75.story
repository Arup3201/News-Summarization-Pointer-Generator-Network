Karen Danczuk is unrepentant about the cleavage baring selfies she posts on Twitter

The French have a rather charming phrase for a woman with a seriously impressive chest. She has, they say ‘beaucoup de conversation’ – plenty to say for herself. And Britain’s most famous local councillor, MP’s wife Karen Danczuk, does indeed have plenty to say for herself, both literally and in the Gallic sense.

Today, her famous bust is like a Zeppelin; large, rigid, and heading skywards. It’s encased in a 34E bra but I think she’s bigger than that, way bigger. ‘I haven’t had myself measured. I stick with an E because those bigger sizes, the Fs and Gs...’ She drops her voice conspiratorially. ‘They’re scary, right?’

Her bosoms are more familiar to her thousands of Twitter followers in a state of deshabille in a low- cut dress, vest-top or bikini. Her passion for selfies has seen her post a summer’s worth of pictures, which have made her – or rather her deep, caramel-coloured cleavage – an online star.

And because Karen Danczuk is wily and because political creatures need a high profile like they need to breathe oxygen, she’s seized the kind of opportunity for advancement enjoyed by busty girls since Nell Gwyn got ’em out for Charles II.

She’s now a fully paid-up member of both the Labour Party and the Twitterati. But is she too much of a Twitter-tarti for us to take her seriously – and is this storm in an E-cup the electoral strategy of a Westminster wannabe? I headed to Rochdale, her husband’s constituency, to ask.

‘I did not think “I’ll post some selfies and have a publicity hit,”’ she tells me. ‘I don’t look at myself and think, “Oooh, Karen, you’re gorgeous.” I don’t have the confidence or the arrogance people think I do.

‘I’m not fame-hungry. I just take selfies going about my business like millions of others. The only time I show my chest off is if I’m going out, dressed up on Friday night, when I’m not Councillor Karen or Businesswoman Karen, I’m just being myself. And that’s allowed. Anyway, if I had to pick my best feature I’d say I quite like my eyes.’

Among those who would beg to differ are the lads’ mags that have offered her significant amounts of money to pose topless. But she’s not interested.

‘You’ll not be seeing my assets on the front of a magazine any time soon.’ And she’s unrepentant about the controversy she has caused. ‘I’m a woman, I have boobs and if you want to talk to them you can, or you can talk to my brain. I’m not a feminist who’s furious.’

No, indeed, I’d say she was thrilled and is working out how to parlay her chest’s popularity into a proper political career. She half-admits as much when she says: ‘I’m honoured by all the support I’ve had and I do not underestimate the benefits of it all.’ A classic politician’s answer.

Karen is the wife of the Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, whose plain-talking on issues such as immigration and whose investigation into child sex abuse and the grooming scandals in his constituency has made him a figure of influence. So how does he feel about it all?

A typical picture posted on Twitter by Mrs Danczuk - for which she has been heavily criticised 

‘Rochdale has given us Gracie Fields, Lisa Stansfield and Anna Friel. We have a fine reputation for supporting glamour and Karen is a very smart-looking woman. Besides,’ he twinkles, ‘I am quite happy to see her cleavage. Why wouldn’t I be?’

Not everyone has been, though. Karen was ambushed live on ITV’s Loose Women last week and told by Janet Street-Porter that she was a bad role model for young women. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has also accused Karen’s ‘memorable mammaries’ of cheapening the work of women in politics, labelling her Westminster’s ‘most embarrassing wife’. This, Karen attributes, to old-fashioned class war.

‘I still come across snobbery,’ she says. ‘I face people like Louise Mensch who believe you should know your place in society. Well, we’re all different and I believe a Labour Government would speak more widely and warmly to people like me. I am Labour. I define myself as “working-class Karen” and I will never forget my roots. Because I lead a middle-class life, some would argue than I should now be a Tory voter but I would never flip.’ She and Simon live with their two sons – Maurice, four and Milton, six – in a modest three-bedroom bungalow. (No duck-house here.)

When I arrive Simon is in the kitchen with a pinny protecting his pinstripes, making a vat of Lancashire stew between political appointments. Karen who, at 31, is 16 years his junior, appears from the bedroom, with her curlers still in.

She is also wearing a sensible cream shift dress, along with a navy jacket and pearls, and looks rather more matronly than her girlish, carefully curated selfies – she has perfected the art of the doe eye and dropped chin – would suggest. But the voice, the views, and the rhino hide as far as criticism is concerned, feel authentic. She is a devoted Catholic, plays the violin and the piano, and makes a legendary Sunday roast.

She and Simon have been together seven years. They met after he separated from his first wife, by whom he also has two children. However, the pair did not divorce until Karen was pregnant with Milton.

I would like to ask: ‘So Karen, what first attracted you, a Labour activist with political ambitions, to the town’s much-admired MP?’ But I can’t because he wasn’t an MP back then and she wasn’t a councillor. Or even on Twitter. And he was only her second serious boyfriend.

‘I was never fussed about men, I was too independent,’ she says. ‘We met – corny – at Rochdale Labour Club, went for a drink and clicked. When I found out I was pregnant I was in shock for nine months.’ They married two years ago.

Twitter is what Karen does to relax. She’s been on it for two years but it was a cheeky selfie of her eating a bacon sandwich after the Ed Miliband bacon buttie disaster which led newspapers and political gossip websites to her Twitter feed.

‘I love Twitter – it’s a creative way of expressing who we are and what we do,’ she says.

‘I don’t plan my selfies, they’re taken in the moment. I’ve no intention of changing myself – I’d be letting myself down. What you see in those photos, that’s me. I’m more than an MP’s wife, I’m also a businesswoman and a mum.’

The question is: does she want to be an MP too? ‘Will I go down that route? Maybe in ten years’ time. But I’m not a career politician. I do this [local politics in Rochdale] because I care. I’m more than capable but I have two small boys, and I can’t just up and leave them.’

Ten years will give her time to mature politically because, as she admits, ‘right now I float around in my views. I’m Labour for ever but the party needs a firmer vision, clearer policies. Because we are not clear, even I can’t tell you what I agree and disagree with’. However, she goes on to demand a cap on immigration and a review of the party’s commitment to the minimum wage. Ten years will also give her time to post a lot more selfies.

Do I think she has the chutzpah to be an MP? Definitely.

Would I want her as mine? No, but give her time.

Karen Danczuk’s greatest political skill thus far has been reflecting herself well in the hall of mirrors that is social media. I prefer my politicians to be more substantial.

And I don’t mean in their bra size.
