Hollywood legend Olivia de Havilland was today 'in mourning' over the death of her equally famous sister Joan Fontaine

Hollywood legend Olivia de Havilland was today ‘in mourning’ over the death of her equally famous sister Joan Fontaine, telling friends: ‘I’ll never forget her’.

The Oscar-winning actress is now almost 97, and living in an upmarket apartment block close to the Arc de Triumphe in Paris.

She and her sister were notorious for their bitter quarrels, and barely spent any time together during their long and successful screen careers.

But on Monday Ms De Havilland issued a statement saying she was ‘shocked and saddened’ by Joan’s death on Sunday at the age of 96.

‘Joan was her kid sister – of course she’s hugely sad at her passing,’ said one of Ms De Havilland’s friends in the French capital.

‘She’s certainly in mourning and has made it clear that she will never forget Joan.’

Olivia has been bombarded with flowers and letters since Sunday night, and said in her statement that she was overwhelmed by ‘the many kind expressions of sympathies.’

Ms De Havilland and Ms Fontaine, who lived in California at the time of her death, were among Hollywood's most famous sisters.

Both were nominated for the best actress Oscar in 1941, and Ms Fontaine won it for her role in the film ‘Suspicion’.

Recalling the awards ceremony many years 
later, Ms Fontaine said: ‘All the animus we'd felt toward each other as 
children, the hair pullings, the savage wrestling matches, the time 
Olivia fractured my collarbone, all came rushing back in kaleidoscopic 
imagery.

‘My paralysis was total. I felt Olivia would spring across the table and grab me by the hair.

'I felt age 4, being confronted by my older sister. Damn it, I'd incurred her wrath again!’

Ms
 De Havilland is hugely respected in France, and was awarded the Legion 
of Honour by the then President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010.

She won two Oscars in all, including one for her part in in the 1947 film ‘To Each His Own’.

Joan Fontaine (left) said the sibling rivalry was encouraged by their ambitious stage mother. It may have also had something to do with their similarity (the photo on the right, for example, is of Olivia de Havilland)

When
 Fontaine tried to congratulate her for the 1947 award, Ms De Havilland 
ignored her, with a spokesman saying: ‘This goes back for years and 
years, ever since they were children.’

Ms
 Fontaine once told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘I married first, won the 
Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she’ll undoubtedly be livid
 because I beat her to it.’
