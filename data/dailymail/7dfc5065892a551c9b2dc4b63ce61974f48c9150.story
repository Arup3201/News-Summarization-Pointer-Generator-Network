As a passionate supporter of women's rights, British actress Thandie Newton jumped at the chance to visit Ghana to support a charity campaign - even though the trip fell just a few months after she had given birth to her son, Booker.

The 41-year-old told MailOnline that her trip to the country earlier this year was 'humbling' and 'fascinating'.

She said: 'I felt strongly about going as I knew so much could be achieved with a short trip. I have always worked when my babies are small. 

'I carried on breastfeeding through the trip and I'm lucky I have a husband [British director Ol Parker] who is a committed new dad and my mum is up the road. I also have two little mums in the shape of my two daughters [Ripley, 14 and Nico, 10].

Right to be born healthy: Thandie Newton travelled to Ghana to see how a charity project is helping prevent the spread of HIV to a new generation

Making friends: The actress said she felt an instant kinsmanship with the people she met during her visit

The BAFTA-winning actress travelled to Ghana to see how Galaxy is making a difference to the lives of people in Africa by teaming up with the charity (Red).

Five pence from every bar of (Galaxy)RED chocolate sold goes to the hospitals, maternity wards and clinics that Thandie visited, where staff are working to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to their babies.

Thandie said: 'I saw first-hand how they are trying to bring an AIDS-free generation into being. I had no idea that a woman could prevent passing on the disease to her child by taking intravenous drugs during pregnancy. 

'I met one woman who was late getting to the clinic so her baby was born with HIV but they are able to now give the baby drugs so there is a strong chance he can be cured.'

As well as being a charity ambassador and mother-of-three, Thandie is also currently busy working on TV show Rogue, which has been a hit in the U.S. and is soon coming to the UK, plus another show West World - yet to be aired.

She said being a busy working mother isn't tiring - in fact, she's never felt better.

'It's a busy time but even though I have just had a baby, I feel really energised and in the prime of my life,' she said. 'I felt the same after having my first two children.' 

'I think one of the reasons is because during pregnancy I have been eating healthily and living really well, not smoking or drinking or doing all the things you associate with not being good to your body.' 

Being a mother meant Thandie felt an instant 'kinship' with the women she met in Ghana even though their lifestyles are seemingly quite different.  

'I showed them my baby pictures and I met their babies, I felt like I was with my girlfriends back home,' she said. 'I could really identify with the women I met, maybe I have a few pairs of Louboutins more but I don't know if that makes me any happier than they are.'

The clinic Thandie visited, which is helping to treat pregnant women with HIV, would not have been created with the support of charities like (Red).

Pleasurable donation: Simply by buying a bar of chocolate, you can help the people in Ghana who Thandie met

Thandie said: 'Five years ago there was no maternal clinic. It started being run out of a corridor but is not a thriving part of the maternity hospital. Women are becoming more empowered, more aware and less stigmatised.

'I left feeling excited and optimistic and honoured to have been around people who give us an example of what they can do to change the face of a disease that has been the blight on our landscape for 20 years with limited funds.' 

Although medical intervention is helping, it is estimated 150,000 people are infected with HIV in Ghana.

Thandie said something as simple as having access to an HIV test can make a huge difference.

She said: 'I saw someone having an AIDs test and it took less than ten minutes but it can change the course of someone's life. 

'If they don't know they have it, they could infect other people or have a child with it so just being tested can have a fundamental effect on a community.' 

While recent charity campaigns have seen people chucking buckets of ice water over themselves or daring to bare their faces on social media in no make-up, the project Thandie is advocating is far more pleasurable. 

All you have to do is buy a Special Edition (Galaxy)RED chocolate bar and you could end up saving a life.

As Thandie explains: 'Ghana is a country which has made great progress in reducing the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and, while there is still much work to be done, it shows the world the very real possibility of creating an AIDS free generation. This campaign enables people in the UK to help "Make Lives Better" through the simple action of buying a (Galaxy)RED bar.' 

(Galaxy)RED chocolate is on sale now, with 5p from each pack going to The Global Fund to help ensure that more mothers can have HIV-Free babies. For more information, visit www.galaxychocolate.co.uk.
