British pop star Phil Collins has handed over his vast collection of artifacts related to the Battle of the Alamo and the Texas Revolution to the state of Texas.

Collins was in San Antonio on Tuesday to donate what's considered the world's largest private collection of Alamo artifacts. It includes a fringed leather pouch and a gun used by Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie's legendary knife and letters from garrison commander William B. Travis.

'There's things in there that will make your mouth drop,' Collins said.

The 1980s pop artist and Genesis singer-drummer has joked that he spent all the money he made from music on artifacts related to the 1836 battle in which 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans.

The collection was given to Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, the state steward of the Alamo who is pushing for a new historical center that would house Collins' collection.

'Texans are deeply indebted to Phil Collins,' Patterson said.Â 

'He is giving us back our heritage. Now these Texas treasures need a home where all can see them and study from them and learn about how Texans won our liberty.'

Grammy and Academy Award winner Collins has donated a collection of more than 200 items for display. Five crates full of artifacts were unloaded from a cargo truck on Tuesday.

'This completes the journey for me. I'm 64. When I was 5 or 6 years old, this thing began,' Collins said of his fascination with the Alamo.

Collins said he became fascinated by the Alamo while watching Fess Parker star as 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier,' while he was a small child growing up in suburban London.

'My 9-year-old son was saying, "Why are you going to give it all away, Dad? I thought I was going to have it,'" he said with a laugh.

Patterson said it will likely take at least five years to raise the millions of dollars needed to design and build a center to house and display the collection.

Collins gained global fame in the 1980s with huge hits including In The Air Tonight, Take Me Home and Another Day In Paradise

The location of the center will be decided in about two weeks, Patterson said, and will likely charge for admission. The 4.2-acre Alamo grounds are free to the public.

'This collection is coming home and it's going to be very interesting for people to come and see and learn,' Collins said. 'And this is what it's all about.'

Collins first became known as drummer and lead vocalist for the rock group Genesis, later winning global fame as a solo artist with huge hits in the 1980s including In The Air Tonight, Take Me Home and Another Day In Paradise.

For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events.

Celebrated in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty.

The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett, already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting.

News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!'

The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas.

The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill.

It has since been the subject of a host of Hollywood movies, including a 1960 John Wayne epic and a 2004 version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton.
