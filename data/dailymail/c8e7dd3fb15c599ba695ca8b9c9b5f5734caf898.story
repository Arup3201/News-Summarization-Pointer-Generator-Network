The somnolent start to India’s tour was rudely interrupted at Grace Road yesterday by an injury scare to one of their most important batsmen.

Shikhar Dhawan, the star of India’s Champions Trophy triumph last year, was struck a nasty blow on the arm by the most impressive member of Leicestershire’s second-string attack on an otherwise carefree day of batting.

Atif Sheikh, a left-arm seamer of some pace but only one first-class match, kept India’s formidable line-up on their toes and forced Dhawan to retire hurt in this warm-up game when he hit him on the elbow after he had reached 60.

Agression: Atif Sheikh, who has only ever played one first class match, was a thorn in the tourists' side

Worry: Shikhar Dhawan receives treatment after being hit on the arm by a Sheikh delivery

Retired hurt: Dhawan left the field after the incident but India insisted his retirement was not forced

India later insisted that Dhawan was fine and was about to retire anyway, in keeping with a practice-game philosophy familiar to observers of India coach Duncan Fletcher’s dismissive approach to tour matches.

Yet it was still reminiscent of the incident this time last year when a rapid left-arm bowler in Tymal Mills struck England’s Graeme Swann a nasty blow in a warm-up match at Chelmsford and almost put him out of the Ashes.

Only this time it was an opposition player who was undone by friendly fire.

Certainly England will not want the flamboyant Dhawan, who smashed 187 off 174 balls on his Test debut against Australia, to arrive at Trent Bridge for the first Test on July 9 with too many runs and form under his belt.

To that end Sheikh, who gained considerable pace and movement with the new ball, will have pleased England no end by ruffling Dhawan’s feathers and generally keeping India’s batsmen honest on a day when they cruised to 333-4.

Runs: Virat Kohli looked good during his 49-ball stay at the crease, but was bowled for 29

Solid: Cheteshwar Pujura was one of two players to retire out after making it to a half-century

On the pull: Ajinkya Rahane finished the day 47 not out as Leicestershire caused the tourists few problems

The Nottingham-born left-armer played a single first-class game for Derbyshire before running into disciplinary problems with England Under 19s and then embarking on a nomadic search for a new county that has ended with him trying to establish himself at Grace Road.

On this evidence Leicestershire, bottom of Division Two without a victory this season, should give him a go.

Other than Sheikh, 23, there was not a lot to trouble an India team who had rendered this opening match non-first-class by insisting on using all 18 members of their squad over the three days, starting with a team of batsmen yesterday.

In the circumstances Leicestershire did well to take the wickets they did, with Murali Vijay falling to a catch by Angus Robson, younger brother of Sam, and Virak Kohli being bowled by a beauty from Shiv Thakor.

Rare breakthrough: Kohli was bowled by Shiv Thakor playing a loose shot but India dominated

Disappointment: Kohli missed the chance to get some early runs on a tour where India could trouble England

Other than that it was a tale of retirements, with Gautam Gambhir and Cheteshwar Pujara both calling it a day soon after reaching 50 and Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma then helping themselves to some easy runs.

India made a bigger splash off the field yesterday when Narayanaswami Srinivasan was confirmed as the first chairman of the International Cricket Council despite being barred from his role as president of the Indian board by the Supreme Court of India.

Driving away: Guatam Ghambir plays a good shot as India piled on the runs against Leicestershire

Rising force: Dhawan, who averages almost 50 in his seven tests, looked in good form before getting hurt

The elevation of Srinivasan is part of the controversial ‘power grab’ of the world game by the boards of India, England and Australia and comes even though he has been forced out of power, for now at least, in his home country as part of an investigation into corruption in the Indian Premier League.

Moeen Ali, who struck a maiden Test century of high class in a losing cause at Headingley on Tuesday, is the only member of the England team beaten by Sri Lanka who will feature in county cricket ahead of the first Test against India.

The other players, including under pressure captain Alastair Cook, will prepare for Trent Bridge in a two-day training camp at Loughborough next Tuesday and Wednesday instead.
