A six-month-old baby girl died this morning after she was shot five times in Chicago during an attack on her father - just months after her mother was shot and wounded while she was still in the womb.

The murder of little Jonylah Watkins - who was the victim of gun violence twice before she was even a year old - has horrified even a city where shootings have become commonplace. The news sent shock waves throughout the country.

Jonylah was hit in her lungs, her liver, her leg, her shoulder and her bowel when a gunman opened fire in broad 
daylight on Monday in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago as her father Jonathan Watkins changed her diaper.

Mr Watkins, 29, an alleged gang member, was the target of the attack. He was shot twice, but survived and is in critical condition at the hospital.

Tragedy: Jonylah 's murder has shocked Chicago - a city where gun violence in some neighborhoods has become routine

'This morning, the baby passed away,' the Reverend Corey Brooks, a family spokesman, told the Chicago Tribune.

'We have another tragedy in the city of Chicago.'

Jonylah underwent several hours of surgery at Comer Children's Hospital at the University of Chicago as doctors frantically tried to save her life.

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the shooting appears to be gang-related, though detectives don't have a specific motive.

Despite the shocking crime, neighbors are refusing to cooperate with police.

'We don't have one individual who's stepping up to help us,' McCarthy said.

Chicago continues to struggle with devastating gun violence at some of the highest rates in the nation.

The city had 57 murders in January and February - including 43 in January alone, the most violent month in a decade.

The number grabbed national headlines at a time when Congress was debating tougher gun control laws.

Many - if not most - of the killings are the result of gang-related violence that is largely concentrated on the city's south side.

The 43 murders in January in Chicago compare to just 24 in New York for the same month - despite the Big Apple being three times the size of the Windy City.

The killing of Jonylah Watkins is only the latest high-profile Chicago murder to shock the nation.

Just days after she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was killed on the street near her home.

Still, there is good news. In February the city charged just 14 murders - the lowest number since 1957.

Mr Watkins told the Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital room that he was devastated by the death of his infant daughter.

'I was trying to help. I was trying to help. I was trying to help her,' he said, breaking down.

Still, he claims he has no idea who shot him or why he was targeted.

The shooting on Monday comes months after her mother Judy, 20, was hit by a gunman when she was pregnant with Jonylah.

Her family said Mrs Watkins was hit in the knee when she was eight months pregnant as she walked home with a group of women.

She was at work at McDonald's when her daughter was fatally wounded on Monday.

In January and February this year, 57 people were killed in Chicago - most of them victims of gang-related shootings on the south side of the city.

Chicago gained national attention when its murders for January spiked to 43, the highest rate in years - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets.

In February killings dropped to 14 for the month - the lowest since 1957.

Reverend Brooks, the Watkins family spokesman, stood with Mrs Watkins outside the hospital after the baby's surgery.

He told DNAinfo: ‘This mother is really hurt. We need everyone in Chicago praying for this family right now.

Jonylah's family said she was hit in the lung, liver, shoulder, bowel and leg

'For a baby to get shot is despicable. Whenever anyone shoots a baby, that's a cowardly act.'

Police said Mr Watkins, 28 has links to the Gangster Disciples clique.

Mr Watkins’ family denies he has ties to gangs.

The gunman shot at the father and baby from an alley and hit Mr Watkins in the cheek and buttocks, Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli said.

The gunman then got into a nearby blue minivan and fled the scene, according to DNAinfo.

Dominique Young, 21, Mr Watkins' sister, said she heard the gunfire and arrived at the van within seconds to find the windows had been shot through.

She told DNAinfo: ‘They knew she was in there and they tried to take my niece's life, and it's so wrong.'

Rev Brooks' church New Beginnings Church of Chicago is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest.

The family have called on the 'cowardly' gunman to turn himself in.
