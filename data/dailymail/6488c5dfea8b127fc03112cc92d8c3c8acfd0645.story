Bridget Jones may be making a welcome return to our lives in one of the most anticipated books of the year, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy, but it's safe to say her iconic granny pants won't be if Agent Provocateur's sales are anything to go by.

The luxury lingerie label, known for its sexy underwear, saw its profit before taxes double in the past financial year proving that big pants are officially out.

The brand's revenue soared from £1,665,000 to £3,797,000, with sales increasing by 24.5 per cent.

The label, which has been fronted by the likes of Spanish sisters Penelope and Monica Cruz, expanded hugely in the past two years, opening 12 stores across the world.

Stores opened their doors in Milan, Hong Kong, Sydney and Montreal and Agent Provocateur plans to open up in Chengdu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Toronto and Calgary over next few months, The Telegraph reports.

The annual report announced: 'The directors continue to deliver a strategic growth plan for the expansion of the business both in the UK and internationally, with opportunities, to increase significantly the number of stores worldwide.

'While the global economic outlook still remains unsettled, particularly in Europe, the directors are satisfied that the business is in a very robust position to move forward.'

Agent Provocateur was founded in 1994 by Joseph Corré, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood's son, and his now ex-wife Serena Rees.

The debut store opened in Soho and has snapped up the likes of Melissa George from Home & Away, Kylie Minogue and Kate Moss to star in its campaigns.
