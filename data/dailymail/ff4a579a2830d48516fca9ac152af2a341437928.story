Tragedy: Owen Morris, 13, died suddenly after he collapsed during a warm-up job

A 13-year-old boy died while warming up to play rugby with his friends.

Owen Morris collapsed on a jog before for training with other teenagers in the under-14s team.

He was practising at Llanishen Rugby Club (LRC) in Cardiff on Monday ahead of a new season.

Owen was rushed to the University Hospital of Wales from the pitch, but he died the following morning.

The chairman of LRC emphasised Owen's love of the sport and described his death as 'a tragedy for his parents and for his coaches'

Dr Bryn Wilde said: 'It is an absolute tragedy for someone so young doing something he loved to do and looking forward to the next season with all his friends.

'It is really shocking. It is a tragedy for his parents and for his coaches.'

A statement posted on the Rugby Club's website offered further condolences for the player, who had been playing for them since he was in the under-8s team.

It described Owen as: 'A popular, well-liked and integral part of the Under 14 team this season.

'His brother Jake also plays for the Under 16s at Llanishen.

'The whole club especially the players, coaches and all parents of the Under 14s are completely devastated by this tragic event.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Owen's parents, family and friends.'

A minute's silence will also be held ahead of the the rugby club's games this weekend.

Sean O’Donovan, who is in Owen's school year, said: 'I’m still in shock, he was truly one of the nicest guys around.

'It’s going to be so weird not seeing the little man around school.'

Owen, who was from Cardiff, idolised rugby star George North, a winger for Wales and the British and Irish Lions, who posed for a picture with him last year.

The schoolboy was just about to start year nine at Cardiff High School. Following the tragedy the school's 1,500 pupils were being comforted by staff.

A spokesman for the school said: 'It was 
with great sadness that Cardiff High School has learned that a pupil has
tragically passed away.

'We offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends and will provide support to them and fellow pupils.

'The family has asked that their privacy is respected at this extremely sad time.'
