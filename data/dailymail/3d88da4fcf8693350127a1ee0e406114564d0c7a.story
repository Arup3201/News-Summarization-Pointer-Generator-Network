The CIA conducted a joint operation with Mossad to kill a Hezbollah leader in a car bomb attack, it has been revealed. 

Imad Mughniyah, the pro-Iranian group's international operations manager, was killed in Damascus in February 2008 after having dinner at a nearby restaurant.

The terrorist, dubbed the 'Osama Bin Laden of the eighties', was responsible for the deaths of more Westerners than any other militant until 9/11.

U.S. military is said to have built the bomb used in the attack, but did not execute it.

Militant leader: Imad Mughniyah, the pro-Iranian group's international operations manager, was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in February 2008 after having dinner at a nearby restaurant.

A former intelligence official told The Washington Post the device was tested more than 25 times in a North Carolina training facility before the covert operation took place.  

He had been involved in some of Hezbollah’s most spectacular terrorist attacks, including those against the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the Israeli Embassy in Argentina 

He also orchestrated the kidnap in Beirut of Terry Waite and other British hostages in the Eighties.

The nature of the attack suggest Mughniyah was a target of extremely high-importance. He was believed to have been directly involved in funding Shiite militias in Iraq that were targeting U.S. forces and had sat down with some of the Middle East's most powerful men - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

For many years he had a $20million U.S. bounty on his head and had plastic surgery to change his appearance - making it easier for him to get around. 

Explosion: A TV still shows the moment the vehicle the man  dubbed 'Osama Bin Laden' of the eighties was caught in the vehicle blast 

However the method may have breached international law.

Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame, told The Post: 'It is a killing method used by terrorists and gangsters. It violates one of the oldest battlefield rules.' 

One official said before they carried out the attack, they had to prove there was a 'continuous threat' to Americans' and a number of high-ranking officials - including President George W. Bush - would have had to sign off on it.  

At the time, a State Department spokesman said: 'The world is a better place without this man in it. He was a coldblooded killer, a mass-murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost.

'One way or another he was brought to justice.' 

Dangerous: Mughniyah is said to have been behind a number of terrorist attacks, including a bomb blast at the AMIA headquarters in Buerno Ares, Argentina - killing 85 people
