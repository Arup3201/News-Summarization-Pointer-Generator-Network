A deadly new legal high which has a similar effect to heroin could lead to a surge in deaths, ministers warned yesterday.

The emergence of synthetic opiates were becoming more of a problem in Britain than hard drugs, said Home Office Minister Norman Baker.

He said he was ‘shocked’ by the spread of so-called legal highs, which was a ‘major new challenge’ that risked killing or injuring many youngsters.

Mr Baker spoke out as he held a summit of experts to tackle the growing problem of substances which are developed in laboratories across the world.

‘Legal heroin’ has already cost one life in the UK.

Father-of-one Jason Nock, 41, died in August last year after overdosing on AH-7921 – a legal morphine-like drug bought on the internet for as little as £25 to help him sleep.

The 41-year-old computer technician, from
 Cradley Heath, West Midlands, accidentally took five times the fatal 
amount of the unregulated substance, known commercially as Doxylam, and 
never woke up.

Until now most legal highs have been 
designed deliberately to mimic existing banned substances, such as 
cocaine and Ecstasy, but chemically just outside the control of the 
Misuse of Drugs Act.

But now ministers are worried about the development of chemicals created to replicate the effects of other Class A drugs.

Mr Baker said: ‘The fact is there is a problem that hasn’t yet been dealt with satisfactorily, both in this country and elsewhere. And that’s a challenge which we collectively face.

‘In particular I’m concerned by the 
shocking emergence of new substances designed to have similar effects to
 heroin and synthetic opiates, one of which was reported last month to 
have caused the tragic death of Jason Nock.

‘We have a changing landscape in the drug world. The drugs which we have traditionally wrestled with, which have been there for decades if not longer, are now being added to by these new psychoactive substances.

‘It presents a challenge because if 
they are perceived to be legal and they suddenly arrive in our country 
before they have obviously been banned, then young people in particular 
can conclude that they are safe when they are nothing of the kind.’

He has now asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which advises the Government on whether a drug should be banned or reclassified, to study the developments.

Mr Baker has appointed experts in toxicology, policing, education, health and prevention onto the review panel into new psychotic substances.

He said the spread of legal highs was a ‘major new challenge’ and warned dozens of young people were dying or risked horrific injuries after experimenting with newly-designed chemicals.

Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton.

Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury.

But Mr Baker said: ‘If you’re having new substances created almost on a weekly basis then inevitably we’re chasing after those substances.’

He has also vowed to tackle the growing problem of ‘head shops’ which sell legal highs on the High Street.

Earlier this month the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from legal highs.

Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years.

In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death.

The Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring.

Meanwhile, a spike in violence at a prisone has been linked to use of the former legal high Spice.

Inspectors said HMP Blantyre House, in Kent, had seen a rise in incidents, including two serious assaults.

Inmates blamed the trouble on the synthetic cannabis drug - banned in 2009 - because it could induce paranoia and had led to debt and bullying.

Current drug tests do not detect Spice.
