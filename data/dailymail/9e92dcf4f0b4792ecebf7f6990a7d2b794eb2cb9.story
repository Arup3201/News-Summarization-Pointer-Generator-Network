Officers have arrested 21-year-old Matthew Ellery (pictured) on suspicion of theft 

A UKIP candidate handed his own son – a Ukip councillor – in to police after discovering valuable stock from his antiques shop had been stolen.

Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take Matthew Ellery to the police had been the most difficult of his life.

But he added that he hoped it would show he was capable of making hard choices and worthy of a seat at Westminster. Mr Stone is hoping to oust the disgraced former culture secretary Maria Miller in May. 

The father-of-four admitted he had a 'lump in his throat' as he apparently escorted the 21-year-old to the local police station. Officers arrested Ellery on suspicion of theft.

Mr Stone said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do but I would do it again. I took him to the police station, absolutely. I did what I had to do. The police are still investigating.' 

The grandfather added: 'I made a complaint about stock going missing – whether he stole it from me I do not know yet. I will stand by him when it is all over. He is my son.'

Ellery, who controversially won a place on Basingstoke and Dean Council last year, has been released on bail until after the election.

Mr Stone, who was announced as Ukip's candidate for Basingstoke last year, said he was hopeful of winning the seat despite the arrest.

'It is a family issue,' he said. 'It could be very positive. The fact that I am willing to take my own children to court if they do something wrong is a positive move. I am capable of taking the hard decisions if they are needed.'

The parliamentary candidate admitted his action had received 'mixed reactions' from the rest of his family, with some even suggesting the move was politically motivated. He added that he had not seen his son, who uses his mother's maiden name, for a week.

Ellery's election to his local council was shrouded in controversy, coming as it did after he caused outrage by branding the women in his town 'pug ugly' on social media. 

He also posted a message on Facebook saying that he 'felt like stabbing someone'.

Mr Stone went to the police three weeks ago after finding stock had been stolen from his shop Squirrel Antiques in Basingstoke over the last year. 

The businessman, who also runs Stone's Fine Jewellery in the Hampshire town, would not confirm the value of the theft but it is believed the items taken amount to tens of thousands of pounds.

Mr Stone said: 'The police do not know the exact figure. I know my stock has gone missing over the past year – of course I do.'

Hampshire police said: 'The 21-year-old arrested man has been re-bailed pending further enquiries. He's now due to return on bail on May 14.'

Basingstoke and Dean Council said it had not been informed of the arrest and Ellery had not been suspended.

Ukip refused to comment saying it was a family matter.
