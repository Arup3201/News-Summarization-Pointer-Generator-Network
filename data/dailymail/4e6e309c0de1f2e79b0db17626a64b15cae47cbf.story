The accident is still so vivid in my memory. It was a hot August bank holiday afternoon in 1994 and I was driving home from my niece's christening in South Wales.

I was tired – I'd just started a new job as head chef at Gidleigh Park Hotel in Devon and I'd been working long hours, keen to impress. My brother and his girlfriend had hitched a ride and were asleep on the back seat.

The last thing I remember is cruising along the outside lane of the M4 in Gwent. Then I nodded off and the car drifted to the inside lane, hit the barrier and careered back across the motorway, colliding with the central reservation.

The driver's side took the full impact before the car screeched along the central reservation, flipped onto its roof and span round several times. I'll never forget the sound of screeching metal. It was awful.

I woke on impact and began screaming, which woke up my brother and his girlfriend, who amazingly escaped with only superficial injuries. I wasn't so lucky.

As I hung upside down, held in place by my seatbelt, I noticed a hand on the floor. Then I checked my right arm and realised there was nothing from the elbow down. I must have gripped the steering wheel so tightly that my arm was ripped off when the car was thrown into the air.

I was losing a lot of blood but I just wanted to let go and die. My life was ruined. How could I continue cooking? I couldn't accept what had happened, so I wriggled out of the driver's side and began running – only to be met by other motorists who'd stopped to help urging me to lie down.

Luckily, one of them was a former military doctor, who stemmed the bleeding and urged me to stay awake to avoid slipping into a fatal coma. I wish I knew his name because he saved my life. Then a lady called Geraldine covered me with a blanket and urged me to think positive thoughts.

She made me realise there was more to life than work – such as family and friends. And at that point I decided that, at 25, I was too young to die.

Two weeks later I was back at work. Returning to the kitchen was tough, but I learned to delegate. If I couldn't chop a carrot, I'd ask someone else to do it.

Paul Henderson, my then boss, was also hugely supportive, helping me source a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm in America. Slowly I gained the confidence and skill to become the chef I wanted to be.

Nearly dying in that accident taught me to live life to the full. So I set myself goals – first to retain the hotel's existing Michelin star, then to secure another, which I did in 1999.

Now I'm aiming for a third. Since then there have been many milestones, such as gaining an MBE in 2006 and Gidleigh Park being voted No 1 in The Sunday Times Food List last year.

The accident made me a better man. I know what it's like to be reliant on those around you, and I believe in giving others the opportunities I was given. But I've never wanted pity: there's no room for that in my industry because to be the best you have to be good. You can't expect people to pay less because you only have one arm.
