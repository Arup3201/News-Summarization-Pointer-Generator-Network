The sprawling Palm Beach estate which the Kennedy clan migrated to when winter became too chilly in Washington can now be yours for a cool $38.5million.

It Florida mansion was nicknamed the 'winter White House' when President John F Kennedy, First Lady Jackie and their children came down for presidential holidays.

The home was first purchased by JFK's father Joseph Kennedy in 1933. Back then, the 11-bedroom Mediterranean Revival home cost just $120,000.

The home, set on two acres, was built in 1922 for the Philadelphia family who owned Redman Wanamaker stores. They named the home 'La Guerida' - the bounty of war.

It was designed by Addison Mizner whose Mediterranean-style homes are the epitome of Palm Beach architecture.Â 

Just 65 miles north of Miami, the home sits in a prestigious spot known as millionaire's row on the island of Palm Beach. It has sweeping ocean views, multiple second floor balconies along with a swimming pool and tennis court.

The lavish and yet homely interior can be seen here in a collection of shots on the website of realtor Linda R Olsson.

Joe Kennedy also added an additional wing to the house, designed by Maurice Fatio, the most popular society architect of the time.

The patriarch also had a 'bullpen' built at the property for his sole use - a walled off area where he sunbathed and could conduct his private business calls. The Kennedys spent many vacations at the 
Florida estate and many famous anecdotes about the powerful family are 
connected to the lavish home.

In the early years, it was where the young Kennedys were taught to swim by father Joe.

The fabulous home has unadulterated views to the Atlantic Ocean. The home has significant historic value being the site of where Kennedy wrote parts of his 1961 inaugural address

Joe and Rose Kennedy watched the 1960 Presidential election at the Palm Beach estate. After JFK's victory, he spent several weeks at the home, choosing his Cabinet and holding important meetings in an environment where he felt relaxed. It was also where he worked on his historic 1961 inaugural address.

The First Family's regular vacations to the Florida haven had the house nicknamed 'the Winter White House'. JFK was often seen playing golf at the Palm Beach Country Club or getting burgers at Hamburger Heaven. He attended St. Edward's Catholic Church with his mother Rose.

JFK spent a last few days at the Palm Beach home just before flying out to Dallas, Texas in November 1963, where tragedy would alter the course of history.

In 1991, the Florida compound also became associated with one of the Kennedy family's more infamous incidents.

William
 Kennedy Smith, JFK's nephew was accused of raping a 29-year-old woman 
during a moonlit beach stroll after drinking with a group including his 
uncle Senator Ted Kennedy and cousin Patrick Kennedy at a local bar.

Smith, then 30, testified that the pair had consensual and he was acquitted of all charges.

Following the scandal, in in 1995, with the death of matriarch Rose Kennedy at the age of 104, the family decided to let the property go.

Investment bank CEO John K Castle invested $6million in renovations for the home after buying it in 1995 for $4.9million. The home had still been without air conditioning or central heating.

At
 the time, most people in the area considered the property a 
'tear-down,' which would have freed up 173 feet of valuable Florida 
beachfront on which to build a more modern mansion.

However Mr Castle saw the estate as a 'national sanctuary' and even 
purchased some of the Kennedy's furniture to preserve inside the home.

Included
 in the $80,000 furniture deal, were beds used by Joseph, John, Bobby and
 Ted, an 18-foot dining table, JFK's massage table and a chest 
of drawers with labels handwritten by matriarch Rose Kennedy.

In the decades since the Kennedys enjoyed
 vacationing in the Florida sun, the power of the political dynasty's 
name has drive it up 320-fold (along with a little help from inflation).

Previous Kennedy homes have gone on the market for less exuberant sums. Curbed noted
 that the Kennedy home in Virginia, built not long before JFK was assassinated,
went on the market in October for $11million. It remains on the market today at the reduced price of $7.95million.

Unlike the Florida home, the Kennedys only slept in the Virginia home for two weekends before the president was assassinated.

The compound did not weather time well and was considered a tear-down property by many in the area but was purchased and given a $6 million renovation by investment bank CEO John K. Castle
