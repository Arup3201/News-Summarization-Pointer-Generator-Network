LIVERPOOL AND BALOTELLI HOPING FOR CUP COMFORT

Their inconsistent form has probably already put paid to a repeat of last season's Premier League challenge, so Liverpool may well target one of the Cups.

After their marathon penalty shoot-out success against Middlesbrough in round three, they now face Swansea City at Anfield on Tuesday night.

With changes expected to be made, it remains to be seen if the misfiring Mario Balotelli - who still has just the one goal since his arrival - is given another chance to prove himself.

The Reds have already suffered five defeats this season and though the Capital One Cup is last on their list of priorities, another one here will be sorely felt.

Misfiring Mario Balotelli will be hoping to retain his place and find some form for Liverpool against Swansea

SWANSEA HOPING FOR REPEAT PERFORMANCE

Swansea won 3-1 at Anfield at this same stage in 2012 en route to lifting the League Cup, the first major piece of silverware in the club's history.

Garry Monk's side have started the Premier League season well - currently sitting sixth - and they will hope this form translates to the Cup.

They've already dumped out one Merseyside opponent already, beating Everton 3-0 in the last round.

Having been part of that 2013-winning team, Monk will fancy another long Cup run and is expected to resist wholesale changes to his line-up, though Wayne Routledge and Gylfi Sigurdsson will be rested.

Monk is, of course, going head-to-head with a former manager at Swansea in Brendan Rodgers.

SHREWSBURY'S BIG NIGHT

This was the fixture that jumped out from the fourth round draw - a real David vs Goliath tie in the best of Cup tradition.

A staggering 72 places separate Premier League leaders Chelsea and their League Two opponents Shrewsbury but a sell-out crowd at the Greenhous Meadow will be cheering on the underdogs.

The Shrews have already dumped Blackpool, Leicester City and Norwich City out of the competition and their manager Micky Mellon believes anything can happen.

'We aren't here to clap people on to the pitch,' he said. 'We going to try and knock them out. We know the task is massive but we want to reach the quarter-finals.'

While Chelsea's squad cost £307m to assemble, the Shrews' side was put together on a shoestring. But knockout football can be a great leveller.

SHOWCASE FOR CHELSEA'S KIDS

Chelsea have one of the best academies in the country and are the current holders of the U21 Premier League and FA Youth Cup.

And some of their emerging talents are likely to feature at Shrewsbury on Tuesday, including Lewis Baker, Nathan Ake, Dominic Solanke and Jeremie Boga.

Dutch defender Ake has already tasted first-team football and started in the last round against Bolton.

England Under 20 international Baker has made just one first-team appearance but is hotly tipped to become a star for club and country.

Solanke is also highly-regarded by Mourinho and came on last week in the Champions League match with Maribor. He helped England win the Under 17 European Championships in the summer.

French playmaker Boga, 17, is a regular starter in the Under 21 Premier League and the UEFA Youth League.

Dominic Solanke featured in Chelsea's Champions League win over Maribor last week

BOURNEMOUTH HOPING TO CONTINUE SCORING SPREE

Nobody will fancy taking on the in-form Cherries at the moment, especially after their 8-0 rout of Birmingham at the weekend.

Eddie Howe's team sit fourth in the Championship and they have won their last four matches, so this will be a real test for Alan Irvine's West Brom.

It is 51 years since Bournemouth last made it to the fourth round and this is the furthest they've ever progressed, so history could be made on Tuesday night.

'They are really nice milestones because you don't set out to achieve things like that... hopefully someone will be talking in 50 years' time about this team,' said Howe.

Irvine must decide whether to rest players ahead of the weekend trip to Leicester but that could prove a dangerous strategy.

LEAGUE ONE DUO HOPING TO MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES

As Bradford City proved when they reached the final in 2013, lower league clubs can progress in this competition.

So though the meeting of League One sides MK Dons and Sheffield United is not the most glamorous tie of the round, both will see it as an opportunity.

The Dons created a seismic shock when they thrashed Manchester United 4-0 in the second round and are into the fourth round for the first time in their history.

The Blades, who profited from an unexpected run to the semi-finals of last season's FA Cup, enter the contest in good form, having won their last three matches.

ANOTHER CHANCE FOR KIT SYMONS TO STAKE HIS CLAIM

When these two sides met back in August, Derby thrashed sorry-looking Fulham 5-1. Fast forward two months and the London side are a very different proposition.

Caretaker boss Kit Symons has galvanised the Cottagers since he took over from Felix Magath and has won five of his eight matches in temporary charge.

A win against Derby on Tuesday night and a place in the last eight of the Cup will further boost his chances.

Steve McClaren's team are currently top of the Championship but produced their worst performance for some time in losing at home to Wigan at the weekend.

Still, they will head to Craven Cottage as the favourites.

Kit Symons has another opportunity to stake his claim for the Fulham job on a full-time basis against Derby

SAINTS HOPING KOEMAN RENAISSANCE CONTINUES

After that exodus of talent in the summer, few expected to see Southampton second in the Premier League table at the start of November.

Ronald Koeman reinvested the transfer cash shrewdly and with the likes of Graziano Pelle, Sadio Mane and Dusan Tadic impressing, they are flying high.

Having beaten Stoke 1-0 at St Mary's on Saturday, they face a quick re-match at the Britannia on Wednesday night.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes lifted the League Cup with three different clubs - Manchester United, Chelsea and Blackburn - and back-to-back home wins over Swansea and Newcastle suggest their fortunes are improving.

NASRI SET FOR MAN CITY RETURN AGAINST NEWCASTLE

After losing further ground in the title race at West Ham on Saturday, Manchester City will be seeking a return to winning ways when they play Newcastle at the Etihad on Wednesday night.

With a derby against United looming on Sunday, Manuel Pellegrini is expected to make changes and Samir Nasri could return after a month out following groin surgery.

City lifted the League Cup last season and regard the competition as worthwhile. They will start as clear favourites against Newcastle.

Sunday's win at Tottenham lifted some of the pressure on manager Alan Pardew but he'll admit the Cup plays second fiddle to trying to avoid a relegation struggle this season.

BRIGHTON SEEKING TO PILE MORE MISERY ON SPURS

Tottenham were heavily criticised after throwing away the lead to lose at home to Newcastle United on Sunday and recent results have shown they are far from top four material.

The Cup should offer some comfort to Mauricio Pochettino and his under-performing team but they'll have to be on their guard against Brighton on Wednesday night.

Pochettino is likely to rotate his squad for the visit of Sami Hyypia's men, who currently sit one place outside the relegation zone after a very disappointing start to the season.

Having said that, Brighton have gone 10 league matches without a win and so Spurs will start as clear favourites.

Mauricio Pochettino desperately needs an improved performance from his Spurs side against Brighton
