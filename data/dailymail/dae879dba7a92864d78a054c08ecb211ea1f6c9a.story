Another scandal: Dominique Strauss-Kahn has found himself caught up in an investigation into an alleged underage prostitution racket

Only 24 hours after escaping  sexual assault charges in France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been implicated in an investigation into underage prostitution.

The former head of the International Monetary Fund is among politicians and business leaders allegedly named in a ‘black book’ of clients at a luxury hotel which was said to double as a brothel.

A judicial Inquiry into prostitution at Carlton Hotel, in Lille, was opened in March amid claims underage girls were involved.

Prostitution is legal in France, but those offering sex must be over 18.

Senior staff from the Carlton Hotel, including the manager and a public relations executive, were arrested earlier this month as part of the inquiry.

They are said to have acted as ‘pimps’ to their guests, and face charges of procuring prostitutes, organised conspiracy in criminal acts and money laundering.

French Closer magazine, which published the claims yesterday, said it has seen prosecution documents which say Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, used prostitutes at the hotel.

French Closer claims: 'The prostitutes 
and the go-betweens charging for sex indeed put forward the name of the 
husband of Anne Sinclair.

'According to one of the girls in the ring, Dominique Strauss-Kahn would have benefitted from her services.'

French Closer magazine, which has a good record for investigative journalism, claimed it has 100 per cent confirmation from Lille examining judges Ausbart and Vignau that Strauss-Kahn was a client of those accused.

He would, naturally, face criminal proceedings if he was found to have paid or slept with an underage girl.

Sexual assault: French journalist and writer Tristane Banon attends a rally in solidarity with rape victims in Paris

Lille is just an hour from Paris by high-speed train, and an obvious place for high-profile men to travel to meet prostitutes.

Despite conceding that he had attacked author Tristane Banon, judges cleared Mr Strauss-Kahn on Thursday because of the statute of limitations in France, which is three years for sexual assault.

It is the second time in three months the former IMF chief has been cleared of sex charges. In August, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges that he had raped a maid in a New York hotel room in May.

Ms Banon first spoke out after Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of attempting to rape a maid at at the Sofitel Hotel in New York.

U.S. prosecutors eventually dropped the charges after finding the cleaner, 32-year-old Nafissatou Diallo, had told a number of lies.

Mr Strauss-Kahn could have received a prison sentence of up to 15 years if found guilty of attempted rape in France.

He still faces civil cases in both Paris and New York over the alleged rape incidents.
