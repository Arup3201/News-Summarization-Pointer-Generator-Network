Controversial: The front page of the Sun in 2005 which featured the image of the humiliated fallen dictator Saddam Hussein

Rupert Murdoch’s media company News Corp could be investigated over claims it obtained photos of Saddam Hussein wearing his underpants in an Iraq jail by bribing a US official, it was alleged today.

Former US president George W Bush ordered an investigation into how the Sun and New York Post newspapers obtained the photos, published in May 2005, but never found the source of the leak.

The Sun’s former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time his newspaper paid ‘more than £500’ for the photos, but the Daily Beast had now claimed the ‘payment was significantly greater’.

Mr Dudman 
said at the time that US military sources handed over the photos to deal
‘a body blow to the resistance in Iraq’ and that the picture was 
obtained by ‘professional journalistic methods’.

It
has now also been alleged by the Daily Beast - the online home of 
Newsweek magazine - that the money was handed over on US soil. The Daily
Telegraph has claimed a Sun photographer was sent to California to buy 
the pictures.

Probe coming? Rupert Murdoch’s (right) media firm News Corp could be investigated over claims it obtained photos of the late Saddam Hussein (left) wearing only his underpants in an Iraq jail by bribing a US official

Comment: The Sun's former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time his newspaper paid 'more than £500' for the photos, but the Daily Beast had now claimed the 'payment was significantly greater'

US
military officials believe the photos were taken at the Camp Cropper 
prison near Baghdad at a time from January to April 2004, before Hussein
was due to be tried for crimes against humanity.

News
Corp reacted angrily to the new allegations of bribery put forward by
the Daily Beast, claiming it was ‘just a lame attempt to regurgitate old
news’ and ‘all of this was widely reported on in 2005’.

A spokesman for the holding company 
added: ‘We didn’t believe then, and certainly don’t believe now, that it
was wrong to acquire and publish newsworthy photographs of a notorious 
war criminal.’

News Corp spokesman

More than 50 people have been arrested by the Metropolian Police as they investigate alleged payments to public officials in Operation Elveden, but detectives involved with the inquiry are not thought to be probing the Hussein photo.

One of those arrested in the probe was Mr Dudman - although he has not been charged with any criminal offence in Britain.

Operation Elveden - the investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials and other information leaks - is being run alongside two other operations looking at allegations of phone hacking and accusations of computer hacking.

News Corp is already being probed in the US by the FBI and other American agencies over whether it committed any crimes under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing public officials in Britain.

The Act means US-owned companies which are proven to have bribed public officials can be fined and senior executives sent to jail. Hussein was executed 18 months after the pictures were published.
