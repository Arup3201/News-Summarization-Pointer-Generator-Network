Health officials have told supermarkets not to put displays of daffodils near fruit or vegetables- in case they poison shoppers.

Shops were asked to relocate the spring flowers as they contain a toxic chemical which can cause stomach upset, nausea, and in severe cases can even require hospital treatment.

In a letter to all major retailers, Public Health England  warned that large numbers of foreign customers, whose first language was not English, were at risk of confusing the plants for vegetables.

Supermarkets have been told not to put displays of spring daffodils at the front of stores - in case they poison shoppers

It mentioned a case where a family who became ill and needed hospital treatment after they bought and ate the plant believing it was something else. 

The most common error is mistaking daffodil bulbs for onions but the flowers risk being mistaken for vegetables popular in China or even spring onions, could mistake them for other vegetables, according to The Grocer magazine.

Despite their innocent appearance, all parts of the daffodil are potentially poisonous if eaten.

The most common cause of poisoning come from mistaking daffodil bulbs for onions.

The stems and leaves are also sometimes wrongly taken for a type of vegetable popular in Chinese cooking and often used to make dumplings. If eaten, they can cause severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

Although the effects are very unpleasant, most poisoning victims recover fully without treatment.

however, just a small amount of the bulb is enough to kill a dog, while munching on the leaves and flowers will make them very ill. The Blue Cross advises dog owners to not keep daffodils in their gardens.  

Daffodil-related poisonings are surprisingly common in Britain, becoming one of the most frequent causes of accidental poisonings. 

Public Health England said that its National Poisons Information Service was contacted 27 times last year for advice by medics who were treating poisoning cases linked to daffodils and narcissi last year.

It said that over the past six years 63 patients suffered symptoms from poisoning.  

Professor Paul Cosford, medical director at Public Health England, warned in the letter: 'Daffodils are dangerous if eaten and poisoning can occur as a result.

'We are aware of an incident in Bristol a few years ago in which some shoppers, for whom English was not their first language, bought daffodils and cooked the plants believing them to be something else. 

'Several required hospital treatment.'
