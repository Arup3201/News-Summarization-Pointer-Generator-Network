Veterans of the D-Day landings will receive public funding to make the annual pilgrimage to the Normandy beaches where they fought for our freedom, George Osborne will announce today.

The Chancellor has set aside money raised from fines on the big banks to ensure that veterans can continue making the trip to France each year for as long as their health allows.

Treasury sources said Mr Osborne had been moved to act by the scenes in Normandy earlier this month when around 650 veterans gathered with world leaders to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.

Mr Osborne, whose grandfather won the Military Cross in the First World War, told the Daily Mail: ‘These amazing people are an example to the world. Hearing their stories last weekend about what they went through and the comrades they lost was truly humbling.

‘It is only right that they should be able to travel back to Normandy every year and I am delighted that we can make it happen.

‘It is fitting that the money paid in fines by people who have demonstrated the worst kind of values is being used to help and support those who without doubt have demonstrated the very best.’

Last night George Batts, secretary of the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘It is a bloody marvellous gesture and there will be a lot that take it up.’

Mr Batts, who cleared mines from Gold Beach on D-Day as an 18-year-old Royal Engineer, added: ‘We are closing the national association later this year as people get older, but a lot of the branches are still active and a lot of us still want to go.

‘I hope to still be going when I’m 110. It has got a bit expensive to go back and this will help enormously – I hope the banks commit a few more misdeeds!’

Over the years veterans have received lottery cash to help make the annual pilgrimage to Normandy, but this source of funding is due to end next year.

Under the new scheme, funding will be provided to allow every veteran who wants to make the trip to France to do so.

Cash will also be available for carers to help those who are too frail to travel alone. It will cover both transport and accommodation. A Treasury source said there was ‘no cap’ on the number of veterans who could take up the offer. It will operate indefinitely.

The money will come from hundreds of millions of pounds in fines levied on banks involved in the Libor scandal, where they colluded to fix the interest rate at which they lent money to each other.

Mr Osborne changed the law in 2012 to allow the cash to go to good causes associated with the military and emergency services.

Tens of millions of pounds has already been paid out to groups including military charities, search and rescue groups, air ambulances and the Imperial War Museum.  A spokesman for The Royal British Legion, which will operate the new scheme on behalf of the Treasury, said: ‘We’re excited to play a role in such an important part of the remembrance experience for our veterans and pleased the Treasury has extended this funding.’

‘It is fitting that the money paid in 
fines by people who have demonstrated the worst kind of values is being 
used to help and support those who without doubt have demonstrated the 
very best.’

Last night the initiative was welcomed by Bernard Jordan, the D-Day veteran whose ‘Great Escape’ to the 70th anniversary commemoration enchanted the nation.

Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday today, he said: ‘That’s great. That sounds like a good idea.’  After failing to get on an official trip, Mr Jordan walked out of his care home, boarded a train and then caught a ferry to Normandy so he could take part in the 70th anniversary commemoration.

But when he disappeared from The Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex, staff became worried about him and contacted police. By the time he returned safely to Britain he was front page news.

Mr Jordan witnessed the heroism and the horrors of D-Day on  June 6, 1944 from his ship the Endeavour, where he was serving as an electrical engineer, supplying tanks to the British troops invading northern France.

Other D-Day veterans also welcomed the news that the Treasury would pay for them to return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades.

Former Royal Marine Bill Bryant, 89, from Exeter, Devon, said he thought it was a ‘great idea’.

Mr Bryant, who was 19 when he landed on Gold Beach, added: ‘I have just returned from Normandy and it was a very emotional trip. I cried a lot. But I am so glad that I went. It will stay with me forever.

‘I was very lucky in that the Royal Marines paid for my trip, but I know a lot of the other vets had to foot the bill themselves and it can be very expensive, especially when you’re on a pension like we all are.

‘What a great thing for the Government to do – shame they didn’t do it in time for the 70th anniversary though.’

D-Day veteran Cyril Ager, a former sapper with the Royal Engineers who landed on Gold Beach, said the scheme was ‘wonderful news’.

Mr Ager, 90, from Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, paid for his trip to France for the anniversary, and it cost more than £1,000.

He said that although it was ‘emotional to return’ it was a great honour to do so.

‘It would be a huge help to have the trip paid for as I had such a good experience going back there,’ added Mr Ager.
