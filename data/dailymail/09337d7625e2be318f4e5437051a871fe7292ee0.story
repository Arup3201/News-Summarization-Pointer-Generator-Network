It could be the end of the keyboard - but also the pen.

German researchers have revealed a hi-tech glove that lets people simply write in mid air.

Dubbed the 'airwriter', the system is able to work out what is being written simply by monitoring the position of the user's hand.

The airwriting glove can recognise letters drawn in mid air using sensors. Its inventor claims it could one day even be woven into clothing so people can type anywhere

The system could be combined with Google Glass to let owners of the wearable computer type in mid air - and the project recently won funding from the search giant

Acceleration sensors and gyroscopes are attached to the thin glove, and track the movement of the user's hand.

During writing, the airwriting system 
decodes the letters by a pattern recognition method.

For every letter of 
the alphabet, a statistical model of the characteristic signal pattern 
is stored - this allows the system to spot letters and build up words easily, and learn a user's writing style over time.

Its inventors say it could be used to enter text messages and write emails.

'The airwriting glove is used to write letters into air, as if using an invisible board or pad,' said doctoral student Christoph Amma, who developed the system at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.

She believes the technology could eventually be woven into clothing so it can be used anywhere.

'The interaction is embedded seamlessly in everyday life,' she said.

Sensors attached to a glove record hand 
movements, then a computer system captures relevant signals and 
translates them into text.

The sensors are also able to tell when a user is actually writing, rather than simply moving around normally.

'All movements that are not similar to writing, such as cooking, doing laundry, waving to someone, are ignored.

'The system runs in the background without interpreting every movement as computer input,' says Amma.

The system can recognise complete sentences written in capital letters and presently has a vocabulary of 8,000 words.

'The system has an error rate of 11 per cent,
but when it is adapted to the individual writing style of the user, the
error rate drops to three per cent,' Christoph Amma says.

To
help develop the idea, Amma received the 'Google Faculty Research 
Award', worth $81,000, raising hopes it could be used with Google's 
Glass wearer.

The prototype glove is packed with sensors. However, it is believed future versions could be small enough to be simply woven into clothing

'When such a system is combined with the
possibility to input commands and texts by gestures, you do not even 
need a hand-held device,' she said.

Scientists are now working on further refining the method to filter out writing, and making the system smaller.

'This can be achieved with commercial components. An unobtrusive wrist band might be feasible, for example,' says Amma.
