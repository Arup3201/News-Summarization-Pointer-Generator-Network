Guilty: Jerimiah Hartline has admitted assault after causing a seven-car pile-up on the freeway

A man who stole a truck and crashed it on a busy freeway while apparently fleeing from 'zombies' has pleaded guilty to assault, theft and hit and run.

Jerimiah Hartline injured seven people in the six-car pile-up last month, and blamed the accident on supernatural forces.

But yesterday he admitted stealing the vehicle full of strawberries and causing the accident in Temecula, California.

The homeless 19-year-old from Tennessee was travelling as a passenger in the three-axle truck as it was delivering fruit to San Diego on April 6.

When the driver, Daniel Martinez, stopped to make adjustments to the vehicle, Hartline jumped into the driving seat and headed off on the I-15.

He quickly started driving erratically and weaving around the road, until the 18-wheeler slammed into a car, causing a crash involving five other vehicles.

Two people had to be taken to hospital with serious injuries, while another five had minor injuries.

The truck's load of strawberries spilled all over the road, causing the closure of the freeway for seven hours.

Hartline tried to flee the scene by stealing a white van which had stopped nearby, but was detained by the driver until police came to arrest him.

Horde: Hartline claimed he was being pursued by zombies and was trying to shake them off his tail

After his arrest, the criminal told police he was trying to escape a horde of pursuing zombies.

'Hartline thought that zombies were chasing him and clinging to the truck,' a police spokesman said at the time. 'Hartline swerved the truck side to side to shake the zombies off.'

Officers also said that the driver was in an 'altered' state and may have taken narcotics of some kind.

Yesterday he pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, hit and run causing death or injury, and vehicle theft, according to U-T San Diego.

Four other charges were dropped, while the sentence he faces has been reduced from 12 years to five years as part of a plea deal.
