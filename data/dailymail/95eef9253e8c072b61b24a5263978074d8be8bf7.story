It's not your conventional 'Welcome home' banner.

One unfaithful soldier's wife shared the news and shamed her husband by stringing up a sign over the front door of the home they shared.

The sign read 'Welcome Home Cheater' and was spotted by a Reddit user in Washington State.

Welcome home: Or pehaps not? This photo was taken by a Reddit user in Washington State

As is so often the case with signs such as this posted online, it's not always possible to know the full story however it's believed the picture was taken in the town of Bremerton, near Seattle.

The town is home to a military hospital and a Navy shipyard located on Puget Sound. In recent weeks, a number of military personnel have returned home from active duty.

The picture came from Reddit user Farthoven who had it sent to them after being shown the image at a coffee shop.

How it should be: A more typical homecoming for returning soldiers

'This was taken by a woman who showed it to a barista at a coffee place who sent it to me. Iâ€™m 3rd party here. Just the first lucky redditor to come across it.'

One random user had a unique take on the Reddit thread: 'In other news, Daniel B Cheater returned home today from Afghanistan to a warm reception from friends and family.'
