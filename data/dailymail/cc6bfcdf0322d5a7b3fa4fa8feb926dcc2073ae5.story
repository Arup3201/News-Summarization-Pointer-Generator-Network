Hacking their way through an eerie twinkling landscape of cascading ice, these climbers dangled over some of the remotest landscapes in the world.

The glacial scenes in Iceland have been sculpted over the years by fierce winds and captured in these beautiful images during an expedition by British and American adventurers.

Photographer Keith Ladzinski, 37, from Colorado, travelled with 38-year-old Dawn Glanc from Ohio and British Tim Emmett, 40, as the trio were dwarfed by the huge structures with roofs as large as 15ft across.

Dwarfed: Dawn Glanc, one of three ice climbers from Britain and the U.S., leads the way in a precipitous climb of the Northern Fjords, a wall of frozen water, in Iceland

Tim Emmett, pictured, said: 'The wind in Iceland is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere I have seen before. Huge mushroom and cauliflower-like features are sometimes so vast they form horizontal roofs 15ft across, like an ice umbrella. The only way past them was to carve a hole or teeter around hoping it didn't collapse'

Frozen in time: A mixture of volcanic ash and cascades of ice, the eerily blue landscapes are so vast that they are difficult to comprehend - or even depict on camera

Precipitous: Dangling over the void, British climber Tim Emmett lowers himself slowly down the side of an Icelandic fjord in a sport which can claim climbers' lives

Mr Emmett said: 'The wind in Iceland is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere I have seen before.

'Huge mushroom and cauliflower-like features sometimes so vast they form horizontal roofs 15ft across, like an ice umbrella.

'The only way past them was to carve a hole through or teeter around hoping it didn't collapse.

'It was a hidden playground for frozen enthusiasts, patterned with a network of ice capillaries waiting to be climbed.'

After scaling the walls of a fjord in February last year, the team headed south-east to the five mile long Sslheimajvkull glacier and dangled from its side using their ice axes.

Mr Emmett added: 'We drove across the south coast past lava fields and looming cliffs. Venturing into the mist-filled darkness, I felt like we were driving across the moon.'

Flowing: While some of the landscapes are spiky and jagged, others, like the Solheimajokull glacier pictured, look almost like they have been held in a liquid state

Huge: The glacier is five miles long, not far from the Atlantic ocean and popular with the tourists who visit Iceland to see the loneliest reaches of the planet

Touching the void: As Tim Emmett edges his way along a wall of ice using an axe, chilly waters flow beneath him reflecting back the strange blue glow

Nation of ice: Glaciers cover around 11 per cent of the entire surface area of Iceland, with ice caps up to a kilometre thick in the most mountainous areas

Precious landscape: Iceland is still mostly untouched by man, though its largest ice cap, Vatnajokull, shrank in size by around 5 per cent between 1958 and 2000

The formation of the 250-metre thick glacier, five miles from the Atlantic Ocean, provided a new test for the adventurers. High winds in the region have carved huge chasms out of the ice, allowing the climbers to venture underneath it.

He added: 'Climbing on this transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre - like no other ice climbing I had ever done.'

No matter how many precautions the group take, ice climing can be a dangerous business. In February a German tourist in his 50s died after falling into an ice cave on Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, despite venturing there with a guide.

Up to 40 rescuers had to wade in dangerously cold waters up to their waists to retrieve the man, but he was later pronounced dead.

Hacking his way through: Tim Emmett works to conquer the ice. He said: 'This transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre, like no other ice climbing I had done'
