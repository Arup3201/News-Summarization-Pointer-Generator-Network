Two men were today convicted of helping serial killer Joanna Dennehy, who stabbed three men in the heart before dumping their bodies in ditches.

Gary Stretch was found guilty of three counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body and one of attempted murder at Cambridge Crown Court.

Leslie Layton was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice.

The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found in March and April last year.

After
the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected 
two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random, the court has 
heard.

She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived.

During the trial, prosecutors said Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her victims as she killed 'for fun'.

Dennehy was likened to 'Uma Thurman 
from Kill Bill and the woman from the Terminator' by married 
father-of-two Mr Lee shortly before his death.

Mr Chapman had dubbed her the 'man woman' because of her intimidating nature.

At
 the height of a nationwide man-hunt, she bragged to one witness that 
she had killed eight people - although no further murders have been 
detected.

All of the murder victims died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the heart.

After his death at a house in Peterborough, on or around March 19, the body of Mr Slaboszewski, 31, was stored in a wheelie bin.

At one point a smirking Dennehy showed the body to a teenage girl, prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the court.

Along with John Chapman, 56, who was 
killed in the block of bedsits he shared with Dennehy in Bifield on 
March 29, his body was later dumped in a ditch near the isolated Thorney
 Dyke.

Mr Lee, 48, was also killed on March 29 in the same house as Mr Slaboszewski.

His
 body was found wearing a black sequin dress and positioned in a sexual 
pose in a separate ditch near Newborough, in what Mr Wright described as
 a 'final act of humiliation'.

After the Peterborough killings, 
Dennehy had bragged that she and Stretch were 'like Bonnie and Clyde' as
 they drove 140 miles across the country to search out further victims.

Describing the involvement of the two defendants, Mr Wright said both had been 'willing and able' participants in the plot.

Neither man gave evidence in the trial, but both claimed they had been acting under duress.

Stretch was convicted of the attempted murder of Mr Rogers, but the jury is still considering the charge that he tried to kill Mr Bereza.

Two counts of preventing a lawful burial against Layton are also still being considered by the jury.

Dennehy, from Peterborough, has already pleaded guilty to murder as well as preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three victims and two charges of attempted murder.

She is currently awaiting sentencing along with Robert Moore, 55, who has admitted assisting an offender.
