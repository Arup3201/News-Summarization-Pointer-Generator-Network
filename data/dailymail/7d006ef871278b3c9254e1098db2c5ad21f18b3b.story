It must rank as one of the  most quintessentially English of scenes.

Punts
glide serenely on the  water during the last sunny days of autumn… a 
family picnics on a grassy bank… ducks paddle silently by.

But 
then the peace is shattered by a swan named Asboy – and no duck, boater 
or passer-by is safe as he continues his father’s mission to terrorise 
the waterways of Cambridge.

Unless, that is, you happen to be one
ton of prime British bullock.

Confrontation: The violent swan known as 'Asboy' came face to face with a bullock yesterday

Loser: Asboy was forced to back down by his much bigger rival on the tow path

The River Cam’s most vicious swan met its
match in one particular opponent who apparently decided enough was 
enough.

With all the confidence gained from months of scaring off 
intruders on its city centre territory, the cocky cob had squared up to 
the bullock which had been grazing quietly nearby.

Seconds later, however, the swan was forced to retreat when the beast drove him back into the water.

The scene was a rare defeat for Asboy, son of another swan that famously ruled the roost on the Cam.

Mr
Asbo, as his dad was nicknamed, spent most of his life chasing 
canoeists and boaters and biting intruders before conservationists 
relocated him 60 miles away and clipped his wings to stop him returning.

Escape: The swan proceeded to hop back into the river, watched by the large bullock

Victory: The encounter was a rare defeat for Asboy, who has developed a fearsome reputation on the Cam

That was nearly 18 months ago.

Then, last summer, Son of Asbo stepped 
in to carry on the family tradition.

The chip off the old block 
also turned his anger on fellow swans.

This weekend, horrified tourists 
saw Asboy ferociously grab a passing swan by the neck with his beak, 
hold it under water for 15 seconds – then sit on it to stop it wriggling
free.

The hapless victim escaped the attack only when its partner came 
to the rescue.

‘I have never seen such a vicious swan,’ said 
nearby resident Thomas Ellis, 52.

‘He appears to be even worse than his 
dad. I’ve seen him swimming up and down the river close to the punts and
he has even attacked a few punting poles.

Earlier: Asboy was seen suddenly attacking another swan and biting it in the neck

Vicious: Asboy is the son of 'Mr Asbo', who has been moved after terrorising rowers and tourists

‘People fear he will be a repeat of his dad and some are now too frightened to go out on the water when he’s around.’

The
bullock versus swan encounter happened when Asboy left the water to 
challenge the grazing creature. Unperturbed, the bullock simply advanced
to push the swan back down the bank.

‘I don’t think the swan 
was  ever going to win that particular fight,’ said a riverbank 
spectator.

‘The bullock really put him in his  place – but I got the 
feeling it was a tactical withdrawal.

'I’m sure Asboy will live to fight
another day. I don’t think we’ve seen the last of that particular swan.'

Brutal: Tourists in Cambridge screamed in horror when they witnessed the two birds fighting

Reputation: Asboy is fast developing a reputation for being just as vicious as his notorious father
