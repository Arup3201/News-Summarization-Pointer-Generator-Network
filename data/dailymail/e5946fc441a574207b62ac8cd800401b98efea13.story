The terrifying moment two skydivers almost collided thousands of feet above ground has been captured on film.

The pair were falling at up to 240mph when they missed each other by centimetres.

Both skydivers were freeflying and had not yet pulled their parachute, meaning a collision would almost certainly have been fatal if either had been knocked unconscious.

Kenneth Andre Adolfsen, whose feet are visible, missing colliding with his friend in mid-air by centimetres

Kenneth Andre Adolfsen admitted that he and his friend were 'very lucky' to avoid each other in mid-air.

The close call was captured by Mr Adolfsen's helmet camera as he jumped from the plane.

The Norwegian dare-devil immediately begins a head-down skydive but within seconds his friend can be seen hurtling straight towards him.

With minimal control, the quick-thinking skydiver manages to curl up just as his friend plummets past.

Mr Adolfsen lifts his knees up and his friend also pulls his limbs into his body as they narrowly avoid colliding.

He said on his YouTube page: 'Thing happens very fast in freeflying, and we were lucky this time.

'Safety first, know your limits.'

Freeflying is a more extreme version of 
skydiving and participants travel at up to double the speeds of a normal
'belly-to-earth' fall.

The pair only avoid missing one another by curling up their legs and arms

The speed of the fall means jumpers have to be extra careful to avoid collisions with other skydivers, who will be travelling slower.

It is not clear where their dive took place.

In December, a skydiver in his 30s died after colliding with another parachutist above Sydney.

He was knocked unconscious and landed outside the designated zone, according to police.

In 2011, Patrick Sandeman died following a jump at Sibson Aerodrome, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he collided with skydiver Matt Le Berre.

Mr Le Berre pulled on his brakes when he realised Mr Sandeman was below him but could not stop his knees hitting his friend's canopy and their parachute lines became tangled.
