If things don’t go well for England at Lord's and they lose this Test match there can be no excuses. Everything they asked for beforehand, they got.

They got the pitch they craved and won the toss but they find themselves in the predicament they are in this morning because they bowled poorly on the first day and failed to take advantage of conditions which were stacked in their favour.

Some people have talked about the toss but England captain Alastair Cook had absolutely no choice but to bowl first on that. I don’t care what anyone says. They just didn’t bowl well enough.

England have little chance of winning unless they completely change the mindset they showed when they batted on Sunday.

Sometimes
 you have to look at what went before you and the way the opposition had
 success and adapt accordingly. This just isn’t the pitch to ‘guts it 
out’ because there is always a ball with your name on it. Look at the 
way Kumar and Jadeja played with almost a one-day mindset. There was 
nothing reckless but they were positive and took the game to England.

On
 the other hand,  England hit a wall when they got to 70-odd for one. 
They just didn’t go anywhere and it concerns me that there is no-one in 
that top three who is going to take the initiative. Cook, Gary Ballance 
and Sam Robson are similar players and nobody seems able to get 
busy and go after attacks..

That’s understandable for Cook. He wanted 
to guts it out but I’m afraid cricket is about scoring runs and not just
 occupying the crease. David Gower used to say to me — when I was out of
 nick and would occasionally bend his ear — that it just takes a couple 
of  boundaries to get yourself back in nick. Keith Fletcher used to say 
the same.

But even more important is the mindset. You can’t just 
look to leave, leave, leave. There were some good signs but because 
no-one is going at the other end there is no-one to relieve the pressure
 on Cook. That allows Dhoni just to sit in with his seamers.

High expectations: England failed to impress home crowd at a packed Lord's on day four of the second test

There 
is no doubt there is still mental baggage from last winter in Australia 
for those senior players. This side, the senior guys, were used to 
winning and being national heroes. Losing wears you down. You have only 
to look at who is doing well in this side and it is the young players 
who have come in, such as  Ballance and Joe Root.

But there is no 
let-up in Test cricket. They can’t go back to county cricket and score 
runs like players used to be able to. These players must fix this 
themselves. Someone has to play that Jadeja role if England are going to
 have any chance whatsoever. Whether it’s Stuart Broad, Ben 
Stokes, Matt Prior, whoever. Someone has to take the attack to India. 
Otherwise there is only one outcome, I’m afraid.
