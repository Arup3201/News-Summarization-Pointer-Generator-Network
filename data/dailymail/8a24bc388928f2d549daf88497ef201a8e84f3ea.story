Ministers could take charge of one of Britain’s biggest social services departments after failing to protect children.

Birmingham City Council has been repeatedly condemned as ‘inadequate’ by inspectors, and its children’s services will be taken over by the government if it fails to improve.

The move, which follows several high-profile deaths of children in the city, including Khyra Ishaq and Keanu Williams, was backed by Collette Elliot, who sued the council for failing to protect her from her abusive prostitute mother when she was a child.

Birmingham City Council's care of children has been branded 'inadequate' for years, and was heavily criticised over the death of Khyra Ishaq who died aged seven, after being starved by her mother

Oftsed inspectors will be sent into Birmingham’s children services later this month, and if they find no improvements Education Secretary Michael Gove will send in officials from Whitehall.

The Department for Education said: 'We have warned Birmingham that unless Ofsted identify signs of improvement in their next inspection, we will take further action.'

In a speech this week Mr Gove admitted that to date the government had ‘not yet intervened vigorously enough’ to protect the most vulnerable children.

He said: ‘We have not intervened to rescue those children who have been suffering the most in our society.

‘My time in politics so far has been punctuated by moments when all of us have been left speechless - because a child’s cries were never heard.’ They included Khyra Ishaq and Keanu Williams, he said.

Two-year-old Keanu was murdered by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth  in 2011, after social services allowed unqualified workers and students to conduct key reviews into his safety.

A serious case review into his death found authorities failed at ‘fundamental levels of care’, missing ‘horrifying’ cruelty.

Khyra died in May 2008 after being starved to death by her mother and stepfather. Birmingham City Council was told of her plight four months before she died.

Khyra and her five siblings were all starved as well as being subjected to a harrowing punishment regime and a five-month detention, involving beatings with a cane.

In 2010 the children's services department was served with an improvement notice by the Government in September 2010 after a serious of high-profile child deaths, including the Khyra’s death.

Peter Hay, head of the children’s services department, admitted there had been problems in the past but urged ministers to ensure the council remained in involved in its running.

‘I think there's got to be a role for the city council - because it can bring the relationships and the money and the investment," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

‘But it can't do what it's always done and I absolutely respect that the Secretary of State has a very difficult decision because there are no easy answers here.’

Last month Birmingham was branded a 'national disgrace' by Ofsted's chief inspector, who said the city is one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world.

Sir Michael Wilshaw highlighted the infant mortality rate in Britain’s second city, which is higher than Cuba's and almost twice the national average.

He singled Birmingham out in a scathing report that found 20 areas in England where councils do not have ‘the most basic acceptable practice in place’.

Sir Michael blamed Birmingham, where a third of children live in poverty, for ‘failure of corporate governance on a grand scale’.

Collette Elliot, 36, who sued Birmingham council over abuse by her prostitute mother, backed ministers taking control

A woman who sued Birmingham City 
Council for failing to stop her mother abusing her backed the idea of 
the government seizing control of social services.

Collette
Elliot, 36, said she wanted ministers to ‘see for themselves what’s 
going on’ and uncover who is to blame for the culture of failure.

Last year she sued Birmingham Social Services claiming social workers repeatedly overlooked  warnings about her mother’s abuse.

It came after she unearthed social worker records which showed staff had serious concerns about her mother.

Collette said her mother would have sex with men while she slept in the same bed.

Collette, who is now married with four children, was also sexually abused on many occasions by her mother’s clients.

Her mother, Maureen Batchelor, died last August of cancer at the age of 60.

Collete said: ‘I’m so glad that the Government are planning to take over the children’s services in Birmingham.

‘It is a chance for them to see for themselves what’s going on, in my opinion there is too many cover ups.

‘The social workers are saying there is no one to blame well there is, it is them, and the Government will now see this.

‘It
is such a good idea they’re taking over and as I am campaigning for the
laws to be changed, hopefully this will happen faster once they see 
what is really going on.

‘I 
was abused since the 70s, which is when social services started to fail 
me, and now we are in 2013 and nothing has been changed, it needs to 
stop.’

Collette, who still 
lives in Birmingham where she was brought up as a child, said: ‘My 
mother left me with mental health issues and ruined my childhood.

‘She
abused me, she found it funny to make me eat my dinner with a pot of 
ketchup dripping from my head and would have killed me after holding a 
knife to my throat if a neighbour didn’t pull her off.

‘I
really can’t remember how early it started but I was in and out of care
all the time and remember being swung around rooms by my hair.

‘I
never knew my dad, he was one of my mother’s clients, she didn’t even 
know him apparently, and I grew up with my mum and step-dad.

‘I
turned into the black sheep of the family, I was the one who reminded 
my mum of her past, which is why I think everything happened to me.

‘I
received an out of court settlement, not because they weren’t admitting
liability but because of legal advice and I was awarded £20,000.’
