Click here for our live scorecard after England v Sri Lanka's second day at Lord's

The cry has been for positive, 
proactive cricket at the start of this new Test era and England 
responded, at least with the bat, by frolicking in the Lord’s sunshine 
yesterday to rattle along to their highest score against Sri Lanka.

There
 will rarely be better conditions than this but a team who had forgotten
 how to score 300, let alone build match-defining totals, made hay while
 the sun shone with a formidable 575 for nine. It means realistically 
there can only be one winner of this first Investec Test.

Paul
 Downton set out his stall by making it clear here that winning will not
 be enough for Alastair Cook’s side. It must be done with style.

Best: Joe Root helped England secure an excellent opening innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's

‘We want a team that followers are proud of and want to identify with,’ said managing director Downton in the first Test programme. ‘We have to earn that right by playing pro-active cricket. We want to play  winning but positive cricket.’

So far, so good then, with Joe Root reaching an unbeaten double  hundred of some maturity on the second day of the Test summer and England scoring their runs at such a rate that Cook was able to declare well before tea.

Sri Lanka ensured it was not all plain sailing for England by then enjoying one of Mick Hunt’s perfect pitches themselves but, at 140 for one, they have much to do if they are to travel to Leeds with this mini-series still all square.

It was a reverse-swept four from, of all 
people, Jimmy Anderson that took England beyond the 551 for six they 
amassed here eight years ago against Sri Lanka.

The fact that England
 were unable to force a win in that 2006 game, with Andrew Flintoff 
bowling himself into the ground, shows there could be three long days 
ahead.

Yet, a side who were humiliated by Australia will be happy 
enough that they passed the first examination of their batting mix of 
old and new with a spring in their step.

None more so than Root, who 
added another hundred to the one he scored on Thursday to become, at 23,
 the fourth youngest Englishman to record a double century in Test 
cricket.

England sprang a surprise by asking Gary Ballance to bat at 
No 3 here and dropped Root to No 5, where he had made his maiden Test 
hundred against New Zealand on his Headingley home ground last summer.

Root
 looked immediately at home back in the middle order, filling the anchor
 role vacated by Jonathan Trott and showing that England will not have 
to rely totally on Cook and Ian Bell to provide the right example for 
their callow colleagues.

Root was able to scamper along at a steady 
pace thanks to the support he received, even after Matt Prior and then 
Chris Jordan had fallen to Sri Lanka’s fastest bowler in  Shaminda 
Eranga and their very own ‘Bodyline’ tactics.

The short ball may have
 done the trick for Sri Lanka but it had little effect as the second day
 wore on, with Stuart Broad, who last week declared his intention to 
attack with the bat, flaying a tiring attack that became increasingly 
ragged.

Dive: Kaushal Silva, who past his half-century, avoids Jordan's bouncer at Lord's

By the time Broad had smacked 47 from 38 balls and Liam 
Plunkett, surely England’s best No 10 in years, had added 39, Sri Lanka 
were looking as woeful here as England had appeared in the field at 
Sydney in the final Ashes Test.

Even after scoring 575 in 130 overs 
there were some voices in the commentary box claiming England could have
 been less conservative, yet they can hardly have done more to fulfil 
Downton’s mission statement when Cook declared after Root had reached 
his landmark.

The last time Root batted at Lord’s he had scored 180 
against Australia and this monumental effort came just a day after his 
brother Billy scored a double century of his own for Notts 2nd XI 
against Derbyshire. A good week then for this impressive cricketing 
family from Sheffield.

It was always going to be harder against Sri 
Lanka’s batsmen than bowlers but England did not get much luck. Dimuth 
Karunaratne was given out lbw to Anderson by Paul Reiffel in the first 
over but technology, incredibly, insisted the ball would have gone over 
the stumps.

Then Prior appeared to catch Kaushal Silva on 39 but the 
umpires abdicated responsibility and, after an eternity, TV official 
Steve Davis could not be sure the ball carried.

But Prior insisted: 
‘I felt it carry. ‘My gloves have got rubber tips in them, and I felt 
the ball go right in. There’s no doubt in my mind that it did carry. I’m
 disappointed the decision didn’t stand but that’s cricket and we move 
on.’

Just as unsatisfactory was the fact that six overs remained 
unbowled at the close even after a half-hour extension, an unacceptable 
rate with Sri Lanka the principal offenders.

At least there was one 
positive moment in the field for England when Jordan took the only 
wicket to fall with his third ball in Test cricket and celebrated as 
joyously as Root had enjoyed his hundreds. New era and two positive, proactive stars for the here and now in Root and Jordan.

England can be satisfied with that, even if they struggle to win here.
