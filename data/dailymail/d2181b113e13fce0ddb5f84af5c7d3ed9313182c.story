A schoolboy who weighed 16-and-a-half stone has shed nearly a third of his body weight after pumping iron at his local gym.

Aged 11, Byron Jones was clinically obese, painfully self-conscious and too breathless to play football with his friends.

But after visiting a gym in his home town of Holyhead in North Wales, the youngster decided to turn his life around.

Then and now: Byron Jones, of Holyhead, North Wales, shed nearly a third of his body weight after pumping iron at his local gym. Above, Byron is pictured aged 11, weighing 16-and-a-half stone (left) and at 17 years old (right)

Six years on, he has lost five stone - and has even become one of Britain's young weightlifting champions.

Byron, now 17, said his incredible transformation began after he visited Holyhead and Anglesey Weightlifting and FItness Centre.

He said he found pumping iron difficult at first because of his small size - but thanks to the dedication of club owner, Ray Williams, he decided to keep training.

'I was desperately overweight and not very happy,' said Byron. 'A lot of it was down to large portions and bad choices. I would go to the park with my friends to play football, but wouldn't be able to play for very long because I would be out of breath.

'I didn't have a lot of confidence, but then some friends encouraged me to go along to the weightlifting club.

'I started to take it seriously and managed to lose a lot of weight in just over 18 months. It completely transformed my life.'

And Byron's dedication has not only helped him to shed weight - as he has also gone on to win a string ofÂ Welsh and British weightlifting championships.

The teenager, who is qualified to coach 
in fitness, cricket and other sports, now juggles his A-levels with 
working as a fitness instructor at the club, encouraging other youngsters to get fit.

'I really like being able to encourage the other young people to lead healthy lives,' said Byron, whose diet has completely changed over the past six years.

'I can show them what can be achieved. My best piece of advice would be that everything is achievable if you put your mind to it.

'If you are consistent and keep going, you can do anything. It does take dedication, but it can be done.'

Following his amazing weight loss, Byron was highlighted by the National Lottery's Good Causes scheme as an inspirational young person.

He is now set to feature in a new film that focuses on young people who teach, volunteer and 'make a difference' at lottery-funded projects across Wales.

Jackie O'Sullivan, director of the National Lottery Good Causes, said: 'These young people are just a few of many everyday heroes using National Lottery funding to change lives across Wales.'
