Garden guru: Bob Flowerdew advised a studio member to put their pet rabbit under a trampoline to save space in the garden

A BBC gardening expert has horrified animal welfare experts by suggesting that a woman keeps her family's pet rabbit beneath a trampoline to save space.

Garden guru Bob Flowerdew was answering a question at a live recording of cult Radio 4 programme Gardeners' Question Time at the Chelsea Flower Show when he made the suggestion.

Audience member Jane Wood had asked the panel about ways she could cope with her children and pets in a small garden.

Mr Flowerdew told her: 'The first thing you can do is put the rabbit under the trampoline - that will economise on space.'

Although the audience roared with laughter at the suggestion, fellow panellist Matthew Wilson warned that the pet would likely be flattened.

The RSPCA also warned rabbit owners to disregard the advice. A spokesman said: 'Putting an animal under a trampoline while it is in use could cause distress.

'The RSPCA would urge people not to follow this advice, even if it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek.'

'Rabbits are active animals. They need the opportunity to hop, run, jump, dig, stand fully upright on their back legs and stretch out fully when lying down.

'It is very important you provide your rabbits with a secure living environment that is large enough for them to exercise in and stand up fully on their back legs without their ears touching the roof.'

'As rabbits are a prey species - they also need to be able to hide in a secure place, away from the sight and smell of predators (e.g. foxes, cats, dogs, ferrets and birds of prey).'

Not funny: The RSPCA said people should not follow Mr Flowerdew's advice even if it was meant to be tongue in cheek as it could cause distress to a rabbit

A BBC spokesman said that Mr Flowerdew's comments were not intended to be taken seriously.

They said: 'It will have been clear to listeners at home, not least from the studio audience’s laughter and the light-hearted tone of the exchange between Bob and the other panellists, that Bob’s comments should be taken with a generous helping of scepticism and humour.'
