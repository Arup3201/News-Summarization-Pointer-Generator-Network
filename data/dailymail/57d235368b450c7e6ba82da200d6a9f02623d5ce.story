She's topped global best dressed lists and proved her fashion prowess on last year's X Factor, so it made sense for Nicole Scherzinger to channel her style expertise into a clothing line. 

So successful was her debut range of bodycon dresses and glamorous partywear for Missguided earlier this year that the singer-turned-designer has unveiled her second range for the e-tailer.

The range doesn't launch until tomorrow but as these behind the scenes shots show, we can expect big things.

Behind the scenes with Nicole: Miss Scherzinger will unveil her second range for Missguided tomorrow but in the meantime, she's treated us to these teaser images

Nicole can be seen posing in a studio showcasing the 35-piece collection, which was inspired by her own style, as well as seasonal trends. 

Staying true to the sportsluxe theme that Nicole loves, there's plenty of cool bombers and dresses toughened up with leather sleeves.

Sleek dresses come with subtle sequin embellishment and gold chain detailing, making the range perfect for the Christmas party season.

Keen to keep things fresh, Nicole has added co-ords and sequin joggers, quilted A-line leather minis and boxy biker jackets with ribbed sleeve detailing.

The purse-friendly collection, which is priced between £20-£45, lands online tomorrow.

While the singer showcases an enviable physique in the behind the scenes imagery, Nicole shared her diet secrets with us and you may be surprised to hear that she's partial to the odd cheese plait. 

She said: 'I travel a lot but I do love to cook when I'm at home. I love making pasta, because it's easy. I make a mean cheese plait, great chicken fajitas and teriyaki chicken with vegetables.'

Opening up about healthy eating habits and diets, Nicole said: 'Everyone has different body and blood types so it's best to just eat what makes you feel good.

'I believe that you should have everything in moderation. If I deprive myself, I want it ten folds and I'll go the opposite way.'

Get set! Nicole promises that her new campaign will be explosive and judging by these behind the scenes pictures, the professional poser isn't lying

What's her secret? Sharing her tips for getting in shape, Nicole said squats, coconut water and running are essential

Reasonable: The new range is priced between £20-£45 and hopes to offer something for everyone

We know you don't get a killer bod like Nicole's without working out and she says she does lots of exercise and never eats late at night. 'Running works so well for me,' she said. 'I get my best ideas when I run, it's great for me. It strengthens my mind and puts me in the best state of mind.

'I get my ideas for what I want to do on stage and my music when I run. I prefer doing it in the morning, first thing. Even if I just manage to squeeze in twenty minutes.

'I do Soul Cycle classes in LA and bikram yoga and then interval training 3-4 times per week. My body starts to crave the endorphins if I don't work out.'

Sharing her tips for getting a body as toned as hers, Nicole said squats, coconut water and running are essential.

To achieve her glowy skin, Nicole swears by just 'lots of water, moisturiser, illuminator and a shimmery highlighter.'

The singer  is currently on the busy promotional tour for her upcoming album, Big Fat Lie. 

Speaking about re-launching her music career, she said: 'It's so great and very exciting. I've really come into my own sound, it doesn't sounds like anything that's on the market.'

Street style: Nicole regularly tops best dressed lists and knows how to flatter her figure so she's the perfect person for the design job at Missguided

She's back! Nicole, who is making a musical comeback, performs at Brandon Voss Presents Marquee Thursdays  at Marquee Club last week in New York
