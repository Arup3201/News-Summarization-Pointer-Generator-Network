A nine-year-old boy is dying from a rare form of brain cancer after telling his mother to stop his painful treatments after battling the disease for five years.

Ryan Kennedy, from Clarkston, Michigan, has undergone seven surgeries, two rounds of radiation and four different kinds of chemo since he was diagnosed with ependymoma at the age of four.

But Ryan, who recently became a trending topic on Twitter after it was thought to be his dying wish, has decided to suspend his treatment after a scan in February revealed his tumours had doubled in size from November.

'When I told him about it, he said "No! I told you Mom, I don’t want to do anything anymore." He literally just screamed and cried, in hysterics, saying, "I’m done. I’m done with this,"' his mother Kimberly Morris-Karp told the Oakland Press.

‘He just decided he didn’t want to take any more pills [and] he didn’t want any more surgery because it hurt,’ she added to CNN. ‘He just wanted to live the rest of his life.’

Today will be the last Mother’s Day Morris-Karp will spend with her son, who is not expected to make it to his tenth birthday on May 24.

‘[I will] rub his feet, help him with whatever he needs,’ the mother-of-three said. ‘I just plan on being there and just loving him through this.’

Worldwide attention: The nine-year-old recently became a trending topic on Twitter after it was thought to be his dying wish

Happy: Ryan, pictured here with his two siblings, said he has been touched by the support he has received from everyone from Britney Spears to Kim Kardashian

Ryan’s inspirational story has spurred an outpouring of love from everyone from Britney Spears to Kim Kardashian after his peers at Clarkston’s North Sashabaw Elementary School said it was his dying wish to trend on Twitter.

Morris-Karp told how her son had been touched by the support - even though he did not know the social media site existed.

‘Ryan really wasn’t the one who wanted to trend on Twitter - he’s nine - he doesn’t have a twitter account. He really didn’t even know what Twitter was,’ she told CNN.

But Ryan cried when he saw Britney Spears’ tweet. ‘You know, Mommy, this really touches my heart, that so many people are out there Tweeting, and caring about me,’ he told his mother, according to the Oakland Press.

His mother said his dying wish is to raise funds and awareness about brain cancer so more research into the deadly disease can be conducted.

‘Ryan is doing pretty good at this point. He is holding his own, he’s sleeping most of the time but he has very cognitive, clear moments at times where he communicates very well with us,’ Morris-Karp said. ‘But he’s just hanging in there.’
