The Queen's favourite meal is said to be a traditional Sunday roast, with her cooks well aware that she prefers the best organic beef.

So exactly what her royal highness would make of a frozen food firm's unlikely Diamond Jubilee tribute isn't clear.

National high street frozen food chain Iceland has used 3,000 duck spring rolls to recreate Buckingham Palace ahead of jubilee celebrations on Tuesday, June 5.

Food artist Prudence Staite created the three-metre long palace to mark the Queen's 60th year on the throne.

The piece has been named Duckingham Palace as a nod to its unusual building blocks.

Ms Staite took a week to put the piece together at her studio in Tewkesbury. But it took a mammoth effort to finish the job as the Gloucestershire town was flooded half way through the project.

The lorry-loads of duck spring rolls that were being ferried in daily for Duckingham Palace were delayed, but determined drivers made sure the piece still came together.

An Iceland spokesman said: 'We wanted 
something different, something unique to help celebrate our Jubilee 
campaign using some of Iceland’s most famous and popular party food.

'We 
are really pleased with the results and hope Her Majesty likes it too.

'We’re so excited about the extended Jubilee weekend and hope we can do our bit to make it the biggest party weekend Britain has seen in a long, long time.'
