A woman whose husband accidentally sold her $23,000 wedding ring for just $10 revealed today that it has now been returned.

Racquel Cloutier, 31, from Laguna Niguel, California,
 had been recovering in hospital after welcoming her fifth child when her husband, 
Eric, sold some seemingly unused items from their home at a 
community garage sale on June 1st.

Unbeknown to him, though, she had hidden her precious ring in an old watch box, which ended up being among the items for sale.

Relieved: Racquel Cloutier has had her $23,000 diamond wedding ring returned after her husband Eric accidentally sold it in a garage sale for $10

Valuable: Mrs Cloutier's diamond wedding ring is worth a staggering $23,000

Luckily, Alyssa Lossau
 who had been given the box by her mother, the buyer, happened to see a 
news story about the lost ring, and promptly emailed the couple to let 
them know it had been found.

By Thursday, Mrs Coutier's ring was firmly back on her finger, and her husband was no doubt breathing a sigh of relief.

Explaining why she had removed the ring in the first place, Mrs Cloutier told GMA: 'Whenever you're pregnant, your fingers start to swell so I thought it'd be a good idea to take it off. . .

Charitable effort: While his wife was recovering in hospital though, Mr Cloutier had been searching for some items that he and their older children could contribute to the sale

Recovering: Mrs Cloutier had been in hospital after welcoming her fifth child when her ring was sold

Out of reach: Mrs Cloutier had been worried that her two-year-old twins would get their hands on her jewelry

'Before I went to the hospital, I put my ring in 
that box. I wanted the ring to be in a safe place and out of reach from 
my two-year-old twins.'

While she was recovering in hospital 
though, her husband had been searching for some items that he and their 
older children could contribute to the sale.

'I saw the box and said, "Oh, this could be something nice. We don't use that,"' Mr Cloutier said.

Honest: Alyssa Lossau (right) who had been given the box by her mother, happened to see a news story about the lost ring, and promptly emailed the Cloutiers

Mrs Cloutier told ABC News that she realized her ring was missing when she came home from hospital on June 5th.

'I go into my husband’s closet, can’t find the box, and then he tells me
 he sold it,' she recalled.

'I said, "You sold it? What do you mean you sold it?" I 
immediately started crying.'

Mr Cloutier, who felt 'really terrible,' said the box was purchased by a blonde woman (Mrs Lossau's mother) who had been mulling over whether to buy it or not.

Grateful: The two women embrace as Mrs Lossau returns the missing ring

Staying firmly in place: Mrs Cloutier says she won't be removing her ring again for a long time

The Cloutiers were understandably very grateful to Mrs Lossau and her husband for returning the ring, and have offered to make a donation to the charity of their choice as a mark or their gratitude.

'You just can't ask for a better ending 
to a story,' Mrs Cloutier, said.

'I 
don't think I'll be taking it off anytime soon.'
