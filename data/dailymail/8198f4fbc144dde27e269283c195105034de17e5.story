TJ Jackson was made a co-guardian of Michael Jackson's three children last year, sharing custody with his grandmother Katherine.

But the late superstar's nephew TJ has reportedly moved 76 miles away from where Paris, 15, Prince, 16, and Blanket, 11, live in LA, without informing Child And Family Services.

The authorities are said to have discovered that the 34-year-old now lives two hours away when they inspected the Calabasas home where the 15-year-old reportedly tried to commit suicide on Wednesday, and will now be investigating.

'Left the area': TJ Jackson, who is Paris' co-guardian, has reportedly moved 76 miles away from the teen without informing the correct authorities

A source told The New York Post: 'They thought he was living around the corner. They were totally surprised by this. They’ve said they’re going to need a few days to sort this out.'

'So the bottom line is we have an 83-year-old woman raising teenagers by herself, and that just won’t fly,' they added.

TJ is said to have upped sticks and left the area a few months ago and relocated to the town of Corona, and reported failed to tell the correct authorities.

But a separate source, close to the estate, said: 'They [the executors] are very satisfied with him.There is no issue.'

Different towns: While he used to live in Calabasas, it seems that the singer now lives a two hour drive from the three children

Joint custody: TJ and his grandmother Katherine Jackson are currently hold a joint guardianship for the three children

The singer, who was appointed co-guardian of his uncle's children last year, was chosen because of his responsible nature and his close proximity to the family.

He was made their temporary guardian when his grandmother Katherine went to a spa in Arizona in July 2012 and was reportedly out of contact.

But her guardianship rights were reinstated a little while later after a lengthy court battle, and she now shares the duties with her grandson.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, documents obtained in March show that Tito Jackson's son currently receives $9,000 a month for his duties as co-guardian.

The documents filed with the LA 
Superior Court state that, at the time, TJ spent four or five days a 
week in the children's home with them, clocking up an estimated 60-80 
hours a week.

The singer lived in a residence close by by with his wife and three children before he reportedly relocated.

Showing the strain: Paris' mother Debbie Rowe was seen leaving the hospital in Los Angeles where her daughter was put on psychiatric hold

Jackson's mother Debbie Rowe, grandmother Katherine and aunt La Toya 
Jackson were all spotted visiting her at her LA hospital after she was 
admitted after her suicide attempt.

Sources say that while Paris is close to the Jackson matriach, she has been searching for more guidance.

'Paris loves her grandmother but feels that Katherine can't provide for her emotional needs,' an insider tells People magazine.

'She and Katherine are close, but it just isn't working for Paris. 
That's why Paris has turned to Debbie Rowe. There is something missing 
in Paris's life. The family hasn't really taken this serious.'

Another source adds that Katherine has been distracted with Michael's wrongful death court case.

'[Paris]
loves Katherine, but Katherine is dealing with the trial – and 
Katherine is an old woman. Just getting to the trial and back is a big 
deal for Katherine. She's not really capable of giving Paris all the 
support she needs,' says the insider.

Paris has recently started spending time with Debbie, but Prince 
Michael feels 'betrayed' and has called Paris a 'backstabber'

If Debbie Rowe, 54, seeks legal custody of her daughter Paris, she could leave the Jackson family compound in Calabasas

Paris' brother Prince Michael, 16, was pictured in Los Angeles on Thursday with his girlfriend Remi Alfalah.

The young couple were spotted shopping at an upmarket department store - perhaps picking out a suitable get-well-soon gift for his sister Paris - before joining Remi's family for a low-key pizza dinner.

Prince cancelled his TV engagements for the day and according to RadarOnline.com visited Paris on Thursday at the hospital.

The siblings reportedly had 'feuded' recently over Paris spending time with her biological mother Debbie Rowe, with Prince disapproving of their recent reconciliation.

A source said Prince put their differences aside after the suicide attempt.

'Prince stepped up, as he always does and told Paris how much he loves her in a phone call and vowed to help her in the aftermath of the suicide attempt,' the source said.

Meanwhile, a source told People, 'Paris is doing well, smiling again and can't wait to see her friends.'
