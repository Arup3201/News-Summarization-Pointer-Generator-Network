Paula Deen made an unexpected return to daytime television on Wednesday with a surprise appearance on ABC's The Chew.

The disgraced celebrity chief was infamously dropped by the Food Network in 2013 after she admitted in court to using racial slurs, but all of that was forgiven and forgotten on the weekday cooking program where she was introduced as a 'friend of the show'.

Deen first featured in a pre-recorded segment where she and presenter Carla Hall had taken a trip to Miami as the show celebrated Spring Break.

Disgraced celebrity chief Paula Deen, who was dropped by the Food Network in 2013 after she admitted in court to using racial slurs, made an unexpected return to daytime television on Wednesday's The Chew

'I'm in for trouble,' said a beaming Deen, before hamming it up in a salsa dancing scene.

Back in the studio Deen was in her element cooking up a pan full of fried chicken to which she added half a stick of butter more than the recipe required.

Deen, looking slimmer after losing 40lb in the wake of her Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, was introduced by presenter Michael Symon as 'our good friend'. 

'It's like coming to see family,' said the celebrity cook who also found time to plug her new game Paula Deen's Recipe Quest. 'It's easy ya'll!'

Deen's boisterous good humur got rather crass at one point when she scolded Clinton Kelly for eating hot wings with a knife and fork.

'You look like a turd in a punch bowl,' she said to groans from the studio audience.

During Celebrity Egg Timers, a quick fire question round, she even admitted to a secret crush on Justin Bieber and said her biggest fault was talking too much.

Deen's appearance on The Chew drew a mixed reaction on Twitter with many people voicing their displeasure at the show, while others were happy to welcome the disgraced celebrity chef back to daytime television.

In the same week that students were expelled from Oklahoma University for using the N-word, at least one person thought it ironic that Deen was back on television.

In 2012 Deen was sued by a former employee who claimed the then-beloved Southern chef and her brother had made racist remarks at their Savannah, Georgia restaurant.

In a court deposition, she admitted to using the 'N word' and later released a video, in tears, apologizing for the incident.

'I is what I is, and I'm not changing,' she famously told Today show host Matt Lauer.

'If there is anyone out there that has never said something that they wish they could take back, please pick up that stone and throw it so hard that it kills me.'

Deen was adamant when she told Lauer that she had only uttered the N-word once.

'The day I used that word, it was a world ago,' she said. 'It was 30 years ago.' 

Deen was then dropped by the Food Network, where she was a host for 13 years, as well as Wal-Mart and Target. She also lost a book deal with Ballantine Books.
