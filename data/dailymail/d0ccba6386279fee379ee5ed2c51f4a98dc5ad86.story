Ex-CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, during an address to members of the military Tuesday evening and said he hoped his infidelity could be 'instructive' to others who 'stumble or indeed fall as far as [he]  did.'

'I know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and a number of others,' Petraeus said at a University of Southern California event honoring the military in his first public speech since the affair. 'I can, however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings, and as best possible to make amends to those I have hurt and let down, and that is what I will strive to do.'

He said he hoped that his affair would steer others from making the same mistakes.

'This has obviously been a very difficult
episode for us,' he said, referring to his family. 'But perhaps my experience can be instructive to others 
who stumble or indeed fall as far as I did. One learns, after all, that 
life doesn't stop with such a mistake. It can, and must, go on.'

'And the effort to move forward over the rocky path of one's making is vital, inescapable, and ultimately worth it,' he added.

Petraeus made the comments to a group of about 600 people, 
including many veterans at the University of Southern California's 
annual ROTC dinner.

He was invited to speak at the dinner a year ago, before his affair became public.

'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said at the start of his remarks. 'I am also keenly aware that the reason for my recent journey was my own doing. So please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret - and apologize for - the circumstances that led me to resign from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters.'

Petraeus has remained largely in seclusion since resigning.

His lawyer, Robert B. Barnett, has said that Petraeus has spent much of that time with his family.

Regret: 'I know that I can never fully assuage 
the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and a number of 
others,' Petraeus said

Public setting: The speech hints that he is planning a return to public life

Approval: Petraeus received applause and a standing ovation before he began the evening's program by cutting a cake, a task reserved for the highest ranking person in the room

Petraeus received applause and a standing ovation before he began the evening's program by cutting a cake, a task reserved for the highest ranking person in the room.

His affair with the retired four-star general's biographer, Paula Broadwell, was discovered during an FBI investigation into emails she sent to another woman she viewed as a rival for his attention.

At the time, Petraeus told his staff he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment.'

'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,' he said.

After the affair, he testified behind
closed doors about the Benghazi attack but kept out of the public eye 
after the very powerful media storm which blew up in the wake of the 
scandal.

In recent 
months, however, Petraeus has increasingly appeared in public for 
lunches and dinners with former colleagues, foreign officials, members 
of Congress and policy experts.

As the military leader credited with 
reshaping the nation's counterinsurgency strategy, turning the tide in 
the U.S. favor in both Iraq and Afghanistan and making the U.S. safer 
from terrorism, Petraeus expected a friendly audience at the ROTC 
dinner.

At least one expert in crisis 
communications said that if his apology comes across as heartfelt and 
sincere, the public will indeed be seeing much more of him.

Family: Petraeus has been married to wife Holly for 38 years and they have two children together

'America is a very forgiving nation,' 
said Michael Levine who, among dozens of other celebrity clients, 
represented Michael Jackson during his first child molestation 
investigation.

'If he follows the path of humility, 
personal responsibility and contrition, I submit to you that he will be 
very successful in his ability to rehabilitate his image,' he said.

Another longtime crisis communications
expert, Howard Bragman, said Petraeus has handled the situation 
perfectly so far and he expects he'll continue to do so.

He noted that unlike former President 
Bill Clinton, former U.S. Senator John Edwards and other public figures 
caught in extramarital affairs, Petraeus didn't try to lie his way out 
of it, immediately took responsibility and moved on.

'I think the world is open to him now,' said Bragman, vice chairman of the image-building company Reputation.com.

'I think he can do whatever he wants. 
Realistically, he can even run for public office, although I don't think
he'd want to because he can make more money privately.'

Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student

Ahead of the speech, Petraeus drew 
lavish praise from USC's president, C. L. Max Nikias, who called him 
'arguably the most effective military commander since Gen. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower.'

'In our post 9/11 world, General 
Petraeus' influence on our military is unmatched, and his contributions 
to the CIA are far-reaching,' Nikias said. '

While at USC, Petraeus also planned to
visit faculty and students at the Price School of Public Policy, which 
administers the ROTC program, and USC's School of Social Work, which 
trains social workers in how to best help veterans returning from war.
