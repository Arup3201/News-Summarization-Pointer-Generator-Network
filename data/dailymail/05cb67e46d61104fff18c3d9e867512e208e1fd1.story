A Christian-run bakery that triggered a discrimination row when it refused to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan will fight the case in court rather than pay a 'modest' settlement. 

Ashers Baking Company refused in May to bake the cake printed with the words 'support gay marriage'. 

The cake was also to have had pictures of two characters from Sesame Street, the name of the group, Queerspace, and the year it was founded, 1998.

The cake was ordered to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, but Daniel McArthur (left) refused to bake it citing his religious beliefs

The order, placed by gay rights activist Gareth Lee, was originally accepted by employees but the bakery later decided it was against its beliefs.

The bakery's owner, Daniel McArthur, said he should not have to promote a cause he does not believe in.

Mr McArthur - who is being financially backed by the Christian Institute - has refused the compensation request. 

'We’re continuing to hold to the stand that we took originally because we believe it’s biblical, we believe it’s what God would want us to do,' he said.

'We feel that the Equality Commission are pursuing us because of our beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman,' he said.

'We also think that if we do cave in to the Equality Commission at this point it’ll put pressure on other citizens who are defending their view of traditional marriage.'

He said God's 'purposes will prevail' as the case unfolds.  

The Equality Commission wrote to baking company last month stating that they would be seeking compensation on the grounds of discrimination.

'Biblical stand': Daniel McArthur said his family bakery shouldn't have to promote marriage equality.

They said on October 27 that Mr McArthur had a week to pay or civil action would be launched. 

The Christian Institute says the Equality Commission has 'dreamed up' its case against the bakery.

'It is simply baffling for a body supposedly working for equality to be threatening a Christian family, all because of a cake,' said spokesman Simon Calvert.

'The Equality Commission has taken four months to dream up new grounds on which to pursue the McArthur family, claiming that they’ve breached political discrimination laws.'

He told the MailOnline: 'You can't put a price on conscience.

'The Equality Commission seems to think that some people's conscience is worth more than others.'

Mr Calvert said the bakery had received support from people who do not believe the McArthur's views, but nevertheless respect his right to voice them.

He also said thousands of dollars had been raised to support the bakery in its legal fight.

'This is a David-verse-Goliath battle against a state-backed organisation,' he said. 

In a statement the Commission said: 'In its letter the Commission stated that they would prefer not to have to litigate these issues and sought an acknowledgement that there has been an unlawful breach of the equality laws and an assurance that this will not be repeated.' 

Ashers Baking Company has seven outlets and said it has received community support in its fight

In the past the courts have said it is wrong for Christians to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of their sexuality.

Judges have also said it is right for Christians to be fired from their jobs for refusing to take part in same-sex civil partnership ceremonies or for saying they would not give sex therapy to same-sex couples.

But the challenge to the Christian-run Ashers Baking Company is the first likely legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns. 

A July ComRes poll found that six in 10 Britons though it was ‘disproportionately heavy-handed’ to drag the bakery company to court because of its beliefs.
