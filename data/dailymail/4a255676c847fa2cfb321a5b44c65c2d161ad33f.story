She is a two-time Oscar-winning actress.

But Dianne Wiest is reportedly struggling to find enough work to afford her New York City apartment.

Speaking to the New York Times, the 66-year-old explained how she finds it difficult to earn enough film and television roles to pay the rent on her home, believed to be in Manhattan's West 79th Street.

'I have to move out of my apartment soon,' she admitted. A two-bed apartment at the actress's supposed apartment complex is currently advertised online at a rental price of $5,300 per month.

Ms Wiest also revealed she never attempts to re-invent herself for a role. Instead, she leaves it to fate.

'I think that if it’s meant to happen, it will happen - which is I guess a real sign of stupidity,' said Ms Wiest, who has two adopted daughters, Emily and Lily, who are both now in their twenties.

Ms Wiest, who won her two Oscars for her performances in Hannah And Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway, was interviewed by the newspaper alongside actress Tonya Pinkins, 52. 

The pair are currently in rehearsals together for 'Rasheeda Speaking', a dark comedy about racism that was written by Chicago playwright Joel Drake. It is being directed by Cynthia Nixon.

Ms Wiest stars as Illeen, a white employee in a surgeon's office, while Ms Pinkins plays her African-American receptionist co-worker. They end up being driven apart by their boss's machinations.

Successful career: Ms Wiest, who was born in Kansas City, Missouri, is also well known for her work in Edward Scissorhands and The Birdcage. Above, Ms Wiest and Johnny Deppin Edward Scissorhands

During the interview, Ms Wiest  revealed that she accepted the role partly 'to explore my own latent racism', but often finds it hard to recover from some of the antagonistic scenes. 

Meanwhile, Ms Pinkins, who played Livia Frye on the soap opera All My Children, said that she chose to join the cast so she could 'be in the room with Cynthia and Dianne'.

Ms Wiest, who was born in Kansas City, Missouri, is also well known for her work in Edward Scissorhands and  The Birdcage. She previously dated New York talent agent, Sam Cohn.

Latest project: Tonya Pinkins, Dianne Wiest, playwright Joel Drake Johnson, director Cynthia Nixon, Patricia Conolly, and Darren Goldstein attend a photo call for the New Group production of 'Rasheeda Speaking'

With regard to television, she won her first Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Dramatic Series for her role in Road to Avonlea in 1989.

From 2000 to 2002, she portrayed interim District Attorney, Nora Lewin, in NBC's Law & Order.

Previews for 'Rasheeda Speaking' begin on Tuesday at the Signature Center.
