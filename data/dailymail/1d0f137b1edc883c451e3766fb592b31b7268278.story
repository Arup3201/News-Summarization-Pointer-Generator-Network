A 65-year-old former bartender from New South Wales has described the incredible moment he was shot in the stomach and left for dead by two armed robbers.

Dick McGuigan endured 15 surgeries and was left with a disfigured stomach wound after the two hooded men stormed the Water Board Bowling Club in Newcastle where he was working at the time.

Ryker Jenner and Joel Barton entered the club on a Sunday evening as a local meat raffle was finishing up, armed with a Ruger .223 mini-assault rifle and a screwdriver.

Dick McGuigan has shared his survival story about the day he was shot in the stomach after trying to protect patrons from an armed robber at a Newcastle bar he worked at

In an effort to defend his clientele, which included families with their young children, Mr McGuigan told Nine News that he tried talking to the robbers in an attempt to stall them before police arrived.

However Jenner and Barton only briefly verbally abused the man before attempting to flee the venue with a bag full of money.

Mr McGuigan said he and a few others then begun to follow the two men, hoping to record their number plate for police, when they noticed him.

'The gunman came back in. We stopped in our tracks and he was aiming the gun directly at me,' he said.

The 65-year-old said that he was shot after the two men caught him and a few others trying to get a glimpse of their number plate, with one of the men saying: 'Put one in the old guy'

After a clear direction from Jennar to 'Put one in the old guy', Barton shot the rifle directly into Mr McGuigan's stomach.

'I saw the flash, heard the bang and felt something hit me in the stomach. I put my hand down and there was blood on my fingers.'

Amazingly, after numerous surgeries and time in the intensive care unit, Mr McGuigan managed to survive to tell the tale.

The hollow bullet only just managed to miss his spine as he turned to the side moments before being shot.

Now, Mr McGuigan gives talks at other pubs and clubs across NSW about how to handle similar dangerous situations.

The retiree is also adamant for the scar on his stomach to be the only one he's left with, saying: 'They've ruined their lives. They're not going to ruin mine'.

Jenner and Barton were hunted down by police and found guilty of the shooting as well as robbery earlier this year.

Jennar has been sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in jail while Barton’s sentence will be handed out later in the year.
