A truck driver apparently lost on a New Jersey highway, made an illegal U-turn and ended up killing a mother and her two young sons in a deadly crash Friday evening.

The crash between the truck and the SUV carrying five people happened at around 6:30pm Friday on Route 1 in Lawrence, Mercer County prosecutors told The Times of Trenton.

45-year-old Richard Williams of Brooklyn was making an illegal U-turn driving a tractor-trailer when the family's SUV ran into it.

Killed in the crash were 25-year-old Jamella Tisdale, her infant son, Jaden, and her 9-year-old son, Jaevon Durante, all of Levittown.

The infant's father, Shaqwan Tisdale, and the woman's 8-year-old daughter, Mellady Durante, remained hospitalized Saturday in stable condition.

'His whole family is torn apart,' friend Deborah Sedam told NBC Philidelphia. 'He was crying and asking God for help.'

First Assistant Prosecutor Angelo Onofri said it did not appear that speed or drugs, drugs or alcohol were a factor in the accident and that everyone was wearing their seat belts.

'It appears like the truck driver was lost in the area,' Onofri told NJ.com.

Emergency responders found the SUV 
wedged under the bed of the tractor-trailer, and crews had to stabilize 
the truck's bed before they could extricate the passengers.

It took several hours to free the victims from the wreckage, Trenton Battalion Chief Robert Tharp said.

The
truck driver, 45-year-old Richard Williams, of New York City's Brooklyn
borough, was charged with three counts of death by auto and was being 
held on $100,000 bail.
