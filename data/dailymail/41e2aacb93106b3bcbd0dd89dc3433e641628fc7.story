A Marine who lost most of his jaw and an eye after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan will receive the Medal of Honor next month.

Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, will receive the nation's top military award at a White House ceremony on June 19, becoming the eighth living recipient for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq.

President Obama will present the medal to Carpenter, who is from Flowood, Mississippi.

He was just 21 when he intentionally 
threw his body over a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas 
Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010.

Enemy forces, which had moved in while
 hidden by walls from a compound across the street, lobbed three 
grenades into the patrol base. One injured an Afghan National Army 
soldier, the second did not detonate and the third landed close to Carpenter and Eufrazio.

Carpenter, who was working as a machine gunner, placed himself between the 
grenade and Eufrazio to shield him. The blast deflected down, with 
Carpenter absorbing most of the explosion.

'My last few seconds before I lost consciousness, I had accepted the fact that... I was not going to survive and make it off that rooftop,' he told the Washington Post.

But he did survive - although he suffered life-threatening injuries. He lost his right eye and most of the teeth and suffered a broken jaw and arm, which left him heavily scarred.

Scars: The 24-year-old's right arm also shattered in dozens of places, leaving him heavily scarred

Ink: He shows off his tattoo, which reads: 'Blessed be the Lord my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle', which is Psalm 144

Eufrazio also survived the attack but the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it took him more than two years to be able to talk again.

After the blast, Carpenter underwent more than 30 surgeries, including brain surgery, and has been fitted with a glass eye. He spent two-and-a-half years in hospital - but he's not bitter about it.

'I look back and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,' Carpenter said, according to the Marine Corps.

Carpenter was a patient at Walter Reed
 National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, until he 
medically retired last July. He is now a student at the University of South Carolina.

There has been some debate over exactly what happened before the explosion, as Carpenter said he was unable to remember what had happened and there were no witnesses to the event.

But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life.

Hospitalman 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade.

He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso.

'Grenade blasts blow up; they don't blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in 2012. 'If he hadn't done it, what we found would have looked completely different.'

Still, the veteran, who had been in 
Afghanistan for five months before the blast, told the Washington Post that he 
wasn't comfortable with wearing the Medal of Honor.

Battle: Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw

Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places

'There
 are guys who I was with who didn't come back, so itâ€™s hard for me to 
wear this and have the spotlight on me the rest of my life when they 
lost their life on a hot, dusty field in Afghanistan and most people 
don't even know their names,' he said.

'Even
 at Walter Reed, I recovered with quadruple-amputees. How am I supposed 
to wear this knowing and seeing all the hardships that are much worse 
than mine that guys have gone through without any recognition?'

Even though he has since left the Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been featured as a guest of honor at several command events.

On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters.

'It's hard to comprehend that three years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan,' he wrote.

'At times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out of consciousness with my the final thought of "I'm going to die" in my head... And here I am.'

The Marine has also been celebrated as a hero across the nation - appearing on Katie Couric's show to talk about his experiences, and garnering thousands of fans on his Facebook page.

A formal recommendation for the award must be made within three years of the combat action.

So far in his presidency, Obama has presented the medal of honor to 39 members of the armed services.
