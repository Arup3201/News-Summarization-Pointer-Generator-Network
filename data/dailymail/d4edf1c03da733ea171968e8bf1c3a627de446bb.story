Most people on the night shift are yawning, sipping coffee and glumly watching the clock at 4.15am, but not newsreader Tia Ewing.

The anchor was caught shaking her booty on camera to Beyoncé's hit Single Ladies during an early morning ad break for California's Fox News 40.

Despite the late hour, dance floor diva Tia showed some pretty slick moves to her delighted colleagues as the former Destiny's Child singer's chart-topping song played in the background.

However, what she didn't realise was that her colleagues were recording her every move.

Slick: Newsreader Tia Ewing showed some serious rhythm as Beyonce played during an ad break. Her colleagues caught it on camera

Get into the groove: Despite the late hour, Tia danced exuberantly in the studio

Online: The video has proved popular online, attracting more than a hundred thousand views in a few hours

In the video Tia flashes her ring finger and waves her arm above her head as she spin before the video cuts away to the U.S. flag. When it goes back to the studio she is initially abashed but then continues dancing, to the delight of her colleagues.

Eventually a producer's arm sweeps across the screen, apparently to let the grinning journalist know she will soon be back on the air.

'I gotta get it where I can get it,' she explained to her co-workers on-air in a later segment, 'I just didn't know the camera was rolling.' Another anchor was impressed with her dancing. 'She got moves!', she enthused.

She later tweeted: ‘They caught me, BUSTED! Let's hope this doesn't go viral!’

Her hopes were dashed when the video clocked up more than 100,000 views on YouTube in just eight hours.

In her biog on the website of Fox 
News 40, a news station which covers Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto, 
she says: 'My goal every time I step in front of the camera is to be 
creative and tell it in a compelling yet unique way.

'When I am not working, you can catch me giving back or doing something spontaneous.'

Later on Tia quoted Austrian writer Vicki Baum on Twitter: 'There are short-cuts to happiness, and dancing is one of them.'

Tia's colleagues later joked about her spontaneous dancing, although one admitted she has 'moves'

Caught: She had no idea her co-workers had captured every moment of her routine

Oops: BBC News 24 weather presenter Thomas Schafernacker (left) gives his colleagues the finger in 2010. Natasha Kaplinsky (right) incorrectly announces live on air that Germany had been knocked out of the FIFA World Cup 2006

Other newsreaders to suffer embarrassing on air moments include the BBC's Natasha Kaplinksy, who wrongly announcing live on-air that Germany had been knocked out of the 2006 World Cup. In fact, the two teams were still playing at the time - and Germany went on to win the game on penalties.

In 2010 BBC News Channel viewers saw weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker brazenly sticking his middle finger up at breakfast show presenters Simon McCoy and Fiona Armstrong, who were off-camera.

Prior to the gaffe, caught live on BBC News 24, anchor McCoy seemed to gently poke fun at Schafernaker by saying: 'Now we will have the weather forecast in a minute and of course it will be 100 per cent accurate and provide all the detail you can possibly want.
