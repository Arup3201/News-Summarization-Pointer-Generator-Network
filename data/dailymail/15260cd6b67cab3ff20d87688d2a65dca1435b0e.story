New images taken from space show an island that formed last year after a volcanic eruption in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean is swallowing up a neighbouring island.

The land mass, named Niijima, was first spotted in November 2013, in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo, as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below.

Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time.

Overwhelmed: Niijima, was formed as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. It has now merged with its smaller pre-existing neighbour Nishino-shima

My, how you've grown: In this NASA satellite image from December 8, Niijima can be clearly seen next to the larger Nishino Shima

But the mass, located in the Pacific's volatile 'Ring of Fire', has grown rapidly to merge with its smaller pre-existing neighbour Nishino-shima, as these satellite images from the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 show.

The new landmass measures about 3,000ft across and has soared to a height of 200ft above sea level, reports the Huffington Post.

'The intermittent, pulsing shape of the cloud stream might be a reflection of the volcanic eruption itself,' officials from NASA's Earth Observatory said.

Growing presence: This picture was taken on December 6, just over two weeks after the island formed

Smoke billows from the new islet off the coast of Nishino Shima, a small, uninhabited island in the Ogasawara chain off the coats of Tokyo. At that point, it was around 600ft in diameter

The formation of the new island was the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years

'Strombolian explosions are essentially bubbles of lava and gas rising from Earth's interior in pulses.

'Underwater, sediment appears to be stirred up in a green plume that stretches eastward from the island.'

In September a similar new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan.

It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide.

The phenomenon on the coastline near the port of Gwadar caused astonishment when it emerged from the Arabian Sea, but experts from Pakistan's National Institute of Oceanography say it is now fast eroding.

Although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions, they are rarely as powerful as the one that formed Niijima.

The chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands.

The islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor.

Volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as 1,000C when it emerged.

Similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in Japan's territory that have since disappeared.

Experts initially said the islet, pictured, may not last long due to erosion, but it is still growing

The new islet rose into the ocean near the Bonin Islands, also known as the Ogasawara chain
