This summer's World Cup might have added a fourth star to Germany's shirts, but it also lost them some of their more experienced stars.

Captain Philipp Lahm, Arsenal's Per Mertesacker and World Cup record goalscorer Miroslav Klose all went out on the ultimate high into international retirement, taking with them the know-how that comes with 354 caps between them.

With injuries adding up too, Joachim Low gave the chance to some of the next generation of German stars. Here's Sportsmail's verdict on how they got on:

Sebastian Rudy

Age: 24

Position: Midfielder (played at right back against Scotland)

Club: Hoffenheim

Minutes played: 90

Rudy might not initially be considered 'young', but he's pretty new to the German national side and this was just his third cap - his second since the World Cup.

Scotland's mainly defensive outlook, particularly down the flanks allowed the Hoffenheim man to push forward into the positions he normally occupies in midfield - and it paid off for Thomas Muller's opener.

Drifting in a cross from deep, Rudy found Muller to head past David Marshall and give the home side the lead. And that was typical of his first-half performance, finding pockets of space out on the right and sending balls in to the box with Germany seemingly comfortable with dominating the wide areas. 

On the charge: Sebastian Rudy took the opportunity to get down the right flank and attacked Scotland

Resolute: Rudy slides in on Scotland's Ikechi Anya as the visitors try to launch a counter attack in Dortmund

His passing was perfect - 30 came in total during that dominant first period - and with a 100% completion rate. He even managed a shot on goal but his drive from 20 yards was well saved by Marshall on the half-hour mark.

The second half though was a bit of a different story though - he found himself ripped to shreds by Scotland's suddenly more potent counter-attacking game - and it was Rudy left miles out of position when Ikechi Anya steamed through down the left to equalise.

He constantly found himself troubled as the visitors got more into the game and his lack of familiarity with the position perhaps showed as Anya grew into the game.

Defensive duties: Rudy is used to being further up the pitch but did well at the back at times

Whoops! Anya hares away from Rudy as he is caught out with his positioning in an unfamiliar role

Erik Durm

Age: 22

Position: Left back 

Club: Borussia Dortmund

Minutes played: 90

Durm was another who benefited from Scotland's withdrawn positioning down the flanks - constantly pressing Barry Bannan back, restricting his creative skills and giving Germany a platform to attack.

He took his opportunities to go forward and was already setting up Muller for a chance just eight minutes into the game with a brilliant right-footed cross. 

Comfortable: Durm makes sure Charlie Mulgrew can't get a clean shot at goal during the first half

And he was able to mix it up too - with a 20-yard strike troubling Marshall as Scotland held firm.

He cynically brought down Steven Naismith as Scotland went in search of a second equaliser and was lucky not to see red - that aside it was a solid performance down the left from the Borussia Dortmund defender. 

Easy does it: And Durm guides the same man away from the penalty area on another Scotland counter

Seeing them off: Barry Bannan couldn't do anything to get away from Durm on this occasion

Christoph Kramer 

Age: 23

Position: Midfielder

Club: Bayer Leverkusen (on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach)

Minutes played: 90

A solid partner to Toni Kroos in midfield, Kramer proved an able deputy for German skipper Bastian Schweinsteiger and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira.

He made his first-ever competitive start in the World Cup final but that ended in injury - on this occasion he was able to play a more active role - sitting deep and sweeping up anything that evaded Kroos as he advanced through the middle. 

Getting forward: Christoph Kramer played alongside Toni Kroos but still got opportunities going forward

Good touch: Kramer takes control and moves away from Mulgrew as he performs in the German midfield pair

Kramer has been linked with Manchester United this week and his performance, adding steel to the German midfield, might just have impressed Louis van Gaal who is lookign for similar characteristics in the centre of the park.

Defensively he wasn't too frequently tested but he managed to see off a few Scottish attacks early on, nipping in to keep the pressure on the visitors in Dortmund. 

Careful: Kramer wins this duel to keep the pressure on Scotland as they tried to break away

Defensive duties: Kramer wins the ball above Darren Fletcher in the air as he won the midfield battle
