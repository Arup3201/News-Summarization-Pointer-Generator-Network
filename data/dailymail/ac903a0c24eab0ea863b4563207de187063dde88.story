A new mother was touched by the kindness of strangers who went out of their way to get formula milk for her baby when she was trapped in a traffic jam.

Shelley Ruck was caught in a 30-mile tailback in soaring temperatures after a cement truck collided with a heavy goods vehicle.

But some people who had gathered on a bridge near junction 34 of the M6, south of Lancaster, noticed her distress and came to her rescue.

New mother Shelley Ruck, 33, from Warrington was stranded with baby George in a nine hour traffic jam in soaring temperatures on the M6 with just one bottle of milk. But some Good Samaritans came to her rescue and went and fetched some formula

They drove for 20 minutes to the nearest shop and came back with a box of milk powder, two sterilised bottles filled with boiling water and a bottle of spring water which they lowered down to her from the bridge using a jerry can.

‘It was the kindest thing that anyone could have done,’ said Ms Ruck.

‘It was absolutely unbelievable. They saved us. My baby would have been hungry if it were not for their amazing thoughtfulness and kindness.’

Ms Ruck, from Warrington, was stuck until 11pm with her mother Denise and her eight-month-old baby George with just one bottle of formula milk.

The soaring temperatures saw police on the scene handing out water to dehydrated drivers.

She said: ‘There were people fainting and there was an old lady who had to be taken away in an ambulance because of the heat. Tensions among drivers were running high.

‘It was horrific. If George had woken up I would have had no milk and it would have been dire.’

The 30-mile tailback on the M6 was caused by a collision between a cement truck and a heavy good vehicle

She is keen to thank the mystery Good Samaritans, who would not accept payment for the money they spent.

She said: ‘I don't know who they were, but thank God they were there to help. I want to give them a massive thank you. What they did was unimaginable.’

Further along the M6, other drivers spoke of strangers who came to their rescue while they were stuck in the jam.

Matthew Jones, 21, was stranded in the tailbacks at junction 36 near Kendal.

He saw a farmer help people into his field so they could relieve themselves.

Mr Jones, a politics student from Cheshire, said he also saw lorry drivers manoeuvre their vehicles at an angle to provide much-needed shade to hot, dehydrated people stranded in the glaring sun.

‘Everyone pulled together,’ said Matthew.

‘We were all in a terrible position. I didn't have anything to eat or drink in the car but people who did have bottles of water or food were handing them around. There were strangers helping strangers in their hours of need.’

A spokesperson from the Highways Agency said it would have been unsafe for motorists to carry on driving before the road was cleared and thanked people for their patience.
