One Japanese company has discovered an ingenious way to combat the problem of food wastage... by converting udon noodles into electricity. 

In total, the company generates 180,000 kwH of electricity each year, enough to power about 50 households.

Chiyoda Manufacturing Company work with local udon producers and restaurants in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture to convert the methane released by the wheat noodles into energy. 

There are 800 udon noodle restaurants in the coastal city of Takamatsu. With the new tecnology the city's food waste is now converted to enough energy to power 50 households

In the  coastal city of Takamatsu, there are 800 restaurants all serving the region's speciality, Sanuki Udon. 

In a city of 400,000 inhabitants, that's one udon restaurant for every 500 inhabitants. 

At a local factory, Sanuki Mengy, udon noodles are produced and packaged, ready to be shipped all over Japan.

Every day, a maximum of 100,000 portions of udon noodles are produced. 

However only noodles with the perfect length and size are sold. Everything that doesn't meet the rigid criteria gets discarded, explains Kagawa Masaaki, president of the company. 

'We discard about 150 tonnes of udon noodles every year,' says Masaaki. 

'And that is not just from this factory, but also includes seven udon restaurants that produce Sanuki-udon noodles in the Kagawa prefecture.'

Until recently, the udon waste rotted away in landfills, releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

But with Chiyoda Manufacturing Company's technology, the gas is put to good use. 

At the company's plant, the dry udon noodles are first ground up to increase the surface area before being mixed with water.

The mixture then undergoes a fermentation process and various stages of purification which turns 10 per cent of it into ethanol.

Different temperature levels are used to separate water from ethanol. Ethanol is a highly combustible fuel which can be used for energy production and other purposes.

The company uses the remaining 90 per cent to produce biogases such as methane, which is used to generate electricity.

The process is still in testing phase and the engineers are working to optimise it.

Ozaki Tetsuo, engineer and head of Technology and Development at Chiyoda Manufacturing, explained: 'No matter how hard we try, there will always be some residue. So we are working on reusing the residue and developing a process that produces no waste at all.'

Currently, the company is working on turning the runoff liquid into a fertiliser for wheat and onion, which are ingredients and toppings, respectively, for a bowl of udon. Thus, the waste recycling scheme goes full circle.

In exchange for receiving the waste noodles for free, the company does not charge anything for picking up the waste from the restaurants and factories.

Eiji Iketsu, President of Chiyoda Manufacturing Company, emphasises the importance of recycling schemes like this.

'Biomass based recycling schemes are increasingly popular here in Japan. This is just the beginning. It is our task to promote and spread this technique further,' he says.

Back at the restaurant, people are enjoying their daily bowl of udon.

A customer has already heard of the udon recycling scheme and is impressed by it. 

But would he leave some of the udon in his bowl behind on purpose, knowing that it will be used to generate electricity?

'No. When I eat udon, it becomes my energy, so there is nothing wasted there.'

It seems the schemes biggest challenge is convincing locals to stop eating all their noodles.

Udon are thick, white noodles made from wheat flour and are typically served in a fish or miso broth.
