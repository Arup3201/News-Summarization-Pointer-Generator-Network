At first sight, it could be the catwalk equivalent of the emperor's new clothes.

And though the lithe models sashaying down the catwalk on the first day of New York Fashion Week were at least partially clad, Kanye West's debut collection for Adidas is not for the faint-hearted.

From nude body stockings to see-through skin-coloured crop tops, the outfits were entirely unforgiving - and strictly for the body confident. But while public opinion is still out, the bizarre ensembles do at least have one famous fan in the shape of Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian.

Wearable? It is yet to be seen whether every day fashion fans will be quick to snap up the designs

It should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally Kanye West ensured his wife (and muse) Kim Kardashian was the best dressed at his Adidas fashion show yesterday.

We're not used to seeing Miss Kimmy K. in anything but form fitting designer duds, but we're really loving this loose look on her. That Yeezy camo oversized jacket is everything! Unfortunately it's not available to buy just yet though.

The reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of Faith Connection camouflage pants just the other day. Take a page from Kim's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below.

Both Saint Laurent and Rag & Bone make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a Rothko jacket on sale for only $73.95! Our favorite item here at Fashion Finder HQ is a Levi's mixed media camo bomber, which at $140.00 is also a style steal.

The 34-year-old reality TV star liked the look so much, she even posted an Instagram photo of herself in one of the sheer ensembles, adding the legend: 'My look for the Yeezy show!!!!!! Yeezy head to toe!!!!!'

Critics similarly seemed to enjoy Kanye's latest fashion offerings with Vogue saying: 'Kanye West's New collection with Adidas lives up to the hype.'  

The very fact that he had the fashion bible's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, and top designer Alexander Wang sitting front row at the show was testimony to to Mr West's popularity.  

In a review posted on the fashion magazine's website they seem notably impressed at the fact that Kanye had managed to persuade Adidas to drop their traditional three stripe logo from his designs, a feat never achieved by their previous collaborators.

They said: 'Hems were raw and frayed, tops billowy, bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned Boosts. 

'There were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they’ve actually taken shrapnel, and everything was said to be unisex. 

Concluding: 'On display, in rigid lines of expressionless youth, it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear.' 

Sportswear: Kanye said he wanted to design a range of 'solutions based' clothing 

Different shapes and sizes: Kanye has been praised for using models of different shapes, sizes and races

However much like anything Kanye does the show didn't come without controversy.  

From guests complaining they had to wait an hour in the cold for the event to start, to his daughter North screaming the house down mid show.

And of course Kanye, who is known for his impassioned and sometimes angry rants, couldn't resist making a dig at the fashion industry, even whilst he was trying to impress them. 

In an early review of the collection, Women's Wear Daily commented that Kanye seems to be, 'perpetually running defense, clearly still wounded by the criticism directed at his previous design endeavors.' 

Indeed it was reported that he played a track over the top of the show telling his audience: 'I want to create something better for you.

'We have been limited. It's bigger than who I am even in my present living. It's about what when I was on earth what did I do to help?' 

He went on to say: 'I'm here to crack the pavement and make new ground.

'There's a lack of creativity in every field…people are afraid to create. I want people to think awesome is possible.' 

But did he manage to crack that pavement? Well, yes and no. 

Kanye certainly hasn't faced the same level of criticism that he has for his previous forays into the fashion world.  

Praised: The show is the first time Kanye has received praise for his attempts at fashion design

Casual: As well as the body suits some models wore relaxed sweatshirts and jumpers

Family affair: Kim's younger sister Kylie Jenner was featured in the show rocking a parred back look

Refinery 29  noted that Kanye's collection probably would sell well saying: 'It was a lineup of oversized jackets, sweatshirts, sweaters, and leggings, interspersed with Vanessa Beecroft-esque nude-colored underwear. 

'A camo parka that Kim Kardashian also wore was a highlight, and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials.' 

He has also been praised for using a variety of models, notably men and women of different races, shapes and sizes.

'Short, tall, sample size, not sample-size...while the diversity in the show wasn't quite a true-to-life cross-section of America (or even the subway car during your morning commute), it was a more interesting line-up of bodies than what we normally see during New York Fashion Week,' said Refinery.

One notable face was his wife's younger sister Kylie Jenner, who appeared on the run way looking fresh-faced in comparison to her usual made up look.

Kanye claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of 'solutions based clothing,' saying, 'I don't want the clothes to be the life, I want the clothes to help the life.' 

It is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans.  

And the show certainly wasn't without support from a whole host of his famous friends. From Beyonce and Jay Z to P Diddy. 

Beyonce praised the collection  saying: 'I thought it was beautiful. Very innovative. I loved how the ladies lined up.'

She was referring to the army like line-up of models which Kanye has revealed was inspired by the 2011 London Riots which were going on when he started designing the collection. 

It was this inspiration that Style.com believed helped the designs, they said: 'It was that suggestion of conflict that gave some spine to this collaboration with Adidas: a protective toughness, a body-conscious severity that made the clothes more than a simple accessory to the footwear that was the predictable focus of the whole event.'

The footwear they reference is the Yeezy Boosts - which Kanye himself wore for the presentation.

Kanye wasn't alone in creating his show taking advice and inspiration from artist Vanessa Beecroft on staging.

He told ID of working with her: 'Me and Vanessa and her husband Federico just kept bouncing ideas. 

'She really pushed and drove it to be something that was her absolute communication against the idea of bags that you could buy at the adidas store.' 

ID further praised Kanye for his latest attempt at fashion. They said: 'He's certainly trying. Kanye's earnest commitment to fashion saw its fullest expression to date in this show, which blended artistic elements in an interesting way.' 

For lest we not forget Mr West's previous fashion work has never earnt him the acclaim he so desperately seems to desire. 

When he released a womens-wear collection in Paris it was widely slated.The Daily Telegraph said Kanye should, 'Stick to the day job.' 

The Wall Street Journal bemoaned Kanye's designs, criticising the models over-sized shoes and likening his attempts at design to when Lindsay Lohan did a line for Ungaro - which was a resounding flop.

Then when in 2013 he released a capsule collection with APC the Guardian questioned, 'Kanye West's APC collection: The new boring?' 

So to win praise is certainly a step forward for Kanye although it remains to be seen whether his clothes will be as popular with the public as they are with the editors.   

Famous friends: The show was attended by the likes of Beyonce and Anna Wintour, however, Kanye's daughter North had to be carried out after throwing a tantrum
