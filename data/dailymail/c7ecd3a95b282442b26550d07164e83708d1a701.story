Taxpayer-funded electric-car subsidies worth £5,000 per vehicle are still failing to spark real interest from drivers in ‘green’ motoring, a new report says today.

Only 1 per cent of UK drivers currently own an alternative fuel vehicle (AFV), it says.

And ‘green’ concerns such as low CO2 emissions are at the bottom of the checklist when Britons are shopping for a new car, says the poll of more than 3,000 motorists by Auto Trader.

Unpopular alternative: Only 1 per cent of UK drivers has an alternative fuel vehicle such as the electric Nissan LEAF

Subsidy: More than a third of drivers were unaware of the £5,000 Government subsidy for new electric cars

Since January 2011, motorists have been eligible for a £5,000 Government-backed subsidy on the full purchase price of a new electric vehicle, such as a Nissan LEAF, a BMW i3 or a Vauxhall Ampera.

But the Auto Trader survey showed that 35 per cent of drivers were unaware of this grant.

While 32 per cent of 17 to 24-year-olds said they were likely to buy an AFV, only 18 per cent of those aged 65 or over were likely to.

The survey also showed that while 62 per cent of women said they cared deeply about the impact their cars had on the environment, only 39 per cent of men did.

The poll also found that 79 per cent of motorists believe the Government should be doing more to make ‘green’ cars more affordable

None near me: 80 per cent of drivers surveyed said there was not a charging point near them, such as the one being used by this BMW i3

Some 89 per cent would like their vehicle to be more environmentally friendly - but only if it did not cost any extra.

When it comes to powering electric cars, 80 per cent say they have not seen a charging point within five miles of their home and 73 per cent want more charging points.

And 73 per cent said national TV campaigns would help spread the word about alternative-power  vehicles, while 52 per cent said they should be a compulsory section in the driving theory test.

Auto Trader group marketing director Jonathan Williams said: 'The good news for car manufacturers is British motorists are taking an interest in electric vehicles - when made aware of the benefits and cost savings. However, we're still a long way from convincing motorists to make the switch.

'Put simply, going green is not currently an attractive package. UK motorists are being asked to make huge compromises on aesthetics and the investment of their time finding and charging their vehicle.

'It's no wonder why, on top of all of these factors, a higher upfront purchase price is too much of an ask.

’Despite a £400million investment and a further £500million on its way in 2015 from the Government, motorists are still lacking information on costs, efficiency and effectiveness of owning electric vehicles - and, simply, choice.

'Clearly not enough is being done to incentivise both manufacturers and consumers.’
