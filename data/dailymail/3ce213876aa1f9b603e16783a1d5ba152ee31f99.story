It may not be long before we see his arms wiggling in celebration again. Daniel Sturridge is on the cusp of a return for Liverpool. Usually that means goals.

Brendan Rodgers is understandably thrilled about the return from injury of his 25-year-old striker, who has travelled to London with the squad for Tuesday night’s Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

The Liverpool manager is yet to reveal whether Sturridge is fit enough for a place on the bench, but if selected in the squad expect him to play some part. Either way, the match against West Ham on Saturday will definitely see his presence, Rodgers has said.

It is difficult to underestimate the impact he might have – even after nearly five months out with thigh and calf injuries. This, after all, is a player whose goals earned Liverpool more points last season than the strikes of Luis Suarez.

Sturridge scored 21 times in the Premier League to secure his team 20 points. Suarez found the net on 31 occasions to directly gain 16 points. Those two stand top of last season’s table highlighting that measurement.

Romelu Lukaku’s 15 Everton goals affected 12 points, Olivier Giroud’s 16 goals did likewise for Arsenal, while Eden Hazard scored 14 times to win Chelsea 10 points.

It really was a phenomenal contribution by Sturridge. Even this season, his solitary goal earned victory against Southampton: two extra points.

Liverpool fans are excited, certainly, but also a little anxious. We have had false dawns before with Sturridge, who was in training on Sunday. He has not appeared for his club since August 31 in the 3-0 win at Tottenham.

Roy Hodgson played him for 89 minutes of England’s friendly win over Norway three days later then had him in the training session which saw Sturridge suffer a thigh strain originally expected to keep him out for three weeks.

Rodgers and Hodgson traded words over the circumstances of that training session and Sturridge’s problems but whatever the root cause, he is only now ready to make a come back – and not before time.

Since he was initially ruled out Liverpool have stuttered, Rodgers has come under greater scrutiny than before, and Steven Gerrard has announced his departure from the club.

Liverpool’s Champions League campaign was utterly underwhelming and the lethargic style of play, coming after last season’s swashbuckling approach, drew serious concern.

Liverpool’s season has shown flickers of life recently, though. Unbeaten in 10 matches since defeat at Manchester United, Tuesday night’s match at Stamford Bridge could provide a platform for the first silverware of the season. Sturridge’s return may even provide a psychological lift from the sidelines.

In the table, Liverpool are five points adrift of the Champions League places, remarkable given their look of desperation at stages and largely down to lacklustre performances by teams above. Could Sturridge provide the kickstart to ensure this season ends with a positive charge?

Liverpool earned an average of 2.2 points a game with Sturridge playing last season, but only 1.7 points without him in the side

The statistics suggest so. In the 32 Premier League games Sturridge has played since the start of last season, Liverpool have won 68.80 per cent, averaging 2.2 points per game, losing just four. In the same period Liverpool have won just 50 per cent of their 28 games without Sturridge, averaging 1.7 points per game and losing nine times.

When Sturridge plays Liverpool score considerably more – 2.6 goals per game compared to 1.8 without him. Clearly, this data is boosted by the Uruguayan who headed to Barcelona last summer, but Sturridge more than played his part and will add a clinical element to Liverpool’s game. Too often, with Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert faltering, this has been lacking.

Raheem Sterling shouldered that responsibility before and since his mid-season break – and while his centre-forward role is an interesting development (realised fully in that moment he tore Chelsea’s defence apart to score at Anfield) you sense a deeper position would prove more damaging to opponents.

With Suarez gone, Sturridge injured, and Gerrard heading into the Los Angeles sunset, Sterling has been a lightening rod for Liverpool’s expectations. That is some responsibility.

Sturridge returning should remove some of that mental pressure and also allow the 20-year-old to operate in his natural place on the pitch. Imagine Sterling picking up the ball consistently from advanced midfield and running at defenders – as he did when dropping deep in the first leg of this semi-final.

Sterling and Sturridge are on the same wavelength, quick feet and quick brains, and goals should flow. A new SAS in the making? With a fight on four fronts still, Rodgers will hope so.
