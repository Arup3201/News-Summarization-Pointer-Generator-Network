There is a plateau in central France where visitors are few and winters cold and long-lasting. South-west of Lyon, it rises steeply amid pine forests to a bleak and windswept plain, with only a few hamlets and widely scattered farm houses as habitation.

In the midst of it is the village of Le Chambon. Until France fell in summer 1940, and Le Chambon became part of unoccupied Vichy France, you would hardly have known there was a war on. Then the refugees started to arrive.

They were wanted by the Germans for various reasons as resisters, communists or Jews. Many were Jewish children who had escaped the round-ups that ended up in their arrested parents taking the fatal train journey to the death camps in the East. 

Secret lives: Jewish and Christian children of one of Le Chambon's children's homes during World War II

A network of relief organisations was formed whose priority was to save them. Increasingly they sent them to Le Chambon, where they would be billeted in houses or on isolated farms.

The people of the plateau for the most part were staunchly Protestant. They had Huguenot traditions of defying persecution. They were also close-mouthed and averse to gossip.

The effect of their austere silent lifestyle frustrated the Vichy authorities when they decided to raid the plateau looking for Jews.

Some 50 police and gendarmes from the Departement Haute-Loire were sent up in trucks and ordered the mayor and the leading Pastor, Andre Trocme, to hand over the names of all Jews in the area.

They refused.

Trocme, a charismatic preacher with a very large following, said he had no idea if any of his parishioners were Jewish and he would not tell them if they were.

He was ordered to instruct the Jews to come forward. Instead he told them to disappear. Next morning in church  he told his flock they should ‘Obey God rather than man’.  The police had their own list of 72 Jews and proceeded to search the village, combing cellars and attics.

They found nobody.

So they set out to search the countryside. Again they found nothing but empty rooms. ‘Can’t think where they’ve gone,’ said one pastor in charge of a hostel. ‘They were here yesterday.’

‘Yesterday’ he had taken them all to the forests. This game of hide and seek went on for  three weeks.

At night the children were hidden in remote farmhouses in attics, behind wood piles or in cupboards whenever the gendarmes came.

One farmer asked them: ‘What do Jews look like? I hear they have big noses.’

A list of addresses was mysteriously pinned up in Le Chambon. It was of places which the police planned to visit. They also helpfully spent their spare time in the cafes talking loudly about where they planned to go next.

One Englishwoman in the village, Miss Gladys Maber, a Christian socialist from Portsmouth, ran a home for school children.

Asked by a police lieutenant if she knew of any Jews in the area, she demanded why he wanted to know. He said if she signed a declaration that there were none, the police would probably be withdrawn. She signed. The lieutenant sat at her piano and played God Save The King, and told her he would be back ‘with champagne’ when the British won the war.

After three weeks, only one Jew had been found, an Austrian who was carried off weeping, but he was soon returned as ‘insufficiently Jewish’. All other Jews on the list had vanished.

The prefect of the Departement, Robert Bach, reported to Vichy that the police had failed to find any Jews on the plateau.

They had probably fled because it was too cold to survive in the forests.

It seems probable that Bach had allowed advance warning of the search to be given. 

Invasion: Nazi occupied France as portrayed during the filming of 'Charlotte Gray'

Caroline Moorehead is not the first to have written of this remarkable safe enclave, but she has investigated the most thoroughly, tracking down survivors among the protectors and among the children.

She tells their individual stories in copious detail and they are by no means all sweetness and light.

Many survivors, especially orphaned children, were permanently scarred by their ordeal. The most remarkable thing about this rescue of perhaps 800 Jewish children — plus some 3,000 who passed through Le Chambon en route to safety across the Swiss border — was the scale of the cover-up. France has a notorious record for collaboration and denunciation during the German occupation. There was no shortage of informers in Paris or other cities. Yet on the plateau nobody peached. Even the local German army commander was said to have thrown anonymous letters of denunciation into the wastepaper basket.

Imprisonment and torture: Adolf Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, tortured the villagers to tray and get information

Proportionate to population, more Jews were saved on the plateau centred on Le Chambon than anywhere else in France.

But some rescuers paid a high price. Several women organisers who rescued Jewish children ended up in Ravensbruck concentration camp.

The popular and reckless local GP, Dr Roger Le Forestier, was murdered by the Germans, while Marianne Cohn, who conducted parties of children to the Swiss border by night, was caught 200 yards short of it and handed over to the Germans.

She was imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo trying to get information on her colleagues.

Then she was taken with other Resistance prisoners to an isolated spot where they were battered to death with spades.

Marianne left behind the most haunting poem written about Vichy France. It read:

I shall betray tomorrow,  not today.

Today, pull out  my fingernails,

I shall not betray.

The file is under  the window.

The file is not for  the window bars

It is for my wrists.

I shall betray tomorrow.

Today I have nothing to say.

Full of unpleasant and gritty details of life in France under the Germans, this is an inspiring book.
