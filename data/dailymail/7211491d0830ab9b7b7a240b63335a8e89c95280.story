To many, William Thomas is a loving father-of-four and a cheery face around the neighborhood.

But to police, the 42-year-old was allegedly leading a double life running a string of Manhattan brothels supplying busty Asian women.

Thomas, a former IT company expert, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of running four brothels from the Financial District to the Upper East Side.

The pimp next door? Brooklyn stroller dad of four Will Thomas lived a double life as a doting father and the alleged mastermind behind Manhattan brothels. William Thomas, 42, of Fort Greene, brazenly flaunted his stable of Asian hookers online

Family misfortunes: The son of a man accused of running a string of brothels across Manhattan tweets his reaction to the news

Making his thoughts known: The 11th-grader appears shocked that the story of his father's arrest had emerged, but his final remark suggest he previously knew something of the allegations

His own son appeared shocked by news 
of his arrest, taking to Twitter yesterday to make the apparently 
sarcastic comment: 'Awesome dad! way to make the thomas family proud.'

The 11th-grader added: 'My dad is the upcoming story on nbc news if anyone wants to watch...

'Pretty
surreal to hear your dad’s name on the news in connection to a massive 
prostitution ring bust. had to happen eventually i guess.'

His last comment suggests he already knew something about the allegations or the arrest.

Neighbors
said Thomas had been living quietly in an apartment in Fort Greene with
his one-year-old son, the boy's mother and his three-year-old daughter 
from a previous marriage.

'There was nothing suspicious or anything,' one neighbor told the New York Post.

Another resident said he 'is a nice guy, very friendly, always says hello.'

He appeared to fulfill his parental 
responsibility seamlessly, which included taking his 11th-grade son to a
Brooklyn Nets game on Friday, where the teenager tweeted his excitement
at having front-row seats.

Meanwhile,
police claim Thomas had created two sleazy websites to promote his 
hooker business, which charged between $200 to $300 an hour for sex.

These
were overseen in four brothels on Maiden Lane, Sixth Avenue near 37th 
Street, East 50th Street and East 58th Street, authorities allege.

Websites E4AKorea.com and E4ANY.com have now been taken down but advertised for the 'authentic girlfriend experience'

A source said Thomas married his second wife, half-Korean beauty So Young, who apparently had the connections he needed for his business venture.

They had a daughter, now three, but divorced in March, a source told the New York Post.

Thomas was arrested and charged with 
promoting prostitution after an undercover cop posed as a customer who 
wanted to have sex with an Asian woman.

He connected with Thomas on websites 
www.E4AKorea.com and www.E4ANYC.com. The 42-year-old was arrested on 
October 11 and posted $10,000 bail two days later.

On the websites, which have since been taken down, pictures of half-naked Asian women promising 'Your Midtown Korean experience' and the 'girlfriend experience' for up to $300 an hour were advertised.

'GFE's do multipop on an hour rate basis,' the websites detail, indicating the hooker would have sex multiple times.

The undercover officer kept in touch 
with Thomas by email and text and 'became a member of the E4AKorea 
private men’s club', prosecutors said in court.

He then went to one of the brothels and met a Korean woman who 
introduced herself as 'Olivia' and told him he could kiss her but had to
wear a condom during sex.

The 
complaint said: 'The undercover officer asked for a 
Japanese girl, and [Rei Spain] said the Japanese girls don’t do full 
service, only massage and "happy ending" for $100 plus $40 tip.'

Two
women, Jung Lee, 28, of Queens, and Rei Spain, 38, of Long Island, were
also arrested for prostitution and promoting prostitution.

Lee is being held at Riker's Island and Spain was released without bail

Thomas’
services also included overseas travel, but this probe only targeted 
Manhattan operations, according to the Manhattan DA.
