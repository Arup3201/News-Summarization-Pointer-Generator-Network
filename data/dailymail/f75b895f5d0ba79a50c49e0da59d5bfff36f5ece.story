The family of a Dallas woman found dead two days after she tried to call 911 during a deadly attack filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city and local police today.

Deanna Cook called 911 on August 17 to report that her ex-husband was assaulting her. Police have acknowledged the call was not logged correctly so the responding officers did not know it was an emergency.

The two officers who went to Cook's south Dallas home received no response at the door and left without entering, police said.

Cook was found dead in her bathtub on August 19 after Cook's relatives forced their way into the home. The ex-husband, Delvecchio Patrick, is charged with murder.

According to dallasnews.com, she can be heard screaming: 'Delvecchio, why are you doing this?'

Later she said: 'Red, please stop, I didn’t do anything to you.' The name Red is reportedly her husband's nickname.

Police fired one call taker who told 
worried family members searching for Cook on August 19 to call the jail 
and local hospitals first.

The call taker who received Cook's 
original call was suspended for 10 days. Police say they have also made 
changes to how calls are logged and announced they are hiring more call 
takers.

The federal lawsuit alleges police were late responding to the call and relied on officers who didn't properly investigate.

It accuses the city of violating Cook's due process and equal protection rights by failing to implement necessary policies.

Cook's family said on Wednesday that 
police have refused to let them hear the tape of Cook's call. Police 
have also declined to release a transcript.

However, the lawsuit says Cook was 
screaming and begging for help during the call, and Chief David Brown 
has said the attack on Cook can be heard in the background.

It was 50 minutes before officers arrived at Cook's home, according to the lawsuit.

Attorney Nick Pittman said the 
officers stopped twice on the way — for a burglary call and a personal 
trip to 7-Eleven. He said the officers acknowledged the 7-Eleven stop in
internal interview reports he reviewed.

Pittman described authorities' response last month as a 'comedy of errors'.

'They have long had a policy of not taking the 911 call center seriously,' Pittman said.

Dallas police declined to comment today. A spokesman for the city did not return a message.

Family members also said they felt police shortchanged Cook because she was black and lived in south Dallas.

'I would like for it to be understood
how Dallas Police Department responds to certain victims, no matter 
what the crime is,' said Valecia Battle, one of Cook's sisters. 'I think
it needs to be understood that it does play a role what your class is. 
Your gender does play a role. Your race does play a role.'

Battle, another sister, Karletha 
Cook-Gundy, and their mother, Vickie Cook, said they wanted to see 
domestic violence taken more seriously.

Patrick had been arrested multiple 
times for allegedly attacking Cook. Cook filed for divorce last year, 
and the divorce was finalized in January.

He remains jailed in Dallas County, 
with bond set at $500,000. His attorney, Roger Lenox, did not 
immediately return a phone message.

Family members said Patrick continued to harass Cook in recent months.

'I just wish and I pray that it 
becomes urgent and that nobody should find any individual behind 
domestic violence dead,' Vickie Cook said in an interview.

The family's lawsuit calls for unspecified damages. No court date has been scheduled yet.

Brown, in an earlier interview with 
Dallas television station KDFW, said Patrick's assault on Cook that 
'obviously led to her death' is clearly audible on the tape. He met with
family members after the incident.

The call 'should have been escalated 
to the highest priority — lights and sirens — and that did not happen, 
and so we're trying to find out what breakdown in communication happened
along the way between the 911 clerk, dispatcher and the officers that 
didn't allow that to happen,' Brown told the television station.
