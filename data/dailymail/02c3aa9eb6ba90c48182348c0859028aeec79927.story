A teenager discovered she had cancer after rupturing a tumour while performing an emergency stop during her driving test. 

Nicole Walker thought she was just nervous when she began experiencing abdominal pains at the beginning of her test when she was 17. 

But within an hour, the now 21-year-old was being rushed to hospital in Glasgow, where she learned she  in fact had  ovarian cancer. 

Nicole Walker thought she was suffering from nerves when she prepared to sit her driving test with a store stomach. The then teenager was shocked when she later learned she had ovarian cancer

Miss Walker, who now travels the country raising awareness for teenage cancer, said: 'When I got into the test car I was having quite sore abdominal pains, but I thought it was just anxiety. 

'By the time I had finished an hour later I could barely walk. I went straight to the GP who sent me to the hospital,' she told the Sunday Mirror. 

Now Miss Walker is campaigning to raise teenage cancer awareness 

There, doctors revealed she had a large tumour inside her that had ruptured with the force of an emergency stop performed during the test.  

Three months of chemotherapy followed, on the first day of which the student passed the test after sitting it for the second time.  

After shaving her head and quitting her sixth form studies, Miss Walker began touring UK schools to raise awareness of the condition among teenagers.

She is particularly concerned with spotting the signs early enough to receive proper treatment as doctors failed to spot her condition from the age of 14 when she was diagnosed with stress and a stomach bug after complaining of abdominal pain.

'I don't blame the GP as teenage cancers can be hard to detect,' she said. 

'But I want other doctors to read my story and look out for the warning signs.

'I was presenting with all the symptoms: stomach pain, feeling sick but it was only a week before my test when a lump appeared in my abdomen that he referred me to the hospital. 

'I was waiting for the appointment when the tumour ruptured.'

Every year an estimated 2,500 young people are diagnosed with the disease.
