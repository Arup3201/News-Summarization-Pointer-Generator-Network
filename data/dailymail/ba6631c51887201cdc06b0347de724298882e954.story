This is the heart-stopping moment a skier triggers an avalanche and leaves a wall of snow tumbling after him.

GoPro footage shows Ritchie Nagle skiing down a smooth off-piste slope in Banff, Alberta, before encountering a patch of rough ground.

Immediately, as he clips some of the packed ice below, the whole mountainside starts giving way.

Nagle is forced to ride the snowy wave out. 

Miraculously he escapes the freezing tide unscathed.

In the video - shot on Sunday - Nagle's friend is seen waiting for him in a safe location. 

He had skied the mountain just moments before with no problem. 

Nagle said that it was a struggle staying upright as he skied over 'block-shaped chunks' of snow.

Eventually, thanks to his skill, he made it to smoother terrain.

'Hopefully I don't have to do that again... I was very lucky,' he added.

The skiing enthusiast says he is trained in how to deal with avalanches and always carries safety gear on him.

To date the video of him in action has been watched more than 45,000 times. At the end of the clip he turns around to see the scene of the destruction behind him.

Many viewers have applauded Nagle's ability. Avalanches can reach speeds of 80 mph within about five seconds, according to National Geographic. 

Each year, they kill more than 150 people worldwide.
