Life coach Iyanla Vanzant called out a man with 34 children - asking if he used birth control and ever considered getting a vasectomy - on her television show.

Part of Vanzant's conversation with Jay Williams was revealed in a YouTube clip of 'Iyanla: Fix My Life' for OWN TV's YouTube channel.  

In the video, Williams holds dolls standing in for his children in his lap, with a pile of them lying behind him, The Huffington Post pointed out. Vanzant sits across from him on a porch. 

There are 17 mothers in total and and his children range in age from 3 to 26, the news site reported. 

'So let me ask you this question, Jay,' she says in the clip. '34 children. At any point, did it dawn on you this is too much?'

Confrontation: Iyanla Vanzant asked Jay Williams - who has 34 children - about a possible vasectomy. Williams told Vanzant he didn't want to undergo the procedure and 'I don't have a problem with what I've created'

'No,' Williams says.

'So a child at 15, you never said "Let me use a condom?"' Vanzant asks.

Williams replies 'I did use condoms.'

Shocked, Vanzant leans in and asks 'How many?'

'I probably would have had 200 kids if I didn't use condoms,' Williams admits.

'Really?' Vanzant asks, with Williams nodding. 'Did it ever dawn on you, "Let me get a vasectomy?"'

Williams says 'No,' and when pressed, simply says 'I don't want one.'

Gesturing toward the dolls, Vanzant insists 'But look what you've created!'

Williams, holding the pile of dolls, says 'I don't have a problem with what I've created.'

Vanzant points out that the stoned-faced Williams is holding them in a way that would hurt actual children.

She asks, 'What can you do right now, holding these 14 babies? With all of them behind you that you don't even have your hand on?

Father: Jay Williams claimed to use birth control, and said 'I probably would have had 200 kids if I didn't use condoms'

'What can you, one man, do right now?' she continues. 'Tell me, for these children, what can you do?'

When Williams plunks the dolls down in a chair next to him, Vanzant asks 'Are you aware that you just thonked that baby's head on the chair?' 

She also points out a second doll is lying face-down on the ground. 

Vanzant goes on to grill Williams, who says he is 'tired of holding the dolls.'

'Okay, wait a minute,' Vanzant says, then starts to put the dolls his arms.

'I'm sorry, as a mom,' she continues, 'I don't get not to take care of my children, no matter what I'm thinking or feeling or going on.

'I had to figure out and find the time and the way to get myself handled, but, they were first,' she continues. 'And I didn't get to just put them down because it was inconvenient.'
