A man who weighed a whopping 800lbs when he was just 16 years old has shed almost 600lbs over the space of a decade; almost 75per cent of his body weight.

Justin Willoughby, now 27, based in Bradford, Pennsylvania, lost the weight without any assistance, drugs or surgery; simply by eating smaller, healthier meals and by very gradually building up an exercise routine, he tells Samantha Guthrie on the Today show.

'My first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down,' he explained. 'That was very painful. My back started hurting, my legs started hurting. That was a workout for me.'

Unrecognizable: Justin Willoughby weighed 800lbs by the time he was 16 (left) and was told he would die if he didn't shape up, so he gradually managed to lose almost 600lbs over the space a decade (right, now, at 235lbs)

Mr Willoughby says he struggled with stress and 'severe anxiety,' as a teen and turned to food as a source of comfort.

'I was starting to get addicted to food. I loved food. If I could do anything, I’d marry food. I loved it that much,' he admits.

His breaking point came when, at the age of only 16, his doctors informed him he would die if he didn't lose weight, according to an account he wrote for The Huffington Post.

'I just knew that I had to focus on the day I was living. I had a “lose weight or die trying” mentality,' he wrote.

Then and now: Back when he was obese (left), Mr Willoughby (also right) says he was 'addicted to food,' because it eased his chronic anxiety, but eventually snapped and adopted a 'lose weight or die trying mentality'

Total turnaround: 'My first exercise was just standing up and sitting back down,' he recalls, which was 'very painful,' but he built strength over time and now exercises and lifts weights for 90 minutes a day

After Mr Willoughby had mastered standing for a couple of minutes at a time, then taking more steps each day, he achieved a one mile walk, which took him 33 days to complete.

Then, he joined his local YMCA - Mr Willoughby says his 'belief in God' played a 'significant' part in his transformation - and started walking for up to an hour, five or six days a week. Eventually, he was running 5k's.

After reading up on portion control on the internet, he turned his eating habits around too: 'I went from eating white breads, processed meats, and other high-fat, high-sugar foods to more natural foods, like egg whites, whole-grain breads, whole-grain cereals, milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables.'

Won't be needing those anymore: Mr Willoughby (right) is now a passionate healthy-living coach, motivational speaker, and author

On Jan 1 of this year, Mr Willoughby, who has undergone skin-reduction surgery, gave up 'sweet junk food,' as well.

His weight loss has been gradual, but consistent. At his lowest, he weighed 207lbs, but he has since taken up weightlifting to build lean muscle mass, and now weighs 235lbs - working out for about 90 minutes every day.

These days, there doesn't appear to be a trace of the anxious, unhappy teenage boy he left behind. Mr Willoughby is now a passionate healthy-living coach, motivational speaker, and author, whose latest eBook is entitled Overcoming The Monday Mentality.
