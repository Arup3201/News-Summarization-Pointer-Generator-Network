A woman watched helplessly as her husband was crushed by a teenager who fell 80ft from a  shopping centre balcony.

The 47-year-old was walking with his wife in Westfield Stratford City when he was hit by the ‘stocky’ 18-year-old, witnesses said.

There were reports the teenager had been dangling over the balcony before plummeting two floors.

Dozens of police and security guards cleared the area ‘within minutes’. Despite the massive force of the impact, both men – whose names have not yet been released – survived and were taken to hospital, where their condition last night was described as stable.

The drama unfolded outside the Party Fiesta store in the East London mall on Thursday afternoon.

The teenager, from nearby Newham, was spotted on the balcony by shop staff as the other man, from Great Dunmow in Essex, walked below.

Lucian Cosme, 29, an assistant at the iPlayNTalk mobile phone shop, said: ‘We could see the man holding onto the barrier and his body was dangling over the side.

‘I saw him for a second and then he fell. I heard a loud noise, like an explosion.

‘He was lying on the ground, his jeans were ripped from the impact and he had fallen onto a white man who had his wife with him. She was obviously really scared and was crying. He definitely jumped.’

Incident: Police were called to the scene after stunned shoppers saw the man fall from the upper floor and land on the pedestrian at about 3.30pm yesterday

A shop assistant at Party Fiesta said: ‘I heard a loud crash like a car crash.  Everybody started screaming and shouting. I went outside and saw a big black guy, he had fallen and hit a man.

‘The white man was moving but the black man was totally unconscious. The man who was hit was with his wife. She was really upset, crying and shaken up.’

The shop assistant said a doctor who was shopping with his baby rushed to help. He said: ‘The man who was hit was obviously in a lot of pain and was touching his shoulder. The other man was around 6ft, and he was broad and stocky. If you get hit by him it is going to really hurt.

‘The doctor rushed over and helped to treat the men while he still had his baby in one hand. It was lucky for both of them he was walking past.’

Investigation: Police have said inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident

The two men were taken to Royal London Hospital to be treated for their injuries

Lara Ferrer, 32, who works at the David and Goliath clothes shop, said: ‘I heard a loud noise and looked out. I saw a black man lying totally still. The last thing I saw, he was being stretchered off.

‘He was in a neck brace and had fastenings on his body to stop him moving.’

After the men were taken to The Royal London Hospital, officers cordoned off the area.

A police spokesman said yesterday the men had not suffered life-threatening injuries.
