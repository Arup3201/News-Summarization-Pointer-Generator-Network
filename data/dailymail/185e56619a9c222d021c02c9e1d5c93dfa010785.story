Brazil’s new general co-ordinator Gilmar Rinaldi has criticised the nation’s World Cup squad for paying such a public tribute to the injured Neymar before their semi-final contest against Germany last month.

Rinaldi claims the Brazilian squad should have been far more focused on the task of beating Germany and ‘killed’ Neymar’s replacement Bernard’s chances of performing.

Neymar was the poster boy of the home World Cup for Brazil as the host nation managed to reach the semi-finals but he sustained a serious back injury during the quarter-final victory over Colombia.

#ForcaNeymar: Rinaldi has heavily criticised the caps worn by the Brazil squad at the World Cup for Neymar

The news evidently rocked the squad and left the nation devastated as they prepared to take on Germany for a place in the final.

In the pre-match build up to the clash with the Germans, many of the squad wore caps with a Twitter hashtag 'ForcaNeymar' of support for their star team mate.

Bernard was chosen to fill in for the Barcelona forward against Joachim Low's men and Rinaldi is adamant that had an adverse effect on Neymar’s stand-in.

However Bernard (pictured above) wore the hat supporting Neymar himself in the lead up to the match.

Also, It's clear the squad was united and felt Neymar's disappointment that he would miss out on a home World Cup semi-final. 

Rinaldi is now part of Brazil’s new management along with returning coach Dunga, following Luiz Felipe Scolari’s resignation after the World Cup hosts were completely humiliated during a 7-1 thrashing by the Germans.

‘Brazil were missing our best player, we were experiencing a difficult time and we were about to face Germany - our most difficult game to date in that World Cup ... I would not have agreed to an action like those hats,’ he told SporTV.

‘What must Bernard have thought going in for him? How must he have felt? It's like saying: 'It's your turn, you will win the game for us.' The game was already difficult enough.

‘It was a cute homage and Neymar is a wonderful lad against whom I have nothing but giving Neymar strength at that time was wrong. It should have been about the collective.

‘On a matchday, we needed warriors to be focused. That's not why we lost, but the spirit needed wasn't there. The hats killed Bernard.’
