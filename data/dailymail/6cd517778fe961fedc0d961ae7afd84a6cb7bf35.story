The ex-drummer of alt-rock band Cake has been sentenced to at least 15 years in prison for sexually molesting a three-year-old girl.

Peter Ivan McNeal, 48, appeared at a Los Angeles court on Tuesday where he was ordered to spend 15 years to life in prison.

McNeal was found guilty in March 2013 of one count of oral copulation of a child 10 years old or younger, the Los Angeles County Attorney's Office said.

The musician molested the girl on Thanksgiving in 2009 at a home where he was a guest in the Hollywood Hills area, the statement said.

He was sentenced on Tuesday by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who ordered the 48-year-old to register as a sex offender.

Cake, formed in California in 1991, has hits including The Distance. McNeal joined the band in 2001 and remained for several years. 

He also worked with artists Mike Doughty and Brett Dennen, as well as gaining a recording credit on Norah Jones’ 2009 album The Fall.
