Xabi Alonso is a midfield maestro. In what has been a stellar career, his highlights include unforgettable Champions League wins with Liverpool and Real Madrid and helping Spain conquer the world. 

He is now aiming to make history with Bayern Munich and, in his first interview with an English newspaper since moving to Germany, he outlined his ambitions to Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher.

Here are the 10 best quotes from that brilliant interview.

On leaving Real Madrid: No. I only had this option. There were times I heard some English clubs said 'what would he think' but my idea was to stay in Madrid. Then when I heard of Munich’s interest I said: 'Xabi, think what you want and where you will be happy'. I needed a fresh start somewhere. This might be my last experience in football. 

I came from my hometown team, Real Sociedad, to the best team in England (smiles); to the best team in Spain to the best team in Germany. I would say it is a beautiful career. I wanted a nice football script. I cannot be a one club man like you! 

On seeing Liverpool draw Real Madrid in the Champions League: (puts hands over face) Oh my gosh! I was actually in the middle of doing my medical here. I came out from the scan and saw it… 

On English teams struggling defensively in Europe: To be fighting at European level, you need players who know how to play in the big games. At this moment, Spanish and German teams have that. English teams have changed so much. Only now do Chelsea look solid. Liverpool did very well last year but this season they are struggling. It takes time. City have won the league twice in three years but they cannot find that mentality in Europe. That makes things difficult.

On importance of adaptability: Each team I see (that is successful) has to be comfortable playing three systems. They need to adapt to each game, depending on the circumstances. It is not about not being loyal to your identity. No, no, no. It is about knowing your strengths and showing your players what you need to do each game to prepare in the right way. 

In Liverpool, you know what it was like: we had a plan for each team. Every game is totally different. Let me give you an example. This season we have played with three defenders, sometimes four, sometimes five. You need to be able to manage at least three or four systems. It has nothing to do with betraying your principles of football. 

On Cristiano Ronaldo being the best player in world: For sure. I said recently if Manuel Neuer or another German player won the Ballon d’Or, it would be fair as they won the World Cup. But if Ronaldo wins it again, it would also be fair for the season he had, winning the Champions League. He is the best player I have played. After you, of course!

On a lack of understanding rather than technique letting English players down: Yes, for sure. When I was in Liverpool, I was reading the programme before a match one day. There was an interview with a 12-year-old from the Academy. He was asked what his main strengths were. His answer? Shooting and tackling. I said to myself 'OK but I don’t think the main quality of player should be tackling'. It must be something else. 

On what type of player can play holding midfield: You need someone who thinks 'what is best: Attack? Defence?' You have to know when to take two or three steps to make space, then you know you will be able to pass to someone between the lines. Players don’t have to move. Pep says this always to Mario Goetze (jumps up and starts pointing). 'You – don’t run! Stay there! The ball will come to you. Don’t move!' He shows clips to the team of Goetze standing still for 10 seconds. Pep works so much about the positional game. It is not about running everywhere. It is about you staying there and the others have to work to get it to you. 

On Carragher's view that Spain would win nothing: I know! I remember! What did you say? (puts on fake Liverpool accent) 'Spain? Spain! Can’t run! Can’t run!' You got the gold medal for the loudest player I played with. I remember at West Brom, in 2009. We are winning 2-0, the game is won and (Alvaro) Arbeloa tries to run the ball out of defence. He loses the ball. Next thing I hear: (jumps up) 'Eh! Eh! You! Arbeloa! You’re not Maradona!'

On Spain's success: When Sergio (Ramos)is on top of his game mentally, he’s the best. In midfield we had (David) Silva, Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta, myself. Playing with so many midfielders was our strength. We didn’t have great players in one-against-one situations. It took a lot of short passes to create the last chance. Then, when we did, we had David Villa and Fernando Torres, who were on top form.  

On his future after retiring (and the possibility of becoming a pundit): A pundit (more laughter)! Probably I will take my badges. I have lots of things in my mind. With the managers I have worked for, I have learned a lot. But there is another side. You cannot take that step too quickly. That part takes time. Would I walk away from football? Sometimes you think you need that break but you need something else.
