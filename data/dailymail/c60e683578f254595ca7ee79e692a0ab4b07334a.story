The Spain squad have arrived in Seville ahead of their world cup warm-up match with Bolivia tomorrow night.

Vicente del Bosque's defending champions will be keen to show the world they are still the team to beat, despite some recent poor performances.

With the manager still not having named his final 23 - because of Diego Costa's lingering injury - it will be interesting to see which XI Del Bosque ends up picking, while players on the fringes will want to prove they are worthy of a place in the final squad.

Waiting game: Spain coach Vicente del Bosque will wait until the June 2 deadline to see if Diego Costa is fit

Speaking at a press conference earlier this week Del Bosque admitted he is still playing the waiting game over the Atletico Madrid striker's fitness.

'I'm not sure Costa will make it,' he said.

He said that he will wait until the June 2 deadline to give Costa a chance to be fit, but that he wants Costa to be 100 per cent if he is to get there.

Replacement? Fernando Torres could be the man to replace Costa if he doesn't get fit in time

'We've still got time but now it's in the hands of the doctors and the medical team. We have to be cautious,' he said.

Spain play another warm-up game against El Salvador in Maryland next week, before they face Holland, Chile and Australia in Group B.
