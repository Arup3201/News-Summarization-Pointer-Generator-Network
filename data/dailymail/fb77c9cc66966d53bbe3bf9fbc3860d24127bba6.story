Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell is a king among showbusiness promoters.

He takes few prisoners in his quest to dominate the world of entertainment, as the Royal Family was reminded this week.

The TV mogul was yesterday accused of hijacking Monday’s Royal Variety Performance centenary and turning it into an advert for his Britain’s Got  Talent show.

The performance – before the Queen and Prince Philip at the Royal Albert Hall – featured a glut of artists signed to Cowell’s Syco Music label and large sections of the programme were dominated by BGT judges and acts.

As well as this year’s winners Ashleigh and Pudsey, space was given to the show’s other successes including Paul Potts, dance troupe Diversity and comedy duo Stavros Flatley.

Writing on Twitter, one observer noted: ‘The entire line up is in some way affiliated with Simon Cowell.’

The show itself – which attracts a global TV audience of 150million – was presented by BGT judge David Walliams.

He even invoked Cowell in a joke, cheekily comparing him to the monarch.

BGT judge Amanda Holden, 41, also presented a ‘tribute’ to the ITV talent show.

Other acts linked to Cowell included boy-band One Direction, who signed to Syco Records after finishing third in X Factor.

Even Cheryl Cole - who performed with Girls Aloud – owes much of her success to her stint as an X Factor judge.

BGT first established a relationship with the Royal Variety Performance in 2007.

It was agreed the show’s winners should be allowed to perform for a royal audience.

In return, Britain’s Got Talent donates some of the money it raises from viewers’ telephone votes to the Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, which organises the performance.

A Syco spokesman said last night: ‘We had no input into which acts were chosen.'

Celebs: The show also had performances from Robbie Williams, Neil Diamond, Girls Aloud, One Direction, Rod Stewart, Kylie Minogue, Katherine Jenkins & Placido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli and Alicia Keys.
