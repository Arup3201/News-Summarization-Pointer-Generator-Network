Manchester United are in the potentially advantageous position of enjoying midweeks without the rigours of European football this season and were all fresh for training on Thursday.

Louis van Gaal’s side arrived at Carrington ready to take on Everton at Old Trafford on Sunday hoping to make amends for the defeat in the same fixture last season.

The problems they faced against the Toffees were symptomatic of David Moyes’ ill-fated reign at the club (and the second clash at Goodison was the Scot's final match in charge of United).

But now, after a tricky start under Van Gaal, United are ready to kick on.

Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney were among the stars snapped at the training ground’s gates on Thursday morning.

Daley Blind and Angel di Maria were also driving in ahead of Roberto Martinez’s side’s visit, while Marouane Fellaini – seemingly accompanied by his brother – was there too.

They will hope to be motoring on Sunday against an Everton side who will have flown back from Russia after playing Krasnodar on Thursday night.
