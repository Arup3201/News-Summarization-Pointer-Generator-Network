Waiting lists for designer handbags, clothes or even the latest must-have children's toy have become the norm.

And now beauty companies have joined their ranks by garnering huge waiting lists before their products have even hit the shops.

Lancome's DreamTone serum promising 'ground-breaking results' is the latest product to be in such high demand that it has accumulated a waiting list of 1,400 people before it is even released next week.

The cream is said to 'revolutionise' skin tone by reducing dark age spots by 66 per cent in just four weeks.

The £69 serum isn't officially released until August 15, but stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Naomi Campbell are believed to already have a bottle of the coveted beauty product, The Times reports.

The product is the result of seven years of research into the causes of hyperpigmentation.

The Forever Light Creator anti-aging serum by Yves Saint Laurent accumulated a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month

It is not the first time that a beauty product has become a success before its even been released.

The £125 anti-ageing cream Cult 51, which is said to contain the most expensive ingredients ever, had more than 5,000 people on the waiting list when it was released last month.

Model Kelly Brook and singer Myleene Klass are believed to be fans of the night cream made by British chemist Richard Mears after being given pre-release samples.

In trials so far, Cult 51 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks. It is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days.

It increases the skin’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks.

Mr Mears said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘3D effects’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin.

He said: 'Most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things, so consumers end up buying several products, such as those aimed at day time use, nights, the eyes and skin brightening, to get the full benefits.

'Brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales. However, there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it, preventing it from functioning naturally.'

Yves Saint Laurent's Forever Light Creator range also totted up a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month.

A record-breaking 15,000 free sample vouchers for the £61 serum were also downloaded before it even hit the shops.

The company even set up a dedicated hotline for customers wanting to order the product as makers YSL attempted to keep up with demand.

Shoppers wanting to buy Max Factor's Lashfinity 72-hour mascara were subject to a three-week waiting list earlier this year.
