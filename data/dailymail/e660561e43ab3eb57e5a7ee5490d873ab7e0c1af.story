Two men seriously injured in a gas explosion yesterday have been arrested by detectives who believe the blast may have come from a 'Breaking Bad' style drugs lab.

The men, one aged 27 and the other in his 30s, were said to be in a 'serious' condition in hospital last night after being burnt when the blast ripped off the side of the house in Birmingham.

Both have been arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and West Midlands Police say the blast 'may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs'.

And this morning, one neighbour claimed the house is a well-known drugs den and was being used to 'cook' crystal methamphetamine - a highly addictive drug that is the focus of hit American TV show Breaking Bad.

Arrests: Police have arrested the men on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and West Midlands Police say the blast 'may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs'

Frightening: Residents reported hearing a noise 'like a bomb going off', before the front of the property was 'totally obliterated'

A plastic bag full of aerosol canisters was found among the debris inside the wrecked house this morning as police cordoned off the area

The neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Its well known in the area but nobody has been brave enough to report it to police.

'We've smelt cannabis coming from there before but I've been told they've expanded, shall we say.

'They were producing crystal meth because of the bigger profits and there's more of a demand for it these days.

Another resident, who also declined to be named, added: 'I was told they had started cooking crank (crystal methamphetamine) but I didn't believe it.

'But it looks like they should have stuck to what they knew best, they must have been amateurs.' 

The explosion happened just after 8pm - leaving the property in the West Heath area of the city in ruins. 

Crumbling wreck: The gas explosion has left parts of the building scattered across the surrounding gardens up to 40ft away

Devastation: The front of the house has been ripped open leaving fragments of building and household appliances littered around the premises

Residents reported hearing a noise 'like a bomb going off', before the front of the house was 'totally obliterated'.

Both men were inside the property at the time of the explosion and were taken to the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital with burns to their arms, head and back. 

A force spokesman said the arrested men were still in hospital this morning but their injuries are not described as life-threatening.

Detectives are to question the pair when they have recovered.

Meanwhile, the road remains closed while an investigation continues and the site of the explosion is made safe.

Chief Inspector Sean Russell, of West Midlands Police, moved to reassure the local community, saying it was 'an isolated explosion'.

Turning to the possible cause, he said: 'One line of inquiry is that it may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs.'

Parts of the building could be seen scattered across gardens up to 40ft away this morning, while neighbouring homes were said to have shook under the force of the blast.

Paramedics said a third man, who was in a neighbouring property at the time, was treated at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.

Tony Rice, 50, who lives opposite the damaged property, said: 'I just heard this massive boom and I went outside and a front door frame had smashed my van window.

'I live over 40 metres away from the property so that shows the force of the explosion. The front of the property is wide open, it has ripped the walls clean off.

Tremor: One shocked neighbour claimed the gas explosion shook her own house to its core while she watching the X-Factor

Another neighbour said: 'It was a noise like I had never heard. I can't describe it. It was terrifying' - above, a neighbour's garden with scattered debris from the explosion

'I think one of the blokes lived upstairs and the other downstairs. The man from downstairs had his skin ripped off. He was in a bad way.

'The upstairs tenant was walking around but was obviously in a lot of shock, which I think masked the pain he was in.

'The force of it shook the foundations of my home - it was an incredibly powerful explosion and the walls just shuddered.'

Another neighbour, Eileen Priest, 40, added: 'There was an almighty explosion and the house just shook to the core.

West Midlands Police said the circumstances surrounding the explosion had not yet been confirmed and an investigation would be launched

A force spokesman said the arrested men were still in hospital this morning but their injuries are not described as life-threatening

'My daughter said she actually saw a bloke running away from the scene in shorts.

'It was like a bomb going off and has obliterated the front of the property. I thought it was a car crash at first.

'We've had police, ambulance and fire all here, there were flashing blue lights everywhere. It is very shocking.'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, added: 'I was watching X-Factor when I heard this incredible bang and I looked outside and parts of the house were in my front garden.

'The blast had sent parts of the building just catapulting across the street - I could see door handles in the middle of the street.

'It was a noise like I had never heard, it left a ringing in my ears for a long time. I can't describe it. It was terrifying.'

A parked police car remained outside the home in the West Heath area of Birmingham this morning where an investigation is underway

The men, one aged in his 20s and the other in his 30s, are said to be in a 'serious' condition in hospital after the gas explosion tore apart the front of the property in the West Heath area of Birmingham just after 8pm

The sudden explosion last night ripped off the front of the two-storey house, including the front door and a window

West Midlands Police said yesterday: 'The full extent of the damage to the building and neighbouring properties is still being established.

'The cause of the explosion is not known but emergency gas crews are on their way to the scene.

'People in the area are being asked to return to their homes if safe to do so to give blue light services clear access.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: 'On arrival, crews found two men who had reportedly been inside the property at the time of the explosion, both of whom had suffered serious burns injuries.

'The first patient, a man in his 30s, was treated for burns to his arm, head and back.

Teams of emergency workers could be seen inspecting the house this evening to establish the cause of the explosion

Shaken neighbours described the sound of the blast as 'like a bomb going off' as debris was flung up to 40ft away

'The second patient, a man in his 20s, was treated for burns to his back, neck, hands and arms.

'Both patients were given pain relief on scene before being transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.

'A third patient from a nearby property was assessed on scene but did not require hospital treatment.

'The cause of the explosion is unknown.'

Police said Aldersmead Road and surrounding roads would remain closed until further notice.

Emergency crews cordoned off the street tonight following the explosion and an investigation got underway
