Police claim to have foiled an attempt by a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family to kidnap her children away from foster care and back to her home in country NSW.

Betty Colt, one of the notorious 'Colts', stands accused of hatching the 'runaway plan' to abduct the children removed from her after authorities found them living in squalor and exhibiting telltale signs of incest in the winter of 2012. Police alleged her son was given a secret phone and her mobile phone number to aid his getaway.

Betty (a pseudonym prescribed by the Children's Court) has been charged with recruiting her son Bobby, 16, to commit a criminal act.

Betty is accused of hatching a plan to kidnap her sons from foster carers

She is alleged to have orchestrated a brazen early morning rendezvous with two of her sons that would have seen them returned to her care, in contravention of strict court orders.

In Moss Vale local court on Tuesday, magistrate Mary Ryan heard how Betty smuggled two of her sons a mobile telephone and a charger - concealed inside jacket pockets - by delivering them in secret during fortnightly meetings in the presence of foster carers.

She also delivered them her phone number, using sticky tape to secure it to the back of an iPod, at a separate meeting, the court heard.

In an interview conducted with 15-year-old Billy Colt (Bobby's brother) late last year and tendered in evidence by police, Billy said his mother Betty secretly opened up a line of communication that allowed her to plan the 'runaway'.

'She hid the charger in my jacket,' Billy told the police in the interview.

'(Bobby) had the phone in his jacket, she hid it, she told him what it was...she planned a runaway with Bobby.

'Mum put the phone number on my iPod...under sticky tape.

'(She said) this is my number, give it to Bobby.'

The court heard allegations she snuck a mobile phone and charger as well as a copy of her telephone number to her sons during monitored visits, with instructions for their 'escape plan'

He told police the iPod - a Christmas present - had country music downloaded into it.

The explosive evidence took on a chilling note as Billy described to police how his brother told him about the plan behind closed doors and with 'soft voices' to avoid detection.

'(Bobby) said don't tell anyone because we might get catched.'

The alleged plan - which police claim to have foiled - was for Betty to pick up her children between 2am and 4am one morning in a four wheel drive parked 'halfway down the road' from their foster family.

She was then going to take them to another location where they would be whisked away by their cousin.

Appearing via audiovisual link after the police interview was played to the court, Billy said he didn't want to be part of the plan because he knew it would land him in trouble with police.

'(Betty) said get up in time and come with me, mum was suppose to pick us up.

'I don't want to get in trouble, we wasn't allowed to leave...Mum said she just wants her kid back.'

Under cross examination by Betty Colt's lawyer, Billy was asked 'who started the talk about going away.'

He replied: 'mum'.

The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse

Under the Crimes Act, Betty Colt faces up to 10 years behind bars if she is found guilty of recruiting a child to commit a crime.

The prosecution is expected to call Billy's brother Bobby to give evidence tomorrow.

In other proceedings last Friday, detectives took DNA swabs from Betty and her daughter Raylene Colt, as police gather evidence they hope will lead to charging a number of the family members with incest and other offences.

Warrants to arrest five other Colts were also issued, with most of the clan declining to turn up to court last week.

Investigators are yet to execute those warrants as it is understood the Colts are on the run across the country.

Detectives believe they have spread to at least South Australia and Western Australia.

A strike force made up of members of the NSW child abuse squad - spearheaded by detective inspector Peter Yeomans and detective sergeant Kirsty Hales - is pursuing the case that has been revealed as one of the most shocking acts of abuse in the country's history.

Betty Colt's hearing is expected to conclude tomorrow. If she is found guilty, her criminal conviction will be the first to arise from the investigation that has already rescued generations of inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the reclusive family which lived in the picturesque hills of outback NSW.

In court Billy was asked why he was removed from the Colts.

'I think because we were living in motor homes,' he replied.
