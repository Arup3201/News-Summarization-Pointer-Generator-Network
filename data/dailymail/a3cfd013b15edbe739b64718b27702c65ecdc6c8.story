WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Live TV can be a cruel mistress and no one knows that better right now than reporter Siobhan Riley after she unwittingly drew a shape resembling a large penis on a Tuesday evening bulletin.

The unfortunate – if hilarious - incident happened during a live news report on ABC12 which covers the mid-Michigan area.

Riley was using an onscreen map to show viewers an area in the center of Saginaw blighted by construction work when she drew the undeniably phallic shape.

The clip of Riley’s dodgy drawing has of course gone viral and attracted plenty of smart alec comments about how maybe she had something else on her mind while she was presenting the news.

Neither Riley nor the TV station have commented on the incident.
