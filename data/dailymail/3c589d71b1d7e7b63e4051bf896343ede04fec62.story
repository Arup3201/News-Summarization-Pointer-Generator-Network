Burns survivor Turia Pitt has fronted a room full of upcoming beauty queens to teach them about the meaning of true beauty as part of the Miss World Australia competition.

The 26-year-old suffered horrific burns to 65 percent of her body when she was caught in a bushfire while running an ultramarathon in Western Australia three years ago.

Ms Pitt has since been travelling the country giving motivational talks using her experiences and remarkable recovery to inspire others, including the 2014 Miss World Australia contestants on Saturday.

The former model is among the beauty pageant's judging panel for the final to be held in the Hunter Valley on Sunday night.

Last year's Miss World Australia winner, Erin Holland, said Ms Pitt's talk served as a 'wake up call' and had a huge impact on the 44 contestants.

'Every single girl said they were completely moved by Turia's talk and it made all of them reassess the way they think about life,' Ms Holland told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're all faced with adversity in our life but with a positive outlook you can overcome anything and that's exactly what Turia shows us.

'You may think you're having a bad day but she went through the most extreme version of that. Turia has rebuilt her body and her mind and she's done it all with a positive attitude - she's the most incredibly inspirational person I've met.'

Irena De Filippos, who took to Instagram to share her reaction to Ms Pitt's talk, said everyone has the ability to transform ordinary into extraordinary.

'Turia Pitt is incredible as she reminds us that, while what she went through made her find the strength she never knew she had, we don't have to wait until something bad/big happens to us to do great things and find great strength,' Ms De Filippos said.

The 44 young women will be judged in the final stages of the competition on Sunday, with Ms Holland joining Ms Pitt on the judging panel before she has to hand over the crown to the next Miss World Australia.

'We've got a brand new crown this year that raises awareness about cruelty-free jewellery,' Ms Holland said.

The crown contains $30,000 worth of Topaz, white Sapphires, Aquamarines and Elfh, which is created Ivory.
