With a career founded on making Star Wars characters from papier-mâché, it was never going to be long before she came to the attention of Turner Prize judges. Being a nudist called Spartacus probably helped.

The art prize that has baffled the nation since its inception is back – and its nominees are as unconventional as ever.

The favourite is Spartacus Chetwynd, who changed her name from Lali five years ago to show that ‘people have a choice in life’.

Spartacus Chetwynd: Odd Man Out

Odd Man Out by female performance artist Spartacus Chetwynd, which has been nominated for this year's Turner Prize. The show, which addressed issues of democracy, saw participants catapulted down an inflatable slide to a space littered with charred limbs

Chetwynd, 38, who 'lives and works in a nudist colony in south London', changed her name from Lali on her 33rd birthday 'to remind people they have a choice in life'

Her other work includes An Evening With Jabba The Hutt 2003, in which she recast the villain from Return Of The Jedi as a 'Stevie Wonder-type smooth operator'

The 38-year-old lives in a nudist colony in South London and specialises in performance art involving her friends and family.

She is known for her 2003 play An 
Evening With Jabba The Hutt, featuring bikini-clad women and a giant 
papier-mâché model of the villain from Return Of The Jedi as a 'Stevie Wonder-type smooth operator'.

She has drawn on everything from the 
Incredible Hulk to Conan The Barbarian and re-enacted Michael Jackson's 
pop video Thriller and the wildlife drama Born Free.

The artist, whose mother is a set 
designer who won an Oscar for Howards End, is always a participant in 
her productions, wearing just a bikini for An Evening With Jabba The 
Hutt.

Paul Noble: Public Toilet

The nominated piece of work by Paul Noble - entitled Public Toilet - which forms part of the fictional metropolis he has been creating over the past 15 years

Paul Noble, 48, from London, has called his city project Nobson Newtown

Her other work includes a week-long 
performance The Walk To Dover, in which she and her troupe dressed as 
Victorian street urchins to retrace the steps of Charles Dickens' 
character David Copperfield.

For the Turner, she is shortlisted for
 her five-hour play Odd Man Out, in which puppets re-enact Bible scenes 
and actors dance in home-made costumes. Audience members are asked to 
determine the play’s outcome via secret ballot.

Judge Andy Hunt called Chetwynd an 
‘interesting character’, adding that the name change had ‘liberated 
her’. The artist has previously said: ‘Like my art, my name change 
annoys people. The moment it stops annoying people, I will rename myself
 again.’

Chetwynd is among four artists 
shortlisted for the £25,000 prize.

Hot on her heels is Paul Noble, 48, 
who has spent 15 years drawing a fictional city populated by human 
faeces who engage in sex acts.

His nominated work is called Public Toilet - which forms part of his imaginary metropolis.

The inhabitants of the partially ruined city are living excrement, who, in some scenes, engage in orgies.

His work, which was on show at the city's Gagosian gallery last year, has been described as a parody of an ideal city.

Noble, whose work includes a hellish 
Heaven and a utopian Hell, has said that he will only make one more work 
in his Nobson Newtown series.

Judges praised his visions of a ‘dysfunctional and dystopian world’ in which ‘people become turds and turds become people’.

He was nominated for an exhibition which featured a faeces-shaped sculpture compared by critics to a Madonna and child.

Also shortlisted is abstract film-maker Luke Fowler, 34, from Glasgow, for his film exploring the life and work of Scottish psychiatrist RD Laing.

The artist is nominated for his solo exhibition at Inverleith House in Edinburgh, which includes the project All Divided Selves.

He has also made a film about avant-garde Scottish composer Cornelius Cardew.

Then there is Elizabeth Price, 45, from London, who is in the running for the contemporary art prize for a trilogy of video installations - including the work, User Group Disco.

Her other creations include West Hinder, 
inspired by the sinking of a ship in 2002 with a cargo of luxury cars, 
and The Woolworths Choir, which featured degraded footage of girl 
groups.

The £40,000 Turner Prize sees £25,000 go to the winner and £5,000 each for the other shortlisted artists.

The prize, established in 1984, is given to a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the 12 months before April 24 this year.

Tate Britain director Penelope 
Curtis, who is chair of the jury, said of the shortlist: 'They are 
artists that have brought a kind of slowness of looking, it's not a 
quick fix.

'None of 
these works are something that you can get in a few minutes. You have to
 spend an hour or two to get it, whether it's film, drawing or 
performance.'

The judges said there was a 'humanity' running through all the artists' work.

They hailed Noble's art as 'a compelling life project' of 'incredible, monumental graphite drawings'.

His work is an 'utterly compelling ongoing narrative' and a 'limitless journey of discovery', they said.

The artist takes almost 'an omnipresent view' of a 'dysfunctional world' in which 'people become turds and turds become people'.

The Turner judges described Chetwynd, whose recent
 exhibition Odd Man Out 2011 took the form of a five-hour play 
addressing issues of 'democracy, the right to vote and the consequences 
of decision-making', as a 'very interesting character' who involves the 
audience in her work.

'She changed her name in 2007. That seems on the face of it... a small point.

'But the idea of changing her name to
 Spartacus... seems to have liberated her to make this ongoing 
increasingly diverse form of practice that includes as many people as 
possible,' the judges said.

A Tax Haven Run By Women was inspired
 by 'financially independent women' such as Dolly Parton and took the form 
of a game show with two teams competing for a ride to a tax haven.

Fowler, best known for his film portraits of public figures, is said to have an 'autobiographical and biographical thread to his work'.

Price started to make films four years ago and has a musical background - she co-founded the indie-pop outfit Talulah Gosh.

Judges praised her 'powerful body of work over the last three years'.

Work by the shortlisted artists will go on show at Tate Britain in October and the winner will be announced in December.
