Robin van Persie has warned Radamel Falcao he will have to fight for his place at Manchester United following his dramatic deadline day move.

Falcao’s £6million loan from Monaco could become a permanent transfer worth £52m if the Colombia striker proves to be a success at Old Trafford, where he will earn £280,000 a week.

But despite the departures of Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez on Monday, Van Persie believes Falcao still faces plenty of competition.

‘I welcome his arrival, he makes us better,’ said the Holland striker. ‘At a top club you should always go for the best, which also fits my philosophy.

‘Falcao must fight for his place, as I also have to. We must battle with Wayne Rooney and James Wilson to see who is playing.’

Falcao is in Miami, where Colombia play Brazil in a friendly on Friday night, and he is hoping to secure a work permit in time to be available against Queens Park Rangers a week on Sunday.

His father revealed yesterday that Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool were among the clubs who showed an interest in the 28-year-old. Radamel Garcia also claimed Real Madrid pulled out of the running because they would not commit to a financial package that will exceed £20m for one season.

He said: ‘The deal with Real Madrid did not happen because if you have money and you go to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers, you have to decide whether to buy it or not — Real Madrid chose not to. I have a feeling they wanted the player free with a number of conditions. In any case, they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better. We have to accept it.

‘The clubs that showed an interest in him were Juventus, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal at the last minute. Thank God everything came through with United.’

Falcao’s arrival signalled Welbeck’s departure and the England striker claims he left for Arsenal in order to be the main man at a top-four club.

Welbeck, 23, has been desperate to prove himself as a central striker in recent seasons. However, more often than not, for club and country, he has been utilised as wide player.

But with injured Gunners striker Olivier Giroud out for four months, he will now be given his chance.

‘I’ve been at United ever since I was a little boy and I had a great time there,’ said Welbeck, speaking for the first time since his £16m move.

‘I believe in their style of play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away.

‘This is the next stage of my development, to really show people what I can do. I’d like to bring pace and power to the game.

‘I’ve envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.

‘Arsenal have done well in recent years, last year we got the FA Cup and I feel like it’s time we could really push on and try and challenge for the Premier League title.

‘I’ve got one Premier League medal and it’s something that I really want to add to.’

United defender Guillermo Varela, David Moyes’s first signing at Old Trafford, has joined Real Madrid on loan until the end of the season having failed to make an appearance for the club.

Tom Cleverley, another man to have left Old Trafford in the transfer window, was unveiled as an Aston Villa player on Wednesday after completing his season-long loan move.
