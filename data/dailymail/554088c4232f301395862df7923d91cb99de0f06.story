 It is one of the biggest impact craters on Earth - and until now, scientists have been unsure how it got there.

The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3  miles deep.

Researchers have been unsure how it formed - but now say it was a giant comet, not a meteorite as previously thought.

They say it was caused caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago. 

The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep. It was formed by a comet hitting Earth 1.8 billion years ago, researchers have found.

Following the impact, the large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, gold, and other metals.

As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world's major mining communities. 

Due to the high mineral content of its soil, the floor of the basin is among the best agricultural land in Northern Ontario. 

Collaborative research led by geologists at Trinity College Dublin has found strong evidence that one of the largest preserved impact structures on Earth was caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago.

The findings of this ancient impact are particularly topical with the current mission to provide more information about comets successfully relaying images of Comet 67P to the European Space Agency. 

A critical aim of the mission was to test whether the terrestrial hydrosphere was delivered by comets to an originally dry Earth.

In a recently published study in the international journal Terra Nova, the Trinity-led geologists explain the rationale behind their assertion that the Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, was caused by a comet - and not a meteorite.

Comets are composed by dust and frozen gas and carry few heavy elements, whereas meteorites are solid rocks that delivered iron-loving elements, such as platinum, to a younger Earth.

By conducting geochemical analyses of the siderophile (iron-loving) elements found in and around the crater fill – and by modelling the impact with computer software – the geologists showed that whatever crashed to Earth was almost completely vaporised on entry.

The Vredefort crater, Free State Province, South Africa: 190 miles wide - created 2billion years ago

The Sudbury Basin, Ontario, Canada: 160 miles wide - created 1.8billion years ago

East Warburton Basin, South Australia: 120 miles wide - created 300million years ago

 A meteorite of sufficient size to create a crater as large as the Sudbury Basin should only be partially vaporised on entry, which leaves a 'comet-as-culprit' scenario as by far the most likely.

Professor of Geology and Mineralogy in the School of Natural Sciences at Trinity, Balz Kamber, said: 'Our findings provide further evidence that some very large terrestrial impact basins were created by comets, which is important and interesting in the context of the early bombardment of our inner Solar System – it might well be that comets were responsible for bringing volatile elements to the young Earth.'

 The development of a mining settlement occurred in 1883 after blasting connected to the railway construction revealed a large concentration of nickel and copper ore at the Murray Mine site.

As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world's major mining communities. 

The region is one of the world's largest suppliers of nickel and copper ores, all found on the outer rim of the basin.
