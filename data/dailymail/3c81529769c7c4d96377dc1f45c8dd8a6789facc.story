Block: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is refusing to give the guidelines the official sign-off from government

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is blocking controversial guidance which would allow teenagers to stockpile the morning-after pill, it has emerged.

NICE, the NHS rationing body, wants to issue advice to GPs and chemists to give all women access to ‘advance provision’ of emergency contraception.

Critics say the move could fuel promiscuity and also lead to a rise in sexually-transmitted infections - because the pill is only taken after unprotected sex.

These concerns are understood to be shared at the highest level in the Department of Health. Now Mr Hunt is refusing to give the guidelines the official sign-off from government.

The advice has been on his desk since spring but he has not yet given it the go-ahead over concerns that NICE has not provided any evidence that the move would bring down unwanted pregnancies.

It is not known whether Mr Hunt will actually block the guidance, or whether he will allow it to be published but make it clear that he does not want the Health Service to comply.

A Whitehall source said: ‘NICE produced no evidence that this would reduce unwanted pregnancies. There are real worries it would lead to increased rates of sexually-transmitted diseases.’

The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence first recommended in draft guidance brought out three years ago that teenage girls and young women should be given the morning-after pill to keep at home in case they need it.

It took the controversial decision despite the fact there is no evidence that advance access to emergency contraception brings down pregnancy rates.

NICE said that under-25s should be able to get emergency contraception in advance in a range of high-street pharmacies. It is not current common practice for the morning-after pill to be given out for young women to store at home.

The draft guidance sparked outrage that the regulator wants to see increased spending on contraception at the same time as wanting to deny hundreds of cancer sufferers drugs that could potentially save their lives.

It will only become official guidance if Mr Hunt gives it the green light.

Last month an expert warned that letting women keep stocks of the morning-after pill will not cut unwanted pregnancies or abortions.

Professor James Trussell, from Princeton University in the US, said: ‘I don’t think it’s a strategy that is going to lead to a reduction in unintended pregnancies or abortions.’

He also warned that there is also evidence to show the guidelines make women more inclined to have unprotected sex - as they come to regard the morning-after pill as a safety net.

The draft NICE guidance, issued in 2010, says doctors, nurses and pharmacies should ‘ensure all young women are able to obtain free emergency hormonal contraception, including advance provision’.

The guidance was issued despite the fact that, earlier in the year, the respected Cochrane Library concluded women with advance supplies of emergency contraception fare no better than those without early access.

NICE is supposed to make its decisions on what should be funded on the NHS by weighing up the evidence.

At the time, Norman Wells, of Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘The draft guidance is clearly more interested in getting young people to use contraception than it is in discouraging them from engaging in sexual activity in the first place.

‘Confidential contraceptive schemes are simply giving children under the age of consent the green light to experiment sexually. The result is more schoolgirl mums, and spiralling rates of sexually transmitted infections.’

Last night Josephine Quintavalle, from the pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, described NICE’s draft guidance as ‘appalling’.

‘It’s an entirely new interpretation of emergency,’ she said. ‘The idea was that this pill was to be taken in an emergency, but if you can just have it in the cupboard - how is that an emergency?

‘It is not clear whether this works as a contraceptive or an abortive agent. Whatever, it’s a serious drug - and that’s worrying for young girls because it’s an adult drug and not necessarily appropriate for teenagers.

‘Women will think I have this pill so I am protected, but that doesn’t protect against sexually-transmitted disease. The UK does not have a good record on that.’

She welcomed Mr Hunt’s stance. ‘It would be helpful if he came out and made a loud and clear statement that this is not good medical practice,’ she said.
