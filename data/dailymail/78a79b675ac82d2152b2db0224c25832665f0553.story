Marseille striker Andre-Pierre Gignac has indicated he plans to leave the club at the end of the season.

Gignac, whose contract is up in June, told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'As a kid I dreamed of becoming a professional with Marseille but now I'm pretty much thinking that at the end of the season I'll leave. I'm looking for new, high-profile challenges.'

With 11 goals, Gignac is currently Ligue 1's joint-top scorer alongside  Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette.

The France international joined Marseille from Toulouse in 2010 and initially struggled. However, last season, Gignac scored 16 league goals, and has 65 in 193 games in all competitions for the club.

The 28-year-old fueled speculation he might join Serie A giants Inter Milan, saying: 'It would be a great (opportunity).'

As well as leading the scoring charts this season, Gignac also has the most Ligue 1 goals in 2014. The Marseille man has scored 19 goals so far in 2014.Â 

Toulouse frontman Wissam Ben Yedder is second with 18, whilst Zlatan Ibrahimovic is joint-third with Lacazette on 17.
