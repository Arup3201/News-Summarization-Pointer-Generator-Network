A 21-year-old snowboarder was killed Wednesday morning after accidentally triggering an avalanche in Utah.

Blake Ford, 21, and a friend ventured out into Hell's Canyon, a steep and narrow out-of-bounds area just outside the Snowbasin Ski Resort in Ogden, at around 10.40am.

After making only a few turns, the pair of snowboarders set off a slide, which carried Ford about 1,500 vertical feet to the bottom of a shallow and rocky gully, according to the Utah Avalanche Center.

It took a team of rescuers accompanied by a dog more than an hour to find Ford's body buried in the snow

The 21-year-old native of Morgan, Utah, was buried under about 3 feet of snow, reported Fox 13.

Lt. Brandon Toll, of the Weber County sheriff’s office, said Ford's friend tried to come to his aid, but could not locate him.

Ford was not wearing an avalanche beacon at the time of the incident

‘He started to find articles of clothing, gloves and such,’ Toll told KUTV. [He] still couldn’t find his friend.’

It took rescuers accompanied by a dog more than an hour to track down and dig out the snowboarder's body.

Ford was not wearing an avalanche beacon at the time of the incident. His companion, who was descending behind him, escaped the avalanche unharmed.

According to his Facebook page, Ford, a 2012 graduate of Morgan High School, lived in Ontario, California, and worked as area manager for a solar energy company.

He is survived by his parents, a stepfather and three siblings.

His grieving mother described the 21-year-old as a hard-working, fun-loving person who died doing what he loved most.

At least seven human-triggered avalanches took place on Utah mountains Wednesday, two of them caused by snowboarders.
