EU bureaucrats want new percolators to switch off automatically within five minutes of brewing

They've already banned powerful vacuum cleaners and outlawed traditional lightbulbs.

Now Brussels has come up with a new way to force us to save energy – and it will be particularly hard to swallow for coffee lovers.

EU bureaucrats want our new percolators to switch off automatically within five minutes of brewing.

New measures came into effect yesterday which demand that everything from computer modems to ‘smart’ televisions must have the ability to go into standby mode if no task is performed for several minutes.

Although coffee machines bought at Christmas are likely to be exempt from the ruling, new ones must meet the stringent EU energy regulations.

As with vacuum cleaners, it is understood shops can still sell the old models while stocks last. 

But it could prompt another retail frenzy as people rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes.

The European Commission says the changes will save consumers money on their electricity bills and be better for the environment, but critics say it will leave people with cold coffee. 

The new rules state that drip filter coffee machines that have insulated jugs to keep the drink warm must power down their heated plate or element five minutes after brewing.

Those with non-insulated jugs must go on standby within 40 minutes of use. Espresso machines should turn off after half an hour.

It is the latest in a string of controversial energy-saving changes brought in by the EU.

Traditional lightbulbs have already been axed and Europe barred powerful vacuum cleaners in September – which sparked a stampede to buy high-power models in the UK. 

The EU is also expected to impose limits on high-power hairdryers, irons, kettles, toasters and even lawn mowers.

The latest diktat will fuel claims that consumer choice is being restricted, even though analysis by the New Economics Foundation found the new rules on coffee machines alone could save consumers a total of £46million a year in energy by 2020.

Other experts suggested that any coffee brewed for longer than 40 minutes would be undrinkable anyway. 

Marylyn Haines Evans, of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, said: ‘With a better-designed appliance you can enjoy a coffee without the bitter taste of wasting energy or adding unnecessarily to the climate problem.’

From yesterday, new devices connected to the internet 24 hours a day such as modems, routers and smart TVs and printers must also go into standby mode when not in use. 

Eurocrats say all the changes would save an average household about £32 a year.

Monique Goyens, of the European Consumer Organisation, said: ‘Improving the energy consumption levels of everyday consumer products is the right approach to contribute some relief to consumers from increasing energy bills.’

The changes to vacuum cleaners prompted public outcry in what was later dubbed ‘Hoovergate’. The directive banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and this will be further reduced to 900 watts by 2017.

To help homeowners beat the EU ban, The Mail teamed up with Hoover to offer readers an exclusive discount on several top vacuums.
