Children as young as 10 were part of a ‘criminal army’ of Roma immigrants which included 13-year-old wives ‘bought’ for up to 170,000 pounds each, a court heard today.

Details of the sinister network emerged during the trial of 27 men and women aged between 19 and 55 in Nancy, eastern France.

All face up to 10 years in prison after being accused of a wide range of crimes, ranging from robbery to people trafficking.

The case began on the day that France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius declared
 Romania and Bulgaria should not be allowed into the passport-free 
Schengen zone due to security fears.

Ultimately run by a 66-year-old woman, the network expected boys and girls to bring in at least 4000 pounds a month through robbing people in the street or in their homes.

Accused: The house of one of the Roma families who have gone on trial in France. It is located in the town of Slavonski Brod in Croatia

It comes as Britain braces itself for an influx of Roma from Bulgaria and Romania when EU labour restrictions are eased next year.

Gilles Weintz, the detective who led the enquiry into the France-based ring, said all those involved were Roma originally from Croatia.

‘We are facing an extraordinary phenomenon of burglary on an industrial scale,’ said Mr Weinz, who said the gang – made up of three clans – operated all over France, Belgium and Germany, with more than 100 robberies in 2011 alone.

Male leaders ‘bought young wives’ for the cash equivalent of up to £170,000 each from other families in Croatia, and selected them especially for their stealing skills.

‘The better they were at stealing, the higher the price was,’ said Mr Weintz.

‘Young looking women also commanded higher prices because they had a better chance of passing themselves off as minors.

‘The burglaries were carried out daily all over Europe,’ he added. ‘They never stopped - for the children it was like a form of military service.’

Those running the ring were monitored via tapped phones which revealed a ‘mafia style’ network, with those in charge using their stolen money to buy upmarket properties in Slavonski Brod in Croatia.

The defendants, who cannot currently be named because of legal restrictions preventing the identification of the numerous children involved, deny all the charges.

The officer cited the case of a woman
 identified as Nathalie who had been bought but failed to live up to 
expectations by bringing in 'only' 200,000 euros over two years.

Her
 family was allegedly ordered to pay back 100,000 euros but the amount 
was finally reduced to 55,000 to take into account the sexual abuse she 
had suffered.

The 
children meanwhile were expected to bring in up to 5,000 euros per month
 each in the form of stolen goods that were then sold on through fences 
in France and Germany, helping to finance luxury lifestyles for the clan
 chiefs, some of whom owned upscale properties in Slavonski Brod in 
Croatia.

Their leader, the 66-year-old woman, is being tried separately.

All argue that their complicated financial transactions were based on traditional Roma dowry arrangements, and that the phone tapping was illegal.

Defence lawyer Alain Behr also said the current anti-Roma feeling in France meant they could not get a fair trial.

‘I hope there will not be a judicial stigmatisation as there is currently a political stigmatisation,’ said Mr Behr.

Speaking on France Inter radio today, foreign minister Laurent Fabius said France is not in favour of allowing Romania and Bulgaria into Europe's passport-free Schengen zone for now due to concerns about border security.

He said: 'If there is not a change in conditions, we won't be in favour.'

His comments came amid fierce debate within France's ruling coalition over the treatment of the Roma population.

Some 20,000 Roma migrants from Romania and Bulgaria live in hundreds of squalid make-shift camps on the outskirts of French cities.

Tensions with local communities have made Roma migration a contentious issue ahead of municipal elections next year.

Romanian and Bulgarian citizens currently have the right to travel with a passport throughout the Schengen zone, which removes border controls among most EU countries as well as non-members such as Switzerland and Norway.

Fabius fears lax immigration laws in those countries could mean any nationality could gain French access

Temporary restrictions that imposed passport checks were put in place when the two countries joined the EU in 2007, and are due to be lifted in January.

But each EU country has the right to veto the admission of a member state into the Schengen zone and a vote is expected before the end of the year.

Germany said in March that it too opposed the entry of the two countries into the zone.Fabius said France was concerned about the ability of Romanian and Bulgarian authorities to ensure border security.

'People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe,' Fabius told the radio station.

'There's a problem there, we must be sure that Bulgaria and Romania have the means to verify that.

'For the moment, it strikes me that those conditions have not been met,' he said.

Last week, Interior Minister Manuel Valls caused uproar in the left-wing governing coalition by saying most immigrant Roma could not be integrated into society and should go home.

The far-right National Front has made the issue a top campaign theme for March's municipal elections, warning of a new influx of immigrants if Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are allowed to travel freely without passports in the Schengen zone.

The Nancy trial, which involves 17 male defendants and 10 women, continues.
