Apple's iWatch could be the firm's next smash hit and sell 60 million units within a year, a leading analyst has claimed.

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty says the watch, expected to cost around $300, will sell between 30 and 60 million units.

She believes it could sell as many units as Apple's smash hit iPad, and far more than the iPhone in its first year.

Speculation
 around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release 
date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch.

The analyst says Apple's 'halo' effect will drive sales, and outlined three scenarios for sales.

In the 'base case,' the iWatch follows the iPhone’s adoption trajectory, selling 30 million units in the first 12 months at $300 apiece, generating an extra $9 billion in revenue and adding 49 cents to Apple’s bottom line.

In the 'bull case, the iWatch follows the iPad’s trajectory, selling 60 million units and the stock hits $132 per share by this time next year.

There's also a worst case 'bear' scenario where iPhone sales go flat, mainstream consumers lose interest in wearables and Apple’s share price falls to $74.

Earlier this week it was claimed Apple's iWatch has been delayed and will not begin mass production until November, it has been claimed.

It is believed the firm has delayed the watch to ensure the hardware and software is perfect at launch.

However, it is believed the firm could still announce the device in October at a special event.

In a research note obtained by AppleInsider, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iWatch represents a new level of difficulty for Apple in regard to both hardware and software development.

'Kuo estimates Apple will push back mass production to mid- or late-November, one month later than previous models claiming large-scale manufacturing would start in late-September,' the site claims.

'With only a few supplier ramping up ahead of an anticipated October release, supplies of the wearable will be constrained and are unlikely to meet market expectations of 10 million shipped units by the end of 2014.

'Instead, Kuo says about 3 million iWatches will be in the wild by year's end.'

Apple recently  poached a senior executive from Swiss luxury watch brand Tag Heuer, which could be to help it with the launch of its iWatch expected this autumn.

Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant (pictured) was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month, and is believed to have met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team to discuss upcoming products - including the iWatch.

Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple.

It did not say what his new job would be, and Apple declined to comment.

Jean-Claude Biver, head of watch brands at LVMH and chairman of watch brand Hublot, said he believed the threat of smart watches had to be taken seriously by the Swiss watch industry.

'The iWatch will have the same status symbol power as many other Apple products, especially at the beginning,' he said.

'I personally believe it has the potential to be a threat for the industry, and it should not stay with its arms crossed.'

Apple applied for a trademark for the "iWatch" in Japan, a patent official said earlier this week, signaling the iPhone maker could be moving ahead with plans to launch a watch-like device soon.

Speculation has been mounting that Apple was preparing to launch an iWatch which would include multiple health and fitness sensors and access to features such as messages and notifications through integration with the iPhone and iPad.

A sweat sensor is believed to one of at least 10 sensors on the watch.

It has also been revealed Apple has signed up a host of sports star to try the wearable - including basketball star Kobe Brant, who was recently spotted at Apple's Cupertino campus.

According to laoyaoba.com, the sweat sensor has been developed in house by Apple.

Although the watch is shrouded in secrecy, players from the MLB, NHL and NBA have believed to have been approached about the fitness aspects of the watch.

One of these athletes is reportedly Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant, who was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month.

According to 9to5Mac's source, Bryant met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team, to discuss upcoming products.

Apple is also believed to be working with Los Angeles Kings' Dustin Brown and an unnamed player from the Boston Red Sox, according to 9to5Mac.

However,  laoyaoba.com also claims the watch may be delayed as it must be certified as a medical device with the Food and Drug Administration.

Apple has already revealed it is working with Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and the National Institutes of Health on its HealthKit app, which is believed to work in tandem with the iWatch.

Earlier reports say the watch will includes more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data.

It is also set to come in multiple sizes - and is expected to go on sale in October.

The much rumoured watch is believed to be about to begin mass production in Taiwan.

The Wall Street Journal also said that Apple is planning multiple screen sizes for the device, and previous rumour have claimed a male and female version will be released.

Rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular.
