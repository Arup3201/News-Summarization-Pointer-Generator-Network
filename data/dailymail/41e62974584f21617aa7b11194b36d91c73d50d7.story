A hidden village which has rarely been seen since the 1930s is slowly rising from its watery grave.

Mardale Green , in Cumbria, disappeared in 1935 when the valley was flooded to make way for the Haweswater Reservoir, which would later serve Manchester with water.

Hundreds of people were evicted from their homes and most of the village's buildings were blown up by Royal Engineers who used them for demolition practice.

With the warmest September since 1960, the small Cumbrian village of Mardale Green - that has rarely been seen since the 1930s when it was flooded by the Manchester Water Authority to make way for Haweswater Reservoir - is rising from its watery grave

Farm buildings, pubs and even a church and its graveyard were dismantled stone-by-stone. Meanwhile, coffins were removed from the graveyard and buried elsewhere.

The stones from construction sites were re-used to build the water  tower, now situated along the Western shore of the reservoir.

But nearly 80 years on, water levels at the Haweswater reservoir are starting to drop significantly due to the lack of rain during the recent dry summer months.

The remains of the ancient structures, including farm gates and tree stumps, have now been revealed beside the receding waterline.

'It has been the driest start to September since 1960,' said a spokesperson for the Met Office.

When the Haweswater Dam was built, it raised the water level by 95ft (29 metres). It created a reservoir 4 miles (6km) long and around half a mile (600 metres) wide

When the Haweswater Dam was built, it raised the water level by 95ft (29 metres) and could hold 84 billion litres of water.

The dam created a reservoir 4 miles (6km) long and around half a mile (600 metres) wide. Its wall measures 1,541ft (470 metres) long and 90ft (27.5 metres) high.

It was considered to be an engineering feat in its time, built from 44 separate sections, fixed together with flexible joints.

The reservoir is now owned by United Utilities and supplies about 25 per cent of the North West's water needs.

'In Cumbria, there was 2.3mm of rain, which is only 2 per cent of the expected rain fall for September.

'Between September 1 and September 15, we would expect around 50 per cent of the rainfall for the month.

'However for that period there was only 2 per cent - just 2.3mm of rain. An average monthly rainfall for September is 117.4mm of rain.'

Mardale Green was considered one of the most picturesque villages in Westmorland, Cumbria, and many people thought it should be left alone

It is fed by various streams and aqueducts from Swindale, Naddkle, Heltondale and Wet Sleddale. 

There was a public outcry at the time of its construction. Mardale Green was considered one of the most picturesque villages in Westmorland, Cumbria, and many people thought it should be left alone.

Lake District writer and walker Alfred Wainwright lamented the passing of the old valley. He wrote: 'Mardale is still a noble valley. But man works with such clumsy hands!

'Gone forever are the quiet wooded bays and shingly shores that nature had fashioned so sweetly in the Haweswater of old; how aggressively ugly is the tidemark of the new Haweswater.'

Today, thousands of visitors flock to see its ruins laid bare by receding waters in the years of drought.
