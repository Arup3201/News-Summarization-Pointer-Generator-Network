Spare tyre Andy Gray, flaunting his paunch on holiday in the Caribbean recently, said the scandal that cost him his Sky Sports job still haunts him

Shamed pundit Andy Gray has revealed he considered killing himself over the sexism scandal that resulted in him being sacked from Sky Sports.

The former TV personality, who was axed for suggesting a lineswoman didn’t know the offside rule and asking a female presenter to tuck a microphone into his trousers, said he remains haunted by the furore and even considered taking his life.

Gray, who was earning £1.7million a 
year at Sky, is now forced to get by on £150,000 and last year put his 
£4million Warwickshire mansion up for sale.

Asked if he’d considered suicide, Gray, who was sacked along with co-host Richard Keys, said: ‘Yes. I would be lying if I said I didn’t.

‘I had never felt like I have felt from January 25 (last year) onwards.

‘It happened on a Saturday morning. I got a call on Monday from Andy Melvin (deputy head of Sky Sports) just telling us “Don’t come in today for Monday night football.”

‘It escalated from there for some reason, I’ve no idea why.’

Gray insisted that his remarks regarding Massey and Jackson were ‘light-hearted quips’.

He added: ‘I do not see myself as sexist. Not in a million years.  

‘I have four daughters and I was brought up by a wonderful mother on her own. She’s 91 and is distraught about what happened.’

Amid fury about Gray’s comments, a video emerged of Keys asking pundit Jamie Redknapp if he ‘smashed it’ when talking off air to an ex-girlfriend.

In a third clip Gray asked Sky presenter Charlotte Jackson to tuck his microphone down his trousers.

Keys later blamed ‘dark forces’ for both their exits, suggesting that Sky bosses had wanted them out.

However they both later released grovelling apologies.

Since then the pair have returned to the media, working for radio station talkSPORT.

They have also cashed in on their notoriety by touting themselves as after-dinner speakers under the catchline 'Andy Gray & Richard Keys Smash it!'

Their manager told the Guardian they charge £9,000 to speak for 40 minutes and are happy to discuss their crude comments that led to them being forced out of Sky.

Georgina Brassington told the paper in December: 'They'll do anything. They'll do any presentation, they'll speak for 40 minutes – whatever you want.

‘They have been going down an absolute storm. They've got so much banter.'
