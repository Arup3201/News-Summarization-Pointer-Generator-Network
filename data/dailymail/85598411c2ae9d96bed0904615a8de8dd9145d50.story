A teenage drug dealer was caught by police after ordering 500 Ecstasy tablets online under his own name before having them delivered to the home he shares with his parents.

Harry Doherty, 19, bought the haul of tablets online from a supplier in the Netherlands with the intention of selling them around clubs in Manchester.

But he was rumbled when he requested for the package to be addressed to himself at his real address.

When police later raided Doherty's bedroom and asked if he had any drugs in his possession, he even told them that he had ordered drugs online, but it had not yet arrived.

Doherty, now 20, was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court after admitting importing Class A drugs, possession with intent to supply and possession of cannabis.

The court heard how Doherty's crime had been one of 'crass stupidity' but that drug dealing was a 'serious business'. 

Sentencing, Recorder Robert Crawford said: 'This is crass stupidity but a serious business and you understand that.

 The court heard Doherty (pictured) had committed an act of 'crass stupidity' 

'I think this is a tragedy. A 20-year-old lad like you who has never been in trouble before, now facing serious charges. You have been stupid and naïve.'

The court heard how the parcel had been quickly intercepted by customs officials at Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre in Berkshire. They had opened the container after being  suspicious of the package's contents. 

When they checked the destination, they found it was addressed to Doherty's parents' home in Levenshulme, Manchester.

Officers later asked Doherty if there were any drugs in the house, to which he replied: 'Yes, I ordered a parcel off the internet but it hasn't arrived.' 

But they went on to find almost 4g of MDMA concealed in a Kinder Egg, as well as 12 further packages of the drug at 90 per cent purity, with a street value of £932.

They also retrieved £1,140 in cash, scales and a small amount of cannabis. 

The court heard Doherty, who works as a chef at a café, thought of himself as being part of the Manchester rave scene.

He took Ecstasy himself but had started drug dealing purely to make money, the court was told.

Prosecuting, Simone Flynn said: 'On June 21 2013 Her Majesty's Customs officials intercepted a package at Heathrow Distribution Centre in Berkshire and when they opened it they found a container with 500 tablets.

'The package was addressed to this defendant, Harry Doherty, at his home address in Levenshulme. GMP were contacted and informed and following communication a drugs warrant was executed at the home address.

The young chef even told police who raided his home (pictured) that he had ordered a pile of drugs from the internet but that they had not yet arrived

'Officers attended on July 9, when they arrested the defendant and asked whether drugs were in the house his response was "yeah, I ordered a parcel off the internet but it hasn't arrived".

'That's because the police had intercepted it.'

She added: 'On interrogation of one phone there were numerous incriminating drug dealing messages. The defendant played a significant role and was clearly motivated financially by way of the texts.'

In mitigation, defence counsel Anthony O'Donnell said: 'He was involved in that scene, the rave scene, and was taking ecstasy himself.

'As regards to being sophisticated, you only have to look at the fact his name and address were on the envelope. The word "naivety" springs to mind.'

At Manchester Crown Court (pictured), the defendant was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution after admitting importing Class A drugs and possession with intent to supply

He added: 'In chatting with him it is simply unbelievable that he is here. He is a very intelligent young man who has worked since he was 14. He has never brought any trouble to his parents' door.'

Doherty, dressed smartly in a shirt and blazer, puffed out his cheeks as the judge Mr Crawford said he had no option but to send him to a young offenders' institution.

He said: 'There are many things that can be said constructively in your favour and I will give you a great deal of credit. This sentence is as short as it possibly can be in light of my public duty. I have been extremely lenient.

'My hands are tied in a case like this. You can't import ecstasy on this scale and not be dealt with by a custodial sentence.'
