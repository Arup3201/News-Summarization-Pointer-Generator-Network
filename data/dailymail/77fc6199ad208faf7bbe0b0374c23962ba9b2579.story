Resignation: Yingluck Shinawatra has been forced to step down after Thailand's Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power

Thailand's prime minister has been forced to resign after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abusing her power, pushing the country deeper into political turmoil.

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, 46, was charged with abusing her authority by transferring a senior civil servant to another position in 2011.

The court ruled that the transfer was carried out with a 'hidden agenda' to benefit her politically powerful family and, therefore, violated the constitution, an accusation she has denied.

'Transferring government officials must be done in accordance with moral principle,' the court said in its ruling.

'Transferring with a hidden agenda is not acceptable.'

It is not immediately clear who will become the new acting prime minister.

The ruling also forced out nine Cabinet members who the court said were complicit in the transfer of Thawil Pliensri from National Security Council Chief to a role in Yingluck's office.

The verdict marks the latest dramatic twist in Thailand's long-running political crisis.

It is a victory for Yingluck's opponents who for the past six months have been engaged in violent street protests demanding she step down to make way for an interim unelected leader.

But it does little to resolve Thailand's political crisis as it leaves the country in limbo - and primed for more clashes.

Since November, more than 20 have been killed and hundreds injured in demonstrations.Â 

The ruling also casts doubt on whether new elections planned for July will take place, which would anger Yingluck's mostly rural supporters who have called for a major rally in Bangkok on Saturday.

It also remains far from clear whether her opponents will be able to achieve other key demands, including creating a reform council overseen by a leader of their choice who will carry out various steps to rid the country of corruption and what they say is money politics, including alleged vote-buying.

The campaign against Yingluck has been the latest chapter in Thailand's political upheaval that began when her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted by a 2006 military coup.

It came after protestors accused him of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for the constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

Controversial: She was charged with abusing her authority in 2011 when she moved a civil servant to another position. Her supporters claim she has been the target of a 'judicial coup'

Raising a glass: Protestors, who have been filling the streets and calling for Yingluck to be ousted for the last six months, toast their 'victory'

The Constitutional Court in 2007 made
 a landmark ruling dissolving Thaksin's original Thai Rak Thai party for
 fraud in a 2006 election, and banned its executives from politics for 
five years. Thaksin went into self-imposed exile in 2008 to escape a 
two-year jail sentence for conflict of interest while prime minister.

Thaksin's allies in late 2007 handily
 won the first post-coup election, but the Constitutional Court in 2008 
kicked out two successive pro-Thaksin prime ministers.

A coalition government then cobbled 
together by the opposition Democrat Party had to use the army to put 
down pro-Thaksin demonstrations in 2010 that left more than 90 people 
dead in street battles, but Yingluck and her Pheu Thai party won a 
sweeping majority in a mid-2011 general election.

Yingluck's fortunes plunged when her 
party's lawmakers last year used shady legislative tactics to try 
to ram through a law that would have given an amnesty to political 
offenders of the previous eight years, including Thaksin.
