 

A Police Commissioner has used not one but three buckets of ice water to complete the Ice Bucket Challenge after being nominated by two sergeants.

The challenge is part of a viral campaign to raise money for Motor Neuron Disease.

Detective Sergeant Rob Jamison and Sergeant Brad Richard Scully, from Kensington, near Perth in Western Australia, nominated Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan, who accepted the challenge on September 4.

Western Australia Police uploaded the video to YouTube, showing Commissioner O'Callaghan being drenched by a triple serving of ice water.

He thanked the sergeants for the nomination before two officers, and one other unknown person tipped the buckets of frosty water over him. 

'This is to raise money for motor neuron disease or ASL, as you know it. 

'It is a terribly debilitating disease and we want to do something about that - we want to fix it. 

'So I'm going to sit down now and get some ice water poured over me,' Commissioner O'Callaghan said. 

The Commissioner's breathe was taken away as the three buckets of frosty water poured over him, giving out a soft 'ohhh' three times. 

After completing the challenge Commissioner O'Callaghan wiped himself down with a towel as he nominated the next three ice bucket victims. 

'I nominate Andrew Hadley, who's the CEO of P&N Bank (Police and Nurse Bank), Wayne Gregson, who is the chief commissioner of the DFES (Department of Fire and Emergency Services) and James McMahon (Commissioner of Corrective Services in WA), who hits up our prison services.'

The YouTube video  has had over 2,000 views since it was uploaded on September 4.

People suffering from of the debilitating Motor Neuron Disease are given two to five years to live once diagnosed. 

There is no cure for the disease which slowly attacks the  nerve cells, eventually stopping them  from being able to move, speak, breathe and swallow.

Since the Ice Bucket Challenge reached Australia on August 10, more than $700,000 has been raised for Motor Neuron Disease research.
