Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has praised Paddy McNair ‘tremendous’ debut against West Ham.

The 19-year-old defender was thrown into first-team action by Louis van Gaal after injuries to Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans plus suspension for Tyler Blackett.

McNair helped United to a 2-1 win at Old Trafford, with the youngster making a crucial headed clearance to deny Enner Valencia in the second half.

‘That was probably one of the bigger tests a young defender can face, up against a team putting in lots of crosses into the box, but he took it and stood up to it,’ Rooney told the club’s official website.

‘It won’t get much tougher in terms of physical strength and aggression against him, but he dealt with it and we are all delighted with him.

‘I saw the clearance he made at the end. I thought he was tremendous for us.

‘Although we let Tom Cleverley go on loan [to Aston Villa] and Danny Welbeck go to Arsenal, we have brought in a young Manchester lad in Tyler Blackett who played every game until Saturday.

‘The situation was forced on the manager but he has brought Paddy in and it’s shown he isn’t afraid to throw young players in.’
