Francis O'Neill had 'no comprehension' that he had beaten his wife of 40 years Monica, 73, (pictured) who was found dead in the hallway of their home in Malvern, Worcestershire

A dementia sufferer who had no idea he had battered his wife to death and still asks for her daily has been detained indefinitely.

Francis O'Neill had 'no comprehension' that he had beaten his wife of 40 years Monica, 73, who was found dead in the hallway of their home in Malvern, Worcestershire.

The grandmother was found with 65 injuries, including broken ribs, a blunt blow to the head and a broken tooth.

Worcester Crown Court heart that Mr O'Neill, a grandfather-of-four, appeared confused and bewildered after approaching neighbours for help at 11.45pm on January 20 last year. 

Police were called to the couple's home, where they found Mrs O'Neill's body in the hallway.

A post-mortem recorded her death was caused by extensive injuries to her head and body.

Mr O'Neill, who had been married to his wife for more than 40 years, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but was deemed unfit to stand trial because of his illness.

He was subsequently tried under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 and was found to have killed Mrs O'Neill by a special verdict by a jury last November.

The former merchant seaman was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital at Worcester Crown Court on Monday.

Judge Robert Juckes QC also ruled that further restrictions for public safety under section 41 of the Mental Health Act should be put in place if his release is ever considered.

He said Mr O'Neill had never 'appreciated what he had done' and said he still asks about his wife even now.

Paying tribute to Mrs O'Neill after the hearing, her family described her as a 'proud grandmother, devoted mother and loving wife', who volunteered at the WRVS shop at Worcestershire Royal Hospital.

Her three children Sinead O'Neill, Martin O'Neill and Katherine Letchford added: 'If our mum ruled the world it would be spring all year round.

'She was born on a Good Friday and loved to see the daffodils and crocuses coming out, knowing her birthday was just round the corner.

'(She was a) proud grandmother, devoted mother, loving wife, good neighbour, trusted confidante, loyal friend.'

The court heard Mr O'Neill, known by his second name Brian, had suffered from significant dementia for a number of years and it was getting progressively worse.

At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Gareth Walters said the couple's neighbours Brian and Carol Holt were awoken by Mr O'Neill asking them how to contact 999. 

Mr O'Neill seemed 'quite unaware' of what had happened but had an injury to the knuckle of his right hand, which continued to swell.

He claimed he had left her watching TV, saw her asleep and then shook her to try to wake her.

Police found him 'confused and bewildered' and after being assessed as having dementia, he was not interviewed by officers.

Neighbour Brian Holt told the court: 'Brian seemed completely oblivious to what happened. He was concerned about where his house keys were.

'I still can't believe what has happened. They were a very loving, happy couple.'

In her statement, Carol Holt said: 'Mrs O'Neill was a lovely lady and had a good relationship with her husband, who referred to her as "The Commander", and she did everything for him.'

Forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt added: 'Mrs O'Neill died from multiple injuries, including a blunt injury to her head.

'Some of her injuries may have been accidental or through a fall down stairs but others were consistent with blows from a fist or defensive wounds as she tried to protect herself.'

Detective Inspector Andrew Price, from West Mercia Police, said: 'This is a particularly tragic case for all concerned.

'I am satisfied with the decision of the jury and feel the sentence was appropriate given the defendants continuing mental health issues.

'My thoughts are with Monica O'Neill's family at this difficult time.'
