Virgin Australia are investigating  standards on-board their planes following an irate passenger's video in which he documented the lack of cleanliness on his flight from Sydney to Melbourne.

The man known only as Stuart Mc called the video: ‘Virgin Australia – A Disgrace' and filmed a dirty seat, chewing gum, dirt and paper littered around flight VA 868 from SYD to MEL.

Despite the obvious filth surrounding the man's seat, a spokesperson for Virgin Australia told Daily Mail Australia that the airline is committed to providing flyers with a clean environment and will be looking further into the circumstances surrounding the man's flight. 

What looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum 

'Virgin Australia prides itself on delivering a superior customer experience which includes maintaining a high standard of cleanliness on board our aircraft,' the spokesperson said. 

'This example is clearly not up to that standard and we are investigating as a matter of priority.' 

However it was definitely a warts and all video with filthy aisles and seats the first thing you see. 

The disgruntled man made his opinions clear during the video, which he uploaded to YouTube, claiming he would prefer if the carrier spend more time on their standards than promoting cheap fares.  

'And they want us to believe Tiger is the discount carrier.... this is the seat I was allocated this afternoon on VA 868 SYD to MEL. Obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for Virgin Australia,' Stuart Mc commented on the YouTube segment.

Dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat

As the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum, dust, grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat.

It's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while. Even the arm rests were dirty. It was a gross rather than great experience. 

Not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes. 

After splashing out up to £9,000 on first class flights on British Airways from Gatwick to the Caribbean, on what was supposed to be a 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat.

Dust, detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot  

The arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while 

Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the service 'Filth Class'.

Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off.

'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins

There is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest

'This is first class. This is British Airways First Class. It's disgusting.'

The former BBC anchorman and reporter flew off to St Lucia with a companion on Saturday in First Class seats that retail on BA's website for nearly £9,000 each in peak-season January.

In 2000, the Virgin brand entered the Australian aviation market for the first time. The new brand Virgin Australia was launched in May 2011 to be Australia’s airline of choice.
