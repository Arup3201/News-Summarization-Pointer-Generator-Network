Police descended on a Roma camp today in France to evict its residents in a new crackdown agasint illegal immigrants.

Men, women and children were carrying out their belongings as they are were removed from the camp in Lille, northern France. 

In the past year France has shut down many illegal camps full of Roma gypsies which have sprung up around the country.

Eviction: People from the Roma community carry their belongings into a bus as they are expelled from their camp in Lille, northern France

Destroyed: Earth moving equipment is used to destroy the makeshift homes

Removed: A child sits on his belongings as police move in to clear the camp

Determined: Diggers moved in to make sure that the Roma community could not return to their temporary homes

With an estimated population of about 15,000 Roma in France, and the government seems determined to expel as many as it can.

In August there were similar raids and hundreds of Roma gypsy families being forcibly sent from France back to their countries of origin in Romania and Bulgaria.

Those evicted from camps in France were 
herded together under the watchful eye of CRS officers (the French 
equivalent of the riot police) wearing military-style blue outfits and 
black leather boots, then taken to airports and put on flights to their 
home countries.

Leaving: The residents were shipped out of the area on coaches

Final: A girl looks out the coach as the site is destroyed. There is an estimated population of about 15,000 Roma in France

The French are so determined to move on the Roma that they offer them financial incentives.

In addition to covering the cost of the trip home, the French government pays 300 euros (£235) to every expelled Roma adult and 100 euros (£80) for every child.

Reports of Romanian gangs perpetrating organised crime, such as cashpoint fraud, are common in France — as in the rest of Europe — and this only serves to whip-up anti-Roma sentiment.

In total, nearly 1,000 Roma have been deported following at least six raids last summer.

The exact figures are hard to establish because the French authorities are not allowed to define those they have ejected as ‘Roma’, because this would suggest that their actions are potentially racist and therefore illegal under EU law.

Packed up: Roma residents put their belongings in the back of the coach before being driven away

Only the vulnerable — pregnant women, the frail and the elderly — are given housing by the French social services.

However, healthy young men have been seen fleeing into nearby woods, or through the streets to avoid being rounded

Marine David, mayor in Saint-Priest, admits the French authorities are playing a game of ‘ping-pong’ with the gypsies.

‘We are going round and round in circles,’ she says. ‘We can’t offer them a permanent housing solution, and I know there’s a risk they will just set up another camp. We just don’t have the means to deal with this kind of situation.’

This game of human ‘ping-pong’ began under the previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who ordered the ejection of around 9,000 gypsies, only for many of them to return. He introduced the deportation crackdown in 2010 after linking the Roma community to begging, prostitution and petty street crime.

Despite promising tolerance and humanitarian assistance if elected, Sarkozy’s successor, Socialist President Francois Hollande also approved the eviction programme after he and interior minister Manuel Valls said the camps were adversely affecting the lives of the French working class living near to them.

Local councils’ court orders to destroy camps are all approved by the national government.
