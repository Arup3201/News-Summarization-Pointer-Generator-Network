A 22-year-old college dropout has launched an exclusive black metal credit card only available to hand-selected New York City residents.

Billy McFarland, the son of real-estate developers from Short Hills, New Jersey, is behind the Magnises, a credit card marketed as the hottest way for the young elite to spend.

Hopefuls have to go through a strict vetting process before they can join, but if they get in, they are privy to a wealth of perks, including a driver, a West Village townhouse and parties on yachts.

Magnises is 'Latin for absolutely 
nothing',' McFarland told the New York Post. 'The name
 is made up, but it sounds grand, doesn't it?'

To become
 a member, applications complete an online form that asks where they 
prefer going out in the city, where they shop and where they dine - 
apparently to ensure that the Magnises team is only granting access to 
the creme de la creme.

Among
 the 30 per cent of applicants McFarland and his 11 staff accept, they 
seek people aged between 25 and 25 from 'all walks of life' from fashion
 to finance, the team told Business Insider.

But if you pass the phone interview, Google search and two weeks of vetting, you will receive your own black stainless steel card - and plenty of perks.

The 1,200 users, which include DJs, tech innovators, socialites, models and Olympic hopefuls, get access to a members-only hangout at a townhouse lined with art in the West Village.

They can also use a BMW 7L and 
a driver; a 24/7 concierge service that arranges concert tickets and reservations at the city's top restaurants; free classes at David Barton Gym and free drinks.

This summer, they are hosting yacht parties and setting up appointments for members to get custom wardrobes.

'When I get out of work early, I’ll go to the townhouse and get oysters 
and cocktails,' 22-year-old Gwen Tetirick, who works in business
 planning said. 'I wanted someone to curate my life for me.'

Exclusive: To get the Magnises card, you have to cite New York's hottest spots as your favorite places to go

Perks: Once you're in, you can have unlimited access to the team's West Village townhouse, pictured

Luxury: The company also hosts exclusive dinner parties and cocktail evenings at the apartment

The team behind the card say that their members are handpicked to create this exclusive atmosphere.

'[We like] smart people from 
great schools, so they have the family background and education,' 
Emir Bahadir, a real estate exec and an adviser to Magnises, told the Post.

Interestingly, the card isn't expensive and is simply a duplicate of a credit or debit card the user already owns - meaning it links to that bank account rather than another one.

Magnises has an annual cost of just $250 and no spending requirements - compared to American Express' black 
card, which costs $7,500 in starting fees and
$2,500 annually.

McFarland has received $1 million from investors including former Def Jam CEO Kevin 
Liles and former MasterCard International chairman Lance Weaver, the Post reported.

For McFarland, who is pictured online partying on yachts with bikini-clad women, it's just the latest in a line of projects he's been dabbling with since he was a teenager.

High life: The perks also include parties over the summer on a yacht and access to a BMW 7L and a driver

No complaints: McFarland, second from right, dropped out of college in his freshman year and has launched three companies since he was a teenager. He hopes to expand the card to other cities

At age 13, he launched a service that matched websites and designers before heading to Bucknell University but dropping out during his freshman year to launch a content-sharing company, Spling.

From there, he moved on to Magnises. McFarland explained to Business Insider that the idea came about last summer as he spoke with friends about their credit cards.

He thought they could be so much better if they were used in more personalized ways.

'Take this thing you’re using five times a day, make it more community-based, and then build perks around it that affect your everyday life,' he said.

After conquering New York, the company plans to expand, with Washington D.C. next on the list.
