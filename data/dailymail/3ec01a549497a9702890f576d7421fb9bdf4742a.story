The do's and don't to secure a happy holiday season around your family

@highlight

Plan. Sit down with your partner and write a list of everything that needs to be done – assign tasks and  stick to them. That way no one can be accused of not pulling their weight.

Take some time for  yourself. Go for a walk or have a hot bath. You need time to recharge your batteries and stay relaxed.

Make an effort with the  in-laws. Aunt Betty might drive you crazy, but getting along will make your partner feel at ease.

@highlight

Offer to help. If you see your partner is stressed, suggest you take on some more tasks. Be proactive.

@highlight

Accept that Christmas  and relationships are never perfect. Lower your expectations and accept  that most of the time, it’s  the effort that counts.

@highlight

Say I love you. It helps.

@highlight

Start a deep debate when you have been drinking. It  will only lead to tears and unnecessary arguments.

@highlight

Bring up past problems. Regurgitating previous relationship issues is likely  to taint memories of the entire festive period.

@highlight

Complain about how much everything costs. Christmas  is expensive but it creates lasting happy memories, so spoil yourselves a bit.

@highlight

Forget that human contact can say everything, whether holding hands or cuddling on the sofa. Touching is crucial.

@highlight

Forget to spend quality time together, especially when your house is full of relatives. Let relatives look after the kids while you and your partner go for a walk.

@highlight

Let issues build up. If you are feeling neglected, ask your partner for a hug  and calmly explain how you feel. Don’t blow up in a tantrum or sulk.
