A devious carer stole more than £13,000 from a 92-year-old deaf man she was supposed to be looking after, a court heard.

Mother-of-one Kelly Day, 38, systematically drained John Filmer's bank account while working for Tender Loving Carers in Kent.

Mr Filmer, of Whitstable, Kent who appeared in the witness box in his wheelchair, told the court he thought Kent County Council had been taking the cash.

Stolen money: A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard how Day had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after John Filmer

But a jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard yesterday how Day had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after the pensioner.

Day was caught slipping the bank card into Mr Filmer's wallet, pretending she was returning cash from a shopping trip.

She later admitted to stealing £300, claiming she could not pay her rent arrears and feared eviction - but claimed it was the only occasion.

But what she did not know was the wallet had already been checked by a police officer and social services staff who had become suspicious of money disappearing.

Day, who worked for TLC, which is based in Kent and supplies domiciliary carers to disabled and vulnerable clients, was sacked immediately.

She was found guilty of the second theft and will be sentenced for both matters next month - after being told by Judge Simon James to expect a custodial sentence.

Prosecutor Ian Foinette said Day, who
was on a rota of carers looking after the pensioner, took thousands of 
pounds without his knowledge.

He
said to Day: 'So it was just coincidence was it, that May 21 was the 
only day you took money and the only day a police officer and social 
services happened to be there?

'You were effectively caught red-handed and you knew the game was up.

'It had been an ideal opportunity for you to take Mr Filmer's card that morning and help yourself to £300 and slip it (the card) back in a bit later.

'The money which disappeared was £13,200 which, had he been given it as Day claimed, he would have been awash with cash.'

Day claimed she had been evicted a number of years ago and feared she would lose her home again if she didn't pay her rent arrears in the home where she has lived for 17 years.

The carer claimed Mr Filmer had given her his bank card and she had made the withdrawals over the year - in defiance of her company's policy - but said it was with his permission.

She told the jury the money was used to pay for shopping and buying clothing items - sometimes taking out hundreds of pounds.

She also claimed he gave her a set of keys to let herself into his home.

The carer claimed on numerous occasions she had failed to fill out a financial transaction form which was required by the company.

Day, giving evidence said: 'I saw an opportunity and I took it and I've admitted it.

'I didn't know a police officer would be there when I went round that day.

'I had every intention to pay the £300 back.'

Day was granted bail until the next hearing.

Tender Loving Carers managing director Brigitte Grutzmacher said: 'We have no tolerance with any person who may pose a possible risk of abuse in any form to any of our clients.

'Our company has supported and helped the police fully with all their enquiries. The client in question is still using our services which is a testament to the company proving that we put the client first.'
