A teenager who had a massive heart attack and 'died' for seven minutes was saved thanks to the quick thinking of his teacher.

Dan Edwards, 17, collapsed after running up the stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment.

His heart stopped beating and the teen was technically dead - but managed to make a miraculous recovery after one of his tutors started CPR - giving him a fighting chance until paramedics arrived.

Thanks Sir: Dan with teacher Matt Harwood who gave him CPR while waiting for paramedics

Tutor Matt Harwood desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes, feared the worst.

After arriving at hospital, worried doctors warned his terrified parents, Sue and Darren, that they didn't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did, feared he would be severely brain damaged.

But amazingly, a month after his brush with death, Dan has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in Worcester.

His mother, Sue, 40, an NHS 
administrator, said: 'We are so grateful to everyone who has helped Dan 
pull through - we can't thank them enough.

'We
came so close to losing our son, we're just so grateful that so many 
people knew basic first aid, and for everything the doctors have done 
for him.

Dan's scar: He fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat

'Even after Dan's heart had been restarted, the doctors told us they didn't know if he'd make it through the night.

'We were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped, and now we were being told we might lose him forever.

'It was devastating. Once his heart had been stabilised, they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long.

'We were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later, Dan was sitting up in bed laughing and joking.

'Even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones.'

Engineering student Dan had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart.

But after running up a flight of stairs at the Worcester College of Technology, to grab his coat, the teenager suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed, on September 28.

Fortunately, one of his tutors, engineering manager Matt Harwood, heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that Dan had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began CPR.

He was joined by colleagues, including community first responder David Price, who took over the CPR, until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator.

Dan said: 'I can't remember much about what happened. I felt like I was in a swimming pool and I had fallen asleep. I could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name, but I didn't know where I was.

'I'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it hasn't really sunk in yet how serious it was.'

Dan's parents were already at Worcester Hospital, waiting for Dan to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in.

Sue said: 'We were completely panicked - it didn't seem real when they said Dan had collapsed and was in an ambulance.

'We feared the worst, and seeing him in intensive care was devastating.

'The doctors told us they didn't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick.

'He was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma.

'They said it would take a long time for him to wake up, but four days after it happened, he was alert and awake.

'The nurses said there's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did.'

Relieved: Dan with his mother Sue, father Darren and sister Megan

Matt said: 'We knew that Dan's life was in the balance, so we all worked as hard as we could to save Dan.

'The paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance.

'I think someone must have been looking down on him.'

Dan, who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat.

The device, slightly larger than a matchbox, monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low-voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed.

Dad Darren, who works in manufacturing, said: 'We are so grateful to the staff at the college, and especially to Matt, who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly.

'We want to share Dan's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it's so simple that anyone could do it, but all of Dan's friends have said that if he'd collapsed in front of them, they wouldn't know what to do.

'I can't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son's life - there's no way we can repay them.'
