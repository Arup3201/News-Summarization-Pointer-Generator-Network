A wanted man who taunted detectives by posting a series of selfies online showing him outside police stations and next to marked cars has been arrested after two weeks on the run.

Aaron Bee, 22, mocked Lincolnshire Police's attempts to track him down after the force revealed he was wanted in connection with an assault and domestic violence.

The father of one, from Lincoln, goaded the force by posting a series of taunting selfies on Facebook captioned with 'catch me if you can'. He also bragged that he 'always liked playing hide and seek.'

Aaron Bee, 22, mocked Lincolnshire Police's attempts to track him down by posting a number of selfies on Facebook showing him outside various police stations in the county with captions such as 'catch me if you can'

The 22-year-old, wanted in connection with an assault and domestic violence, posted pictures of himself outside five different police stations including Lincoln (above) during his time on the run from detectives

Since Lincolnshire Police announced officers were hunting Bee on October 29, he has visited five police stations across the county and posted photographs of himself outside each one online.

In one status update to his 1,635 friends, he wrote: 'Just a quick selfie outside Lincoln police station '£theystillcarntcatchme (sic)'.

In another, he uploaded an image taken from a car window of a female officer standing by a roadside with the caption: 'Hello is it me your looking for (sic)'.

Additional pictures uploaded include Bee standing next to a police van with the heading 'my new motor haha' and another one of him stood outside Lincolnshire Police's headquarters.

However, officers revealed today that they had finally caught up with Bee and arrested him at a cafe in Lincoln after almost two weeks of looking for him.

A spokesman for the force said: 'A 22-year-old Lincoln man wanted in connection with domestic violence and assault has been arrested.

Bee took to social media after Lincolnshire Police launched a bid to find him on October 29, saying he 'always liked playing hide and seek'. He later joked that the authorities' efforts to track him down were 'fun and games'

In another, he could be seen stood posing outside Lincolnshire Police's headquarters in the dark 

In his most recent status update, prior to his arrest, Bee said he had walked into Tesco and bought some food

'He is currently in police custody and will be questioned by officers concerning an assault and an incident of domestic violence which occurred in October in the Lincoln area.'

In his latest post, just hours before he was caught, Bee had bragged: 'To say I am that WANTED I have just walked into Tesco to buy a doughnut and to buy some new bits for rabbit hutch carnt be that wanted surely lmao (sic).'

Lincolnshire Police launched their appeal to find Bee a fortnight ago and released his mugshot in an attempt to get the public to help with their hunt.

But, Bee took to social media to mock the force's attempts to trace him and branded the pursuit as 'fun and games'.

Speaking last week, he said: 'I did it because it's funny. It's just a bit of fun really.

'If I got one message for them it's still very much catch me if you can.

Bee, 22, wrote a series of Facebook status updates mocking Lincolnshire Police's efforts to track him down

'I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me.

'They are making me out to be a mass murderer of some sorts but I'm not a violent bloke. But they can't even find me.

'It's only criminal damage and assault and I haven't even been found guilty of them yet.

'I'm not going to hand myself in, they will have to track me down but they haven't tried that hard to find me.'
