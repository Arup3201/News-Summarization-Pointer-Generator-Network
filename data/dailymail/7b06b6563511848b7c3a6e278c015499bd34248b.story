Huddled over his pride and joy, his is the face of the perfectionist.

Using the steadiest of hands, Dave Patterson applies the deft finishing touch to his model carriage.

His addition may not have been noticeable to the crowds who descended upon the Model Rail Scotland exhibition yesterday. But for Mr Patterson, you can only suspect that does not matter.

For this is the zone of the enthusiast. Members of model railway clubs from all over the UK, and even parts of Europe, gathered in Glasgow's Exhibition Centre to purr over each others layouts.

Whether it be an intricately crafted landscape, or a particularly delicate paint job, the small details are always champion.

But fear not, model-makers, if you could not make it to Glasgow. Here is our gallery from the event.
