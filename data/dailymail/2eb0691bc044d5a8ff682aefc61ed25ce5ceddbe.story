Blunder: John Tunney, 63, was left partially blind and in need of round-the clock care

A retired paramedic who was left partially blind and needing round-the-clock care after a blunder by surgeons has been awarded more than £1million.

John Tunney, 63, was left severely disabled medical staff mistakenly removed the wrong part of his brain during 
an operation he didn’t need.

Surgeons removed healthy tissue during the operation instead of the tumour which caused a massive brain haemorrhage.

Blood test results - which were not checked before the biopsy - revealed the tumour was benign and could have been treated with tablets.

Mr Tunney, who worked as a paramedic with West Midlands Ambulance Service for 23 years, has been awarded the seven-figure sum from University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust after they admitted liability for the blunder.

He was awarded a long service award in 2005 and even went back to work part-time two days a week after he retired the same year.

Mr Tunney, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, had a series of tests in 2008 after he suffered suspected thyroid problems.

Doctors at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield performed an MRI scan which revealed abnormalities around his pituitary gland and he was referred to a specialist at Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry.

Mr Tunney, had a blood test to determine his hormone levels but doctors failed to check the results.

The
results would have revealed he was suffering from prolactinoma - a 
benign condition which can be easily controlled with tablets.

Mr Tunney, underwent
a biopsy on his pituitary gland on April 29, 2008, but suffered brain 
damage after the surgeon removed normal tissue instead of the tumour.

Mr Tunney's wife Pamela, 65, said: 'Our lives have both been completely devastated by a completely avoidable brain injury.

'It’s something that we have to deal with every single day of our lives.

'He gets very frustrated at times that he cannot do the things he once took for granted.

'I remember how we were initially so thankful that this underlying condition had been spotted early.

'Before the surgery he was a very easy-going, active person who was always on the go.

'To see the change in him and to know that it was all entirely avoidable is extremely upsetting.

She said the mistakes was 'not something that the hospital can just take back.'

'I
pray that they don’t make this sort of error again and no other family 
has to experience seeing their husband suffer the pain and loss that 
John has.

'John was 
forever praising the work of doctors, so it was only natural for him to 
put his complete trust in the surgeon after they told him that he needed
urgent brain surgery.

'It is appalling to think the surgeon managed to botch the procedure completely and then to find that the biopsy wasn’t even necessary makes me incredibly angry.'

The family have recently relocated to South Wales along with some friends who help Pamela with John’s constant care.

University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust admitted liability and today apologised to the family.

Meghana Pandit, chief medical officer from Walsgrave Hospital said: 'I would like to apologise on behalf of UHCW again to Mr Tunney and his family for the complications he suffered as a result of his treatment with us four years ago.

'While we acknowledge that the financial settlement he has now received can never compensate for his suffering, I do hope that our sincere assurances that organisational learning from his management mean that patients with similar conditions will experience high quality and safe care will be reassuring to him.'

Timothy Deeming, a medical law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors in Birmingham, who represented John, said: 'The fact that the surgeon managed to remove perfectly healthy tissue rather than a sample of the tumour tissue is, in itself, an appalling error.

'To then find that the procedure was totally unnecessary because clinicians had failed to review a blood test, really does add insult to injury.

'The failings of the surgeon involved are so serious that the family is calling on the GMC to investigate his actions.'
