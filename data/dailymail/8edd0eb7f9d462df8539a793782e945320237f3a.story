A former teacher at a prestigious all-girls boarding school was sentenced on Tuesday for sexually assaulting a 17-year-old student.

Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 43, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ten years probation for the attack at the exclusive Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut.

The former physics teacher must register as a sex offender for a decade after prison. Judge Joan Alexander told Rajkumar that as part of his probation, he could not teach or be near children under 16.

'I clearly violated the trust placed on me as a teacher,' Rajkumar told the judge, according to the courant.com.

The sentence will keep the sex offender away from his three children aged one, three and eight years old.

His
 wife, Sarah Rajkumar, begged the judge not to register her 
husband as a sex offender but Judge Alexander said it was required by 
law. 

Mrs Rajkumar said
 her husband was an 'exceptionally good man who made a grave error in 
judgment', adding that he had been overwhelmed by his responsibilities 
at the school and at home. 

Prosecutor
 David Zagaja said evidence pointed to the fact that Rajkumar had 
inappropriate conversations with five other teenage girls but no charges
 were ever filed.

The 
victim was not in court for sentencing although her father was present. 
The judge praised the student for coming forward to report Rajkumar's 
attacks.

Rajkumar who taught physics and coached soccer and track, was employed
 at the school in August 2009. He was fired on March 4  last year and charged on 
March 25 with two counts of felony second-degree sexual assault and one 
count of misdemeanor fourth-degree sexual assault.

Police said the allegations date back
 to 2010 and involve the former student who said that Rajkumar started
 groping her when she was 15 and that they had sex in his classroom 
closet and sent sexual videos to one another after she turned 17.

The
 allegations came out after the former student, who is now in college, 
told her boyfriend who went to the police, according to the Hartford Courant.

The
 former student said that it had started when she was 15 and that 
Rajkumar would hug her and run his hands down her back when she was 
stressed about big tests.

The girl told police that the situation developed and that she and 
Rajkumar had sex several times during some weeks. They had sex 
in a closet in his classroom.

Miss Porter's is a girls-only, college preparatory school where tuition costs up to $52,000 a year.

Miss Porter's day and boarding school
 was established in 1843 and is a small, private establishment with 306 
girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on 
the campus.

It takes pride in a vast array of 
extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater 
programs, pottery, painting and textile classes.

Tuition for this year costs $48,510 for boarding students and $38,510 for girls who attend day classes.

Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography.

The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens.

'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.'

Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947.

Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper. Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include socialite and fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer.
