This is the moment a frantic mother found her baby sleeping safely in the back seat of the family's car - after it was stolen with the seven-week-old still inside.

Louise Waine, 24, was captured on CCTV racing towards the vehicle in a state of panic, after a thief had snatched it and sped through Wigan with her son, Leo Moulsdale, in the back.

Leo had an astonishing escape after the car was stolen from under the nose of his father Thomas Moulsdale, also 24, and driven for three miles before being abandoned outside a pub.

The terrified parents searched the area until a call came through 15 minutes later to tell 
them the car had been found with Leo inside unharmed - and he had slept 
through the drama.

The thief struck at 7.35pm on 
Tuesday night, targeting the family's Subaru Impreza, which was parked in Orrell,
Wigan.

Plasterer Mr
Moulsdale had left the car running as he nipped out to knock on a door 
about a job. Seconds later the opportunist thief had jumped behind the 
wheel and began a three-point turn.

Ms Waine said: 'My head was just spinning, I just wanted my baby back. 
It was cold and dark and icy and I thought that I may never see him 
again. I kept thinking surely he would not hurt a baby, surely not, but I
just didn't know.'

Around 15 minutes later, Merseyside 
Police was informed by an anonymous call from a telephone box of a baby 
being left in an abandoned car near the Billinge Arms pub in Billinge, 
three miles away.

Ms Waine said: 'When I got there I just 
ran over to the car without my shoes and took him out of the seat and 
cuddled him. I couldn't believe it, I was just so thankful he had been 
found and it hadn't been too long.'

She added: 'Leo is my everything, I can't even begin to imagine what could have happened.

'I was trying to keep myself together when I picked him up and cuddled him but broke down in tears.'

Detective Constable Brendan Greally of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are urging anyone who saw the incident, or who witnessed the car being abandoned in Billinge to call police.'

The thief was described as a white man in his 20s, wearing a dark bob hat, a dark hooded top and lighter coloured trousers or tracksuit bottoms.
