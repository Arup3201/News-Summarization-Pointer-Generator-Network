Eight men on trial for murdering three others during rioting last summer walked free from court to whoops and cheers yesterday – after jurors were told the detective in charge of the investigation ‘lied’ on oath.

The defendants were sprayed with champagne as they emerged from Birmingham Crown Court after a jury took four hours to dismiss the three murder charges against each man.

Following the verdict, judge Mr Justice Flaux appealed for calm on the streets as police said extra officers would be deployed at the first sign of any trouble.

His sentiments were echoed by Tariq 
Jahan, the father of one of the victims, who was credited with 
preventing a race war on the streets of Winson Green last August.

Speaking outside court yesterday, Mr 
Jahan, 47, urged people to ‘accept the outcome’ of the trial and 
appealed for ‘peace and calm in our community’.

His son, Haroon Jahan, 20, and 
brothers Shazad Ali, 30 and Abdul Musavir, 31, were seen on CCTV being 
catapulted almost ten feet in the air after being hit by one of three 
cars involved in what the prosecution called a ‘modern-day chariot 
charge’.

The prosecution claimed the eight defendants – all in the cars involved – were guilty of a ‘joint enterprise’.

They said the lead car, an Audi, had 
worked to lure a crowd of Asian men which included the victims on to the
road, where they were then hit by one of the two following vehicles. 
But the defendants claimed the collision had been an accident involving 
no planning and many of them, including Ian Beckford, the driver of the 
Mazda which hit the men – knew the victims.

Following the conclusion of the 
12-week trial, it can be revealed that the officer in charge of the 
police investigation is under investigation himself for potentially 
jeopardising the prosecution by lying in the witness box.

Detective Chief Inspector Anthony Tagg
could face a charge of perjury after Mr Justice Flaux ruled he had 
‘invented’ an account given on oath about why defence barristers had not
been told of offers of immunity to eyewitnesses until mid-way through 
the trial.

The revelation, after the witnesses 
had given evidence, prompted the judge to temporarily halt proceedings 
to ask DCI Tagg to explain the mistake– only for him to claim 
prosecutors had been told of the issue at the start of the case.

The 
defence argued the ‘extensive’ lies rendered a fair trial impossible.

Barrister Michael Turner said DCI 
Tagg’s actions amounted to perjury, which carries a maximum sentence of 
ten years’ imprisonment.

In his submissions to the judge, Mr Turner said
of DCI Tagg: ‘He came to court and on any view lied pretty extensively 
about what he had said to counsel.’

Defence barristers urged the judge to throw out the case, an application he dismissed.

But he did tell jurors that much of 
the evidence of the eyewitnesses in question about the defendant’s 
behaviour in the cars that night could be considered unreliable.

Yesterday, West Midlands Police 
refused to accept that the blunder was to blame for the failure to 
secure a single conviction and said the judge could have halted 
proceedings if he felt DCI Tagg had jeopardised the trial.

The case has been referred to the 
Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has now launched an 
investigation into the detective’s conduct.

DCI Tagg has not been 
suspended.

Defendants Ryan Goodwin, 21, Shaun Flynn, 26, Juan 
Ruiz-Gaviria, 31, Joshua Donald, 27, Everton Graham, 30, Adam King, 24, 
Ian Beckford, 30, and Aaron Parkins, 18, all from the Birmingham area, 
hugged and shook hands in the dock as the verdicts were returned.

Moments later, the judge urged the 
people of Birmingham, including relatives in the public gallery, to 
respect the jury’s findings that the deaths were a ‘terrible accident’.

He said the deaths occurred at a time 
of unprecedented civil disorder.

‘It is important that however strong 
feelings are within the community in Winson Green and surrounding areas,
that calm is maintained and that these verdicts are respected,’ he 
added.

Mr Justice Flaux also directly addressed the victims’ relatives, including Mr Jahan, in the aftermath of the verdicts.

The judge told them: 'I know this has been really terrible for you, don’t think I don’t know that.

'I know Mr Jahan has done wonderful things for the city in ensuring we didn’t have a complete conflagration last August.

He paid tribute to the ‘wonderful’ work of Mr Jahan, who was in court as the verdicts were announced.

Harry Ireland, of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, said prosecutors had been confident the evidence 
collected offered a realistic chance of conviction.

An IPCC spokesman said: ‘Evidence was 
heard during the trial suggesting that certain witnesses may have been 
promised immunity from prosecution by the police in return for them 
giving evidence against the defendants.

‘The judge in a statement to the court
has since raised concerns about the evidence given to him by a DCI 
during this questioning, this was the senior investigating officer in 
the murder case.’

Evadne Gayle, a local shop owner, 
said: ‘I believe tensions are going to be high. Before the funeral 
thousands of people turned out – they won’t be happy.’

But a spokesman for Birmingham Central
Mosque, who said he was a relative of one of those killed, said there 
were no suggestions violence could erupt.
