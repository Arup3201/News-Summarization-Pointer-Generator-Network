The grief-stricken fiancée of a murdered man has taken her own life just days after he passed away.

Emma Rowlatt bid a tearful goodbye Kane Barry, her fiancee of only four months when she made the difficult decision to turn off his life support machine this week.

Mr Barry, a young father, was hospitalised after a violent dispute outside his  in Southport residence in south-east Queensland three weeks ago.

 According to Mr Barry's Facebook, he and Ms Rowlatt met in February this year and became engaged in May

During the September 16 incident police allege that he was choked and had his head bashed on the ­pavement by his neighbour, Nathan Sanchez, who has since been charged with the murder of Mr Barry. 

Ms Rowlatt and another neighbour reportedly tried to give Mr Barry CPR while waiting for an ambulance. 

Mr Barry was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital suffering brain injuries and never regained consciousness. 

Some friends only learned of Ms Rowlatt's death when they attended Mr Barry's funeral on Friday, reported the Courier Mail. 

Nathan Sanchez, 23, has since been charged with the murder of Mr Barry after the September 16 incident.

According to Mr Barry's Facebook, he and Ms Rowlatt met in February this year and became engaged in May. 

A crowd funding page titled Kane Barry Foundation was launched on September 21, and to date has raised $1,642, with a goal of eventually raising $10,000.  

Mr Barry's five-year-old daughter,  Ellie-May, attended the funeral yesterday.

Mr Sanchez will next be in Southport Magistrates Court on December 11.
