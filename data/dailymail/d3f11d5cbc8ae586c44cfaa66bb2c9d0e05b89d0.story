Arsonist Karl McGarry, 25, was tasked with petrol bombing a drug rival's car as part of an ongoing feud between two traveller families

An arsonist burned his own head when his 'Russian-style' hat set alight as he tried to torch a rival drug dealer's car.

Things then got worse for Karl McGarry, 25, when he also managed to set fire to his getaway vehicle.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that McGarry had become embroiled in a 20-year feud between two traveller families in St Helens, Liverpool.

A member of the Price family ordered him to firebomb two cars but when he leaned through one of their windows, his furry hat ignited.

Unaware that the headpiece was on fire, he got into his getaway car, setting that alight as well.

McGarry, who worked as a ‘full time 
drug dealer’ in St Helens, Merseyside, was later recorded on a police 
bugging device, complaining about setting his Russian hat on fire.

Another voice could be heard laughing: 'That was when you had that big mark on your head, weren’t it?'

Liverpool Crown Court heard the Price family was trying to control the supply of class A drugs in the town and had previously been known to petrol bomb and fire shotguns at the Maughans.

Eight of their gang were jailed for a total of 97 years last week for drug, firearm and arson conspiracies.

Prosecutor Neville Biddle told the court how McGarry arrived at the home of Patrick Maughan, a leading member of the gang, at around 11pm on July 30, 2011.

Mr Maughan was not there but his wife, who had just put their children to bed, looked out of the window and saw what happened.

Mr Biddle said: 'A car pulled up to the house and two men got out.

'The windows of the cars were smashed and some sort of lighter fluid or petrol poured into the cars and they were set on fire. McGarry was wearing a Russian style hat and he set himself on fire.

'The two men were observed to get into the Volvo and drive away in a blaze of flames.'

Father-of-two McGarry, from Knotty 
Ash, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to arson, conspiracy to supply class A 
drugs and burglary and was jailed for six years and eight months.

Oops: But McGarry's furry hat catches and alight and sets his own getaway car on fire

Stephen Swift, defending, said he was ‘utterly and completely out of his depth’.

Judge Denis Watson, QC, said: 'The context is of a feud between the members of the Price family and the Maughans.

'That feud had begun very many years earlier but the origins of the rivalry is not clear.

'Since March 2010 there had been a steady escalation of violence. It had become nothing short of a vendetta.'
