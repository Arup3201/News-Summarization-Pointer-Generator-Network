Legal trouble: John Attanasio, a former dean of Southern Methodist University Law School, has been arrested on a misdemeanor prostitution charge

A former dean of Southern Methodist University Law School has been arrested on a misdemeanor prostitution charge.

John Attanasio, 60, was taken into custody Sunday by Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and booked into the Collin County Jail.

The North Dallas resident, who is married with two grown sons, was later released after posting $500 bond.

Attanasio served as dean of SMU's law school between 1998 and 2013, when his contract expired and was not renewed.

A graduate of the prestigious New York University and Yale schools of law, Attanasio has retained his position as SMU's Judge William Hawley Atwell Chair of Constitutional Law.

The law school has declined to comment on the constitutional law professor's legal trouble.

Law enforcement officials also are keeping mum about the circumstances of Attanasio's Sunday arrest citing an ongoing investigation, reported the Dallas Morning News. 

According to his profile on the website of NYU Law School, where Attanasio is listed as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow, the 60-year-old jurisprudence expert has received a number of professional distinctions over the course of his long career, including a Fulbright scholarship and an Outstanding Faculty Member Award from Notre Dame Law School.

Ousted: Attanasio, a prominent constitutional scholar, served as dean of SMU's law school between 1998 and 2013, when his contract expired and was not renewed 

Distinguished career: Attanasio, a graduate of the prestigious New York University and Yale schools of law, has retained his position as SMU's Judge William Hawley Atwell Chair of Constitutional Law 

According to his NYU Law biography, since 1995, the former dean has co-organized seven summits between justices of the US Supreme Court and their counterparts in Europe. 

Attanasio's ouster in January 2013 caused an outrage among alumni, faculty members, financial supporters and the school's executive committee, who were upset that Provost Paul Ludden did not provide any explanation for his decision not to renew the dean's contract.

Attanasio has been described as a very effective fundraiser for the school who helped bring in more than $115million in gifts and pledges over the years. 

In good company: Last February, Attanasio (far right) co-organized a summit between US Supreme Court Justices and judges from the European Court of Justice.

However, not everyone was reportedly sorry to see Attanasio booted from his position as dean.

The legal blog Above the Law in January 2013 quoted an unnamed SMU student as saying that Attanasio was infamous for his arrogance, unpopular among his peers and widely mocked for his inability to use a computer.
