A celebrated sea otter who survived a natural oil slick and was tracked by researchers for six years has been killed by a shark.

The seven-year-old marine mammal named Olive was found dead by a beachgoer on March 22 near Sunset State Beach in California.

Wildlife biologists retrieved a large, serrated tooth fragment from white shark in a wound on the mother-of-three's body, indicating the cause of death.

Outside of the fatal bite wounds, Olive was reported to be in good health.

Olive made headlines in February 2009 when she was found covered in oil and near death on Sunset State Beach in Santa Cruz County.

A  rescue team from The Marine Mammal Center was dispatched to retrieve the oiled otter.

Her 'thick and tarry' fur was cleaned with a combination of diluted dish soap and olive oil, hence her name. 

In early April 2009, when her weight was back to normal and vets had given her the all-clear, Olive was deemed ready for release.

She was outfitted with a high frequency transmitter and colored flipper tags so she could be identified and monitored after her release.

In July 2012 Olive was re-captured for a health examination. 

Her blood values and physical examination were consistent with other healthy, wild otters, and it was determined that she was pregnant - the first known pregnancy.

Before her death, Olive was most recently seen in mid-February resting in kelp near Capitola. 

Olive had more than 5,000 Facebook followers, in an account set up by wildlife officials. 'Swimming' was listed as her sole personal interest.

Hundreds of followers expressed sadness after reading about her passing.

A message left by administrators read: 'Although we are extremely saddened by the death of Olive, we are grateful for the opportunity we had to learn from and about her. 

'Olive’s success in the wild after being oiled demonstrated the value of washing and rehabilitating oiled wildlife. 

'She thrived in the wild and successfully gave birth to and weaned three healthy pups, making a great contribution to the southern sea otter population, which is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 

'Olive also served as an ambassador for her species and other wildlife affected by oil.'

According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, shark bites are the leading cause of mortality of southern sea otters.
