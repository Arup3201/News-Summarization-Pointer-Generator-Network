Britain's Mark Cavendish relinquished his hold on the Dubai Tour lead as Germany's John Degenkolb claimed a potentially decisive win in Friday's third stage.

Stage one winner Cavendish (Etixx-QuickStep) fell out of contention for the finish of the 205-kilometre route from Dubai to Hatta Dam as Degenkolb (Giant-Alpecin) triumphed.

Cavendish finished 10 seconds behind the eventual winner Degenkolb in 17th place. Degenkolb picked up 10 bonus seconds for the win and consequently relegates Cavendish to second in the standings.

The German beat Alejandro Valverde and Juan Jose Lobato (both Movistar) to victory on a route which culminated with a steep ramp.

The Giant-Alpecin rider is better suited to slightly flatter finishes but he raced clear with 300m remaining. 

Degenkolb said: 'We're going to do everything to defend the jersey and bring the jersey home. It's going to be not easy, but I think we have still a good chance to get some bonus seconds and probably do a good result at the end of the race. I think it's not impossible.'
