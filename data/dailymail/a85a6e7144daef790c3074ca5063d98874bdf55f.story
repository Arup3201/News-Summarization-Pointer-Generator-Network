Waiting ages to pay the bill in a busy restaurant can take the edge off a tasty meal - especially if you're in a hurry.

But now there’s an app which lets diners either order ahead and pay for their meal, or settle a bill at the table using a smartphone.

This is the first time these services have been available in high-street stores in the UK.

PayPal's new in-app features are designed to make life easier for diners. People sipping a coffee at Prezzo can pay for their drink or meal at their table (pictured) without having to wait for a waiter to come over. There is also an in-built option to split the bill with friends

Although apps are already available that work out bills, and people can pay for coffees using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology, this is the first app of its kind to combine a number of different restaurant-friendly features that can be used on the high-street.

At the moment the service is restricted to select restaurants but the firm is planning to roll it out to more businesses over the next couple of months.

For example, the Order Ahead feature is only available at Wagamama. Diners can order and pay for a takeaway from the noodle bar via the app so that it will be waiting for them to collect.

People eating at Prezzo can pay for their meal at their table without having to wait for a waiter to come over, and there is also an in-built option to split the bill with friends.

Meanwhile, Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) customers can pay for meals using their PayPal profile picture, just using the app - they don't need their wallet.

‘The smartphone has changed our lives, and we wanted to use it to solve some of the most common frustrations about traditional ways to pay on the high street,’ said Rob Harper, Head of Retail Services at PayPal UK.

The company recently found that around three quarters of Britons hate queuing.

‘Our new Order Ahead and Pay at Table services save busy people valuable time. Why wait for the bill when you can pay at the table with your smartphone? And why wait in a restaurant for your takeaway when you can skip the queue by choosing and ordering ahead on your phone?’ he added.

Tom Cheesewright, Applied Futurist for 
Book of The Future, said: ‘People don't need to add a new app or account
 [beyond the standard PayPal app] or move money around in order to take 
advantage [of the new features].

‘The big name brands adopting the technology should accelerate the understanding and ultimately the use of mobile payments on the UK high street.’

PayPal already has the biggest network of high street stores - including Oasis and JD Sports - to let customers pay with their smartphone.

Mr Harper said: ‘It’s the beginning of the end for the wallet on the high street.'
