Sleek: The Ti is undeniably an attractive phone - but is it so good looking it is worth £14,200?

They can demand anything from local information to a table at the most exclusive restaurant in town.

The company claims its 3.7in sapphire crystal screen is 'virtually scratch proof' and four times stronger than other smartphones against impacts.

Its titanium case is also said to be around five times stronger than other smartphones.

The Ti is the latest high-end phone by the British company, which was formerly part of Nokia until it was sold to private equity outfit EQT last year.

Each handset is handmade and signed by a single craftsman at the company's factory in Church Crookham, near Fleet, Hants.

It hit the headlines in 2002 offering when it offered a £15,000 Nokia phone with 18-carat gold, white gold, and top-of-the-range platinum cases.

Perry Oosting, Vertu's president and chief executive, said: 'Vertu Ti is our most significant product for a decade.

'The Android operating system delivers a proven and intuitive environment for users, while the design and craftsmanship of the handset is still uniquely Vertu.

'Vertu has pioneered and led the luxury mobile phone sector since we began in the late 90s and the great depth of our knowledge and experience can be seen in Vertu Ti.

'There is nothing else like it.'

Prices for the handset start at £6,800 for the Titanium Black Leather model, rising to £14,200 for a version in red gold.

The 'Vertu key' on the new handset offers the concierge service and adds an additional 24/7 service called Vertu Certainty, which 'helps protect the device, its data and, where necessary, the customer'.

It also includes a 1.3mp front-facing camera.

Budget: For those with slightly less money to spend, this model is available for a mere £6,800
