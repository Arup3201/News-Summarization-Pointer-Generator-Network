Blue is the most common eye colour in Britain, researchers found.

All eyes in the country were once brown, but a study revealed they are now 48 per cent blue, 30 per cent green and 22 per cent brown.

The study, which mapped out eye colour across the UK and Ireland, revealed that the Scots and the Irish are more likely to have blue eyes than others - especially those living in the south.

Scientists believe the reason for the increase in the number of blue eyes could be to do with how attractive people find them.

Blue-eyed Britain: The study, carried out by ScotlandsDNA, revealed that the Scots and Irish were most likely to have blue eyes - with the largest population occurring in south east Scotland

South East Scotland reported the highest 
proportion of blue-eyed residents - 57 per cent - while blue eyes are 
least common in South West England, where they account for just 35 per 
cent.

South East 
and East England have similarly low proportion of blue-eyed residents - 
just 44 and 41 per cent respectively - while in all regions of Ireland 
at least half of people have blue eyes.

Alistair
 Moffat of ScotlandsDNA, which carried out the study, said he was 
surprised at the findings. He told The Times: ‘A lot of people think 
blue eyes are much rarer than they are.’

He
 said the colour may be more dominant because it is regarded as 
attractive, adding: ‘It may be that blue eyes are like the peacock’s 
tail. It doesn’t confer any evolutionary advantage … except that it gets
 him more mates.’

Blue-eyed
 Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman, Hugh 
Grant, Kate Winslet and Paul Newman all support the theory that blue 
eyes add to a person's sexual appeal.

Mr Moffat 
added: ‘All of them have inherited their eye colour …  through their 
DNA, and because of the way that blue eyes deal with light, they also 
appear to have inherited a natural sparkle.

Classic good looks: Paul Newman, pictured right in 1969 film Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and Daniel Craig both have blue eyes, which scientists think could be better for attracting mates than other colours

'Dark-coloured eyes … are able to absorb longer and shorter wavelengths and therefore they appear not to reflect [light].’ 

The
 researchers who carried out the study now aim to discover why the 
distribution of blue eyes varies so significantly across the UK.

The colour is the result of a variant in the HERC2 gene ‘switching off’ the melanin that forms brown eyes. People with green eyes have a combination of blue and brown variants.

The project’s Dr Jim Wilson said brown may overtake blue again, adding: ‘If rarity makes a feature more attractive then it could be that this process is reversed.’
