Stretching into the distance under grey skies, the only signs of life on this deserted Spanish highway are the occasional lone cyclist or pack of stray dogs.

The MP-203 in Madrid has remained unfinished for six years - despite initial investment of 70 million euro in the shelved project in recession-hit Spain.

Weeds can be seen growing on the surface of the abandoned route today, as it emerged the Eurozone has slumped into its longest recession ever.

Construction workers downed tools six years ago when the 12.5km route was 70 per cent complete, due to issues with the Madrid-Barcelona high speed railway and the connection to Spain's R-3 highway.

These images reveal how the project - intended to relieve congestion on the Barcelona highway (A-2) - has fallen into decline, on a day of further economic blows to the beleaguered Eurozone.

Figures showed economic activity 
across the region has fallen for the sixth quarter in a row - longer 
than the calamitous slump that hit the region in the financial crisis of
 2008-9.

Eurostat, the EU's statistics office,
 said today that nine of the 17 eurozone countries are in recession, 
with France a notable addition to the list.

Overall, the euro region's economy contracted 0.2 percent in the January-March period from the previous three months.

Though it represents an improvement 
on the previous quarter's 0.6 percent decline, it's another unwelcome 
landmark for the single currency bloc as it grapples with a debt crisis 
which has forced governments to slash spending and raise taxes.

These austerity measures have inflicted severe economic pain and social unrest.

Unemployment across the eurozone is 
currently at a record of 12.1 percent - in some countries, such as 
Greece, it's as high as 27.2 percent.

Though this recession is not nearly 
as deep as the one in 2008-9, it is the longest in the history of the 
euro, which was launched in 1999.

A recession is officially defined as 
two straight quarters of negative growth.
