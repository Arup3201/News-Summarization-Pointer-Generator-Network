A police force which calls crooks 'numpties' on its Facebook page and writes in a jokey manner about crime and criminals on its patch has won a huge following from local residents.

Despite criticism that the police force, which is having to cut its budget by £30m by 2016, could spend its time better by catching criminals rather than writing jokes about them, Surrey Police's Tandridge Beat has nearly 1,500 'likes' on its webpage.

The police have won a huge following thanks to their casual style and light-hearted posts about their force and its work in Surrey just south of the M25 near Godstone.

Surrey Police officers have gained a reputation for joking about criminals as 'numpties' on their Facebook page

Another day, another 'numpty': A post from Tandridge Beat earlier this month mentioned a hapless burglar

Police said this 'numpty' had only cleared a small patch of snow on his car's windscreen in March this year

One post, put up yesterday, reads: 'One of our more well-known numpties thought it would be a good idea to come to Lingfield and not pay for his fuel he needed for the stolen car he was in.

'Thanks to Metropolitan police, him and his friend were stopped and both arrested.'

Another post said: 'A numpty has left a calling card at a burglary in Tandridge... he will be enjoying our hospitality soon.  We will keep you updated.'

Local residents regularly check the page as much as for the jokes as the crime news.

One recent post read: 'They came, they stole, they got caught (all within 12 minutes).  If you can't afford meat, go vegetarian.  Don't nick it!!'

Delighted residents replied to the post positively, with one saying 'I saw them being carted off'.

There is a strong sense of community on 
the page, with one popular post recently reading: 'If the fella being a 
bit gobby at the Village on Caterham on the Hill on Sunday spoilt your 
day, don't worry, we spoilt his.

Community policing: One popular recent post gave an update on a lout who had urinated on a police van

Light-hearted banter: The jokes about local crooks keep coming on Tandridge Beat's Facebook page

'Charged him with being gobby and also damaging our van (what is it with blokes peeing where they aren't supposed to this week?)'

Fans of the Facebook page regularly joke with officers on the page, with one writing: 'Love the word numpties', and other replying to the post about the man stealing petrol with: 'Moral of the story: If you’re stupid enough to steal a car, be smart enough to afford the petrol! Hope I haven’t put any ideas in our local numpties heads!'

Tandridge police posted about their use of the word 'numpty, saying that they had checked that the word ‘wasn’t offensive’, and that they liked it.

They added: 'Especially after we checked it out properly and it doesn’t cross any "offensive" boundaries we have to be careful of.'

More than 1,400 people 'like' the Tandridge Beat Facebook page, and say they love the light-hearted tone

Popular community forum: Fans of the site have left messages on it saying the banter is good for police PR

According to the Urban Dictionary, a numpty is someone who ‘demonstrates a lack of knowledge of a particular subject or situation to the amusement of others’.

Police also use the Facebook page to post pictures of those breaking the law or not behaving responsibly.

In March, officers working for the force posted a photo of a snow-covered car driving along the road with just a tiny hole in the windscreen for the driver to look out of.

Their comment below said: 'With the snow falling, be safe and make sure you clear your car properly. Not like this numpty...it is dangerous for both you and for other road users.'

Other light-hearted postings include on April 26: 'Team Tandridge 4, Billy Burglar 0. This week 4 burglars have been arrested for 3 separate offences.'

And on April 26 one officer stated: 'Just putting the kettle on for another Billy Burglar nicked by Tandridge officers’.

The police Facebook page makes fun of local criminals and even those who report crime, as in this page

The officers who administer the police Facebook page even turn their hand to make up poems to deter crooks

It prompted comments from Gaynor Chapman, who wrote ‘Tea? No way. Water and maybe bread’, and Jane Clay who wrote ‘Make sure the water goes cold!’.

On May 3, the team posted a ditty after catching a string of men urinating in public, reading: 'If you need a pee, then take it from me, if you do it in the street, an officer on the beat, will say ‘Hey matey’, you will be fined eighty".'

Other postings joke of thieves being ‘slippery customers’ after stealing four barrels of cooking oil and saying that a female shoplifter who stole legs of lamb ‘maybe had a roast dinner every day’.

But Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said paying someone to administer the page was a waste of public money.

He said: 'When savings have to be found, staff time spent manning social media websites should be cut back.

'It's important that the force is open and accountable to local residents but funny stories on Facebook are not a priority right now.

'Taxpayers want their cash spent on bobbies out on the beat in their communities, not on staff stuck behind computer screens back at HQ.'

A source at Surrey Police said the Facebook page was ‘very popular’ - it has around 1,500 'likes' - adding: 'The team in Tandridge are known for their quirky sense of humour, but maybe this will come back to haunt them.

Police say they checked the word 'numpty' did not cross any 'offensive' boundaries that govern their web use

'You can just see some lawyer referring to the page and getting someone off with a charge because they were called a numpty or a Billy Burglar before it comes to court.'

Earlier this year Tandridge police were ordered to remove a photo they put on the Facebook page featuring an officer in a wendy house with a caption joking that the toy house was ‘the new extension to Lingfield police station’.

Chiefs at Surrey Police, which has to cut its budget by £30m by 2016, told the team to remove the photo and apologised for ‘causing any offence’.

A spokesman said at the time: 'Our Neighbourhood Policing Teams use their Facebook pages as a different way to engage with our local communities and will occasionally post pictures that are intended to be light-hearted.'

'The picture was not intended to cause any offence and has now been removed from the site.'

Earlier this year Surrey Police had to apologise after posting this picture and joking it was a new police station
