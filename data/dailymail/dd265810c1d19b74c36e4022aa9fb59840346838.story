A couple of lovestruck farmers said 'I moo' when they got married in a cow themed wedding.

Beef farmer Michael Hanson, 26, and surveyor Hayley Morgan, 31, decided they wanted to tie the knot in an 'udderly' brilliant style that celebrated their country lives.

The bride arrived at the church in a 2.8 tonne tractor which transported the happy couple after the service to a muddy field to have their portrait taken with a herd of British Blue cattle.

The couple even had cow and calf named tables at the reception and a British Blue themed wedding cake complete with icing figures of their three dogs and of them as cattle.

Guests' names were written on cattle ear tags on the tables and they enjoyed a four-course dinner with, what else, roast beef. 

The couple then honeymooned in Texas where they spent three weeks touring cattle farms.

After the wedding Hayley, from  Llandefalle, Powys in mid Wales, had to spend £95 cleaning the mud from her wedding dress, despite wearing a pair of white Wellington boots.

She said: 'We didn't want to pretend to be all prim and proper and not be ourselves on the day. We just wanted to be us and what we do every day.

'We met at a dinner and dance at Brecon Young Farmers in 2009 and everyone who was invited to the wedding was a farmer.

'I've never been to a wedding like ours but then we just wanted something that reflected us. It wasn't expensive, we just did it with the budget we had.

The tractor of love: Some arrive at their wedding in a Rolls-Royce, others in a horse and carriage, but for Hayley and Michael, a tractor was the obvious choice

'The marquee in the grounds of the farm had been up for about a month before. We had Michael's brother Johnny's 21st birthday in there and the local young farmers annual dinner.

'Everyone said how great it was and we are really glad we did it the way we wanted to.'

Hayley and Michael met and fell in love attending cattle shows, stock judging and at young farmers' events.

They have been on one date to the pub but admit they have never had a evening at the cinema.

They married in Hayley's parish church - St Matthews in Llandefalle - on August 20, having been together for two a half years.

After the wedding, they drove in the Massey Ferguson tractor to Hayley's parents' farm nearby to be pictured with the herd of British Blue cattle and their three-year-old terrier George.

Michael then drove the couple the 28 miles in a farm truck across the border to the reception at his family farm in Eardisland, Herefordshire, where they now live.

The couple headed to Hereford, Texas, the beef farming capital of the world, for their honeymoon.

Hayley said: 'We had a great time and relaxed but we learned a lot as well and it added to our education as farmers.

'We saw the intensive fed ranches where 100,000 cattle can live and how farmers in the U.S. operate.

'Mike joked to all his mates he was only taking me to Hereford for the honeymoon. Which of course he was, but the one in the U.S. thank goodness!'

They are planning to spend their wedding money gifts on a new herd of British Blue cattle.

Hayley also runs a part-time business from the farm selling rugs and accessories made from British hide, that retail at £500.

She said: 'I always wanted to run a cattle-related business and this is my passion. No one else in the country does British cowhide, I say buy British because you know the cow has had a good life then.'
