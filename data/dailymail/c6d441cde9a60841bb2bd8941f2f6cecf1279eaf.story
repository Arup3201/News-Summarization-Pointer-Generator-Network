The British nurse infected with ebola is responding well to treatment and has recovered his appetite, his parents told yesterday.

William Pooley, 29, is enjoying bacon butties and is now strong enough to start gentle exercise.

But he is still being kept inside an isolation tent and may have to stay there for weeks to ensure the infection does not spread. 

Feeling better: William Pooley, 29, is feeling much better eight days after arriving back from Sierra Leone

Mr Pooley was hailed a hero for his work treating ebola patients in a remote clinic in Sierra Leone after he was struck down with the disease. He was airlifted out of West Africa by the RAF and taken to the specialist isolation ward at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Last night his parents Robin, 67, and Jackie, 66, beamed with relief as they revealed their son is responding well to treatment, including the experimental drug ZMapp.

The couple, who have spent most of the last ten days at the hospital, praised the ‘world class’ care he had received.

Mr Pooley said: ‘He is able to get out of bed. He has a little step in there that the physio gave him so that he can rebuild his strength.

‘That in itself is a good enough sign, I think. But he seems to be pretty well actually.’

Unable to have any direct contact with his parents, Will is able to talk to them via a telephone link into the isolation tent. Mr Pooley added: ‘We can stand and see him indistinctly through the glass and the polythene.’

Mrs Pooley said: ‘He is talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He is interested in more things. 

And a clear sign of his improving health is his appetite.

Mr Pooley said: ‘His appetite has come back. It came back with a bacon butty that one morning for breakfast’.

Mrs Pooley added: ‘And then we took him a vegetable rogan josh [curry].’

The couple have revealed that they were at a family wedding when Will broke the news that he had been infected with ebola.

Mrs Pooley said: ‘We were at our niece’s wedding and he phoned, we’re out in the grounds and the photos were being taken. We assumed he’d phoned to wish his cousin every happiness.’ The phone was passed around family members, but his father thought Will was sounding ‘flat’ and that there was something wrong.

Fears: The volunteer nurse contracted Ebola while  treating patients in Africa where the disease has sprea

‘Fairly soon I rang him back and he told me,’ he said. ‘At which point the first thing in mind is, “We can’t spoil the day”.’ The couple left the wedding early.

Mrs Pooley said it was a ‘very stressful’ and anxious time when ‘all the worst case scenarios’ were running through her mind.

She said: ‘First of all we worried that he would not get out of the country. There a lot of check points that had to be cleared. He had 160 miles to travel across to get to the airport in Freetown.

‘It wasn’t until the plane had taken off that we breathed a very, very small sigh of relief, we knew he was on his way home.’

The couple say their son is very grateful for the expert case he has received.

Mrs Pooley said: ‘I think he has feels very glad to be having such good care. He is very aware of what he has left behind.’

Her husband added: ‘The fact that the British Government decided that they were going to be his insurance company was absolutely fantastic.’

The couple said they were very proud of Will for the live-saving work he did in Sierra Leone. They hope he will make a full recovery.

More than 1,500 people have died since the ebola outbreak started in Guinea. The World Health Organisation has warned as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is controlled.
