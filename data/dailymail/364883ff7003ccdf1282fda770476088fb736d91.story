Marvel-ous: Can you recognise some of these comic book heroes?

Another year, another LEGO game.

Following on from the critically-acclaimed LEGO The Lord of the Rings, TT Games are taking on the Marvel universe.

The game sees Nick Fury call upon Iron Man, the Hulk, 
Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine and other heroes to save Earth from Loki and Galactus, Devourer of the Worlds.

Although no details have been announced, Super Heroes will be released sometime around autumn 2013, and available across all current generation consoles.

As per usual, expect the game to look its best on the PC, with the Wii U, Xbox 360 and PS3 versions coming a close second.

Gameplay is likely to be a familiar formula of puzzles and platforming elements, with level design tailored for cooperative play.

Puzzles will no doubt make the most of each character's individual powers - whether that be Iron Man's blasters or the Hulk's brute strength.

Hit in the making: Expect to be able to play as all of your favourite superheroes from the Marvel universe

'Weâ€™re very excited to bring a myriad of 
classic Marvel characters to life in LEGO form for some fun, 
family-friendly gameplay in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,' said Tom Stone, 
Managing Director of TT Games Publishing.

'Players will brave the ultimate
mission to save the world as they explore famous landmarks in LEGO New 
York and take the adventure beyond Earth to iconic locations in the 
Marvel Universe.'
