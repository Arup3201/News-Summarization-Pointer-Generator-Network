Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay has revealed the club is talking to former Manchester United boss David Moyes about their managerial vacancy.

Moyes has been without a club since leaving Old Trafford in April last season, but has not been short of suitors. Now, Spanish club Sociedad are attempting to lure the 51-year-old to La Liga.

Aperribay said: 'There are several names, and it is true those of (Pepe) Mel and Moyes.'

Real Sociedad sacked their manager Jagoba Arrasate after Sociedad won just one of their first 10 games

The Basque club are considering four coaches to replace Jagoba Arrasate, who was fired on Sunday after just one victory in the team's first 10 league games.

'We are trying to get to know each of the four people we are negotiating with,' said Apperribay. 

Existing coaches Asier Santana and Imanol Alguacil will take charge for Sunday's home game against defending champions Atletico Madrid.

Sociedad finished fourth in La Liga two seasons ago but their participation in the Champions League affected their domestic form, leading to a seventh-placed finish in 2013-14. Their decline has continued again this season with The Royals currently sitting second from bottom with just six points.

Were Moyes to take the job, some fans might be surprised, but the club have a history of appointing British managers. Chris Coleman took charge of the then-second division side in 2007, John Toshack managed the club in three separate spells (1985-89, 1991-94, 2001-02), while Harry Lowe led the club between 1930-35.

Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935

Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century.

He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966.

John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final.

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season.

Chris Coleman, 2007-2008

After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.
