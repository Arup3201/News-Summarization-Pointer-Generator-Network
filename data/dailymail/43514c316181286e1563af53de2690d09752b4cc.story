Within hours of the Philippines arrest of an Australian convert to Islam who used the internet to urge people to join 'jihad', a Facebook page calling for his release hit the social media site.

Robert Edward Cerantonio, 29, who also goes by the name Musa Cerantonio, was detained on Friday in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he is believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming he had arrived in the Middle East just days before.

The region's deputy police chief, Superintendent Conrado Capa, said Cerantonio would be deported to Australia.

A Facebook page calling for Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio's release has emerged

It has more than 1,500 likes so far since it was created on Friday and contains messages of support

Followers of the Melbourne-born jihadist, who is one of extremist group Islamic State's most prolific members urging people to join them in Iraq and Syria, have used the page to post messages of support for Cerantonio. The Abbott Government earlier this week listed Islamic State as a terrorist organisation when it pushed through amendments to the criminal code.

Created on the same day as the jihadist's arrest, the Release Brother Musa Cerantonio page has attracted more than 1,500 likes and calls for Filipino authorities to free 'the man who opened our mind and dig the very root of jihad in the Philippines and All of the Muslim Lands'.

One supporter wrote: 'I love him so much, may Allah help and protect him always, he was chosen by Allah...stay strong bro'.

'May he be protected by ALLAH in all matters. He has the knowledge and courage given by ALLAH to tell the truth about ISLAM...,' another wrote on the page.

Musa Cerantonio was arrested by local police in the Philippines on Friday, days after he claimed on Twitter he was on the way to the Middle East

In a telephone interview on Friday, Supt Capa told AAP that Cerantonio had 'been in Cebu since February... For the most part, he keeps to himself in his rooms, in hotels or apartments'.

'In one broadcast on his website, he called on brother Muslims to join the war in Iraq and Syria.'

Supt Capa said Cerantonio was arrested and would be deported because the Australian government cancelled his passport, making him an illegal alien.

However, Mr Banas said there is 'no evidence linking him to any terror act'.

His arrest comes more than a week after he tweeted on social media he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers of the Islamic State - which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter.

Two days before that he tweeted: 'Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel.'

Al-Hamdulillah means 'Thanks and Praise to God' in Arabic, Insha'Allah translates to 'God-willing', Ash-Sham refers to the Levant and the term du'a is used for the word 'prayers'.

The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the arrest of the 29-year-old but will neither confirm nor deny whether they are conducting their own investigation.

'The AFP is aware that Philippine authorities have taken action in relation to Musa Cerantonio, which may result in his return to Australia,' the AFP said in a statement.

A federal government spokeswoman said she was aware Cerantonio had been detained but would not comment further.

Head bowed, the Islamic State member was found in the southern region of Mindanao - a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency

Just over a week ago, Cerantonio tweeted he was in the Middle East

The Philippines has a large Muslim minority in the southern region of Mindanao, a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency and where Islamic militants linked to al-Qaeda also operate.

Police said they had been monitoring Cerantonio's activities since February when he arrived in Cebu, the country's largest metropolis outside Manila.

'We cannot say with certainty that he had any contact with local Muslim groups,' Supt Capa said, adding the Australian had been living with a Filipino woman and moving periodically around Cebu until his arrest at a one-room apartment near the airport.

The 32-year-old woman -Â  who bought food and other supplies for Cerantonio - was wanted by police over an unrelated fraud case and was also arrested on Friday, he added.

A police intelligence officer involved in the operation said Cerantonio had been in Mindanao, though there was no indication he had tried to recruit Filipinos or been in contact with Islamic militants in the area.

'This person... has a website and he propagates extreme teachings and advocates jihad and calling on Muslim brothers to go to Syria and Iraq to fight together with the ISIS,' the official said, referring to the Islamic State militants who have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq.

Cerantonio is expected to be deported back to Australia

Cerantonio, a Melbourne native, 'is a convert from Christianity', the intelligence officer said.

'Sometimes he mentions the Philippine government (on his website), but does not call for violence' against it, the officer added, adding that the Australian has 'no overt following' in the Philippines.

Television footage aired by the ABS-CBN network showed a bearded Caucasian man in a white robe being ushered out of an apartment by officers wearing helmets and flak jackets.

A report in The Australian newspaper in June described Cerantonio as a preacher and 'one of (the Islamic State's) most influential propagandists', and that Australian police were planning to move against him.

The newspaper said Cerantonio called for the assassination of Western leaders in a Facebook post in December, and that a study had found one in four foreign fighters in Syria followed his Twitter account.

Recently, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented that the government will do everything it can to ensure Australians don't become radicalised overseas and bring their extremist views back home.

Ms Bishop refused to comment specifically about Cerantonio to avoid jeopardising the work of Philippine authorities, but she said reports of Australian citizens getting involved with radicals and fighting overseas were disturbing.

'We are determined to ensure that Australians do not leave this country to take up fighting in another country, become radicalised and then return to Australia with these new skills and extremist outlooks,' she told reporters in Brisbane.

'We are taking every step we can to ensure that Australians are kept safe.'
