Comedian Bobby Davro is at the centre of a bizarre divorce row after his friend’s wife flashed her breasts at him during an alcohol-fuelled internet video call.

The comic’s friendship with Marianne Dobson is said to have devastated her husband, former TV magician Wayne Dobson, who is now divorcing his wife of seven years.

When Mr Dobson confronted his friend about the incident on Skype, which allows users to make video calls over the internet, the comic said: ‘It’s no big deal.’

It is thought their friendship has since soured.

Davro and Mr Dobson, 57, became friends 30 years ago when they both enjoyed successful TV careers.

Davro’s clean-cut routines made him a household name in the 1980s, while Mr Dobson’s Saturday night ITV programme, Wayne Dobson – A Kind of Magic with Linda Lusardi, attracted up to 11million viewers in the 1990s.

Davro, 56, who lives with his ex-wife Trudi Jameson, a former topless model, yesterday claimed his relationship with Mrs Dobson was an innocent friendship.

He told The Sun: ‘I have spent time with Marianne on my own, I gave her lifts. I’m very fond of Marianne Dobson, I’m very fond of her husband.’

He said he regretted doing ‘something silly’ but said that the incident had nothing to do with the breakdown of the Dobsons’ marriage.

Wayne Dobson was a star of Saturday night television in the 1980s with his hit show A Kind Of Magic, but was forced to quit in the 1990s after developing MS. He and wife Marianne married in 2005 after meeting in hospital

He said: ‘The incident has no relevance on my friends’ split and I was terribly sad to see it happen, especially for my friend Wayne.’ Mr Dobson was forced to reduce his workload as a magician after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988, which has confined him to a wheelchair.

He met his wife when he was receiving treatment in hospital. They wed in 2005 and lived in Haslemere, Surrey.

Speaking about the incident on Skype, Mrs Dobson, 54, told the Sun: ‘I think we were both really drunk. He [Davro] is just as big a culprit in this too. He is no longer a friend now.’

She blamed the marriage split on her husband’s illness, saying: ‘I could no longer cope with Wayne’s disability. I’ve had breast cancer myself which I’ve just got over.’

Davro had a run of hit Saturday night programmes on ITV including Bobby Davro on The Box, Bobby’s Sketch Pad and TV Weekly.

More recently, he appeared in EastEnders as Vinnie Monks in 2008.

Davro hit the headlines earlier this year when he performed at Cherie Blair’s 60th birthday party. 

He usually charges up to £4,000 for public appearances, but waived the fee as a favour for mutual friend Stephen Purdew, owner of Champneys health spa.
