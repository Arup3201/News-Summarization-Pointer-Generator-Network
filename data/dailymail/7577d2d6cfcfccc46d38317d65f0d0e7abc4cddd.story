A woman accused of killing a British student after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone has gone on trial accused of murder in America.

Claudia Aderotimi died in 2011 after travelling from her home in London to Philadelphia to have silicone injections because she wanted a bigger bottom.

But Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, is accused of using a mix of industrial-grade silicone and glue that spread to Ms Aderotimi's brain and lungs, causing heart failure and killing her.

Charged: Windslowe is accused of killing British student Claudia Aderotimi after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone that caused heart failure

Tragic: Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in February 2011 after receiving a silicone injection in her buttocks in her pursuit of a bigger bottom

Accused: Though she had no medical training, Windslowe (above) would charge up to £1,200 per injection

Windslowe - a transgender rapper known as 'Black Madam' - is now on trial for third-degree murder in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court.

Ms Aderotimi, 20, believed a 'bigger booty' would help her appear in more music videos and further her career as a dancer.

The Thames Valley University student developed chest pains and struggled for breath 12 hours after she had the illegal injections at a budget hotel. She was rushed to hospital but could not be saved.

An examination found the silicone filler had leaked into her bloodstream, leading to heart failure.

It is believed Windslowe treated her with cheap ‘industrial’ silicone, normally used as a sealant, rather than medical-grade material used in breast implant surgery.

Windslowe, who does not have an injecting license, then allegedly closed the wounds with glue and cotton balls.

When Ms Aderotimi complained of chest 
pains, Windslowe allegedly told her to drink more fluids and to call an 
ambulance if needed.

At the pre-trial hearing, Windslowe boasted of the quality of her work and told the judge; 'I am the Michelangelo of buttocks injections...A lot of people came to me. My work spoke for itself.'

Police say that Windslowe fled the hotel room after Aderotimi started having trouble breathing during 'a touch-up,' which was intended as part of her birthday celebrations.

Unlicensed: Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer

A coroner has testified that the industrial-grade silicone spread to her lungs and brain and caused a pulmonary embolism.

Though she had no medical training, Windslow would charge clients up to £1,200 per injection. 

The hearing was held to discuss the defence's request to have the trial aborted as one of the prosecution's key witnesses has stated she will not travel from London to Philadelphia to testify.

Theresa Gyamfi was present on February 11, 2011, when Claudia Aderotimi allegedly received a silicone injection in her buttocks from Windslowe. 

The judge ruled that Gyamfi's testimony from a 2012 preliminary hearing could be read to the jury. 

Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave exotic dancer Shurkia King at another 'pumping party'. 

King was admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing and vomiting blood after receiving an injection.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Windslowe flirted with Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega and then 'cooed' at her attorney, David S. Rudenstein and said:  'I'm very happy with you, Mr. Rudenstein. You made my day a delight.'

Rudenstein replied: 'Well, that's good.' 

The trial will resume on Monday.
