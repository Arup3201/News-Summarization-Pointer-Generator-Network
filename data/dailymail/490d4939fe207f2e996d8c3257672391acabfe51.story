The Danish man who claims he worked with the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda and helped take out radical anti-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, had a lesser-known job: matchmaker to the terrorists.

Morton Storm, a Danish convert to Islam, was a trusted al-Qaeda associate when he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife for Awlaki - who already had two - in an effort to track him down.

To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki.

He then orchestrated an exchange of previously unseen video messages between the two, and - despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to marry.

But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted.

Morten Storm has come forward to claim that he was an al-Qaeda double agent and helped the CIA track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a top figure in the terror group

Made for each other? Storm says he conducted an exchange of videos between Awlaki and Aminah, in which they talked about her becoming his third wife

The CIA plan, Morton says, was to 
plant a tracking device on Aminah's luggage when she came to Yemen to 
meet her new husband - which would lead the agency directly to Awlaki's hideout.

In a video appearing on the 
site of Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, she said: 'I would go with him anywhere. I am 32 
years old and I am ready for dangerous things. Iâ€™m not afraid of death 
or to die in the sake of Allah.'

Croatian Aminah, who used to work with disabled children in Zagreb, also adds: 'I feel nervous. This is very awkward for me. I just taped this so you can see how I look.'

In his reply, Awlaki - who had specifically requested a white Muslim convert to be his 'companion in hiding' - said: 'If you 
can live in difficult conditions, do not mind loneliness and can live 
with restrictions on your communication with others, then that is 
great.'

He also mentions an associate, purported to be Storm, saying: 'The brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother.'

The pair exchanged encrypted video messages, with Awlaki saying in one: 'I currently do not live in a tent, but in a house [that] belongs to a friend. I'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time. I prefer this residence [to] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read, write and research.'

At a meeting in Vienna, Austria, Storm showed 
Aminah a video recording made by Awlaki, who was dressed in 
white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif.

In it he says: 'This recording is 
done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request. I pray Allah 
guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. 
And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this 
proposal.'

Storm said Aminah burst into tears when after watching the video.

In videos she sent to Awlaki, wearing a headscarf, she says: 'I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen 
and inshallah Allah will help us.'

In another, with the headscarf removed, she says: 'Brother, it's me without the scarf, so you can see my 
hair. I hope you are happy with me, inshallah.'

The CIA and Storm both knew the 
dangers of the mission meant there was a risk Aminah would be killed, 
but were content to continue in their bid to track Awlaki.

And during another trip to Vienna, Storm bought Aminah her plane ticket and gave her $3,000 from Awlaki. She and the bugged suitcase arrived in Sanaa as planned and Storm received a text from the CIA saying 'Congratulations brother, you just got rich, very rich'.

He was handed a briefcase just outside Copenhagen, Denmark, containing $250,000. When he asked the combination for the lock, he was told simply: 'Try 007.'

But the plan to plant a tracking device on Aminah collapsed when she was contacted by al-Qaeda operatives, who told the woman to ditch
 her suitcase before meeting Awlaki.

Dead: Anwar al-Awlaki (left and right) was killed in a
 drone attack in Yemen in September 2011 - Morten Storm claims it was 
directly helped by him

While the plan for Aminah to lead the U.S. to Awlaki failed, the marriage ended up working out.

But their bond was cut short when Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike on September 30, 2011.

But Aminah has reportedly taken up 
her husband's cause, writing for the online terror magazine Inspire, 
which famously included the article, 'How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen
 of Your Mom.'

She also told al-Qaeda leaders that she would carry out a suicide mission in an act of revenge, but she was told not to.

Storm, who has come forward to Danish
 newspaper Jyllands-Posten, has said that he was a former Islamic 
supremacist before the Danish intelligence service PET convinced him to 
change sides and work for them and eventually the American CIA.

Storm has claimed that he became so 
deeply trusted by Anwar al-Awlaki that President Obama knew his name 
and that it was him who delivered a USB stick the Americans used to 
track al-Awlaki to the convoy that they destroyed in Yemen in September 
2011.

In a statement issued in response to 
the story, the Danish spy organisation said that as a matter of policy 
it does not publicly confirm sensitive information about its past, 
current or future operations, nor does it deny incorrect information.

Three peas in a pod? President Obama and Defense Secretary and former CIA boss Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm's existence

The CIA and the White House have not commented on Storm's role in the death of al-Awlaki.

Storm told Jyllands-Posten that he suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime.

In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran.

He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama.

According
 to the newspaper report, in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained 
change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence 
service, PET.

After 
five years, Storm claimed to have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda 
in the Arabian Peninsula's inner circle and gained direct access to 
al-Awlaki.

Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, 
had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the
 Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding.

Before his death, he was believed to 
be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk 
Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to 
use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009.

He also played a role in the 2009
 Fort Hood massacre and the failed plot by Faisal Shahzad to detonate 
an SUV filled with explosives on May 1, 2010.
