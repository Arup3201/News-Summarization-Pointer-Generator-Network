While most Brits have been reveling in the last of the Indian summer, it's not looking so bright for high-street retailers.

British retailer Next warned today that it will have to lower profit forecasts if unusually warm autumn weather continues and shoppers don't buy winter clothing, denting shares across the sector.

Shares in Next, Britain's second biggest clothing retailer by sales, fell as much as 5.6 per cent.

Warning: Next has warned  that it will have to lower profit forecasts if unusually warm autumn weather continues and shoppers don't buy winter clothing

Shares in Marks & Spencer, the country's largest clothing retailer, declined by up to 4.4 per cent, while department store Debenhams were down by up to 4.7 per cent.

The comments had extra resonance coming from Next, which has outperformed rivals for a decade due to a strong online presence, new store openings and diversification into new product areas, such as homewares, as well as new overseas markets.

In July the company, whose current poster girl is Kendra Spears, a.k.a. Princess Salwa Aga Khan, raised its guidance for annual sales and profit for the second time in three months. 

'Next don't often lower guidance, so the fact that they have said they may do so due to the warmer weather is hitting the shares, which have had a strong run, and will also hit the sector if the weather remains unseasonal," said Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar.

September is on course to be the driest since records began in 1910, according to Britain's Met Office.

Next's warning comes less than two weeks after the employee-owned John Lewis, Britain's largest department store chain, became the first major UK retailer to say shoppers were delaying purchases of winter coats, hats and boots because of unseasonably warm and dry weather.

Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz, more commonly known as H&M, the world's second biggest fashion retailer, issued a similar statement last week.

M&S said it had no plans to change its trading update schedule. It is next due to update investors on how it is faring on November 5.

'Next are probably being unnecessarily cautious, ahead of investor meetings this week, but the market is unlikely to take any chances and the shares will be unnerved,' said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. 

Next, which trades from over 500 stores in Britain and Ireland, about 200 stores overseas, and through its Directory internet and catalogue business, said third quarter sales to date were up 6 percent - lower than its previous forecast of up 10 percent.

'Cooler weather in August resulted in several very strong weeks. However, warmer weather in the more important month of September has had the reverse effect,' it said.

Next said that, at present, its profit forecast for the full 2014-15 year remains within its previous guidance range of £775-£815m ($1.26-$1.32 billion), given on July 29 and reiterated on Sept. 11.

'Our experience suggests that some lost sales are regained when the weather turns. However, if this unusually warm weather continues for the full duration of October then we are likely to lower our full year profit guidance range,' it said.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Freddie George added: 'The mild weather...is impacting all retailers in the UK and is only a temporary phenomenon. The underlying trends, in our view, remain positive.'

Shares in Next, up 36 percent over the last year, were down 265 pence or 3.8 percent at 6,600 pence at 0905 GMT, valuing the business at around 10 billion pounds. (1 US dollar = 0.6153 British pound)
