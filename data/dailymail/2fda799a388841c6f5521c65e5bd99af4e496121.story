Jailed: Clerk Debabish Majumber outside Kingston Crown Court, where he received a suspended jail sentence for looking at porn during a rape case

A ‘bored’ court clerk who was caught watching porn by a judge during a rape trial has been spared jail.

Debasish Majumder, 54, sat casually viewing explicit online material while a sex attack victim gave evidence at Inner London Crown Court. 

Majumder, from Haringey, north London, who had been working for the 
courts service for 27 years, confessed to routinely watching 
internet porn when he was bored.

‘I only looked at porn because the case 
was boring and did so once or twice a week since December 2009,’ he said
 in his police interview.

He was spotted by Judge Nigel Seed QC viewing the footage, and he subsequently reported the incident.

Detectives then found indecent pseudo images of children and extreme porn on his home computer.

Kingston Crown Court heard the married 
father-of-one made a series of porn searches during the rape trial in early December 2010.

He also looked at non-sexual material with no relevance to his work.

Sentencing Majumder to seven months in 
prison, suspended for two years, Judge Nicholas Price QC said: ‘I’m told
 by your counsel that you didn’t think anyone could see what you were 
doing - you were wrong.

'The learned judge conducting the trial saw very 
clearly what you did. 

‘It’s incomprehensible that a man of 
your age and experience should behave in such an appalling way. It is 
inexcusable and reprehensible and you have no one to blame but yourself.

‘The very fact there are no comparable cases shows how rare, if not unique your case must be.

‘You have lost almost everything 
including your job, your good name and the probable consequences are you
 will find it almost impossible to find another form of employment.

‘You have brought shame upon yourself, your wholly innocent wife and your son.

‘But at 54, with a hitherto unblemished record, you have built up a credit balance and you are entitled to withdraw from that.’

Majunder was caught watching porn during a rape trial at Inner London Court

Prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the 
court how Judge Seed noticed ‘cartoon-like’ images on his clerk’s 
computer but was unable to ascertain whether they were sexual.

‘I think it was farm yard animals but if it was pornographic I couldn’t tell,’ the judge said in a statement.

‘Later I could see he was looking at a list of pornographic websites and I was shocked.’

The judge also said he saw an image of a woman with blonde hair performing a sex act on a man.

‘I watched him on Friday to see if I was mistaken. I looked down at his computer screen and again saw a list of websites.

‘I decided that was enough, I was not mistaken.’

Defending, Susannah Stephens said: 
‘These are images that people view perfectly lawfully in a number of 
different environments and it’s right to say that Mr Majumder was of the
 belief that no one else would be able to see what he was doing.

‘He had no knowledge the judge would be 
able to see, he thought in light of where he was sitting that he would 
block the judge’s view of the screen and what he was looking at would be
 too small for the judge to see.

‘He accepts fully that what he did amounts to misconduct.

‘Prior to this, there wasn’t a single blemish on his record.’

Majumder admitted a single count of misconduct in public office, seven counts of possessing indecent pseudo images of children and an additional count of possessing extreme pornography. 

He will now be supervised for 18 months and must sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.

His computer usage will also be monitored and he will be subject to a sex offender’s prevention order for five years.
