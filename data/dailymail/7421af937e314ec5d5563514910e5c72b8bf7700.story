Nancy's in the house:  Martin Short lost Nancy, his wife of 36 years, to ovarian cancer in 2010, but she is very much a presence in his life

Topper: Short compares his life to the 1930’s film comedy Topper, played by Roland Young who was cheerily haunted by the ghosts of two deceased friends, a fun-loving couple played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett

‘I’m still very much married to Nancy’, says Short, 64,  who got his start on SCTV and Saturday Night Live,

He’s not ready to forget, move on, or be fixed up with women for companionship. Nancy’s in the house.

Short compares his life to the 1930’s film comedy Topper, played by Roland Young who was cheerily haunted by the ghosts of two deceased friends, a fun-loving couple played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.

‘In my case, it’s Nancy with whom I happily converse, even while the rest of the world can’t see her’.

‘In our thirty-six years together we became so intimately familiar with the workings of each other’s minds that I can convincingly play out the conversations we would be having today, about things that postdate Nancy’s death, -- the continued adventures of our three kids, the arrival of HRH Prince George of Cambridge, the Chris Christie ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, and such curiosities as twerking, Ted Cruz…..’

Martin has the sense that ‘Nancy has only slipped away into the next room’.

Funnyman: Martin as Saturday Night Live fan favorite Ed Grimley during "Hospital" skit in 1985. He originated the character for Toronto's Second City comedy troop

‘So some night, when I’m really missing her, I’ll grab a rum and Coke at twilight and sit on the couch on our front porch, or perhaps upstairs, on the balcony off of our bedroom, with the Pacific Ocean in view’.

‘I’ll call out, ‘Hey, Nan’! Forming the words just feels good in the throat’.

Or he does something they always did in the car when Nancy would say ‘Hand of a hand’, which was a cue for Martin to put his right hand in her left. ‘Kiss the hand’, he’d say and she would lift it to her lips and kiss it.

‘I still offer my hand to Nancy – it’s how I initiate our conversations’.

‘These, our talks, go on internally, not out loud. You won’t find me sitting out there chattering away, switching seats, schizophrenically playacting both parts. ‘But we do talk, Nancy and I, and I can totally hear where she agrees with me and where she disagrees’.

Short, Canadian-born, met Nancy Dolman during the Toronto production of the musical Godspell when she stepped in as Gilda Radner’s understudy.

At the time, Short was involved in an on-and-off relationship for two years with the mercurial and darkly neurotic Radner when he met Nancy.

That relationship ended in July 1974.

Having a drink at his favorite watering hole in Toronto, Nancy walked in and they fell into each other’s arms forever after. They were married six years later, in 1980.

The actor lost both parents and his brother by the time he was 20 and from that tragedy, he was able to find some optimism within.

He had what felt like a visitation after the family deaths that fulfilled a need for closure at the time.

‘Something terrible can happen to you, and yet, the day after this something terrible, the sun still rises, and life goes on. And therefore, so must you’, he writes.

He believes he became adept at keeping people alive who have passed after losing his parents and brother so early.

‘I think this is healthy. I can’t stand when the dead are talked about in hushed tones or banished from our thoughts’.

Everlasting love: Martin has the sense that ‘Nancy has only slipped away into the next room’.  He was dating Gilda Radner when he met Nancy in Toronto, who stepped in as Gilda's understudy

The conversation with Nancy continues:

‘Nan, can you believe that you’ve been gone for four years’?

‘Has it been that long’?

‘Absolutely’.

‘Are you having a cocktail, baby’?

‘I sure am’.

‘Is that your first’?

‘It sure isn’t. And it may not be my last. So judge not’!

‘Hey, I don’t judge’.

‘Yeah, right’.

‘Aren’t you a happy boy’!

(The cocktail glass is refilled.)

‘Nan’?

‘Ya, Mart’?

‘Where’d you go’?

There was no answer this time because he asked the unanswerable. And he wasn’t expecting an answer.

‘There’s still life to be lived, laughs to be had, children to cherish, dear friends to be gossiped about, and costars to be upstaged’, Short writes.

‘As for the grander questions, their answers will surely reveal themselves’.

Short’s acting credits include: !Three Amigos!, Father of the Bridge, TV’s Damages, numerous talk-show, prime-time and theatrical appearances and his one-man Broadway hit Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me.
