Jeff Bauman has returned to his job at Costco 14 months after he lost both of his legs in the Boston marathon bombings.

In a post on his Facebook page, the 28-year-old is pictured wearing a name tag and smiling alongside two colleagues as he stands behind a cash register while lightly holding his crutches.

A caption on the photo, which was posted on Wednesday evening, reads: 'Jeffrey back at work today! W/Mike & Maya @#Costco!'

It is not clear if Bauman has returned full-time to the Nashua, New Hampshire store, where he worked for three years before the bombings - but well-wishers on the page congratulated him on his return.

'Was thrilled to see Jeff back to work!' one wrote alongside the picture. 'Big smiles throughout Costco on the faces of all the employees as well as the members! Welcome back, Jeff!!!'

Bauman was at the Boston Marathon last year to cheer along his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, and was standing near the finish line when the bombs exploded, killing three people and injuring hundreds.

In a now-iconic image, an ashen-faced Bauman was photographed being wheeled to medical attention by three rescuers - including 'the man in the Cowboy hat', Carlos Arredondo.

As well as losing his legs, Bauman suffered black eyes and cuts, second degree burns to his back, burns around his eyes and both eardrums had ruptured.

After the bombings, Bauman underwent 
multiple surgeries and was fitted with often-painful prosthetics as he 
slowly learned to walk again - and became a key witness for the FBI as 
he remembered seeing one of the Boston bombers before the explosions.

In another show of his progress, last month he also shared a photograph to the Facebook page of him driving Arredondo on Memorial Day.

In a book he released earlier this year, 'Stronger', he credits his family and colleagues with saving his emotional health, but in particular, he credits his girlfriend Erin with getting him through.

The couple became engaged in February and are expecting their first child on July 14.

'I tend to think tragedy gives you perspective,' he wrote. 'Who can I be honest with, without being afraid of their reaction? The answer always came up Erin.'

He also fostered a close relationship with Arredondo, who attended sports games with him and often visited him in hospital.

The men were side-by-side at the finishing line of this year's Boston Marathon - and last month, they were both given honorary degrees from Fisher College, where they delivered this year's commencement speech.

Arredondo and his wife lost both of their sons - one to a sniper in Iraq and the other to suicide - and have said that the bombings have allowed them a second chance at family.

'Jeff and Erin, they fill a place - they never could never replace Alex or Brian - but having them in our lives eases things,' Melida Arredondo said. 'It helps, and we just enjoy spending time together.'  

MailOnline has reached out to Bauman's spokesperson for more information about his return to Costco.
