A 43-year-old woman has jumped to her death in Manhattan after reportedly drinking and getting into a fight with her mother.

Yee-Ping Yang, 43, threw herself from the 18th floor balcony of her home in Trump Palace on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

A dispute between mother, Mu-Hsiang Chow, and her daughter took place shortly before 2am on Wednesday at their home, according to the NYPD.

Police sources told the New York Post that during the confrontation Ms Yang threatened to jump off the balcony if her mother left the condo.

When Ms Chow went to the front door, Ms Yang rushed to the edge of the balcony and jumped over.

She fell to her death. Her body was recovered from a ninth-floor balcony.

Trump Palace on the Upper East Side, where apartments go for around $15million, has 55 floors and offers a luxurious standard of living with a marble lobby, gardens and health club.

In a separate incident, a 76-year-old woman jumped from the 18th floor of a building on East 86th Street in Manhattan at 8.30am and landed in a courtyard below. Her name has not been released.
