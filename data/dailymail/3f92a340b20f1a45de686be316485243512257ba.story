A man who played one of the dancing hamsters in the Kia car commercials and was a backing dancer for Madonna has been charged with disability fraud.

The California Department of Insurance says 27-year-old Leroy Barnes of Los Angeles collected $51,000 in workers compensation benefits between 2010 and 2011.

He was arrested last month and is currently freed on bail.

Barnes played one of the hamsters in at least one Kia commercial during the time he was claiming the benefit

In June 2010, the 27-year-old was struck by a piece of ceiling that fell on him during a sound check, when employed as a dancer for John Cossette Productions.

He received state disability insurance benefits from September 2010 to September 2011, amounting to more than $51,000.

Barnes told doctors that he was not employed during the time he was receiving the benefits, however, detectives discovered evidence that he was actually working while receiving the money.

According to the Californian Department for Insurance during this time he made at least one commercial for Kia, as one of the dancing hamsters.

They also add that he performed in a rap group, assisted in the recording of the song 'Cat Daddy' under the alias MoWii with rap group The Rej3ctz.

He was a backing dancer for popstars such as Madonna, Kelly Rowland and Chris Brown and worked under the name of Hypnosis.

Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said: 'Fraudulently collecting disability benefits is not only illegal, it disrespects legitimately injured Californians who are unable to work.'

Barnes could not be reached for comment and it is not known if he has a lawyer.
