QPR are in talks over a £1million deal for Liverpool defender Jack Robinson and are hopeful over reaching agreement with midfielder Lassana Diarra.

Robinson, 20, was a loan target for Championship sides but travelled to London for discussions on Monday night after Liverpool accepted QPR's offer.

Former Portsmouth and Chelsea midfielder Diarra, 29, has left Lokomotiv Moscow following a dispute with coach Leonid Kuchuk which culminated in the France international refusing to turn up for training.
