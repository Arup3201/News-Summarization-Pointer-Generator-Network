Hoax UFO videos have a tried and tested format: shaky footage, a bogus spaceship and cries of wonder from the person filming on a smartphone.

But one Hollywood animator has gone the extra mile to produce a convincing UFO 'gag' which is entirely created with CGI effects - including the car, the skies and the scenery.

Canadian Aristomenis Tsirbas, who has worked on Titanic, Hellboy and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created a short clip which appears to show a UFO flying over Santa Clarita, California, seen from a moving vehicle.

Hoax: The car, the skies and the scenery are all the product of CGI effects, as well as the apparent UFO

Tsirbas said the sci fi effects, such as the UFO and the mothership, were easier to create than the scenery

The video seems to show a car driving through a desert at sunset when a dark, flat, latticed object flies overhead.

The driver can be heard muttering 'Woah', before getting out of the car in the breeze to get a better shot of the apparent UFO.

It hovers around some pylons before a 'mothership' appears from nowhere, collects the UFO and vanishes, at which the driver says: 'Holy...'

Tsirbas, who spent four months 
creating the 30 second clip, said he wanted to play a joke to prove to 
critics of CGI that the effects can look realistic.

The 45-year-old director told Wired: 'The point of the video was to prove that CGI can look natural and 
convincing.

'Everybody assumes the background and 
car are real, and that the UFOs are probably fake, especially the 
over-the-top mothership at the end.

Tsirbas described the mothership as being 'over-the-top' but deliberately made the video shaky to seem more realistic

'The general reaction is disbelief, 
so I usually have to prove it by showing a wire frame of the entire shot 
to prove that nothing is real.'

Tsirbas said the 'real' elements to the film were the most difficult to create convincingly. The Los Angeles-based director said: 'Without a doubt the real stuff was the toughest because everybody 
knows what an actual car driving down a desert should look like.

'Getting it mostly right wasn’t good 
enough. We had to nail the car and desert perfectly, otherwise the gag 
wouldn’t work.

Getting the car, the scenery and the exposure right was vital to making the video realistic

Even the scenery was completely computer generated for the 30-second UFO hoax clip

The exposure was made to look imperfect in order to mimic the settings on an ordinary smartphone

'Often CGI is too perfectly and uniformly exposed, when reality has 
things blowing out or falling into darkness all over the place.

'The car interior was a beautiful model,
 but I deliberately crunched down that element in the composite until it
 was almost entirely black, because a real camera would do the same if 
exposing for the sky.'

Tsirbas worked on the hoax with students from the Gnomon School of Visual Effects, where he taught filmmaking classes and served as resident director of an original content division called Gnomon Studios.
