The musician who police suspect supplied the heroin that killed Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman has said he feels like he has been made a scapegoat for his death.

Speaking to the New York Times against the advice of his lawyer, Robert Aaron, 57, said that a witch hunt is going on because authorities are under pressure to prosecute someone for Hoffman's death in early February.

Labeling himself a 'human sacrifice', the multi-instrumentalist who has played with David Bowie and Wycleff Jean said that he is 'unlucky' to have been singled out by police.

Canadian-born Aaron, who faces up to 25-years if he is found guilty of possession and supplying heroin to the tragic actor, was the subject of a sympathetic report in which he revealed his battles with the drug.

Outlining an on-off habit for the best part of 40-years, Aaron said that he will not apologize for his drug use as no one has been hurt by it.

'Honestly, I don’t think anybody I know romanticized it as much as they liked it. It’s got good qualities,' said Aaron to The New York Times.

Arrested in his Manhattan apartment two nights after Hoffman was discovered in his West Village home with a needle sticking out of his arm, Aaron was taken into custody after police found nearly 300 bags of heroin.

Aaron said that the majority were for personal use and explained why he continues to call himself a drug addict.

'A lot of times you have a deadline and you have to work for 24 hours. This lets you do it with no pain, no tiredness…,' said Aaron.

'If I have to write a book, get me high — I’ll have the book written in two weeks. You’re lucid. And emotions don’t affect you as much — your anger — it bottles up your feelings.

'It makes you more rational, or you think you are, anyway. You sleep wonderfully. I’m a lifelong insomniac.'

Aaron denies he sold the drug as a dealer to Hoffman - although he admits he would occasionally sell drugs to his friends.

'I was my own best customer. I always say, a monkey can’t sell bananas.' said Aaron.

His friends told The New York Times he was a consummate professional, and someone whose habit has never affected his work.

In discussing Hoffman, who Aaron claims to have known for a little over a year before the actor's death, he says that the two would speak about their drug use.

'People make choices in life, and they should be allowed to do whatever they want. And if that’s his choice, I’m really sad but I respect his choice,' said Aaron.

'He was an adult. He’d been doing it a while, he knew what he was up against. Nobody killed him.

'If you’re looking for the person who killed him, you know who it was. Him. Nobody else. It’s really sad, though. And more horrible is the way he’s portrayed in death. Who needs that?'

Indeed, while the NYPD told the press that they were acting on a tip that Aaron supplied drugs to Hoffman - that actor has not featured in his indictment.

And last month, a judge denied Aaron's request that he undergo treatment instead of serving jail time.
