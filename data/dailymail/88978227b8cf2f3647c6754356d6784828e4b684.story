Jordan Begley, 23, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000-volt charge from a stun gun when police were called to his home last year 

Five police officers want their identities kept secret at an inquest into the death of an innocent man who was shot with a Taser.

Police were called to Jordan Begley’s terraced home by his mother during a row with a neighbour last year.

But the ice cream factory worker, 23, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000-volt charge from the stun gun.

Now a group of officers involved in the tragedy in Gorton, Manchester, have sparked outrage by asking for anonymity when they give evidence at the inquest, which is expected to take place early next year.

Critics have warned the case risks damaging public confidence in the police if officers accused of potential wrong-doing are allowed to hide behind a shroud of secrecy.

Lawyers representing the five Greater Manchester Police officers have refused to say why they believe their identities should be protected. No information was given during a hearing last month.

Firearms officers are usually granted anonymity during court cases and inquests because of the extreme sensitivity of their jobs and fear of reprisals – or in cases involving terrorism or national security.

But it would be highly unusual to mask the identities of ordinary officers trained to use Tasers, which are supposed to be non-lethal weapons but have been linked to at least ten deaths since 2004.

Coroner Nigel Meadows acknowledged a ‘significant issue regarding the ordinary principles of open justice’ but has granted an interim anonymity order.

However, the order is set to be challenged by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, lawyers acting for Mr Begley’s mother Dorothy and news organisations at a pre-inquest hearing taking place as early as this month.

James Dipple-Johnstone, the IPCC Commissioner for Greater Manchester, said withholding the names of the GMP officers ‘will not help foster public confidence’.

He added: ‘At the end of the independent IPCC investigation, when our work is complete, we hope to publish a report in a transparent way.’

The Begley family are also understood to be pressing for full details of the incident to be made public.

Police – some of whom were armed – were called to deal with a disturbance at Mr Begley’s home on the evening of July 10 last year and were initially told he had a knife.

He collapsed after being shot with the Taser and was pronounced dead in hospital less than two hours later. Six weeks before the incident, he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests.

Police have also vehemently denied claims that Mr Begley was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name.

The case has already been referred by GMP to the IPCC, but its findings will not be published until after the inquest.

Greater Manchester Police and legal firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing the five officers, declined to comment yesterday.

It comes after a former Metropolitan Police marksman charged with murdering a robbery suspect in 2005 was last week named as Anthony Long. Reporting restrictions were lifted because Long has been charged with a crime.
