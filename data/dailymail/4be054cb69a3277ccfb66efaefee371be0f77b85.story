CCTV cameras have caught footage of what could be Britain's most desperate robber.

The ham-fisted thief was filmed trying to smash his way through a Post Office's toughened glass screen and two reinforced doors before clambering through a ceiling to snatch just a few pounds from the counter.

Moments earlier he was seen pacing up and down the street in Failsworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he was overheard muttering, 'I have no money - may as well do the Post Office'.

It begins: This is the moment the thief entered the Watchcote Post Office in Failsworth, near Oldham

Gotta get that cash: As customers are still being served, the robber tries to pull open the locked door to the back

Just ask... Foiled by the lock on the door, the hapless robber tries demanding money from the cashiers

Next: Staff aren't having it, so the thief misguidedly tries to use a plastic lottery ticked stand to smash through

He then burst into the Watchcote Post 
Office so determined to rob it that, after staff refused his demands to 
hand over the cash, he tried four different ways to get behind the 
counter.

First he tried to 
pull open the door to the back. Finding it unsurprisingly locked, he 
turned to the cashiers and demanded they hand over the cash, vainly 
punching the reinforced glass screen.

Next
 he picked up a plastic National Lottery ticket stand and tried to use 
it as a battering ram to shatter the toughened glass screen.

When
 that failed, he vainly tried again to open the secure doors to the back,
 trying to kick his way through one of them.Â  And finally he climbed 
onto a shelf and started pulling polystyrene tiles from the false 
ceiling.

Despite almost 
getting stuck when his legs fell through the ceiling frame, the 
determined robber was able to clamber through the roof void as staff 
cowered in a back room after activating a panic alarm.

He
 eventually grabbed an undisclosed quantity of cash which had been left 
on the counter, understood to be a small amount, before making good his 
escape - leaving a trail of debris in his wake.

Greater Manchester Police today issued
 CCTV of the raid at 11am on Christmas Eve, calling the two minute 
hold-up 'hamfisted' and an 'act of desperation.'

Officers
 believe the man was seen before the robbery outside the Post Office, 
where he made several comments about his financial position, including 
comments about not being able to buy Christmas presents for children.

Police described balaclava-clad bandit as white, of a pale complexion, about six foot tall, and in his 20s.

He was also said to have wide, pale blue eyes and was wearing a black woollen balaclava, blue tracksuit and thick black gloves.

A cunning plan: The thief realises that he might be able to gain access to the back via the roof

A breakthrough: After removing several tiles he makes his way into the ceiling void

Not quite plain sailing: Before he can get in, the robbers legs fall through the fragile polystyrene tiles

A not so clean getaway: After snatching some money, he makes his escape - leaving a trail of debris behind

Detective Constable Tony Anwas said: 'This CCTV paints perfectly the picture of just how desperate this man was to get his hands on some cash.

'I believe he has made a spur of the moment decision to rob the Post Office, and has executed his plan in a rushed and ham-fisted manner.

'We believe he was pacing about beforehand and making several comments about his dire financial position and inability to afford Christmas gifts.

'If you were outside and saw or spoke to this person we really need to hear from you.

'We also need to hear from anyone who knows who the person responsible is or who, having viewed the CCTV, recognises someone from the build of the man, the way he has walked or the clothing worn.'
