Dick Advocaat has confirmed that Adam Johnson is available for selection ahead of his first game in charge at West Ham.

The Sunderland winger returned to training on Wednesday after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.

The Black Cats took the decision to allow Johnson to return after his bail was extended to April 23.

The veteran Dutch manager admitted it was a big challenge taking over at the Stadium of Light

Advocaat has worked with the 27-year-old at the Academy of Light this week and he took part in a full-scale practice match on Thursday.

And, when asked during his unveiling press conference if Johnson would play at West Ham, Advocaat said: ‘Everyone who is training is available for selection.

‘I name the squad after the final training session.’

Advocaat has inherited a side one point and one place above the drop zone. The Dutchman, however, had no reservations about taking on the task at the Stadium of Light.

‘It’s a big challenge to take over in this position,’ said the 67-year-old, who revealed this week that he has known for a few weeks he was in line to replace Gus Poyet. 

‘I was a free man after what happened in Serbia (sacked in November).‘The opportunity came and I thought, in my opinion, it was a good side and a great club – so why not?

‘In Holland we can see all of the games on TV. I know the players. We have a great stadium and great fans – with their support we should be able to stay up.

Johnson rejoined his team-mates on Wednesday, followed by a full training match on Thursday

‘I have a good feeling about the squad from the last three days.’

Advocaat has signed a nine-game deal on Wearside and is almost certain to return to Holland at the end of the season.

He explained: ‘We did not discuss that (staying on). For me it’s important to do this job. What happens after is not so important.’
