Islamic State fighters have released new photos of a man having his hand chopped off for theft and another man being whipped for watching porn.

The graphic images, which were posted online, give the first indication of how the shocking amputation punishment is being carried out as ISIS delivers its own twisted form of justice.

The horrific sentence was carried out in the Iraqi border town of Qa'im, in Euphrates province. 

Severed: This is the moment Islamic State fighters administered their own brutal brand of justice by cutting off the hand of a man who was allegedly caught stealing

Justice: ISIS law demands that, after a trial, a list of the criminals' crimes be read out in front of a crowd of men who have been invited to watch, before the punishment is carried out

In front of a large crowd of men, the victim was blindfolded with a large patterned scarf and forced to place his arm on a table.

One masked Islamic State fighter, wearing surgical gloves and a grey and pink striped jumper underneath his camouflage military vest, is shown trying to keep the victim's arm steady.

On the table, the victim's arm has been stretched out on top of a wooden plank, covered with a white cloth. A large bottle of antiseptic is also positioned on the edge of the table.

A rope is tied around the victim's wrist, allowing another Islamic State fighter to yank the severed hand away from the arm after it has been hacked off with a cleaver. 

One especially grisly image shows the detached hand in mid air, still tied to the rope.

ISIS fighters also posted a high definition photo of the man's severed hand showing that the amputation was not a clean cut, leaving  bone and tissue hanging from the hand.

A final photo of the victim's stump being covered in a gauze bandage is also shown. 

Typically ISIS would also release an image of the victim hugging the fighter who has punished him, but this was not done in this case.

Punished: For the first time these images reveal how amputations are carried out. The victim is sat in a chair with a noose tied to his wrist (centre) which is used to pull the hand away after it is severed

Public: ISIS law demands that all punishments be carried out in public, and a large crowd of men are usually invited to watch each sentence

The vile punishment comes days after Islamic State posted photos of a man being flogged for watching pornography in Syria.

According to captions on the photographs, the man was found guilty of 'watching pornographic videos' and was publicly whipped in front of a large crowd in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor.

The victim appears to be in his early 20s and is smartly dressed in a red jumper. In front of a large crowd, the man is shown being whipped by an Islamic State fighter.

As is customary in Islamic State punishment propaganda, the final photograph appears to be a staged scene, where the victim is shown hugging the IS fighter who has just punished him as an act of forgiveness.

Last month, Islamic State released a document on social media, explaining the rules of Islamic State penal code, which is being brutally enforced across IS-held territory in Syria and Iraq.

Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law.

All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court. After the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. 

Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments.

Twisted: A medical team wait nearby with bottles of antiseptic and bandages to help patch the victim up after the punishment is finished

An Islamic State fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public.

All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death.

Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion.

According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed.

Islamic State's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated. This terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim's past crime.

Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. 

According to the document, 80 lashes of the whip is given to anyone who drinks alcohol or is found guilty of committing slander. Normally the whipping is not carried out on bare skin.

The punishment of stoning, where heavy rocks are thrown or piled on top of the victim, is ordered for any married man or woman who has committed adultery.

A hundreds lashes and immediate exile is given to any man or woman who has sex outside of marriage.
