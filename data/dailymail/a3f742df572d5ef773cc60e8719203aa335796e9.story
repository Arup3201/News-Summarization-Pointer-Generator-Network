Jailed: Christopher Halliwell killed Sian O'Callaghan after picking her up in his cab in 2011

Police fear they have discovered the secret lair of a suspected serial killer who may have murdered up to six women. 

Forensic officers have been scouring a remote pond following the discovery of boots belonging to murdered Sian O'Callaghan, 22.

Jailed taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, 55, killed the clubber after picking her up in his cab outside a Swindon nightclub in 2011. 

Last month police found Miss O'Callaghan's brown boots, a shotgun, and a huge hoard of women's clothing in and around an 8ft deep pond in woodland in Ramsbury, Wiltshire.

Halliwell admitted picking her up and murdering her and is now serving 25 years.

The killer also led police to the grave of a second woman, Becky Godden-Edwards, who disappeared around 2007 when she was 25.

However, he was formally cleared of murdering her when a judge ruled a senior detective had broken the rules surrounding arrests.

A CID source said the recent finds have prompted fears there are more victims.

An anonymous CID source told the Sunday Express: 'We are being methodical and careful. 

'We don't want to make any mistakes and the major thrust is to find some link to Becky so we can re-interview Halliwell under caution.

'The nightmare scenario is that this lonely place might be linked to the murder of five innocent women or more. A buried cache of clothing is unlikely to be fly-tipping.

'There may be an innocent explanation, but everything hinges on the work of the forensic scientists.

'The discovery of Sian's boots, together with a shotgun barrel, in the pond nearby is undeniably sinister.'

Police have continued to investigate the murder of Miss Godden, who had drifted into drugs and prostitution before her death.

Officers found her remains in a field in Eastleach, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire in March 2011 having been led there by Halliwell.

Last month they revealed they had found a bone at the Cotswold beauty spot, which belonged to Miss Godden.

Detectives are believed to have the DNA of four other women, or close family matches to them, ready to compare with any samples found, the Sunday Express claimed.

Four young women remain missing from nearby Swindon where Halliwell snatched Sian off the street before her near-naked body was found five days later in a shallow grave.

Sandra Brewin, of Peatmoor, disappeared from her parents' home in 1994 aged 21 just months after she became penfriends with a man who was in prison in Oxfordshire.

Other unsolved missing person cases in the area include college worker mum-of-four Linda Razzell, 41, who disappeared from Swindon in 2002.

Her husband, Glyn, was convicted of her killing but continues to protest his innocence.

Police search an area of woodland and a pond near the village Ramsbury in Wiltshire as new evidence is found into the murder of Sian O'Callaghan

The whereabouts of the young Vietnamese immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, 20, have been unknown since she went missing from her temporary home in Swindon in June 2005.

The CID source added: 'There is the chilling thought that Sian was not the first and Halliwell may have been roughly working to some dreadful blueprint from previous incidents.

'If it turns out the items of clothing found at Hilldrop belong to more than one missing woman it would go towards confirming the rather chilling theory that he may have had a routine.'

A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police yesterday (Sunday) did not deny officers were exploring the possibility Halliwell had more victims - but said the CID source's comments were 'highly speculative'.

She said: 'The searches in the Ramsbury area have been completed as of 4.30pm on 31 May and the items found are now subject to review and testing. 

'Wiltshire police have made no links to the missing women mentioned or any other cases at this stage.

'Although a 'CID' source has been quoted, the comments made by this individual are highly speculative and unhelpful to our investigations.

'Detectives are in the early stages of the review and any forensic testing.

'Speculation such as this is unhelpful and can be potentially distressing for families who may have lost their loved ones.

'Wiltshire Police are committed to ensuring a thorough investigation and will maximise any evidential opportunities that are found. 

'However, at this stage it is too early to make links to missing women or to speculate on why the items were found there.'
