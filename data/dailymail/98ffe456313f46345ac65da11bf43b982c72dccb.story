Sean Clode, 21, from Hartlepool, outside Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough where he has been convicted of sexual grooming and child abduction

A paedophile who had sex with a 14-year-old after grooming her while she played computer games has been found guilty of sexual grooming and child abduction.

Sean Clode, 21, started speaking to the teenager after befriending her while the pair played computer games.

Clode, from Hartlepool, County Durham spend the night with the child in a tent on the beach after she travelled hundreds of miles from her home in Scotland to meet him.

Teesside Crown Court heard that her frantic father drove through the night to try and find his teenage daughter.

In a statement, he said: ‘As I got to Hartlepool, it was first light and I spent an hour walking around the docks.

'Then, beside myself with worry, I attended Hartlepool police station.’

‘During my frantic attempts to locate my daughter, I walked along the coastline, knocked on doors and spoke to postmen.’

He was informed that a police helicopter found her at around 2pm.

He said: ‘I was becoming increasingly concerned I wouldn’t see (her) alive again.

'No words can explain how traumatic and upsetting this whole experience has been for me and my family.’

Footage from a police helicopter showed Clode, 21, leaving the tent while the girl pulled her dress down.

The next day she told police they had sex several times, but retracted the claim the following month. 

The prosecution claimed she altered her account out of ‘misplaced loyalty’ or embarrassment.

Clode denied all offences and said the girl arrived in Hartlepool without his knowledge. He claimed he decided to take her to the beach as 'it would look bad' for him to take her home.

The 21-year-old told the jury the pair were fully clothed at all times and insisted they did not have sex.

‘I never groomed that lass, I was just helping her,' he said.

The jury deliberated for just over an hour before convicting him of sexual grooming, child abduction and two counts of sexual activity with a child.

The abduction charge relates to his removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents.

Clode was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in two weeks’ time, but was warned by Judge Howard Crownson that jail was inevitable.
