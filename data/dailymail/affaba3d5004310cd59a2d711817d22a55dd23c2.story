'Qualification inflation': Vince Cable said professions should relax the demand for qualifications from workers

Vince Cable yesterday attacked the demand for ‘superfluous’ degrees in a range of careers that act as a barrier to applicants.

The Business Secretary said ‘qualification inflation’ was holding back people who wanted to become police officers, nurses or accountants.

He argued it should be easier to be accepted into professions with lower qualifications such as A-levels and apprenticeships.

Talks were being held with professional associations to relax minimum requirements, he added, but it was becoming difficult to ‘de-graduate’ some jobs.

The comments come at a time when the number of young people entering higher education has soared to almost 50 per cent.

Dr Cable, whose department is responsible for higher education, told a conference in London on improving social mobility through education that the issue was a ‘major problem’.

He said: ‘The idea that in order to be a police officer or a nurse you have to have a degree - that’s just qualification inflation.

‘There may be some qualitative improvement associated with it but arguably not. I think we have passed that barrier. It’s very difficult to de-graduate a lot of the big professions of that kind.’

He added: ‘For a whole lot of fairly standard professions - not elite professions - a degree is like a basic qualification.

‘We are conscious of some areas like accountancy and elsewhere where degree qualifications appear to be superfluous.

‘We are trying to persuade professionals associations to relax their qualifications.’

Officially, there are no formal qualifications needed to join the police, although entry requirements differ between forces.

But the explosion in the number of graduates means talented applicants who have not gone to university may be overlooked.

University-leavers are also able to take advantage of fast-track schemes that allow promotion through the ranks much quicker than usual and in some cases by-passing lower ranks altogether.

'Superfluous: The Business Secretary pointed out professions where degrees do not seem to be of use

Nurses’ training moved into higher education from the 1990s. Most applicants have to complete a three-year course, with around half their time studying at a university and the rest gaining experience on a ward.

The surge in university applications began under the last Labour government, which set a target of half of young people studying for degrees.

It has been continued by the Coalition, although critics warn many end up taking worthless degrees or are unable to find suitable work at the end of their course because so many graduates are chasing jobs.

The government is trying to promote apprenticeships and other schemes as an alternative to the traditional university route into many careers.

Steve White, the vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said large numbers of officers now were graduates.

‘There’s a feeling that you have to get a degree in order to do anything,’ he added.

He also warned fast-track schemes could rob senior officers of vital experience, saying: ‘You’ve got to understand the grass roots in order to get the necessary grounding to go through the ranks.’

But Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said the job had ‘traditionally created social mobility and this has continued with the introduction of an all-graduate work force’.

He added: ‘Last year the Willis Commission into nursing education found that the increasingly technical nature of nursing and added responsibilities such as prescribing meant the move to an all-graduate profession was essential.

‘A degree has been a requirement for other professions such as midwifery and physiotherapy for many years with very few claims that it is unnecessary or undesirable.’
