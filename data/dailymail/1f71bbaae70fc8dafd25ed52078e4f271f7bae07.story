Author Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during the 2013-14 season, Pep Guardiola's first in charge of the Bundesliga giants.

In his new book Pep Confidential, Perarnau uses his behind-the-scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into Guardiola's debut campaign in Germany.

In this extract he covers Guardiola's decision to snub Chelsea, Manchester City and AC Milan in order to take over from Jupp Heynckes at the Allianz Arena.

Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid was the 'biggest f***-up' of his life as a coach

'PREPARE YOURSELF, MANEL. I've chosen Bayern!'

In Pescara, in the north-east of Italy, Manel Estiarte smiles. Hard though it had been for his old friend to close one chapter of his life, the decision about his next step had obviously been an easy one. Their destination would not after all be England, but Germany.

The exchange is taking place five months after Pep's departure from Barca. In this time, he has been flooded with offers: Chelsea, Manchester City, Milan and, of course, Bayern. In reality, they are not job offers, but love letters, project proposals for this most illustrious of coaches.

During his sabbatical year the job offers poured in. His ex-colleague Txiki Begiristain, the director of football at Manchester City, was very insistent. He also met up in Paris with Roman Abramovich, who was prepared to do anything to lure Pep to Chelsea.

Bayern, too, were anxious to register an early interest and a delegation from Munich attended Pep's last game with Barca, the final of the Copa del Rey against Athletic in Madrid on May 25, 2012. The Catalan club won 3-0 that day. 

In the event the Bayern delegation did not get a chance speak to Guardiola, but they made their interest clear during a meeting with his agent. It was just six days since the Munich team had suffered a painful defeat by Chelsea in the Champions League final,  on penalties at their own stadium.

It was another heavy blow for the Bavarian club at the end of a bitterly disappointing period. One week earlier, they had lost 5-2 to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal [German cup] final in Berlin. Their opponents had just won their second consecutive league title after a brilliant campaign, beating Bayern by eight points.

In the space of a few weeks Bayern had lost three titles: the Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal and the Champions League. After enduring the agonising Champions League defeat, Heynckes promised his wife that he would only go on for one more year. The directors of Bayern felt the same way. A substitute had to be found.

From the start Pep was well disposed to the overtures from the Bavarian club. A year before, in late July 2011, not long after a resounding 3-1 victory in the Champions League final against Manchester United at Wembley, Barcelona competed in the Audi Cup in Munich. Pep liked the set-up at Sabener Strasse, despite the fact that it was smaller than Barca's training ground and had fewer technical facilities. The Catalan was impressed and told Manel Estiarte privately: 'I like this place. I could see myself coaching here one day.'

Nationality: Spanish  Age: 43

Clubs played for: Barcelona (1990-2001), Brescia (2001-2002), Roma (2002-2003), Brescia (2003), Al-Ahli (2003-2005), Dorados (2005-06) 

Major honours: 6 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 1 European Cup, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, 2 UEFA Super Cups, 1 Olympic Gold medal 

Teams managed: Barcelona B (2007-2008), Barcelona (2008-2012), Bayern Munich (2013-present) 

Major honours: 3 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 2 Champions Leagues, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 3 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Bundesliga title, 1 German Cup

Estiarte was not too surprised by the comment. Pep had said something very similar a few months before, at Manchester United. The day after beating Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, Guardiola and Estiarte travelled to Manchester to watch their next opponent in action. It was May 4, 2011, and the pair sat together in the stands of Old Trafford watching Sir Alex Ferguson's team beat Schalke 4-1. Once again Pep had turned to his friend and said: 'I like this atmosphere. I could see myself coaching here one day.'

Guardiola has always felt a deep admiration, almost veneration, for the legendary teams and players of Europe. Estiarte knows this and was therefore not surprised by Pep's eagerness to meet up for a chat with Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in June 2011. The four had a quick coffee together and it soon became clear that his feelings of admiration for the two Germans were reciprocated in equal measure.

Bayern had just appointed Jupp Heynckes to manage the second phase of their project, the initial stage having been overseen by Louis van Gaal. Guardiola, fresh from winning another Champions League title with Barca, was still totally committed to the Catalan club. At that moment none of them could have imagined how closely linked their destinies would become.

Guardiola recalls: 'We were there for a friendly against Bayern and we met Kalle [Rummenigge] and Uli [Hoeness] for a chat. I told them how much I admired both their current team and Bayern Munich as a club. It has always been one of the great clubs of European football. But I had never given a thought to coaching there. Nor was I thinking about it then. I was certainly not offering them my services. The fact that I ended up signing for the club a few years later was just a twist of fate.'

It is October 2012 and in New York, Maria, Marius and Valentina, Pep's three children, are still struggling to learn English and adjust to life at their new school. The Catalan coach's phone is ringing off the hook with job offers.

Begiristain's Manchester City are still keen, and very insistent. Abramovich is deploying all his charm. He wants Pep and is prepared to mould the team to his specifications. The Germans, too, are determined, although their pitch is slightly lower key and to the point.

It is now that, in one of their FaceTime chats, Guardiola tells his friend and colleague: 'Prepare yourself Manel. I've chosen Bayern'

Choosing Bayern does not mean signing the contract immediately, however. It is just the first stage in the negotiations about financial terms and footballing philosophy.

Hoeness promises Pep from the start: 'Don't worry, we'll find the money.'

Bayern prefer to avoid debt and their policy is to ask their club members and sponsors to foot the bill for any new investment. In this case everyone is happy to invest in Pep.

They discuss their preferred playing styles and the kind of players the club will need. Not a lot more needs to be said. Pep, Uli and Kalle are on the same wavelength. The conversation goes so well it's almost as if the three of them have a ball at their feet. They discuss Mario Gomez, Luiz Gustavo and Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, and Pep insists that he wants to hold on to Toni Kroos.

By December they are ready to sign the contracts, and president Hoeness meets Guardiola at his home in New York. Guardiola then informs Manchester City, Chelsea and AC Milan that he is going elsewhere and before long Sky Italia breaks the news.

Bayern's hand has been forced and on January 16 the club hastily issues a statement.

Unfortunately they also, rather insensitively, fail to inform Heynckes first. The incumbent coach feels badly let down. His friends Hoeness and Rummenigge had told him they were looking for a replacement, but not who it was going to be.

Over in Barcelona tongues are wagging and Pep's critics accuse him of taking the soft option. Little do they know that back in Munich  Heynckes' metamorphosis from coach to living legend has just begun and that he is about to lead his team through a jaw-droppingly successful treble, setting the bar tremendously high for his successor.
