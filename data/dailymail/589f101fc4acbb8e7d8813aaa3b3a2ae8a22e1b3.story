Warning: Home Secretary Theresa May said an independent Scotland would struggle to replicate the UK's intelligence network

An independent Scotland would face greater threats from criminal masterminds, international terrorists and online hackers, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned.

A hard-hitting new report from the UK Government has raised the risk of ‘diminished security’ if Scots vote for separation in next year’s referendum.

Mrs May said the network of agencies that protect British citizens – including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and the National Crime Agency – would remain with the rest of the UK, and Scotland would be frozen out.

That would force Scottish ministers to start from scratch, but the SNP’s top-end projection of a £2.5billion budget for defence and security is less than the sum spent by Denmark and Norway on defence alone – and compares to £35billion spent every year across the UK.

The Westminster report, the seventh in a series of 13 documents on the impact of a Yes vote, also warns that a separate Scotland would have no ‘automatic right to entry’ to key bodies such as the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing partnership between the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

The paper warns that organised crime groups do not recognise borders, and law enforcement bodies currently work across the UK to tackle drug peddling and other illegal activities.

Areas of expertise, such as the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, would not be available to an independent Scotland and a separate air passenger security regime would have to be set up.

Scotland would also be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks unless it invests significant resources, which poses a huge risk for businesses.

The report states: ‘The creation of an independent Scottish state will, without proper planning and investment, lead to a reduction in the capability of its government to protect Scottish interests, infrastructure and people from these threats.

‘A reduced capability to tackle a persistent threat would result in an increased risk to the Scottish people.’

The findings were backed by 
former Labour Home Secretary Lord John Reid, but SNP MSP Christine 
Grahame said the UK Government’s decision to ‘politicise issues of 
security and anti-terrorism’ was ‘the height of irresponsibility’.

Blair Jenkins, leader of the Yes Scotland campaign, complained that Mrs May was ‘talking Scotland down’.

Threat: The Home Office report also warned cross-border policing would be mired in red tape and the fight against serious crime would be ¿undermined

A
separate Scotland would be forced to establish a network of specialist 
bodies that are currently part of the UK’s new National Crime Agency.

The Westminster government has 
produced a list of 15 ‘capabilities’ that an independent Scottish 
Government would ‘have to consider whether to invest or retain or 
replicate’.

The list includes the Missing 
Persons Bureau, which is the UK’s national point of contact for all 
missing people and unidentified body cases.

An independent Scotland would also 
lose access to the Financial Intelligence Unit that identifies 
suspicious activity related to money laundering and terrorist financing.

The Child Exploitation and Online 
Protection Command organisation is another example, with the body 
sharing 157 intelligence records with Scottish police chiefs in 2012.

Other bodies on the list are the UK
National Central Office for Counterfeit Currency, the Human Trafficking
Centre, the Anti-Kidnap and Extortion Centre and the Illicit Laboratory
Team.

But the Home Secretary said: ‘The national security risks the UK faces are complex and changing. Terrorists and organised criminals will seek new ways to exploit any weakness in our justice and policing capabilities, and the scale of emerging threats, such as cyber crime, demands a comprehensively resourced response.’

Mrs May rejected nationalist arguments that Scotland may face a diminished threat from terrorism by rejecting nuclear weapons and shunning ‘illegal wars’ such as the Iraq conflict.

‘There are those for whom it is not just country-specific because of foreign policy, or actions that have taken place, but there is an issue about the West and the way of life in the West,’ she said.

‘But what would change would be the scale of capability that Scotland would have access to.’

The UK's current intelligence and security network could not be easily divided and resources such as the £860million UK cyber security programme ‘would not be available to Scotland’, she said.

Mrs May added: ‘Separate bits could not be hived off. This is one of the challenges, one of the hard issues that the SNP need to address.’

Former Home secretary Lord Reid said: ‘A separate Scotland would need to massively reduce security spending and operations from that of the UK, but the threat would not be commensurately reduced.

‘We would therefore be left with the same level of threat but with a much-reduced capacity to respond.’

But Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: ‘These claims are wrong - not least because Scotland is already an independent jurisdiction when it comes to policing and justice issues, and current cross-border cooperation shows how well that can work to combat terrorism and other threats.

‘An independent Scotland will have first rate security arrangements to counter any threats we may face. And we will continue to work in very close collaboration with the rest of the UK and international partners on security and intelligence matters, which is in everyone's interests.’

Nationalist MSP Christine Grahame, who chairs Holyrood's justice committee, said: ‘The SNP has a record of delivering when it comes to policing and security and we will take no lessons from someone who has done so much to undermine this vital area south of the border.’

Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, added: ‘As our nearest neighbours, we can expect a particularly close working relationship with the security services of the UK, to our mutual best interests.’
