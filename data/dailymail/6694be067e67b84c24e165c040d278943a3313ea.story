Sportsmail reviews the action from the third day of the 2014 French Open at Roland Garros.

French teenager Laurent Lokoli left the 
court in tears after going down to American Steve Johnson.

After making 
such a splash in the pre-event charity day with his exhuberant dancing 
on court with Gael Monfils he had been poised for an unlikely victory 
when leading by two sets and 4-2 – but he was to lose in five.

Crying game: Laurent Lokoli was reduced to tears after losing to Steve Johnson in Paris

Remember
 the name of 18 year-old American Taylor Townsend. Cut from US Tennis 
Association support over concerns about her weight she is nonetheless as
 clean a ballstriker as has emerged for a long time.

She played 
wonderful match to beat 20th seed Alize Cornet 6-4 4-6 6-4.

Not
 much has gone right for Germany’s Sabine Lisicki since her surprise run
 to the Wimbledon final last summer.

On Wednesday she slipped and hurt her 
wrist while playing compatriot Mona Barthel and had to retire in the 
second set. It does not augur well for her return to SW19.

By
 making the second round (in which he lost to Milos Raonic) 20 year-old 
Czech Jiri Vesely should enter the world’s top 80.

Meanwhile the Brit 
who beat him in the 2011 U.S Open final, Oliver Golding, has left the 
LTA set-up to branch out on his own to try and break through from his 
contrasting ranking of 333.

Bookmakers
 frantically have had to frantically reset their odds on the women’s 
singles after the upsets of top seeds Serena Williams and Li Na.

Maria 
Sharapova becomes clear favourite at 7-4, with Simona Halep at 5-1 and 
the resurgent Ana Ivanovic, the 2008 champion, at 9-1.

Front runner: Maria Sharapova is the women's favourite after a series of shock upsets
