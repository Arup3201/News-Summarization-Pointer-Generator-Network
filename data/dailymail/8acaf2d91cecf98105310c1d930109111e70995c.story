New York Giants star David Diehl has been charged with drink driving after witnesses said that he was so drunk behind the wheel of his BMW on Sunday night that he could barely stand.

The offensive linesman had been in a bar prior to the crash, watching the Croatian soccer team beat the
Republic of Ireland 3-1 in the European Championship.

The 6'5, 304lb player used his Twitter account to apologize for crashing into three parked cars in Queens, New York after he 
was found to have a blood alcohol level of .182 percent - more than 
twice the legal limit.

One bystander, Al, 48, told the New York Daily News: 'He was totally obliterated. He couldn’t even function.'

Diehl entered no plea at court today 
after spending the night in a cell wearing his Croatian soccer top. His 
case was adjourned until July 26.

The judge also barred the player from driving until his next court date. He could spend up to a year in jail over the charge.

Diehl wrote on Twitter: 'I’ve worked 
hard during my career to set a positive example, and yesterday I fell 
far short of this standard. I apologize to my family, my fans, my 
teammates, the New York Giants, and the NFL.

'I made a poor decision that I sincerely regret, and, as always, take full responsibility for my actions.'

Jubilant: Diehl, whose relatives hail from Croatia, tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' twice as the team scored and later wrote '3-1' when the win was confirmed

Diehl, 31, whose relatives hail from 
Croatia, twice tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' in celebration as the 
team scored.

A photograph of him wearing a red and white chequered 
Croatia replica shirt was also posted on Twitter, but it was removed 
following his arrest.

Diehl, who has twice won the Super 
Bowl with the Giants, wrecked his black BMW at about 8.20pm on Sunday 
night in the Astoria area of the city. No one was injured. He had been driving alone and was arrested at the scene.

Diehl was taken to a police station and he failed a breath test.

The Twitter user who posted the 
picture of Diehl said the star was celebrating at Scorpio Cafe & Bar
in Astoria, which is five blocks from the crash site at Broadway and 
31st Street.

Police confirmed the player had been to a local bar.

Diehl had been watching the Croatia team move to the top of Group C at the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine.

He tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' twice and later wrote '3-1' when the team's win was confirmed.

The final tweet carried the hashtag '#hrvatska', which means Croatia in its native language.

The Giants, who are the reigning Super Bowl champions, made no immediate comment.

The player’s agent, Peter Schaffer, declined to comment, but called Diehl 'one of, if not the classiest, most humble ... New York Giants ever'.
