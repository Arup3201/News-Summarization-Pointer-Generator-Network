Fox News prime time king Sean Hannity could be about to be ousted from his coveted 9 p.m. slot by daytime beauty Megyn Kelly in a dramatic network shake up, according to reports.

Hannity launched his current show 'Hannity' in 2009 after years as the conservative co-host of 'point-counterpoint' program 'Hannity & Colmes.'

But it appears the 51-year-old is about to be bumped for Kelly, or possibly joined by the 42-year-old former 'America Live' host, according to The Drudge Report.

The website cites a top source with the news that the coveted 9 p.m. slot will soon belong to Kelly, and it says an official announcement will be made later this month.

'It's all about Megyn,' an insider told Drudge. 'She is the new face of cable news. She has it all!' 

In a statement to MailOnline, a Fox News spokesperson said: 'We will neither confirm nor deny any programming schedule changes. As previously stated, the network has signed long-term deals with Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, Shepard Smith, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren.'

Fox News revealed last month that Kelly would be moving to a prime time job but didn't reveal what hour she would be assuming.

Speculation was rife about who would get the boot, but confusion reigned as the station had just signed a number of long-time contracts with current prime time hosts, including with Hannity.

Hannity is reportedly signed to the network through the 2016 election.

His other prime time colleagues, Bill O'Reilly and Greta Van Susteren are also signed up for years, and Van Susteren recently responded to speculation saying her contract stipulates that her show would be prime time. 

Hannity and Van Susteren's shows hit new rating lows earlier this year in their demographic but they remain far and away the top programs in their time slots.

Others speculated that she may join one of the current presenters as a co-host or be given a not-strictly-prime time slot of 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.

After numerous contributing roles for the network, Kelly began hosting her own two hour show, America Live, in February 2010, replacing Fox News' previous show The Live Desk co-hosted by Martha MacCallum and Trace Gallagher.

Kelly left that role last month for maternity leave and assume the new slot when she returns in the fall.
