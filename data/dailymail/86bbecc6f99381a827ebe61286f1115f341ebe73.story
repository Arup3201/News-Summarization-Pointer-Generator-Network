Diego Poyet is officially a happy hammer after West Ham's new signing patched up his relationship with Andy Carroll after posting tweets three years ago criticising the striker.

Poyet tweeted a picture of him in a jovial headlock with Carroll on Wednesday along with the caption: 'Feel stupid for the tweets I made when I was 16, the big mans going to kill me!! Sorry @AndyTCarroll'

Even though the pair have patched things up it appears that Poyet still has some grovelling to do to Carroll after he responded to his team-mate's tweet: 'A big thanks to @diegopoyet7 for agreeing to make my morning cuppa every morning for next month!!'

Tweet and sour: West Ham defender Aaron Cresswell also tweeted an apology to help his friend out

Sorry! Aaron Cresswell used comedy foursome The Inbetweeners to get the apology across to Andy Carroll

West Ham defender Aaron Cresswell also got involved by posting an infamous 'Sorry' video from hit comedy 'The Inbetweeners' to his Twitter account in reference to the tweets.

Poyet and Carroll hadn't seen eye-to-eye since December 2011 when Poyet initially tweeted despairingly about the England international performances.

'I went to subway and asked for the greasiest, biggest and most expensive sub they had. They gave me Andy Carrol' he tweeted.

The barrage of abuse continued during Euro 2012 as Carroll spearheaded England's attack in Poland and Ukraine.

Ouch: Poyet's feud with Carroll began in December 2011 when he compared him to a Subway sandwich

Poor: Poyet has also tweeted that he felt Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse were better than Carroll in the past

Faint praise: Poyet even had a dig at Carroll despite scoring for England in Euro 2012

Relative? Poyet mocked Carroll's transfer fee to Liverpool in comparison to the Olympic opening ceremony

'Don't see why Newcastle want Andy Carroll when both Demba Ba and Cisse are better than him #Fact

'£27m got Danny Boyle the queen, James Bond, Mohammad Ali, Beckham, Wiggins, Redgrave & a cast of 1000s. Liverpool got Andy Carroll for £35m.'

Even when the 25-year-old gave England the lead in their 3-2 win over Sweden, the midfielder was damning in his praise with: 'Carroll your a donkey, but I love you right now.'

Shocking: Poyet called West Ham winger Stewart Downing one of Liverpool's worst players in 2012

Despite changing his tune with Carroll it is unclear whether or not the former Charlton man has made amends with West Ham winger Stewart Downing yet.

'Stewart Downing is one of the worst players I've ever seen in a Liverpool shirt, any chance of him keeping the ball just once?'

Poyet, who penned a four-year deal from Charlton in July, will be hoping to make his competitive debut for his new side in their Premier League opener at home to London rivals Tottenham on Saturday.
