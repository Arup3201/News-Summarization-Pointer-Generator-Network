As the cricket world held its breath for Phillip Hughes, one of the few people who can fully understand what he is going through recalled how he defied the most unlikely odds.

The life of West Indies batsman Phil Simmons was in danger when he, like the stricken Australian, was struck on the head by a cricket ball — in his case, one propelled by the fast and fiery David Lawrence 26 years ago during a tour match at Bristol.

Simmons had emergency brain surgery amid a gloomy prognosis about his future but, remarkably, he was up and out of hospital within eight days.

Even more remarkably, the Trinidadian, who had made his Test debut earlier that year, went on to play internationally for another nine years and had a full career which now sees him as the highly respected coach of Ireland.

When his Test career came to an end in 1997, nine years after the incident which almost claimed his life, Simmons had played in 26 matches for West Indies, the same number of appearances Hughes has made for Australia.

‘I was the same age as Phil Hughes and a fit young man like him, which I think can make a big difference,’ Simmons told Sportsmail from Dubai, where Ireland are preparing for the World Cup. ‘The big thing for me was my wife,’ said Simmons. ‘She would not allow any negativity about my situation. Everything had to be positive. I was going to pull through and I was going to play for the West Indies again.

‘She didn’t let me read any of the stuff which said I might not make it, so it never entered my head. It was only later when I realised quite how severe it all was.’

The concern for Simmons, who was playing for the West Indies tourists of 1988 against Gloucestershire, was just as acute as that for poor Hughes, whose condition remains critical in a Sydney hospital.

He was hit on the back of the head playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the SCG.

‘My injury was as serious as can be,’ said Simmons who, unlike Hughes, was not wearing a helmet at the time of his horrific accident. ‘My heart stopped and I had a clot removed from my brain. I was in a long-term head unit in hospital in Bristol and no-one expected me to play again but I was out in eight days. I really hope this kid pulls through.’

The only difference between the two incidents is that Simmons’s injury could have been avoided had he been wearing a protective helmet but Hughes was the victim of a freak occurrence, with the ball from New South Wales medium-fast bowler Sean Abbott hitting him on the back of his head below his helmet. ‘Phil is so unlucky,’ said Simmons.

‘It’s a million to one shot that someone will be hit where he was and you can’t blame the helmet. They have improved dramatically since my day and the reality is that there will always be a risk in cricket. It’s just one of those things that can happen, like it did to me.’

Simmons was hit by one of the fastest bowlers around at that time in ‘Syd’ Lawrence, who was to suffer serious injury himself four years later, when his knee snapped in his delivery stride. The former England bowler is now a body builder.

‘I know how bowlers can be affected by this which is why everyone is rallying around Sean Abbott,’ said Simmons. ‘I had known Syd for a long time before the incident and we were good friends.

‘I was unconscious when he came to visit me in hospital in Bristol but my wife told me he had a tear running down his cheek when he held my hand. A bowler is never to blame. This is just something that can happen in our game but thankfully it is very rare.’

Simmons’s extraordinary recovery saw him playing again four months after the incident, while he resumed his career at the highest level — this time with a helmet — a year later.

‘Of course I was nervous when I first started playing again but facing fast bowling is what I did and it came back to me pretty quickly.

‘There is nothing we can all do other than pray for Phil Hughes. My wife rang me as soon as she heard what had happened to him because it brought it all back.

‘He is in the best possible hands and the doctors will be doing all they can for him. All we can do is hope he makes a full recovery. I am proof that it can happen.’
