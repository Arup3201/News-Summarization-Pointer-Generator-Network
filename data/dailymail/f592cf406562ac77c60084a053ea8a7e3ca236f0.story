Spanish retailer Mango has come under fire for selling a shirt decorated in lightning bolts that resemble an insignia worn by the SS and Hitler youths in Nazi Germany.

Twitter users, especially those in Germany, were up in arms after they spotted the resemblance, noting that the tiny black zig-zag lines on the $59.99 blouse look just like the Siegrune, a symbol used by the Schutzstaffel or SS, the Nazi party's protection squadron, during World War II.

Mango has since apologized, calling it an 'unfortunate association', but the criticism has continued to pour in.

Anti-Semitic? Spanish retailer Mango has come under fire for selling a shirt decorated in lightning bolts that resemble an insignia worn by the SS, a Nazi organization in World War II

Negative associations: The Siegrune (pictured in a 1940 recruitment poster for the Waffen SS, a wing of the Nazi party) was a common symbol on Nazi uniforms and on Nazi flags

One Twitter user called the shirt an 'epic #design fail,' while another branded it 'Nazi chic'.

A third person remarked: 'After Zara, the SS shirt by Mango,' referring to an incident in August, when Zara was forced to apologize for selling a striped T-shirt that appeared to resemble clothes warn by prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. 

'The Spanish have a despicable way to promote brands. Antisemitism sells,' he continued.

Others, however, were more skeptical of the similarity between the designs. 'LOL I see it but, really, it's a shirt,' said one person.

Sorry: Mango has since apologized, calling it an 'unfortunate association'. A statement reads: 'The RAYO blouse belongs to a collection inspired by mini-motifs... there are two other models which feature hearts and stars'

Offensive: Some critics sarcastically called the blouse 'Nazi chic'

A stretch? Others, however, were more skeptical of the similarity between the designs

Another Twitter user wrote in German: 'Sorry but what's going on in your head that you see everywhere Nazi symbols? Hitler is not in Mango but in your heads!'

More shoppers noted that if this shirt is considered offensive, the same can be said about the band Kiss's logo, or that of AC/DC.

Mango has since apologized for any offence caused, stating in a release: 'The RAYO blouse belongs to a collection inspired by mini-motifs. In the range there are two other models which feature hearts and stars.'

This isn't the first time a major retailer has been accused of selling apparel with anti-Semitic symbols; in October, Sears came under fire for featuring a ring with a Swastika on its Marketplace website.
