When the Danish prime minister was asked if she'd  reveal the controversial selfie she took at Nelson Mandela's memorial service she said, resoundingly, no.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt later told a Danish newspaper the photo was not 'particularly good' and sources have since revealed she wanted to delete it.

But, despite facing a barrage of criticism for posing in it, British Prime Minister David Cameron is taking a very different view.

It has emerged that during a private 
conversation last week, Cameron apparently suggested to the Dane that 
auctioning it for charity could raise a substantial sum.

For our eyes only: The controversial selfie,  pictured, will not be 
shared with the public, the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt
 said

A source familiar with the exchange told The Sunday Times: 'Helle wanted to delete it, but Cameron urged her not to. He pointed out that it could raise a lot of money.'

However, Downing Street refused to confirm if the conversation took place when contacted by MailOnline today or, if it did, what was said.

Thorning-Schmidt - who took the photo of herself, President Obama, and Mr Cameron during the service - did not reveal whether she would delete the image or just refrain from showing it to the public.

Speaking to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet, she said: 'It isn't a particularly good picture.'

The Danish prime minister previously defended the selfie saying that the trio of world leaders were just 'having a bit of fun'.

The selfie shot happened during the memorial service of South African former president Nelson Mandela at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on December 10

The selfie led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero

She added that the relaxed picture was in-keeping with the spirit of the event.

The
 Dane, who is married to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock's son 
Stephen, 42, has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country 
since becoming prime minister in 2011.

She said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit of fun.

'Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.'

In an interview with Danish Daily Berlinske, she
 added: 'There was a sadness, but it was basically a festive event that 
also celebrated a man who has lived for 95 years and achieved so much in
 his life.

'There was dancing on the stands. And then we took a really fun selfie.'

Obama, Cameron and Thorning-Schmidt were captured taking the picture at the FNB Stadium near Johannesburg on Tuesday, as thousands of mourners gathered to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela.

The photograph was taken shortly after
 President Obama gave a rousing speech about the former South African 
President and civil rights campaigner who died aged 95.

The White House has not commented on the photograph, but David Cameron this week brushed off the incident.

During
 Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons he said: 'In my 
defense, I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in
 his life and in his death in bringing people together.

So of course when a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it was only polite to say yes.'Â 

But the controversy is not going away as quickly as the world leaders would like.

It led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero.

Twitter user James Armitage wrote: 'What selfish morons take a "selfie" at a memorial service? Oh yeah that's right, Barack Obama and David Cameron.'

In a message directed at Mr Cameron, Sarah McDermott said: 'You have precisely zero class or decorum.'
