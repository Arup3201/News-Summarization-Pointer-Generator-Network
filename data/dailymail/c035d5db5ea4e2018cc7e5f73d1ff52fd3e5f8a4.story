Two journalists in Jordan have embarrassed their respective employers after they became embroiled in a fight live on air and completely destroyed the set.

Shaker Al-Johari and Mohammed Al-Jayousi were discussing the crisis in Syria when they disagreed about an issue and began hurling abuse at each other on TV channel 7 Stars.

As if the war of words wasn't embarrassing enough on live television, the pair then became physical - standing up and violently shoving the desk on set at each other until it collapsed.

Tempers flared: The two journalists became aggressive after accusing each other of supporting opposite sides of the Syrian government and had fight live on air  

The two men were appearing on a show called Between Opposing Opinions, presented by Zuhair Al-Azza.

Mr Al-Johari is the head of the Electronic Media Association in Jordan, while Mr Al-Jayousi is the editor-in-chief of news website al-Mustaqbal al-Arabi.

It is understood Mr Al-Johari attacked Mr Al-Jayousi for his support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

During their verbal stoush, Mr Al-Jayousi seemingly provoked his counterpart by accusing him of being 'deviant' and supporting the Syrian revolution.
