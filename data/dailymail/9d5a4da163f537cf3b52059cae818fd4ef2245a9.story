The Netherlands and Mexico became the first teams to take a drinks break during this year's World Cup after temperatures in Brazil reached 39C.

As temperatures rose in Fortaleza, the teams were given official three-minute 'cooling breaks' on the 30 and 75 minute marks to take in drinks at Estadio Castelao.

The extreme heat, which saw fans retreat to the back of the stands to avoid the sun, prompted fears over the suitability of Qatar as the 2022 tournament hosts, as temperatures there often approach 45C.

Water break: Holland take in three minutes to themselves in their game against Mexico

Portuguese referee Pedro
 Proenca was the first match official of this year's tournament to halt 
play for a mandatory water break, which ruling body FIFA said would be 
put in place should temperatures reach 32C or more. 

The three minutes, which also gave Mexico
 boss Miguel Herrera and Holland manager Louis van Gaal time to talk 
tactics with the teams, were added to stoppage time at the end of each half.

Van Gaal claimed he used the second one 
to change his tactics and bring about his team's eventual 2-1 victory.

The Dutch had come from a goal down against Mexico, winning a penalty deep in injury time with the scores level.

Time: The water breaks gave Miguel Herrera - still wearing his suit jacket despite the raging heat - three minutes to talk tactics with his players

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the penalty spot after Mexican captain Rafael Marquez was punished for his foul on Dutch winger Arjen Robben.

The new Manchester United manager said: ' First I had changed to 4-3-3 and we created a lot of opportunities.

'Then I moved to plan B and yes I did that in the cooling break. That’s a clever way of benefiting from these breaks.'

This is the first World Cup where cooling breaks have been used, with each venue's medical teams monitoring the temperatures at pitch level and employing breaks if the mercury rises above 32C.

Referees can decide when to stop play in order for the players to take on water and cool down.

The breaks would certainly be needed in Qatar, given temperatures can 
rise to a worrying 50 degrees between May and September, and has been as high as 53C.

It has been argued that such heat would prove dangerous for both players and supporters, while the area can also be subjected to sandstorms during the dry season.

If the tournament was moved to the winter, as has been proposed, the temperature would be likely to be between the mid 20s and 30s.

Prior to yesterday's match, both teams had been forced to switch training venues because FIFA deemed the pitch at Estadio 
Castelao unable to cope with two practice sessions and a match in two 
days.

The Dutch coach had warned before the last-16 game that players may have hallucinated were they not allowed to take on water during the match.

‘If
 we have to, we will take drinks and put bottles round the pitch. It is 
extremely important and that is why a dehydration element was included 
in training and friendlies,' he said.

‘Every player will become dehydrated. Some lose four litres during the game. That is four kilos.

‘They
 have to replenish otherwise they will start hallucinating. The players 
know this.'

Elsewhere, though, former England and Manchester 
United defender Rio Ferdinand joined in, taking to social 
media to show off a selfie of himself taking his own drinks break.

But one man who the seemed to not be bothered by the heat was Herrera, who kept his suit jacket on throughout as he watched his team concede two goals in as many minutes to crash out.

Herrera, the least-paid manager at the World Cup on £125,000-a-year, coped well with the heat since the tournament began, leading Mexico out of a tough Group A at the expense of Croatia and Cameroon.
