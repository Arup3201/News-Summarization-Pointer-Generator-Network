A banker shot his estranged wife dead in the street before turning the gun on himself in front of their two young children on Halloween during a custody exchange.

Scott Gimbel, 50, and Linda Sachs Gimbel, 44, were found outside an apartment block in Mission Viejo, Orange County, California, at 8.30pm on Friday.

It is believed one was handing their 13-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son to the other in a custody exchange.

Attack: Scott Gimbel, left, shot his estranged wife Linda Sachs Gimbel, right, in an Orange County parking lot during a custody exchange. He then killed himself as their daughter, 13, and son, seven, watched from the car

Tragic: The family, pictured, had allegedly become embroiled in a custody dispute in recent months 

Dispute: They were together as recently as December 2013 before an apparent separation and custody dispute

But as the children sat in the car, Mr Gimbel, senior vice president of a leading mortgage lending firm PFI Financial Inc, opened fire.

Mrs Sachs Gimbel, an accounting executive at Citadel Services Corp, was killed instantly,reports claim, before Scott then killed himself.

Their 13-year-old daughter called 911. 

The family was pictured together as recently as December last year before an apparent separation sparked the alleged custody dispute. 

A high-flying couple, both Mr Gimbel and Mrs Sachs Gimbel have extensive experience in the financial services industry.

Mrs Sachs Gimbel worked as a sales manager at Deutsche Bank before joining Citywide Mortgage Corporation, which Scott founded, as senior operations manager.

High flyers: Linda, 44, was a successful accounting executive and Scott, 50, founded a leading mortgage firm

Shooting: Their bodies were found at 8.30pm in the street after their daughter called 911 from the car

Tribute: Linda's sister Leigh, pictured right, and friends have paid tribute to the 44-year-old as 'smart and funny'

Mr Gimbel was educated at Indiana University Bloomington. He founded Citywide in 1999, and by 2005 it was one of the largest mortgage brokerage firms in the country.

Paying tribute to Linda, her friend Jamie Melim wrote on Facebook: 'My heart aches at the loss of a beautiful friend.

'She was smart, amazing and sooo funny! She was tragically taken from this world last night. 

'She left behind two young children and a family that absolutely adored her. 

Exchange: The children were sat in a car by this Mission Viejo apartment block when Scott opened fire

'Please pray for her family tonight and for my dear friend Leigh Ann as she is trying to cope with the loss of her beloved sister.'

Her sister Leigh Ann Sachs posted a picture of herself with Linda and their father, commenting that she didn't have the words to express her feelings.

She wrote to a friend: 'Thank you for posting that beautiful tribute to Linda. I just couldn't do it.'
