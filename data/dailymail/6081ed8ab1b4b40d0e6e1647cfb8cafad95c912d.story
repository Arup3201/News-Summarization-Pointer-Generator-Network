Denmark's Sebastian Cappelen in his first PGA Tour event is the leader of the Sanderson Farms Championship following an opening round seven under par 65 in Mississippi.

With 40 of the World's top 50 players competing at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, it was expected that one of the nine former champions in the field would make their mark, but it the 24-year-old who is setting the pace.

Cappelen began with a bogey, but made eight birdies, shooting five under on the front nine and finished with a tricky par to finish two clear of the rest.

'I'm so happy, I couldn't be happier,' Cappelen, told the Golf Channel.

'I came here just trying to get a new experience, trying to get a feel for how it feels to play on the real tour.

'I had a great time out there today and hit a lot of great shots. It was fun. I'll try to just keep that going, take that with me into tomorrow.'

Cappelen made eight birdies in his opening round of the Sanderson Farms Championship

American pair Robert Streb and Scott Pinckney as well as Canadian Nick Taylor are on five under, with Streb's bogey at the last a frustrating end to what had been up to then, a blemish-free round.

Pinckney dropped shots at eight and 17, following birdies from 14 through 16, while Taylor did not register a bogey.

Nine players, including David Duval and Ben Curtis are a further shot back on four under par, while defending champion Woody Austin shot a 70.
