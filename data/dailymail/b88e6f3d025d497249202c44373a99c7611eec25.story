Antique watches worth more than £200,000 which date back to the 17th century have been stolen in an evening raid.

The haul of 16 watches were taken from a house in Beckenham, south east London, along with a BMW car.

The car was founded dumped in south London two days later, but there was no sign of the watches.

These two watches alone are said to be worth £27,000. Left, is the Reeve timepiece dating back to 1630 and valued at approximately £15,000. Right, is a De St Leu, valued at approximately £12,000 from 1765

These are two Breguet watches, with the one on the left worth £15,000 and the one on the right valued at £10,000 

Another set of Breguet watches, which were taken. The watch on the left is worth £15,000, while the one on the right is valued at £12,000

The timepieces include a number of French and English watches made by the 'highest end watchmakers out there'.

It also includes a Reeve timepiece, which dates back to 1630, and is worth around £15,000 alone.

Simon Kerby, an antiques watch specialist from the Gerald E. Marsh dealership in Hampshire said: 'This was obviously a very good collection.

'A lot of the watches are classic English and French makers who are also famous clock makers. These are the highest end watchmakers out there.

'The list includes many of the top names. Breguet is going to be up there as one of the best.

Among the watches taken in the haul was this Fromanteel timepiece from 1690, which is valued at £6,000

A Quare & Horseman watch, from 1705, worth £7,500 and this K. J Everell, valued at £5,000  from 1705 were also taken in the raid

Together these two watch, a Lampe timepiece, left, and a Lupton watch, right, are worth a total of £16,500. They were both included in the haul taken from the house in Beckenham, south London

'They would have been making watches since the 1700s, and some of their pieces are astonishing.”

He added: “It would be difficult to sell them as a single lot in auction.

'They could possibly be sold abroad. The pocket watch collecting community is very small, there are really very few people who collect them.

'If someone came in here with a collection like that we would really want to know when they were last sold.

'I would also want to know when and how they were acquired. It would be very likely they had come up in an auction like Christie’s or Sotheby’s.

'You would have to be very careful where you sell them if you didn’t want to alert suspicion.'

The Windmill, left from 1720, valued at approximately £6,500 while this Boucheret timepiece also from the 1700s is said to be worth £6,000

This timepiece from Tompion dates back to 1710 and is said to be worth £5,000

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that watches had been stolen.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A burglary was committed at a property in Beckenham, on Tuesday, March 4 between 5.45pm and 10.10pm during which in excess of 16 antique watches were stolen, along with a BMW.

'The car was subsequently recovered in Verney Road, Southwark on March 6.'

Mr Kerby added: 'As an antique watch collector myself, security is a concern.'

'It’s something you do have to be very wary.'
