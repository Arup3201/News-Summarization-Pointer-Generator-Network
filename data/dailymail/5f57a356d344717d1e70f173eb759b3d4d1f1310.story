A pair of twin sisters who found out they were pregnant on the same day have given birth to their babies on the same day in the same hospital.

Erica and Tashina Ackley, who celebrate their 22nd birthdays this week, delivered just hours apart on Friday at Down East Community Hospital in Machias, Maine.

Tashina gave birth to a 6lbs 11oz girl named Ivory Mae Cushing, while Erica gave birth to a 6lb boy named Keiran Leighton Carter.

Ivory was born at 8.54am with her little cousin born just hours later before noon.

'We thought it would be cool if we had our babies on the same day, but we didnâ€™t expect that it would happen,' Tashina told the Bangor Daily News.

Her sister added: 'We
took pregnancy tests together and found out we were pregnant on the 
same day, and we did every [prenatal] appointment together.'

The
twins - who have matching 'Twin 1' and 'Twin 2' tattoos - also broke 
the news of their pregnancies to their mother, Mary, on the same day. 
Erica went first.

'I waited a few hours,' Tashina said. 'Then I asked my mother if she would like to have a baby in each arm 
again, like she did with us. She had no idea what I meant until I told 
her I was pregnant, too.'

The new mothers have returned home to Eastport with their healthy babies.

The newborns are the women's first children.

On Sunday, Erica revealed on Facebook: 'So excited! Couldn't sleep so went to the nursery to check on my sweet boy. He ate soooo good during the night, I'm so happy... Can't wait to be home!'
