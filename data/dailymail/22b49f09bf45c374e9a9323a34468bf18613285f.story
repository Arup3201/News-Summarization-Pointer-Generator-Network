Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in an interview released Monday morning that Americans should prepare themselves for the country to be at war with the Islamic State and other terrorist groups for decades to come. 

'I think we're looking at kind of a 30-year war,' he told USA Today in an interview to promote his new book, Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace, which comes out on Tuesday.

Threats posed by emerging terrorist networks in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and other countries will keep the U.S. military engaged for the foreseeable future, he forewarned. The fight will not end when the U.S. defeats ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the former Pentagon official said.

In his upcoming memoir Panetta, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, rehashes the foreign policy decisions made President Barack Obama during his four-year tenor in his administration, including Obama's judgement call not to leave troops in Iraq after the conclusion of the U.S. occupation of the country.

That 'created a vacuum in terms of the ability of that country to better protect itself, and it's out of that vacuum that ISIS began to breed,' Panetta told USA Today.

Obama's decision not to confront Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with military force after previously warning that he would face consequences if he crossed a 'red line' by using chemical weapons on his citizens was also a mistake, Panetta said.

The former Obama administration official told USA Today the backtrack harmed Obama's credibility internationally. Standing up to Islamic extremists now could give Obama a chance to 'repair the damage,' Panetta said, after having 'lost his way.'  

Panetta's criticism of the Commander in Chief comes as allies of the president on Capitol Hill have begun to call his handling of the situations in Iraq and Syria, as well other terrorist hot spots, into question, as well. 

On Sunday Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat eyeing a 2016 presidential run, argued that no president, including Obama, has 'had a clear articulation of what American foreign policy is basically since the end of the Cold War.

'Looking at places like Iraq and Syria, you’re seeing policies that can’t be clearly articulated,' Webb said on NBC's Meet the Press.

'It’s not just about ISIS,' Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey said Sunday during an interview on New York radio station 970 AM.

'This is a global jihad with many locations ... Nigeria, Somalia and elsewhere where organizations have sworn themselves to kill as many Muslims, Christians and Jews as they can to establish their religious order,' the Democratic senator said, according to The Hill.

Kerrey argued that the United States 'underestimated the threat of a global jihad.'

'ISIS is just a part of it,' he said. 'This is a global jihad that comes out of the Muslim religion. Our intelligence underestimated the threat, and the president did as well.'

Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in questioning the wisdom of President Obama's policies in a barrage of attacks on the Sunday morning news shows.

Referencing Obama's repeated claims that he will not send American combat forces into Iraq, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, 'I don't think we should ever sit back and tell our enemies what we will and will not do.

'If we need special forces there - if that's what the generals say- then we need to do it,' McCarthy said on CBS' Face the Nation.

'If we engage in a conflict that we know this is a threat to America, we should make it so one-sided that it gets over very quickly. So, we should have everything on the table to make sure we win this.'

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham argued on CNN's State of the Union that he too thought Obama erred in promising not to put boots on the ground. 

'There is no way I can see how we’re going to fix the problem in Iraq in Syria without American ground troops,' Graham said, according to Politico.

'This mythical Arab army we’re trying to get up to go in on the ground in Syria will need a lot of American hand-holding.'

Both men were referring to comments made by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, suggesting that the U.S. may not be able to defeat ISIS without using its own ground troops because the Iraqi army is ill equipped to fight the terrorist group.

New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, another Republican, expressed worry on Sunday that the president isn't planning on destroying the the violent extremist group at all, even though he's assured the public that he will.

'I’m fearful that as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the November elections and that he won’t have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy ISIS,' she said. 

Despite his negative assessment of Obama's recent choices, Panetta told USA Today he still believes the president can still turn the situation around, not just for the country, but for himself during his remaining time in office.

'He may have found himself again with regards to this ISIS crisis. I hope that's the case,' Panetta said.

'And if he's willing to roll up his sleeves and engage with Congress in taking on some of these other issues, as I said I think he can establish a very strong legacy as president.

'I think these next 2 1/2 years will tell us an awful lot about what history has to say about the Obama administration,' he concluded.
