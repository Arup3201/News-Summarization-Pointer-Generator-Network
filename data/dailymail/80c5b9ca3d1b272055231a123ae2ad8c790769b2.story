Hoax: The boy, Alexander Jordan, never existed, and photos posted on a Facebook page were actually of a young South African cancer victim, pictured

When students at a Colorado high school heard about a nine-year-old boy who was dying from leukemia they wanted to help, raising money and dedicating a football game to the brave youngster.

But it has since been revealed little 'Alex Jordan' never existed and was instead an elaborate hoax a 22-year-old woman allegedly created to dupe an entire community.

Students at Eagle Valley High School in Gypsum thought little Alexander was battling terminal leukemia, and a special Facebook page detailing hospital visits and treatments suggested this was the case.

It all began two weeks ago when Briana Augustenborg told colleague, Holly 
Sandoval, the mother of an Eagle Valley High football 
player, of the fake child's ordeal.

Teary-eyed, Ms Sandoval offered to get a signed football for 'Alex' who was supposedly a huge football fan.

'I
dragged my son into this and I feel terrible about it,' Ms Sandoval 
told the Vail Daily. 'I just wanted this little boy to be happy if these
were his final days.'

The story quickly spread that the nine-year-old was desperate to see an Eagle Valley High football game, so the school dedicated its October 26 match to the youngster.

'It was such a big thing to support this little kid that was near death,' student Jayden Mosness told 9News.

The entire student body and the football team - the Devils - donned orange to honour the boy, but he never made it. Students were told he'd died the day before the big game.

'The football players had orange socks and orange stickers on their helmets,' Mr Mosness said. 'For the dance team, their dance at halftime, they spelled out Alex's name on the field.'

An obituary appeared in the local newspaper that read: 'Out beautiful angel Alexander Jordan lost his two-year battle with leukemia on Thursday at the age of 9. Alex was born in Denver to Peter and Karen on November 2, 2002. He is Survived by his brother Nick and honorary brother Zeke.'

But after the no-show, some local residents became suspicious and took the story to Eagle Police Department on Friday where investigators quickly determined 'Alex' didn't exist by searching for his death certificate.

Photos of the boy posted on the Facebook page, which by Saturday had more than 1,000 likes, were actually revealed to be a young South African cancer suffer who is still alive. They had been stolen from a kids cancer charity website.

Investigators are now questioning Ms Augustenborg over the made up little boy. The students organised a fund raiser for
Alexander but Ms Augustenborg never asked for money nor she did she 
receive any, according to the TV station.

Heartfelt response: 'It was such a big thing to support this little kid that was near death,' said student Jayden Mosness

Parents like Kathy Rohlwing were moved by the student's reaction to the heartbreaking story.

'This is a very caring, giving community,' Ms Rohlwing told 9News. 'It's like family. When they hear somebody has a need, they go all out.'

But the kids feel like they've been conned.

'It's not right. I don't think it's right for anybody to do that, to even joke about something this big,' Mr Mosness said.

'I feel like we were kind of played because everyone was in on it. Even our principal, he played a big part in it.'

He added: 'We were trying to think of why she would do it. She's kind of messed up to come up with such a sad story, basically broke the heart of a lot of people.'

Ms Rohlwing said she prayed for the person behind the hoax.

'Apparently, she lacks so much in her life that she would do something like this,' she said.
