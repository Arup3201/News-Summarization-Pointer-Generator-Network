Prominent civil activist Cornel West has been arrested in Ferguson, Missouri as more than 1,000 people march through the city to rally against police violence. 

The Princeton University philosopher and author was hauled away in handcuffs as protesters called for the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown in August.

He was one of at least 50 detained by officers at the demonstrations which went on late into the night. 

Ahead of his arrest, West told a crowd at Saint Louis University on Monday: 'It's a beautiful thing to see people on fire for justice but I didn't come here to give a speech. I came here to go to jail.'

He added that he wanted to help the black youth get their voices heard.

'The larger system has been victimizing and coming at them,' he said.

West joined hundreds of protesters taking part in the 'Ferguson October' rally. The Rev. Osagyefo Sekou, a Boston-based minister and activist, was also arrested, MSNBC reported.

The protesters are calling for the arrest of a white police officer, Darren Wilson, who killed  Brown. Last week, another black teenager, Vonderrit Myers Jr., also died at the hands of a white police officer - further inflaming tensions.

On Sunday, at least 17 protesters were arrested by police in riot gear for refusing to disperse during a spontaneous sit-in at a convenience store. Officers said protesters threw rocks, while cops responded with pepper spray, witnesses said.

Just hours later, on Monday morning, hundreds of protesters  descended on Saint Louis University campus  and announced they were there to stay.

The shootings - which police say came after altercations with the young men - have cast a spotlight on the state of race relations in the U.S. two years after black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot dead by a Florida neighborhood watch officer in another high-profile incident in 2012.

This morning's march on the university campus - which was far larger than previous overnight marches in Ferguson - was the first of what was expected to be a series of acts of civil disobedience around the region on Monday, the New York Times reported. 

As they walked through the streets, they shouted: 'Indict, convict, put the killer cops in jail, the whole damn system is guilty as hell.'

When they reached the campus, they announced they were staging a sit-in. 

'As of right now, this is our spot,' a protest leader beside the clock tower on the campus said at 2am on Monday. 'We're not going anywhere. This is our land. Everybody get comfortable.'

Vonderrit Myers Sr., whose son was shot dead in Shaw last Wednesday, told the crowd, 'You make my heart easier,' before he held a four-minute moment of silence.

Sunday's arrests were in the same neighborhood where the second shooting occurred.   

St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said 17 people
had been arrested for unlawful assembly early on Sunday at the
parking lot of the QuikTrip convenience store.

But Mervyn Marcano, who is handling media relations for a group
that provides jail support for protesters, said at least 19
people had been arrested. 

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tweeted that protesters were throwing rocks at the police - but the 
protesters responded on Twitter that they had not thrown anything.

Witnesses transmitting live video from the small overnight
protest in the Shaw neighborhood - where Myers was gunned down - showed a few dozen
people sitting on the ground outside the convenience store.

Thousands of people took to the streets of the midwestern US city of St Louis to protest police tactics in the wake of the racially charged shooting of an unarmed black teenager

Defense: Civil rights organizations and people from around the country are in St Louis for the protests

Witnesses said some people were hit with pepper spray and what appeared tohave been tear gas, though that could not be confirmed. 

Last Wednesday, an off-duty white officer working for a
security firm shot dead 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr. in the
Shaw neighborhood in what police described as a firefight.

There were no reports of arrests at protest rallies on
Saturday that drew thousands of people.

The police have largely
adopted a non-confrontational stance and protest organizers work
to maintain order and a non-violent approach. 

The mother of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shot dead onAugust 9 by white officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, walked at thefront of a rally on Saturday evening in the suburb of Ferguson.

Second death: Vonderrit Myers Jr., 18, was shot dead by an off-duty police officer in Shaw last Wednesday

Taunts: Demonstrators taunt officers in riot gear as they protest the shooting death of Brown in August

A group of about 200 marched on a QT (QuikTrip) in the Grove district, where some briefly staged a sit-in. A police car was attacked, prompting at least 10 arrests, and tear gas was released to disperse the crowd 

Lesley McSpadden, who has criticized Ferguson police, has
only rarely participated in protests. She eventually left the
group, which grew to over 1,000 people and moved on to Ferguson
police headquarters.

Brown's death triggered a national uproar in August over
police accountability and protesters have called for the arrest
and prosecution of Wilson. A grand jury is
now considering the case.

At the culmination of the Ferguson march on Saturday night,
protesters shouted insults at a line of police in helmets and
shields, with some demonstrators wearing bandanas or scarves
over their faces. But there were no arrests or violence, a
police spokesman said. 

Fighting back: The two deaths have cast a spotlight on fraught race relations in the United States 

Not giving up: People march in protest of the shootings on Saturday during the weekend of rallys

Marching on: Another image shows protesters outside the Ferguson Police Department on Friday

Earlier on Saturday, thousands of protesters in downtown St.
Louis marched and rallied at a plaza, where organizers included
Hands Up United, an activist group that emerged after Brown's
death.

Union members, gay rights activists and people from the
Occupy movement joined in.

Civil rights organizations and
protest groups had invited people from across the United States 
to join vigils and other weekend events in the St. Louis area.

'This isn't going to stop until there is change with police
and black youth,' said Tory Russell, a founder of Hands Up
United.
