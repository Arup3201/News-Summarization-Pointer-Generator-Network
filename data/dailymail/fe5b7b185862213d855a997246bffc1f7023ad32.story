A senior teacher is being made redundant in Dundee after councillors refused to reduce their drinks budget by £44,000. 

Norma Seith is set to lose her post at the Menzieshill Young Mum's Unit (YMU) - which helps teenage mothers stay in education.

Ms Seith is principal teacher and manager of the organisation, which provides support to young 'fragile' women  who 'have seen their lives  become very, complicated'.

Teacher Norma Seith is set to lose her post at the Menzieshill Young Mum's Unit in Dundee after councillors refused to reduce their drinks budget by £44,000

The SNP administration has refused to cut their drinks budget despite the alternative being the removal of Ms Seith from her post.

More than 1,000 people have now signed a petition urging the council to reverse their decision and opposition groups rallied round the unit today, proposing a series of alternative savings, The Courier reports.

Derek Scott, the Conservative member for Broughty Ferry, suggested slashing food and refreshment for councillors, alcohol purchases and hospitality budgets.

He claimed that by saving £44,000 in the entertainment allowance, the council could afford to employ the principal teacher at the YMU.

However, his motion was defeated by SNP members who pushed ahead with their proposals — and Labour councillors who declined to vote.

Clare McGraw, whose daughter uses the YMU, told members at today's meeting that the unit was crucial in helping those who become pregnant while in education. 

She said: 'Any changes to the YMU should be done with care and attention, given the crucial support it provides.

'(Education convener) Stewart Hunter has already said to me that the planning could have been better.

'The principal teacher has been there for 24 years and is essential as a relationship with those involved in the unit. This amounts to a dismantling of the YMU.'

SNP finance spokesman Councillor Willie Sawers said: 'This is the ninth year in a row that the council tax has been frozen in Dundee.

'Within the savings proposed for council services, we have made absolutely every effort we can to protect the quality of the services we provide.'

On their website, the YMU says it 'caters for the extra needs of pregnant schoolgirls and young mothers with their babies from across the city. 

'The unit is staffed by a Principal Teacher, supported by a designated YMU support worker and two qualified Early Years Practitioners.'

Ms Seith was unavailable for comment today.

Speaking to the Evening Telegraph last month, the teacher spoke of the crucial work that the YMU do in helping young mothers.

She said: 'The emphasis is on continuing the girls' education. But there's also input from us on parenting skills, nutrition and many other aspects of motherhood.

'And whilst some girls have been around other children — brothers, sisters, cousins — others are terrified at the prospect of being a mum.'
