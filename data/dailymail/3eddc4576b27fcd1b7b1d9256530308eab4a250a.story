Australian military forces have completed their first armed combat mission in northern Iraq overnight, the Chief of Defence has confirmed via Twitter. 

No bombs were dropped in the first mission which saw two F/A-18F Super Hornets leave a military base in Dubai to take out Islamic State targets.

The jets flew around northern Iraq for seven hours but it's believed they did not locate the targets and no munitions were used.

The jets then returned safely to Dubai, Chief of Defence Mark Binskin confirmed on Monday morning.

'On this occasion the aircraft did not use their munitions and have returned to base to disarm and prepare for future sorties,' a Department of Defence statement said.

'Australian Special Forces await Iraqi government approval to commence advice and assist operations in Iraq.

'Australia's efforts are in response to a request for assistance by the Iraqi Government in combating ISIL terrorists,' the statement added.

The news comes after it was confirmed hundreds of Australian troops could be on the ground in Iraq as soon as Tuesday as the Federal Government moves to snuff the growing threat of the terror group.

A fleet six super hornet fighter jets have already made their way to the Middle East for non-combat reconnaissance and intelligence operations.

A source within the Department of Defence said there could be as many as 200 soldiers on the ground within days,The Daily Telegraph reported.

Approval for personnel to start training the local army to defend themselves against Islamic State is expected to be given by the end of the week.

Authorities have warned a 'long campaign' lies ahead for forces in Iraq, with the recently deployed Air Task Group of F/A 18 jets thought to be the largest since the Vietnam War.

They joined aircraft and tanker transportation already operating in the Middle East.

Defence Minister David Johnston said the government was 'optimistic' that they could quell the threat of Islamic State quickly.

But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here.

'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.'

Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War.

It comes after Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop claimed the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq.

Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September.

'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said.

The aircraft were equipped with a 20mm cannon, GPS-guided munitions, laser-guided munitions, sidewinder heat-seeking missiles and radar-guided missiles

Supporting this mission and other Coalition aircraft was a RAAF E-7A Wedgetail Early Warning and Control aircraft and a KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft which are assigned to the Australian Air Task Group (ATG)

On Saturday, the foreign affairs minister said sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,'

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' Ms Bishop told The Sunday Times.

'ISIS and similar organisations are not only threatening the people of Iraq and beyond, but Australia,' she said. 

'There have been a number of videos where Australia has specifically been mentioned as a terrorist target.'

'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.'

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State.

A further three-quarters of voters also believed the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil was real.

Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday.

Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, Ms Bishop said.

'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' she said.

'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies. 

'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.'

Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'.
