A royal fanatic with more than 650 pieces of memorabilia has had her crowning glory after being named one of Britain’s top royal fans.

For nearly half a century, Cynthia Lewis, 67, has collected anything which features the royals - including books, magazines, paper weights, plaques, cups and saucers, and statues.

And now her patriotic collection - which she has crammed into her tiny bungalow in Blackpool, Lancashire - has landed her a top spot in the Royal Mint’s competition to find Britain’s Ultimate Royal Fan.

Ms Lewis, who is one of five to have been shortlisted, will find out this week if she has won the Ultimate Royal competition - and the coveted prize of Gold Proof Diamond Jubilee coin, worth £2,400.

She fell in love with the royal family while reading about them in her mother’s bookshop as a child.

The royal admirer bought her first item of memorabilia shortly before the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, in 1977, and admits her collection has since 'spiralled out of control'.

She said: 'I just love the royal family, I always have. It was like watching a soap opera when I was growing up, they were such a lovely family - all the girls and the clothes, it just appealed to me.

'I used to get really quite emotional just reading the books, they were wonderful.

'I think I’ve got 500 books, magazines and papers and then about 150 other pieces of memorabilia.

'I’ve got the books, cups and little plaques and plates, I’ve got some nice big plates, and saucers - really nice expensive ones.'

Ms Lewis, who works as a carer, doesn’t know the exact value of her vast collection but says it is priceless because of what it means to her.

After seeing an advert for the competition, called the ‘Ultimate Royal’ in a national paper, she just had to showcase her years of hard work.

She said: 'I’ve got a lot of it from charity shops, so I don’t know how much I’ve spent. The price is irrelevant because they mean that much to me. I love the Queen.

'Whenever I’d buy a book, I’d have to sit down and read it and look at all the lovely pictures.

To show her love of the royals, Cynthia even wrote a poem all about her collection...

It’s not just collecting; it’s my passion, my pleasure.

I’ve hundreds of books full of memories I treasure,

All things royal, my secret obsession.

My books are my pride my favourite possession.

Some collect stamps, medals or gold, I collect books full of stories to be told.

Having a new princess has filmed me with hope, a new generation, my very own soap.

Twenty twelve a year full of elation, around every corner a new celebration.

Sixty years of a wonderful queen, and I would just like to say God Save Our Queen.

'I always say when I retire I’m going to sit down and read all my books.'

Ms Lewis added: 'I was brought up in a bookshop and I would love to read the books but I could never keep any of them.

'I used to read all the royal ones.

'I always said when I was older I would buy my own books to read and keep and I did.

'My mother loved the royal family; she called my sister Margaret Rose after Princess Margaret.

'I think the first piece I got was in 1977 for the Jubilee.

'It was a book - it was one on the Queen as a child and Princess Margaret.

'I told people I loved the book and they started to buy me other things - everything they’d find to do with the royals they would send on to me and my collection built up like that.

'And if I see something at a car boot or a charity shop, I couldn’t possibly carry on. I have to buy them.'

Although Ms Lewis understands not everyone shares her love of the royal family, she hopes that will soon change because of the Duchess of Cambridge - or ‘Katie’ as she affectionately refers to her.

She explained: 'I don’t talk about Diana much; I think a lot of people moved away from the royals because of that. But I think Katie will bring them back.

'I used to love looking at the young children and I think that will happen again with Katie and William.

'A lot of people think she’s trying to be Diana but she’s her own individual and she’s very open.

'I like to see Katie and William holding hands and being nice to one another, it’s unusual for royals.

'The Queen is my favourite ever since she was such a young girl on her first tour.

'Then she lost her mother and sister and then the trouble with the divorces and Diana dying.

'The Queen's had to come to the 21st century now and put up with divorce and she’s forgotten all the things she used to do many years ago.'
