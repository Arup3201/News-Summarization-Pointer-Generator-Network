Manuel Pellegrini accepts success in the Champions League is key to keeping hold of star players such as Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero, but the Manchester City manager insists the English champions are not ‘obsessed’ with winning the competition.

City are aiming to seal a place in the last eight for the first time but find their path blocked by a familiar foe in Barcelona, who they play in the last-16 on Tuesday. The Catalan club knocked Pellegrini’s team out at the same stage last season.

City have won the Barclays Premier League twice in three seasons but Pellegrini concedes that to satisfy the desires of his stellar talent, progress in Europe must be made.

‘It’s important to grow in both competitions - in your league and be involved in the last stage of the Champions League.

‘It’s not an obsession to win the Champions League. We can do it but next year the target would be the same - to try to improve in every competition.’

Already eliminated from both domestic cup competitions, ending the season without a trophy is an unwelcome but realistic prospect for City.

Their five-point deficit to Chelsea in the Premier League means their chances of retaining the title is out of their hands and, in Europe, they face a club that have reached at least the quarter-finals in every season since 2007.

Pellegrini, however, says he does not feel his employment status hinges solely on delivering silverware.

‘I never feel pressure, just my own pressure to try to improve,’ he said.

‘We could win five titles in two years but that doesn’t mean for the next three years I could do what I want.

‘We can win the Champions League this year and next year there will be the same targets.

‘My own pressure is to improve, I’m not depending on winning one thing. That’s not the way I think.’

City had a player sent off in each leg as they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate last season by Gerardo Martino’s Barca.

This season, Luis Enrique is the coach against whom Pellegrini will pit his wits as he attempts to steer the nouveau riche English club into unchartered waters.

Despite being relative newcomers to the competition, Pellegrini believes his players have no reason to feel inferior against the four-time winners, especially after beating German giants Bayern Munich in the group stages of the last two tournaments.

‘If we beat Bayern Munich, we can also beat Barcelona,’ Pellegrini said. ‘We did it last year and this year. It’s not a mental problem, it’s a strong team.

‘It’s very important not to make the mistakes that we made last year.’
