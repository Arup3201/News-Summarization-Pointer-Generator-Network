A heartless thief has stolen a four-wheel-drive from a terminally ill cancer sufferer who was on the eve of kicking off the first leg of his bucket list trip - driving along the coastline of Australia.

Steve Hughes and his partner, Lynne Woodcock, woke on Wednesday morning to find their 1997 Toyota Landcruiser - his most prized possession - had been pinched.

In December, the Darwin father was diagnosed with small-cell cancer and has as little as six months to live.

Small-cell cancer means it can appear anywhere in the body.

Steve Hughes was diagnosed with terminal cancer in December, and he and his partner were about set off on a bucket list trip before their 4WD was taken by thieves

The couple started planning the trip the day after Mr Hughes was diagnosed.

'What I have is terminal so it's just a matter of time,' he said.

'So the plan is to live life to the fullest while I've got it.'

The car was taken from the house of Mr Hughes' mother in Morphett Vale in Adelaide - where the couple was staying while he was undergoing radiotherapy treatment to prevent the cancer travelling to his brain.

Mr Hughes thinks the thieves got in through the back passenger window because the only evidence left of the car was pieces of glass on the ground. He believes they were professionals because they made minimal noise when they took the car.

'I just think they're mongrels and I'd like my knuckles to do the talking to be honest,' Mr Hughes told A Current Affair.

Mr Hughes spent six months researching the purchase of his 1997 Toyota Landcruiser

Mr Hughes said he had spent six months searching for the perfect Landcruiser.

'We finally found the one in Victoria that was perfect so I flew down and bought it the next morning and drove it back up to Darwin with it,' he said.

'During [cancer] treatment process, we put all the bells and whistles and winches and all the rest of it on.'

Ms Woodcock told MailOnline they were gutted by the incident that saw thousands of dollars worth of equipment and personal items lost.

'We had our whole life in there. We just had every day things in there like I went to put on my coat today but it was taken as well as my shoes, our camera gear and camping gear. They are all gone,' she said.

'[The thieves] are just the scum of the earth – just the scum of society.'

The 4WD was the father-of-one's most prized possession

The couple have received a call from Australian 4WD Action magazine who say they will donate a new one to replace the Landcruiser (pictured)

But restoring their faith in humanity, the couple received a phone call from Australian 4WD Action magazine on Thursday who said they would donate a new vehicle to them.

'We’re just overwhelmed - that’s just amazing,' Ms Woodcock said.

'If we had to wait for insurance to come through that’s more time off the road and we don’t have that much time.'

The couple will soon make their way toward Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and then to down to the southern regions of Western Australia, near the Margaret River.

If anyone has information regarding the 4WD, call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
