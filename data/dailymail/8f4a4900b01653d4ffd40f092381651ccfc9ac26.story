Evil: Anders Breivik details in his manifesto that he intended to use poison bullets during his killing spree

Anders Breivik could have used ‘chemically enhanced’ ammunition to ensure every shot was deadly, police believe.

In his disturbing ‘manifesto’ he talked of plans to put liquid nicotine in his bullets.

If the blast did not kill victims outright, the nicotine would go on to poison them.

It was already known that Breivik used ‘dum-dum’ bullets during his killing spree – the expanding round has a hollow point which leaves a large exit wound after causing horrific wounds.

In his 1,500-page manifesto he wrote late last year: ‘I’ve now ordered 50ml – 99 per cent pure liquid nicotine from a Chinese online supplier.

‘3-4 drops will be injected in hollow point rifle bullets which will effectively turn it into a lethal chemical weapon.

‘I specifically instructed the Chinese supplier to send the package by courier to my company name, with extra wrapping and chemical labelling.’

According to scientists a fatal dose of pure nicotine is only one or two drops.

A police source in Oslo told the Daily Mail: ‘We still have to find out whether he did use the nicotine, and toxicology tests on the victims will give us the answer.

‘But his planning appears so meticulous 
that we fear he may have used the chemicals in this way. We would not 
put anything past this man.’  

Police sources have revealed that 
Breivik owned a number of weapons – including a pump action shotgun, 
bolt rifle and his favourite gun – the Ruger Mini 14.

Favourite: This Ruger Mini 14 was Breivik's weapon of choice, while he also owned guns including a pump action shotgun and bolt rifle

He wrote: ‘With sight equipment mounted on your assault rifle you will successfully manage to acquire and neutralise multiple targets in a minimum amount of time.’

Lethal: Dum-dum bullet are more deadly than normal ammunition as they leave a larger exit wound

The chief surgeon at a hospital treating victims of Norway's camp 
massacre said the killer used the special bullets designed to disintegrate 
inside the body and cause maximum internal damage.

Dr
Colin Poole, head of surgery at Ringriket Hospital in Honefoss north 
west of Oslo, said surgeons treating 16 gunshot victims have recovered 
no full bullets.

He said: 
'These bullets more or less exploded inside the body. These bullets 
inflicted internal damage that's absolutely horrible.'

Ballistics
experts say so-called dum-dum bullets also are lighter in weight and 
can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances.

They commonly are used by air marshals on aeroplanes and hunters of small animals.

Poole,
a surgeon for 26 years at the hospital, said the bullets were 
'hyper-fragmentable' and produced confusing pictures on X-rays.

'It's
caused us all kinds of extra problems in dealing with the wounds they 
cause, with very strange trajectories. The effect they cause inside the 
body is like a thousand pin pricks.'
