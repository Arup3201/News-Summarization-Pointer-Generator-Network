A Massachusetts Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a woman who had summoned the ride-sharing service.

Authorities say 46-year-old Alejandro Done was arraigned on Wednesday in Cambridge District Court. 

The Boston man pleaded not guilty to charges including rape and kidnapping.

Investigators say Done picked up the woman in Boston on December 6. She had summoned an Uber driver to take her to her Cambridge home.

The pick-up spot: 46-year-old Alejandro Done allegedly picked up a woman from Tremont Street (pictured) then allegedly drove her to a secluded area where he sexually assaulted her

Uber customers use a smartphone application to arrange and pay for rides with nearby drivers.

The driver allegedly told the woman that he would need a cash payment, so he took her to an ATM.

Authorities say he then drove her to a secluded location and sexually assaulted her. 

The Wicked Local reports that Done drove to a location that she was not familiar with then her pulled over in a secluded area and jumped in the backseat where she was sitting. 

He allegedly hit her and strangled her and locked the car doors so that she could not escape and covered her mouth so she could not scream. He then allegedly sexually assaulted the woman.

Uber says it's working closely with law enforcement to assist in the investigation.

'This alleged predator took advantage of a young woman who trusted that he was who he portrayed himself to be and exploited her vulnerability once he had her in his car,' said District Attorney Marian Ryan. 

'Every day people are engaging car services for their transportation needs, and placing their trust in them for their personal safety and security.

While these services are a convenience, and often a necessity of modern urban living, we urge everyone to take precautions to ensure they are as safe as possible,' said Ryan.

In hauntingly similar case's, three different women told Boston police that they were sexually assaulted over the weekend after getting into to cars they believed they ordered via ride sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft.

At least two of three women who police said were indecently assaulted Sunday while using ride-sharing services in Boston had ordered vehicles through Uber, according to authorities.

Police said on Monday night that all three incidents occurred early Sunday morning between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. in Dorchester, the Allston-Brighton area, and an unspecified location between Faneuil Hall and Dorchester. 

First incident: The first incident occurred just before 1 a.m. on Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately

The Boston Globe reports that the first incident occurred just before 1 a.m. on Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately.

She says she later got a text from her ride-share service saying her actual driver had arrived.

She ordered the car to stop and she ran out but police were not able to find the car she described being assaulted in.

At around 2:30 a.m. a second incident occurred when a woman called for a car to pick her up at 1030 commonwealth Avenue and take her home.

She got into a vehicle and was 'assaulted by an individual she believed to be employed by a rideshare service,' police said.

She was able to resist the driver's advances and get out of the car.

In a third incident in the same night a woman arranged for a ride from app from Faneuil Hall to Dorchester and 'fell asleep [during the trip] and woke to the driver indecently assaulting her,' police said.

Second incident: At around 2:30 a.m. a second incident occurred when a woman called for a car to pick her up at 1030 commonwealth Avenue and take her home and she was later 'sexually assaulted by the driver'

Police have not yet commented on whether or not the cases are connected.

Taylor Bennett, a spokesperson for the ride-sharing service Uber, sent a statement to CBS saying, 'no one should hail or get into any vehicle on the street that is not a clearly identifiable pre-arranged transportation provider or licensed taxi. There are strong reasons why doing so is unsafe, and therefore illegal, in the city of Boston.'

Meghan Joyce, who works as the general manager for Uber Boston, said the service has measures in place to guard against such incidents.

'Our technology has brought an unprecedented degree of accountability and transparency to the transportation industry — with driver and vehicle information provided in-app, detailed email receipts sent after each ride, a 24/7 feedback loop, and the ability to share your journey in real time,' the statement said. 

Third Incident: The same night a woman arranged for a ride from app from Faneuil Hall to Dorchester and 'fell asleep [during the trip] and woke to the driver indecently assaulting her,' police said
