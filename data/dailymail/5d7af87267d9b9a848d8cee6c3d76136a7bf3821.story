Abbey Clancy posted a picture of a rather tall, slim figure dressed in a skeleton costume on Friday morning with the message 'Guess who'. No prizes for working outit was Peter Crouch.

The model and presenter, who is married to the Stoke striker, showed her family are in the Halloween spirit by posting the snap to her 335,000 Twitter followers.

Crouch had a shock in midweek when he was sent off against Southampton on Wednesday for receiving two yellow cards in his side's midweek Capital One Cup clash.

The 6ft 7in 33-year-old will now miss his side's Premier League encounter against West Ham on Saturday.

Mark Hughes will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways on the weekend as the Potters have lost their last two games.

Crouch, who has scored three goals in 12 games so far this season, will be back in contention to face former side Tottenham on November 9 after serving a compulsory one-match ban.

Meanwhile, the Halloween fun continued as Liverpool defender Jose Enrique made team-mate Javier Manquillo dress up as Tweedledum (or is it Tweedledee?) from Alice in Wonderland.

The summer arrival from Atletico Madrid was forced into the punishment after losing to his Spanish pal on the computer game FIFA 15.

Enrique posted a video of Manquillo in fancy dress along with a taunting message, complete with a cheeky Spanish insult to finish: 'Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha. I don't know how many videos of this guy I have... Always lose at everything - at ping pong and FIFA. Thanks Manquillo for this times ata legoooo'
