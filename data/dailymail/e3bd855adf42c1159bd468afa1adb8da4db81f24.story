Stringent: The rules have been introduced after Jimmy Savile, pictured, abused children for decades

Celebrities and other public figures who use their fame to abuse children will face longer sentences under new rules published today.

Tougher sentences for future cases similar to those of Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall are a response to the public outcry over a string historic sex abuse cases dating back decades.

The move is part of wider toughening of sex offence sentencing guidelines designed to protect the public against dangerous rapists, paedophiles and online perverts.

Among the changes are:

Sentencing Council chairman Lord Justice Treacy said: 'No-one wants more people falling victim to offenders who come before the courts, and public protection is central to this guideline, whether this is by jailing offenders or, where appropriate, imposing a rigorous treatment order and other restrictions to prevent reoffending.'

The new guidelines for judges cover more than 50 sex offences including rape, child sex offences and trafficking.

Significantly, it will mean future cases similar to that of Hall - the disgraced It’s A Knockout presenter - or Savile, would be likely to result in longer jail sentences.

Sex attackers will no longer get a shorter sentence because of their claimed ‘good character’ if they used their public image and status to target victims.

Jailed: Former It's a Knockout presenter Stuart Hall, pictured, was also convicted of exploiting children

Other factors likely to lead to a longer sentence are the involvement of multiple people - a response to the sickening grooming gang cases in Rochdale and Oxford.

The guidelines also explicitly recognise for the first time the psychological damage caused by rape and other sex crimes, and the long term impact on victims.

On child pornography offences, anyone caught downloading even the lowest level of images will not ‘get off’ with a fine, although judges are also encouraged to use community sentences involving treatment than short jail terms.

Anyone distributing sick videos or making their own while abusing youngsters will also receive longer sentences.

Over the last five years a total of 59 paedophiles were fined for possession of child abuse images.

Earlier this year there was an outcry when a 13-year-old sex attack victim was described in court as ‘predatory’ - and her attacker got a suspended jail sentence.

The new guidelines make clear that children aged 13 or over no longer able to ‘consent’ to sex.

Longer terms will be doled out to gangs found guilty of grooming their victims. In Rochdale and Oxford young girls were abused by groups of men whom they regarded as their ‘boyfriends’ and whose plight was ignored by police and social services who regarded them as consenting.

The new rules also acknowledge the increasing use of technology by paedophiles online. Criminals who use codes to hide sex offending activity, who groom online and luring children into sharing explicit photos or videos can expect tougher penalties.

Children’s charities welcomed the changes, which come in to effect from April.

Barnardo’s deputy director of strategy Alison Worsley said: ‘The publication of this new sentencing guideline will help to ensure the focus is on the perpetrator and not the victim.

‘As the guideline emphasises, it is plain wrong to imply in any way that the experiences of sexually-exploited children are something they bring on themselves.’

Sue Berelowitz, deputy Children’s Commissioner for England said: ‘These far-reaching changes to the guidelines on sentencing for sexual offences by adults by the Sentencing Coucil rightly place the victims centre stage.

‘The new guidelines give an unequivocal message that society considers sex offences to be amongst the most serious and grave crimes that can be committed.

‘The impact, including long term consequences, for victims are frequently devastating. These guidelines make clear that such crimes are abhorrent and that sentences will properly reflect the gravity of the offence.’
