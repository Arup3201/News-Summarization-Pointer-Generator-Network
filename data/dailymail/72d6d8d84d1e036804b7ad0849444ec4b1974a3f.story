While we wait for Google to release its much-rumoured Babel translation device, the firm has bought an app that is a worthy substitute.

Word Lens uses augmented reality to translate text including road signs, menus, newspapers, and more by pointing a phone’s camera towards it.

Supported languages include Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese - and for a limited time, the app and $10 (£6) language packs are free.

Last month Microsoft unveiled its new Skype Translator technology, which it claims can decode languages in real time.

It means that during video calls, the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease.

Microsoft first unveiled the technology two years ago.

At the time, though, it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public.

But a recent breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition has reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent.

California-based developers Quest Visual announced the acquisition last month, but did not disclose how much the deal was worth.

The app is so popular is was recently showcased by Apple in one of its TV adverts.

'With Word Lens, we've seen the beginnings of what's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to 'see the world in your language,' the firm said said

'By joining Google, we can incorporate Quest Visual's technology into Google Translate's broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future.

'As a thank you to everybody who supported us on our journey, we've made both the app and the language packs free to download for a limited time while we transition to Google. 

The app is available on iOS, Android (pictured) and Google Glass. To use the translation tool, users select which languages they want to translate to and from before holding the camera up to the text. Once a language pack has been downloaded, the user doesn't need a network connection to use the app

'We're looking forward to continuing our work at Google - stay tuned!'

Word Lens automatically translates the text and overlays it on the same image on the phone's display.

Users can then take screenshots of the translated text for later use, for example.

Google already uses image recognition technology in its Goggles app, which can read text and translate it.

But in Quest Visual, the company is thought to have seen the potential for enhanced applications targeting language.
