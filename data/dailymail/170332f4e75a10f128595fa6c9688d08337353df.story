Inmate riots and a fire broke out at a prison when prisoners were told they were not allowed outside during hot weather.

Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire after the riot broke out at about 12.30pm yesterday.

The fire was reportedly started during the ongoing incident which kicked-off after the inmates refused to return to their cells.

A spokesman for the Prison Service said some damage was sustained but there were no injuries to staff or prisoners.

Glyn Travis, assistant secretary of the POA, described the disturbance as a 'serious incident' and said the prisoners refused to return to their cells before taking control of a unit.

Mr Travis added that the inmates started a fire which was quickly put under control. However, the disturbance continued until about 8pm last night.

Police, ambulance and fire crews attended the prison, which is on a country road a few miles outside Retford.

Officers carrying shields and other equipment were seen going inside, later joined by around 15 firefighters in their full kit.

Officers and police both arrived at the prison yesterday afternoon to help try and bring the riot under control

Although the fire was quickly brought under control by fire crews, the riot continued until about 8.10pm

Several prisoner-carrying vehicles went into the prison to collect a number of inmates, who could be heard shouting and banging as they were driven away.

It is thought specialist prison guards - similar to riot police – were deployed to the category C training prison and staff on weekend leave were called back to work to help with negotiations.

A prison spokesman said: 'A disturbance on one wing at HMP Ranby has ended. No 
staff or prisoners were injured and minimal damage was sustained.

'Prison staff were deployed to deal with the incident, which involved between 30 and 60 prisoners.

'The prison will now return to normal operation and visits will take place as usual.'

Nick Hardwick, chief inspector of prisons, said HMP Ranby was already ‘in crisis’ after the publication of a report on Thursday which described the prison as unsafe with high levels of violence.

The critical report of HMP Ranby was released following an 11-day inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons.

It found that two prisoners died through ‘self-inflicted deaths’ last year, and a further two have died in a similar way since the unannounced inspection in March.

Conditions in part of the prison, which holds more than 1,000 men, were dirty, prisoners were found to have climbed netting in a bid to force a transfer to another facility and nearly half the population said they had felt unsafe having been victimised or intimidated, findings showed.

Evidence was found of an increasing number of incidences of self-harm at the prison, and the availability of legal highs was also found to have increased.

Labour MP John Mann, whose Bassetlaw constituency includes the prison, said his repeated warnings that ‘dysfunctional' management and serious staff shortages would lead to disaster had been ignored by ministers and prison officials.

He said there were 80 fewer prison officers than previously - a 20% reduction - with many experienced individuals having been "forced out" over the past two years.

‘It is a prison where, for quite a time, it's been clear prisoners have been running the prison,’ he said.

‘There are not the numbers or the expertise among the staff to deal with it.

‘The governors were warned, the Government was warned, by me and by many others, that this would lead to disaster.

‘I have raised this directly with the prisons minister more than once.’

He welcomed the appointment of a new governor but said he had ‘lost track’ of how many changes there had been at the top and insisted the only solution was to recruit more staff.

Mr Travis said today's disturbance was ‘no surprise’ to the POA.

‘It's all down to chronic staff shortfalls and a management that are hell-bent on delivering things they can't deliver safely,’ he said.

‘Prisoners are saying 'We're not dealing with this'.

‘They will react.’
