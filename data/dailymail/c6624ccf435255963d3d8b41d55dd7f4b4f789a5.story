In one sense the World Cup is a new venture for me because I’m going to Brazil as part of the BBC team — and honoured to be doing so. 

I’ve spoken extensively to Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer about their TV roles and they say it’s obviously a different experience but probably the next best thing to playing.

I can assure you of one thing though: I’m not quite ready to join the Lineker-Shearer retirement club just yet. I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me.

Pundit: Rio Ferdinand will work for the BBC team at the World Cup this summer

Dream team: Ferdinand will work with the likes of Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer

It is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I’m in South America, I’ll make a decision about the next stage in my career, and when that happens I’ll tell you about it. But I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I’m intending to play on if the right situation arises. 

There is, in all honesty, nothing settled yet. Whatever I do next has to be right for me and my family and I’m going to take it one season at a time. I’m  keeping myself fit and in shape, doing my running and my workouts so I’ll be ready for whatever new club I join.

In Brazil, a country I’ve never visited before, I’m sure I’ll catch up with all sorts of former colleagues and opponents now covering the game.

But I also want to get out and about and explore, soak up the culture, try the food, hear the music, visit the favelas and get a proper look for myself at the other face of the carnival nation.

End of the road: Ferdinand left Manchester United this summer after 12 years at Old Trafford

Finishing touches: The build up to Brazil has been overshadowed by society problems and construction delays

Brazil has its well documented social problems and I want to learn about those for myself.

The poor seem to be getting poorer, and the rich richer. Thousands have been forcibly removed to make way for World Cup and Olympics projects. We need to educate ourselves on all this — and I intend to.

I’ll have expert guides part of the time in the shape of the  Da Silva twins, who live in mountains outside Rio. They’re going to cook me dinner and we’re going play volleyball on their court. I’m going to beat them, obviously; they play all the time but still can’t beat my touch.

The twins are expecting a crazy World Cup, crazy in a good sense, alive with noise and colour and home hopes. 

The further Brazil go, the  better the atmosphere will be, I’m sure.
