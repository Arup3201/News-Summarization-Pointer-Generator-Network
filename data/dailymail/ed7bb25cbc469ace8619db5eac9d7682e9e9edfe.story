Record breaker: British Adventurer Maria Leijerstam, 35, has become the first in the world to cycle 500 miles across the Antarctic to the South Pole

A British woman today became the first person to ever cycle 500 miles across Antarctica to the South Pole after beating two men to the finish line.

Adventurer Maria Leijerstam, 35, pedalled 500 miles across the icy wilderness of Antarctica to win her gruelling record attempt after four years of training.

She managed the bike ride to the South Pole in just 10 days - 12 days ahead of schedule despite 'vicious conditions' across the frozen continent.

Her three-wheel bicycle and daring route gave her the edge over her two male competitors, American Daniel Burton and Spaniard Juan Menendez Granados.

Ms Leijerstam, from the tiny village of Llantrithyd in the the Vale of Glamorgan, set off from the Novo Russian air force base on December 16.

It was so cold that at one point even the sweat on the inside of her boots froze.

For 10 days she heated her freeze-dried food by melting snow on a small stove inside her wind blasted tent.

Her team revealed how snow drifts, complete white outs and crevasses, marred her journey too.

But she still incredibly pedalled her way into the record books on a customised recumbent bike PolarCycle.

Her mother Adrianne said her daughter's success was due to 'meticulous planning, super fitness and pure determination'.

'From the time she was 12 years old and announced she wanted to be an astronaut, Maria has always been an adventurer,' she said. 'We are thrilled she has made it in such good time.'

Norwegian Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole in 1911 using two-metre long skis.

He was five weeks ahead of the tragic expedition party led by Briton Robert Falcon Scott.

New record: Ms Leijerstam managed the incredible feat in just 10 days - 12 days shorter than the 22 she believed it would take

Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later learned that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.

Ms Leijerstam chose a steeper but shorter route than her opponents - and even set off two days later.

She also has a vastly different bike from those of Burton and Menendez Granados.

While the men chose upright two-wheel machines, she went for a three-wheel recumbent cycle.

Her 45kg (100lbs) of food and equipment are stored over the extra wide rear driving wheels to add additional purchase in icy conditions - while the front wheels can be switched for skis to help negotiate snowdrifts.

Jumping for joy: Ms Leijerstam beat American Daniel Burton and Spaniard Juan Menendez Granados

No time to rest: Ms Leijerstam spent both Christmas Day and Boxing Day cycling across Antarctica

Ms Leijerstam cycled for up to 18 hours a day - only stopping for three-hour long power naps

Ms Leijerstam rode for up to 18 hours a day, followed by just two-to-three-hour power naps.

She was hoping to reach the South Pole by 7 January - but her team say it now may be much sooner and even within a couple of days if all goes well.

Before she left Ms Leijerstam said: 'The first five days will be tough but I am well prepared. My sole focus now is to cycle the whole way to the South Pole.'

Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition first conquered the South Pole in 1911 to beat Captain Scott.

Since then the journey has been completed with dog sleds, snowmobiles and four-wheel-drives - but never by bicycle.

Wrapped up warm: Ms Leijerstam faced incredibly harsh conditions during snow drifts, white outs and huge crevasses on her trip

Committed: Ms Leijerstam trained for three hours every day on top of her day job running and events and training company called Multisport Wales

For charity: Ms Leijerstam, pictured in Iceland while training, is raising money for Alzheimer's Socity research

She has decided to cycle in a recumbent position to make herself more aerodynamic against the extreme strong winds that blow from the Pole - and three wheels to increase stability in the snow.

Ms Leijerstam's intense training programme involved three hours a day of training on top of her day job running Multisport Wales, an events and training company.

It even saw her endured a whole day cycling in an industrial freezer in Portsmouth at minus 20 degrees - while surprised factory workers stacked shelves around her.

She has also cycled across a frozen lake in eastern Siberia early in 2012 and go on training trips to Norway and Iceland to test kit and equipment on glaciers and mountain ranges.

Big achievement: Ms Leijerstam, pictured while training in Iceland, beat two male competitors to the finish line

Preparation: Ms Leijerstam had to make sure she was in peak physical condition for the bike ride in temperatures as low as  minus 40 degrees

Well planned: Ms Leijerstam tested out other bicycles before opting for her three-wheel recumbent cycle
