Accused: Indiana teenager Cody Burns, pictured, is accused of stabbing his father in the chest because he told him to pull up his pants

An Indiana teenager is accused of stabbing his father in the chest because he told him to pull up his pants.

Cody Burns, from New Albany, faces a charge of battery by means of a deadly weapon after the Tuesday incident.

According to a probably cause affidavit, Burns became enraged after his father, who hasn't been named, suggested he pull up his pants, which he was presumably wearing low in a fashion that revealed his underpants.

The 18-year-old then walked into the kitchen and returned to the living room with a knife in his hand, police said.

According to his father, Burns came at him and stabbed him in the left side of his chest.

When officers arrived, they noticed blood on the floor where the victim was sitting.

The injuries to the victim were not life threatening.

He was taken to a local hospital but is recovering.

Another person at the home witnessed the alleged stabbing and supported the victim's statement, according to the affidavit.
