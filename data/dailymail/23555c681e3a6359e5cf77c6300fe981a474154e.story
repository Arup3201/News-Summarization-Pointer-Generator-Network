Christmas has come and gone but one Starbucks in Connecticut is still very much in the holiday spirit.

Customers at the location off the Berlin turnpike in Newington have been continuously paying for the person behind them in line since Christmas Eve.

As of 10am Friday, the manager at the location told MailOnline that 900 customers in a row have paid for the customer behind them in line. By Friday afternoon, that number had grown to 1000 - which means they may have already set a new world record.

Paying it forward: Since Christmas Eve, 900 customers at this Starbucks location in Newington, Connecticut have been paying for the order behind them in line

While this Starbucks location has noticed small streaks of generosity before, the number of customers usually simmers out at about 25.

But when one customer paid for the person behind them in line out of the blue Tuesday morning, the pay-it-forward scheme took off and hasn't stopped yet.

According to Consumerist, the last time something similar happened was last year at a Tim Hortons drive-thru in Canada,  but that frenzy only involved 228 orders over three hours.

Generosity over cups of Joe: As of Friday morning, 900 customers in a row had continued the act of kindness with some people paying for orders as much as $20

Workers at the Starbucks in Newington say they are surprised it has continued to go on for so long, and that people with modest orders are paying for the $20 dollar round of coffees behind them.

'I think it's awesome,' shift supervisor Nicole told ABC News. 'I love this company so much and I'm so proud to work for them. This is what our company embodies. We're all really excited about it.'

Customers are just as excited about the unexpected treat, which explains why the simple act of kindness has continued its momentum.

'It feels so good,' customer Cathy Shemeth told NBC Connecticut. 'It's awesome. That's what Christmas is all about.'
