A fake groom has been jailed for a year after a suspicious registrar tipped off police when he used an iPhone translation app to talk to his Eastern European bride-to-be.

Avtar Singh, 38, registered a notice of intention to marry a Czech woman - but the registrar became suspicious when he took out his phone and accessed the app to communicate with his ‘fiancée’.

Two weeks later Singh, who is Indian, married the woman but the registrar called police after noticing the bride’s dress was dirty and that the couple were giving a ‘choreographed performance’.

Police discovered Singh, who was living in Wolverhampton, paid thousands of pounds to a crime gang who supplied Eastern European women to men from countries outside the European Union.

Officers discovered the gang had organised a string of sham weddings in Shrewsbury and Manchester between 2012 and 2013.

Another man, Elohor Eruotor, 34, was found to have married Czech-born Angela Balogova, 32, at the Scottish village of Gretna Green, which is famous for hosting runaway weddings.

Officers discovered Balogova was one of four Eastern European women who were paid to marry men from abroad who were desperate to stay in Britain.

Singh and Eruotor, a Nigerian man who was also living in Wolverhampton, were arrested last March and both admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law.

They were each jailed for 12 months when they appeared at Manchester Crown Court last Friday.

Registrar Paul Ainscough, who alerted police to Singh’s sham wedding, told the court the wedding was a ‘choreographed performance’.

He added: ‘The hem of the bride’s dress was soiled and she wore it without any deportment or sense of occasion.’

Members of the gang, mostly from Manchester, who arranged the fake marriages were jailed for between 16 months and five years.

The court heard Singh and Eruotor aimed to get permission to stay, work and claim benefits by abusing rules that allow immigrants to remain in the UK if they are married to EU nationals living in the country.
