A Canadian railway is suing the mother of man killed by one of its trains – giving the heartbroken woman until exactly two years to the day of the accident to answer the suit.Sharon Jobson, of Glencoe, Ontario, has until July 29 to answer a $500,000 lawsuit from CN Rail brought against the grieving mother for damages and train delays incurred through her 22-year-old son John Jobson’s negligence despite the crossing still not having adequate signage and warnings, according to reports.‘We thought we had a happy ending. Lights and gates are going up in the next two weeks — they’ve already been delivered . . .  I think everyone thought it was a good ending to a tragic story. This is just really a shock to everyone,’ Sharon Jobson told the Toronto Star.

Dead: John Jobson, 22, died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train, now the railroad is suing his mother for damages

Despite Sharon Jobson, 50, persuading the rail operator to budget over $400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings, the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates, yet the CN Rail felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate, according to CTV.John Jobson is ‘wholly responsible’ for costs related to rail repair and a ‘bottleneck of rail traffic,’ according to a copy of the suit obtained by the Toronto Star. The suit goes on to say that Jobson failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling ‘at an excessive rate of speed’ over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train, the paper reported. John Jobson died six days later at a local hospital.

‘He created a situation of danger . . . (and) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing,’ the paper reported the suit said.Of the 116 passengers on-board the VIA train, six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision, according to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

Pay up: CN Rail says negligence caused the collision and that the $500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother Sharon Jobson

Unsafe: The suit was brought against Sharon Jobson despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded

The history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which John Jobson had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a Canadian Pacific Railway train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred, according to the TSB report. Adequate signage and warnings were installed at the CP crossing shortly after the incident, the TSB report noted.Despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where John Jobson’s pickup truck was hit, CN Rail neglected to upgrade the crossing’s warning systems, which the TSB said were ‘situated too low,’ to sufficiently warn drivers.Also a hindrance to John Jobson being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn’s position – instead of being at the front of the locomotive, it was in the middle of the head car, making it harder to hear, according to the TSB report.

Crushed: Sharon Jobson's son is dead because a train hit him, and now the railway wants her to pony up $400,000

The devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad, saying it was never about the money.‘We were happy with getting some safety measures in place. We never were seeking anything financial,’ she told the Star, adding ‘I was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that won’t be happening too soon.’Both the railway and Sharon Jobson are declining to comment publicly on the suit, with Sharon Jobson only telling CTV ‘I don’t want to be doing this at this time.I just want to have a peaceful time.'
