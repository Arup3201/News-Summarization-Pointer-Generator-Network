The family of a young mother who died in suspicious circumstances say they know the killer and want justice.

Maddison Murphy-West, 20, was found dead in her Melbourne home last October when police launched a homicide investigation. 

They suspect the crime scene in Pakenham had been tampered with so it would appear Maddy had committed suicide.

Murdered: Police officers originally believed that Maddison Murphy-West had committed suicide but later discovered she had been killed

Relatives say the key clue to busting the case and nabbing the murderer is a $1,500 Christmas hamper for which Maddison had saved hard - following her death it was redirected to the 'murderer's' family, they claim.

They also say money was withdrawn from her account after her death and that the person they believe has information about her death was seen selling drugs on the actual day Maddison died.

The family are outraged that social media has been used to shift blame onto an innocent man and also say Maddy's car has disappeared.

They are begging for those who have information to come forward and demand justice, at the very least, for Maddison's  adored 23-month-old son, Noah, who was in the home, in the out-lying Melbourne suburb, when Maddison was found dead. 

'I want whoever did this to be punished,' Maddison's mother Paula Murphy told the Herald Sun. 'It's hard to describe. It's the worst place you could possibly be. All you do is get up every day and hope it's a dream.'

Ms Murphy, said she had feared for some time for her daughter's safety. She said that in 2012 she had noticed marks on Maddison's neck where someone had tried to choke her.

'She would just say it was play-fighting. That she bruised easily,' Ms Murphy said.

Maddison's uncle, Shannon, said that on another occasion he saw his niece with bruises on her upper body and wanted to do something about it, but she talked him out of it.

'I said, "why don't you bring him around here and we'll do something about it,"' he said. 'There are people out there who definitely know what happened. They need to come forward and tell the truth for Maddy.'

Ms Murphy said she knew as soon as police arrived at the door on October 23 that Maddison was dead. 'I said, "What's he done to her? What's he done to her?"' she said.

Mother and daughter were close and had met the day before Maddison was found dead. 'She said, "I love you". We said we loved each other every time we saw each other,' Ms Murphy recalled. 'She said, "I'll see you tomorrow."'

Maddison's grandfather, Gil, said he had been changed by her death, and was even having dreams about killing the man he believes is responsible, or having him bashed.

'I'm not that sort of person,' Mr Murphy said. 'It's frightened me. We're the good people. They're the bad people. That's why we don't do that sort of stuff.'

Those closest to the cheerful 'go-getter' said they immediately knew Maddy hadn't taken her own life. 'We all knew, the night we were told, it wasn't suicide,' friend Alicia Hill said.

Another friend, Meaghan Vander Ree, described Maddison as an amazing mother and said Ms Murphy-West had lived with her boyfriend and their son in the Ahern Road home for three years.

'She always put her son first. If he looks over this when he's older, we want him to realise how amazing she was,' Ms Vander Ree said.
