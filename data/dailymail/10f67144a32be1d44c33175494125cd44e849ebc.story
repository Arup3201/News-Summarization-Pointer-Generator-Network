Speaking out: Sara Leal, pictured partying during a promotions trip to Las Vegas earlier this year, has revealed all the seedy details about her alleged one night stand with Ashton Kutcher last month

The partygirl who allegedly bedded Ashton Kutcher on the eve of his sixth wedding anniversary to Demi Moore has spoken out for the first time.

Sara Leal, 22, gave a candid interview where she revealed all the tawdry details about the seedy night at the Hard Rock hotel in San Diego, California, last month.

The Texas-born model claims the Two And A Half Men star wanted to have a threesome with her and her best friend Marta Borzuchowski - but in the end settled for a two-hour romp with her.

She also says that Ashton told her he was separated from wife Demi when she asked him if he was married.

Speaking to The Sun newspaper, Sara described how she had sex twice with the 33-year-old actor.

She said: 'We had sex twice. 
Everything felt natural. We were having a good time. He was good, but it
wasn't weird or perverted or creepy.

'He had good endurance. We were up for a while. It was about two hours.'

In an interview with Us Weekly she added that they had unprotected sex saying Kutcher didn't use a condom during their encounter.

Leal described how earlier in the night he had kissed her and her friend Marta on the bed of his hotel room.

'I'm sure he wanted to have a threesome,' she said. 'It was clear he wasn't opposed to it.'

Sara said there were around 20 revellers partying with Kutcher in his lavish suite, drinking vodka, tequila and beer.

Most of the guests left at around 5am, leaving Kutcher with Sara and some of her girlfriends.

Leal claims they then all jumped in the hot tub naked, saying: 'Ashton looked hot naked.'

Patching things up? Ashton spent the weekend with wife Demi Moore at a camp ground in Cachuma Lake, Santa Barbara

When one of Sara's friends asked if Kutcher was married, Leal claims he replied: 'I am separated'.

After
the hot tub session, Sara and friend Marta ended up in Kutcher's bed - 
but Marta left after a short while leaving Kutcher alone with Sara.

'The last thing I remember him saying was he did a good job. We woke up and I wearing a robe.

'He opened it up and I was like "What are you doing?" He was like, "Just checking. Ok, I did good. You're really pretty.'"

Split rumours: Kutcher's infidelity allegedly happened on the morning of his sixth wedding anniversary in September

Ashton's wife Demi was in New York on the night of the alleged one night stand.

Over the weekend, Kutcher was pictured apparently trying to patch things up with Demi, 48, the Cachuma Lake camp ground near Santa Barbara, accompanied by the couple's Kabbalah instructor Yehuda Berg and Kutcher's friend Eric Buterbaugh.

It was the first time the duo have been seen together in three months, and 
since news broke that Kutcher had a alcohol-fuelled hot tub party awash 
with women.

The pair are being counselled by members of the faith, which is a controversial offshoot of Judaism.

Ashton,
a Kabbalah devotee,  is said by Radar Online to have apologised for his
behaviour to his wife on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.

He
allegedly asked for the chance to make amends for cheating on Moore 
with Leal on the morning of their sixth 
anniversary.

Just two days before their campfire summit, they attended a Kabbalah service in Los Angeles together.

Though
they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Kutcher greeted his wife with a
hug after the service, and they reportedly walked out with their arms 
round each other.

They have 
also been spotted wearing their wedding rings, despite a 'top source' 
close to the pair insisting that their relationship is 'dead' and that they are headed for divorce.

Scene of the 'crime': Kutcher is said to have cavorted naked with Leal in the hot tub of the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego before bedding him

Today Kutcher tried to keep a low profile as he returned to the set of Two And A Half Men in Los Angeles.

The
actor, who replaced Charlie Sheen in the hit show, dipped his head down
and held his hand over his baseball cap as he stopped at a Studio City 
gas station en route to shoot the sitcom.

The actor looked a little scruffy in 
baggy jeans, grey cardigan and blue and white checked shirt as he filled
his car with petrol.
