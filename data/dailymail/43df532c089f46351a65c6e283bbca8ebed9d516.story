Rather than apologizing for his drunken rant in a viral video in which he declared his father owned 'half of Manhattan,' NYU student Gerry Shalam has decided to go on the offensive by threatening to sue the people who embarrassed him.

The New York Post reports that legal action was hinted in a statement from attorney Darren Oved.

'This is a 
shameful exploitation of a young man who was clearly protecting himself 
and his friends from unwanted intrusions into their private lives at a 
vulnerable moment,' Oved states.

NYU student Gerry Shalam, 20, wants to sue the people who posted a video of his drunken rant that left him the talk of the internet

'Our client takes this blatant violation of his civil 
rights seriously and intends to take all appropriate measures to ensure 
that this video’s publishers and all those who have and continue to 
disseminate it are held legally accountable.'

Shalam,
 20, provides plenty of laughs in the short video clip in which he 
attempts to intimidate the person filming him with some rather grandiose
 - and seriously ill-judged – boasts.

‘This
 your property? My dad is in f**kin’ real estate, you’re gonna tell me 
this your property? My dad owns half of f**king Manhattan,’ the student 
from Allenhurst, New Jersey screams at the cameraman.

The footage starts with Shalam and his equally well-oiled friends causing a nuisance outside a dry cleaners on 28th Street in Manhattan.

A blonde girl attempts to help a man in a blue shirt stand up straight, while Shalam takes issues with the man filming them.

The man with the camera explains that his is unhappy about them loitering on his property and so Shalam attempts to one up him by claiming that his father is in real estate and 'owns half of f**king Manhattan.'

When asked his name, Shalam responds 'Gerry Adjmi,' adding later that 'I’m a f**king lawyer.'

Shalam apparently used the phony surname because his drunken friend - who by this point is on the pavement - is himself an Adjmi, a wealthy New York real estate family who don’t own half of Manhattan either.

Eventually the drunken students depart the scene, but not before Shalam utters another classic lines: 'You think I don't own the cops?' and ‘Do you want me to call [New York City Mayor] Bill de Blasio on you right now?’

Since waking up with a hangover and realizing his embarrassing exploits are all other the internet, Shalam has done his best to disappear by deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts.

Unfortunately for Gerry, he wasn’t able to delete everything about him online and The Smoking Gun has reported that surprise, surprise, Gary wasn’t being totally honest with his idle boasts.

His father isn’t a property magnate, but rather Lou Shalam is a garment industry executive, while his mother Frieda is an event coordinator and member of the Allenhurst Borough zoning and planning board.

Perhaps deservedly Shalam is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ‘over-privileged’ and ‘an insufferable rich-kid.’

But it appears this member of NYU’s Class of 2017 isn’t all bad and his accomplishments include co-founding a charitable organization called Brothers Helping Others that helps low-income immigrant families in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

If this latest incident wasn’t embarrassing enough for Salam, it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a former thespian.

At age 13, he played the Scarecrow in a community center production of Hip Hop Wiz, a Wizard of Oz adaptation produced by his mother.

The musical included 'unbelievable hip hop dance routines' and a script that 'was recreated with a Syrian twist,' according to a YouTube clip.
