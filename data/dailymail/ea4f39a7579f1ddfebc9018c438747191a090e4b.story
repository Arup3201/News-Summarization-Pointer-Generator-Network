Asda has been named as the best-value supermarket for buying Christmas dinner - with shoppers saving nearly £30 compared to other brands.

The prices of 33 festive items - including turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies and Champagne - were analysed across the five major stores, with Asda coming in at number one at £119.96 for the total shop.

Tesco scooped second place at £129.40; Morrisons was third at £135.71; Sainbury’s came in at four place with a festive basket costing £139.05.

Asda's Christmas basket was the cheapest, research by trade magazine The Grocer found

In fifth place, and the most expensive, was Waitrose at £149.54, which is £29.58 dearer when compared to festive shopping at Asda.

The annual mystery shop was carried out by trade magazine The Grocer, which compared prices of 33 must-have items for Christmas.

It found that Tesco has the cheapest bacon (£2,22); Asda is best for brandy butter (£1.50); Champagne is best-priced in Morrisons (£16.99); and Christmas pudding costs £1.89 in Asda - compared to the most expensive £3.75 at Waitrose.

Quality Street chocolates are £2 in Asda and Tesco; £2.06 in Waitrose and £3 in Morrisons and Sainsbury's.

And, when it comes to the all-important turkey, Sainsbury's is the cheapest at £10.16, followed by Asda (£10.40); Tesco and Morrisons (£12.00) and Waitrose (£15.00).

This year's prices were compared with 2013's to find out what shoppers will pay as falling commodity prices and deflation take their toll. 

It found that the baskets at the top five supermarkets were all cheaper this year, with price cuts deepest at Sainsbury's.

But the trade magazine said the number of comparable products varies from retailer to retailer making like-for-like comparisons impossible. 

In terms of products, the biggest fall was on carrots which were down 40 per cent on average as a result of heavy discounting and a much better harvest.

However, many prices are at the same level as last year.

The price of the frozen turkey is unchanged in most supermarkets and is up 20 per cent at Morrisons.

Asda president and chief executive Andy Clarke said: 'We are delighted the 2014 Grocer 33 Christmas basket confirms what our customers already know - at Asda, the premium is in our products not our prices.

'Despite tempting gimmicks, at a time when budgets are stretched, they can be assured their big Christmas shop will cost less at Asda.'

The supermarket offered the cheapest prices on two thirds of the products on the list.

The biggest high street supermarket chains are offering Britain's shoppers a very merry Christmas this year - with many major drinks brands cheaper than they were a year ago, research has found.

Some of the deepest cuts are in the lager market where, on average, multi-packs of the top-five brands are 4.9 per cent cheaper this week than last December, with Stella Artois and Budweiser down 4.5 per cent and Carlsberg down 5.1per cent.

The Grocer says that price drops have been driven by the largest formats with packs containing more than 15 cans or bottles down as much as 11 per cent.

Cuts have also been seen in the cider category with the average price of the five biggest cider brands down 4.6 per cent a litre.

The study also revealed that wine prices are down 2.1 per cent across supermarkets but Champagne has risen by 2.1per cent a litre, while sparkling white is up 1.9 per cent overall.
