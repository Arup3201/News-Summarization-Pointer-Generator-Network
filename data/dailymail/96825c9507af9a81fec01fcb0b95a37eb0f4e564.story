The family of a man who was left dying whilst he sat in the waiting room of the ER to be seen, have spoken of their distress when they learned the details of his death.

John Verrier's family first heard the terrible news after seeing the story on a local TV news broadcast.

'Deep down inside I knew it was him,' said Charles Verrier to ABC7.

John Verrier went to the hospital for a rash and was discovered dead in the waiting room 8 hours later

Susan Verrier: No one should sit in the waiting room that long. I'm sorry, name calling over the loud speaker proves nothing, nothing

Charles Verrier, brother: I don't know how, I don't know why. I don't want this pushed under the rug as another mistake

The family says they knew that John 
Verrier died at St Barnabas Hospital, but claim they had no idea the 
story of a 30-year-old man who had been kept waiting eight hours was 
their brother, and son.

'You're
 just a number no matter where you go. That's how they treated him like a
 number,' said Charles, tears flowing down his cheeks.

An ER Worker said Mr Verrier was found sitting in his chair. 'They found this person, slumped over cold blue and stiff..he was dead.'

Incomprehensible: The family are grief stricken but more than anything, they want answers

The
 emergency room worker who was on duty at the time believes the 30 
year-old man may have been dead for several hours before being 
discovered by a security guard.

'There's
 no policy in place to check the waiting room to see if people waiting 
to be seen are still there or still alive,' said the ER worker.

John
 Verrier had struggled with drug addiction and had been to St Barnabas 
before but his family says he had been clean for months and living at 
home.

He had gone to the ER complaining about a rash, his vitals were checked and he was told to wait until his name was called.

He sat in a hospital waiting room teeming with 
other sick people.

He entered the waiting room at 10pm. By 6:04am the following morning, he was dead, found slumped over in a waiting room chair:

A spokesperson from the hospital 
claims that Verrier was checked on several times but that he seemed to 
be in a decent condition. The hospital said, 'Per our policy and 
procedures, security checked on the patient and others. video 
surveillance confirms that he was still active and moving around as late
 as 3:45am. An internal review, the spokesman says has concluded that 
all hospital guidelines were met.'

Chris Verrier: I don't know how, I don't know why. I don't want this pushed under the rug as another mistake

One ER worker at St.Barnabas hospital in the Bronx thinks a man died because the hospital is severely understaffed

John's brother was horrified at the news of his tragic passing

An ER worker toldÂ  ABC news that it simply wasn't true.

'He
 was not checked on that is 100-percent false, was his name called? Yes,
 it was 3 times over the P-A system.' He adds, 'Based on number of 
people in the waiting room it is impossible to check on each person 
physically.'

'For me it feels like a cover-up,'continued the worker.

The
 ER employee said that he believes if a hospital doesn't assume 
responsibility for its mistakes then mistakes are likely to happen 
again.

'In healthcare, I understand it's a business but if people are dying under your watch, something has to be done,' he said.

A worker from St.Barnabas Hospital says 
that he was cold, blue, and stiff and says that he may have been dead 
for several hours.

The quest for answers: John Verrier had struggled with drug addiction and had been to St Barnabas before but his family says he had been clean for months and living at home

The hospital claims that they checked on John Verrier 'several times' before he was discovered dead

John's brother Chris was horrified when he heard about the incident and shared a few words on his brothers behalf.

'Just
 got some really bad news that it was my brother who was the one who 
passed away at st barnabas hospital er waiting room. How is that 
possible. How how I ask,' he wrote on his Facebook.

'No one 
should sit in the waiting room that long. I'm sorry, name calling over 
the loud speaker proves nothing, nothing,' said Susan Verrier, the 
John's mother.

The hospital says they called his name several names over the intercom and checked on him.

A
 spokesman says video surveillance shows he was active and moving three 
hours before security found him and all hospital guidelines were met.

The family are grief stricken but more than anything, they want answers.

'I don't know how, I don't know why. I don't want this pushed under the rug as another mistake,' adds Chris.

The
 medical examiner has yet to determine a cause of death. The New York 
State Department of Health is investigating the incident.
