Ryan Mason probably didn't expect his tattoo to take centre stage during his senior England debut, but that's exactly what happened on Tuesday night.

The 23-year-old was celebrating Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Andros Townsend's equalising goal for England against Italy when a tattoo on his arm was shown across televisions worldwide.

Twitter user @Danorako compared it to a photograph of himself at 12 years old, and has since been retweeted more than 20,000 times by those noticing the uncanny resemblance.

Other than that it was a relatively successful debut for the starlet. England escaped Turin with a 1-1 draw and Mason was given 16 minutes by Roy Hodgson as he replaced Jordan Henderson.

Four years ago on Thursday he played just six minutes in a 1-0 defeat by Bristol City in the ChampionshipÂ during a loan spell with Doncaster Rovers.

Mason was farmed out to Swindon Town in League One  last season again, but has followed Harry Kane by making a remarkable rise to the Barclays Premier League and international football.
