A jilted lover who stabbed his ex-girlfriend six times in the stomach while she was heavily pregnant has been jailed today for 15 years.

Andre Smith, 25, attacked Rachel Kane, also 25, at her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, with such ferocity that he broke two knives during the assault.

Ms Kane, who was seven months pregnant, suffered lacerations to her uterus and liver and a perforated bowel during the attack.

She was taken into intensive care where she went into labour, despite efforts by doctors to halt the premature birth.

Not only did Ms Kane survive the assault but she also gave birth to a healthy daughter, who was born three months early.

Worcester Crown Court heard Smith went to Ms Kane’s home at around 11pm on July 28, armed with a plasterer’s knife.

He forced his way in and attacked her in front of her other child in the hall before dragging her into the kitchen where he stabbed her with a second knife.

Smith fled the scene but was arrested in nearby Hagley a short time later after phoning the police to turn himself in.

The court heard Smith, from Great Barr, Birmingham, had targeted Ms Kane four years after the pair split up.

At the time of the attack, she had been on the phone to her new partner - who dialled 999 after he heard her screams.

Judge Robert Juckes jailed Smith for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to attempted murder.

He ordered Smith to serve at least ten years before he is considered for parole.

A second charge of attempted child destruction was ordered to lie on file.

Speaking after the verdict, DI David Williams of West Mercia Police welcomed the sentence and branded Smith ‘dangerous’.

He said: 'Smith is clearly a very dangerous individual who attacked his former partner with the clear intention to kill the unborn child she was having with a new partner.

'The majority of stab wounds were to her abdomen and it is only the swift reaction of neighbours and her partner, and the prompt medical attention she received, that saved her life and that of her baby.

'Although the child was born a week later and was very premature, it has thankfully pulled through.

'This was a horrific case but the police officers on duty that night and in the following days displayed excellent teamwork and dedication in carrying out a speedy arrest and gathering enough evidence to ensure Smith could be kept in custody.

'The lengthy jail sentence handed down by the court reflects severity of the attack and we hope it brings some comfort to the victim and her family.'
