A woman discovered two children near a daycare center's dumpster on Tuesday - and their father was nowhere to be found.

Veena Iyer told Boca Raton officers she saw the boy, 1, and girl, 4, walking around Tuesday afternoon before she contacted authorities, according to an affidavit obtained by MailOnline.

'It should be noted this area is next to a public roadway,' the affidavit said.

Iyer told police the children took her to their family's home - but their parents were not there.

'They were in their pajamas, no shoes, nothing, seemed very tired and hungry,' Iyer told WPBF, who earlier reported on the case. 'I said, "Who is watching you?" and [the girl] said, "Nobody." I asked her, 'Where is your dad?' She said, "I don’t know. He took my mom to work."'

Father Stanley Fitzpatrick, 41,  was eventually found by Boca Raton police officers and told them he took his wife to a bus stop before he stopped to talk with a friend, according to the affidavit.

The children's mother told a WPBF crew of the situation 'It's not really that serious. 'The cameraman [is] supposed to come out if the child drowns, if the child was severe hurt. They were not hurt. They did not drown.'

The affidavit revealed the family's home was in 'substandard conditions.'

'[Officers] observed moldy food in the refrigerator, the dishwasher left open with dishes and knives in it, and there were no locks on the cabinets,' it said.

Officers also reportedly only found 4 diapers in the home and discovered the children slept on a mattress together on the floor.

It also alleged that the 1-year-old boy 'had such bad diaper rash that he was flinching when officers changed his diaper.'

Fitzpatrick was arrested on two counts of child neglect, police said.

The Palm Beach Post reported he posted a $6,000 bond.
