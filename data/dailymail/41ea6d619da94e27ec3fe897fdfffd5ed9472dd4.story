Have you noticed that most ear buds never fit snugly?

One of the biggest offenders is Apple’s standard EarPods,
which despite unveiling a new and improved design last year, are famously
uncomfortable to wear.

Tired of constantly readjusting their EarPods, designers at
Canadian group OHM decided to engineer a solution.

What they came up with is a relatively simple device named Sprngclip
that helps Apple’s EarPods to stay put.

Users snap or slide each ear bud into a Sprng clip. They then insert and adjust each clip to make them fit

‘As active folks, we noticed that our Apple EarPods continually
fell out while we were on the move,’ said the company.

‘With some research, we realised that it wasn't our ears. We
also didn't like the idea of having to buy a whole new set of earbuds designed
to stay in our ears when we were active.

‘Simply supplementing the existing earbuds seemed like a
less wasteful solution so we began working on a small, simple fix to the
problem.’

The Sprng clips will only fit the standard Apple buds supplied
with iPhone 5, iPod Nano, iPod Touch devices.

They come in white and light grey and cost $10 (£6.47).

The headphones Apple released with the early versions of its
iPhones and iPods didn't fit in the ear properly and were renowned for
'leaking' music.

In September 2012, Apple released its EarPods which were
first shipped with the iPhone 5.

They were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to
reduce noise leakage.

However, customers complained that they were uncomfortable
and still didn't fit properly.

In a promotional video featuring Apple designer Jonathan
Ive, described the EarPods as ‘a breakthrough for ears everywhere.’

‘Making one headphone to fit everybody's ears would be like
trying to make one pair of shoes to fit everybody's feet — I mean it's
impossible,’ he said.

Last month, Apple filed a patent for a pair of headphones
that automatically adjust the volume of music if they're not inserted far
enough into the ear.
