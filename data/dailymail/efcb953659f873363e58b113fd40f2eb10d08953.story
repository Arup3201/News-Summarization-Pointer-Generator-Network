Microsoft has officially named cloud-computing executive Satya Nadella as its new CEO.

Nadella, who has spent 22 years at the firm and was previously in charge of the tech giant's cloud software and services division, will replace exiting CEO Steve Ballmer. 

The appointment spells the end of an exhaustive five-month search following Ballmer's resignation in August.

Nadella is a native of Hyderabad, India - where Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research centre.

Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems.

He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams.

He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011. 

For the past seven months, he was the 
executive vice president who led Microsoft's cloud computing offerings -
 a new area for Microsoft, which has traditionally focused on software 
installed on personal computers rather than on remote servers connected 
to the internet.

Nadella's group has been growing strongly, although it 
remains a small part of Microsoft's current business.

Experts say the move will signal a 
focus on business users rather than consumers for the firm, which has 
faced aggressive competition from Apple and Google for its software.

Elsewhere, company founder Bill Gates is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser, and board member John Thompson will take his place.

Nadella is only the third leader in the software giant's 38-year history, after Gates and Ballmer.

Nadella, who is 46 and has worked at Microsoft for 22 years, has been an executive in some of the company's fastest-growing and most profitable businesses, including its Office and server and tools business.

For the past seven months, he was the executive vice president who led Microsoft's cloud computing offerings - a new area for Microsoft, which has traditionally focused on software installed on personal computers rather than on remote servers connected to the internet.

'Satya is a proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together,' Gates said in a statement.

'His vision for how technology will be used and experienced around the world is exactly what Microsoft needs as the company enters its next chapter of expanded product innovation and growth.'

The company said that Gates, in his new role as founder and technology advisor, 'will devote more time to the company, supporting Nadella in shaping technology and product direction.'

Company founder Bill Gates, pictured, also announced he is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser, and board member John Thompson will take his place. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change

The appointment of Nadella makes him 
the most powerful Indian-born tech executive in the world and put him 
alongside PepsiCo Inc's chief, Indra Nooyi, as the leader of a 
well-known, large-cap U.S. corporation.

Nadella's appointment comes at a time of turmoil for Microsoft.

Founded
 in April 1975 by Gates and Paul Allen, the company has always made 
software that powered computers made by others - first with its MS-DOS 
system, then with Windows and its Office productivity suite starting in 
the late 1980s.

But Microsoft has been late 
adapting to developments in the technology industry.

It allowed Google 
to dominate in online search and advertising, and it watched as iPhones,
 iPads and Android devices grew to siphon sales from the company's 
strengths in personal computers.

Its attempt to manufacture its own 
devices has been littered with problems, from its quickly aborted Kin 
line of phones to its still-unprofitable line of Surface tablets.

Analysts see hope in some of the businesses Nadella had a key role in creating.  

Microsoft shares rose 32 cents to $36.80 (Â£22.58) in morning trading.

Born
 in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech 
career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems.

He joined 
Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading 
roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams.

He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011.

That
 unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, 
which Nadella runs under his official title of executive vice president,
 cloud and enterprise.

Some
 investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely 
to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends 
and share buybacks, but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would be 
unpopular with Wall Street.

There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor-friendly moves.

Several people briefed on the CEO search process had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of candidates, including Nadella and Tony Bates, executive vice-president of business development, plus at least one external candidate.

Analysts hope Nadella can maintain the company's momentum in the rapidly expanding field of cloud computing while minimizing the negative impact from Microsoft's unprofitable forays into consumer hardware.
