Ched Evans continues to divide Sheffield United fans over whether the club should re-sign the striker, who was convicted of raping a 19-year-old in 2011, following his release from jail this week.

Fans chanted loudly in support of the 25-year-old, who continues to profess his innocence, as Sheffield United beat Bradford City 2-0 at Valley Parade in their first game since Evans was released from Wymott Prison, near Preston.

But TV presenter and women’s rights campaigner Charlie Webster urged the club not to re-sign Evans, stating that she would quit her role as a Sheffield United patron if he was given his job back.

‘This is my club that I was brought up in, watching games at the stadium since I was four years old,’ said Webster.

‘I also worked at the club as a patron for the foundation, which is about integrity and respect.

‘My club is about community. It has much more power than just football.

‘It influences the next generation and I don’t believe it is sending out the right message to employ a convicted rapist.

‘I won’t stand here and represent that. Not in my name, not in my community and not in my club.’

Webster, who was sexually assaulted as a teenager, is a lifelong Blades fan but stated that she would be deeply saddened if they recruited the Wales striker again.

‘He is a celebrity,’ she said, ‘They’re cheering him on. When I was four-years-old I cheered on a set of footballers, I was influenced by them and the people around them.

‘What is the influence going to be for the next generation, cheering on a convicted rapist — that he didn’t do anything wrong?

‘As much as I love my football club — which I 100 per cent do and support for United runs strongly in my family — it doesn’t run stronger than my morals.’ 

Evans, 25, scored 48 goals in 113 games for the Blades and was named in the Professional Footballers’ Association League One team of the year for the 2011-12 campaign, which was announced days after he was jailed for rape. 

His family, and the family of his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, who has stood by him throughout his trial and as he served half of a five-year sentence, have set up a website in support of the player.

It emerged that attempts to have his rape conviction quashed are to be fast-tracked through the watchdog that examines possible miscarriages of justice.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is to make his case a priority.

It would normally take around 18 months to examine a claim of miscarriage of justice. Instead, the commission has taken the unusual decision to examine Evans’ case within weeks.

‘We now expect our substantive investigation to begin within the next few weeks,’ said a spokesman.

At Valley Parade, Sheffield United beat Bradford City courtesy of a 66th-minute wonder strike by Robert Harris from outside the box and an 83rd-minute clincher from Marc McNulty.

Bradford had been reduced to 10 men five minutes into the second half when Stephen Darby was dismissed for a second yellow card offence.

In the TL Dallas Stand, which hosted the visiting fans, chants of ‘Super Chedwyn Evans,’ could be heard on several occasions during the match.

One fan unfurled a banner of the Welsh Dragon with ‘that boy, Ched Evans’ emblazoned upon it.

Webster was verbally abused on Twitter after speaking out against re-signing the player.

Some of his supporters claimed she was being hypocritical, highlighting a tweet she sent last month about seeing Mike Tyson in a hotel lobby and wanting to ask for his autograph.

Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday

Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 and served half of a six-year sentence. Webster said she did not register his past at the time.

‘In hindsight, I’m not proud of that tweet but the response has been another unfortunate example of berating someone for speaking out against rape.’

Webster said that Evans should not be allowed to play for United, especially while he continues ‘not to accept any responsibility for what happened that night’.

She added: ‘I’ve been abused for speaking out and the victim has had a hate campaign against her so I’m very sad and disappointed.

‘If that was their family, their daughter, their mother that had been raped, these people would not have that same opinion.’
