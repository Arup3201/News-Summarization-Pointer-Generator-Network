Decorated: Alexis Boyd, a U.S. Navy master-at-arms, was eight-months pregnant when she was killed

A twin baby who was the sole survivor after his eight-months pregnant mother was shot dead, lost his life yesterday.

Little Jael Huntley was just one-week-old when he was taken off life support at Florida's Winnie Palmer Hospital. 

Jael was delivered prematurely after his father allegedly killed the newborn's mother, Alexis Boyce, on November 14. His unborn twin brother couldn't be saved.

Alexis' father, Leon Huntley, confirmed the tragic death to Orlando Sentinal today.

He said a funeral for Alexis, 23, and her twin sons would be held after the Thanksgiving holiday.

Michael Boyce, 33, has been charged with three counts of first degree murder.

The former military officer remains in Orange County Jail without bond.

Orange County sheriff's detectives said Boyce admitted to shooting his wife in the head inside the Nikki Court, Orlando, apartment the newlywed couple shared with Alexis' parents.

The Huntleys were in the bedroom when they heard gunfire.

Leon Huntley said he saw Boyce holding a handgun in the living room and his daughter bleeding in a chair. He called 911.

'I had no fear. I demanded that he put the weapon down. Something got through to him and he put the weapon down,' he said. 

Alexis, a U.S. Navy master-at-arms, was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center. She and one unborn twin were pronounced dead on arrival.

Boyce initially told authorities his wife shot herself in the head, but changed his story when police showed him their evidence.

Boyce then claimed he had accidentally shot her, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

He was arrested on first-degree murder charges and taken to the Orange County Jail.

The couple, who police said did not have a history of domestic violence, had been married for about a year.

WFTV reported the newlyweds moved into the Huntley's home after Alexis found out she was pregnant.
