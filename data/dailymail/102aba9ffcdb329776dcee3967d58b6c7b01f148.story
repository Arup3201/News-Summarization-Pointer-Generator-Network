Esther Rantzen has been involved in a high-profile advertising campaign for the Accident Advice Line. This weekend they insisted that did everything to comply with the law

Companies sending out 'illegal' nuisance texts telling mobile users they could be entitled to thousands of pounds compensation for their 'accident' are raking in £175million a year, it emerged today.

'Claim farmers' bombarded phone users with an estimated 12.75million spam messages last month alone.

The shady companies are raking in up to £500 every time they refer a case to a 'no win, no fee' law firm - and £5 if the phone user replies saying 'stop' to end the unwanted texts.

Other users have had messages about 
debt management schemes and claiming compensation for the mis-selling of
payment protection insurance.

Once a response has been received the operators know the number is genuine and in use so can sell the details on.

When sent without the phone user's consent, the spam mail is classed as a 'cold call' - which is illegal.

Firms
sending out unwanted mail can be prosecuted and fined up to £500,000. 
But as messages are often sent out by eastern European or Indian 
companies from pay as you go mobile numbers they are very difficult to 
trace.

High profile campaign: Esther Rantzen in the Accident Advice Helpline Advert

The firms claim that people receiving spam mail will have opted in to have their details passed on to third party companies.

When someone responds with details of an accident their contact information is passed on to solicitors to assess whether the individual is eligible for compensation.

Law firms often pay little attention to how the client details were obtained, the Sunday Telegraph revealed.

The texts are sent out via computers to thousands of people urging them to make a compensation claim for their 'accident'.

They
typically cost around 2p a time to send out - but the expenditure is 
swiftly recovered by the vast fees that can be obtained.

When a mobile user replies with details of an incident they are passed on to claim firms who in turn give the details to solicitors.

Once a reporter provided details of an invented 'accident' they were given to leading claims firm the Accident Advice Helpline which has used television star Esther Rantzen in its adverts.

The firm, which has a turnover of £12million a year, admitted last night they face difficulties working out how client details have been obtained.

A spokesman representing the firm said that the Accident Advice Helpline were 'aware of their obligations' and said it was unlawful to send unsolicited text messages unless they opt in.

He added that the firm carried out 'due diligence' and always got written confirmation from suppliers that the law had been complied with.

But he added: 'The difficulty faced 
by companies in this field is that whilst due diligence is possible on 
the companies from whom information is purchased, those companies will 
in turn purchase information from third parties.'

There is no suggestion that Esther Rantzen has done anything wrong.

Regulators have called for referral fees to be banned to put an end to the shady practice.

Although
the mobile number the nuisance message sent from can be blocked or 
deactivated there is nothing preventing the firm from simply using 
another phone number.

Mike Lordan, chief of operations for the Direct Marketing Association, who are calling for a clampdown on unsolicited texts, said around three per cent of people reply to the unwanted messages.

'Our research shows that a large percentage of people are receiving spam and are unsure how to stop it and don't know who to make a complaint to,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'Mobile spam is causing distress to many people and seriously damaging the legitimate multi-million pound mobile marketing industry.

'Regulators have been unwilling or unable to take ownership and tackle this growing problem.'
