Every political leader needs to be able to explain their mission in life to voters.

But challenged to sum up his vision in a single word, Ed Miliband failed miserably, waffling on for 111 words which did little to shed light on his Labour plans for Britain.

The episode will do little to persuade his critics – including many in his own party – that he is too wordy and academic to make a connection with the average voter.

Labour leader Ed Miliband proved himself unable to sum up his leadership in a single word during a visit to Thurrock in Essex

Mr Miliband was speaking at an event in in Thurrock, Essex – a seat Labour is hoping to win back next year.

But in last week’s local elections Labour lost ground, raising fears Mr Miliband’s leadership is failing to connect with the electorate with a year until the general election.

After delivering a speech on immigration, Mr Miliband took questions from activists and journalists.

It was put to him that he is ‘too wordy and too academic’ and challenged to give just one word which ‘defines your leadership and tells voters what makes you different’.

But Mr Miliband floundered, choosing at first to give not one but two words: ‘One Nation.’

But perhaps realising that this abstract slogan, borrowed from 19th century Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, Mr Miliband went on to flesh out his ideas.

'I'll give you two: One Nation. 

'One Nation is an idea about how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential. 

'And that's what I'm about. 

'And that's what I'm about for Britain. 

'And I think it shows that Labour is a party that is reaching out to people across our country and that Labour has an answer. 

'And in the end, the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well? 

'Or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported? 

'And that is the big question for Britain. 

'And actually I believe that will be the big question for Britain at the next election.'

He said the soundbite was about ‘how you bring every person in the country to make a contribution and show their potential’, adding: ‘That's what I'm about.’

He claimed that was what he was ‘about for Britain’ and said Labour is ‘reaching out to people across our country and that Labour has an answer’.

Realising that no-one knew what the question was to which Labour had an answer, Mr Miliband continued: ‘In the end, the question is does that country succeed with people at the top doing well? Or does it succeed when actually ordinary people are supported?

‘And that is the big question for Britain. And actually I believe that will be the big question for Britain at the next election.’

Aides said Mr Miliband could sum up his leadership in a single word but 'chose not to'. 

However, the apparent inability to succinctly sum up what he stands for comes after a series of PR gaffes by the Labour leader.

In the run-up to the local and European elections last week he was skewered on live TV over the cost of his weekly shopping bill.

Having campaigned on the rising cost of living, accusing the government of being out of touch, he was unable to say how much he spent himself.

He suggested it might be £70 or £80 a week, but was told the average for a family of four was more than £100.

It later emerged he regularly shops in a smart delicatessen near his North London home where a loaf of bread costs £2.25.

The next day he embarked on a tour of 10 areas to promote 10 policies, but on the first stop he was pictured make a meal of eating a bacon sandwich.

After a set of embarrassing photographs were published online, the rest of the tour continued without publicity.

Asked about the sandwich yesterday, Mr Miliband said: ‘Honestly, really and truly, this is not what politics is about.’ 

Mr Miliband said he could describe his vision as 'One Nation', but it took him a lot of words even to explain that

Instead he faced fresh pressure over Labour's response to the rise of UKIP and tackling public concern about immigration.

He said: 'I am the son of immigrants. I am proud of the contribution my parents made to this country. I believe immigration benefits our country as a whole. But it needs to be properly managed.

'I have changed Labour’s position on immigration since 2010 because it is not prejudiced to worry about immigration, it is understandable.

'Labour would have controls when people arrive and leave here, we will tackle the undercutting of wages, we will ensure people in public services speak English and people need to earn their entitlements.'

He said: 'These are the right principles for our immigration policy.'

He added: 'Looking to the future, openness, concern for the poorest and a belief in the modern economy were not wrong. They were right.

'But it was not enough. That’s why as I have said since I became leader, there is no future for Labour saying we should simply pick up from where we left off in 2010.'
