A young researcher has re-opened the world's most southerly post office in Antarctica today, 50 years after it was abandoned.

Anna Malaos, 30, is operating as polar postmistress from a hut on Detaille Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, which has no telephone, Internet access, electricity or running water.

She is operating the post office, which will provide an international mail service, from a historic British base on a tiny outcrop of rock, surrounded by icebergs, glaciers and minke whales.

The world's most southerly post office has re opened in Antarctica today 50 years after it was abandoned

Anna, an expert in Antarctica and on secondment from her job as operations manager at the Antarctic Heritage Trust, is working in temperatures of minus 10C, which she says makes 'sticking stamps very tricky.'

'It's
 an honour to be a Polar Postmistress' said Anna, from Cambridge.

'Detaille
 Island was a British base built in the 1950s and, like every other 
British base built during that time, it had its own Post Office.

'It's a privilege to be able to re-open it after all this time and reconnect the building with the world.'

The isolated post office was closed in 1959 when solid sea ice prevented the base from being restocked for the season

The huts at Detaille Island were built in 1956 to provide a base from which to survey the Antarctic Peninsula.

The science undertaken at this station contributed geological and meteorological findings to the work of the International Geophysical Year of Cooperation in 1957.

But it was closed in 1959 when solid sea ice prevented the base from being restocked for the season. The men abandoned the base, taking with them only personal possessions and everything else was left behind.

Today, the base provides an important reminder of the science and living conditions that existed when the Antarctic Treaty was signed 50 years ago.

'We are re-opening the Post Office to breathe new life into the building at Detaille Island,' said Rachel Morgan, director of the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, a British charity which acts as custodian of several important historic buildings in the Antarctic.

'The base at Detaille Island, which was once a functioning science research station with its own Post Office, has a fascinating and important story to tell.'

Penguin post: Detaille is a small island just south of the Antarctic Circle and 11 miles east of Liard Island. It is home to a colony of 1,000 pairs of Adelie penguins

Around 25 ships are expected to call at the post office over the next four weeks and more than 300 letters will be hand-franked and dispatched to the rest of the world.

The letters will each receive a highly-prized Antarctic stamp and post mark and then travel by sea to the Falkland Islands where they will enter into the international mail system.

All the money raised from stamp sales will go towards saving the historic building and protecting it against the harsh Antarctic winter weather.

Anna will be assisted by Michael Powell, 49, from Crickhowell in South Wales who has over 25 years of Antarctic experience and Tudor Morgan, 41, from Monmouthshire.

The post office will have to close for the season at the end of the month, when the island sees 24-hour darkness.
