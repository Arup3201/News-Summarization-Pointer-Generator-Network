Standing at just 3ft 5ins, and tipping the scales at a flabbergasting 14st 5lbs (203lbs), this child weighs five times more than she should.

Meet nine-year-old Suman Khatun - one of the fattest kids in the world.

Captured on film, Suman is roughly the same weight as two Kylie Minogues, a Great Dane, or former England rugby player Jonny Wilkinson.

In one week, Suman, from West Bengal, India, munches her way through an incredible 14kgs of rice, 8kgs of potatoes, 8kgs of fish and about 180 bananas.

The shocking video also shows her gorging on her favourite Bengali sweets and cream cakes, dwarfing her classroom peers and seemingly struggling to get out of bed.

All my friends are thin, but I am fat,' says young Suman disconsolately.

'I have problems in standing, sitting, sleeping, playing and running with my friends.'

Big presence: Suman is conspicuously larger than her classroom pals

Her parents claim they are powerless to prevent her stomach-defying eating habits.

'I am very concerned about her future, as my other kids are normal,' says mum Beli Bibi.

'It's painful,' she adds.

'Painful': Mum Beli Bibi has requested the help of a local doctor to help manage Suman's weight

They have requested the help of the local doctor to manage her weight, who says:

'We think she has hyperthyroidism, but she needs to be examined.

'If it's not controlled, she might get diabetes or heart diseases.'
