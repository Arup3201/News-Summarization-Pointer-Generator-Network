Australian half-back Josh Drinkwater, who was London Broncos' leading scorer in their relegation season, has secured a return to the NRL with Wests Tigers.

The 22-year-old, who moved to the Broncos just under a year ago from St George Illawarra, has joined the Tigers on a two-year deal and began pre-season training on Wednesday.

'I'm very excited to be back home,' said Drinkwater, who scored 136 points from five tries and 58 goals in Super League in 2014. 'Once this opportunity came up, I was over the moon.'
