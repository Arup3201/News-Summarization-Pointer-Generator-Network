The average parent will spend £51,000 on their child before their 18th birthday but one mother has decided to spend almost half of that elsewhere.

Kerrie Williams,33, has spent over £20,000 on just seven lifelike dolls, while refusing to spend anything but the necessary on her two daughters.  

Kerrie a mother-of-two from Darlington, Country Durham has spent thousands on clothes, toys and accessories including a £1,000 pram for her collection of 'reborn' dolls.

Kerrie Williams has spend £20,000 on her collection of re-born babies 

The hyper-realistic toys are made from vinyl and designed to resemble human babies. And they don't come cheap with each doll costing between £150 and £400.

Kerrie now owns seven of the dolls, who each have an enviable collection of accessories, and her expensive habit has left her with little spare cash for her two real daughters Karina, 13 and Jade, 12.

Kerrie admits that she has to scrimp on what she buys for her daughters in order to spoil her fake babies and that Karina and Jade are becoming increasingly jealous of the attention their mother lavishes on her toys.

'My daughters are always asking me for new clothes. I tell them it's a waste of money because they will grow out of them' says Kerrie.

The part-time carer's collection of doll's clothes and accessories includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and converse. 

'Karina wanted a pair of Vans trainers and was furious when I told her I couldn't afford them.

'She gets jealous because I bought the reborns the same pair - but they can wear them forever.'

Kerrie began collecting reborn dolls to cope with a miscarriage she suffered in January 2012. She says that her fake babies helped to comfort her when no one else would.

'I was 12 weeks pregnant when I miscarried and I hit rock bottom afterwards. I just desperately wanted another child.

'My daughters were too old for my hugs and attention. They preferred to go out with their friends instead.

'I love my daughters so much, but babies are completely dependent on their mums, and all I wanted was another little one to hold.'

The doting mum saw a picture of a reborn on Facebook and instantly fell in love with the child's angelic plastic features and mistook it for an actual baby.

'He had perfect blonde hair and looked so peaceful. All I wanted was to scoop him up in my arms. I was so shocked when I discovered the baby, named Owen, was a reborn.

'He looked so realistic, so I called the manufacturer straight away to place an order.'

The first fake addition to Kerrie's family arrived in May 2012, but her daughters and now ex-partner Paul, 35, were unimpressed.

Kerrie says that their mother's new interest left the family a little confused. 

'I hoped the baby could replace the child we had lost - but instead my family said Owen was weird.'

Undeterred, she handpicked another six dolls over the course of the next year - splashing out on Serenity, Wynter, twins Corey and Cody, and vampire babies Lillith and Lilliana.

The mum also sold her first reborn, Owen, after deciding he no longer looked realistic when compared to her other dolls.

Last December she added a reborn named Till, who was designed to look like the child she lost.

Kerrie has also purchased two 'vampire babies' complete with fangs Lillian (left) and Lillith (right) 

'I provided the designer with my features and Paul's too' says Kerrie who adds that rather than solving her marital issues Till drove her and her partner further apart.

'I hoped Till would bring us closer together, but instead Paul became very uncomfortable with the dolls and banned them from sleeping in our bedroom.

'We split up soon after Till arrived.'

Single Kerrie often takes her babies out in one of their four pushchairs, visiting the local park, or ASDA superstore to try on baby clothes.

Despite the babies being entirely fake Kerrie says that the public like to interact with them. 

'I love getting the babies dressed up and taking them shopping around town with me.

'Most of the time people are lovely to them - they like to ask me how they're getting on.'

Occasionally Kerrie is met with harsh criticism from people who find her obsession odd. 

'Usually people believe they're real babies unless I tell them otherwise but sometimes I hear strangers laughing at me.

'They taunt the babies and say they look like dead children, but I think my babies are beautiful.'

One set of Kerrie's dolls have even began to frighten her daughters as they take the form of a Halloween character 

'I have two vampire babies, named Lillith and Lilliana. The moment I saw them I knew they had to live with me.

'My daughters find them scary but they're as special to me as real children.'

With four moses baskets, four prams and more than 50 pairs of shoes, Kerrie's daughters have had to get used to sharing their home.

'I know the girls are jealous because I've spent twice as much on the babies.'

But the reborn addict's plan to help her daughter Karina fall in love with her plastic brothers and sisters failed.

Kerrie purchased a new baby, named Saffron, in July designed to look exactly like her eldest daughter, which she hoped would bring the family closer, however Karina was unimpressed.

'I designed a special doll to look just like Karina did as a baby and I hoped she'd bring us closer together as a family.

'But Karina doesn't like her and thinks she's ugly.'

However this has not deterred Kerrie who is now in the process of designing her latest doll to look like her younger daughter Jade.

Kerrie says that although she spends more on her fake babies they will never be more loved than her actual daughters, however this is not going to stop her spoiling them. 

'Reborn babies can never replace how special my real children are, but I still love my dolls - no matter what anyone thinks.

'They're always worth spoiling - babies this perfect are worth every penny.'

Although the dolls already take up all the spare room in her house, Kerrie has plans to expand her plastic brood and in December, doll Megan will join the clan. 

It was her interest in dolls that eventually led to the break down of her marriage with her husband leaving shortly after she bought home Ti

Although Kerrie says that her dolls will never make up for what she lost they have provided her with some comfort when no one else could
