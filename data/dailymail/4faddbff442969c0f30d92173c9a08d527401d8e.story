A senior carer at a nursing home routinely drugged six dementia patients with unprescribed medication so she could get a good night’s sleep on the job, a court has heard.

Mirela Aionoaei allegedly gave four women and two men anti-insomnia, anti-depressant and anti-psychotic pills before pushing two chairs together to form a makeshift bed and turning off the lights while working the night shifts.

The drugs were so powerful that the poisoned patients, who previously would wander around during the night, fell into a sleep so deep they had to be taken to their beds in wheelchairs.

The jury heard how concerned staff at
the Southern Cross-owned home in Hayes, West London, became suspicious 
after finding that the patients were unsteady on their feet and 
suffering from slurred speech whenever Aionoaei was on duty.

‘The residents were being poisoned, 
of that there is no doubt,’ prosecutor Guy Dilliway-Parry told Harrow 
Crown Court on Monday. ‘The defendant liked to sleep when on duty. Why 
else put two chairs together?’

‘She was seen to administer on many 
occasions over a considerable period of time and the residents would 
fall asleep almost straight away.’

Aionoaei, 37, has pleaded not guilty 
to six counts of administering a poison or noxious substance to the six 
residents of Ashwood Care Centre between July 1 and December 31, 2010.

Mirela Aionoaei is on trial at Harrow Crown Court where a jury was told she drugged six dementia patients

Aionoaei, who lives in a £150,000 
one-bedroom flat in Hayes, studied at the University of Westminster 
according to her Facebook account.

At the time of the alleged offences 
there were 22 residents on the dementia ward, aged between 58 and over 
100 years old. Aionoaei was the senior member of staff in charge and the
only one permitted to dispense medicine as a trained and authorised 
health professional.

‘They all suffered from mental health
conditions that left them vulnerable and unaware of their 
surroundings,’ Mr  Dilliway-Parry said. ‘They could do very little for 
themselves.

‘Some would walk around at night and 
needed hourly checks, but Aionoaei would put two chairs together and go 
to sleep, even if the residents were walking around. Her priority seemed
to be to get some sleep herself.’

'The residents were being poisoned, of that there is no doubt.'

Prosecutor Guy Dilliway-Parry

A suspicious colleague began 
observing Aionoaei because the residents became excessively drowsy only 
when she was on duty and she was keen to get them into bed only 30 
minutes into her shift.

‘She was observed approaching 
residents with a glass of orange juice in one hand and observed putting a
small cream-coloured tablet in the residents’ mouths and they would all
be asleep within five to eight minutes.

‘Other staff noticed the residents 
were very sleepy after being administered medication by Aionoaei. They 
would be unsteady on their feet and slur their words more than usual.’ 

On January 31 last year the 
suspicions were reported to police and hair samples were taken from a 
total of nine residents – one at a post-mortem examination – and six 
returned positive for the presence of unprescribed drugs.

Among them were a fast-acting 
sleeping pill, which usually works for six hours, a drug prescribed to 
patients with depression and panic attacks, which has a side-effect of 
drowsiness, and an anti-psychotic drug used to treat restlessness.

‘They had been administered over a considerable period of time,’ added the prosecutor. 
‘It shows they were being drugged.’ 

When questioned by police, Aionoaei 
admitted pushing two chairs together, but denied she slept, and claimed 
the reason for turning off the light near her was to prevent residents 
being disturbed.

The trial continues.
