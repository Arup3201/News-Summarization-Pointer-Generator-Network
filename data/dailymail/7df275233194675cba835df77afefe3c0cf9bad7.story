Caught: 33-year-old Walter Ruck was found by Oregon police in the middle of assaulting a woman 

Workers at a Nevada telemarketing call center ended up saving a woman's life after hearing screams as she was being attacked on the other end of the phone.  

Tina Garcia of Americare Health and Nutrition in Las Vegas was making a call as part of her job, but when the phone was answered she heard the most shocking noises down the line. 

She called one of her co-workers over to listen across the call to hear the woman screaming for her life and yelling 'please don't kill me.'

'She said, 'I don't think this is a joke. Something's happening. I think this lady is getting hit,' Garcia said. 'The young lady on the other end of the phone never said hello. There was just a horrible whimper.'

The call center company kept the line open so that the call to a woman in Lebanon, Oregon would be recorded for evidence. 

Investigators said the woman's phone was in her back pocket during the attack and of course had no idea whatsoever that the phone had picked up and that someone had called the police. 

Deputies say the quick-thinking actions of the call center workers likely  saved the woman's life. 

Long distance call: Walter Ruck was caught by police in Oregon after the screams from a woman he was assaulting were heard by telemarketer Tina Garcia in Las Vegas, Nevada

'We were not going to hang up the phone. As far as I was concerned, and as far as the people in that room were concerned, we were the only lifeline she had,' said Garcia told News 8.

Instead of called the local Las Vegas police, they instead decided to look up police in Oregon.

The company called the Linn County Sheriff's Office in Oregon and they went along to check things out.

Their suspicions proved correct. When police arrived on the scene they heard a woman calling for help and heard a man telling her to be quiet.

Overheard: Tina Garcia heard traumatic screams down the phone. She says that she heard  a woman screaming for her life and yelling 'please don't kill me'

Quick-thinking: Workers at the call center were about to call Las Vegas police, but decided to look up local Oregon officials. Linn County Sheriff's office sent police to the woman's home and likely saved her life

Deputies forced their way into the home to find 33-year-old Walter Ruck holding the woman from behind.

Police say that the woman was attempting to flee, crying and gasping for air.

When the door was opened she ran past the cops and out and out of the door. 

She told police that in the moments prior to their arrival she had been held down, physically assaulted and smothered with pillows and blankets during the attack.

At one point Ruck allegedly threatened the woman with a rifle holding the barrel near his face and telling her to 'pull the trigger'.

Ruck was booked into the Linn County Jail on charges of fourth degree assault, menacing and strangulation.

Officials are not releasing the name of the victim.
