Police are hunting a real-life 'Bonnie and Clyde' teenage couple accused of stealing two cars and leading police on a high-speed chase.

Breanna Gomez, 15, is believed to be on the run with her boyfriend Spencer Linville, 16, and two other teenagers, including 18-year-old Blake Bergeron.

The four allegedly fled Wisconsin in a stolen car on Tuesday, before outrunning police in a high-speed pursuit through Denver, Colorado on Thursday.

ABC News reported the group dumped the car in Colorado, before allegedly stealing a light blue Chrysler Town and 
Country minivan.

The minivan, with Colorado license plate 876WZS, was reported stolen in Roggen.

The teens are believed to be heading to Riverside, California, where Linville's father has a fishing boat.

Authorities have issued an alert for Breanna because she is an insulin-dependent diabetic who may have seizures without her medications.

The Denver Post reports the troubled teen uses the insulin, found in the abandoned vehicle, five times a day.

Breanna's worried Jerry Carpenter has implored his granddaughter's travel companions to 'drop her off at a medical facility, a 
police station, anywhere'.

'Her insulin was left [in the car]. If she doesn't have that, she will die,' Carpenter said.

'We love her and we just want
 her to get treatment. Of course she is going to have 
to pay the price for whatever she's doing. She's responsible for her 
actions, but that does not mean we love her any less.'

Meanwhile, Breanna has just been released from juvenile detention  after a six-month stint for various run-ins with police and cutting classes.

'She's been troubled for a while. We've been trying to help her,' Carpenter told ABC News.

'She was supposed to come and see us on Sunday [and] there was even talk of placing her with us.'

He said Breanna, who recently dyed her hair black, was wearing an ankle monitor but did not charge it. Authorities said it stopped transmitting around December 18 or 19.
