Australia star Jarryd Hayne has sensationally quit rugby league to pursue a career in American football.

The full-back, who would have been one of the Kangaroos' key players in the upcoming Four Nations Series, has announced that he has secured a conditional release from his contract at Parramatta Eels.

The 26-year-old World Cup-winner does not have any opportunities lined up in the United States but is hoping to earn trial opportunities in the NFL over the next year.

Parramatta Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne has been one of the stars of the NRL in recent years

Hayne was outstanding for New South Wales, above, in their 2014 State of Origin series win over Queensland 

Hayne, who issued a statement and then spoke at a press conference hastily arranged by the Eels, said: "It's been about 12 months now that I've seriously considered this.

"I've passed the fear stage. I've wrestled with my emotions and realised that this is where my heart lies.

"I feel like I've done everything in the game. What more is there to achieve other than a premiership (title win)?

"There's goals, but you've got to enjoy the journey more so. I feel that the journey of going over there and having a crack at the NFL is far greater than anything here.

"I'm a kid following his heart, following his dream."

Hayne was recently named as joint-winner of the Dally M medal, the highest individual award in Australia's NRL competition, for 2014.

His departure is another blow for Australia coach Tim Sheens, who is already without a raft of senior players for the Four Nations tournament also featuring England, New Zealand and Samoa. Hayne will be replaced in the squad by Penrith full-back Matt Moylan.

Jarryd Hayne is a massive fan of the NFL and regular tweets about the sport
