Chuba Akpom says he is hungry for the chance to become a first-team regular at Arsenal.

The 19-year-old forward made his second appearance of the season as a late substitute in the Gunners' disappointing 2-0 defeat at Southampton.

And Akpom hopes to keep catching the eye of manager Arsene Wenger, after scoring nine goals in as many games for the club's Under 21 side this season.

The youngster told the club's official website: 'I'm really feeling part of the team.

'I'm starting to train with them a bit more and I'm getting more of a feel about how it is to be on the bench.

'I'm just dying to get on every game and every minute counts.

'I try my best to make the most of each opportunity that I get, so when I went out there I just gave 100 per cent.

'Every game I'm hoping to get an opportunity - I just want to play. I'm hungry for it now.

'I want to show the boss what I'm made of and I think that I'm ready. I think I can have a good impact on the team. Hopefully I get a chance.'
