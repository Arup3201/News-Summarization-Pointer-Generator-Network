Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Greece coach following their shock 1-0 defeat to the Faroe Islands in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night.

Ranieri, who had only been in charge for four months since taking over from former boss Fernando Santos after the 2014 World Cup, leaves Greece rock bottom of Group F following four successive defeats so far.

The writing looked to be on the wall for the former Chelsea and Monaco boss after the game, with a statement from Hellenic Football Federation president Giorgos Sarris all about confirming Ranieri would soon be relieved of his duties.

Sarris said: 'Following today's devastating result for the national team, I take full responsibility for the most unfortunate choice of coach, which has resulted in such a poor image of the national team being put before the fans.

'The governing board will convene and take responsibility among all the members to make the necessary changes needed to avoid a repeat of such an embarrassing night.'

The defeat at home to the Faroe Islands, who in turn recorded just their 20th win since beginning international play in 1988, represented a new low.

Joan Edmundsson's 61st minute goal settled the contest in Athens, and earned the Faroe Islands their first competitive victory in three years.

The 63-year-old, whose first job in international management was with Greece, took responsibility for the latest setback for the 2004 European Champions after the game, but remained defiant in his post-match press conference.

He told UEFA.com: 'I have no words to explain what happened. We all wanted to record our first victory in the group. But the Faroes deserved to win as they created more chances to score. Only hard work can get us out of this situation.'

Despite this, Ranieri will take charge of Greece for one final time in a international friendly against Serbia and Montenegro on Tuesday.
