They say Manchester United’s defeat by Swansea was the best thing that could have happened, exposing their shortcomings before it is too late to act.

Perhaps the same theory can be applied to Newcastle United. For while their 2-0 loss to champions Manchester City was rich in spirit, skill, endeavour and enthusiasm, it was nonetheless lacking one key ingredient — a shot on target.

Indeed, they were the only top-flight team not to trouble an opposition goalkeeper during the opening weekend.

Blunt: £6million signing Emmanuel Riviere failed to get his name on the scoresheet at St James' Park

Under pressure: Ayoze Perez, left, found his way blocked by the formidable figure of Vincent Kompany

The Magpies failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last season and the suspicion is that an impotent offence could undermine their progress this time around.

Final balls were wayward — shooting likewise — and, for all their attacking intent, they lacked the penalty-box instinct of a David Silva or Sergio Aguero, the players who ultimately settled this affair.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini agreed. ‘I didn’t feel Newcastle had clear chances to score except in the last two minutes of the game,’ said the Chilean, referencing Ayoze Perez’s goal-bound shot deflected wide by a sliding Fernando.

Alan Pardew’s Tyneside tenure has been defined by goalscorers: Andy Carroll, Demba Ba, Papiss Cisse and, last season, Loic Remy.

Emmanuel Riviere — a £6m signing from Monaco — is the man charged with filling his boots — and the net — this season.

Comeback trail: Dutch playmaker Siem de Jong should help Newcastle get firing on all cylinders

But Pardew feels goals reside in other areas of the squad, even if some of those players remain in the treatment room.

‘We’re still missing Papiss (Cisse) and Siem de Jong, two massive players for us that we’ve paid a financial outlay on,’ he said, when asked if he would be re-entering the transfer market.

‘They’re big players. So no, I feel once they’re in and around the squad we’ll score goals.

Impressive: Remy Cabella in possession during a promising display against the Premier League champions

‘We were playing the champions today and sometimes you don’t get any shots against the champions. But I thought we had a really good go.’

Playmaker Remy Cabella was the pick of Pardew’s five debutants and the manager likened him to City’s Silva.

But every Cabella needs a goalscorer to exploit his cunning. And to that end Newcastle remain short. Pardew has until September 1 to do something about it.
