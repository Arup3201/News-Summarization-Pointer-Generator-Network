He loves food and kisses, and he’s known for his inquisitive nature.

But Bud the brave is also one very tough cookie – more than a match for the football fan who punched him during violent clashes in Newcastle at the weekend.

Yesterday the police horse was safe at home at his stables near Leeds, where he was said to be ‘totally fine and resting up’ after the drama.

Bud, of West Yorkshire Police’s mounted section, was on duty controlling crowds at Sunday’s match between Sunderland and Newcastle when violence broke out.

Video emerged of one fan swinging a punch at Bud, a shire-cross who has been with the force for seven years.

The alleged attacker was wrestled to the ground by officers and arrested. Today Northumbria Police said the 45-year-old man had been bailed pending further inquiries.

Shocking: The blow caused the horse to rear up in pain, almost throwing its rider to the ground

Twenty-nine supporters have been arrested following Sunday’s violence, in which three police officers were injured.

Video footage of the skirmishes showed crowds picking up empty  bottles and throwing them towards police after Newcastle lost 3-0 to Sunderland.

Inspector Trevor Thackeray, of West Yorkshire’s mounted section, said: ‘We are pleased to say that Bud is totally fine and resting up after Sunday’s eventful operation in Newcastle.

‘Our police horses are used to dealing
with all types of disorder so, while the images on the news may have 
looked shocking, Bud wasn’t hurt and his regular training ensures that 
he is acclimatised to this type of situation.

‘The
West Yorkshire Police mounted section is a well-regarded unit and  our 
horses and officers are hugely experienced, so Bud will be back on the 
streets the next time duty calls.’

A spokesman for the force said that  Bud was known for his ‘inquisitive personality’ and added: ‘He loves food and kisses.

‘He makes a good police horse as he is very trusting of his riders and adapts well to the training that he’s put through. He’s now on rest days but will be back on patrol on Thursday.’

Bud has worked at many football matches in the past, and recently helped with crowd control at an English Defence League demonstration.

Yesterday a spokesman for Newcastle United said: ‘The club will take the strongest possible action against those involved in the disturbances and will impose immediate lifetime bans on all those found guilty.

‘These deplorable individuals have no place at Newcastle United and bring shame on the club and the vast majority of its proper, law-abiding, fans.’

Supporters were allegedly seen throwing firecrackers and glass bottles, and setting fire to wheelie bins following Newcastle's 3-0 defeat to rivals Sunderland
