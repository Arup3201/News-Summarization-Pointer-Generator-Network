A drunken driver who struck and killed two teenage cousins on a southern New Jersey roadway two years ago has pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter charges.

Cape May County prosecutors say 33-year-old Joshua Malmgren of Middle Township is expected to receive two nine-year state prison terms when he’s sentenced December 5.

Prosecutors say Malmgren was driving drunk and texting in July 2012 when his sport utility vehicle hit 15-year-old Nioami Lazicki and her cousin 13-year-old Ashley Dauber of Philadelphia on a Middle Township road.

Guilty plea: Two years after hitting and killing two girls in his car, Joshua Malmgren has admitted to drunken driving and texting before the tragic incident

Cousins: Ashley Dauber (left) and Nioami Lazicki (right) were walking home from a playground when they were hit by Malmgren, who veered off the road while texting and had a blood-alcohol reading of double the legal limit

Close: Ashley Dauber (right) was visiting from Philadelphia when the tragedy occurred. The younger sister of Nioami Lazicki (left) managed to escape Malmgren's car

Lazicki’s 14-year-old sister was walking with them but was able to get out of the way of the vehicle.

The three girls were walking home from a playground along Bayshore Road near the Green Creek Firehouse in Middle Township on July 31, 2012, when the incident occurred.

Malmgren was driving in the eastbound lanes of Bayshore Road when he veered into the shoulder and hit the two girls.

They were both pronounced dead at the scene.

Plea deal: Malmgren initially pleaded not guilty and rejected an earlier plea bargain that would have seen him serve 25 years in jail

'She suddenly had an urge to turn over her shoulder and she’d seen the headlights and got out of the way,' Bill Gaston, Nioami’s father told CBS of his surviving daughter.

'By the time she screamed, this guy was right on top of them.'

Malmgren was found to have a blood alcohol reading of .183, more than twice the legal limit.

He also admitted to having taken the prescription painkiller Tramadol and anti-anxiety drug Clonazepam in combination with the booze.

When police arrived just minutes after the accident, they found Malmgren sitting under a tree, crying and hugging his knees, reports the Press of Atlantic City.

Elizabeth Melli, the mother of Malmgren's two children and his on-off partner, testified in court that he had been on an alcohol and pain-pill binge of several days when the accident happened.

Malmgren initially pleaded not guilty and had rejected a plea agreement that required him to serve 25 years, reports the Press of Atlantic City.

He pleaded guilty under a new plea agreement.

Under New Jersey state law, the No Early Release Act, he will have to serve 85 per cent of the sentence, or 15.3 years before he is eligible for parole.
