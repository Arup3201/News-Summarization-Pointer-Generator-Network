A 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl have been arrested and charged with the murder of a schoolgirl who has been missing since April.

Chadd Raymond, 16, and Chloe Thomas, 17, from Edmond, Oklahoma City, have been detained in connection with the disappearance of 16-year-old Anne Hill.

Missing: The schoolgirl vanished from her home in April after telling her mother she was going to a friend's house to watch a movie 

Known to her friends as Annie Jo, she had just received the keys to her first car, a white Chevrolet, and seemed to be upset by an early curfew, so she stopped answering her phone at 11pm the night she vanished. 

Her car was found in the Edmond, Oklahoma, more a week later when a resident recognized it from a flier that had been handed out in the area.

A week after she vanished, her mother Lori Hill told KFOR NewsChannel 4: 'Vivacious, outgoing, never met a stranger,' said Lori Hill in April. 'That's not a kid that's planning on running away. That's not a kid that doesn't want to be with her family. That's my Annie Jo.'

While she was missing, her mother also left a voice mail message on her phone which said: 'Anne, I hope that’s you, I love you and miss you. 

'I’ll come get you wherever you are, just leave me a message or call your brothers, we all want you home. Anne, I hope it’s you.'

A search warrant was reportedly issued at an Oklahoma City apartment complex in connection with Hill's disappearance.

According to police, Thomas came to police headquarters Friday afternoon, was interviewed by investigators and subsequently arrested.

On Saturday morning, Raymond was arrested at his home in northwest Oklahoma City. The pair are both facing first-degree murder charges. 

It comes after a break in the case last week, where private investigators were led to a pond by an anonymous tip.

The water was drained, however officials would not say whether something was found. 

Sergeant Jennifer Wardlow from Oklahoma City Police told reporters Monday that homicide detectives have arrested a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl in the case.

However she insisted that the investigation is still ongoing. 

Edmond Public Schools, the district where the two suspects were students, issued a statement after hearing of the pair's arrests.

It read: 'Edmond Public Schools is shocked and saddened to learn that current student, Chadd Raymond, and former student Chloe Thomas, were each arrested on murder complaints this past weekend in connection with the disappearance of Piedmont teenager, Anne Hill. 

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Hill’s family and friends during this extremely difficult time.' 

Help: The campaign to find her has continued for seven months, with fliers and posters being put up all around her neighborhood
