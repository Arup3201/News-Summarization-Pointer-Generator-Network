A spider with a unique body pattern has given a photographer a fit of the giggles – because it looks like party animal Miley Cyrus.

The yellow arachnid appears to be pulling the signature face of the We Can’t Stop singer – eyes wide open and tongue sticking out.

Wildlife photographer Kevin Kiran captured the picture of the bizarre creature while on a photography trip in a forest near Ponmudi, India.

While focusing his shot on the tiny spider Kevin, 24, realised it's body appeared to have a face-like pattern.

With two black spots looking like eyes and a red dot on single 
rectangular black patch, Kevin said it looked as if the spider was 
poking its tongue out.

Kevin,
 who works as a database administrator, said: ‘I found this guy in a 
calamus plant with a huge square shaped orb web. Its bright yellow 
colour attracted me.

‘It looked like the spider had two eyes, a nose and tongue poking out to make fun of others.'

‘Through
 my photography I want to show the world there are a lot of beautiful 
things like this spider out there. I try to spend some time in my garden
 at least once in a week.

‘Friends, relatives, viewers in Facebook have all been amazed to see this special spider.’

No one can be sure whether the colourful arachnid is as keen on twerking as its human lookalike.

But
 we can be fairly certain that, just like hard-working Miley, the little
 spider can be found sticking its tongue out almost every day… on the 
web.
