Lea T made history this week by becoming the first transgender model to front a global cosmetics brand. 

The 33-year-old Brazilian has been a big name in fashion for the last few years, featuring in high end magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair and Love. 

But her latest job as the face of American haircare giant Redken's Chromatics campaign is a huge leap in the way that traditional organisations treat transgender people.

Lea T 

Age: 33 

Nationality: Brazilian  

In 1981, Lea T was born as a boy called Leandro in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. She comes from a close-knit family with three siblings and her father is the famous footballer Toninho Cerezo.

Despite being aware that she was different from other children, Lea refused to give any thought to the idea of changing her sex in her late teens and early twenties. 

It was only when she became friends with the now-Givency head designer Riccardo Tisci while he was studying at St Central St Martins that Lea began to give any thought to becoming transgender. 

She later recalled in an interview with French Vogue: 'One night he encouraged me to wear pumps to a party. 

'We went shopping for 'drag queen' shoes and we bleached my eyebrows. It was a revelation.'

Lea then went on to become Riccardo's muse.  

In 2008, Lea started hormone replacement therapy and in 2012 underwent full gender reassignment surgery in Thailand.  

She has had several high-profile modelling jobs, including a 2011 cover of LOVE magazine where she was pictured kissing Kate Moss.

She told CNN about her the petition had affected her, saying: '
