Brad Pitt says that even though his mother came out against President Obama and same-sex marriage, he is very happy about the election and feels that the country is headed in the right direction by allowing equal rights to all couples.

In an interview with People magazine, Pitt said that he respectfully disagrees with his mother's position and has been an outspoken advocate for legalizing gay marriage throughout the U.S.

'Sure, I believe in it. I believe in the idea of fairness and equality in our country. I truly believe it's a matter of time. The next generation isn't frightened by anything,' Pitt said.

Different opinions: Jane Pitt, seen with Brad and Angelina at the Oscars, is a conservative Christian who does not support Obama but the Hollywood couple are famously liberal

He explained that while he and partner Angelina Jolie, who he called 'Mama' throughout the interview, are planning to get married in the near future, they believe that it is a right that should be extended to everyone.

'I come from a Christian family, and (gay marriage) goes against Christian beliefs, as far as what's going to get you into heaven or not. My argument is, that you may be as you believe, and it may be true in the end0 I don't think so- but let your God make that call, and in the meantime we live in a country where everyone should be treated equally, so let's treat everyone equally,' he said.

Pitt's political beliefs were called into question when his mother Jane wrote a letter to her local paper claiming that Mr Obama should not serve a second term because he lacks moral conviction and backs gay marriage and ‘the killing of unborn babies’.

Mrs Pitt wrote in her letter to  the Springfield News-Leader, in Missouri: ‘I hope all Christians give their vote prayerful consideration because voting is a sacred privilege and a serious responsibility’.

Brad, 49, said that discussions don't get too heated over the family dinner table at holidays, explaining: 'We grew up with a very specific set of rules and challenging those rules has never been a closed door. Certainly our views can evolve. I don't see them as letting go.'

Pitt once said of his mother’s 
outspoken views: ‘She’s very loving, very open, genuine, and it’s 
hilarious because she always gets painted as a she-devil.’

In
December 2011, the 48-year-old actor told the talk show host Ellen 
DeGeneres, who is herself a lesbian: 'I've said that we would not be 
getting married until everyone in this country had the right to get 
married.'

The Hollywood 
power couple, who have six children together, eventually gave in and 
announced their engagement in April, but have yet to set a date.
