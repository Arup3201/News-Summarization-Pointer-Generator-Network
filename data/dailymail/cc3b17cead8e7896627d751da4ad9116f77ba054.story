Police have issued a warning to drone users to be aware of the law with regards to flying them over famous landmarks.

With drones having been a popular Christmas gift, there is set to be an increase in the numbers flown over public events, stadiums and tourist attractions.

However, the law states that drones must not be flown within 150 metres of any congested area, or within 50 metres of buildings not owned by their operator. There are also exclusion areas around airports.

Police have warned drone users to be aware of the law when flying their machines around the country

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Chief Inspector Nick Aldworth, of the Met's Specialist Operations unit, said: 'I compare them to cars. They are perfectly legal to own but it is very easy to break the laws when you are driving.

'Our concern is that in the New Year we will see a lot of these things being flown in London and there is a potential for people to wander into criminal territory. 

'We also recognise that people will use these devices for criminal purposes and we want to send them a message too.'

Stores reported a 24 per cent increase in sales of drones, which could be purchased for as little as £30. 

There have been a rise in the number of drone flights over stadiums and public events

Last year a drone almost crashed into a passenger jet flying near Heathrow Airport

Numerous videos have been posted on social networks showing drones flying over London landmarks such as the Shard, the London Eye and Tower Bridge, possibly in breach of the law. 

There is also the growing worry that rather than drones being used to capture stunning landscapes, they are now being associated with harassing and spying on people.

In addition, drones have even found their way onto flight paths in one of the more worrying developments. 

A drone flying near Heathrow almost crashed into a passenger jet in July last year– raising fears that 2014's must-have Christmas gift could cause a disaster in the skies over Britain.

The remote-controlled device, flown by an unidentified amateur, was spotted by the airliner's pilot but alarmingly was not detected by air traffic control radars.

The UK Airprox Board, the air safety panel that investigates near misses, gave the incident the highest risk rating of A, meaning there was a 'serious risk of collision'.

The Airbus A320 that can carry up to 180 passengers was flying at an altitude of 700ft on the afternoon of July 22 when the pilot spotted the drone. He reported the near miss and an inquiry was launched by the board.

Worryingly, investigators were unable to identify the drone and it disappeared after the sighting.

And back in May 2014 a 74-seater aeroplane was travelling over Southend when the pilot spotted the remote-controlled quadcopter 'very close' to the right wing-tip.

An investigation launched into the incident recorded the risk of collision as 'high' 

The UK Airprox Board report into the inciden revealed how the ATR72 twin-engine turboprop airliner was travelling at 1,500ft as it came in to land at Southend Airport when the pilot noticed the drone.

The report revealed how the pilot informed the control tower at Southend Airport over the sighting and told the operator how the object was 'too close' to the plane.

He told the tower that he thought he had seen a 'remote-control helicopter with a very small engine' before confirming it was a black and red quadcopter.

A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority, said: 'People using drones should apply common sense when thinking about where to fly their devices. It is clearly irresponsible to fly any kind of drone close to an airport or in a town centre, for example.

'Users should take a good look around at their environment before each and every flight. If any potential exists for conflict with other aircraft, people, vehicles or buildings, then try somewhere else. 

'Drones are subject to aviation rules and regulations and anyone breaching those rules can be prosecuted.'
