Women's Hour presenter Jane Garvey has claimed that it is still a man's media world

Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey isn't one to mince her words.

Along with her co-presenter Jenni Murray the established DJ encourages lively debate on her Radio 4 women's interest show, whether the topic is Fifty Shades Of Grey or feminism in the workplace.

Now, ahead of her new radio series on female pioneers, the broadcaster has slammed the sexist radio industry for reducing women to giggling sidekicks.

Writing for the Telegraph's Wonder Women column the 49-year-old has revealed that she wasn't surprised about the 'kerfuffle' surrounding the appointment of the two female presenters to the rather old-fashioned Today Show.

Earlier this month Mishal Husain became the show's second female anchor as she joined Sarah Montague at the controls.

The 40-year-old Cambridge graduate's arrival raised eyebrows and while BBC director-general 
Tony Hall claimed that he was 'very pleased' to have more female voices on the programme, Garvey warns that there is still a long way to go.

Talking about men still dominating the airwaves she says in the blog: 'The truth is, it's still a man's media 
world and we're a little bit lucky to be a part of it. Too often, women 
on radio are parked right up Sidekick Alley: a stooge, an obliging 
giggler, someone to facilitate the Wildean wit of the Big Man at the 
controls.'

Garvey has worked in the industry for 25 years and claims that she has never felt hard done by as a female presenter, crediting the 'enlightened' John Pickles for giving her the chance to host her first breakfast show in the 1990s.

Throughout her broadcast career she has been inspired by female DJs like Annie Nightingale and Janice Long and TV talent including Esther Rantzen and Cilla Black, but says that female success stories like theirs seem to be too few and far between: 'We’ve come a long way, but we’re still 
going quite slowly. Men still dominate at peak 
times: breakfast and drive, the programmes you want as a 
presenter, with a chance of an audience and a bigger share of the 
resources.'

Garvey puts this down to the perceived lack of authority or 'gravitas' of a female presenter, and goes on to questions the personality traits of a successful radio talent: 'I do sometimes wonder, late at night, whether the rather toxic mix of arrogance and insecurity required to do this sort of gig is more common in men than women,' she ponders.

Mishal Husain, pictured

 Middle East where her father practised as a doctor.

After
 spending time in Saudi Arabia, she returned to the UK at the age of 12 
to complete her education at Cobham Hall, an independent school in 
Cobham, Kent.

Ms 
Husain went on to studied Law at New Hall, Cambridge, and then a 
Master's degree in International and Comparative Law at the European 
University Institute in Florence, Italy.

Ms Husain began her journalistic career aged 18 in Islamabad at Pakistan's English-language newspaper The News.

After
 two years at Bloomberg Television in London in 1996, where she was a 
producer and sometime presenter, she joined the BBC as a junior producer
 in the newsroom and for the News 24 channel.

During her rise through the ranks, she had stints at the Economics and Business Unit,
 the daily Breakfast programme, on Asia Business Report (based in 
Singapore), and as a presenter of business news on both BBC World News 
and the BBC News Channel.

From
 September 2002 she was the corporation's Washington correspondent, 
serving as the main news anchor through the buildup to the invasion of 
Iraq and during the war.

She named as part of BBCs Olympic Presenting team and presented News at 10.

In
 July she was announced as the first Muslim presenter of BBC Radio 4's 
Today programme and the show's second ever female anchor.
