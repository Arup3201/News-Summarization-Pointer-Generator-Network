An Ohio police chief is accused of pointing a gun at an employee's head, refusing to investigate a sexual assault claim against another officer and lying to investigators about both incidents. 

Put-in-Bay Police Chief Robert 'Ric' Lampela was charged with four misdemeanor counts by the Ohio Attorney General's office after a misconduct investigation. 

Lampela is facing one count of aggravated menacing, one count of dereliction of duty and two counts of falsification, according to documents filed yesterday.

According to investigators, Lampela refused to investigate the sexual assault claim because he wanted to'prevent negative publicity for the Put-In-Bay Police Department' (pictured above) 

Put-in-Bay, which has close to 500 residents, is one of about 20 islands located in the shallow western end of Lake Erie.

According to investigators, Lampela refused 'to allow police reports to be filed or an investigation to commence after two employees reported another employee allegedly sexually assaulted them' because he wanted to 'prevent negative publicity for the Put-In-Bay Police Department'.

That alleged incident occurred in 2003. 

Lampela is also accused of pointing a gun at police officer Jeff Herald while the two discussed the Bill of Rights in 2012, the Mansfield News Journal reported. 

An officer who observed the incident was so concerned for Herald's safety that he unstrapped his holster in case he had to draw his gun. 

It is believed that Lampela's gun was unloaded at the time. 

The Attorney General's Office believes Lampela made false statements about both incidents to an Ottawa County Sheriff's Office investigator.

He said 'the sexual assault was never officially reported to him', the Sandusky Register reported.

Lampela is due to attend a hearing on March 25 in Ottawa County Municipal Court.

It is unclear if Lampela is still running the Put-in-Bay Police Department. 

Village Councilman Jeff Koehler said the charges against Lampela are serious even though they are misdemeanors.

He said: 'Anything in this capacity of alleged wrongdoing usually results in a suspension.'  

No other officers were charged and no further charges will be filed unless more evidence surfaces.

Special prosecutor Margaret Tamaro called the conduct of others within Lamepla's department unprofessional, but not criminal, The Blade reported. 

She wrote: 'The professionalism of the Put-in-Bay Police Department often fell far short of what should be expected.

'However, it is not a crime to be unprofessional.

'There appeared to be a pattern of inconsistency in the enforcement of the laws at Put-in-Bay and disparate treatment of individuals.'

The  department has a small year-round staff but hires a number of seasonal officers to deal with the busy summer tourist season. 

Put-in-Bay, which has close to 500 residents, is one of about 20 islands located in the western end of Lake Erie

According to the department website: 'Put-in-Bay is a summer resort, and has been for over 100 years. 

'Today, Put-in-Bay is a vibrant tourist resort complete with taverns, gift shops, hotels, boating, fishing, a national monument, caves and other island attractions. 

'Under the command of Chief Robert Lampela, the police department has progressed into a department that the community can count on.' 

The department advises visitors 'what you might think is fun now, may be costly later' and 'use common sense, don't do something here that you would not do at home.'

Lampela's Facebook page contains numerous postings from someone named Bruce Kroger.

It has been alleged that Kroger was actually created by Lampela.

In a post from August 2014 that appears on Lampela's page, Kroger wrote: 'This guy Mark Mathys has been quoted in the Sandusky newspaper that the police are corrupt. 

'Well, a simple google search found a recent arrest of his in FL. 

'How dirty is the pool he's swimming in? Of course criminals will think the police are corrupt.'
