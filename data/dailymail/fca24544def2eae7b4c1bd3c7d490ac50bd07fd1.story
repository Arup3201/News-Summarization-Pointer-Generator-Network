From a family of lions at rest in Gabon to a pair of young children trampolining in the Brazilian favelas, these incredible images are among the winners and finalists of a prestigious competition showcasing the very best in photography from around the world.

The stunning pictures were taken by the winning and shortlisted artists competing in the Sony World Photography Awards, and were whittled down from more than 139,000 entries from 166 countries - the highest total in the awards' seven-year history.

Among the pieces, which were all taken over the past year, are photographs detailing all manner of subjects, from poignant images of domestic abuse, to a tender moment between a father and his young daughter.

Works by British photographers among the finalists include the dramatic post-race 
portraits of jockeys by Spencer Murphy and stunning still life photography 
by Bristol-based photographer Amanda Harman.

The images will go on display at a special exhibition which opens to the public today at Somerset House in London and also features work taken over the past 40 years by Mary Ellen Mark, who was honoured for her outstanding contribution to photography at the awards ceremony last night.
