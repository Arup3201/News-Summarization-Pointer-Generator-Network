Both men, also believed to be from Fairfield, are assisting police with their inquiries and said they were forced to restrain Mr Dark after he became violent. 

The two men then left Mr Dark near the beach before seeking medical treatment at Canterbury hospital for head injuries suffered during the altercation.

It was soon after the pair contacted police about the incident they found Mr Dark's body in the remote location.

Detective Inspector Tim Beattie from Wollongong police station said Mr Dark was not tied to anything when he was found.

'There was an altercation which ultimately resulted in the death of Mr Dark,' Detective Inspector Beattie told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was held to the ground and restrained behind his back.'

Detectives have questioned the two men but they have both been released without charge and police investigations will continue. They are still assisting police with their inquiries.
