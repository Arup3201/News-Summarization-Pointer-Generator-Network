Glamour model turned bodybuilder Jodie Marsh who received up to five vile letters and pictures a week from her 'stalker' Joseph Mafwenke.

Jodie Marsh was left fearing for her life after a deluded stalker bombarded her with bizarre letters and pictures of his penis, a court was told.

Joseph Mafwenke, 38, allegedly sent up to five 'disgusting' letters a week to the glamour model turned bodybuilder's home address in Brentwood, Essex.

Mafwenke’s bizarre campaign included sending Miss Marsh, 35, photoshopped pictures of the couple having intercourse and of them walking hand in hand.

Miss Marsh told Basildon Crown Court the  'stalking' was so relentless, she feared she could have been kidnapped, raped or even murdered.

Mafwenke would send up to five letters and pictures every week - some by recorded delivery - for almost a year, jurors were told.

Miss Marsh eventually moved house to escape the man's relentless campaign.

Mafwenke was arrested when the television personality saw him standing outside her old house when she returned to visit family.

Miss Marsh told the court she recognised her alleged stalker - who also told Miss Marsh he wanted to have four children with her - from the photos he had sent.

Mafwenke, of Crawley, West Sussex, has denied a single charge of stalking Miss Marsh.

Mafwenke sat in the dock alongside his Swahili interpreter as the court was told a Zoo magazine article featuring Miss Marsh had inspired his actions.

Miss Marsh took to the witness stand to give evidence from behind screens so she would not have to face the defendant.

At one point she broke down in tears as she was confronted with the letters

She said: 'Straight away, I knew it was not normal fan mail, the letters would say things like "you will be my wife", "we will be together", "you will have four children", "we are meant to be together".

'The way it was said, it was like it was a given that it would happen.'

Miss Marsh said the letters, which included pictures of a naked Mafwenke on top of her, left her 'really scared'.

Miss Marsh said she 'feared for her life' when she received the letters - some of which had been photoshopped to show her having sex with Mafwenke. The man also sent her pictures of his penis, jurors heard

The former glamour model, who is now a bodybuilder, said she initially told police not to take any action in case it 'tipped Mafwenke over the edge.' He would send up to five letters a week to Miss Marsh the court heard

She had also been sent 'weird drawings' in which her name and that of the defendant had been intertwined.

The court heard Mafwenke also made 'calculations' using his date of birth and Miss Marsh’s to work out whether they would be happy together.

She added: 'He would send photos of himself, at first he was fully clothed then the photos turned explicit and he sent pictures of himself naked and photos of his penis and erect penis.

'That was really upsetting. It was really disgusting - not something that I would want to see.

'I was left nervous, thinking about what he might do in the future I was worried that he was mentally unstable'

She told jurors she had initially asked police not to take any action in case it tipped Mafwenke over the edge.

Asked by prosecutor Julia Faure Walker what she feared could happen, Miss Marsh said: 'I thought it might be rape, murder, kidnap. In my line of work, you don’t think anything is too far-fetched.'

The court heard the frequency of letters increased to up to five per week with the mail being sent by recorded delivery.

One letter said: 'I love you and the way you are alone..I plan to have four babies with you in married life. Thank you for I make it happen. [sic]

Another said: 'Our time is now to have our childrens'. [sic]

Talking about the letters, Miss Marsh said: 'I honestly thought he was deluded. I did not think he was mentally stable.'

The glamour model turned bodybuilder said she felt obliged to go and collect missed letters from the sorting office in case they were work-related documents.

Miss Faure Walker asked her: 'Did you ever respond in any way to these letters?

Miss Marsh replied: 'No. I knew it was not right to respond.'

Some of the letters were thrown away but many were kept as evidence and were seen by the jury.

Miss Faure Walker told the jury that Mafwenke’s 'fascination' with Miss Marsh began after he saw an article in Zoo magazine.

She said: 'He was responding to an article in Zoo magazine. He interpreted it that Miss Marsh wanted a boyfriend and he would contact her to that end.'

In August 2012 she started receiving the first of the letters and 'felt troubled' by their content.

'This
 was not ordinary fan mail. There were photos of himself and sometimes 
he superimposed pictures of himself next to Miss Marsh as well. He then started sending photos of his erect penis to her.

'Initially, the defendant would send normal letters by post but then he started sending them by recorded delivery.'

Miss Faure Walker warned the jurors that they would be seeing sexually explicit images.

She added: 'There are photos of the defendant’s penis which he took it upon himself to send to her.

When questioned in court Miss Marsh, pictured in training, said she never responded to any of the messages

'You may want to think what your reaction would have been if you had not been warned of the content.

'How would you feel if they had been sent to your home address?'

She said the defendant should have known his course of conduct would cause harassment or distress.

The trial heard that Miss Marsh did report the matters to police - but asked them just to place her concerns on record and not to approach Mafwenke, fearful of how he would react.

Mafwenke, who appeared in the dock wearing a black and white striped shirt and grey trousers, pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing to stalking Miss Marsh.

The trial, expected to last two days, continues.
