What are United getting for their money?

Someone who knows how to get a team into the Champions League. He did it last season at Athletic Bilbao and they will be confident he can do it again.

So he is a leader?

He has the character that a club looking to rebuild will need. He’s honest, fiercely committed and loyal. There was evidence of that last season when United moved too late in the transfer window to get him and the only way the deal was going to happen is if he forced his way out of Athletic Bilbao.

Ed Woodward gambled on Athletic lowering their buy-out clause – something that he should have known they never do – and only if Herrera had put in a transfer request and started a war was the deal going to go through.

Out of respect to Athletic he wouldn’t do it. He wanted to go to United but he wanted the transfer to be done properly.

And when it didn’t happen he didn’t sulk he got down to the business of helping Athletic Bilbao qualify for the Champions League. That’s the kind of man he is.

3. £29.3m - Rio Ferdinand from Leeds United in July 2002

4. £28.1m - Juan Sebastian Veron from Lazio in July 2001

5. £27.5m - Marouane Fellaini from Everton in September 2013

And he was successful?

He was and it wasn’t isn’t easy. Because of the rise of Atletico Madrid there was only one place up for grabs and Athletic beat Valencia, Sevilla and Real Sociedad to the punch largely thanks to Herrera’s leadership and his five goals and five assists from midfield.

Where did he play?

He usually operated in a midfield three slightly ahead of two holding players but United fans need not be concerned that they have bought another number 10 because he can comfortably operate slightly deeper, building the play. He has the vision and the passing for the role and he’s also tough.

Can he help make Old Trafford a fortress again?

Athletic Bilbao went until mid-february last season without losing at home. Barcelona turned up in November on a roll and were rolled out of town empty handed. Both Andres Iniesta and Xavi were taken off and Herrera was one of the best players on the pitch. Real Madrid also failed to win there.

How will he fit in?

There is a Juan Mata connection that United fans should be excited about. The two played together when Spain won the U-21 Euros in Denmark in 2011.

Ander scored the all-important first goal with a header and helped mesmerize the Swiss opposition in the Aarhus Stadium linking brilliantly with Thiago Alcantara and with Mata.

Why hasn’t he stepped up?

He has had to wait for the changing of the guard. With Xavi and Xabi on their way out the path opens up for Ander. Vicente del Bosque spoke after the win over Australia about the future being bright – Herrera, along with Bayern Munich’s Thiago and Atletico Madrid’s Koke, is one of the reasons why. 

But Koke went to the World Cup and Thiago would have gone had he not got injured so are United getting the 3rd best option?

There is no shame being left out of Spain’s squad of midfielders. Real Madrid spent 30m euros on Asier Illaramendi last summer and he’s nowhere near the squad. Ander will be far better value than Illaramendi. He can defend, the can attack, he keeps the ball, and he wins it back when it’s been lost.

He’s a slow burner, but that often beats an overnight sensation. He’s had to work hard to get recognition at unfashionable Zaragoza. Athletic Bilbao wanted him as a kid but he stayed loyal to Zaragoza. Eventually they got him, for 8m back in 2011. Then it was their turn to fight to hold on to him. Now they have lost that battle and he’s a United player.

Van Gaal will approve?

You don’t think United dare sign him without Van Gaal’s approval? The Dutchman had a reputation at Bayern Munich for being offered players by directors Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinze Rummenigge and telling them ‘no’, ‘no’, ‘no’. He will have said yes to Herrera and he will have said yes for a reason – he’s a midfield soldier, with the flair to find the passes that will release Mata, Rooney and Van Persie and with the stomach for a Premier League battle.
