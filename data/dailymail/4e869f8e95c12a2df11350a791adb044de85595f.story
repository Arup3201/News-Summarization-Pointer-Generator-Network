A 14-year-old Florida boy who was given a slim chance of survival after he was crushed under a bus two months ago has made a miraculous recovery.

Jerry Cunningham, from Pompano Beach, was running to hold a Broward County bus for his mother on May 10 when his arm got stuck in the door and the distracted driver dragged him along the road and then pulled him under the vehicle, which weighed 20-tons.

The shocking incident, which was captured on surveillance video, left the eighth grader with fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and he was put in a medically induced coma. Doctors gave him a slim chance of survival. But, after two months in hospital, Cunningham is going home today.

'I always say my son is a miracle because he's alive and nobody knows how,' his father, Gerard Cunningham, said, according to the Miami Herald.

The teen was rushed to Broward Health Medical center after the horrific accident. Cunningham said his prognosis was grim when he arrived.

The next few days would be critical for the 14-year-old.

'After the fifth day he woke up. He opened his eyes,' his father said. 'That day the doctor said it's a 50-50 chance. So we've been waiting day by day.'

On June 13, Jerry was transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital.

'On the second day that I was here, he called me Dad. On the second day he called Mom, Dad, so he started talking and I saw him, he walks, he laughs,' Cunningham said.

Jerry suffered a severe traumatic brain 
injury and the damage to his left leg meant he couldn't put weight on. 
He had to be fed through a tube.

'He didn't know where he was, who he was, what was going on. He didn't know anything,' said Seema Khurana, director of pediatric rehabilitation at Jackson, according to the Miami Herald.

After a week at Jackson, the teen was sleeping, answering some questions and had put weight on his foot. He was improving every day.

'He is a miracle,' she told the Sun Sentinel, adding that his parents have been at Jerry's bedside and at his therapies sessions every day, which has made a big difference.

Cunningham makes his son a special breakfast every morning and quizzes him on the menu to help with his memory.

'That's part of the therapy. They do their part and I do mine,' Cunningham said.

When he gets home, Jerry will begin 
stage two of his recovery as an outpatient. This involves three sessions
of therapy a week and lessons with a teacher.

He has already learned to walk again by himself, though he's still shaky and requires supervision.

'He's like a baby,' his father said. 'He's not a 14-year-old boy, but rather a baby that has to learn everything again.'

His
memory, however, is the biggest deficit, speech pathologist Jennifer 
Rey said. She said he was able to remember things right away, but 
forgets after a few seconds. But his long-term memory remains intact and
doctors are hopeful his retention will improve.

Jerry's
father became overcome at a press conference at the hospital on 
Wednesday and thanked the medical teams who saved his son's life.

'The therapists and these people are miracle workers,' he said, almost in tears, 'excellent.'

The shocking video captured the heartbreaking moment Jerry was run over by a 20-ton bus.

In
the footage, the teen is seen sprinting to stop the bus as the vehicle 
begins to move away from the curb.

But the boy's arm gets caught in the 
automatic doors, and the driver, who is distracted chatting to other 
passengers, drags him along the road for a number of seconds and then 
underneath the bus.

According to the Sun Sentinel, the
tragedy took place at around 9 a.m. on May 10 in front of scores of 
horrified passengers, and was filmed by the Broward County Transit bus's
security cameras, which cover eight angles.

Two
of the angles captured the young boy as he gallantly ran towards the 
bus for his mother.

After he gets his arm caught, he is seen sprinting 
for some seven seconds to keep up with the bus while banging on the door
for attention with his other arm. He then disappears out of sight.

Horror: After the bus stops, the passengers and the driver get out to help the boy before calling 911

One woman can be seen and heard on 
the tape telling the diver, Reinaldo Soto, 55, that someone was running 
for the bus then several people yell at him to stop because the boy's 
arm was shut in the door.

When he slips out of sight, several passengers scream and one woman is seen hitting Soto as the bus stopped.

The driver and a group of passengers 
then rushed off the bus to help the boy with his mother who, by that 
point, had caught up with the bus.

Soto is seen rushing back to his radio to call for help.

Cunningham suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and is in the pediatric care unit at Broward Health Medical Center, his family's attorney Elie Anidjar told the Sun Sentinel.

Last month, transit officials said bus driver Reinaldo Soto, 55, a 12-year veteran with the Transit authority, would be suspended without pay for 15 days and demoted from bus operator to coach service attendant to clean and service buses, the Sun Sentinel reported.
