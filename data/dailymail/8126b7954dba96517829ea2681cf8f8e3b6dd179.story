A mother fatally shot her wheelchair-bound teenage daughter before turning the gun on herself in an alleged murder-suicide at their house on this road in Bonney Lake, Washington, on Friday 

Patsy Warner, a neighbour, said that she often heard the two arguing in the garden when the school bus arrived but could not believe what had happened. 

'I can't comprehend it. I just can't,' she told King 5 News.   

'Even though she was a handful, I'm sure, I can't comprehend that.'

Ed Troyer, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman, said that although the police investigation was ongoing a murder-suicide was likely. 

He said: 'There's nothing to tell us any different at this point.' 

The mother and daughter's names have not been released officially - but counsellors will be available for students and staff at the nearby Bonney Lake High School.
