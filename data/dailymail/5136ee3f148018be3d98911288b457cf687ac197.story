Jacqueline Coltman, 42, has been cleared of attacking six guests during a fight after her friend's funeral

A woman was today cleared of attacking five mourners at a drunken wake after telling a jury she was acting in self defence.

Jacqueline Coltman, 42, said she had been dragged into a pile of bodies when fellow mourners began brawling outside an Exeter pub.

She was found not guilty of a series of assaults after insisting she had only struck out at people in order to escape from the crowd and avoid trouble.

Ms Coltman did admit pulling one girl to the floor by her hair after mistaking her for another woman, and accepted a police caution.

The violence flared up after family 
and friends of Selina Nicholas attended her funeral at Exeter Crematorium 
in December 2012 and a wake at the Windsor Castle pub in Heavitree.

The prosecution alleged Ms Coltman launched herself at 
the dead woman’s sister Mrs Owen, knocking her to the ground and 
breaking her collar bone.

Ms Coltman was also alleged to have punched a child in the chest, then bitten or scratched the other mourners during the ensuing brawl.

However Ms Coltman claimed she had been made the 
scapegoat for a series of brawls which spread through the car park 
behind the pub and allegedly involved up to 20 people.

Ms Coltman, of West End, 
Minchinghampton, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, denied causing grievous 
bodily harm to one guest, actual bodily harm to a 16-year-old mourner 
and battery against three others.

The fight broke out at this pub at Selina Nicholas's wke but a jury found Ms Coltman was not responsible

Wake: The drunken brawl occurred after the funeral of Selina Nicholas (pictured left and right). At an inquest into her death, the coroner was told the mother-of-seven died after getting addicted to a powerful legal high

She told the jury she had been 
reluctant to go to the funeral because she was worried a long standing 
argument with one of the mourners may flare up.

She added that she had drunk a shandy and 
three lagers and had got into an argument. She had then pulled the hair 
of what she thought was a woman but was in fact a girl.

She said: 'I grabbed her hair and 
pulled her to the floor. I knew straight away it was not her. I told her
 I was so sorry. I felt really bad.

'Someone jumped on my back and we ended up on the floor. We started fighting. I just remember being at the bottom of the pile.

'I don’t accept I beat up five to six 
people including a bloke. They were all on top of me. I was hitting out 
to get them off. They were all drunk. Half of them don’t know what went 
on but blamed me for it.'

Legal highs: Selina Nicholas, pictured, was found dead by one of her sons in 2012. Coroner Elizabeth Earland recorded an open verdict but said she could not establish for certain that legal highs had caused Selina's death

The alleged victims included the dead 
woman’s sister Chiquita Owen, who suffered a broken shoulder, and 
daughter Alarissa Nicholas, who was left with cuts and bruises.

The jury took less than an hour to 
clear her of all charges and there was applause and shouts of ‘Justice is 
served’ from supporters in the public gallery.

An inquest heard later that Selina Nicholas’s death was linked to the use of a powerful legal high.
