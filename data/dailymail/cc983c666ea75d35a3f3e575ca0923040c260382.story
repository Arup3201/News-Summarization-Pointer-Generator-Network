Minneapolis police are investigating a shooting inside a popular downtown nightclub that injured 9 people, including Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Linval Joseph.

The team released a statement Saturday saying Joseph, 25, was struck by a bullet in the calf. He was treated for a minor injury and released.

The Vikings described Joseph, a former member of the New York Giants team, as an innocent bystander in the shooting that broke out inside the club 400 SoundBar.

Police spokesman Scott Seroka says two people with serious injuries were in stable condition Saturday and expected to survive.

He didn't know the exact condition of the other seven but described most as having minor injuries.

Club owner Johann Sfaellos told the Minneapolis Star Tribune it was a typical night with patrons busy socializing and dancing to live music, with no fights until he heard gunshots at around 1.40am.

After squeezing off several rounds into the crowd, sending terrified patrons ducking for cover, the shooter dropped the gun to the floor and fled.

Police revealed today that the incident was gang-related, with the unidentified gunman targeting one of the victims.

Mayor Betsy Hodges said at the request of the city SoundBar has been shut down indefinitely.

Meanwhile, the injured NFL player is recovering at home and is expected to rejoin his team next week.

Joseph signed a five-year, $31.25million contract with the Vikings in March after playing four seasons with the Giants.

Police are still looking for the shooter. Seroka expected more information to be released Monday.
