A teenage girl who was tricked into having sex with a woman who pretended to be a schoolboy today spoke of her outrage after learning her abuser had avoided prison.

Christine Wilson, 26, seduced two 15-year-olds - but a judge ruled that she deserved a lenient sentence because she genuinely believed that she was in fact male.

One of the victims, Megan Adie, said she was 'devastated' by the judgement, and warned that Wilson could prey on others now that she is walking free.

She was given three months of probation as well of community service during sentencing at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Fury: Megan Adie is outraged after 26-year-old Christine Wilson escaped jail for tricking her into sex by pretending to be a teenage boy

Megan, now 18, regarded Wilson as her 'first love' when they met, and allow the person she thought was a 16-year-old boy to take her virginity.

The victim, who has waived her right to anonymity in order to speak out, today said: 'I'm absolutely devastated with the sentence Christine has been given.

'She will be able to go back to her own house and lie in her own bed again. I will also be lying in mine, still trying to deal with what she has done to me.

'I really hope the judge has really thought this sentence through because if Christine does this again, I hope he knows it's on his conscience.'

Walking free: Christine Wilson, pictured outside court today, has been sentenced to probation for obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud

Wilson, from Aberdeen, had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud.

In 2008, she posed as a 17-year-old boy named Chris and had sexual relations with a teenage girl.

'The complainer believed Wilson to be a 
boy aged 17 years old,' a lawyer said at a previous hearing. 'There was sexual contact - initially, kissing and
 cuddling but things progressed over the course of the three months.'

The girl broke off contact with Wilson after seeing her passport, which was emailed to her by another girl.

When Wilson was later interviewed by police, she admitted having a relationship with the girl and 
presenting herself as a boy throughout, and accepted that she did not 
allow the girl to do anything to her that might disclose her gender.

In 2010, the defendant started a relationship with Megan, using a sex toy to persuade her she was a boy aged 16.

‘This was the complainer’s first 
experience of what she thought had been sexual intercourse and both 
declared their love for each other,' the lawyer said. 'The complainer felt having had sex 
with the accused made their relationship stronger.

‘The
 complainer had what she believed to be sexual intercourse on one 
further conviction. Again this intimacy was described to be under the 
covers so they did not see each other naked.’

Megan was devastated to be told by police that her 'boyfriend' was actually an older woman.

The court heard today that
 the 26-year-old suffers from gender identity disorder, causing her to 
feel that she was born in the wrong body.

Fraud: She was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh, but the judge expressed sympathy with her

'These are very unusual offences,' Lord Bannatyne said during sentencing. 'The case is clearly an exceptional one.'

On
 Wilson's disorder, he said: 'I accept that this leads you to genuinely 
feel you are male rather than female. This significantly lowers your 
culpability.'

The judge 
added that although the offences were serious, 'having had regard to all
 the circumstances I believe they can be dealt with by an non-custodial 
sentence'.

Lord Bannatyne acknowledged that there was no violence involved in the offences.

He also accepted that Wilson had not dressed as a boy solely to seduce the young girls, as she always wears masculine clothing.

Wilson was sentenced to a three-year probation order with an additional 240 hours' community service.

The Scottish Transgender Alliance argued that people should not be prosecuted for concealing their gender.

A spokesman said that criminalising gender fraud threatened the privacy of transgendered people and 'seriously undermined trans people's trust in the Scottish criminal justice system'.

Nathan Gale, an STA development worker, said: 'We understand that some people may be distressed when they become aware of the trans status of a partner or former partner.

'But just in the same way that people aren't obliged to share other personal information with potential partners, for example that they are married or have criminal convictions, trans people shouldn't be forced to share private information about their gender history under fear of prosecution.'
