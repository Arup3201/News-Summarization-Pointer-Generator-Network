Travelling Galatasaray fans caused chaos by lighting up the Emirates with flares during their Champions League clash on Wednesday, but the trouble started well before they reached the stadium.

Thousands of Turkish fans walked to the ground accompanied by a police escort, although that did not stop them letting of flares under a bridge near Finsbury Park and throwing the flaming missiles into a local pub frequented by Arsenal fans.

Camera phone footage shows the frenzied supporters marching past The Tollington Arms in Holloway and launching several flares that burst into flames at the pub's entrance, narrowly missing some of the patrons before being stamped out as both sets of fans goad each other.

Sportsmail understands that Galatasaray fans were issued 3,000 tickets and although 12 flares were confiscated at the turnstiles, fans still managed to smuggle more into the ground - causing a disturbance when they were thrown on to the pitch during  the first half of Arsenal’s 4-1 win..

A fire steward was hit by a flare and  Arsenal fans were reportedly pelted with coins and bottles, while over 100 seats at the stadium were damaged.

Riot police were ordered into position in front of Galatasaray fans after flares were hurled on to the  pitch. Several flares were thrown on after defender Felipe Melo had put in a two-footed lunge on Alexis Sanchez in the 36th minute. The Gunners led 2-0 at the time following two goals from Danny Welbeck.

Both clubs could face sanctions as a result, with UEFA confirming it may take action after considering the report of its match delegate.

Goalkeeper Fernando Muslera collected the flares and dropped them on the sidelines, at which point helmeted riot police and stewards filed along the advertising hoardings.

Firecrackers had also been let off by Galatasaray's travelling contingent, who were stunned into silence when Sanchez fired the Gunners into a 3-0 lead with four minutes of the half remaining.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed there had been six arrests, two of which were for entering the ground with flares.
