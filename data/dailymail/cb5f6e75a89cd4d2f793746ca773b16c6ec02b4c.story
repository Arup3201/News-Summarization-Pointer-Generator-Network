An archivist has unearthed a long-lost letter written to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 by a London stockbroker asking the United States to help Czech children escape the Nazis.

Nicholas Winton, who ended up saving 669 children - many of them Jewish - on the eve of World War II, later received a letter saying that U.S. immigration laws meant that nothing could be done.

Winton, now 104, mentioned the letter in an interview with CBS 60 Minutes and when it aired, David Langbart, an archivist at the National Archives and Records Administration, went searching for the note, which had not been seen in 75 years.

'And lo and behold, I came up with his original letter to President Roosevelt,' Langbart told CBS.

Hero: Nicholas Winton, now 104, helped 669 children escape Nazi Europe on the eve of World War II. In 1939 he sent a letter to President Roosevelt asking for help but the U.S. responded that it could not

Found: A letter dated 1939 and written to President Franklin D. Roosevelt has been found in the National Archives. It asks the U.S. for help granting refuge to European children

Plea: It is signed by Winton - then a young London stockbroker who made it his mission to save children

The letter, which is dated May 16th, 1939, writes to President Roosevelt, calling him 'Esteemed Sir'.

'Perhaps
 people in America do not realize how little is being and has been done 
for refugee children in Czechoslovakia,' the letter says.

'Is it 
possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in 
America?... It is hard to state our case forcibly in a letter, but we 
trust to your imagination to realize how desperately urgent the 
situation is.'

The
 archives also revealed internal letters about the request. They show 
that the Department of State was asked for action before it was sent to 
the President's Advisory Committee on Political Refugees.

Discovery: Archivist David Langbart looked for the letter after seeing Winton's story on CBS

Questions: Archives show that the letter was passed on to U.S. officials for a decision on what to do

Inquiries: The archivist found a letter to the President's Advisory Committee on Political Refugees

But ultimately, Winton received a letter that the U.S. was 'unable, in the absence of specific 
legislation, to permit immigration in excess of that provided for by 
existing immigration laws'.

Unassuming: Winton was 29 when he went to Prague and made a list of children to be saved

Speaking on CBS, Winton said: 'The Americans wouldn't take any [children], which was a pity. We could've got a lot more out.'

But he still helped 669 children escape from certain death - a heroic feat 
that he kept quiet for decades. And he said that he didn't loiter on the
 response from the U.S.

'We had not much time for negative attitudes,' he explained.

It was 1938 and violence was escalating against Jewish people in Europe when Winton, then just 29, traveled to Prague on his work vacation.

As
 the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia, Winton - who had no experience 
or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would see if he could save people.

He
 had actually booked a vacation to go skiing in Switzerland, but changed
 his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in Jewish refugee 
work asked him for help.

'All
 I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out,' Winton, who 
was born to German Jewish parents in London, told CBS' 60 Minutes in a 
special interview.

'And
 they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out... I 
work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a 
way of doing it.'

He set up shop in the city and people soon started coming to him, forcing him to work late into the night, historian David Silberklang told CBS.

Rescuer: Winton, pictured in Prague in 1938 with a young boy, kept his involvement quiet for 50 years

Esteemed Sir,

Perhaps people in America do not realize how little is being and has been done for refugee children in Czechoslovakia. They have to depend entirely on private guarantors to get into England, which means that somebody has to take full responsibility for maintenance, upkeep, and education, until they are 18 years of age. No other country is taking an interest in them except for Sweden, which took 35 children last February. We at this office have case-papers and photos of over 5000 children, quite apart from a further 10,000 whom we estimate have to register. Actually, so far, we have brought only about 120 into England.

In Bohemia and Slovakia today, there are thousands of children, some homeless and starving, mostly without nationality, but they certainly all have one thing in common: there is no future, if they are forced to remain where they are. Their parents are forbidden work and the children are forbidden schooling, and apart from the physical discomforts, which all this signifies, the moral degradation is immeasurable. Yet since Munich, hardly anything has been done for the children in Czechoslovakia. Many of the children are quite destitute having had to move more than once since they originally fled from Germany.

Is it possible for anything to be done to help us with this problem in America? It is hard to state our case forcibly in a letter, but we trust to your imagination to realize how desperately urgent the situation is.

Believe me, Esteemed Sir, with many thanks,

Your obedient Servant,

Nicholas Winton.

When he 
returned to London, he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task
 convincing the British authorities to take them.

He
 pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an 
established refugee organization, adding 'Children's Section' to its 
header and making himself chairman, CBS reported.

He
 admitted it took 'a little smoke and mirrors' to convince authorities 
to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to 
print the paper.

He
 continued his work as a stockbroker by day, before returning to the 
office to work on getting the children to the UK. His mother and 
volunteers also helped at the office.

He said he contacted American authorities to take the children, but they said they were unable.

But
 British authorities said they would take them if Winton found each one a
 home, so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families 
would take them.

When
 he had secured them homes, the youngsters were ready to leave - but he 
found that the British authorities were slow to issue their travel 
documents.

Desperate to help the children get out, he forged their documents and also paid off officials, he said.

'Took a bit of blackmail on my part,' he admitted. 'It worked. That's the main thing.'

The first children left Prague on March 14, 1939 - just hours before German troops occupied Prague.

Eventually, seven trains carried more than 600 children to Holland, where they caught ferries to England. The Nazis allowed them to leave, happy that the country was being 'cleansed' of Jews.

Another train was scheduled to leave on September 1, but was stopped by the declaration of war.

Winton said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived.

One of the children who did escape, Hugo Meisl, recounted the moment he was put on a train by his parents.

Saved: Among the children saved were 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, left, and 10-year-old Hugo Meisl, right

Thankful: Alice, who now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, said she only heard Winton's name after 50 years

Survivor: Meisl said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents

'I remember that they told us that we were going to England maybe two or three months,' he said. 'It would be a holiday for us. And that they would join us very shortly thereafter...'

But his parents never came for him, and their names are now painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkas Synagogue, where every Czech Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust is remembered.

Also among the children was 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, now 88 and living in Bethesda, Maryland.

She recounted her mother handing her items, including a delicate, embroidered nightgown, to take on the train when she left for England. She never saw her parents again.

'Many survivors feel guilty for having 
survived - I feel very grateful to my parents,' she said. 'Our parents' courage, I think, is the most 
important because most people said, "We will go together or not at 
all".'

After the war, Winton trained pilots for 
the Royal Air Force, married, raised a family and lived comfortably. He 
cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly.

Recognized: He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2002 (pictured) and has been the subject of a film. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father

But he hardly told anyone about what he had done.

'I didn't really keep it secret,' he told CBS. 'I just didn't talk about it.'

But in 1988, his wife Grete found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children, their parents and the families that had taken them.

Later that year, the BBC learned about the story and he went on a show, where he met scores of the children he had saved.

In 2002, he was knighted, and he was also celebrated in a documentary called 'Nicky's Family'. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father.

But he doesn't care for the attention.

'I'm not interested in the past,' he said. 'I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened. And nobody is concentrated on the present and the future.'
