Sam Allardyce insists he is not nearing the exit at West Ham and that his link with the Sunderland job for next season is nothing more than speculation.

Dick Advocaat took over from sacked manager Gus Poyet at the Stadium of Light on Tuesday until the end of the season, and the 67-year-old’s first-ever Barclays Premier League match will be against the man tipped to replace him.

Allardyce’s future remains uncertain under co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan with his contract expiring at the end of the season.

Allardyce is well thought of at Sunderland, who hired Dick Advocaat on a short-term deal this week 

Big Sam goes into Saturday's game with Sunderland having not won in the Premier League since January 18 against Hull City, and the 60-year-old refused to discuss his future beyond his current contract.

‘Pure speculation,’ Allardyce said. ‘I’m West Ham manager. I’m professional. I’ m contracted to West Ham, and don’t expect anything other than that somewhere along the line we will be talking about a contract here.’

It was in May that Allardyce was told to play more attractive football, but the manager admitted he is now more bothered on simply winning points after picking up just eight in 2015.

West Ham will have to do so without defender James Tomkins, who was confirmed as being out for the remainder of the season following surgery on a dislocated shoulder suffered in training.

‘The bottom line to that is playing fantastic is great, but not winning is crucial. It’s critical,’ Allardyce continued.

‘We have big problems in winning a football match at the moment. Not the performance. The ultimate is our goal is to win football matches. Not to play well and not win.

‘That’s what we’ve been doing recently, and we’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to make sure the most important thing for Saturday is to gain a victory. Hopefully we can do that in style but if we can’t play as well as we have been doing, just make sure we win this game.’
