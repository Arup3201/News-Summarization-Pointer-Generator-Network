A former soldier has been jailed after police found a rocket launcher hidden under his bed while they were raiding a cannabis factory in his flat.

Mark Chalcroft served in the Territorial Army for 12 years, and kept the weapon capable of destroying tanks 'as a kind of souvenir', Northampton Crown Court heard.

He claimed he believed that it had been deactivated and was no longer dangerous, but a judge said it could in fact have been lethal 'if it fell into the wrong hands'.

Lethal: This rocket launcher capable of blowing up a tank was found under the bed of ex-soldier Mark Chalcroft

Police visited Chalcroft's one-bedroom flat in Northampton after smelling cannabis during an investigation of an unrelated incident in the building.

They discovered a marijuana factory with 28 cannabis plants - and were stunned to come across a 3ft rocket launcher hidden under the military enthusiast's bed.

The L1A3B1 weapon was still capable of firing destructive missiles, even though it had a stamp certifying that it was deactivated.

Chalcroft, 46, was arrested and charged with cannabis cultivation and possession of a rocket launcher.

Last week he pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.

Sentence: Chalcroft was handed a two-year jail sentence by a judge at Northampton Crown Court

Judge John Bray told him: 'This is a serious weapon, which could have very serious consequences if it fell into the wrong hands.

'I accept your basis of plea, that you purchased the weapon as a kind of souvenir and never intended to use it.

'It has a deactivation stamp on it, which suggests it could not be fired.

'But as a former member of the Territorial Army you should have checked if this was a potentially dangerous weapon or not.'

No rockets or ammunition were found at the flat.

The L1A3B1 is the British version of the M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon used by the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War and based on the design of the Bazooka.

It is operated by a single soldier and is capable of destroying tanks and other buildings at a range of 200m.

It is unclear how Chalcroft acquired the active weapon, although deactivated versions of the rocket launcher are widely available online for less than Â£100.

Rebecca Wade, prosecuting, said: 'There was a stamp on it, which would indicate deactivation, but experts said that hadn't taken place.

'He [the expert] said it was still capable of firing rockets, although there was nothing found within the property that could have been used to do so.'

Defending Matthew Lowe said Chalcroft 'genuinely and honestly believed the weapon had been deactivated'.

He added: 'This is a man who had been in the Territorial Army for some 12 years and had something of a fascination with all things weaponry, and as a memento or a souvenir he purchased it.'
