Another weekend and more discussions and dissatisfaction with officiating.

At Old Trafford I could actually understand how Roger East thought that Wes Brown had clipped Radamel Falcao but the clear and obvious foul was clearly by John O'Shea. East was right to award the penalty kick. What mystified me was that the PGMO decided, unusually, to issue a statement regarding the incident, perhaps in an attempt to support one of their officials.

East's statement, in which he felt Brown had made the foul for the penalty, makes it impossible for the FA to transfer the red card to O'Shea as they can only do so when the referee accepts that he has disciplined the wrong player.

Now the red card will be issued to Brown, although he has appealed it as he did not foul Falcao. Had no statement been made then the card could have been transferred and natural justice could have taken place - even when referees get decisions right there appears to be a mess-up.

Nothing is certain, however, in the discredited disciplinary process following the Ashley Barnes and Nemanja Matic incident. Barnes could not be charged for a clearly and widely accepted red card challenge while a player guilty of violent conduct, according to the FA, had a reduced ban for some bizarre reason. Either he was guilty or not.

Another example is that Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak should be charged for his clearly deliberate forearm smash on West Ham's Diafra Sakho towards the end of Palace's win at Upton Park. It appeared to be unseen by referee Mike Dean but was around the area of active play, where the ball was present, so could that be deemed as 're-refereeing' an incident? I hope not as the Australian certainly deserves a ban for the mindless assault.

There was more dissatisfaction, and this time by both mangers over the performance of referee Neil Swarbrick at The Britannia Stadium. There were three key incidents although both Steve Bruce and Mark Hughes seemed less than happy with the general refereeing.

Two acts of serious foul play escaped Swarbrick's detection and Stephen Ireland was involved in both. First he went into a challenge with David Meyler leading with a sideways, stamping studs first boot which could have caused a really nasty injury – it certainly endangered his opponents safety and should have led to a red card.

Just ten minutes later it appeared that Hull's Maynor Figueroa decided to take the law into his own hands and went through Ireland from behind, raking straight down the back of the Stoke midfielder's calf and causing a nasty injury. Another red card tackle which didn't even merit yellow for Swarbrick. Perhaps the FA will act or maybe they'll say they cannot.

The fact that the only goal of the game came from Peter Crouch who was in an offside position led to more understandable frustration. Unfortunately the video replays that the game needs to correct such errors was turned down by the IFAB at their meeting this weekend.
