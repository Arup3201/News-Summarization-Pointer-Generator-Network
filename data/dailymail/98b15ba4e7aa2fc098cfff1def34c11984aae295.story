Days after Romeo Beckham made his modelling debut for Burberry, the Beckhams have been voted the most fashionable celebrity family.

And with half of the family already taking the fashion world by storm and the youngest of the brood topping 'most fashionable baby' polls, it comes as no surprise that the famous six were way out in front with almost one third of the overall votes.

Voters said David, fashion designer 
Victoria, Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz and the youngest member of the family, 
Harper Seven, always looked immaculately dressed and were known for 
setting, rather than following the latest trends.

Most stylish: The Beckham clan were voted as the most stylish celebrity family

Good genes: Harper Seven and Romeo have both inherited their parent's good looks and regularly top 'most stylish child' polls

The Kardashian sisters came in second with 14 per cent of the votes due to their bold and individual styles with the Jolie Pitt family coming third with 13 per cent of the vote.

Beyoncé, Jay-Z and their daughter Blue Ivy polled fourth thanks to their love of designer brands, with Middleton sisters Kate and Pippa coming fifth.

Saturday’s singer Una Healy, her husband Ben Foden and daughter Aoife Belle collected seven per cent for the vote.

Designer and WAG Coleen Rooney and her family polled six per cent of the vote, with Myleene Klass and her daughters Ava and Hero, and Peter Crouch, Abbey Clancy and their toddler Sophia taking joint eighth place with four per cent.

Keeping up: The Kardashian family, known for their savvy style, came in second place

Coming in at the bottom of the poll was the Windsors, who were applauded by just two per cent of those surveyed for their timeless elegance.

A spokesman from TVBet.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said the results show that David and Victoria have passed on their sense of style to their children, with the family set to set trends across a number of age groups for many years to come.

He said: 'Ever since Victoria and David started dating back in 1999 they’ve been acknowledged as a trend-setting couple – something which seems to have rubbed off on their children too.

Flying high: The Middleton sisters and the Rooney's also came high in the poll

'More than a decade down the line they’re still immaculately turned out and whilst there have been a few faux pas along the way - who can forget David’s curtains or his sarong - they always look sharp and stylish.

'Romeo is already modelling and it seems only a matter of time before Harper Seven takes to the catwalk as well.'

He continued: 'The Kardashians came in second having been praised for daring to wear outfits to complement their curvaceous figures.

'It’s good to see music royalty like Beyoncé and Jay-Z sit alongside our own Royal Family. The diversity of the families in the top ten shows that being stylish is about dressing for yourself and in clothes that work for you.'

Here comes the girls: Myleene and her family were also top contenders in the style list
