A new app can turn any wine novice into an almost instant expert by scanning the bottle with their smartphone.

WineGlass was developed by former Facebook engineer Roddy Lindsay after he and his brother were in a Moscow restaurant and their ‘eyes glazed over with anxiety and shame’ while staring at the wine menu.

‘Like many poor saps whose wine knowledge consisted of a preference for white, or possibly red, the natural instinct was simply to choose the second cheapest,' he explains.

WineGlass is a new app for Apple devices which promises to turn any wine novice into an almost instant expert by providing a wide range of information about a particular bottle

'How are we normals ever supposed to know
 what the hell Coche-Dury Auxey-Duresses, Cote de Beaune means? Is it a 
red, or a white?’

Then and there Lindsay hit upon a potential gap in the market for an app that could make it easier for anyone to discern what is a good value bottle of wine and what is a rip-off price.

Currently available for iPhone users to download for $5, the user points their camera at a wine menu and takes a photo. 

WineGlass then scans the wine names using optical character recognition and matches them against its partner CellarTracker’s database of over one million reviews.

The user can then tap down the list in your 
photo, and WineGlass will display what you should expect to pay for a 
bottle at a restaurant, a star rating, point score, what the wine tastes
 like, and what food it pairs well with.

Lindsay believes the app will be good for the wine industry as it will help improve pricing transparency.

‘So what this allows is for normal people who haven't spent years studying wine to be able to buy that glass of wine that you know is gonna be a great wine for your own taste and budget,’ he told CBS News.

Lindsay also believes that the same tech could be used to produce a beer app in the future.
