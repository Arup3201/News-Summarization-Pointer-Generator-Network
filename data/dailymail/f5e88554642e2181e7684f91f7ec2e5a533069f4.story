USA international DeAndre Yedlin could complete his switch to Tottenham as soon as January, if he succeeds in applying for a Latvian passport.

The 21-year-old right-back signed from Seattle Sounders over the summer, before immediately being loaned back to the MLS club for the season.

Spurs are currently without regulars Kyle Walker and Kyle Naughton through injury, leaving youngster Eric Dier as the only recognised right-back in the squad.

So should he resolve his passport issues in time, a move in the upcoming transfer window could well be on the cards.

'A big deciding factor is my passport, I’m working on getting a Latvian passport,' Yedlin told ESPN. 'If that goes through, then January is definitely very possible. It’s either June or January.

'I always knew I had that sort of background. I never really paid attention to it, but it’s become useful now and I’m going to take advantage of it.'

And fellow right-back Kyle Naughton went off injured against Southampton on Sunday

Yedlin also revealed that he had received an offer from Roma, but chose White Hart Lane because he believed he would better suit the Premier League.

'I could have signed for Roma, but I just felt that England fits my playing style better and Tottenham was a good situation for me,' he added.

'I'm an attacking full-back. They have Kyle Walker and I'm excited to learn from him and learn from the other full-backs and coach Mauricio Pochettino, who's great with young players.'
