Google’s increasing interest in sport will see England manager Roy Hodgson being interviewed in a live video call from their London headquarters this week.

Hodgson will be joined by the other home nation managers — Scotland’s Gordon Strachan, Chris Coleman of Wales and Northern Ireland’s Michael O’Neill — in an initiative by Vauxhall, who sponsor all four countries, ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

Google are expected at least to consider the digital content in the next Premier League tender at the end of the year and are understood to be in the bidding for digital rights to major cricket tournaments.

The FA have welcomed Hodgson’s debut on Google+ knowing they will need every possible media outlet to promote an unappetising set of Euro fixtures that follow on from a dismal World Cup. And before that, England are likely to attract their lowest crowd for an international at the new Wembley when they face Norway in a friendly on September 3.

However, despite Germany also putting in a bid, Wembley remains the hottest of favourites to be awarded the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 by UEFA on September 19.

UEFA have again demonstrated how much they like England’s national stadium by choosing it to host a workshop for football media chiefs from across Europe the day after the Norway game, for which the 130 representatives could have a row each to watch from, let alone a seat.

Barclays are not expected to renew their title backing of the Premier League after next season. But they have still decided, after many years, to revamp their judging panel for the Manager and Player of the Month awards, with old timers Gary Newbon and John Motson among those stood down. The winners used to be chosen quickly, followed by the longest of lunches at a private members club in London.

Sky are leading the chase for Thierry Henry’s services if he retires at the end of the MLS season in October. Arsenal’s record goalscorer, who made a big impression as an analyst for the BBC during the World Cup, has still to decide whether to hang up his boots with the New York Red Bulls. If Henry  does, Sky head a queue that includes BT Sport and beIN Sports. Henry will be able to command as much as £10,000 per programme, such is the market for big-name analysts, who have never had it so good with the openings available at home and in Qatar.

Manchester United didn’t show much unison in their defeat against Swansea. This is despite manager Louis van Gaal’s bonding exercise of bringing in representatives from various club departments — including media spokeswoman Karen Shotbolt — to regularly eat with the players.

Cagey Platini’s Plan B

An intriguing new name has emerged as a possible challenger for the FIFA presidency if UEFA chief Michael Platini declines to stand against Sepp Blatter next year.

Platini will announce his decision after consulting his UEFA colleagues in Monaco on August 28, but the odds are against him wanting to take on Blatter. In that case, UEFA will put up Holland’s Michael van Praag or even pledge support for another potential election runner, US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati.

The combative Gulati sits on FIFA’s executive committee and has been an outspoken critic of the way Blatter runs FIFA since Qatar beat the USA to host the 2022 World Cup.

There is a strong desire among ECB directors for chairman Giles Clarke to reveal his plans ahead of the appointment of the next chief executive. Clarke may stand for another term in 2015, split the chairmanship between international and domestic affairs with Yorkshire’s Colin Graves, or concentrate entirely on ICC business. Whatever Clarke’s ambitions, his fellow powerbrokers want him to declare his hand, while the incoming CEO will surely be keen to know his intentions before signing a contract.
