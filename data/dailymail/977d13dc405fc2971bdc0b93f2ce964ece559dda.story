Sir Richard Branson's holiday home Necker Island is a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty - Kate Moss is even rumoured to be celebrating her 40th birthday there.

But, if the lush sands and seas of the £40,000 per night tropical paradise aren't to your taste, the Virgin boss has an equally incredible holiday home up for rent.

Welcome to Mahali Mzuri - Branson’s tented camp in a pristine part of the African bush with a front row view of the sweeping landscape and fascinating wildlife.

Home sweet home: Welcome to Mahali Mzuri - Sir Richard Branson's tented camp with a front row view of the African bush

Room with a view: Mahali Mzuri has infinity pools and luxurious rooms with incredible views of the 13,500 hectares of bush

And...relax! The 12 luxury tents are perched on a ridge looking over the spectacular valley

Mahali Mzuri is located in the Olare Motorogi Conservancy, where there are 13,500 hectares of bush to explore.

Against the backdrop of a valley and sprawling plains as far as the eye can see, visitors to Mahali Mzuri can expect exciting game drives, delicious meals, a cozy and relaxing atmosphere at camp and in a uniquely designed, spacious and luxurious tent, promise the company renting out the property.

The 12 tents, which can sleep up to 24 people in total, are perched on a ridge looking over the spectacular valley. There is also a 12-metre infinity pool which shares the same jaw-dropping views.

In true Virgin style, there are iPads all over the place for guest's use, games consoles, a spa treatment room and an unlimited bar - including champagne.

You'll never get bored at Mahil Mzuri, which opened its doors last year. There's early morning, late afternoon and nighttime game drives, as well as safari walks, cultural day trips to learn more about the Maasai Tribe, trips to the Maasai Mara National Reserve and even hot air ballooning in the Maasai Mara.

Heading to the luxurious haunt in high season (July 1 - October 19) will set you back £634 per person per night, while low season (April 1 - June 30 or November 21 - December 21) costs £376 per person per night. The prices include everything from game drives to all food and drink.
