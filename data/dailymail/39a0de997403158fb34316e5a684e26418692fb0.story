A police officer who starred in the TV series Motorway Cops was 'bullied and booted off her team' after she warned managers about a fault with the flashing lights on patrol cars, a tribunal has heard.

Jessica Davies claims she was moved into an office role after she highlighted the computer glitch that meant the cars' blue lights switched off during high-speed chases.

The 34-year-old, who began for the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) in July 2009, argued that it could put motorists and officers at risk when they are in pursuit of suspect vehicles.

At the tribunal in Birmingham, the panel heard West Midlands Police put her at 'detriment as a result of whistleblowing'.

She also claims she was bullied by her superiors and on one occasion was reduced to tears by a sergeant who made a remark about her pregnancy.

PC Davies, who became a police officer in 2001, appeared on the BBC TV show under her maiden name Rojek, and showed her as she chased criminals in the West Midlands and Staffordshire.

In March 2012 she was involved in a 120mph crash on the M42, which left her off work for two weeks, and she claims officers were not given the right guidance when pursuing suspect vehicles. 

She told the tribunal: 'I raised concerns that there was a known fault on the Staffordshire Police traffic vehicles.

'This fault means that the computer system resets itself and switches off the blue response lights. This obviously causes a danger to the public. 

'I also highlighted that there was no Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) response policy on the unit and that this had been raised by two other officers 12 months earlier.

She has told an employment tribunal that on one occasion was reduced to tears by a sergeant who made a remark about her having a miscarriage

'I had no problem with ANPR per se, however I was concerned that there needed to be a proper response policy in place so that officers were not moving around at high speeds without cause or guidance.

'It was quite alien to myself that jobs were being put out over the air without any direction as to how I would respond to them bearing in mind I had completed 10 years services whereby I was a response officers where every job I went to was graded.

She joined the Central Motorway Police Group in 2009 and was told in January 2014 she was being taken off the team 'due to lack of trust'

'And it really brought it home to me when I was involved in my own police accident in March 2012.

'Some of the officers had raised it formally, other officers it had been just general discussions on breaks.

'The two officers who raised it on more formal channels are no longer CMPG officers.'

'On January 1, 2014 I was contacted by Chief Superintendent Martin Evans who told me that I would no longer be working on the unit upon my return from maternity leave due to lack of trust and confidence and my concerns around ANPR management systems.

'I was shocked, angry and extremely upset, as if my entire world had just collapsed. I also felt and still feel extremely humiliated.'

PC Davies, from Tyseley in Birmingham, also told how she was reduced to tears when a sergeant made an 'insensitive' comment to her after she suffered a miscarriage in October 2012.

She said: 'I was asked by Police Sergeant Richard Gathergood to work in the control room.

'I pointed out to him that I hadn't even logged into the Oasis account [police incident logs] since my training and in fact I could not even remember how to use the system and would be of no use.

'He then quite insensitively said "you were there when you were pregnant so you know how it works".

'This was merely four weeks after my miscarriage and I found the comments to be extremely upsetting and I became increasingly distressed.

'To make matters worse he also commented that I need to be a team player and that he would be telling the control room staff that they couldn't have their annual leave because of me.

She appeared on the BBC TV series under her maiden name, Rojek, and was involved in a 120mph crash on the M42, which left her off work for two weeks, during a high-speed chase

'I broke down in tears in front of him as the emotions of the miscarriage came flooding back. To my dismay I was then accused of overreacting.

'I believe the decision to move me to the control room was made in response to the complaints I had made shortly before.

'To my mind it seemed to be another way to bully and victimise me and felt like a punishment as I had always made it clear I did not want to work in the control room.'

The hearing, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.
