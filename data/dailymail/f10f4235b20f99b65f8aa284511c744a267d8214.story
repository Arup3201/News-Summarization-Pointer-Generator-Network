Fashion designer Lela Rose has unveiled a chic new plus-size collection for clothing retailer Lane Bryant.

The collection, which will hit stores in April 2015, offers bold watercolor prints, peekaboo lace and sheer pieces and sleek, tailored  silhouettes in sizes 14 to 28.

The New York designer told Refinery29 that she wanted the plus-size line, which includes tops, skirts, pants and dresses, to feature the hallmarks that her label is known for.

New collaboration: Fashion designer Lela Rose has unveiled a chic new plus-size collection for clothing retailer Lane Bryant

'I felt strongly about taking certain colors and techniques that are signature to the Lela Rose collection and incorporating them into this capsule for Lane Bryant,' she said. 'For example, I love the citrine lace top - citrine is my favorite color!'

The entire collection is under $200, and most pieces are in the $40-$90 range. 

Ms Rose, who previously collaborated with Payless on a budget-friendly shoe collection, said she was eager to make her designs more accessible.

'The most exciting thing for me is the democratization of fashion, and not every designer gets a chance to do that,' she told Fashionista. 'We live in our own price point, in our own world.'

Bright idea: The collection, which will hit stores in April 2015, offers bold watercolor prints, peekaboo lace and tailored feminine silhouettes in sizes 14 to 28

Well tailored: 'I felt strongly about taking certain colors and techniques that are signature to the Lela Rose collection and incorporating them into this capsule for Lane Bryant,' the designer said

'We've always had customers coming and asking, "Why don't you do this in my size?" and our only answer has been that our retailers don't really service that customer,' she added.

This is the first foray into plus-size fashion for Ms Rose, whose designs have been worn by Kate Middleton, Michelle Obama various other celebrities.

Ms Rose consulted with the Lane Bryant to find out more about its customers' preferences - which mainly included adding sleeves - but said the experience was similar to designing for her own ready-to-wear line.

Accessible: 'The most exciting thing for me is the democratization of fashion, and not every designer gets a chance to do that,' she said

Similar preferences: '[Plus-size] women don't want anything that different,' the designer said

 

High fashion: 'They want to look feminine and pretty, they want to have great color, texture, and detail, and they want to show off neckline and collarbones,' she added

'[Plus-size] women don't want anything that different,' she said. 'They want to look feminine and pretty, they want to have great color, texture, and detail, and they want to show off neckline and collarbones.'

Lane Bryant previously joined forces with designer Isabel Toledo this past spring for a plus-size collection of feminine skirts, printed sheath dresses and elegant evening coats that ranged from $60 to $178.

Earlier this year, the retailer also teamed up with French designer Sophie Theallet to launch a sexy lingerie collection.
