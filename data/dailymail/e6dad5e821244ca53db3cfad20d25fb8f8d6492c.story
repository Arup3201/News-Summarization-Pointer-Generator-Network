A five-year-old British girl has drowned in a swimming pool at a hotel where her family were staying while on holiday in Cyprus.

Police in Protaras have confirmed the unnamed youngster was spotted floating unconscious in the water on Monday.

The incident was reported to hotel staff at around 4pm on Monday.

An ambulance took the girl to a private clinic in Paralimni, but doctors could not revive her.

Police spokesman George Economou confirmed: ‘At around 4pm this afternoon, the little girl aged five years was spotted floating unconscious in the pool.’

It is believed the girl, from England, had arrived in Cyprus on Sunday with her mother, grandparents and other relatives for a week-long holiday.

It has been claimed that no lifeguard was present at the swimming pool at the hotel – which has not been named - but there were signs in English, Russian and other languages urging adult supervision of children.

An autopsy was being performed at the Larnaca General Hospital in order to confirm the cause of death.

An FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Larnaca, Cyprus, on the 16th June. We are providing consular assistance at this sad time.'

The child was taken to a private clinic nearby, but could not be saved by medics. Her body was then taken to Larnaca General Hospital (pictured) for an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death
