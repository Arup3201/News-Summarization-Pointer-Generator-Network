A Florida court has heard the recordings of a Tampa mother telling a detectives that her teenagers were mean and that she hoped they were dead- just hours after their bodies were found.

Prosecutors on Wednesday played a recorded interview between Julie Schenecker and Tampa Police Detective Gary Sandel, conducted in January 2011.

Schenecker is accused of killing her 16-year-old daughter Calyx and 13-year-old son Beau.

'I loved them when they were birth through six,' Julie Schenecker told Tampa Police Detective Gary Sandel in January 2011.

But they became 'sassy' as teens, she said, especially her daughter.

Insane or premeditated: A tape was played for the court which heard Julie Schenecker telling a detective that her children were mean and that she hoped they were dead- hours after their bodies were found (pictured in court on Tuesday)

'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, a recording of which was played in court Wednesday.

'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.'

Schenecker,
 who is now 53, also told Sandel how she met her husband, Parker 
Schenecker, while both served in the military and said she worked as a 
military debriefer in the Army before having children.

She
 has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to two counts of 
first-degree murder. If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence 
without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty.

During the interview, her voice was slow and slurred. She said she had been in therapy and took multiple prescriptions, including Lithium for bipolar disorder.

She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide.

'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.'

During the interview, Schenecker did appear confused at times.

'Are my kids coming in later?' she asked the detective.

Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him.

'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to the detective. 'What do you think?'

'They're dead,' Sandel replied.

His side: The recording was played the day after her ex-husband Paul Schenecker took the stand (pictrued Tuesday) telling how he was an Army colonel deployed in the Middle East when his children were killed

Schenecker detailed how she had 
intended to kill herself after she killed her teens, but wasn't able to 
articulate why she didn't.

'Beau went first, Calyx went second. I'd sure as hell like to go third,' she said.

Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest.

'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said.

'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.'

Prosecutors argue that the slayings were premeditated as opposed to the result of a mental break.

The recording was played the day after her ex-husband Paul Schenecker took the stand.

He
 told how Julie, who he was still married to at the time of their 
children's' deaths, starred at him coldly immediately after he heard the
 devastating news and said: 'I guess I stomped your heart flat, huh?'

During
 his questioning by prosecutors in Hillsborough County Court, Parker 
Schenecker did not mention Julie Schenecker by name, instead calling her
 'the defendant' or his 'ex-wife.'

He was an Army colonel deployed in the Middle East when his children were killed.

Parker Schenecker did not show any emotion as he testified for a little more than an hour.

He identified various items from the family's home in photographs, and affirmed that the handwriting in a spiral-bound notebook was Julie's.

The 50-year-old read one sticky note aloud: 'Tuesday, Feb. 1 Beau is in the van (on the way to practice) Calyx is in her bed tried to make her comfortable.'

Victims: Beau Schenecker, 13, was shot dead by his mother
 on the way to soccer practice in 2011. His sister Calyx (right) was 
then murdered by her mother while she sat at their home computer

Prosecutors said the note was written by Julie Schenecker and detailed the location of the teens' bodies.

Parker
 said that he had no concerns about the kids' safety with their mother 
while he was deployed, even though his wife had suffered from mental 
illness, was taking pills and uncharacteristically drinking.

Julie
 Schenecker and Calyx were also at odds with each other, he said, and he
 thought the situation would soon be under control because the teen was 
supposed to attend a boarding school.

'To let the situation settle down,' he said.

Earlier in the day, Tampa Police crime scene analyst Matthew Evans said that Julie Schenecker had written in her journal that she thought her children would inherit her bipolar disorder and that she was rescuing them from depression and mental illness.

'I believed I've saved them from the pain,' Julie Schenecker wrote, according to Evans. 'I wish this on nobody.'

Schenecker wrote of 'going to heaven,' and she both apologized to and chastised Parker Schenecker, the analyst testified.

'You didn't teach the kids to be compassionate,' she wrote.

Motivations: Julie Schenecker, seen listening as her ex-husband Packer testified, is bipolar and on several medications so her defense team have entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea

Evans said Julie Schenecker also described how she had stayed in bed for seven weeks, with none of her family spending time with her. 'Neither were you,' she wrote of her husband.

'I sense divorce is inevitable,' she also wrote, according to Evans' testimony. 'I can't live alone.'

Her writings show she intended to commit suicide by shooting herself, inhaling carbon monoxide or taking pills.

'I don't believe I could ever recover or make up for my failures over the years,' she wrote.
