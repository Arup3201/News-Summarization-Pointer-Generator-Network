Ghoulish: A macabre new gambling trend is starting to gather pace in Taiwan where bets are being placed on the life expectancy of sick patients

A macabre new gambling trend is starting to gather pace in Taiwan where bets are being placed on the life expectancy of sick patients.

Worth more than £20million ($30m) the death gambling market in the town of Taichun is allowing people to wager a bet on when the old, the cancer-ridden and terminally-ill will die.

The craze is not just restricted to ghoulish gamblers - bets have also been placed by doctors, nurses and other hospital staff as well as families and guardians.

According to local media some 60 
so-called 'senior citizens clubs' are in place posing as charitable 
organisations for the elderly.

Gamblers who want to take part in betting on the unwitting human roulette wheels have to pay a 
membership fee of NT$2,000 (£43) to the bookies, according to The 
Mirror.

The bookies then visit hospitals, do a round to survey possible bets and then seek permission from the patients' family.

Then they take the punters to the hospital on their next visit to observe the patients.

According to the rules, the bookies win if the cancer patients die within a month.

However, if they die between one and six months after the bets were placed, the gamblers would be paid three times their wager.

Big money: Worth more than £20 million ($30m) the death gambling market in the town of Taichun is allowing people to place money on when the old, the cancer-ridden and terminally-ill die

Some pots are reported to have run to more than £1million.

The Times reported that some families agree to take part to pay for funeral costs.

Police are said to be investigating the practice and the legal implications.

In some cases families are thought to have been
offered special bonuses by organisers if they instruct doctors to 
withhold life-prolonging treatments.
