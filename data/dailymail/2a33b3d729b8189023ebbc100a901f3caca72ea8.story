He is known for being one of the most ruthless dictators on the planet. But after a bodyguard has died and a homeless man was left with serious injuries in two separate incidents on the same journey, Robert Mugabe has been living up to his reputation.

The Zimbabwean president was on his way to a funeral when the two incidents occurred.

First of all, one of the tyrant's outrider 
motorbikes allegedly ran into a homeless man as they rushed the 
octogenarian president to a funeral.

The independent Daily News reported 
that the unnamed victim was rushed to hospital following the gruesome 
near-fatal accident on Wednesday.

A source told the newspaper: 'If that guy is still alive, it is a miracle. The bike ripped through the man's legs while the bike rider was thrown off. The scene was so ghastly and bloody that one would not take a second glance.'

The Daily News reported that the 
motorbike which knocked down the pedestrian had been the first vehicle 
in Mugabe's motorcade, which is reportedly one of the longest in Africa.

The newspaper claimed the rest of the 
statesman's long chain of vehicles sped by without stopping to help the 
victim, who is believed to be a homeless man.

Mugabe's motorcade had two accidents on his way to a funeral

It reported: 'When the Daily News 
arrived at the scene of accident, which was guarded by police officers, 
the damaged motorbike was being loaded into an unidentified truck.

'An eye-witness said the bike was speeding and ran into the vagabond, who was in the middle of the road. The motorcade sped past the accident scene in usual fashion and did not stop to assist the injured.

'The vagrant and rider were taken to hospital by ambulances that arrived at the scene later.'

The motorcycle accident was reportedly the first of two smashes involving Mugabe's motorcade on Wednesday.

The 88-year-old statesman is 
traditionally ensconced safely in a luxury Mercedes limousine when he 
travels around his poverty-stricken country.

The presidential vehicle is 
accompanied by more than a dozen others as part of an extensive 
motorcade which includes Land Cruisers, security vehicles full of armed 
soldiers, high-powered motorcycles and a standby ambulance.

It is believed Mugabe was being 
transported from Zimbabwe's capital Harare on Wednesday to a funeral in 
his home village of Zvimba when the accident happened.

The Daily News reported that several 
of the leader's security guards were later injured in a second accident 
after a tyre blew out in one of their Land Cruisers.

Presidential spokesman George Charamba confirmed the victims of both accidents had been taken to hospital.

The motorcade smash comes a decade after Mugabe brought in new laws to ease his passage around Zimbabwe.

Since 2002 motorists have been legally required to pull over if they see the presidential car approaching.

It is also an offence to gesticulate at the motorcade with the intention of insulting those inside.

Offenders have previously been arrested or met with a robust physical response from Mugabe's guards.
