Didier Drogba is at the centre of claims that he isn't
eligible to play in the Champions League.

The former Chelsea striker made his return in the
competition in Galatasaray's 1-1 draw with Schalke last night.

It was the first time he has played in the tournament since
helping the Blues to victory in the final against Bayern Munich last May.

But he is now facing claims that he should not have been
allowed on the pitch to face the Germans.

Schalke are now considering whether to appeal but did not go
into detail over their specific grievance.

A club statement read: 'There are doubts about the validity
of the permission to play for Drogba in the Champions League. Schalke 04
reserves its rights and is looking into this.'

Drogba signed for Galatasaray earlier this year from Chinese
side Shanghai Shenhua - just six months after quitting Chelsea.

He is on an 18-month loan deal at the Turkish giants and is
bidding to guide them to European glory along with Dutch ace Wesley Sneijder.

The controversy relates to the Ivorian's former club in China, Shanghai Shenhua, challenging Drogba's move to Galatasaray.

Shenhua officials previously claimed the Champions League winner remains under contract with them and it seems that Schalke are willing to test that argument with UEFA.

Shanghai Shenhua, who he joined from Chelsea last summer, issued a statement on their website earlier this month describing themselves as 'deeply shocked' by the announcement, and insisting Drogba remains under contract in China.

'We understand that Drogba is eager to participate in the European Champions League,' the statement read. 'Shanghai
Shenhua Football Club and Drogba on July 1, 2012 officially signed a 
formal contract for a period of two and a half years. The club has acted
in accordance with this contract, and has effectively fulfilled the 
responsibilities and obligations of the club.

'Drogba is still a 
player of Shanghai Shenhua Football Club, the contract between the two 
parties is still within the period of validity.

'Shanghai Shenhua 
is prepared to collate all the evidence and information and submit it to
FIFA in order to protect its interests.'

Drogba, speaking 
through his representatives Sports PR Company on Twitter, said at the 
time of his signing for the Turkish giants: 'The opportunity to play for
this great club was an offer that I could not turn down.

'I am looking forward to playing in the Champions League again, against the best clubs in Europe.'

UEFA rules stipulate that players must be registered with their club by February 1, if they are to feature in the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Schalke sports director Horst Heldt and finance chief Peter Peters confirmed they would appeal.

'It would be negligent not to have it checked,' Heldt said.

Peters said: 'There is the suspicion that he received his eligibility after the end of the deadline to register the player for the UEFA Champions League.

'Before each game UEFA states that every club has to take responsibility for the players used. It is now up to UEFA to decide and Schalke will respect this process.'

Jermaine Jones' strike in the last minute
of the first half gave Schalke a slight advantage in Istanbul.

Jones calmly slotted home after Jefferson Farfan had squared the ball to
him to give the German side a vital draw at the Turk Telekom Arena, 
although Schalke's goalscorer will miss the second leg after picking up a
booking.

Burak Yilmaz had earlier put Gala in front with a piece of individual 
brilliance but they could not extend their lead in a breathtaking 
first-half in which both teams failed to convert several glorious 
opportunities.

The second half was less open, although Yilmaz nearly gave the
hosts a slender lead heading into the second leg but could only fire 
wide of the target.

Drogba and Wesley Sneijder both made their returns to 
the Champions League after completing recent moves to Gala from Shanghai Shenhua
and Inter Milan respectively.

But it was Yilmaz who produced a moment of magic worthy of either of the pair when he broke the deadlock in sparkling fashion.

The forward collected the ball from Selcuk Inan on the edge of the area 
before flicking over Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes with his heel and
wonderfully firing into the roof of the net in the 12th minute.

It was a sickening blow for the visitors, who had seen Gala keeper 
Fernando Muslera make fine saves from both Jones and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar
in the opening minute.

Nevertheless they nearly levelled almost immediately after Yilmaz's 
brilliance, but Huntelaar just failed to connect with Howedes' flick-on 
from Farfan's corner.

And in an increasingly open first half, they were nearly made to pay 
when Howedes fired against the bar with the goal gaping after Drogba had
seen his left-footed strike fingertipped away by Schalke goalkeeper 
Timo Hildebrand.

It was the German side who nearly scored next though, with Semih Kaya 
deflecting Farfan's cutback wide of his own post, while the influential 
Schalke striker struck over on the turn despite being given plenty of 
space in the area.

Both sides seemed to view attack as the best form of defence and Drogba,
who was making a nuisance of himself in Schalke's backline, played in 
Yilmaz but he could not lift his effort over Hildebrand.

Yet Schalke drew level on the stroke of half-time courtesy of United 
States midfielder Jones, who will miss the second leg after picking 
up a booking for dissent.

Farfan burst through on goal after Gala had given the ball away in 
midfield and squared for the free Jones and he calmly struck past 
Muslera.

It was a far more subdued affair after the interval although Schalke did
have a decent penalty appeal turned down when Farfan's fierce strike 
looked to have cannoned off Sabri Sarioglu's hands, which were raised to
his chest.

It was not until late on that the game sprang back into life, with 
Yilmaz shooting across the face of goal from Drogba's inch-perfect 
flick-on while Sarioglu's half-volley from the edge of the area was 
tipped over by Hildebrand.

And Gala's efforts to push for a winner nearly backfired completely 
when, at the other end, Julian Draxler dribbled to the edge of their box
unchecked before shooting inches wide of Muslera's right-hand post.
