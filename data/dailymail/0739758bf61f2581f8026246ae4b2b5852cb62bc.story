A private school in Nashville has turned down two prospective students because their parents are gay, telling the parents 'we strongly believe in a strict interpretation of the Scriptures regarding the institution of marriage'.

Brian Copeland and Greg Bullard are married and have two children — a son who is about to enter pre-kindergarten and a daughter who is 8 months old.

The couple had scheduled a visit to Davidson Academy after receiving a recommendation from a friend, but were shocked on January 14 when they received a letter informing them that their visit was cancelled after the school learned that their children were being raised by two gay men.

In a letter addressed to Copeland, a real estate agent, the school wrote that homosexuality goes against the school's admission policy as stated in their handbook.

'I believe another education provider would be a better fit for your children. Therefore, we cannot grant admission to your children,' read the letter.

Copeland posted the letter on Facebook but redacted the name of the school, however The Tennessean has confirmed that the school is Davidson Academy.

On its website Davidson Academy describes itself as an 'interdenominational, college-preparatory school serving students age three through 12th grade'. 

Copeland wrote on Facebook that he had shared the letter to 'let my friends know that discrimination affects people you know and love and still hurts no matter how many times you go through it.

'We chose this school because of its rigorous faith-based K-12 academics and extracurricular activities; and, a friend with a son there asked them if a family like ours would be allowed and was told yes. 

Copeland and Bullard, who is a pastor, officially married in California in 2013 after holding a ceremony in Nashville in 2006. They have raised both children since their births

'After a phone conversation, fully disclosing we are a two-dad family, an appointment was set for us. I receive this letter canceling our appointment without even getting a chance.'

In the letter sent to Copeland by Davidson Academy officials, they wrote that the school was founded by Christians and operates in the Christian tradition based on 'clear tenets of faith and practice.'

The letter also made reference to the school's admissions policy as outlined in its handbook, which requires all students, parents, guardians, teachers and administrators and staff to 'manifest lifestyle conduct and actions which project an image consistent with the expressed purposes, missions and beliefs of the school.' 

One example of this, the policy says, is homosexuality.

The couple don't intend to take legal action against the school and are currently looking at alternatives

'Davidson Academy has the right and responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that its expressed purposes, mission, and beliefs continue in their highest traditions and are not harmed, compromised, or hindered by unacceptable lifestyle conduct on the part of its students, parents or guardians ...' the policy reads.

Copeland told The Tennessean that he and Bullard's goal is 'not to harm the school' but to show that 'discrimination and inequality is alive and well.'

He also stressed that he and his husband are not victims.

'I want to make that very clear,' Copeland said. 'We want our children to have a Christian education, and we're finding that very, very hard.'

The couple don't intend to take legal action against the school and are currently looking at alternatives.

'We want the best for our kids, and THEY deserve to be given a chance,' wrote Copeland.
