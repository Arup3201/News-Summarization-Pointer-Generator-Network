Dogan Ismail, 17, pictured, died outside a block of flats on the Aylesbury Estate, in Walworth, south east London

A teenager was stabbed to death protecting his younger brother from a gang that had stolen a phone.

Dogan Ismail, 17, died after being knifed in the chest on Sunday afternoon at a block of flats in Walworth, south-east London.

The sixth-form student and his younger 
brother Orhan, 15, had gone to retrieve a stolen BlackBerry
when they were confronted by up to four youths and a row broke out.

The mobile phone had previously been stolen by a trio of pupils - that Orhan recognised from his school - as he walked home from playing football.

Two days later he received a message saying: 'If you come here we will give it back to you,' according to The Sun.

The pair headed to Latimer House to retrieve the phone, but instead one of the boys pulled out a knife and stabbed Dogan in the chest at the top of a stairwell.

The teenager bled to death as his younger brother tried desperately to save his life.

Orhan later told his family: 'He made to give back the phone, but instead brought a knife from behind his back and stabbed Dogan in the chest.

Police carrying out investigations into the latest incident while flowers remain lying in tribute following the death of a 21-year-old man in September

'His last words were, ‘Oh my God, you have stabbed me!’ The guy just calmly walked away.'

Police have now taken the unusual step of naming a youth wanted for questioning in connection with Dogan's death.

Dawda Jallow, 15, from the Peckham 
area, is described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, 
5ft 5in tall and slightly built.

He has brown eyes and speaks with a London accent, although he is a Gambian national.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner
of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, leading the investigation, 
said: 'I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda 
Jallow. I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any 
information that could assist us, to come forward.

'If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police.

Neighbours in the area have said they are living in fear following the second incident in a matter of months

'I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with.'
Dogan, who is believed to have studied at the Walworth Academy, is of Turkish origin and lived in nearby Peckham.

The Metropolitan Police and London 
Ambulance Service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at 
4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was 
subsequently pronounced dead.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested 
on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of 
perverting the course of justice, and were yesterday bailed.

Mr Bonner added: 'My thoughts go out 
to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless 
killing. That it should happen at this time of year is all the more 
tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident
to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to 
remain anonymous, Crimestoppers.

Shaun Chambers, 21, died on September 26 after being stabbed in an apparent gang-related killing

The murder scene is yards from where 
21-year-old Shaun Chambers died on September 26 after being stabbed in 
an apparent gang-related killing.

Mr Chambers, 21, from Greenwich, was stabbed in the heart.

However Mr Bonner said there was 'no evidence' to suggest Dogan's death was gang related.

He said: 'I know there will also be 
local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same
spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like 
to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the
location.'

Dogan is the eighth teenager to be murdered in London in 2012.

Residents on the estate today said 
they were living in fear following the second such incident on their 
doorstep in the space of a few months.

A mother-of-two, who did not want to 
be identified, said: 'This is a very bad estate. It's so dangerous. I 
want to move, but I have to wait for the council to move me because I am
poor.'

A 39-year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested in connection with the latest incident
