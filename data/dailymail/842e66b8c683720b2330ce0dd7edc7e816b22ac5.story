Legal action: Gillian Stokes, 44, won her unfair dismissal case against Shrewsbury School but did not get compensation

A tuck shop lady who won an unfair dismissal case from a prestigious independent school was arrested yesterday after driving onto the school's cricket pitch and doing 'doughnuts.'

Eyewitnesses saw Gillian Stokes, 44, drive onto the pitch at Shrewsbury School in Shropshire with such force that she scattered staff and pupils as she did high-speed doughnuts in her car.

The school, whose alumni include Charles Darwin, descended into chaos as Ms Stokes then chased a teacher around with a fire extinguisher.

The former tuck shop worker had been sacked from her job at the £30,000-a-year school and took them to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013.

But although she won the hearing in Birmingham, she did not receive any compensation.

According to staff, pupils were practicing cricket on the cricket pitch - which the cricket-writer Sir Neville Cardus described as the 'The most beautiful playing fields in the world, spreading and imperceptibly mingling with the pasture land of Shropshire.'

Ms Stokes then drove onto the pitch and did several high-speed doughnuts, spinning her car, which has personalised number plates on it, into big circles.

No students were injured.

But, members of staff quickly realised it was her and called the police while leading pupils to safety.

She was arrested by West Mercia Police, according to The Telegraph but a spokesman declined to give further comment on her case.

Kathy 
Campbell, a spokesperson for Shrewsbury School told Mail Online: 'Ms 
Stokes did briefly and unexpectedly enter the School site yesterday 
(contravening an injunction banning her from the premises).

'Ms
 Stokes drove her car onto the cricket pitch at speed but nobody was 
injured. The police were called and the incident was dealt with swiftly 
and calmly.

'We
 praise the professional and dignified approach adopted by all members 
of the School community who were involved on this occasion. The matter 
is now being dealt with by West Mercia Police.'

However it's not the first time Ms Stokes has been in trouble.

Days after she was fired, she allegedly sent an 
email to all 750 students at the school claiming she had been sexually 
assaulted by a female member of staff.

She had also been accused of making threatening phone calls and sending 
abusive text messages to former colleagues she felt ‘had betrayed her’, 
the tribunal heard.

Ms
 Stokes, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, claimed she had been 
sacked because of her activities with the UCAT trade union.

She also added 
that she felt ‘traumatised’ following the alleged assaults and claimed 
she was threatened by another member of staff in February 2012 because 
she organised an unauthorised union meeting.

She said: ‘He threatened me with the sack and placed his hands on my polo-shirt collars and said 'we will get you for this.'

Ms
 Stokes admitted sending an email to staff and pupils claiming she had 
been sexually assaulted saying she ‘regretted her actions’ adding that 
she did it while suffering ‘great emotional distress.’

However, she denied sending messages to former colleagues, including one which read: ‘Careful when you go home.

She had worked at the school for 17 years.
