Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha has lifted the lid on his difficult time at Manchester Untied. 

Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed from Palace by former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 for a fee believed to be around £15 million. 

But he was loaned straight back to The Eagles for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at Old Trafford until the following summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. 

Zaha was signed by former Manchester Untied manager Sir Alex Ferguson for around £15m in January 2013 

'Sir Alex obviously saw something in me and that's why he brought me to United. But I never got to be coached by him. I signed and by the time I came back (from the loan spell at Palace), he had left. That was weird,' Zaha told The Sun. 

The forward was a peripheral figure under Moyes, used sparingly and sometimes out of position. 

And the lack of first-team opportunities afforded to him, coupled with the stresses of moving to Manchester alone, proved frustrating for the youngster. 

'I had a lot to deal with living on my own in Manchester. It was lonely. It wasn't the best,' he said, 'If you're not playing, you're not happy.' 

After failing to make an impact under Moyes, Zaha was loaned to Cardiff City for the second half of last season. 

Although life off the pitch improved at Cardiff, with one of Zaha's brothers making the move to the Welsh capital to keep him company, the forward's form did not, as he contributed just one assist in 11 games. 

Zaha found first-team opportunities hard to come by at United and has been loaned back to Crystal Palace

Zaha returned to Palace again at the start of this season on another loan deal and could yet rejoin The Eagles permanently in the summer. 

The 22-year-old has been given a new lease of life under Palace boss Alan Pardew and is working hard towards rediscovering the sort of of form that led United to sign him two years ago. 

For now, though, Zaha remains focused simply on playing regular, first-team football and will leave any decisions on his future until the end of the season.  

'I'm not ruling anything in or out. I'm just going to play,' he said.
