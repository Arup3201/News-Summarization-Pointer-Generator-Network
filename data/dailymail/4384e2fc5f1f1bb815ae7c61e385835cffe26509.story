Forget coffee, bananas and bio-diversity, for millions of English football fans it was Paulo Wanchope who put Costa Rica on the map.

He collected the ball inside his own half, galloped towards the Stretford End with Phil Neville trailing in pursuit, ate up 60 yards and casually rolled the ball past Peter Schmeichel to put Derby two up at Manchester United.

It was Wanchope’s debut in April 1997 and Derby won the game 3-2. Old Trafford was stunned and a nation reached for its atlases. Within a few months, he was shooting the breeze with the Queen as he began a decade of global adventure featuring London, Manchester and Spain, Qatar, Argentina, Japan and the United States.

These days Wanchope is back home, as assistant manager of the Costa Rica team, plotting a World Cup strategy for the tiny republic of 4.5million people grouped in a World Cup with England, Italy and Uruguay.

‘It was quite shocking when we saw the draw,’ he said. ‘We knew it would be hard but we have three former champions. It is big for us but we love the challenge.

‘Our country will stop. Everyone will watch the games against England and Italy. Everyone is waiting for that moment.’

Wanchope is lean and athletic and looks much as he did 17 years ago even if the knees ache a little more after six operations, as he reflects on the chain reaction which followed his move to England.

‘It changed my life,’ said Wanchope. ‘I look back on my favourite memories like the United game and when we moved to Pride Park, the friendly we played against Barcelona. I met the Queen when she opened the stadium. They told me the Royal Family had been to Costa Rica.’

The story started when he was invited for a trial at QPR. ‘I came over for two weeks when Stewart Houston was the manager,’ he said. ‘I was in a hotel the whole time and that was difficult for me. I made six goals but still no contract. I went back to Costa Rica and came back to Derby a few months later.

‘I didn’t know where Derby was, except it was up north from London. We drove from Heathrow. When I first saw the Baseball Ground — I was expecting something else. But I knew they were going to move to a new stadium.

‘The atmosphere at the club was amazing. Jim Smith was in charge and Steve McClaren was his assistant. Jim was a character, he was crazy, throwing things everywhere. Tea cups, everything went flying in the dressing room.

‘I spoke good English because I’d been in the States. I’d always played football — and I played table tennis for my country — but at High School, from 14, I started playing basketball and gained a scholarship in America from 17 until 19.

‘Everyone was saying “In Costa Rica, what do they play? Is it football or basketball or baseball?” It’s different now. Everyone remembers my goal against United. We’re crazy about football in Costa Rica. It is the biggest sport.’

Derby recorded two top 10 finishes before Wanchope left for West Ham and Manchester City and then his world tour with Malaga, Al-Gharafa, FC Tokyo, Rosario Central, Chicago Fire.

He won his 73rd and final cap for Costa Rica in January 2008, having scored 45 international goals and his next move was to buy a club called Club Sport Uruguay, based in the capital San Jose and playing in the second tier.

‘We got the promotion and then I got the call from the FA to work with the national team,’ said Wanchope. ‘I am gaining experience and maybe I’ll have the chance to come over to England and coach. I would like to be a No 1.’

Costa Rica boss is Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto, a big fan of Jose Mourinho, who will take inspiration from the performances of Los Ticos in Italia ‘90, when they beat Scotland and Sweden before losing 1-0 to Brazil and going out in the next round against Czechoslovakia.

‘We want to emulate that,’ said Wanchope. ‘I can remember watching that on television. There were parties in the streets, everywhere.

‘The world will expect two of England, Italy and Uruguay to get through... but we want to get into the second stage.’

Costa Rica start the World Cup against Uruguay and face England in Belo Horizonte on June 24.

They have been preparing in Colorado and Florida. ‘The most difficult thing will be the temperature,’ added Wanchope. ‘It will be harder for European teams but it will be tough for us.

‘Tactically, we have improved. The coach likes the Italian style. We are a very organised team, difficult to beat. With players like Bryan Ruiz and Joel Campbell, we can always score.’

Hope rests heavily on Ruiz and Campbell, familiar names to English fans. Ruiz is still a Fulham player, although he spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after fans at Craven Cottage turned against him.

‘It was a good move for the national team,’ said Wanchope. ‘The physical aspect in the Premier League has been tough for him but his confidence is coming back.’

Campbell is an Arsenal striker, who has been out on loan in France, Spain and, last season, in Greece, where he scored for Olympiakos  in the Champions League against Manchester United triggering happy memories in Costa Rica.

‘I had a few calls from  England,’ smiled Wanchope. ‘That was special for him. He knows he needs to improve but I’m sure he’ll do well.’
