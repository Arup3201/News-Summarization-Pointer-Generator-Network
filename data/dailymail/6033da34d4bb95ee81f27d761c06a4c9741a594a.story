Splattered with blood, this is the face of a crazed madman who allegedly  battered a betting shop manager to death with a hammer.

The suspected killer was caught on CCTV leaving a branch of Ladbrokes in Morden, south London - which is just next door to a police station - after a botched robbery attempt.

Andrew Iacovou, 55, of North Cheam, Surrey, who had worked for Ladbrokes for 20 years, suffered a fractured skull in the attack at 8am on Saturday and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The father-of-three was believed to 
have been tricked into opening a door, allowing the suspect to force his way
behind the counter where he produced the hammer and carried out the 
attack.

Several customers are understood to 
have gone into the shop after the attack, but did not notice Mr 
Iacovou's body. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as 
blunt trauma to the head.

Mr Iacovou, who lived with his wife Anita, had two sons aged 10 and 13 as well as an older son from a previous relationship.

Paying tribute to Mr Iacovou, his 
neighbour Margaret Murray, 61, said: ‘It is terrible - Andrew was very 
well liked and did a lot for people.  He worshipped his wife and 
children and they adored him.

‘It is such a terrible thing and I 
can't get my head around it. We are such a close community in these 
flats. He was lovely. You would see him going out in the morning and the
kids idolised him.

‘It always 
happens to the nice ones. He was a well-loved man and did a lot of jobs 
for people in the flats. Everybody is devastated. When it happens on 
your doorstep it is unbelievable.’

Ms Murray first became aware of what had happened when police cars pulled up on her road on Saturday afternoon.

She said: ‘I saw the police cars and 
then one of the other ladies told me.  At first I just thought that he 
had had an accident. I just can't believe it.’

Ms Murray said that she believed Mrs 
Iacovou, who has a life-debilitating illness, had gone away with their 
two sons to stay with her brother in nearby New Malden, south-west 
London.

She added: ‘Anita lost her father a couple of months ago, 
which was very hard for her, so I don't know what's going to happen now -
whether she will pack up and go back to India.’

Ladbrokes spokesman Ciaran O'Brien 
said: ‘Ladbrokes can confirm that following a serious incident this 
morning at a shop in Morden a staff member has died.

‘The company's priority at this time 
is to provide the family, to whom we extend our deepest sympathies, with
all the necessary support at this difficult time.

‘We are also providing every required resource to assisting the police in their investigation.’

Mr Iacovou was pronounced dead by 
paramedics at the betting shop shortly after 10.30am on Saturday.  A 
Scotland Yard spokesman said he was apparently attacked in the shop by a
lone male.

Scotland Yard released two images of a
man in a baseball cap they want to speak to about the incident, which 
is being investigated by officers from the Homicide & Serious Crime 
Command.

'At this early stage, it appears the 
deceased was attacked in the shop by a lone male suspect,' a 
Metropolitan Police spokesman said. 'It is not known at this time 
whether any money was taken.

'Members of the public should not approach the man and are advised to contact police immediately.'
