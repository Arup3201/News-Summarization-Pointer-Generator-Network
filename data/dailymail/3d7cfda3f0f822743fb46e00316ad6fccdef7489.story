The world's richest man might seem to have it all, but Bill Gates has one regret. The self-made billionaire said he felt stupid for not knowing any foreign languages.

Speaking in his third Ask Me Anything question-and-answer session for online forum Reddit, the Microsoft founder revealed that he wished he spoke French, Arabic or Chinese.

Speaking in his third Ask Me Anything Q&A on online forum Reddit (above), the Microsoft founder revealed that he wished he spoke French, Arabic or Chinese

He said: 'I took Latin and Greek in high school and got A's and I guess it helps my vocabulary.

'I keep hoping to get time to study one of these - probably French because it is the easiest. I did Duolingo for a while but didn't keep it up.'

Gates, who is worth $79.3billion, praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for stunning an audience in Beijing when he spoke fluent Mandarin.

He said: 'Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Mandarin and did a Q&A with Chinese students - incredible.'

Owner of a mansion worth more than $120million in his hometown of Medina, Washington, Gates' admission over language is not the first time he has given insight into his domestic habits and personal insights.

The 30-year-old founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, shocked an audience when he broke out in fluent Mandarin during a Q&A last October.

A self-made billionaire worth $33.6billion, Zuckerberg learned the language partly because his wife's grandmother only speaks Chinese. 

He married Chinese-American Priscilla Chan in 2012, and set himself the goal of learning Mandarin in 2010.

He said China is a great country and hopes that learning the language will help him learn its culture.

Last February, Gates said he likes to do the dishes himself - to his own exacting standards every night and shared the eyebrow-raising revelation that his wife, Melinda, would likely want Samuel L Jackson to play her husband in a biopic.

He also admitted that he would pick up a $100 bill if he found it on the street.

During the session yesterday, the 59-year-old said that he loves BBQ sauce but avoids it before TV appearances because he tends to spill it, his biggest splurge is having a private jet and he enjoys Indian and Thai food.

He also revealed who he is rooting for in the upcoming Superbowl, which he said should be no surprise.

'This is an easy question. I am good friends with Paul Allen who owns the Seahawks and I live in Seattle,' he wrote. 'The playoff game was amazing to watch. Go Seahawks!'

As he took the top spot on Forbes 28th Annual Billionaires list last year for the fourth time, he said he is pretty basic when it comes to spending on clothes and food, but that he enjoys investing in shoes and racquets for when he plays tennis.

Gates, 59, said he really likes his dog Oreo and Nilla, pictured, when they are not barking at night and eating things they are not supposed to

When asked a life lesson he had to learn the hard way, the generous philanthropist said staying up too late is a habit he is still trying to break.

'Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem,' he said.

He shared that he had two dogs, Oreo and Nilla, which he likes when they are not barking at night.

'I will say I spend less time with the dogs than the kids do but I really like them (when they are not barking at night and not eating things they are not supposed to and when they are well house trained),' he said. 'I have resisted getting a third dog.' 

The father-of-three, who revealed last year that he was not going to leave trust funds to his children, was asked if he could still leap over chairs as he did during a television interview in 1994.

During the meeting, he is seen leaping over the chair from a standing position, but now he said it does not come as easy as it did then.

Gates said: 'A shorter chair every decade I am afraid.'

He also said that his favourite spreads on bread include peanut butter, butter and cheese.
