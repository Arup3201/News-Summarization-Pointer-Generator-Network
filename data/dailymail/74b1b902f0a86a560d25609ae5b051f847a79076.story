Sergio Aguero returned from international duty with Argentina to training with Manchester City ahead of the Premier League champion's showdown with Arsenal on Saturday.

Aguero was on the scoresheet as Argentina gained revenge for their World Cup final defeat to Germany with a 4-2 friendly win in Dusseldorf - where his new Manchester rival Angel di Maria played a starring role.
