Documents show that crime tsar Shaun Wright knew in advance about the scale of the child abuse 

The crime tsar defying calls for his resignation over the Rotherham child grooming scandal came under fresh pressure to quit last night after The Mail on Sunday uncovered damning proof that he ignored a mass of evidence of abuse.

Shaun Wright, the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, has claimed the scale of the crisis was a ‘huge surprise’ to him after a report revealed at least 1,400 girls in Rotherham were abused by gangs of predominantly Asian men.

But a dossier of more than 20 files provides powerful evidence that in his former post as cabinet member for children’s services in Rotherham, Mr Wright must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse.

Minutes from Rotherham’s Safeguarding Children Board (SCB) – which would have been passed to him – reveal that:

lThere was frustration among agencies about the difficulties in holding to account those adults who organised or took part in the sexual exploitation of children.

lThere were not enough resources to cope with the level of need.

Last night, David Greenwood, a solicitor representing 15 of the victims, said Mr Wright should resign immediately. ‘The figures were available to him and I fail to see how he could have been unaware of the scale,’ he said.

A council source added: ‘These minutes would have passed across Wright’s desk without any question. Did he read them? If he didn’t, he should have done. And whether he did or not, he should hang his head in shame and resign.’

Mr Wright has quit the Labour Party but has refused demands to leave his £85,000-a-year PCC post.

The dossier of quarterly minutes from the SCB – made up of education, health, police and social workers – charts the growth of grooming and predatory behaviour to near-epidemic proportions throughout the five years that Mr Wright was Rotherham’s cabinet member for children’s services, from 2005 until 2010. Although his attendance at the quarterly SCB meetings was not compulsory, it was part of the board’s responsibility to pass the minutes on to him – and part of his to read them.

Sections of a dossier which shows that Shaun Wright was alerted to the scale of the scandal in Rotherham

Documents show between 2007 and 2010 alone, the number of sexually exploited children – mostly girls – coming to the notice of social services and youth workers each year increased more than tenfold from 45 to 483.

Our evidence also shows that over five years the problem of sexual exploitation was frequently discussed, and that the rapidly growing scale of the problem was readily apparent.

In the minutes and attached reports seen by The Mail on Sunday, the overwhelming magnitude of the problem is obvious as the numbers of young people in contact with either council staff or the specialist outreach youth workers of a group called Risky Business, grows out of control.

Last night, Mr Wright failed to respond to messages. His spokeswoman said he was ‘unavailable’.
