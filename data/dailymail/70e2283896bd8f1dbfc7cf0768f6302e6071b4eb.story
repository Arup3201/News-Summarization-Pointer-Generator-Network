Clever immigrants have found a new way across the US - Mexico border.

Droves of Mexican migrants have been able to cross the border by using key words and specific phrases that compel US Customs and Border Patrol agents to let them into the country as refugees.

This strategy is new and appears to be well-organized, according to ABC 10.

Loophole: Mexicans are gaining entry to the US by the hundreds using key words and phrases

At least 199 Mexicans were allowed through the Otay crossing in San Diego and into the US just on August 5, according to a border agent who spoke with the station.

‘They are being told if they come across, when they come up to the border and they say certain words, they will be allowed into the country,’ the border agent said, adding ‘we are being overwhelmed’ to the point overflows were being shipped by van to nearby San Ysidro station.

The latest strategy by immigrants to gain entry to the US appears to be quite successful.

'This appears to be a well-orchestrated attempt by whoever that makes our system even more ridiculous than it has been in the past,’ immigration expert Pete Nunez told the station.

Families and groups of immigrants have been telling border agents they come from central Mexican areas ravaged by drug cartel violence – such as Michoacan or Sinaloa – and saying ‘cartels are ripping their state apart,’ the ‘credible fear’ affords them special treatment, according to the station.

The groups are given a court date to prove their claim and bonded into the local community, a source told the station, but they never return.

‘There are no detention facilities for families so the family would have to be split up. We don't want to split families up, so we end up releasing people out into the community on bond, on bail,’ Nunez said, calling the tactic a ‘huge loop hole.’

Even more incredibly, the station found evidence of immigrants being coached from within Mexico on how to sell the ruse, exactly what to say and how to act, as well as a $300 video instructing immigrants on the ins and outs of fooling agents.

A black-market for selling the scheme has sprung up almost overnight, according to the station.

Multiple efforts by MailOnline to contact different spokespersons with the CBP were unsuccessful, but a US Citizenship and Immigration Services official explained to ABC 10 why immigrants are allowed into the country based on a credible fear claim.

‘Any individual who asserts a fear of persecution or torture or an intention to seek asylum during the course of the expedited removal process is referred to an USCIS asylum officer for an interview to determine if the individual has a credible fear of persecution or torture,’ Christopher Bentley told the station.

‘The USCIS officer must find that a ‘significant possibility’ exists that the individual may be found eligible for asylum or withholding of removal,’ Bentley added, ‘if the credible fear threshold is met, the individual is placed into removal proceedings in Immigration Court, where the individual may apply for relief from removal, including asylum’ and be allowed into the country while awaiting their court date.

A border agent told the station that ‘there has to be a policy change, something implemented, an emergency implication that will stop this, or otherwise we will have thousands coming in, into the United States.’

It is not known if immigrants are using this strategy at border crossings in other states.
