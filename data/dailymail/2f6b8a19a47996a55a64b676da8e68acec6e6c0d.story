Police arrived on scene on Friday to find Glynn horribly injured by the falling tree. She was pronounced dead the next day

The Chicago Tribune reports the storm's winds were so powerful a tree was uprooted and sent crashing into Glynn's path.

Foust called 911 and police responded to the scene at approximately 3:40 p.m.

'She's gone,' Foust wrote on Facebook early Saturday, according to NBC Chicago.

'I couldn't save her.'

Besides recognition across the Chicago theater community for her regular appearances on prestigious stages such as Steppenwolf, Writers, Next, Chicago Shakespeare, and Northlight, she gained national attention with television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire.'

Glynn was remembered as 'a beautiful woman and one would think that she would only be a leading 
lady, but the truth is she also had great skill and breadth and scope as
 an actress,' said Northlight Theatre artistic director BJ Jones in a statement to the The Chicago Tribune.

Friends and family of the actress are now attempting to raise money to pay for medical and funeral expenses, along with a support and trust fund for he husband and two children. You can donate here.

'In a cast she was a strong, stabilizing influence.  A real pillar in the cast. And when she walked on stage, you knew you were in good hands. You knew that you were seeing the truest colors of the character and the play,' he added.

She was especially known for playing strong women.

One of her most impressive roles was as a wife dealing with her husband's infidelity in the 2003 Steppenwolf Garage production of 'Orange Flower Water.'

Theater critic Chris Jones singled Glynn out in a review of the 2012 production of 'Homecoming 1972' where she played as waitress.

'Much of the acting is strong. Glynn, for example, takes that diner waitress, a tricky assignment indeed, and fleshes her out in all 
kinds of unexpected ways, layering the character with levels of pain, 
desire and resilience.'

Actor Jeff Still wrote a touching tribute to her on Facebook.

'Chicago, and the world, has lost one sassy, lovely, talented redhead. I
 can't pretend I knew her better than I did, but anyone who is or has 
been a part of the great theatre community of Chicago knows it's a very 
tight-knit group, and we all swim in the same pool,' he wrote.

'My heart goes out to Joe, and all of their family, and all of my 
brothers and sisters in the Chicago theatre community, especially those 
who knew Molly well. And my heart goes out to all of us, as this kind of
 death is always a sobering, shattering reminder of how fragile all our 
lives are.

All we can do today is appreciate each other a little more, 
hug each other for no reason, love each other a little tighter, because 
the cold, cold fact is that none of us are guaranteed any time. In the 
words of Thornton Wilder, 'A star's mighty good company.' And in the 
words of William Saroyan, 'in the time of your life ... Live.' Molly 
sure did.'
