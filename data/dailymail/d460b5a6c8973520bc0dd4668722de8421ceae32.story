An Australian woman, who hit back at a phone scammer claiming to be a Telstra employee, has shared her hilarious prank in an effort to warn others. 

Samantha Gear, from Devonport in Tasmania, explained that she was fed up with constantly receiving phone calls from scammers and decided to advise others about the money thieving calls. 

'There is always either an unknown transaction on my credit card or my computer has been compromised. Which are all lies,' Ms Gear wrote in the caption of her six minute video.

'Every time I receive [a call], I play their little games too'.

Fed up with receiving phone calls from scammers, Samantha Gear from Devonport in Tasmania recorded a conversation with a man claiming to be from Telstra and pranked him for revenge 

The footage shows Ms Gear with her home phone in her hand from which a male's voice instructs her on how to fix her computer. 

'Press down the window button and the letter R together at the same time. Press it and then release it. You might be getting a box on the computer screen,' the man says.

Determined to make the scammer's job as difficult as possible, Ms Gear plays dumb. 

'But, I'm using an iPad,' she tells her caller, to which a confused male's voice replies: 'But, how is this possible ma'am?' 

'You said to go to my computer and I only have an iPad,' Ms Gear is heard saying. 

During the call, she frustrated the scammer by telling him she has an iPad instead of a computer and offers to pay him with her library card

After confirming with her that she has no computers at all, the scammer can be heard mumbling in a confused manner before finding a different 'problem' that Ms Gear requires urgent assistance with. 

'Alright then what we are going to do now… we are going to send you a technician urgently and he will diagnose the problem of your internet as well as your iPad, alright?' the scammer says. 'So now for the technician charge, you need to pay a… payment of $3 alright?'

He then requests that Ms Gear read out the digits printed on her 'plastic card' only to be told that she doesn't own a credit card. 

Using his last resort, the man threatens to disconnect both Ms Gear's internet and her phone connection until she finds a method of paying

Instead, Ms Gear offers to pay the fee in cheque form, with the coins in her pocket or even by using her library card.

Clearly frustrated, the man is heard requesting a Visa or MasterCard before impatiently saying: 'you can use any one of your plastic cards… as soon as possible. I'm holding the line for you. Just bring it.'

Using his last resort, the man threatens to disconnect both Ms Gear's internet and her phone connection until she finds a method of paying.

Ms Gear's video ends with the warning, 'please educate your friends and family of these calls. Never do anything they ask you to do'.
