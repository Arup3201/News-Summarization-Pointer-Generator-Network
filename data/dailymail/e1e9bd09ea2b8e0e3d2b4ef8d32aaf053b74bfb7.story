Arrest: Will Hayden, from Sons of Guns, was arrested on Saturday but posted bond

The star of reality TV show Sons of Guns has been arrested for child molestation - but he insists the claims are the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend.

William Hayden, 49, whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was arrested in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Saturday on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature.

The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff's website.

While the case has been sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl.

He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship.

Hayden has since married and is bringing up the girl with his new wife. The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services.

His older daughter Stephanie, who appears on Sons of Guns beside him, said that her father was innocent.

'There was never any impropriety in our home,' she said. 'He was and is a good father.'

On the show: Hayden (second left) is the star of Sons of Guns, which first aired on Discovery in 2011. It follows Hayden's company, which manufactures and sells custom guns in Louisiana

On Monday, she took to Facebook to defend her father.

'This
 was a false allegation and unfortunately that's all it takes,' she 
wrote. 'My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very 
much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our 
family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family...

'The
 one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that 
anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare...please stand 
with us.'

Sons of 
Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and follows Hayden's 
life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms, in Louisiana. Stephanie manages the office for the company.

It's
 not his first brush with the law; in 2009, Hayden - a former Marine - 
was investigated over ten unregistered guns by the U.S. Department of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Support: Hayden's daughter Stephanie, who also appears on the show, said her dad (right) was a good father

Defense: Stephanie took to Facebook on Monday afternoon to defend her father and said that her younger sister was 'heartbroken' by the claims made against their father

Then in 
2013, relatives filed a lawsuit against him, claiming he and his ex-wife
 had previously given them shares in the company - before transferring 
part of the company to a new name and rendering the shares worthless, Business Report reported.

But his attorney argued that he had transferred some of the business to comply with the ATF and federal regulations regarding automatic firearms and had never intended to deceive anyone.

East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's office refused to comment on this latest case, saying it had been sealed by a judge.
