The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are about to embark on a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia with eight-month old Prince George. And now a luxury travel company is offering its customers the chance to follow in the Royal couple’s footsteps on a VIP trip Down Under.

The month-long tour of Australia costs a cool £341,000 per couple and includes first-class flights, chauffeured limousines, a trip on a private yacht - and a £10,200 diamond dummy for your little prince or princess.

Getting the Royal treatment: The trip includes the chance to travel to lunch by seaplane

Room with a view: You'll stay in the lap of luxury at the Lizard Island resort near the Great Barrier Reef

The luxury schedule has been devised by VeryFirstTo.com and tour operator Bridge & Wickers and includes visits to Sydney, Adelaide, the Blue Mountains and Uluru (Ayers Rock) – all destinations that feature on William and Kate's itinerary.

Other stop-offs include Melbourne, Tasmania, Hamilton Island, The Daintree Rainforest, Kangaroo island, Kakadu National Park and the famous Barossa Valley.

The lucky sightseers will explore the Great Barrier Reef islands by private yacht, view the country’s stunning scenery by helicopter, travel between locations within the country on privately chartered aircrafts - and even fly to lunch by seaplane.

They'll also enjoy private wine 
tastings and guided ‘walkabouts’, along with a behind-the-scenes tour of
 the Sydney Opera House and Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, where the Royal party 
will visit the bilby enclosure, which is being named after Prince 
George.

David Wickers, founder of Bridge 
& Wickers said: ‘Included in the itinerary will be a selection of 
Australia’s most wow-inducing experiences, from a performance at the 
Sydney Opera House to private guided ‘walkabouts’ in the oldest 
rainforest on the planet, the great Aussie Outback and the sacred 
Aboriginal lands in Crocodile Dundee’s Kakadu National Park.

‘And with intimate tastings with wine 
makers, spa treatments and behind the scenes private tours of, for 
example, the Sydney Opera House and Sydney’s Taronga Zoo (where the 
Royal party will visit the bilby enclosure which is being named after 
Prince George) every day will be a new adventure.'

Couples who decided to take their toddler on the trip with them will also receive some very exclusive baby gifts to compliment their new luxury lifestyle.

Marcel Knobil founder of VeryFirstTo explains: ‘If, like Kate and Wills, you 
bring along your little prince or princess, the trip includes a 
Tiffany's sterling silver baby cup (£385), a Prada baby bag (£780) and a
 stunning white gold and 3ct diamond dummy (£10,200).’

Eight-month-old Prince George will be the centre of attention when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tour New Zealand and Australia next month.

Instead of travelling from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra.

The couple will fly to Wellington on April 7 where George will be seen for the first time coming off their plane.

The tour will begin in earnest on April 9
 when the little prince undertakes his first official engagement at 
Government House and the Royal couple will visit Auckland, Dunedin, 
Christchurch, Queenstown and the Waikato region of the North Island 
before travelling to Australia on April 16.

Seasoned traveller: The trip won't be the first time Prince George has flown on a plane - he recently travelled to St Vincent in the West Indies with his mum

Baby bling: The holiday includes a white gold and three carat diamond dummy which costs £10,200

Rock star: The VIP itinerary includes a visit to Uluru (Ayers Rock) where William and Kate will attend a 'welcome to country' ceremony

Taste of the good life: The tour will include private wine tastings in Australia's famous Barossa Valley

The family’s first stop in Australia is Sydney where they will spend the majority of their nine-day visit but will also take in the stunning Blue Mountains, recently razed by bushfires.

The trip includes a stop-over at Ayers Rock in Australia, or Uluru as it is known by the 
Aboriginal population, where they will enjoy a ‘welcome to country’ 
ceremony at the Uluru Cultural Centre before attending afternoon tea 
with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

The Royal couple will also visit Manly Beach to celebrate the work of Australia’s world famous lifeguards and Brisbane to attend a reception hosted by the Governor and Premier of Queensland for local young people.

They will then travel to Adelaide and Canberra where they will attend a reception at Parliament House hosted by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
