Thirteen people have been killed at one of Pakistan's last pornographic cinemas after three grenades were thrown into the audience.

About 80 people were in the cinema as it reportedly screened an X-rated film midway through the afternoon when one grenade hit the main door and two more landed inside the building.

Twenty more people were wounded as blood ran down the aisles of the auditorium. One man was decapitated in his seat by the blast.

Blood-soaked shoes, caps, condoms and 
human flesh were found following the attack, which a witness said happened while a pornographic film was being 
screened at around 4pm.

The Shama cinema was the last place to
 watch pornographic films publicly in the northwestern city of Peshawar,
 a battleground for Taliban extremists.

The cinema is famous for being one of the last places in Pakistan to defy the strict moral codes demanded by the Taliban, upon pain of threats or death.

Attack: The cinema's location

Though it has a main auditorium for mainstream films, the official public face of the cinema, it is notorious for its smaller, 30-year-old screen showing X-rated films three times a day.

Men are known to cover their faces as they slip into the back of the theatre in a cloud of cannabis smoke, reportedly paying a special 'Class X' price of 200 rupees (£1.15) to sneak down a concrete passage past an armed guard.

In the centre of a city of two and a half million people, the cinema had already been threatened and its owners had been told to put up metal detectors but did not follow the advice, CNN reported.

Various reports put the death toll between 10 and 13.

No one has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attack, which came days after Pakistan began a peace process with the 
Taliban to end years of violence which has killed more than 40,000 people.

One recent film at the Shama's
 backroom, Dostana ('Friendship'), was a cheaply-made romantic drama 
made in Pakistan about a hero who cannot decide to marry his sweetheart 
or his arranged bride.

So he 'tests' his brides-to-be to see which is the best, with much of the feature-length film occupied with graphic sex scenes.

Aftermath: Inside the cinema journalists and police inspect the damage as blood stains the auditorium floor

Deaths: The attack was the second on a cinema in Peshawar in less than two weeks

Much of the pornography shown at the cinema is in Pashto, the regional language, as was the film reportedly being shown at the time of yesterday's attack.

The attack came just nine days after another on the city's Picture House cinema, which killed four people and wounded 31 more, and less than two years after the Shama was burned down and reopened.

Islamist extremists see cinemas as an example of sinful indulgence or bowing to Western ideas of entertainment.

The fear of being seen in public at the cinema along with the rise of DVDs and downloads means there are almost no cinemas left in Peshawar, once a film capital known half-jokingly as Pollywood.

Fewer than 10 remain, and even they are being destroyed by extremists or knocked down and turned into shopping centres.

One conservative political party, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), has previously demanded the cinema should be shut down - but its owners, the Bilour family, are influential in the rival Pashtun nationalist ANP party.

Some observers point to that as one explanation why the cinema may have defied strict government censorship for so long.
