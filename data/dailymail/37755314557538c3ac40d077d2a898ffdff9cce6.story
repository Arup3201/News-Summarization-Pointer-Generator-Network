UEFA president Michel Platini is preparing a crackdown on bad behaviour by players in a bid to eradicate the intimidation of officials from European competitions.

Platini fears future generations of footballers and fans will be put off the game by scenes such as those of nine Chelsea players pressuring Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off PSG’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Unlike the FA, UEFA do not have specific guidelines covering incidents of crowding the referee or a system of punishments, but they are looking into it.

UEFA spokesman Pedro Pinto said: ‘The UEFA president has recently been more concerned about the behaviour of players on the pitch. 

'We would like to see an environment where players would accept the decisions taken and where they would not employ the tactic of pressure and intimidation of the officials during the game.

‘There is a strong interest internally to look at specific initiatives and campaigns, and possibly regulations that would have an impact on the behaviour of players.

‘It is not a good example for fans, for future players or for the image of the game.’

The FA have the power to fine clubs if they are guilty of mass confrontation or intimidating the match officials.

Chelsea admitted a charge of surrounding referee Jon Moss during a game against Everton earlier this month and were warned about their future conduct.
