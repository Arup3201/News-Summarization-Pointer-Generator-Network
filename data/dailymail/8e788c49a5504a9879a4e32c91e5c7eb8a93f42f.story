A Massachusetts pharmacy has agreed to pay $100million to settle claims from a deadly 2012 meningitis outbreak.

New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc of Framingham, was sued after at least 64 people died and 751 fell ill across 20 states late last year. All the infections stemmed from an NECC-made steroid injection, authorities said.

The settlement was announced Monday, but still requires court approval, according to Reuters.

Back pain drug methylprednisolone acetate was the culprit, and it was tainted before it ever left NECC, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The tainted vials were shipped around the country and administered to patients suffering chronic back pain.

The compounding pharmacy saw the writing on the wall as infections began to mount and filed for bankruptcy just days before Christmas last year, according to documents.

The terms of the settlement allowed NECC to deny any wrongdoing, but was hailed to Reuters as ‘a big step forward in getting justice for victims’ by lawyer for the victims Thomas Sobol.

‘We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak,’ bankruptcy trustee Paul Moore added.

The money to settle the claims is expected to come from the owners, insurers, tax refunds and the sale of another business.
