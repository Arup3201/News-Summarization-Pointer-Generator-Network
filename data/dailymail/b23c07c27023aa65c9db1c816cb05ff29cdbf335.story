Danny Ocean might not give them many points for drama.

But when it came to success, two conmen in Australia were very much on the money – £20million of it, to be precise.

The tricksters stole the astonishing sum from a casino with nothing more complicated than a £3 earpiece and a computer.

The Crown casino in Melbourne is said to have lost $32million in a hi-tech heist

Bosses believe that a helper gained remote access to the venue's security camera and were then able to tell the high roller how to bet based on other players' hands of cards

They used the building’s own security cameras to pull off one of the biggest-known casino stings ever.
And while it lacked the pyrotechnics of heist film Ocean’s Eleven, it was planned just as carefully.

The fake punter, who is not thought 
to be Australian, had staked out the Crown Casino in Melbourne, where he
was known to staff as a ‘whale’ – a gambler who bets huge sums.

On the night of the sting he was allowed much sought-after access to the casino’s VIP high rollers’ room.

The player is believed to have left Australia and returned home while a member of staff assigned to VIPs has been sacked

After playing just eight hands of 
poker he scooped the table and made a fortune – courtesy of the casino’s
own high-tech security cameras, which can watch every hand held by a 
gambler and record every card played.

As usual, the images were carefully monitored in a separate room, and nothing untoward was spotted. 

But the gambler’s seemingly 
telepathic skill – and his huge win – aroused suspicion, and casino 
bosses called in security experts.

Meanwhile, the man was allowed to 
cash his winnings and return to his £1,000-a-night quarters on the 
executive floors of the Crown Towers, where he was staying with his 
family. 

Staff soon discovered that remote access to the VIP room’s security system ‘had been given to an unauthorised person’.

The conman’s partner was watching 
images from the hidden cameras monitoring the gaming table, and telling 
him what hands the other players were holding via his earpiece.  

Staff confronted the man in the middle of the night, and ordered him and his family out of the building.

The casino claims he has left the 
country – but refuses to reveal why the foreign gambler was allowed to 
go with his illegal winnings. Police said no official complaint had been
made.

According to reports, he has been banned from the casino, and a member of staff who looked after VIP guests has been sacked.

The heist has been compared to 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, starring George Clooney, left, and Brad Pitt

Tips: In the Hollywood comedy-crime caper film the crew of conmen also relied on infiltrating the security system at the Bellagio casino to fool the manager Terry Benedict played by Andy Garcia

A spokesman claimed the casino was confident of recovering a significant portion of the stolen money.

Barron Stringfellow, a US-based 
security consultant, said: ‘The problem with casinos is that they think 
they’re unbeatable but we see over and over again that they’re not. It’s
very easy to intercept the signal [of the security cameras] from many 
casinos that don’t take proper precautions.'

Ocean’s
Eleven was released in 2001. The film stars George Clooney as Danny 
Ocean, a conman who plans to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously 
in an elaborate heist.
