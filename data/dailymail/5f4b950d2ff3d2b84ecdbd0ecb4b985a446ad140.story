Two teenager burglars were caught breaking into the home of the town's police chief just days after the area was ranked as one of the safest places to live in the United States.

Conner Hinton, 17, and Taylor Nuttal, 17, from Sugar Land, Texas, broke into the flat of Police Chief Doug Brinkley.

The teenagers were arrested after a neighbour saw them climbing over a fence and called the police.

Crime target: Texan Police Chief Doug Brinkley

Officers found a back door had been forced open and several boards missing from the fence. They arrested the teenagers after finding them in a vehicle nearby.

Police spokesman Doug Adolph said nothing was missing from the address in Holly Glade Lane. The burglars had targeted the property at around 11.45am on February 8th.

Hinton and Nuttal are charged with burglary of a habitation and have admitted the offence.

Police Chief Brinkley, 48, who was just five blocks away at the time, and told The Huffington Post: 'They just chose my house.

'I wouldn't want to see them end in prison for the rest of their lives, but unfortunately that;s where they're heading with behaviour like this.'

He added he is considering putting up surveillance cameras at his home and installing a safe, and said:Â  'You never know who's house you're breaking into and you never know what could happen.'

The break-in came after Sugar Land was ranked second in Texas in a list of the safest cities in the U.S., complied by CQ Press City Crime Rankings.
