Arsenal's German stars have had a summer to remember after lifting the World Cup in Brazil - but now Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker are back in North London and ready for the Premier League.

The trio played a pivotal role in Germany winning their fourth World Cup in July but they are now concentrating on further success for Arsenal, who lifted the Community Shield on Sunday.

They posted a photo on Instagram in their Arsenal training kits, accompanied with the caption: 'We are back! #afc #london #arsenal #merte #poldi #ozil.'
