Spending on the security services could be merged with the defence budget to hit a key Nato target, David Cameron indicated yesterday.

The Prime Minister is under intense pressure from both his own MPs and former generals to guarantee that the Conservatives will continue to spend at least 2 per cent of Britain’s national income on defence.

A study published yesterday revealed that Britain will miss the target by more than £2billion next year if current spending plans are maintained.

Missing this figure would be deeply embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who lectured other Western leaders on the need to maintain defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales last year.

But he indicated that he could hit the target by re-badging the £2billion budget for the security services as defence spending. 

Prime Minister David Cameron is under fire over claims Britain will fail to meet its Nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of its national income on defence next year

He told LBC radio: ‘I have a responsibility to make sure we make the right decisions about defence and other security spending.

‘I look at these things in the round, so I am also concerned about the budget for MI5, the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ, counter-terrorism policing. To me all of these things are part of our national defence.’

A study by the impartial House of Commons Library yesterday revealed that Britain will need to spend an additional £2.2billion on defence next year in order to hit the target – and an extra £1billion every year after that.

It added that current plans suggest defence spending will otherwise represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year.

But former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth condemned the move as a ‘complete cop-out’. 

An RAF Typhoon fighter jets was scrambled to escort a Russian Bear bomber when it flew into UK airspace last month. There are fears a defence funding squeeze would leave the UK reluctant to tackle such incursions

He said last night: ‘No amount of fancy footwork or creative accountancy is going to fool anybody. Adding the security budget to defence will not produce a single extra bullet or soldier.

‘It doesn’t address the fundamental problem that the UK and our allies face very real threats – a resurgent Russia, complete turmoil in the Middle East and many other threats around the world.

'If this idea goes ahead it will be seen by all for the gimmick that it is.’

Mr Cameron has faced repeated attacks over defence spending from former military leaders.

The former head of the army, General Sir Peter Wall, warned that the funding squeeze was leaving the UK reluctant to tackle Russian incursions into its airspace and offshore waters.

Another former Army chief, Lord Dannatt, said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for a Conservative government to fail to meet its commitments on defence.

Mr Cameron yesterday showed his irritation at the comments – suggesting that some vocal critics were speaking out in order to promote their memoirs.

He said: ‘Obviously they have their own book to talk – sometimes quite literally a book to talk – and sometimes they just want to make their views known.’

Tory rebels plan to force a Commons vote on defence spending tomorrow. Many are angered Mr Cameron has pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of our income on foreign aid, but will not make a firm commitment to meet the Nato target.
