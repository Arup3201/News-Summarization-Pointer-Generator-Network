Martin O’Neill has offered his full and unreserved backing to Roy Keane after an alleged row with a fan at the team hotel in Dublin.

Reports that the Ireland assistant manager was involved in a bust-up outside the bar area in the Portmarnock hotel quickly spread on Wednesday night.

But Keane’s boss has leapt to his defence in a video statement published on the FAI’s website on Thursday morning.

‘The FAI and I have been fully briefed on the circumstances of what happened at the team hotel last night,’ O’Neill read.

‘Roy asked that the Gardai (police) be called and has notified them of what happened.

‘While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point.

‘However, I can say that after being made aware of the facts that Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI and John Delaney (FAI chief executive).’

Although Ireland officials - and now their manager - have moved to back their man, it is hardly ideal preparation for Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow.

O’Neill added: ‘We are now focused - as we have been all week - on the game in hand and won’t be saying anything more about this issue.’

The FAI were quick to refute the claims on Wednesday, stating that reports surrounding a bust-up were ‘inaccurate’ and revealed that Keane himself had notified the Gardai of the incident.

According to well-placed sources in the Ireland camp, the incident was blown out of proportion and contrary to social media rumours, no players were involved.

Gardai confirmed they had attended, but that no arrest or complaint had been made.

It is understood that CCTV cameras were operating in the area of the hotel in which the exchange took place.

In a statement released late on Wednesday night, the FAI said: ‘Following inaccurate media reports which refer to an incident involving a member of the public this evening at the Republic of Ireland team hotel, we wish to clarify that Roy Keane called the Gardai following the incident.’

O'Neill will be without James McCarthy for the trip to Scotland as they press ahead in a quest to reach France in two years' time. 

The Republic currently sit joint top of Group D along with Poland after taking seven of the first nine points on offer, the last of them from a creditable 1-1 draw with world champions Germany in Gelsenkirchen last month.

A positive result against the Scots would raise confidence further as they attempt to secure one of the two automatic qualification places up for grabs.
