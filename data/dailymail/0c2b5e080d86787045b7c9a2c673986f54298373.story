Former adviser to Tony Blair and current Save The Children chief executive was among nine at the charity awarded £160,000 in bonuses

Executives at one of the UK’s most prominent international aid charities were handed bonuses worth more than £160,000 last year.

Save the Children increased performance-related pay to executives by a third compared to the previous year, a move that could prove controversial following criticism of the huge pay-packets enjoyed by charity bosses.

The charity’s chief executive Justin Forsyth, a former advisor to Tony Blair, was among nine Save the Children executives handed the bonus in 2012.

It was revealed earlier this week that Mr Forsyth earned a salary of £163,000, which is now known to include £22,560 in performance-related pay.

He is one of six staff at the 14 charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) that earn more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary.

The revelation prompted the International Development Secretary Justine Greening to say that the finances of major aid organisations - which receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers - must be open to scrutiny.

William Shawcross, the chairman of the Charity Commission, also said that ‘disproportionate’ salaries in the face of decreasing charitable donations from the public risked ‘bringing the charitable world into disrepute’.

Save the Children paid its executives £120,000 in performance-related pay in 2011 but said that Mr Forsyth declined the money due to being ‘relatively new’ in his role.

The payments increased significantly to £162,000 last year after the company ‘restructured’ the way it offered bonuses.

The charity said the payments encouraged the ‘very best’ from staff and helped to ‘save the lives of more of the world’s poorest children’.

Three staff at Save the Children earn more than £140,000. The highest is chief operating officer Annabel Hoult who earned £168,653 last year.

The revelation prompted Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke to describe the bonuses as ‘inappropriate and objectionable’.

The public administration select committee member told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Out-of-control salaries for charities risk bringing the voluntary sector into disrepute.

‘Volunteers who are paid nothing will rightly ask why charities are paying bonuses like they are some kind of bank or big multinational.’

A spokesman for Save the Children said: ‘Save the Children does not run a bonus pool for its senior executives. Instead, all staff pay increases are related to performance, and the salaries of our executive directors contain a performance related element.

‘Last year, we restructured the way we allocate this performance related pay, standardising it across the executive directors after taking advice from an expert remuneration agency, Towers Watson.

‘Nine members of staff are covered by executive directors performance related pay. The performance related portions of directors salaries totalled approximately £120,000 in 2011.

‘In 2011, Justin chose not to take the performance related portion of is salary, as he was relatively new as CEO.’

The spokesman said that 20 per cent of executive’s salaries are performance related and are determined by 20 performance indicators.  

The DEC, which brings together aid organisations to raise money quickly for the victims of natural disasters, has been singled out for particular criticism as high earners do not need to be identified in its annual accounts.

Charities working for the fund rely on public funds, having received more than £1.1billion over the past three years from the Government, the United Nations and the EU.

The top salary of £184,000 was given to British Red Cross chief executive Sir Nick Young, who is a former city lawyer.

There are 186 staff earning over £60,000 - a 16 per cent rise in three years, while the number on six figure salaries has risen from 22 in 2010 to 30 last year.
