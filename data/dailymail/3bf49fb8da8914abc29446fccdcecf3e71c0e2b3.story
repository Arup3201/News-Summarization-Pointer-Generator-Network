Not everyone agrees with the phrase - 'the more the merrier', as organisers have cancelled a property development's first launch party because too many people confirmed attendance.

Mirvac and UrbanGrowth, the property development's organisers, cancelled Tuesday's cocktail event for the launch of Green Square located in the inner-south of Sydney.

After receiving 'overwhelming success' and 'overwhelming interest', the organisers sent  an email to guest just one week before the party, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Green Square is set to contain approximately 2000 apartments, 14,000-square-metres of retail space and around 50,000-square-metres of office space

'A surprisingly high volume of acceptances to the event from stakeholders, supporters and friends of Green Square has seen guest numbers exceed both our expectations and the capacity of the venue,' the email read.

'We plan to host the event in early 2015 to allow us to accommodate the large number of guests interested in experiencing all that Green Square has to offer.'

Green Square is set to contain approximately 2000 apartments, 14,000-square-metres of retail space and around 50,000-square-metres of office space. 

The development hopes to see hundreds of new families relocating to the Green Square town centre, with already having an overwhelming level of interest for one, two and three bedroom apartments, The Australian reports. 

'Green Square has been conceived from a very different urban design perspective,' said Brett Draffen, Mirvac chief investment officer.

'All the fundamentals that contribute to a healthy and sustainable lifestyle have been considered. Residents have ready access to Green Square Train Station.

'Sydney will need to accommodate another 1.7 million people by 2030 and to do so, housing density, in locations close to infrastructure will need to increase.'

But it seems like both Mirvac Group and UrbanGrowth are not quite ready for the overwhelming response from interested parties. 

After spending around $45,000 for the event, John Carfi, executive of residential apartment at Mirvac Group justified his reason to postbone event.

'In the scheme of the sales and marketing process for this development, [the cost is] not significant,' he said. 

Organisers estimated that only 500 people would join the launch party at Eveleigh's Australia Technology Park.

Neither UrbanGrowth or Mirvac has mentioned how many people RSVP-ed yes to the event but according to Mr Carfi, organisers were not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. 

'I've lost count, to be honest. We're certainly well over what we anticipated,' said Mr Carfi.  

He said he did not want to 'underwhelm people' and give off a bad first impression. 

'That was probably the bigger risk for us,'he said.
