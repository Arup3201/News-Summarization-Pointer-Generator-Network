The birth mother of baby Gammy has gone to Bangkok to escape the intense media attention that has come with being the face of an international surrogacy row.

Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, is in the Thai capital getting advice on how to handle the reaction to news reports suggesting she solicited other women to be egg donors, according to Hands Across The Water - the charity taking care of the family's medical expenses.

Ms Pattaramon, who has been taking care of Gammy after he was abandoned by his Australian parents when they allegedly discovered he had Down syndrome, has been seeking advice from the Thai Rat newspaper on how to handle negative publicity.

'The reason she is in Bangkok right now is to deal with issues,' charity spokesman Nom Manochantr told Daily Mail Australia via a translator from Samitivej Sriracha Hospital, where Gammy is receiving treatment.

'Right now the story is going in a negative direction. She will have to be careful.'

Mr Manochantr was in Chon Buri, 80km south of Bangkok, to pay money for Ms Pattaramon's grandparents to stay in the private hospital, where they are minding Gammy while she is in Bangkok.

He said Ms Pattaramon's two eldest children were also in the hospital but declined to comment about whether her husband had accompanied her to Bangkok.

Hands Across The Water has been accepting donations on behalf of Gammy ever since the story of his alleged abandonment by Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell started receiving international media coverage.

The charity also facilitated his move from a local hospital to the private hospital where he is currently receiving treatment.

So far, $239,688 has been raised to help support the baby's development.

Hands Across The Water says every cent will go to Gammy.

Mr Manochantr said the charity and Ms Pattaramon had agreed she will not receive the money in a lump sum, and they will instead make a long-term plan for the money.

He added that when Gammy is released from hospital, which is likely to be early next week, he and Ms Pattaramon will go stay with a home stay family instead of returning to their home.

Mr Manochantr said Hands Across The Water was considering having them stay with one of their charity workers, or someone close to the charity.

He also said her grandparents would continue to live in their home in an industrial area in Chon Buri where they run a food stall serving Thai salads.

Mr Manochantr said the director of Samitivej Sriracha Hospital, Noppadol Noppakun, has offered to be to facilitate all of Gammy's medical treatment in the future. He added that the family had received medical treatment at a discounted rate.

'He is a good man,' Mr Manochantr said.

Mr Manochantr said Hands Across The Water director Peter Baines first contacted Ms Pattaramon when Gammy was admitted to the smaller, government-run hospital nearby in Sriracha.

They made the decision to move to the private hospital because it would provide better treatment, but also because the government-run hospital would not allow press access.

'She was planning to talk media and knew it would be too difficult in the other hospital,' Mr Manochantr said.

Mr Manochantr also said he did not believe the negative stories about Ms Pattaramon, and added they would have no impact on the charity's involvement.

'That is a separate issue, we are focussed on Gammy,' he said.

Hands Across The Water plans to support Gammy until he completes education, Mr Manochantr said.
