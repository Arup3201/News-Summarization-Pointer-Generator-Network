Belgium coach Marc Wilmots says that team captain Vincent Kompany has injured his groin again during training and will miss Thursday's match against South Korea at the World Cup.

In between leading the Belgian defense during victories over Algeria and Russia, the central defender already had to skip several days of training to treat a left groin strain.

He trained for some 25 minutes at the World Cup stadium late Wednesday but pulled out to avoid further damage, Wilmots said.

Since Belgium are already through to the second round, Wilmots had already considered giving Kompany rest to complete his recovery.

The second round is not until after the weekend and Kompany is hopeful to return in time to lead his side.

Wilmots also has to do without another defender, Thomas Vermaelen, who is being treated for a hamstring injury.
