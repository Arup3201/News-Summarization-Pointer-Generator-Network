An American probe launched eight years ago to explore Pluto has awoken from hibernation in deep space as it nears the dwarf planet and its moons.

New Horizons came out of hibernation this evening and has transmitted a message back to mission control on Earth showing that all of its systems are fully working. 

Alice Bowman, a physicist from Johns Hopkins University, said: 'New Horizons is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space, nearly three billion miles from home, but its rest is over.'

The craft is currently three billion miles from this planet meaning radio messages beamed back take nearly four and a half hours to arrive.

New Horizons was launched in January 2006 and drifted through space in hibernation for 1,873 days, about two thirds of its journey, while it travelled to the edge of our solar system.

During its trip, NASA engineers briefly woke the craft every few months to check if its systems were still functioning. The craft's computer has also been sending a weekly message to Earth, making 267 messages since it launched.

During its journey, New Horizons passed three to four times closer to Jupiter than the previous probe, using the planet's gravity to increase its speed and reduce journey times to Pluto by three years. 

While the probe has now awoken from its last hibernation phase, it will still take seven months to reach its closet point from Pluto, passing within 7,767miles of the planet's surface in July 2015.

As it flies past, it will beam images of Pluto and its largest moon Charon back to Earth, which will be the most detailed pictures ever taken of the bodies.

While there it will also examine several small, icy bodies in the Kupier Belt, the most densely populated part of our solar system which begins around 2.5billion miles from Earth.

As Pluto has an elliptical, or oval-shaped orbit, it strays into this region on its 247.7-year orbit around the sun. The object there are leftover debris from the birth of our solar system 4.6billion years ago.

Scientists have identified three possible objects that New Horizons could collect data from, which sit about 1.5billion miles further on from Pluto. 

New Horizons begins its exploration of Pluto in January at a distance of about 160million miles. 

This image of Jupiter and its moon Io was taken by New Horizons as it passed close to the planet in 2007, using its gravitational field to boost its speed and reduce the journey time to Pluto by three years

During its mission, New Horizons will collect data on Pluto and Charon's surfaces, giving astronomers an up-close look at the dim surfaces that are difficult to see from Earth.

The craft carries onboard seven instruments including infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers - which measure UV and infra-red waves, a multicolor camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera and a space dust detector.

All of the instruments aboard New Horizons draw power from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator - a type of nuclear motor - which provides less power than a pair of 100-watt light bulbs. 

Pluto is about 2,300 kilometers in diameter, smaller than Earth's moon, and has a mass about 500 times less than Earth. 

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union withdrew Pluto's status as a planet, reclassifying it as a dwarf planet and leaving the solar system with eight planets.

The news that New Horizons has successfully awoken is just the latest development in what has been an exciting few weeks for space travel.

On November 12 the European Space Agency made a momentous achievement in the history of space travel by successfully landing the first space probe, Rosetta, on a comet.

Though the probe's harpoons failed to launch, meaning it ultimately landed in a cave with its main solar panels blocked, it managed to use all of its instruments before running out of battery.

And two days ago NASA launched the first test flight of its Orion space-craft, hailed as the start of the Mars-era, it has the potential to carry astronauts to an asteroid and the red planet.

Observing Pluto before passing close to dwarf planet in July next year

It will then take the most detailed pictures of its surface ever seen

Will then observe objects in Kupier Belt - another 1.5billion miles away
