Tragic: Rising basketball star Joey Glynn collapsed and died during a game on Monday in Watertown, Massachusetts

A basketball player has died after collapsing while playing the game that he loved.

Joe Glynn, 19, was pronounced dead at a hospital after collapsing during a men's recreational summer league game at 7.30 pm on Monday, according to Lt. Michael Lawn of the Watertown Police Department.

Glynn played for Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts.

A teammate told the Boston Herald there was no physical contact with any other player before Glynn collapsed.

The 19-year-old was shooting hoops with former teammates from the Middlesex Magic AAU club when he fell down.

He was taken to Mount Auburn Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

An investigation into the cause of death was ongoing.

The devastated coach of Middlesex 
Magic, Mike Crotty, who was on the court with the young man on Monday, told ESPN: 'I 
loved the kid, he was a great person.

'He was a great brother to all of his
sisters, the kind of son you would want to have - didn’t do anything 
wrong, did what he was asked.

'If I had a daughter someday, my hope is that she would meet a guy like Joey Glynn.'

The 6ft 5in forward from Abington 
averaged 3.3 points and 3.2 rebounds per game as a freshman last season 
for the NCAA Division II Falcons, who finished 11-15.

Glynn was an All-Scholastic while playing at Cardinal Spellman High School in Brockton.

Lt. Lawn says the death remains under investigation but it does not appear suspicious.

The 19-year-old is the fourth child of Joseph and Susan Glynn and is survived by his four sisters Kelly, Sarah, Stephanie and Ashley.

Bentley University President, Gloria Cordes Larson, released a statement on behalf of the school on Tuesday.

It read: 'Today, with great sadness, we 
informed the Bentley community that Joseph (Joey) Glynn, who just 
completed his freshman year and was a member of our basketball team, 
collapsed Monday evening while playing basketball during an Amateur 
Athletic Union men’s game (a recreational league) in Watertown, Mass. He
died later in the evening at Mount Auburn Hospital.

'Our deepest sympathies go out to Joey’s family, friends, classmates, teammates and professors as they struggle to comprehend the sudden loss of such a vibrant young life. Joey was 19 years old and from Abington, Mass.  

'He graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School in 2012 where he was a two-time Boston Globe and Boston Herald All-Scholastic. Joey was a two-year captain in basketball, captain of the football team during his senior year, and lettered in baseball.  As a junior he had the distinction of playing at Gillette Stadium and TD Garden for the high school Super Bowl.  In his senior year he led Spellman to the Super Bowl for a second time.

'Members of our staff are in contact with Joey’s family and are providing support for his teammates. Joey is survived by his parents, Joseph and Susan Glynn, and his four sisters, Kelly, Sarah, Stephanie and Ashley. Joey’s father, Joseph Glynn, is a 1987 MBA alumnus of the Bentley Graduate School of Business.

'Bentley’s Student Counseling Center, the Spiritual Life Center, the Center for Health and Wellness, and Office of Student Affairs are open as places of support and comfort.  Information about a campus memorial will be shared as soon as it is available.'
