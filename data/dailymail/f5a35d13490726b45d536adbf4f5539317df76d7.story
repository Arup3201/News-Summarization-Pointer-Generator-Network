Lewis Hamilton stole the show with his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger as the celebrity couple sampled the Monaco nightlife on Thursday night.

Hamilton, who leads the Formula One World Championship after winning the last four races, sported a Ferrari red dinner jacket and black bow-tie.

The 29-year-old Briton was pictured with Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst and Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley at the AIDS charitable fundraiser in Monte Carlo.

Hamilton had earlier turned his battle with team-mate, and rival for the title, Nico Rosberg, whom he leads by three points, into class warfare.

Hamilton, the richest sportsman in Britain with an estimated wealth of £68million, said: 'I come from a not great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad's apartment.

'And Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats. So the hunger is different. I've got to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit to win the World Championship.'

Hamilton, Rosberg and the rest of the 
paddock will enjoy a rest day today - as is tradition in Monaco - ahead 
of qualifying tomorrow.

Hamilton is eager to claim what would remarkably be his first pole position in eight attempts here, even though he is fourth on the all-time standings with 35 to his name.

And Hamilton has made no secret of the fact as to how he would like matters to unfold on Sunday in a bid to put daylight between himself and Rosberg.

Asked by the official website, formula1.com, as to what would be his dream result, Hamilton replied: 'Finishing first, Fernando (Alonso) finishing second and Sebastian (Vettel) finishing third. 'That would be it for me.

'The dream result for the team would be the Mercedes cars finishing one-two, and one of those guys in third.'
