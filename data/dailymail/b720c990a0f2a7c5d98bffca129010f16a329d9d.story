Everton manager Roberto Martinez has highlighted Liverpool's striker Divock Origi as the biggest threat facing his side in Lille on Thursday night in a match the Spaniard describes as 'a little final' along the road to Europa League knockout qualification.

Origi, 19, signed for Liverpool from Lille in a £10million deal last summer following a speactacular World Cup but was immediately loaned back to his French club, where he has scored four goals this season.

Martinez said of the pacy striker: 'He is a well-known player in England already, because of his play at the World Cup and because he signed for our big rivals Liverpool.

'We know in years to come he will have a big say in the Premier League.'

Everton top their group with four points from two matches while Lille have drawn both their opening games.

With only two to qualify from a four-team group that also features Krasnodar and Wolfsburg, Martinez regards their game in northern France as key.

Martinez says Thursday's game is the most important of the group campaign for both clubs

'Lille might see this as the most important game of their campaign and it is the same for us. It could be a little-final. I must admit I admired the way they played last season.

'Maybe now they are waiting to click this season and that is our worry. We need to concentrate, we don't want them to click on Thursday.'

Everton have taken a strong squad to Lille including  20-year-old  Ross Barkley, who made his first appearance of the season against Aston Villa on Saturday after recovering from a knee ligament injury.

Barkley is expected to make his European debut cheered on by nearly 7,000 travelling Everton fans.

Leon Osman and Steven Naismith have been kept on Merseyside to rest after an intense run of matches while Bryan Oviedo, Kevin Mirallas and Arouna Kone miss out through injury.

But 36-year-old Sylvain Distin has travelled after missing the last four games.

'It is an exciting game from our point of view. We have been looking forward to this fixture,' said Martinez.

'We have a phenomenal support and could have sold a lot more seats. We know our fans are going to travel in big big numbers and we want to make them proud.'

Around 7,000 Everton fans are expected to be in Lille for the game, with a number travelling without tickets
