A mother-of-one who was terrified of getting stuck in an aeroplane seat has been crowned this year’s Slimming World Slimmer of the Year after losing 16 stone.

Sue Thompson, 40, was so afraid of getting her 27-stone frame stuck in an aeroplane seat that she spent years avoiding her family’s requests for a foreign holiday.

However, Mrs Thompson, who dropped ten dress sizes to weigh a healthy 11 stone, can now jet off on her first holiday with husband, Shaun, and daughter, Jessica-Ray, 15.

Sue Thompson, 40, shrank from an obese 27 stone to a healthy 11 stone. She also dropped ten dress sizes to go from a size 32 to a size 12. She has been crowned Slimming World's Slimmer of the Year

She was so heavy (left) that she once cracked a sunbed but she says that when she was younger she was not worried about her weight and that embarrassing events like this did not motivate her to lose weight (right)

Mrs Thompson, who left her job to work for Slimming World as a regional advisor, said that she had lived with being large her whole life but had never felt any worse for it, despite her weight often leading to some embarrassing situations.

She said: ‘I knew I wasn’t one of the skinny girls at school but it never affected me when it came to friends or boyfriends and I wasn’t bullied or anything like that.

‘As I got older I started to gain more weight but even embarrassing situations, like the time I cracked a sunbed at a tanning salon, didn’t motivate me to lose weight. 

‘It changed when I had Jess, I hated the idea that I might be an embarrassment to her or Shaun.

‘They never said anything and I know they loved me whatever my size but I always worried about how my weight impacted on them.’

Mrs Thompson, from Durham, spent years making excuses not to attend social occasions because she was afraid of embarrassing her husband, and avoided parents' evenings in case other mothers thought she was a bad parent.

Mrs Thompson says she was motivated to lose weight by the birth of her daughter, Jessica Ray, 15. She was so embarrassed by her weight that she avoided parents' evenings for fear people would think her a bad mother

Mrs Thompson says that she does not consider herself to be on a diet now - she just ditched the takeaways and only eats fresh, home-cooked food

A turning point came when she realised her size also had implications for her long-term health and dying prematurely became a real concern.

She said: ‘I’d sort of accepted that being overweight was my fate. I genuinely believed that my weight would be what killed me – which is scary looking back now because I was only 37.

‘I used to go to bed at night and wonder if that might be the night I didn’t wake up.’

As a result, Mrs Thompson joined a slimming club in March 2010 in a bid to lose weight and save her life.

She said: ‘I was totally embarrassed.
I was terrified I’d be too big for the scales and even made my friend 
check with the consultant first, and I worried I’d be the biggest person
there.

‘I probably was
the biggest but it didn’t matter, everyone was different shapes and 
sizes but we were all in the same boat and in it together.’

Mrs Thompson used to be too afraid of getting stuck in an aeroplane seat to go on foreign holidays. She is now looking forward to taking her daughter, Jessica-Ray (left), on the family's first trip abroad

Mrs Thompson was worried that her weight would eventually kill her. She feared that one night she would go to sleep and not wake up so she felt that she needed to join a slimming club to save her own life

Mrs Thompson ditched the takeaways and ate only fresh food cooked at home.

She said: ‘I always say I’m not on a diet, I just eat healthily now.

‘I’ve got a completely different relationship with food. It used to be a battle, but now I know how to eat healthily and that I can still have treats if I want them so there’s nothing to fight anymore.

‘If I want a treat I have it, but 
I’ve found that a lot of the time you only want it because you think you
can’t or shouldn’t have it.’

Mrs Thompson lost 10st in 12 months and was 15st lighter by the time her 40th birthday came around in October 2012.

Her weight fell from 27st 8lb to 11st 5½lb and her dress size shrank from 32 to a 12.

Mrs Thompson says that when she attended her first Slimming World Class she was terrified she would be the heaviest person there and that she would break the scales

She said that losing the weight has completely changed her life.

‘People often don’t recognise me and say that I look like a new person, I feel like one too. At T in the Park someone even described me as a cougar, I couldn’t believe they meant me!

‘Three years ago I never dreamed that I’d be able to lose the weight, so it’s hard to believe I’m not only half the size I was but that I have a whole new career and so much to look forward to.

‘Life really has begun at 40 for me and I can’t wait to get stuck in! When I went to bed I used to worry whether I’d wake up or not, now I find it hard to sleep because I’m thinking about all of the exciting things I’ve got planned.

‘And winning Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2013 is just the icing on the cake!’
