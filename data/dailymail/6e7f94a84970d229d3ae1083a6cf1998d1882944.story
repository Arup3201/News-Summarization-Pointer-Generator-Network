Dozens of discarded shopping trolleys are stacked into an enormous heap after being dragged from the River Thames as part of a major clean-up operation.

The trolleys were among a staggering four tons of junk that was pulled from a 200ft stretch of the Thames by a 50-strong team of volunteer students.

Other bizarre items cleared from the river bed at Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey included 35 skateboards, 14 bikes, three prams, almost 400 bottles and four carpets.

Shopping? A traffic cone, several bicycles as well as several trolleys are among the detritus pulled from the Thames after volunteers decided to clean up the river bed

The items were found by a team of 15 divers then pulled from the river using grapple hooks by volunteers on the riverside.

They were then stacked onto a barge and towed away by the Environment Agency to be recycled.

The project was run by Kingston University Sub Aqua Club and nearby dive centre Aquanaut Scuba and Snorkelling.

Messy business: Four tons of junk was dredged from just a 200ft section of the Thames at Richmond by volunteers. The items were found by a team of 15 divers then pulled from the river using grapple hooks by volunteers on the riverside

The clean-up was first held in 2011 after being started by former Kingston University student and keen diver Chris Elliot.

Last year’s event saw three tons of junk retrieved from the same stretch of river.

Lynne Clafton, one of the coordinators of the clean-up, said: “This is the third year the river clean has taken place and it was the biggest and most successful yet.

Gloves: A volunteer and the rubbish pulled from the River Thames.

Piles of waste: The rubbish pulled from the Thames is stored on a barge ready to be taken off for recycling after more than 50 volunteers got stuck into help

'We had more than 50 volunteers helping to remove debris from a 200ft stretch of the Thames close to by Kingston Bridge.

'The divers found the big items like trolleys and prams, connected a grapple hook onto them and then people on the banks of the river dragged the items out.

'Everything was logged then stacked onto a barge which the Environment Agency took away at the end of the day to be recycled.

'The amount of stuff we retrieved from the river was shocking – it was a real eye opener.

'People walking by were staggered at the sheer volume of junk we were pulling out.

'As divers we spend so much time in the water and we wanted to give something back to the community.

'It has been proven that clean-up projects along the Thames have helped improve the environment for wildlife and we hope our project will contribute to that.'
