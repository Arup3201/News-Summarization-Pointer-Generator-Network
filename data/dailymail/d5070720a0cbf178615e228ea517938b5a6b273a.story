Real Housewives of Atlanta's Kim Zolciak has opened up her wedding album after marrying toyboy Kroy Biermann in a lavish ceremony last week. 

The 33-year-old wore not one but THREE dramatic - and rather expensive - ensembles throughout her nuptials.

And she was happy to show them off in pictures for this week's issue of Life & Style magazine.

One is not enough: Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak wore not one but three wedding outfits for her $1 million nuptials to Kroy Biermann, here she is seen in her first wedding gown worth $58,000

Fellow reality TV star Kim Kardashian also had three costume changes during her ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries back in August, but the new mother is no doubt hoping for a more happier ending to her fairytale.

The most extravagant ensemble of the three was Kim's low cut 32 pound and $58,000 opulent creation.

The Southern belle-style gown was the centrepiece for when Kim and Kroy exchanged nuptials.

Kim bought the hand-made Baracci Beverly Hills creation from website PreOwnedWeddingDresses.com after falling in love with the used frock online.

Second frock: At her reception the reality star 
switched dresses, putting another pearl and Swarovski crystals creation,
 this time a $18,000 mermaid style gown designed by Pnina Tornai of Say 
Yes to the Dress fame

The over-the-top number was covered in Swarovski crystals, pearls, beads and embroidered lace, while the fabric was 100 percent Duchess Satin.

She also wore a matching veil which had the same, hand-stitched detailing and a glittering tiara.

'I just remember thinking, this is the day I’ve waited my whole life for,' Kim tells Life & Style. 'I really do feel like I’m dreaming.'

Third time lucky: Kim kept with the frou-frou theme for her third ensemble, opting for a $16,000 backless jumpsuit by the same designer

And Kim kept with the frou-frou theme for her third ensemble, opting for a $16,000 backless jumpsuit by the same designer.

The design, which showed off quite a bit of Kim's flesh, was also adorned with pearl and Swarovski crystal flowers.

While her wedding outfits added up to a hefty $92,000, Kim also spared no expense when it came to her two daughters Brielle, 14, and 
Ariana, nine, from her first marriage.

The girls were dressed in custom-made Anais Collezioni frocks.

The reality star also splashed out a considerable amount of cash on bling.

The bride rocked a gigantic 11-carat emerald-cut knuckle duster band for herself, while Kroy slipped on a serious sparkler featuring 77 black diamonds and 26 white diamonds.

Other extravagant items included $14,000 11-layer cake from Highland Bakery, and napkins embroidered with the couple’s monogram.

Kim said she had no problems shelling out for the whopping $1 million bill.

'We spared no expense, you only do this once,' she told Life & Style magazine.

'This is it for me. It was very expensive, but we were in a position to do it, and I’m thankful for that.'

But she reiterated that the best part of it all was getting married to the love of her life.

'I can’t believe I’m married. I’m so excited. When you find the right person, you’re 1,000 percent sure,' she told Life & Style.

'Now we’re a family, and it’s such a blessing.'

Walking on a cloud: Kim tweeted her joy during her wedding day which took place in Atlanta on November 11 last week

Meanwhile Kroy, an American football player for the Atlanta Falcons, sported a white suit jacket and black bow tie for the nuptials and later slipped on a more casual black shirt for the reception.

The couple's baby son Kroy 
Jagger, who was born in June, was also there.

Kim clearly loved every aspect of her special day which took place on 'lucky date' November 11, 2011.

'Beautiful weather! Beautiful day!! I'm walking on a cloud and I'm so grateful,' she wrote on her Twitter account.

Used dress: The reality show star found her over-the-top gown on website www.preownedweddingdresses.com

It has also been revealed that Kim's lavish wedding will be aired in her new reality spin-off series titled, Don't Be Tardy for the Wedding.

A representative for Bravo confirmed to Life & Style that Kim's show will air in 2012.

'I am so excited to share my life with everyone,' Kim told Life & Style. 'I can't wait for everybody to see my personal life on an intimate level.'

Kim met her much-younger husband at an Atlanta fundraiser in 2010 and thinks he fits in perfectly with her family.

Reality show stars: Kim's meeting with Kroy was featured on the hit Real Housewives of Atlanta

'He's really fantastic with my 
girls,' she told People magazine during her pregnancy. 'I couldn't have 
asked for a better partner ever.'

Kim,
 33, and Kroy, 26, got engaged in early October this year.
