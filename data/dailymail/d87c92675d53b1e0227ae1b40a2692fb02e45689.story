A man is facing up to 15 years in jail after breaking into an apartment while wielding a machete.

Twain Thomas, 54, from Potacello, Idaho, was threatening residents with the weapon in his building in February 2013, when he kicked down the door of James Cvengros and his girlfriend Kaila Gearhart's home.

Mr Cvengros manage to capture the moment on a digital camera after he heard the commotion and decided to press record.

He then shot Thomas after the pair had screamed at him, demanding that he leave.  

Waiting: James Cvengros is seen standing at the door of his apartment in Potacello, Idaho, after hearing a commotion outside. The noise prompted him to film what was going on. He is seen holding a handgun

Smash: Twain Thomas then kicks the door down, forcing Mr Cvengros and his girlfriend Kaila Gearhart' to flee 

Jailed: Twain was given a five-year fixed term and a 10-year indeterminate sentence for a string of aggravated assault charges and attempted murder

Mr Cvengros told Local 8 News: 'If he hadn't been shot at that time, then we would be looking at a murder case, not an attempted murder case.' 

The footage was captured during Twain's sentencing on Thursday. He was given a five-year fixed term and a 10-year indeterminate sentence for a string of aggravated assault charges and attempted murder.

His neuro-psychologist Mark Corgiat found Twain has suffered from both PTSD and frontal-lobe damage to his brain due to a past car accident.

His defense attorney Dave Martinez said Thomas wasn't aware of what he was doing at the time.

The lawyer claimed he finally snapped out of it once he was shot.

In a solemn apology, Thomas told the court: 'I have never had anything like this happen before in my life.' 

During the the trial, prosecutors said that Twain's military past meant he was a danger to the public. 

Along with the possibility of serving a total of 15 years behind bars, Thomas will also need to pay a $1,200 fine and the no-contact order will stay in place until 2025. 

Dangerous: The 54-year-old then walks into the apartment brandishing a machete and threatens the pair. Moments later he was shot
