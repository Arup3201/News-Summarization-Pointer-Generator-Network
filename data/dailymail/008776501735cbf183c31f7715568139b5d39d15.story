Toes in Salzburg are tapping to a new beat as the city finally plays host to a show of the Hollywood blockbuster that put it on the map nearly 50 years ago.

The Sound of Music has made its debut at the Salzburg State Theatre, more used to hosting opera and operettas.

The musical has already had a surprisingly positive reaction in Salzburg, commonly seen as a last bulwark of resistance to the iconic show.

No problem for Maria: Wietske van Tongeren, pictured in dress rehearsal for the show, has become the first actress to play Maria on stage in Salzburg itself

The musical, based on a true story, was immortalised in the award-winning 1965 film starring Julie Andrews as the governess of seven children who charms - then weds - their widowed father Baron von Trapp, before the family flee the Nazis.

The city's culture is a far cry from Hollywood meaning that most locals are likely to prefer the sounds of native composers Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms than they are to be familiar with the musical's song lyrics.

While residents earn millions each year from the tourists who come for sing-a-long tours of sites featured in the film, they are known for viewing the visitors with disdain.

Campaigners of the neighbourhood where the von Trapp home is located tried - and failed - to block attempts to turn it into a hotel, fearing fans would cause havoc.

A home is still being sought for a museum dedicated to the film after more than 600 residents in another neighborhood objected three years ago.

They told the city council they feared that surrounding streets would be jammed with tour buses.

Peter Proetzner, who guides daily coaches of tourists on pilgrimages to the sites made famous in the film, cited a poll showing the Sound of Music as the city's second biggest draw - right after the dozens of classical music events held in the city every night.

'The Sound of Music is better known than Mozart worldwide,' he insisted.

Tourist Dianne Cole, from Australia, admits she knows 'absolutely nothing' about Austria and will probably return home still ignorant of the country's cultural and scenic delights.

'But this is why I came to Austria,' she told the Boston Globe, 'The sole reason is to do this tour'.

Austria has worked hard to shed perceived associations with the Nazis.

Millions of euros have reportedly been donated to Holocaust victims and their descendants, and schoolbooks now deal in depth with the nation's complicity in the crimes of Adolf Hitler, born just 30 miles north of Salzburg.

Andreas Gergen, who directed the German-language production said: 'I think that this is truly the right moment in time, when Austrians are actually ready to deal with their past.'
