The gold Rolex given to President Dwight Eisenhower for his heroic role in D-Day is being auctioned for the first time in its history - for an estimated $1million.

Experts say the wristwatch is among the most important made by the Swiss firm, which is now one of the watchmaking world's most prestigious names.

The 18-carat timepiece, the firm's 150,000th, was presented to the five-star general in 1951 for his service in the Second World War after the 100,000th was given to Winston Churchill.

Million dollar watch: The gold Rolex given by the firm to Dwight Eisenhower for his heroics on D-Day is being sold for the first time in its history. He wore it throughout his eight-year presidency and in official portraits

Inscription: The watch was engraved with his initials, the five stars of a general and the date Eisenhower was named NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe on December 19, 1950. It is expected to fetch $1m

Prominent: The 18-carat timepiece appeared clearly on Eisenhower's wrist on a 1952 cover of Life magazine

He wore it regularly throughout his two-term presidency and in official portraits including on the cover of Life magazine in 1952.

But when he died in 1969, instead of leaving the watch to his son John, he bequeathed it to a faithful Army colleague who had followed him all the way to the White House.

Sgt John Moaney had served alongside the future president in Europe and became one of his closest allies, following him in his later years to his farm in in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

Sgt Moaney had the watch for almost 10 years as he worked on the farm for Eisenhower's widow Mamie, until it came into the hands of one of the world's most famous White House collectors.

Raleigh DeGeer Amyx rose through the ranks of the FBI, befriending dozens of Presidential staff along the way, and amassed a vast collection of memorabilia.

Auctioneer Bobby Livingston told MailOnline: 'Experts think it is the most important Rolex watch ever made'

Memorabilia: The watch is part of a vast collection amassed by the late FBI employee Raleigh DeGeer Amyx. Also being sold in the auction this September is Eisenhower's brown leather 1940s flying jacket (pictured)

Honour: Eisenhower (left) was given the firm's 150,000th watch after the 100,000th was presented to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (pictured with him right). It commemorated his heroics on D-Day in 1944

Gift: The President (right) left the watch in his will to former Army colleague Sgt John Moaney, who followed him all the way to the White House and remained with him on his rural farm until his death in 1969

He bought the watch from Sgt Moaney's widow Delores three decades ago, and it became one of his proudest assets.

Now 76, Amyx's Florida home is too small to contain his collection and much of it will now be auctioned off - with the gold wristwatch being the most legendary lot.

Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, told MailOnline: 'We estimate it to sell for one million dollars.

'Experts think it is the most important Rolex watch ever made.

'Rolex in the 1950s was not the brand it is today and from what I understand, the fact that it's hitting the market has made the Rolex community very excited.

'Amex's children aren't interested in the items and he thought it was time to sell them. Many of them are museum pieces which are deserving of proper conservation.'

Collector: Raleigh DeGeer Amyx, now 76, wearing the million-dollar watch. Several of his pieces are being sold

Certified: One of the messages written for Amyx by Moaney's widow, who was Eisenhower's personal cook

The auction on September 17 in Boston, Massachusetts, will include several items owned by the president famous for leading the Americans in the D-Day landings.

Veterans have marked a solemn 70th anniversary of the bloody assault on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, which was hailed as the turning point in the Allied fight.

As Supreme Allied Commander in 
Europe, Eisenhower planned and ordered the landings which were known to 
his U.S. troops as Operation Overlord.

The first day of the invasion left more than 4,400 Allied soldiers dead, according to research by the U.S. National D-Day Memorial Foundation, much higher than the traditionally-quoted figure of 2,500.

But despite the heavy casualties, the operation was seen ultimately as a success, allowing the Allies to deliver the first of a series of fatal blows to Nazi troops on continental soil.

The iconic Rolex was an Oyster Perpetual Datejust
 chronometer on a Jubilee bracelet, and was presented to Eisenhower for his wartime achievements two years before he was elected president.

Commemoration: Memorials are being held to mark 70 years since the D-Day landings, which killed thousands

Deaths: U.S. troops on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944. Despite devastating losses, the vast mission allowed the Allies to gain a crucial foothold in occupied Europe during the Second World War

He requested the engraving on the case
 back and clasp, which were inscribed with his initials DDE along with 
the five-star general symbol.

It also bears the date that Eisenhower became the first Supreme Allied Commander under NATO, 12-19-1950.

Rolex had made it a tradition to give every 50,000th watch to a prominent figure in the Armed Forces.

Swiss General 
Henri Guisan was handed the 50,000th chronometer, while Britain's
Winston Churchill was given the 100,000th.

After
 Eisenhower received the 150,000th they asked him for suggestions
 as to who should receive the 200,000th. Both parties agreed General 
Matthew Ridgway, who revived the UN's Korean War effort, should receive 
it.

Other possessions of 
the former President to be sold include his Second World War brown 
leather flight jacket, which features four-star epaulettes on the 
shoulders.

A pair of 
binoculars given to the President in 1953 will go under the hammer, 
along with a painting he made after the war ended of Telegraph Cottage, the small British 
home in Kingston, Surrey, where he planned his most audacious 
raids.

The painting is expected to fetch between $100,000 and $200,000 while the jacket is estimated at $40,000 to $60,000.

To be sold: Eisenhower's brown leather flying jacket was worn by him in the early 1940s as he led U.S. troops

Historic: Also going under the hammer will be this painting which Eisenhower made after the war of Telegraph Cottage, the small British retreat in Kingston, Surrey, where he planned his most audacious raids on Europe

Memorabilia: This set of binoculars was presented to the President in 1953 and engraved with his name

Close-up: The binoculars feature the President's name and his title, and were used during his two terms

Other presidents also feature in the auction.

Going under them hammer will be the top hat which President Roosevelt wore during his first presidential inauguration on March 4, 1933.

A distinctive blue-back wool, satin and velvet cape worn by FDR - along with his walnut cane - will also go under the hammer.

The comparatively simple Rolex is almost as expensive as the most expensive commercially available watch in the world, the $1.1million Super Ice Cube by Swiss firm Chopard - which includes more than 2,000 cut diamonds.

However, it does not come close to the most expensive watch ever auctioned.

That title has been held for more than a decade by the Henry Graves Supercomplication, created for the New York banker of the same name in 1933.

Legend has it the banker had a competition with a friend over who could possess the most complicated watch.

Other lots: Amyx also owned an unusual black cape worn by President Franklin D Roosevelt

Walking stick: FDR's cane featured in the collection by Amyx, 76, who built it up over several decades

So he commissioned the one-of-a-kind gold timepiece by Patek Philippe, which remained the most complicated watch in the world for more than 50 years.

It sold to an anonymous bidder for $11million in 1999, and its whereabouts remained a mystery until it surfaced suddenly in 2012.

A member of the Qatari royal family reportedly pledged the watch and other valuables totalling $83million to Sotheby's auction house, to cover outstanding debts.
