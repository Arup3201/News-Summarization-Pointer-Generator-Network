Sick craze: Ben (not pictured) admits to taunting relatives and friends of a girl who had committed suicide by posting vile messages on her Facebook memorial page

What started as a simple wind-up on a discussion forum has evolved into something altogether more distressing for the unsuspecting victims he targets.

Ben, an unemployed 19-year-old, is what some are now calling an 'RIP troller' - a web user who gets their kicks from taunting grieving relatives online.

He admits to once posting the message 'How's it hanging, guys?' on the Facebook memorial page of a young girl who had taken her own life.

But he doesn't care.

'I've pretty much lost all hope for humanity anyway,' he said. 'I don't believe that anything can save people.'

Ben, who has asked to use a pseudonym, first embarked on the craze in 2008 when he took to the online forum 4Chan to provoke people discussing religion by claiming to have disproved all that they had argued.

'It just makes me happy when I can make someone angry,' he told news.com.au.

'It sounds weird, but I kind of feed off their anger. The angrier I can get them, the better I feel.'

He is certainly not alone as there's thought to be a whole community of like-minded people out there.

They don't always target the pain of loss, however.

Another troller who's come forward is Sarah, a 23-year-old mother from South Australia, who confessed to setting up a Facebook page aimed at taunting another mum who had posted near-naked pictures of herself on a breastfeeding forum.

'She started getting negative replies and deleted the pictures, but I saved the pictures and uploaded them to a Facebook group where she was humiliated,' Sarah said.

Sarah later deleted the photos after being threatened with expulsion from the site.

'I randomly targeted a lady for no reason, humiliated her for no reason - just to be a b****,' she said. 'Looking back now it was petty. I'm one of those remorseful trolls, I suppose.'

In one of the sickest cases of RIP trolling, 25-year-old unemployed loner Sean Duffy was jailed for 18 weeks after targeting the Facebook tribute page of a dead teenage girl.

Lauren Drew, 14, had been found by her mother dead in her bed after suffering a suspected fit during the night.

But if her mother, Carole, thought her pain could not get any more profound, she was cruelly mistaken.

At first, she derived some comfort from the thousands of people who posted their condolences on RIP pages set up in memory of Lauren on Facebook.

Then a few weeks later, she saw a posting that was to mark the beginning of a new nightmare.

It was an image of a horse and cart pulling her daughter’s coffin, with the words ‘Happy Mother’s Day’.

Day after day, for nearly a month, the awful messages kept on coming. Each one was more carefully crafted than the last, twisting the knife deeper into Carole’s heart.

One picture of Lauren carried the plea: ‘Help me, Mummy. It’s hot in hell.’

Duffy was eventually tracked down by police and prosecuted.

Cyber-researcher Karyn Krawford told news.com.au that the sick craze may be a sign of mental illness.

'This lack of empathy caused people to become emotionally immune and desensitised to images they're not seeing in real life,' she said.

And psychologist James Heathers, of the University of Sydney, believes it is also down to the feeling of being anonymous, known as 'deindividuation'

'Social distance can cause a 55-year-old climate change sceptic with a job and a mortgage to behave like a spastic donkey with strange malicious behaviour,' he said.

Earlier this month, a major study by the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research at the University of Bedfordshire concluded that police needed more powers to investigate internet harassment as more abusers move online to target their victims.

Current legislation means the longest sentence a perpetrator of harassment or stalking online can face is just six months, which researchers say is not enough of a deterrent.
