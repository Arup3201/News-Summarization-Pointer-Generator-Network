The spokeswoman for Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign is trying to laugh off her vitriolic rant against a former intern, whom she branded a 'fame-hungry b****' and a 'sl**bag.'

Barbara Morgan has apologized for the comments she made about Olivia Nuzzi to the blog Talking Points Memo, and said she thought her comments were off the record.

But she tried to shrug off the shocking slurs by tweeted a picture of a 'swear jar' full of cash and a credit card.

'Not my best day yesterday. Should've known better, been better. Gotta pay up,' she wrote.

'In a moment of frustration, I used 
inappropriate language in what I thought was an off-the-record 
conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said 
tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize,' she said in a 
statement.

Embattled
 New York mayoral candidate Weiner is standing by his embattled 
communication director. When asked if she was still employed with the 
campaign, he said 'Yep.'

Nuzzi, for her part, accepted the apology.

'As to Barbara Morgan's apology, of course I accept it,' she wrote on Twitter.

However
 her account on the social media site includes a not-so-subtle reference
 to the scandal. In he description of herself, she writes that she is a 
'sl**bag, t*** and c***' - all hateful terms that Morgan called her.

Morgan's over the top outburst was prompted by Nuzzi penning an article, published in Tuesday’s New York Daily News, in which she was highly critical of how Weiner's campaign was run.

She claimed many interns had only joined to get closer to Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, in the hope of landing a role in any potential presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

She claimed that one campaign staffer 
had left because he had only been paid one-third of what he was promised
 and that Weiner incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 
'Monica.'

In the controversial article Nuzzi 
said 'a lot' of Weiner's staff had 'short résumés,' including Morgan, 
who Nuzzi had mocked because she 'last worked as the press secretary for
 the New Jersey state education commissioner.'

Ouch: Oliva Nuzzi wrote a scathing article about her time as an intern for the Anthony Weiner campaign

Olivia Nuzzi accepted Morgan's apology, but had some cutting commentary on the controversy by using the words sh was called in her Twitter profile

'I'm
 dealing with like stupid f**king interns who make it on to the cover of
 the Daily News even though they signed NDAs and/or they proceeded to 
trash me,' Morgan told TPM, referring to a non-disclosure agreement that
 Nuzzi would have signed.

'And by the way, I tried to fire her, but she begged to come back and I gave her a second chance.'

Morgan went on to suggest in her conversation to TPM that 
Nuzzi would be unable to ever get another job in New York politics as
 a result of her actions.

'F******
 s***bag. Nice f**king glamour shot on the cover of the Daily News. Man,
 see if you ever get a job in this town again,' said Morgan.

She also described Nuzzi's allegation as 'b*******.'

Need a break? New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner's campaign is in meltdown after a former intern revealed what it was like to work for him and his comms director lost her cool in a very public manner

Nuzzi is believed to have stopped interning for the campaign four weeks ago 
and worked on the campaign for about a month.

Morgan said Nuzzi’s initially showed some enthusiasm for working for Weiner, but claimed that her ability left much to be desired.

‘She sucked. She like wasn’t good at setting up events. She was clearly there because she wanted to be seen. Like it was, like, terrible and I had to like - she would like, she would just not show up for work,’ said Morgan.

‘For the four weeks she worked there - she didn’t work weekends, so twenty days total. Of those twenty days, she missed probably five because she would just like not show up and not tell me she wasn’t going to be there. So, yeah, so there’s that.’
