The Capital One Cup is often heralded as the talent factory when it comes to English football.

Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Cesc Fabregas all made their debuts in the competition, as many youngsters are given an opportunity to strut their stuff with the first team.

So, as another round approaches, which young guns should you be watching out for at your club?

Chuba Akpom (Arsenal, vs Southampton)

Age: 18

Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19)

A name which is probably familiar to most Arsenal fans, though Akpom has yet to be given a true chance to shine in the first team.

A tall, quick and powerful striker, the 18-year-old has a fine scoring record with the youth ranks in North London and impressed on the right wing in the competition against West Brom last season. 

His mix of raw power and a much improved eye for goal has delighted Arsene Wenger, who says he is a 'huge talent'.

Jordan Rossiter (Liverpool, vs Middlesbrough)

Age: 17

Nationality: England (Under 18)

Labelled as a 'potential young Steven Gerrard' by Robbie Fowler, the pressure has been on young Rossiter since he was 15.

The cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well, though, furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for Brendan Rodgers. Jordan Henderson is out, so the time might be now for Rossiter to partner Gerrard in the centre.

Jordi Hiwula (Manchester City, vs Sheffield Wednesday)

Age: 18

Nationality: England (Under 19)

Despite being a lifelong United supporter Hiwula has really kicked on at Manchester City. Along with Devante Cole (son of Andy), has scored bags of goal for the Elite Development Squad under Patrick Vieira.

Will possibly be competing with Jose Angel Pozo for a place in the squad with Edin Dzeko the only fit senior striker at the club, and could get the nod due to his speed and clinical edge up front.

Lewis Baker (Chelsea, vs Bolton)

Age: 19

Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19)

A mainstay last season as Chelsea won the FA Youth Cup, Baker shone with his dynamism in midfield and his box-to-box running.

Made his senior debut against Derby earlier this year, and will hope for another opportunity against Sheffield Wednesday.

Isaac Hayden (Arsenal, vs Southampton)

Age: 19

Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19) 

Another Gunner who featured in the match against West Brom, Hayden is a versatile who is another imposing figure in the youth team.

Hayden is the captain of the Under 21 team, primarily at centre back, but his only experience under Wenger has come at the heart of midfield. Given the defensive casualties at Arsenal at the moment though, he is expected start in his favoured position against Southampton.

The French boss admitted Hayden is 'now ready for that level'. Glowing praise, indeed.

Semi Ajayi (Arsenal, vs Southampton)

Age: 21

Nationality: Nigerian 

More of an unearthed diamond, Ajayi has followed a similar route as Carl Jenkinson in progressing to a possible debut.

Signed from Charlton after a successful trial last year, the 21-year-old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on Calum Chambers' selection.

Sheyi Ojo (Liverpool, vs Middlesbrough)

Age: 17

Nationality: England (Under 18)

Shot to fame with two goals against West Ham in the Under 21 Premier League earlier this month, and could be an option for Rodgers on the wing against Middlesbrough.

Blessed with blistering pace and Raheem Sterling-like dribbling, Liverpool beat the likes of Chelsea to sign the 14-year-old for £2million from MK Dons in 2011.

Sheyi Ojo has impressed this season for Liverpool's youth teams and is set for stardom

Matt Targett (Southampton, vs Arsenal)

Age: 19

Nationality: England (Under 20)

If you thought Southampton's line of production was over after their summer departures, think again.

Following on from Luke Shaw, Targett is a left-back who has been involved in the first team set-up this season, albeit on the bench.

Tipped to shine this season by Ronald Koeman, the 19-year-old could step in for Ryan Bertrand on Tuesday night.

Tyias Browning (Everton, vs Swansea)

Age: 20

Nationality: England (Under 21) 

The highly-rated versatile defender penned a new three-year contract at Everton in the summer, and could make his bow against Swansea.

Able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence, Browning impressed in the Championship on loan at Wigan last season.

Sullay KaiKai (Crystal Palace, vs Newcastle)

Age: 19

Nationality: England 

An immensely talented individual following on from Victor Moses and Wilfried Zaha, Kai-Kai hit a hat-trick for the development side earlier this month.

Got a taste of senior football on loan at Crawley last season, and may be given the chance to shine by Neil Warnock.
