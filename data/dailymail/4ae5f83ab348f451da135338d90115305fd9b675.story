Friend's account: ¿She lived with him of her own free will. She was not a prisoner,' however police arrested Garcia Tuesday and are pursuing kidnapping charges

The lawyer for a man accused of kidnapping a teenager and holding her captive for a decade- during which time they got married and had a child- is now alleging that the woman is making up the claims because the couple was in the process of breaking up.

The woman, whose name has not been released but is now 25-years-old, was reunited with her mother who then convinced her to go to authorities to report that she had been kidnapped.

Orange County prosecutors on Thursday filed five felony charges against the alleged abductor, Isidro Garcia, including rape and kidnapping to commit a sexual offense.

He did not enter a plea, and his arraignment was continued until June. He is being held on $1million bail.

Police
 described an ordeal during which the now 25-year-old woman — broken 
through mental, physical and sexual abuse — was moved at least four 
times and given multiple fake identities to hide her from family and 
authorities.

The woman, who 
police did not identify by name, said she often thought about escaping 
but stayed out of fear, even though in recent years she was not 
physically held captive.

She
 told police that Garcia said her mother was not looking for her and 
that if she contacted authorities, her family would be deported.

Then,
 in April, the woman got in touch with her mother after finding her 
sister on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday, Santa Ana Police Cpl. 
Anthony Bertagna said.

The 
mother showed the daughter news articles written at the time of her 2004
 disappearance to prove that she had gone to the police and filed a 
missing-persons report, according to Bertagna.

'The mother was able to show her that she was, in fact, looking for her,' Bertagna said.

The woman said in a television interview that she was overjoyed to be reunited with her family.

'I was very afraid about everything because I was alone,' she told KABC-TV.

When
 reached by phone by The Associated Press, the woman's mother said she 
had no comment because police told her not to speak with media.

Held for years: The top left apartment is the home where Isidro Garcia and his wife, who claims to have been held captive by him for a decade, were living in Bell Gardens, California

Police said that the woman, who they did not identify, had arrived in the U.S. from Mexico several months before her abduction and did not speak English at the time.

On Monday, she contacted police in the working-class city of Bell Gardens to report a domestic violence incident with Garcia. During that investigation, authorities realized her connection to the 2004 case.

'You can't go home. You're here illegally.
 You don't speak the language. Your mom's called the police. They will 
send you back. I'm your only hope'

-Isidro Garcia said to his 'wife', according to a Santa Ana police spokesman

Garcia forced the woman to marry in 2007 and fathered a daughter, now 3, with her, Santa Ana police said.

In
 Bell Gardens — near Los Angeles and about 20 miles from where she 
originally vanished — stunned neighbors who knew the suspect as Tomas 
Medrano found the woman's portrait of him hard to reconcile with the man
 they knew.

'He treats her 
like a queen. He does his best to do whatever she wants,' next-door 
neighbor Maria Sanchez said Wednesday in Spanish after police announced 
Garcia's arrest.

The woman told the station that her neighbors believed Garcia was a good man because he provided for her.

'He
 worked hard for me and my daughter, and he bought everything I want. 
But I didn't want that,' she said with her mother, sister and daughter 
at her side. 'I need love from my family, not things.'

Under the radar: Neighbors say Isidro Garcia was a doting family man who sacrificed and worked two jobs to provide for his wife and daughter. But his wife says she was forced into marriage in 2007

Unthinkable: One neighbor described Garcia and 
the wife police believe he brainwashed into living with him for a decade
 and even having his baby as the 'perfect couple'

Fearful: Though the smiles and happy pictures, police see a woman who was too terrified to go to authorities for years in the belief she or her family would be deported

'Every weekend they would go out, have fun, do what every normal family would do,' a different neighbor told NBC Los Angeles.

Another could not understand why the woman did not escape sooner if she felt threatened, saying: 'She has her own car and she could have easily driven to the police station and said "I don't feel safe."'

Bertagna said his department's investigation has concluded only a handful of facts.

The girl arrived from Mexico in February 2004 to join her mother and sister in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. She had entered the United States illegally.

Garcia was her mother's boyfriend. After one fight between the girl's mother and Garcia in August 2004, the girl's mother left the house and the girl went to a nearby park.

Garcia followed the girl. When he caught up with her, she said she had a headache and wanted to go home.

'He told her then, "You can't go home. You're here illegally. You don't speak the language. Your mom's called the police. They will send you back. I'm your only hope,"' Bertagna said.

Garcia gave her five pills that he said would help her headache but instead knocked her out. When the girl awoke, she was locked in a garage in Compton, a city between Santa Ana and Los Angeles.

'Happy' family: Neighbors are split over whether Garcia, his 'wife' and their son were normal and happy or living in fear of disobeying him

Home or prison: Garcia met the girl when she was 15-years-old and he was dating her mother

The mother 'filed a police report and 
for 10 years (police) did due diligence. But they were changing their 
names and dates of birth and physical locations so that made it 
exceedingly difficult,' Bertagna said.

In
 2007, Garcia got documents from Mexico that gave the girl a new name 
and date of birth. Using those documents, he married her at a 
courthouse.

Police said the woman tried to escape twice but was severely beaten.

'He worked hard for her'

-Lourdes Hernandez, the babysitter for the couple's child

Elizabeth
 Smart, who was kidnapped from her Utah bedroom at 14 and held captive 
for nine months, told The Associated Press that people cannot know what 
victims are going through and should not question why the woman didn't 
escape sooner.

'We don't 
know what these evil people are holding over them — whether it's their 
families' lives, their lives, whatever it is,' Smart said.

Marisa Cianciarulo, a law professor at Chapman University, said immigrants who came to the United States illegally are vulnerable to certain kinds of manipulation.

'The threat that 'I am going to get your family deported' is a very real threat,' Cianciarulo said. 'Any interaction with law enforcement, whether it is federal, local, can be seen as very threatening and frightening to undocumented immigrants.'

In addition, small acts of kindness — a bit of food, permission to use the bathroom — can create positive feelings within the victim that the captor then exploits, said Dr. Frank Ochberg, an expert on the psychology of captives.

Garcia lived in Bell Gardens for about four years. The family had the second-floor corner unit of a stucco apartment building in a quiet neighborhood across from a park.

Neighbors said Garcia always said hello, joked with neighbors and sometimes brought them fruit. His wife worked for a nearby janitorial service, and he held at least two jobs — including one making egg rolls — and also collected cardboard and recyclable items to sell.

Garcia said he wanted to save money so that his wife didn't have to work, said Lourdes Hernandez, who baby-sat their child for a year.

The family threw elaborate parties that included costumed characters and raffle giveaways. A video taken at their daughter's birthday party last year shows the mother with the girl in her arms, line-dancing behind her husband as he wiggles his hips.

Hernandez said the woman took Zumba classes in South Los Angeles and sometimes invited her along. She said she found the woman's story hard to believe.

'He worked hard for her,' she said.

Neighbors said the family took trips together to Disneyland and the beach, and even up north to visit Garcia's family.

'I'm astounded she waited so long to say something,' said Rita Salazar, who lived across the street from the couple.
