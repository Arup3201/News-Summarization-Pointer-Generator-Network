A picturesque fishery is on the market for £800,000 - although you'll have to share it with a 48lb giant known as Butt Head.

Pendle View Fisheries, in Lancashire's Ribble Valley, includes three lakes, a house, two holiday lets, a cage, workshop and hatchery.

It is also home to the unusually-named scale-busting fish, weighing in at 48lbs 4oz, the county's largest.

Dave Harnick, one of the site's owners, 
explained the fish's unusual moniker: 'When it was smaller it got 
dropped and it had a dent in its head. It's not as visible now but 
someone gave it the nickname and it just stuck.

'He's known all over the country. People come from everywhere to target that fish.'

The mixed trout and coarse fishery, which borders the A59 near Barrow, had a turnover in excess of £123,000 last year.

Originally a fish farm, the fishery side of the business has been expanding since 2001 and appears regularly in specialist fishery publications.

Angling takes place in the three lakes in the backdrop of Pendle Hill, with the ‘Specimen Lake’ covering 8.3 acres.

The lake has a maximum depth of 13ft and holds the most carp stocks in the 15lb, 20lb and 30lb weight range, with pike reaching 25lbs, and other varieties include perch, roach, bream, chub and eels.

Fred Higham, chairman of Ribblesdale Angling Association, said: 'It’s a vital facility for the Ribble Valley because it brings people into the area.'

He added: 'They spend money when they are not fishing which benefits the area.

'I would hope that the new owners keep things more of less the same as it’s important for the borough.

'It will become a problem for us if it was changed to housing for example but I don’t think that will be the case.'

The other lakes at Pendle View are ‘Fly Lake’, which is just under an acre and is stocked weekly with rainbow, brown, blue, golden and tiger trout, and the 1.25 acre ‘Coarse Lake’.
