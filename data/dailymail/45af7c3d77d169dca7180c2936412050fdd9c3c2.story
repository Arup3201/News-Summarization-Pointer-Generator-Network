Ciaran Clark insists painful memories from previous cup upsets will spur on Aston Villa against Bournemouth and is confident his team can end their embarrassing scoring record.

The Irish defender played in the FA Cup third-round defeat to Sheffield United last January, as well as their exit at the hands of Millwall in 2013, and also the infamous humbling by Bradford in the League Cup semi-final the same year. With Villa scoring just 12 goals in all competitions this season, Championship high-fliers Bournemouth will travel to Birmingham with sights on another shock.

Eddie Howe’s side have actually scored the same number of goals in the city in one match as Villa have all season - following their 8-0 league win over Birmingham.

Villa’s eighth home goal so far, scored by Christian Benteke, came late on in the third-round win over Blackpool as supporters began to call for Paul Lambert’s head.

Clark insisted the mood in Villa’s camp remains healthy. ‘We’ve got too many good attacking players to not be scoring goals,’ he said. ‘We’re confident in ourselves and do it every day in training.

‘We’ll use the disappointment we have had from previous years to spur us on. It’s a horrible feeling walking into the dressing room knowing that you’ve been knocked out of the cup. It’s even worse when it’s a lower-league team, it’s devastating.’

Clark called on his team-mates to relieve the pressure on Lambert by producing a convincing win.

‘The manager does take a lot of the flak when the results aren’t going our way,’ he said. ‘We know as a group of lads that some of the games we have played in we should have got better results. I think it’s time for us to step up and start taking a lot of the responsibility ourselves.

‘The manager can only do so much in the week. The lads are all happy with what we’re doing leading up to the games. It’s about the time we get out on the pitch. Cup runs bring everyone together. We want to go as far as we can in this competition.’
