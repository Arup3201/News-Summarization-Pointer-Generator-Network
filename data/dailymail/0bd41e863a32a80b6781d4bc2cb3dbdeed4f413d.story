They risked their lives again and again on what Churchill described as ‘the worst journey in the world’.

The heroes of the Arctic Convoys ran the gauntlet of German warplanes and U-boats to keep the Soviet Union supplied on the Eastern Front.

Even Russia has awarded commemorative medals to acknowledge its gratitude to the surviving sailors, more than 3,000 of whose comrades were killed.

Yet David Cameron has refused to do the 
same. Yesterday, as the nation paid tribute to its war dead on 
Remembrance Sunday, disgusted veterans expressed anger that the Prime 
Minister had seemingly reneged on a pledge to introduce a specific 
Arctic Medal.

Hell in the Arctic: Apart from the appalling cold, British seamen were under constant threat from U-boats, warplanes and battleships

Betrayed: Commander Eddie Grenfell, 91, says the heroes of the Arctic Convoys feel like they've been 'knifed in the back once again'

‘We feel completely and utterly betrayed,’ said Commander Eddie Grenfell, 91, the leader of the Arctic Medal campaign. ‘How can Cameron stand up and support us in public but privately say we don’t deserve a medal? It’s two-faced and wrong.’

In opposition, the Tories pledged to introduce an Arctic Medal if they won power.

And in January this year, Mr Cameron indicated his continued support by telling MPs that the sailors who served on the Arctic Convoys had ‘missed out’.

‘Many of them are coming to the end of their lives and it would be good if we could do something more to recognise what they have done,’ he said.

However, in a letter to the Leader 
of the Commons, Sir George Young – a long-time supporter of the Arctic 
heroes’ 15-year battle – Mr Cameron now says the sailors have already 
been recognised with a medal for the separate naval campaign in the 
Atlantic.

He writes: 
‘It is clear that the Atlantic Star Medal that was extended to those who
served in the Arctic specified the convoys in its qualifying criteria. 
Those who took part in the Arctic Convoys have therefore been recognised
and received this medal as a mark of the nation’s gratitude.’

Ministry of Defence bureaucrats have repeatedly used this excuse to deny Arctic veterans their own award.

But
campaigners argue that 95 per cent of the 66,500 men who served in the 
Arctic Convoys had already earned the Atlantic Star before being 
conscripted on to the dreaded ‘Russian Run’.

Commander
Grenfell said: ‘This myth about us getting the Atlantic Star for the 
Arctic is completely wrong. Most of us had been drafted to the Arctic 
from service in the Home Fleet so we would have got the Atlantic Star 
anyway.

‘How can they say the Atlantic and 
Arctic were the same campaign? They were 800 miles apart and had 
completely different aims. We’ve come up against this nonsense time and 
time again.
‘I feel like we’ve been knifed in the back once again.’

Grenfell, from Portsea, Hampshire, added: ‘The convoy campaign, which 
helped keep Russia in the war, was the only major sea campaign of the 
Second World War not to be honoured by a medal.

‘The Africa Star was awarded to all those who spent one day in the sunny Mediterranean, whether in action or not.

‘Cameron
said in the summer, “When you make a promise to the leaders of the 
Third World [about aid] there is a moral case for honouring it”. Are 
Arctic war veterans not just as important?’

The Ministry of Defence has claimed a 
new Arctic medal would cost the taxpayer £14million. But medal experts 
believe the actual cost would be £600,000.

There are now just 200 Arctic convoy veterans alive. Many want a medal as their ‘dying wish’.Prince
Michael of Kent, a Honorary Rear Admiral of the Royal Naval Reserve, 
said: ‘The suffering they had to go through was absolutely indescribable
but they have kept their heads and kept themselves together.’

He said this year – the 70th anniversary of the first convoy – was the ‘right moment’ to award a medal.

In 2006, the Labour government said Arctic Convoy veterans could wear a small lapel badge – but refused to strike a medal.

But
it was deeply unpopular with veterans who claimed it belittled their 
sacrifice. Only 10,000 out of a potential 66,000 badges were applied 
for.

The campaign for 
an Arctic medal has been backed by 47 MPs from all parties who have 
signed a Parliamentary petition to put pressure on Downing Street.

Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war

Angus Robertson, the Scottish National Party leader at Westminster who tabled the motion, said: ‘Promises have been made to the Arctic Convoy veterans for a specific medal to recognise their heroism.

‘It is totally unacceptable to treat these brave veterans so shabbily by going back on those promises. The UK government must deliver.

‘The surviving veterans are now in their 80s and 90s. The question of whether an Arctic medal should be created should be dealt with quickly so that as many of them as possible can receive the medal they deserve.’

Tory MP Caroline Dinenage, who represents the coastal  town of Gosport in Hampshire, has said: ‘The selfless acts of bravery seen during the Arctic Campaign were nothing short  of inspirational.

‘Surely these acts of great heroism warrant the award of a medal in its own right.’The Coalition Government ordered the Ministry of Defence to review the medals system in July 2010.

Downing Street attempted yesterday to play down Mr Cameron’s apparent U-turn.

A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear that all World War Two veterans deserve the recognition they rightly deserve. In the letter, the Prime Minister was recognising, as a matter of fact, what had already been awarded. The Prime Minister is very clear on not pre-judging the review’s outcome.’

Bravery: Eric Alley made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943

By IAN DRURY

Battered by waves as high as houses, the ships sailed on through the darkness, fog and appalling cold of the Arctic winter.

But the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by German warplanes, battleships and U-boats.

A total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and munitions to the Soviet Union – allowing the Red Army to repel the Nazi invasion.

The cost in lives was horrific. More than 3,000 UK seamen were killed in the treacherous waters of the Arctic Ocean as they undertook the terrifying trips to keep Russia supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front.

In total, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945.

But the cost had the Arctic convoys not succeeded would have been worse: Nazi Germany would very probably have won the Second World War.

Churchill proposed the convoys following Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s invasion of Russia.

Cabinet documents reveal that Britain’s greatest prime minister promised to supply Stalin ‘at all costs’. He knew that if Russia fell, the full weight of the Nazi military machine would be targeted at the West.

Over four years, the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes, 5,000 tanks and other battlefield vehicles, ammunition, fuel, food, medicine and further emergency supplies. Because Norway and the Baltic states had been captured by Germany, the only way to get the goods to Russia was through the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel, both inside the Arctic Circle.

The first convoys set off from Iceland and Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. Two or three reached their destination unscathed. But then the Germans ‘got wise’ to the missions, said Eric Alley, 88, who served as a radar operator on HMS Inglefield.

‘After they woke up, all hell broke loose. They shifted all their most able Luftwaffe squadrons and U-boats to Norway and we’d be under constant attack from the air and sea,’ said Mr Alley, from Weymouth, Dorset.

‘You’d hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear. Once I was moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion. I saw a column of smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink. The poor blighters on board didn’t stand a chance. We heard ships call for help but couldn’t do anything about it.’

Mr Alley, who made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943, said conditions on board were ‘pretty terrible’.

He learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder.

The final convoy departed from the Clyde on May 12, 1945, and arrived at Kola Inlet, near Murmansk, on May 20. It sailed back into Glasgow ten days later.

Victory in Europe had been declared on May 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the Arctic convoys.
