The Welsh Secretary has been branded ‘lazy’ and ‘shameful’ after he used a chauffeur-driven Jaguar to travel 100 metres from his office to Downing Street and then back again.

David Jones was seen taking the short trip to yesterday’s Cabinet Meeting in his ministerial car even though it would have taken just a few minutes to walk

His chauffeur stayed outside Number 10 for 90 minutes and then drove him back to his office.

Stone's throw: The short journey between Downing Street and the Wales Office is an estimated 100 metres

Arriving: The Conservative MP pictured being dropped off at Downing St as his car is searched having just driven the short distance from his office

The Wales Office is one of the closest
departments to Downing Street. The short trip is around 100 metres and 
is a couple of minutes on foot.

But a witness said that Mr Jones has been regularly taking the short journey in his chauffeur-driven car.

The
silver Jaguar XJ used by Mr Jones, which is the same model as that used
by the Prime Minister, was seen waiting for him outside his office this
morning.

Mr Jones got in 
carrying a small red ringbinder and he travelled the short distance down
Whitehall to the gates of Downing Street.

The
car was stopped to be searched by police and Mr Jones got out of the 
car and walked the last few metres to the Prime Minister’s official 
residence.

The car was then parked outside the front door of Number 10 ready for Mr Jones to make the return journey back to his office.

Reading time: The Wales Office said that Mr Jones had taken the car as he was reading 'Cabinet papers and briefing' until his arrival at Downing Street for the weekly Cabinet meeting 

After
driving out of Downing Street the car performed a U-turn on Whitehall 
so that Mr Jones could be dropped at the front door of the office 
without having to drive to the top of the road at Trafalgar Square to 
turn around.

Many ministers are not thought to use their official cars for short journeys around Westminster.

Yesterday
other ministers including Vince Cable, Andrew Lansley, Chris Grayling 
and Jeremy Hunt were all seen walking to the Cabinet Meeting.

The Wales Office said that Mr Jones had taken a ministerial car to Downing Street because he was working until the last minute.

A
spokesman said: ‘The Secretary of State for Wales, Mr David Jones, did 
travel by car to Cabinet today as he was reading Cabinet papers and 
briefing until his arrival at Downing Street.’

Return: After the politician was taken to Downing Street his driver waited for Mr Jones and he was taken back to the Wales Office after 90 minutes

Robert
Oxley, campaign manager at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The image of
a minister taking a chauffeur driven car a 100 metres makes politicians
look even more out of touch than they already are.

‘This
journey is particularly galling given how much it costs to fill up at 
the pumps thanks to tax. The Secretary of state clearly hasn’t been 
listening to the Department of Health’s advice on walking more.’

Mr Jones was widely criticised on Twitter with comments calling him ‘lazy’, ‘shameful’ and a ‘typical politician.

One person wrote: ‘The incredible arrogance of these people, who elected them? They should be ashamed of their decision.’

The
incident revives memories of John Prescott’s use of a chauffeur-driven 
Jaguar to travel a few hundred yards from his hotel to the Labour party 
conference venue in 1999.

Similar: John Prescott used a chauffeur-driven Jaguar to travel a few hundred yards from his hotel to the Labour party conference venue in 1999, saying it was to protect his wife's hair from the wind

The reason he gave then was that he wanted to protect his wife’s hair from the wind.

David
Cameron pledged to crackdown on the use of ministerial cars after he 
came into office, but Mr Jones is the just latest minister to be 
ridiculed for his use of a government car.

The
minister responsible for rail fares, Simon Burns, was last month 
accused of using a £80,000-a-year chauffeur-driven car to make the 35 
mile journey between his home in Essex and Westminster.

In
2010, Caroline Spelman, the former Environment Secretary, was found to 
have used an official car for a 500-metre journey from her home to her 
Westminster office.

Mr Jones was elected as the Conservative MP for Clwyd West in 2005 and was promoted to the job of Welsh Secretary in September.

Last year he claimed a total of £34,065.57 in expenses, including £2,961.20 on claims for journeys made in his own car.
