Napoli and Swansea are in talks over the transfer of Spanish striker Michu on a season-long loan.

Michu has not travelled with Swansea to the United States for their pre-season tour.

Bahia International, the company that represents Michu, confirmed to Press Association on Wednesday that the clubs are in negotiations with a view to Michu joining Napoli on a one-season loan deal.

Target: Napoli are in talks with Swansea over a season-long loan for Spanish striker Michu

Regular: Michu scored 22 goals in his first season after his £2.2m move from Rayo Vallecano in 2012

Reinforcements: Rafael Benitez is looking to strengthen his Napoli squad for a Serie A title push

Michu moved to Swansea from Rayo Vallecano in a £2.2m transfer deal in the summer of 2012 and was the club’s top scorer with 22 goals in his first season.

The former Celta Vigo star struggled with knee and ankle problems which limited him to just 15 starts in the Premier League in the 2013-14 season.

The 28-year-old Michu is under contract with the Swans until 2017.

Napoli’s Spanish coach Rafa Benitez is looking to strengthen their attacking line ahead of next season’s Champions League campaign. The Naples outfit finished third in Serie A last season.
