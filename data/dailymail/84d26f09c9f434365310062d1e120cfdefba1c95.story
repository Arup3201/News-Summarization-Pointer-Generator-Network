The iPhone is to face its biggest challenge for supremacy in the smartphone market this week with the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy.

In what has been described as the most eagerly awaiting technology release of the year, the Galaxy S4 will be unveiled in New York on Wednesday and rumours are the device will feature eye control.

The S4’s predecessor, the S3, already had a feature called Smart Stay that detected if users were looking at the screen.

Revolutionary: The Samsung S4 is set to launch on Wednesday in New York with rumoured features such as wireless charging and eye-controlled scrolling

But the S4 is expected to have 
revolutionary functions such as ‘eye pause’ and ‘eye scroll’, which will
 let users scroll around apps and websites simply by moving their eyes. 

Since
 its launch last year, the S3 briefly outsold the iPhone 4S but after 
the release of the iPhone 5, Apple have regained the top spot.

However, the S4 is predicted to 
become the biggest seller when it hits the stores in a few weeks thanks 
to rumoured technological improvements such as wireless charging,

It
 is also expected to be powered by an eight core processing chip, 
compared to the iPhone’s two, and to have a larger screen - 5in compared
 to 4.8in on the S3.

Old rivals: There was fierce competition between Apple's iPhone 4s, left, and Samsung's Galaxy S III, right, last year as the battle between the two technology companies continues

Other leaks suggest it will have a 13 megapixel camera, as opposed to the iPhone’s eight.

Francisco
 Jeronimo, from technology analysis firm IDC, said: ‘Apple is not the 
one leading the market. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new Samsung 
device sells more than the new Apple device over the next two years.’

The S4’s launch ceremony will be held at the famous Radio City music Hall and will be broadcast live in Times Square.

South
 Korean electronics giant Samsung have released a few teaser 
advertisements for the phone, which show a boy’s face being lit up by a 
golden glow as he opens a box containing the S4, with the catchline ‘one
 of the most amazing products to hit the market since TVs went colour.’
