Champions League holders Real Madrid will face local rivals Atletico Madrid - the team they beat in last season's final - in the quarter-finals of this season's competition. 

Los Blancos needed extra-time to beat Diego Simeone's men in Lisbon May but the two Madrid sides will face each other again next month as they look to make it all the way to Berlin.

Carlo Ancelotti's side scraped past Schalke to reach the last eight, while Atletico required a penalty shootout to see off Bayer Leverkusen at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday.
