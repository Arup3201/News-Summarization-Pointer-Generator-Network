An Indian schoolboy has become a limbo legend - by roller-skating under 39 cars in a row.

It took six-year-old Gagan Satish just 29 seconds to cover a distance of nearly 230 feet with his face just five inches from the ground.

The skater, from Bangalore, India, is now vowing to take on the world after becoming a celebrity in his home city and inspiring others to take up the bizarre sport.

Gagan Satish's incredible flexibility allows him to skate under cars by doing the splits while moving

He set himself the challenge of going under increasing numbers of vehicles as he mastered the skill

He has now broken the world record for the furthest distance skated in limbo by emerging from under 39 cars

His astonishing feat is yet to be recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, but is in the Indian version

He said: 'I love skating. I have been doing it since I was three years old. My next goal is to skate underneath 100 cars. I also want to go to the Olympics.'

Gagan, who unwrapped his first pair of rollerskates on his third birthday, was initially rejected by his local club for being too young.

But his mother Hema Satish, 28, was determined he would be taken on.

'We could see that his body was very flexible,' she said. 'After that we decided to send him for proper coaching.

'We always knew he would do well. Hopefully this is just the beginning of his sporting career.'

The housewife said her son had been injured many times but always got up again to continue.

She added: 'While practicing and training, he has been hurt many times. But he never backs out.

His parents Rajanna and Hema say they are very proud of his skill, which has netted him scores of medals

They say he goes out into the streets of Bangalore, India and practices as soon as he gets home from school

Despite having a number of crashes, they say he always gets straight back up and is always keen to improve

She said: 'During a limbo skating session a few months ago, he even had cuts on face because he was too close to the ground.

'He was bleeding also. But he still continued and stopped skating only after the session ended.'

His father Rajanna Satish, who runs a washing machine repair centre, said he was nervous throughout his son's record attempt, which was filmed by a local camera crew, but overjoyed he had succeeded.

'We are really lucky to have a son like Gagan,' the 30-year-old added.

'He has been blessed by God. And we thank God for giving him such grace and talent.'

Gagan's record-breaking stunt has been recognised by the India Book of Records as the 'Farthest Distance In Limbo Skating Under Cars' - but the feat has yet to be ratified by the Guinness Book of World Records.

In achieving his goal, Gagan shattered the previous record of 157 feet set two years ago by Shreeya Deshpande, then five, in Kolhapur, India.

His amazing talents have seen him become something of a celebrity in his home city, where he has been filmed

Locals know him for his love of skating and have supported his latest world record attempt

The six-year-old said: 'My next goal is to skate underneath 100 cars. I also want to go to the Olympics'

Gagan follows a rigorous routine and never gives his training classes a miss.

'He gets up at 5am. Then we take him for coaching classes. He practices there for a few hours. After that he goes to school,' said his father

'In the evenings also, after coming back from school, he starts skating out in the street.'

They spend two hours each day on speed-training and muscle flexibility to help Gagan pick up as much speed as possible before he ducks into the limbo position.

It was the culmination of three months specialist training with his coach Yatish Gowda.

Mr Gowda, who says he has believed in Gagan from the start, said: 'He has been working very hard for this for a long time. This is a great achievement and we are all very proud.'
