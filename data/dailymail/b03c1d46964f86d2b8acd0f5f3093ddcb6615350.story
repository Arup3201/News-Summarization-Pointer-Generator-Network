Romelu Lukaku has been offered to Atletico Madrid as part of Chelsea’s attempts to seal a deal for Diego Costa.

But it is understood the Belgian will have to overcome his reservations about moving to Spain because of the risk of racist abuse and the soft punishment Villarreal received when a fan threw a banana at Dani Alves.

Costa is Jose Mourinho’s prime transfer target this summer and the Chelsea manager wants business concluded quickly.

The 25-year-old, who is expected to make the Spain squad for the World Cup, has scored 27 goals this season but has a buy-out clause in his contract of about £32million.

Chelsea are exploring ways of agreeing a deal and Lukaku has been put forward as an option for part-exchange.

The 21-year-old, brought to Stamford Bridge for £18m from Anderlecht in 2011, has scored 16 goals on loan at Everton this season and looks to have no future at Chelsea.

He engaged in a war of words with Mourinho at the end of last year with the pair at odds about the manner of his temporary departure.

Lukaku suggested it had been his manager’s idea, while the Portuguese hinted at the opposite.

Lukaku then said he would like to stay at Everton for another season, but Mourinho responded by insisting he would decide the player’s fate.

Now, with Mourinho wanting a more experienced figure spearheading his team, Lukaku is being offered as a makeweight.

But despite Atletico’s pole position in La Liga and place in the Champions League final, Spain’s repeated controversies with racism have made Lukaku reluctant to join the club.

Villarreal were fined just under £10,000 after a supporter threw a banana at Barcelona full-back Alves, who then sparked an internet craze by picking up the fruit and taking a bite.
