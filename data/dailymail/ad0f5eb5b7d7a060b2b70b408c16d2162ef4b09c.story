A pair of high school footballers in Connecticut have been charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, just days after two star players in Steubenville, Ohio, were convicted of rape in a case that shook the nation.

Torrington High School football players Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio, both 18, are accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes in an investigation that began last month. Both have pleaded not guilty.

Since the alleged abuse, the young victim, who hasn't been named, has been taunted on social media sites by dozens of classmates who are upset at the claims against the football stars.

The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like boys is a sentence.'

After The Register Citizen published his tweet, the same user said on Twitter that he 'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio, not that the girls aren't victims my point is.'

Another bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 times and received six favorites.

A judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still under investigation, and when a young victim is involved.

The warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to the Citizen.

The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online.

Gonzalez and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a hazing scandal last year that is still under investigation, according to the Citizen.

Gonzalez, who was named the team's Most Valuable Player, was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money.

Jeffrey Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of their age. Gonzalez has pleaded not guilty in that case.

Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges.

He told the Citizen he 'reeled the kid in' when he became aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the line. As a coach I was doing something right.'

Ohio: The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online

Coach: Athletic Director Mike McKenna said the incidents were not reflective of the culture of the football team

Culture: Both this and the Ohio rape case have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools

Dunaj said, however, that sexual 
assault charges are a different matter, insisting he would kick the 
18-year-old off the team if he were still in the role and Gonzalez had 
another season ahead of him.

'My
 process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high 
school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if 
you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the 
newspaper.

Torrington athletics director has 
insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid 
culture within the football team.

Athletic
 Director Mike McKenna told the Citizen: 'If you think there's some wild
 band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're 
mistaken.'

According to McKenna, a student 
athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' 
However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be 
enough.

He told the newspaper that he personally considered a violent felony worthy of a suspension.

In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16.

He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police.

Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools.

A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.'

The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens.

Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim.

Toribio is scheduled to be in court April 23. Gonzalez is scheduled to be back in court on April 2.
