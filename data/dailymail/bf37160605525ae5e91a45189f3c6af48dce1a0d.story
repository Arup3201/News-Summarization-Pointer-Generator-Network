Royal Bank of Scotland was warned by the government today that it should not go ahead with paying £576million in staff bonuses while it is still recieving 'life support' from the taxpayer.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that while the bank's survival depends on the generosity of the British public, it had to be 'restrained, sensible and responsible' in setting pay deals.

The troubled bank reignited the row over pay when it revealed plans for huge bonuses, including £237million for its investment bankers, despite slumping into the red with an £8.2billion loss.

The bonus pot is slightly smaller than the £679million haul for 2012, although this in part was a result of job losses from its investment 
banking team.

Mr Clegg said RBS 'is not a normal bank' because it is 'not able to stand on its own two feet'.

He told ITV's Daybreak: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and, you know, it needs to continue to come down.

'They are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet, at the moment they are not.

'As long as you’re there because the British public have been generous to keep you in existence, be restrained, be sensible, be responsible in the kind of remuneration. 

'I think in RBS’ case it’s different, 
of course there will be bonuses but it is really important those bonuses
 are as restrained and limited as possible.'

The taxpayer-backed lender agreed the 
bonus windfall with UK Financial Investments, the body charged with 
managing government stakes in banks, according to Sky News.

The losses of the taxpayer-backed lender, which is just over 80 per cent owned by the Government, have widened significantly from £5.3billion in 2012.

It includes  £3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal-related charges and a £4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘bad bank’.

Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said:  'Taxpayers will be incredulous that such large bonuses continue to be paid out at a time when huge losses are being made.

'With bumper bonuses across a number of banks this year the government should now repeat Labour’s successful tax on bank bonuses.

'George Osborne should also make clear now that he would reject any request from RBS later this year for approval to pay bonuses of more than 100 per cent of salary.

'At a time when ordinary families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to business is down it cannot be justified.'

Admission: Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS (left), says the bank is paying for past mistakes. Long-lasting damage was done to the bank by Fred 'the Shred' Goodwin (right), who was in charge between 2001 and 2009

But chief executive Ross McEwan 
outlined a revival plan to make the bank ‘smaller, simpler and smarter’ 
that will see it shrink from seven divisions to three and overhaul its 
service and products for retail customers.

The
 massive black hole illustrates the long-lasting damage done by Fred 
‘the Shred’ Goodwin's leadership before the bank was bailed out with 
£45billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008.

Mr McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester at the start of October 2013, said recently that the bank and its directors were paying the price for past errors.

‘I know this team is not responsible for past mistakes but we are running the company and have to show we take accountability seriously,’ he said. ‘Fronting up to our past mistakes is very expensive, but RBS is now a stronger bank.’

He did not name Mr Goodwin, who in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown.

But he blamed the aggressive expansionism of the bank, one of its key characteristics under Mr Goodwin’s leadership.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said RBS was 'in a different category' from other banks because it is largely taxpayer-owned and should show restraint on pay and bonuses.

Mr Clegg told ITV1's Daybreak: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on a life-support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn't be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses.

'The overall amount has been coming down. It needs to continue to come down. They are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet. At the moment they are not.'
