Jose Mourinho has spoken of the bond between himself and his new rival at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal, ahead of the upcoming season.

The Chelsea boss was assistant to the then Barcelona manager between 1997 and 2000, before Mourinho took up his first managerial post at Benfica and Van Gaal left for his first stint as Holland coach.

And although Mourinho admits contact between the pair has been limited since their spell at the Nou Camp, he told Sport magazine of his utmost respect for his former mentor.

'We worked together, then we went our separate professional ways,' said the 51-year-old Portuguese.

'But there will always be a fantastic relation between us. I like him a lot and I know he likes me a lot too.'

Seventh-placed United finished 18 points behind Mourinho's third-placed Blues last season and Van Gaal will be eager at the very least to significantly reduce that gap in his first season at Old Trafford.

Mourinho watched the Dutchman's first United press conference and drew some insightful conclusions from the words and demeanour of the man he met in the 2010 Champions League final when his Inter Milan side beat Van Gaal's Bayern Munich.

'I think he was very Louis,' said Mourinho. 'The Louis I know, by which I mean he was very honest, very pragmatic.

'Sometimes people say there is a bit of arrogance but no, when you are honest and direct and say what you want and what you think you are not arrogant - you are just honest.'

Mourinho has often used a similar defence for himself when he has been labelled as arrogant by his critics, but he insists that, despite their similarities, he is not an exact replica of Van Gaal.

'Louis is Louis and I am Jose and each one is unique,' added Mourinho. 'There are no points to compare us.

'But the training philosophy and methodology... well, I learn with him. I also developed a lot of my own ideas, but I would lie if I didn't say I learned something with Louis, because I did.'

Mourinho and Van Gaal go head-to-head at Old Trafford on October 26 and again at Stamford Bridge on April 18.
