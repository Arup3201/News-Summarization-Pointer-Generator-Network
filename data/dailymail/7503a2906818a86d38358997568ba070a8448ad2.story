A pensioner travelled the world and splashed out on expensive works of art while falsely claiming more than £36,000 in benefits, a court was told.

Susan Mary Robinson, from Llangennith, near Swansea, travelled to Hawaii, Bali and New York and spent 'a large amount of money' on art but neglected to mention she had £20,000 sitting in a bank account.

At Swansea Magistrates Court, 68-year-old Robinson admitted dishonestly claimed housing and council tax benefits and pension credits for almost six years.

Julie Sullivan, for the prosecution, said Robinson had inherited the cash from her mother, and had told investigators it was not for her benefit but for her grandchildren.

However, inquiries showed she had used it for trips to New York, Hawaii, Bali, Canada and the south of France, as well as to places in Britain, and had spent 'a large amount of money on art works and various other purchases'.

Robinson pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to notify the authorities of circumstances affecting her claims for benefits and pension credits between 2007 and 2013, the total overpayment she received during that period was £36,573.42.

Probation officer Fred Matthews, who had interviewed Robinson about the background to the claims, told the court she had misunderstood the system.

He said: 'Miss Robinson tells me there was a misunderstanding not a deliberate attempt to defraud the public purse.'

He added that she had always worked and was 'not au fait with how the system worked' and felt a degree of shame about what had happened.

Nick Devonald, for Robinson, said the ordeal of being arrested, charged and taken to court was a punishment in itself, as was the upset his client had caused her own family.

He urged magistrates to suspend any custodial sentence.

The court heard Robinson has no previous convictions and has already paid back £11,000.

Magistrates handed her a four month jail sentence for each of the two offences, suspended for 18 months.

She was also told to pay £85 in prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
