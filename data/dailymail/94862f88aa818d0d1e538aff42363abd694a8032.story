The Chancellor insists there will be no political tax breaks because Britain must ‘stay the course to prosperity’

George Osborne has ruled out any traditional pre-election giveaways in this week’s Autumn Statement.

The Chancellor insists there will be no political tax breaks because Britain must ‘stay the course to prosperity’. ‘What you’re going to see is me avoiding the mistakes of Labour chancellors before elections with unfunded giveaways that lead to economic problems after the election,’ he said.

A report out today warns that the Government will have to borrow £9billion more than expected this year as tax receipts disappoint.

This means the Chancellor will not be able to deliver the budget surplus he has promised until 2019-20 – a year late. And it casts doubt on his plans for £7billion of tax cuts for the middle classes after the election.

‘The improvement in the public finances is in danger of not just stalling but going into reverse,’ says Marin Beck in the report for the Ernst & Young Item Club. ‘With the fiscal cupboard bare, the Chancellor will have little room for manoeuvre.’

Mr Osborne can expect a boost from the Office for Budget Responsibility this week with an upward revision of economic growth forecasts. 

But the Item Club warns ‘that’s where the good news is likely to end’ as subdued wage growth and the big increase in the tax free allowance to £10,500 hits tax receipts.

Borrowing hit a record high of £153billion in 2009-10 as the last Labour government lost control of the public finances in the Great Recession. The deficit fell to £97.5billion last year but progress has stalled and the Government borrowed £64.1billion in the first seven months of this fiscal year. That is £3.7billion more than in the equivalent period of 2013-14.

The increase in borrowing means the Chancellor will struggle to meet his target of cutting the deficit by another £11billion this year – with the Item Club expecting it to come in at £95.5billion.

‘With just five months to go it appears virtually impossible for the Government to achieve the OBR’s current forecast for borrowing in 2014-15,’ Mr Beck said.

Labour leader Ed Miliband will today claim that the Tories’ failure to tackle what he calls a cost-of-living crisis has helped cost the Exchequer £116.5billion since 2010.

The price tag – equivalent to almost £4,000 for every taxpayer – is based on new research from the House of Commons Library being published by Labour.

Depressed pay combined with soaring housing costs and the failure to tackle the causes of increased welfare bills, means tax receipts have fallen short by £66 billion, national insurance contributions are £25.5billion lower than expected and spending on social security is £25billion higher than planned.

‘For all the Government’s boasts about a belated economic recovery, there are millions of families still caught in the most prolonged cost-of-living crisis for a century. For them this is a joyless and payless recovery,’ Mr Miliband will say.

But Mr Osborne told the BBC: ‘We’ve created more jobs in this country under this government than the rest of Europe put together.

‘We’ve had the fastest fall in unemployment in this country’s history. So those are real outcomes for real people.

‘We shouldn’t face this false choice of either bankrupting the country or having decent public services.’
