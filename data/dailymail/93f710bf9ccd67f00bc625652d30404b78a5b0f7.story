A mother who watched her cop son gunned down in front of her, his wife and his children allegedly at the hands of two illegal immigrants has vowed not to rest until his 'worthless piece of s**t' killers are dead.'

Heartbroken Marie Vega was on a family fishing trip with her husband Javier, son Javier Jr., his wife Paola and their three children when they were ambushed by two armed Mexican illegal immigrants who have been deported SIX times before in total.

Javier Jr and his father bravely tried to fight them off, but the off-duty Border Patrol Agent was fatally shot in the chest and Javier Sr was blasted in the hip.

Revenge: Marie Vega took to Facebook 
to promise that she will avenge her son's death. In an emotional Facebook post she said that she wished she could have died instead of him

Mexican nationals Gustavo Tijernia, 30 and Ismael Hernandez, 40 fled the scene and were arrested hours later after a huge man hunt.

The ruthless killing has again highlighted the border crisis plaguing the Obama administration which is struggling to contain a huge wave of illegal immigration across the border with Mexico which has stretched authorities to breaking point this year.

On Tuesday devastated Marie posted an emotionally charged message on her Facebook page alongside a picture of her beloved son.

Marie, who works as a photographer, wrote: 'My sweet sweet baby. I failed you oh sweet child of mine. I was supposed to protect you and keep you safe. I failed to save your life. I wish a million times I had died and not you. You are my life, my heart was ripped out when I lost you. I will not rest until these worthless pieces of s*** are dead.'

Hundreds of law enforcement officers turned out for Javier Vega's mass, held at St. Francis Xavier Church in La Feria on Thursday. The car lot was packed with State Trooper Vehicles, local police cars and SUV's from Javier's colleagues in The Border Patrol.

His devastated family, including his injured father, Javier Snr arrived in a white limousine, behind a hearse.

As his coffin was carried out at the end of the ceremony, officers held up the flags of The Border Patrol, The US Marine Corp and The Stars and Stripes.

Javier was a Border Patrol veteran of six years and had previously served in the U.S. Marine Corp, like his brother Jordy.

On Sunday he travelled to his favorite fishing hole around 20 minutes north of La Feria with his mother, father, wife and three boys Javier Vega III, Jiovanni, and Jarod.

Tijernia and Hernandez pulled up to the secluded spot in a car and tried to rob them at gun point.

When Javier bravely reached for his weapon, they shot him in the chest. TheBlaze reported
 that his last words were 'keep shooting, dad'. It is believed Javier 
Sr then grabbed the gun and shot at the robbers, but was blasted in the
 hip. He has now been released from hospital.

Willacy
 County Sheriff Larry Spence told TheBlaze that Marie even picked up an 
AR-15 rifle and shot at the suspects' vehicle as the suspects fled.

They
 eventually crashed their car and took refuge in a neighbor's house. The
 home owner alerted Border Patrol officers to their location and scores 
of agents moved in to arrest them.

They
 were arraigned on Tuesday and charged with capital murder, attempted 
capital murder, four counts of aggravated robbery and tampering with 
evidence.

Fox News has reported Tijernia - who is the alleged gunman - could also face charges in connection with a string of similar attacks in Cameron County over the last six weeks, believed to be linked to the infamous Gulf Cartel.

The ruthless crime syndicate is one of the oldest, most established in Mexico and is based out of the suspects' home town of Matamoros, directly across the border from Brownsville, Texas.

Its 
primary business is drug smuggling, but it also operates through 
protection rackets, assassinations, extortions and kidnappings. It is 
believed it has recently branched out into robbing U.S. citizens, before
 smuggling their belongings back across the border.

Fox
 News claims sources have informed them Tijernia is expected to be 
charged with four counts of aggravated robbery and one conspiracy 
organized crime charge.

They
 state one of Tijernia's earlier victims was another off-duty Border 
Patrol agent who was also out fishing when he was robbed.

The
 crew would fire warning shots at fishermen, before ordering them to 
hand over jewelry, cash and keys to their cars, Fox News states.

On Tuesday the station also reported both Tijernia, 30 and Hernandez, 40 had been arrested and deported numerous times.

According 
to court records, Tijerina, who also goes by the name Tijerina-Sandoval,
 pleaded guilty to entering the U.S. illegally on July 9, 2007. He was 
given a 30-day sentence with credit for time served and charged a $10 
fee. 

Three
 months later, on Oct. 4, he was again found guilty of entering the 
country illegally and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and $10 fee. In a
 criminal complaint, he said he entered the U.S.on Sept. 1 and was 
confronted by border patrol agents near Weslaco, Texas, on Oct. 3. He 
had waded across the Rio Grande River near Progreso, Mexico, court 
records show.

A
 year later, on Oct. 25, 2008, he again entered the U.S by crossing the 
river. On Nov. 18, 2008, he was given 90 days in jail and another $10 
special assessment fee.

On Dec. 15, 2009, Tijerina was indicted by a grand jury on charges of entering the U.S. illegally yet again.

The
 indictment says he 'had previously been denied admission, excluded, 
deported and removed, knowing and unlawfully was present in the United 
States having been found near Edinburg, Texas.'

Court
 records say he had not obtained permission from the U.S. attorney 
general and the secretary of homeland security to reapply for admission 
into the U.S.

A warrant was issued for his arrest stating he faced up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

He was held without bond on Jan. 26, 2010 and was given nine months in jail and fined $100.

Sources confirmed to Fox News that these cases involved the same Tijerina who is accused of slaying of Javier Vega.

The sources also said Hernandez, the second suspect, has been deported twice for entering the U.S. illegally.

These shocking revelations come at a time when the government is under intense scrutiny over its immigration policy and control of the U.S. border with Mexico.

President Obama faces a growing humanitarian crisis as more than 57,000 children have arrived unaccompanied at the border. Lawmakers have expressed concern that gang members and criminals  have slipped in as authorities struggle to deal with the flood.

Obama has called on Congress to quickly approve his request for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to deal with the crisis amid calls from some Republicans to deploy the National Guard at the border.

Javier Vega's murder has sent shockwaves through the local community.

Yesterday 
Border Patrol's Chief Patrol Agent Kevin Oaks said: 'Words cannot 
express our sorrow for the loss of our brother, when we lose one of our 
own, it feels as if we've lost a beloved member of our own family.

'I
 wish to express to his family and friends my deepest condolences. May 
the peace that comes from the memories of the time you shared together, 
comfort you now and in the difficult days ahead.'

'The Kingsville Station is at a loss,'said Kingsville Station Acting Patrol Agent in Charge Arnold Perez.

Widow: Javier Jr. is survived by his wife Paola Vega and their three sons. The National Border Patrol Council has set up a memorial fund for them

'Not
 only did Javier strive to be the best agent and K-9 handler, but he 
also made it a point to develop and truly care about his friendships.'

The National Border Patrol Council has set up a memorial fund for Javier's widow and his three children.
