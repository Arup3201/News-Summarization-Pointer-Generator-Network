French coach Loic Courteau will not be re-uniting with former pupil Amelie Mauresmo on Andy Murray's coaching team.

Courteau, who spent six years coaching Mauresmo, said in December he had spoken to his compatriot about taking up a role in Murray's camp following the departure of assistant coach Dani Vallverdu.

However, the 51-year-old is set to continue working with France's Julien Benneteau, who lost in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters after his four-set defeat to Benjamin Becker in Melbourne, Benneteau said Courteau would not be linking up with Murray.

'Nice things are still ahead for us,' added the 33-year-old, who finished 2014 at a career-high 25th in the world and won the men's doubles title in the French Open.

Speaking in December, Courteau had told L'Equipe: 'A few weeks ago I had discussions with Amelie, who spoke with Andy. I had not been able to talk directly with him, as he was leaving the Philippines [after playing in the International Premier Tennis League].

'The plan was to work with him in the year, with a base in England. For the moment, it does not happen. I'm not saying it will not happen, because I do not know. But at the Australian Open, I will be with Julien.'
