Saudi Arabia has carried out its first execution under the rule of newly enthroned King Salman, with the beheading of a convicted serial rapist.

Moussa al-Zahrani, 45, had been found guilty of 'luring underage girls, intoxicating them, forcing them to watch pornographic videos and then physically and sexually assaulting them', an Interior Ministry statement said.

The beheading, which took place in Jeddah, has caused outrage on social media after al-Zahrani, an Arabic teacher, maintained his innocence, and claimed he had been framed by police.

Al-Zahrani, a father-of-six, was found guilty of assaulting young girls  a string of attacks in Jeddah in 2011.

He maintained his innocence throughout the trial and two later appeals, and last year, al-Zahrani appealed in a 20-minute video for the late  King Abdullah to intervene.

The video, which was spread on social media in Saudi Arabia, saw al-Zahrani claim that he was being framed by police and that one of his accusers, his neighbour of ten years was also a police investigator in the case.

An Arabic hashtag on Twitter, 'We are all Moussa al-Zahrani' garnered thousands of comments by Saudis with conflicting opinions over the case.

Al-Zahrani's relatives have appeared on Saudi talk shows, saying the case was riddled with inconsistencies and that the judiciary did not weigh all the evidence.

They claimed a medical report found the neighbour's ten-year-old daughter had not been assaulted and that several cases of assault against young girls took place in Jeddah while al-Zahrani was already jailed.

Speaking after the execution, his brother, Hassan al-Zahrani said hat his brother could not have committed the crimes he was convicted of.

Al-Zahrani was one of 11 people beheaded in Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013.

Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim, convicted of raping and murdering her six-year-old stepdaughter, was heard screaming her innocence in graphic footage of the execution.

The incident sparked outrage in Saudi Arabia, but not  because of the beheading, but rather that the execution was filmed and posted online, where the woman's family might see it.

Saudi Arabia, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world, follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law and applies the death penalty for crimes such as murder, rape and witchcraft.   

The kingdom had the third-highest number of recorded executions in 2013, behind Iran and Iraq, Amnesty International says. 

A United Nations special rapporteur has said trials leading to the death penalty in Saudi Arabia are 'grossly unfair'.

Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are punishable by death in the oil-rich Gulf state, which is a close ally of Washington and a regular customer of both American and British arms companies.
