Gwyn Roberts, 45, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row

A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. 

Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. 

Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487.

The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. 

The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row.

Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487.

The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours.

The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia.

Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises.

Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum.

Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80.

Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment.

He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. 

But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home.

Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions.

'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients.

'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said.

The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. 

Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit.

He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue.

The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours

But Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'.

He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 

'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car.

'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.'

He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. 

The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again.
