The Marchioness of Worcester has said an organic diet and complementary medicines helped her beat cancer.

Speaking for the first time since she was diagnosed with breast and lymph cancer in 2009, she said an ‘alkaline diet’ free from alcohol, meat and processed food helped her through chemotherapy and radiotherapy by maintaining her strength.

The Marchioness, 54, said: ‘My doctor said he had never known anyone be quite so well, I would put it down to complementary medicine and alkalining my body.’

The Marchioness was one of the stars of detective show 'C.A.T.S. Eyes' alongside Jill Gascoine and Leslie Ash in the Eighties

An alkaline diet claims to prevent cancer by making body fluids less acidic. It is commonly used as an alternative medicine though medics question its effectiveness.

But the Marchioness, who was born Tracy Louise Ward and starred in the 1980s television detective series C.A.T.S. Eyes, told the Daily Telegraph she had ‘never felt better’.

She recommended everyone eat organic food as it has fewer pesticides, try a vegetarian diet with more raw vegetables and take supplements such as omega 3.

She said she had never spoken about her diagnosis before because it was ‘just so boring’. She added: ‘Why become obsessed by something so boring and negative when the world is such an interesting place?’

In 1987 the mother of three married the Marquis of Worcester, the eldest son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, who owns Badminton estate.

She revealed she sent her two sons and a daughter to Marlborough College – the school attended by Kate Middleton – only because she was expected to do so by her husband’s family. She said: ‘I did not want it but it was demanded in this family.

‘This country is the only country in the world where normal children are sent to boarding school, normally it is just problem children.’

She admitted she had problems at boarding school herself and was expelled several times.

She said the schools were elitist and failed to teach children about the real world.

The Marchioness, who is the great-granddaughter of the Earl of Dudley, said she would prefer money to be spent on state schools.

She said: ‘We are enslaved to earning enough money to send people to the boarding school club.

‘It would be great to be freed from that so that everyone’s children had a good education.

‘It makes a division in society. Wouldn’t it be better if we all had the time and money to make sure everybody’s school was good?’

The Marchioness, who prefers to be known as Tracy Worcester, campaigns against factory farming and donated to the bail money for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
