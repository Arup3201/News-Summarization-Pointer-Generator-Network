The body of an autistic 9-year-old Northern California girl last seen running naked from her family's vacation home has been found, authorities announced.

Clearlake police say divers found Mikaela Lynch's body in a muddy creek running near the family's home on Wednesday after the child took off from the yard three days ago after left briefly unattended.

Mikaela, who had the mental capacity of a 1-year-old, had been left outside for what authorities said was an 'unknown period of time.'

Tragic end: The hunt for Mikaela Lynch, a 9-year-old autistic girl missing from her Northern California home since Sunday, ended tragically on Wednesday with divers discovering her body

Clearlake Police Chief Craig Clausen 
said there was no indication of foul play, but offered few other 
details, the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa reported. It also wasn't immediately known how long she had been in the water for.

'It's difficult to be standing here saying this,' Clausen said at a news conference.

Her family told police that Mikaela was playing with her younger brother on a trampoline around 1pm when she abruptly took off on Sunday while leaving her clothes and shoes behind. Police were told she often removed her clothes when she was hot.

Mikaela's disappearance sparked a massive search effort that included hundreds of volunteers and law enforcement officials.

After the announcement of her death, volunteers and rescuers cried, the Press Democrat reported.

'We just wanted to find that baby and bring some peace to the family,' said Fred Cox of Clearlake, who was turned away from volunteering after Mikaela was found.

On Tuesday Clearlake Police Lt. Tim Celli spoke toÂ  ABC, explaining her ability to slip outside the family's property while momentarily left unattended.

Vanished: Mikaela's family say she was playing in this vacation home's enclosed backyard when she abruptly took off through an open gate left by her younger brother

Search: Authorities originally feared the girl had run off toward the water surrounding their home, seen circled in red, but thanks to a neighbor's surveillance video believe she ran from it

'She was an in enclosed yard, there was 
some sort of distraction, I believe a bee in the yard, the younger 
brother opened the gate, went inside, and when they came back, the 
daughter was missing,' said Celli.

Mikaela, originally from San Francisco, was described as 'severely autistic.' She was non-verbal and didn't respond to being called making search efforts monumentally challenging.

On Sunday a diaper the girl was believed to have been wearing was located near a waterway by K-9s at least one house away, Celli told the Santa Rosa Democrat. The find prompted additional fears of her drowning.

But on Monday a neighbor's video surveillance showed the girl running up the street and away from the waterway, turning the investigation away from the water - an area initially searched by divers.

Authorities say the girl's mother, Bari Lynch, who left in search of her daughter in her truck, unknowingly trailed her daughter's path down the same road only minutes later, but without success.

Authorities say they do not believe she was abducted.

Residents were asked to look high and low for the girl with her whereabouts believed to be anywhere.

'She's very inquisitive and she likes to explore, climb,' Haben Porter, a teacher at Sunset Elementary School who worked with Mikaela told ABC.
