Britain and the U.S. have joined forces to demand the United Nations take further action in Syria, as President Bashar Assad's brutal military crackdown shows no sign of stopping.

Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in a telephone call last night on the 'need for international unity' - as the city of Homs was bombarded by rockets and mortars for a eleventh consecutive day.

Today's attacks saw Assad's troops attacking rebels and homes on several fronts, with Homs succumbing to severe food and fuel shortages as residents remain trapped inside their homes.

The need, Cameron's spokesman said, included: 'Further action at the UN and a broad and strong coalition in the new Friends of Syria group.'

The two leaders, who are reluctant to get dragged in militarily, also 'discussed the possibility of increasing the pressure on the Assad regime through additional sanctions'.

The conversation came after the Arab League floated ideas to send in a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force.

That plan has been backed in part by the Obama administration, which feared it would be difficult to gain authorisation by the UN Security Council.

Chief among the hurdles is opposition by Russia and China, which vetoed a far less ambitious Security Council action already this month.

Russia has said peacekeepers could not be sent without Syrian government approval, and  officials in Damascus have already rejected the proposal, calling it unjustified interference in internal affairs.

'We support the Arab League's decisions ... to try to end the violence and move toward a transition,' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.

'There are a lot of challenges to be discussed as to how to put into effect all of their recommendations. And certainly, the peacekeeping request is one that will take agreement and consensus.

'So, we don't know that it is going to be possible to persuade Syria. They have already as of today rejected that, but I think this is what we are trying to explore,' she told reporters after meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu at the State Department.

At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration has begun discussions with the UN, the Arab League and allies about how an eventual peacekeeping force could work.

He said nothing about any U.S. participation, but it would be unlikely in the near term.

For now, talk of a peacekeeping force is preliminary, and largely theoretical. Carney said the discussion is about how peacekeepers 'could help to maintain peace in Syria, starting with there being a peace to keep'.

A February 24 meeting is scheduled in Tunisia of the Friends of Syria group that will plot efforts to compel Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime to end its brutal crackdown on opponents.

Ahead of that meeting, Clinton said the U.S., Turkey and other supporters of the Arab League plan would be discussing ways to support the opposition and expand the delivery of humanitarian supplies to those in need.

Among the topics of discussion will be intensifying sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Assad and his inner circle, greater outreach to regime opponents in and outside of the country and boosting financial contributions to organizations like the International Committee for the Red Cross and Red Crescent that are working in Syria.
