Petr Cech has insisted that the current crop of Chelsea stars are good enough to become the best side in the Blues' history, if they can ensure they win some silverware.

Chelsea have lost just one game in all competitions this season and sit top of the Premier League heading into the hectic festive schedule.

And victory over Derby County on Tuesday ensured they moved into the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, having already qualified top of their group in the Champions League.

Petr Cech believes Chelsea have the 'potential and quality' to be one of the best teams in Blues history

Jose Mourinho's squad is impressing Cech and he thinks they can make history this season. 

The Czech Republic international said: 'This team has the potential and the quality to be one of the best in Chelsea's history - if it can prove it by winning trophies.

'I like the way we approach games. We want to win every game. You cannot go and just say we leave this competition and chase another one because in that competition you pick you can have one unlucky game and you're out.

'That is why we try to win every game and progress in everything we have entered.'

Cech has found himself superseded as Chelsea's No 1 by Belgian stopper Courtois, but the 32-year-old  has returned to the team in recent weeks due to an injury to the former Atletico Madrid loanee.

Jose Mourinho's side have lost just one match all season and remain on the hunt for trophies on four fronts

There is still the possibility of a quadruple of trophies for the Blues this season - the Capital One Cup, the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League - and Cech is confident they can achieve success in at least one of them.

He continued: 'The aim is to win as many games and competitions as possible, but football is football - it's difficult to know how many of them you'll win.

'I think all the people that have come in this season have been doing remarkably well. Hopefully we all stay fit and the manager can use the whole squad because in this busy period you need everybody.'
