Denver Marchant was the police officer in charge of the crime scene in 1965 when a dead baby was found packed and posted to Darwin in the mail

Almost 50 years ago retired policeman Denver Marchant stood in a Darwin post office, investigating the shocking case of a dead newborn baby who had been posted in the mail.

The case was never solved, but it always stayed in the back of Mr Marchant's mind.

Last Friday, the 73-year-old who now lives in Queensland returned to Darwin for a rugby league reunion, and his partner Marilyn booked him into a hotel on Knuckey Street in the city centre.

He was shocked.

It was at the exact same address of the old post office, built on top of the crime scene of one of Darwin's most notorious cold cases.

The scene unfolded on May 3 in 1965, when postal worker John Polishuk noticed a foul smell coming from a package that had been sent from 'JF Barnes' in Mentone, Victoria.

He opened the uncollected package, sent to 'J Anderson', and was horrified to find a dead baby boy that still had part of his umbilical cord attached.

For Mr Marchant, returning to the same spot so many years later brought all his old frustrations back.

'I've witnessed hundreds of post mortems over the years,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'But for some reason that one stuck with me because it was so bizarre.

'I guess it shocked us and something like that I think is unparalleled in Australia.'

He has decided to speak out for only the second time since 1965 to reveal a new detail about the case, in the hope it will inspire someone to come forward with information that will solve it.

Mr Marchant said the baby boy was found with a stocking wrapped tightly around his neck, ruling out the possibility that he was stillborn.

'It was as tight as you could get it, it took a long time to get it off,' Mr Marchant said.

'For that child to have been murdered it must have taken a breath.

'There was no reason to put that stocking around the child's neck if it was stillborn.'

Mr Marchant also still has photos of the badly decomposed body, but he says they are too gruesome to make public.

He remembers the day he got the call to attend an incident at the post office just 200m away from the police station in central Darwin.

'You just take your camera and walk down, you have no idea what you're going to find,' he said.

'When I got there the post office staff had already opened it up but not fully up, it was only partly opened.

'The first thing we did was put it in a plastic bag and send it straight to the morgue.'

A couple of days later the post mortem was carried out, and Mr Marchant watched on but he suspected the doctor performing it was inexperienced.

'I got a feeling that the doctor had not done many post mortems,' he said.

'That's not decrying what the gentleman did, he did his best.

'It's probably a fair comment to say the doctor was very distressed - he was not a young man and my bet was he had kids as well.'

The case was eventually passed onto Victorian police, because the crime was committed there and not in Darwin.

Mr Marchant said many people had come up with theories over the years, but he thinks it was most likely a crime committed by a mother with post-natal depression.

He remained a superintendent in Darwin until 1995 when he retired, and spent some years as an advisor to the rural Papua New Guinean police before eventually settling in Hervey Bay in Queensland.

Mr Marchant said times had changed since he was a police officer and he was aware that the public now is able to play a more active role in solving crime.

'At one stage policing was a closed shop and you didn't tell anyone anything,' he said.

'But with social media out there and all sorts of things you never know, it might jog someone's memory.

'You might have someone make a confession on their death bed – it's not likely but it can happen.'

Mr Marchant is cautiously optimistic the case might get solved after all these years.

'You've got to remain positive with these things, you can't just say nothing will ever happen,' he said.

'I guess it's probably the copper in me but you really do like to see something happen.

'It's a matter of personal satisfaction.'
