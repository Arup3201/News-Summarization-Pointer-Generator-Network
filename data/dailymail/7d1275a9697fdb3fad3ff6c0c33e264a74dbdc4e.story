Police are searching for two teenage girls who went missing
from the same area on the same day in apparently unlinked disappearances.

Concern is rising for the welfare of Shannon Bladen and
Jessica Brant, who have both been missing from the Alway area of Newport, South
Wales, since last Wednesday.

Gwent Police acknowledge that officers have no evidence to
suggest the disappearances are linked, but the possibility has not been ruled
out.

Missing: Jessica Brant, 13, of Alway, Newport, south Wales, (left) was last seen on Wednesday afternoon and Shannon Bladen, 14, of Alway, Newport, south Wales, (right) was last seen on Wednesday morning

'We have no information to suggest they are linked in
any way but it has not been ruled out as a possibility,' a spokeswoman
said.

'Obviously they have been missing for some days now and
concern is rising for their welfare.'

Shannon, 14, was last seen at 7.55am on Wednesday when she
left home to catch a bus to school. She is described as 5ft 1in and of slim
build with dyed black shoulder-length hair.

She was wearing the Newport High School uniform of black
trousers and black polo top with yellow shoulders, and a grey hooded jumper
with a denim jacket over it. She was carrying a red and white Betty Boo bag
containing a blue hooded jumper.

Jessica, 13, went missing at around 3.30pm the same day. She
is 5ft 3in and of medium build, with dyed black shoulder-length hair which, when
she was last seen, was tied in a ponytail.

When she disappeared she was wearing leggings and a khaki
green jacket with what has been described as a lumberjack pattern on the arms.

Officers want anyone with any information about the
whereabouts of either girl to call Gwent Police on 101.
