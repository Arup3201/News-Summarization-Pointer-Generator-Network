It was the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle and a home to raise their young son that led Ray and Marie Butler from London to Scotland at the turn of the millennium. 

And when they set eyes on Penninghame House – with its sweeping tree-lined approach, castle-like entrance and magnificent halls – they knew immediately they’d found the perfect place for them.

The house is set in 100 acres of deer, fox and pheasant-laden woods near the town of Newton Stewart – and has access to an abundance of sea trout and salmon in the River Cree. 

Captivating gome: Ray and Marie Butler transformed former prison Penninghame House near Newton Stewart in Scotland into a £2.62million pound estate with 13 bedrooms and five cottages

But the tranquil estate also has an intriguing past: one of its former uses was as an open prison.

In the early 1950s the Prison Service bought Penninghame. It could hold 85 prisoners and many of them would work on the estate and in its garden centre, which was open to the public and sold local produce. Some of the inmates, who were considered no danger to the public, travelled outside for work as part of their rehabilitation.

But by the late 1990s the prison was operating well below capacity, and it closed due to budget cuts in 2000. When the Butlers took it over, they turned much of the estate into a different kind of rehabilitation centre – a retreat offering a variety of courses to improve people’s emotional and physical health.

Entrepreneur Ray, who started his own building company when he was just 18, previously ran two restaurants and an alternative health clinic in London. As well as the health retreat and a cooking school, Ray and Marie have turned Penninghame House into a sumptuous family home. Away from the main house, the property also includes cottages and stables and there is planning permission for a pool and leisure complex.

Penninghame’s history goes right to the heart of Scotland’s heraldic ancestry. The land ownership can be traced back to the monarchic Stewart dynasty, through the tumultuous period of Mary, Queen of Scots and the reign of Queen Anne, and into the industrial age and beyond.

The striking Victorian facade, built in 1869, melds into a property dating from the early 17th Century which was once owned by the Earl of Galloway’s family. The last Earl to own the estate was John Stewart, the 7th Earl of Galloway, who was a Lord of the Bedchamber to King George III.

In 1825 it was bought by Conservative MP James Blair, who made his fortune from plantations in the West Indies. At its largest, the Penninghame Estate comprised 37,000 acres, with 40 farms and 30 full-time staff.

The house, which is 46 miles from Dumfries and 76 from Glasgow, was used as a hospital during the First World War, after which it returned to use as a private home. In the early 1920s, when it was the home of mill owner Henry Oxley, the estate was recorded as covering 18,000 acres.

Ray’s knowledge of the history of the building was added to by a real-life account of the Oxley era, after an elderly former servant asked to visit.

 Ray says: ‘The lady worked as a housemaid and remembered fondly the large parties and dinners during that period, and that Oxley dressed formally each evening and ate in the large dining room.’

The renovation work was a labour of love. Ray says: ‘The oak staircase and all of the imported pitch pine floors were stripped back and oiled. Each of the 88 windows was given individual attention. 

'We invested in a new heating system and did major work on the electrics and even added a gym studio.’

The house now has grandiose formal rooms adorned with a spectacular array of fine art, collectable antiques and wood-burning fireplaces. 

The couple also installed a contemporary kitchen and living area they call Little Sweden, which is inspired by Marie’s roots. And they obviously run deep: the couple are selling because they are moving to Sweden to be closer to her family.

‘The house has served us well,’ says Ray. ‘When we came to Penninghame we were given a very good welcome to the area by the neighbours and people in the community.’

He does not fish, shoot or hunt; however, he says Penninghame is perfect for those with a passion for the great outdoors. Another draw is Penninghame’s proximity to some of the world’s best golf courses, such as Turnberry and Royal Troon.

At the front of the property there is a helipad that doubles as a bowling green – and Ray says: ‘We’ve had friends who’ve flown to London by helicopter.’

As well as 13 bedrooms, the house comes with ten bathrooms and five reception rooms. The official valuation of the property – which Scottish law insists upon – has set the minimum price for offers for the house alone at £1.5 million. Five other properties on the estate are for sale, with minimum prices ranging from £220,000 to £350,000. For the whole estate, offers over £2.62 million will be considered.
