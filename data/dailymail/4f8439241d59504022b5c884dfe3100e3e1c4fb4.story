United States-based airlines reported 17 animal fatalities and 26 injuries in 2014.

Of all the carriers, United Airlines reported the most deaths and injuries, while SkyWest boasted a record zero animal fatalities.

The data was released by the Department of Transportation, as part of a larger compilation of operating information, in its Consumer Air Travel Report.

In 2014, 17 animal fatalities and 26 pet injuries were reported by several U.S. airlines

Most of the injuries reported involved dogs and cats that had been hurt as they attempted to escape from their cages.

Alaska - 3 deaths

American - 3 deaths

Delta - 4 deaths

Hawaiian - 2 deaths

SkyWest - 0 deaths

United - 5 deaths

Many of the deaths were a result of the animals actually escaping from their transport cages and being hit by other vehicles at the airport.

Another major cause of death was underlying health conditions, such as dogs with short or snub noses, which were then aggravated by the stress of travelling. 

Several airlines are currently reviewing their policies for those types of animals, such as pugs and English bulldogs.

These brachycephalic breeds, more frequently than others, experience breathing problems when faced with stressful conditions.

Thus, they have a particularly high risk of suffocating in-flight.

Whenever possible, it is advised to purchase your pet a spot in the passenger cabin instead of cargo hold

Despite friendly staff and smooth air, animals travelling in the cargo hold of a commercial jet do face their fair share of environmental stresses, such as varying temperatures, loud noises and air pressure drops. 

However, since two million animals travel on commercial flights each year, the number of those injured, lost or killed is still extremely low.

And the total number of animal deaths seems to be declining.

In 2011, 35 pets died while travelling on U.S. airlines and in 2012, 29 pets died. 

Between 2010 and 2013, it was Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths.

However, Delta maintains that the reason for their higher numbers is simply because they carry more pets than any other competing airline. 

Delta is also very open about the lengthy precautions that taken to ensure animal safety on board, which includes not allowing pets to travel between May 15 and September 15 when temperatures my get too hot.

They also reserve the right not to carry pets in the cargo hold during periods of extreme cold weather. 

Good news, since nearly all animal incidents reported to the Department of Transportation involve pets in the cargo hold.
