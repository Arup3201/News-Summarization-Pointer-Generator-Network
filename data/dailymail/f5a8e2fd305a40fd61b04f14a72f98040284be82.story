Chelsea midfielder Willian says he is aiming  to win every single trophy on offer to the club this season.

The 26-year-old Brazilian ended his first season at the club last campaign without silverware, and told chelseafc.com that he is hoping to make amends this time round.

Jose Mourinho's side currently sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League table, as well as being top of their Champions League group and into the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup. 

Willian is targeting the 'quadruple' for Chelsea this season after last season's trophyless campaign

‘The aim is to reach the summer and be able to celebrate the Quadruple: the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup,’ Willian told their official website.

‘Why should we aim for any less? It's a dream and we all know it won't be easy. In fact, we know it will be a lot of hard work, but that is what we are here for.’

Chelsea overcame Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night, and are set to face Championship side Derby County in the last-eight in December.

And Willian is hoping that the Blues can continue to progress in the competition, as he would love the opportunity to play at Wembley.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will be hoping that his side can maintain their unbeaten start against QPR

‘I've never had the pleasure of playing there,' he added. 'I've been before when I went to see Brazil against England, and it was fantastic. It just made me even more determined to play there myself, and I hope that will be with Chelsea.’

Chelsea are going into their 10th Premier League game of the campaign against QPR on Saturday in the hopes of maintaining their unbeaten start to the season. 

And despite his side being heavy favourites for victory, Willian maintains there is no such thing as an easy game in the Premier League.

‘Every match is so, so difficult and, even when you play a team which is near the bottom of the league, you know to expect a tough game. But the mentality always has to be the same – we have to win.’
