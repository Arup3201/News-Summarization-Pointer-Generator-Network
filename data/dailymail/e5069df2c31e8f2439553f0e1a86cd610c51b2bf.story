Energy  giant Npower faces a multi-million-pound fine and a ban on telesales activity over a bills shambles that has hit 280,000 customers.

Industry regulator Ofgem has given it an ultimatum to improve customer service and deliver accurate bills by August or face a fine that could top £10million.

The ruling is a victory for the Daily Mail’s MoneyMail section, which triggered the investigation last year by submitting a dossier highlighting the shambles to the watchdog.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it was 'unacceptable that so many Npower customers have not received the customer service they deserve'

It contained dozens of letters and 
emails from people who suffered poor service, wildly inaccurate bills 
and frustrating delays in getting refunds.

Npower received almost 1.4million 
complaints in 2013 – and the number in the first three months of 2014 
was up 70 per cent on a year ago.

Hundreds of thousands of customers 
were not sent bills for months, sometimes more than a year, despite 
making repeated requests to know how much they owed. The result was that
 they then faced huge bills – of more than £1,000 in some cases – 
followed by demands to pay up or face some kind of enforcement action.

There were also serious problems with
 incorrect direct debit payments. Some customers are owed hundreds of 
pounds by Npower as result of over-payments, but have had difficulties 
getting their money back.

Npower admitted in September that a 
computer glitch caused by a transfer to a new billing system had caused 
problems with 700,000 customer accounts. In December, it apologised and 
agreed to make a payment of £1million to vulnerable customers by way of 
redress.

However the company still has a huge 
backlog of more than 400,000 bills to sort out and has been given an 
ultimatum by Ofgem to reduce that figure to 100,000 by the end of August
 or face a telesales ban.

Big six energy supplier must cut the number of accounts in its late billing backlog from around 400,000 today to 100,000 over the next three months

The watchdog also announced an 
investigation into poor customer service associated with the way it 
handled complaints that could lead to a huge fine.Sarah Harrison, 
Ofgem’s senior partner in charge of enforcement, said Npower customers 
had suffered ‘service failures’ for too long.

‘We have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings,’ she said.

MoneyMail has been inundated with complaints from Npower customers.

After a series of reports detailing wildly incorrect billing, delays getting refunds and poor customer service, we handed Ofgem a dossier of customer complaints last July.

Chris Stacey and Natalie Kew from South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, were among the angry users after moving to Npower.

The switch took five months to sort out, then the couple were not billed for nine months and were also locked out of their online account.

After MoneyMail intervened Npower sorted out the issue and paid £400 in compensation. Mr Stacey said the firm was ‘incompetent from day one’.

‘Npower’s recovery plan has not 
delivered as far and fast as is necessary. Our analysis of complaints 
data also raises some serious concerns which will be thoroughly examined
 in our investigation.’

Thousands of people have contacted 
Citizens’ Advice for help in dealing with Npower. Its chief executive, 
Gillian Guy, said: ‘Exposing customers to bill shock is completely 
unacceptable. Providing accurate bills and dealing with problems quickly
 are the basics of decent customer service. Npower is a long way from 
providing that.’

Energy Secretary Ed Davey joined the attack, describing Npower’s customer service as ‘unacceptable’.

Npower is a subsidiary of the giant 
German utility firm RWE, which has a history of failing British 
consumers. When it owned Thames Water it was fined £9.7million for 
failures in 2005 and 2006.

It has also been criticised over its 
tax affairs. The firm made £750million profit in the three years 2009 to
 2011 but paid no corporation tax.

Npower’s UK chief executive, Paul 
Massara, wrote to all 3.4million customers in December apologising but 
the company was forced to issue a second apology yesterday.

It said it has assigned an extra 650
 staff to help resolve customer service problems and it is spending 
£20million to improve its systems.

Mr Massara said Npower was ‘committed
 to getting things right for our customers’ and promised that none would
 be left out of pocket.

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd
 consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving 
deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest 
deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

If
 you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. 
stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big 
chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Prices
 are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff
 that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
