Throwing a New Year's Even party? All you need to  look great and guarantee the bash is a hit are some sequins, a spa session and plenty of champagne, according to TOWIE star Amy Childs.

The beautician from Brentwood, Essex,  shared her advice for throwing a glitzy event with FEMAIL as she prepared to host her family for Christmas Day for the first time.

Amy, 24, said: 'Glam yourself up, do something special and treat yourself to something like a blow-dry or a massage. The hostess needs looking after too.'

The entrepreneur, who has two businesses in Essex, is planning to take the reins this party season by hosting the festivities at her new home.

She was at Clothes Show Live in London and Birmingham earlier this month promoting her popular fashion line. 

'I am so looking forward to spending Christmas at home with my family,' she said.

'I'm hosting it this year so it'll be the first time at my new house. I'm really nervous about the cooking - the most I ever cook is fajitas.'

Fortunately her mother and cousin Harry Derbridge will be on hand.  

'My mum will be helping me out though so it'll be alright and Harry's great at being my sous chef. 

'l'll have to make an effort though and get dressed up - last year I was in my onesie all day. We will play games and have a really great day. I can't wait.'

Amy started her range in 2011 with a line of dresses and now she presents a party dress capsule collection

Amy's top tip for New Year's Eve parties is 'dress to impress'. 'I always say the secret to looking great is feeling great,' she says. 'You can't beat a bit of confidence.'

But she says you should still go for something bold and different as the festive season is the perfect time to do it.

'I love New Years and Christmas as it's the only time you can really go all out with the glitz and glam.

Reality star Amy said: 'The best tip for throwing a party is to look the part. Glam yourself up.'

Amy's clothing line includes form-fitting sequinned cocktail dresses and strappy numbers with lace detail 

'That's why I've brought out some long gowns and some sequin numbers, they are perfect for that special night. 

'You will not go unnoticed rocking one of them that's for sure. 

'People always ask me if they would look good in one of my sequin dresses and I always tell them to try it and they always love it on them. 

'It's good to get out of your comfort zone sometimes with fashion. Also, it means you don't have to worry about accessorising then.' 

Amy said the key to enjoying any New Year's Eve celebration is to equip yourself with a bottle of Champagne and start the party as early as possible.

Amy has expanded the size range of her designs to an 18 because she says curvy girls love her collections

'I think the best tip for throwing a party is to look the part. Glam yourself up, do something special and treat yourself to something like a blow-dry or a massage. The hostess needs looking after too.

'Then make sure you have plenty of bubbly, snacks and friends. I love having some glam time with the girls. It's so nice to get everyone together and have a great time.'

And she's planning to be the perfect hostess this party season by throwing not only a Christmas get-together but a New Year's party, too.

She said: 'I'm actually going to host my first murder mystery night before New Year's. I'm really excited I've always wanted to do one.'
