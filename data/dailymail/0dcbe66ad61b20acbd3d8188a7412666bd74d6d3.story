The Centre for Social Justice has called for US-style jail terms for criminals who break the terms of their court order

More than 27,000 criminals were given a community sentence last year despite having at least 15 crimes to their name.

The use of such punishments - which criminals regard as a ‘laughing stock’ because they are so soft - has shot up by 75 per cent in a decade, a report reveals today.

The damning report by the Centre for Social Justice published today finds community sentences ‘lack credibility’ and are held in utter contempt by the criminal class.

It calls for US-style instant punishment of up to a week behind bars for anyone who breaks the terms of their court order.

The ‘short sharp shock’ of up to seven days in jail would act as a major deterrent and restore faith in community sentences, it says.

In US states which have introduced swift jail sentences, the level of reoffending by those on community sentences has plummeted.

The idea is likely to be given serious consideration by senior Conservatives as they draw up plans for the next Tory manifesto.

The report lays bare the staggering failure of community sentences to turn offenders away from crime.

And it shows how repeat criminals who have offended time and time again are nevertheless allowed to walk free from court with a non-custodial sentence.

The report, based on official Ministry of Justice figures, shows the startling rise in community sentences given out to repeat criminals.

Despite having at least 15 previous crimes under their belts, some 27,632 criminals were given a community sentence in 2012/13.

That represents a rise of 76 per cent from the level in 2003/4 of 15,709.

Every year, criminals on community sentences commit more than 160,000 offences - or more than 435 every single day.

The researchers found among the criminals most likely to breach their community orders were those required to undergo drug rehabilitation.

Lax rules allow them to ‘game’ the system because drug test appointments are scheduled, rather than random.

This allows heroin users to stop taking drugs for a few days beforehand, knowing they will be out of their system by the time of the test.

Even those who fail drug tests are rarely hauled back to court. The researchers found one criminal who failed half his tests over a six month period and faced no further sanction because he was not reported by his probation officer.

Edward Boyd, editor of the ‘Sentences in the Community’ report said: ‘Many prolific offenders are refusing to take their punishment and rehabilitation seriously and are getting away with it.’

‘What we have found in the US is that the consequences of a day or two in prison shows offenders that they have to comply and means they take more responsibility.’

‘This approach is slashing reoffending rates as offenders realise they can’t get away with breaking the rules. This new idea offers the government an opportunity to restore faith in community punishments’.

The report also revealed that it can take up to five months for an offender to start their community sentence from when they walk out of court.

Such ‘punishments’ can include clearing litter, painting walls or doing other unpaid work in the community.

A programme of immediate prison sentences of a few days is in use in around 20 states across the US.

In Texas, a programme of short prison terms for criminals found more than nine in ten finished their community sentences, and only a handful broke the rules.

Currently, in the UK, around a third of offenders given community sentences reoffend within a year of being sentenced. And thousands more may commit crimes which they are never caught for.

Community sentences are also used repeatedly, despite criminals’ flagrant reoffending. In 2012, 25 per cent of those given a custodial sentence already had at least five previous community terms - or 37,019 individuals.

Justice minister Jeremy Wright said ministers were
'determined' to tackle high reoffending rates.

'This report raises some important issues and highlights the
very clear fact that offending rates are unacceptably high,' he said.

'Tough conditions are available to the judiciary when they
impose community sentences. To further toughen community sentences, we are
making changes that will mean they will have to contain an element of
punishment, such as a curfew or community service, when imposed on adult
offenders.

'Anyone who refuses to complete their community sentence can
expect to be hauled back in front of a judge and face further punishment.'
