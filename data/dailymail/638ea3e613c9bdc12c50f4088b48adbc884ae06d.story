Cash bribes to hospitals to put patients on to the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway will be ended, families have been told.

The disclosure means that the NHS payments – which amount to at least £30million – are likely to be stopped later this year.

A Health Department inquiry is underway into the Pathway, which was originally developed to ease the last days and hours of dying patients.

Progress: Fiona Bruce MP, left, saved her father from the pathway which Care Minister Norman Lamb, right, said he acknowledged 'terrified' some people

Care Minister Norman Lamb spoke to families of Pathway patients in Leeds in the first of a series of meetings designed to feed their views into the inquiry, which was launched in February and will report in the summer.

One family at the meeting said that their 82-year old grandmother died over a period of 12 days after fluids and food were withdrawn.  They said that their grandmother, who had early stage cervical cancer, was eating and drinking before being put on the Pathway.

How the Mail has reported on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway

One family member said that Mr Lamb acknowledged that people were ‘terrified’ of the Liverpool Care Pathway.

She
added: ‘He is appalled that people feared they were not getting cared 
for but put to death in hospital. He said he would definitely be looking
to stop any form of financial payment to hospitals to put patients on 
the Liverpool Care Pathway.

‘He said that most definitely he didn’t believe that hospitals should be gaining from patients dying on the LCP.’

Payments to hospitals to hit targets were first revealed by the Daily Mail last autumn.

Some have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year for reaching targets for LCP deaths.

For
example, the hospital trust in Blackpool was last year paid £450,000 in
return for ensuring 35 per cent of patients who die in hospital are on
the LCP. Families have protested that relatives who were not dying have
been placed on the Pathway.

Tory MP Fiona Bruce has told how she saved her father’s life when she pulled him off the Pathway.

She
had already seen her mother die an ‘agonising’ death when she was put 
on an end-of-life pathway after brain surgery two years earlier.

Miss Bruce said her 83-year-old father
was admitted to a hospital, which she did not name, suffering from an 
unidentified illness that left him ‘weak and frail’.

After
a few days, a nurse had ‘almost casually’ told her: ‘He has not long to
live. We are putting him on the Liverpool Care Pathway.’

Miss Bruce told a meeting in Parliament there had been ‘no  discussion, no explanation, no consultation’ between the family and the hospital staff.

She said that her mother’s ‘heart-rending’ death after being deprived of food and fluids – without her family being consulted – had left her with a sense of ‘terrible guilt’.

The Congleton MP contacted her sister and they insisted their father was removed from the Pathway. He was placed in a nursing home. ‘Now, well over six months later that elderly man is very much alive, eating well, getting up when he wants and resting when he doesn’t, enjoying visits from his family,’ she said. ‘He is looking forward to his 85th birthday.’

An end to payments for Pathway targets would free hospitals from the suspicion of taking money in return for the deaths of patients.

Analysts believe the inquiry will also recommend that no patient should be put on the Pathway without either their own consent or that of their closest family.

Another likelihood is a change of name so the tainted title of Liverpool Care Pathway is no longer used.

Mr Lamb said: ‘It is important that I respect the independence of this review but I have already made clear that I have serious concerns about the use of financial incentives and that they should only ever be used if they demonstrably improve patient care.’
