They are the signature style of superheroes but now they are hitting the mainstream -  that's right brace yourself, this summer sees the return of the catsuit.

Glastonbury is well known for sparking a summer trend, just take a look at how well the floral headband took off, but could the latest surge in the famously unflattering skin tight all-in-ones be the craziest yet?

Rita Ora and Mary Charteris are well known for their controversial fashion choices but even the slightly tamer dressed, such as Sienna Miller were spotted trussed up in these brightly coloured,  tight numbers.

How do you go to the toilet? Rita was spotted in one of Ekaterina Malysheva's bold catsuits at this year's Glastonbury

The signature printed Katsuits and bodies are designed by Ekaterina Malysheva who was inspired by her visit to Nevada's Burning Man Festival and wanted to start a fashion movement with her bold stand-out pieces.

Despite many of us being a tad scared of skin-tight lycra the russian born designer has enjoyed great success and is predicted to continue selling well over the summer.

Ekaterina told the Telegraph that despite her celebrity success she was still aiming higher with Madonna, Lady Gaga and Rhianna being her dream celebrities to dress.

Festival fever: Actress Jamie Winstone paired her Katsuit with a metallic shirt and fringed jacket

It's true that festival fashion has become less about utility and more about trends with wellies taking a backseat what with Rita Ora's white fringed boots and Caroline Flack's red suede shoes being anything but sensible footwear for a mud bath.

But there is still something about an all-in-one skin-tight jumpsuit and a muddy festival that doesn't quite marry. However Ekaterina insists that her designs are more than just a fashion statement.

She told the Telegraph: 'You need to wear something very, very simple (at a festival) and something you can easily move around in.

'Our silhouettes are easy to take on and off, are sexy because they are body hugging and backless and have a very funky print. As we know Glastonbury is pretty messy, rain and mud are easily washed off.'

Catsuits weren't the only unlikely trend to to make a return at Glastonbury. This year's festival saw the rebound of portable music as an accessory and we aren't talking about iPods!

Remember the whacky eighties trend of lugging a boombox around on your shoulders? Well the new take is the same idea but with less shoulder cramp.

Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Laura Whitmore were all spotted wearing Beats Pill XL at this year's Glastonbury.

Rita refused to be parted with hers on day one of the festival and reportedly made her crew join her in a group sing-along to Blondie's Hanging on the Telephone.

Nick Grimshaw created his own on-the-go party by stealing Rita's Pill to blair music from the VIP bar with pals including Sam Smith, Alexa Chung, Florence Welch and 
Lily Allen.

His playlist also included some 80s diamonds such as Prince's Controversy, we predict it's only a matter of time until Grimmy is spotted in rollerblades and leg warmers.

The brightly coloured straps for the speakers came from a recent fashion collaboration between Dr Dre and iconic British fashion designer Henry Holland to create a summer accessory for the Beats Pill XL.

To pimp up your Pill 80s style and in designer fashion you'll need to be happy to pay high-end prices with the straps coming in at £199.

If you want to make your Pill portable you better be prepared to pay the premium price of £199
