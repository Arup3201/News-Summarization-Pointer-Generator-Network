Years of racing around kitchens and slaving over a hot stove have left Heston Blumenthal needing a hip replacement at the age of 47.

The celebrity chef is known for ‘molecular’ dishes like snail porridge, meat fruit and bacon and egg ice cream – but he has had his fair share of health problems.

Now doctors have told him that a combination of gruelling 120-hour weeks and his dedication to fitness – he is a karate black belt – have taken a toll on his body.

Steaming ahead: Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, pictured out with his girlfriend Suzanne Pirret, is forced to have a hip replacement at the tender age of 47

He said: ‘My surgeon looked at my X-rays and said all he could see was just bone on bone – there was no fluid at all.

'He told me that if I wanted to keep doing my job there was no choice – I had to have the op.

'It’s quite uncomfortable. It has its moments when it gets worse than others.’

However, the Michelin-starred chef refuses to let the pain get in the way of his daily work-out.

‘I am still exercising. I’d rather put up with the discomfort than stop the exercise.

Not so hip: Heston said doctor's told him he had no choice but to have a hip replacement if he wanted to keep cooking

'I can’t play racket ball, which I used to do every morning, but I can do the exercise bike and the cross trainer.

‘I broke my shoulder last year, but now it’s fixed I’ve started doing weights again. I do that about 8-10 hours a week, sometimes twice a day.’

And with two restaurants to run, endless TV commitments, contracts with Waitrose and Channel 4 and a new glossy coffee table book – Historic Heston Blumenthal  –  out in October, his main problem is finding time for the operation.

He explained: ‘I want to put it off as long as possible. Partly because there’s no guarantee how long the new hip will last.’

He is no stranger to  dramas having endured a five-hour operation to have two titanium rods  inserted at the base of his spine to counteract chronic back pain.

Blumenthal is also accident-prone. He nearly lost the sight in his right eye during a play fight with ex-Arsenal player Lee Dixon.

‘I rammed a loo roll in his mouth and he retaliated by sticking the toilet brush in my face.

'Unfortunately it still had bleach on which is why I can’t wear contact lenses.’

Four years ago he broke a bone in his hand playing cricket  and at the age of nine, he broke his leg falling off a roof.

Blumenthal said: ‘My hip problem is a combination of martial arts, a stretched leg which put my hips out of alignment and my back.

'I’m gradually being rebuilt. It’s funny because I’m feeling pretty good... but it won’t last.’
