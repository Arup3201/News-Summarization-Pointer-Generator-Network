Murder-suicide: The bodies of David Crowley, his dietitian wife Komel and their child were discovered by a neighbor in Apple Valley, Minnesota, on Sunday morning

He went to the steps of their house to pick up packages that had been there for days. A dog was said to be inside at the time.

Several neighbors said Crowley may have been veteran and had tattoos on his arm. The family are believed to have lived in the house for around a year-and-a-half.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Dakota County Sheriff's Office are assisting the Apple Valley Police Department with the investigation.

They confirmed they are treating the death as 'suspicious'.  

Alice Hixson and her husband, Bill, have lived across the street for 21 years. Mrs Hixon told the paper: 'It's such a grisly, gruesome thing.'

They had seen Crowley in the yard playing with the child and would often pass them in the street.  

On his Intsagram, Crowley posted pictures of himself holding weapons and wearing hunting attire. 

He was also filmed in a video for the Bullet Exchange, a supplier of military and police film props.  

According to Mrs Crowley's career profile, she is a self-employed Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) with six years experience in counseling, medical nutrition therapy, eating psychology, and functional medicine.

She also ran a consulting firm known as MindBody Dietitians. 

Couple: Neighbors said the pair had lived in the neighborhood for just over a year-and-a half 

Deceased: The pair had not been since before Christmas. It is not known how long their bodies were there for 

Weapons: A picture posted on Crowley's Instagram shows him wearing a gas mask and a huge rifle 

Career: He appeared in a video for The Bullet Exchange - a Minnesota company that provides military and police props to filmmakers 

Discovery: A neighbor saw the bodies when he went to pick up packages at the front door of their home that had been left there for days
