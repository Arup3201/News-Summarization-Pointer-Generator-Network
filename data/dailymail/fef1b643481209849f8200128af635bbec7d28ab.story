Increased media exposure has led to a collapse in the personal ratings of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, new analysis reveals.

Despite the UK Independence Party winning scores of council seats and boasting of victory in next year’s European elections, the public appears to have fallen out of love with the party’s smoking, drinking figurehead.

From a peak net satisfaction rating of +11 per cent in May, he slumped to -13 per cent in November, with almost half saying he is ‘more style than substance’.

Dissatisfaction: Net public approval ratings for Mr Farage have collapsed during 2013

Personality: Nigel Farage has proven popular with voters, but their fear he would not be good in a crisis

UKIP has enjoyed an extraordinary year, cementing a lead in the polls over the Liberal Democrats and forcing the Tories to set out a tougher stance on Europe.

While the Conservatives fear they could lose MPs if voters switching to UKIP allow Labour to win, Mr Farage insists he is taking support from all the main parties.

UKIP is expected to capitalise on the lifting of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians from January by arguing that only by leaving the EU can Britain take back control of its borders.

Mr Farage has boasted that he will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ by topping the polls in May’s elections to the European Parliament.

But analysis of Ipsos MORI opinion polls throughout 2013 shows how public satisfaction with the UKIP leader has tumbled as voters get to see him more.

In May 40 per cent of those questioned said they were ‘satisfied’ with Mr Farage as leader, while only 26 per cent were dissatisfied.

Views: Voters were asked what they thought of Mr Farage, and almost half thought he was 'more style than substance'

By November the figures had reversed, with only 28 per cent satisfied to 41 per cent satisfied.

In December the figures improved slightly, with satisfied at 33 per cent and dissatisfied 38 per cent.

Pollsters warn UKIP’s appeal as the ‘none of the above’ party for those disaffected with the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems will be eroded as their profile rises.

Voters who learn more about Mr Farage have grown more dissastifed.

Tom Mludzinski, deputy head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘As with most political leaders, it’s a case of the more they get to know someone the less they like them.

'Mr Farage’s personal approval ratings have become increasingly negative over the course of the year as more people see him and get to know him. Perhaps he is appearing more like any other politician.

‘The one thing UKIP are seen as is different from everyone but that’s going to be difficult to keep up if they do start winning and doing well.’

Mr Farage remains a ‘big factor’ for the party’s appeal, with 9 out of 10 UKIP supporters saying they are satisfied with him.

Popular: During 2013 UKIP has cemented its lead in the polls over the Liberal Democrats, ending the year on 10 per cent

Mr Mludzinski said: ‘UKIP supporters are generally dissatisfied with everyone, whatever questions we ask, they tend to be more negative about everything.

‘It might be this is mid-term blues and people who are fed-up with the status quo don’t have anyone to turn to but UKIP.

‘The public know very little about UKIP and their policies at the moment and so can use them as a blank canvas. People don’t know anything about them. They don’t know what policies they have or what they stand for really. At the moment they can use them as a blank canvas.’

Half of voters say Mr Farage has ‘lots of personality’ but they also say he is ‘more style than substance’.

Just over a third (36 per cent) say he is out of touch with ordinary people and only 19 per cent think he has ‘sound judgement’ and 16 per cent think he would be ‘good in a crisis’.
