NBA legend Michael Jordan, perhaps the most celebrated player in the history of professional basketball, said he's both disgusted and outraged by the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.

Jordan, now the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, released a statement Sunday addressing the matter, in which he says that, as an owner, 'I'm completely disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views.'

As a former player, Jordan says 'I'm completely outraged.'

Air Jordan: Michael Jordan, the NBA's most celebrated athlete, weighed in on Clippers owner Donald Sterling's alleged racist tirades

An audio recording obtained by TMZ alleges that Sterling made racist comments to a girlfriend, including urging her not to bring black friends to Clippers games.

The NBA and the Clippers are investigating, including whether the male voice on the recording is in fact Sterling's.

Jordan said he is confident that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will investigate the matter fully and 'take appropriate action quickly.'

'There is no room in the NBA - or anywhere else - for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed,' Jordan said. 'I am appalled that this type of ignorance still exists within our country and at the highest levels of our sport. In a league where the majority of players are African-American, we cannot and must not tolerate discrimination at any level.'

Jordan is just the latest in a long line of athletes, celebrities and other influential people to express their disgust over Sterling's alleged racist comments. 

President Barack Obama even took time out of his trip to Malaysia to address Sterling's alleged comments.

At a press conference with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak Sunday, Obama was asked about Sterling's alleged comments.

'When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk. That's what happened here,' the President said.

Obama also said Sterling's alleged comments are an example of how 'the United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation.'

'That's still there, the vestiges of discrimination. We've made enormous strides, but you're going to continue to see this percolate up every so often,' Obama said in Malaysia.

The details of how the audio recordings made their way to TMZ are only starting to be revealed. V. Stiviano, the woman heard in the recordings, was recently sued by the Sterling family for embezzlement.

She is a 'defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'

Clippers president Andy Roeser said in a Saturday statement on behalf of Sterling that served as the first official response to the recordings.

Sterling was supposed to receive a lifetime achievement award in the coming week from the NAACP.

However, NAACP interim President Lorraine C. Miller told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that Sterling was no longer getting the award.

The league said Saturday it was investigating the recording posted on TMZ's website, calling the remarks made by Sterling to his girlfriend ‘disturbing and offensive.’
