Militant union chiefs were humiliated yesterday as they called off strike plans after admitting their threat to the start of the Olympics had prompted ‘abuse and vitriol’.

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, insisted he had ‘no regrets’ about plotting the strike, which had been planned to cause chaos on Britain’s borders today.

The climbdown came hours after ministers revealed that more than enough border staff had volunteered to work to ensure Heathrow, which is expecting its busiest ever day as thousands arrive for the Games, operated as normal.

Other union leaders and Labour leader 
Ed Miliband were also understood to have been dismayed that the PCS had 
so badly misjudged the public mood by seeking to disrupt the Olympics.

Mr Serwotka sought to save face by 
claiming the Home Office had agreed to create an extra 1,100 jobs, 800 
at the UK Border Force and 300 at the Passport Office.

But ministers said no posts were being
 created in response to his strike threat, and they had been planned for
 some time to plug vacancies.

It also emerged that only 400 are being 
recruited at the Border Force.

The 800 figure came about because of an 
administrative error in two job adverts.

Deal: PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka claims the deal shows the Government admits to making too many cuts to staff

Damian Green, the immigration 
minister, said: ‘No concessions have been made by the Government. Posts 
are being advertised to fill gaps left by normal staff turnover.

‘We are pleased that the PCS 
leadership has seen sense and called off this irresponsible strike which
 was not supported by the majority of members.

‘During the past week, our staff have shown fantastic dedication and commitment during an extremely busy period.

‘Queues at Heathrow have been almost 
non-existent and athletes and visitors from around the world have 
received a welcome of which the country can be proud.’

Mr Serwotka admitted the strike had 
triggered a backlash, with critics warning it would bring shame on 
Britain with the eyes of the world on this country.

He said: ‘We have been subjected to 
the most extraordinary level of vitriol and abuse in the last week 
[since the strike date was announced]. The abuse directed at front-line 
public sector staff is completely and utterly unwarranted.’

Mr Serwotka said it was absurd to have
 paid hundreds of workers to leave under the Government’s austerity 
cuts, only to take more on.

‘The taxpayer has actually paid out 
hundreds of millions of pounds in terms of redundancy and severance 
payments, in many cases to people who would much rather have been at 
work,’ he added.

A spokesman for airports operator BAA 
said: ‘So far passengers arriving for the Olympics have had a smooth 
journey through Heathrow and it is great news that those arriving 
tomorrow can also expect a warm welcome to London and the Games.’

The row has renewed calls  from senior
 Tories for a change in the law to ensure strikes can no longer be 
legally called on the basis of tiny turnouts of union members. Only 11 
per cent of PCS members voted to strike.
