Christian Benteke has scored four goals in four Barclays Premier League appearances against Liverpool – more than against any other opponent.

Liverpool have lost just one of their last 16 Premier League visits to Villa Park (W10 D5 L1).

Five of Gerrard’s 12 Premier League goals against Villa have been from penalties and five from outside the box, including two direct free kicks. The other two were headers.
