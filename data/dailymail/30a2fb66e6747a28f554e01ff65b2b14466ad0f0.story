A Filipino maid has been left covered in burns after her Saudi boss's mother allegedly threw boiling water at her as punishment for not making coffee quick enough.

The 23-year-old was not taken to hospital for hours, despite suffering scarring to her back and legs.

Once there, she passed her cousin's phone number to hospital staff and urged them to call for help.

Attack: This is the 23-year-old who was burned after her boss's mother allegedly threw boiling water at her

When she returned for a check-up, her cousin arrived to take her home. She is now in the care of the Philippine Embassy.

Outraged, her cousin has shared images of 'Fatma', which is not her real name, on Facebook.

The posts also claim Fatma was beaten by her employer and deprived of food.

According to ABS-CBN News, she was scalded after her employer's mother in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, became enraged at the time it was taking to brew coffee.

A tussle ensued, which led to Fatma being covered in the freshly boiled water.

The Facebook post read: 'This is my cousin, who works as domestic helper in Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia.

The employers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (pictured), also beat the maid within five days of her arrival, it is claimed

'Her female Saudi employer poured boiling water on her. She has 
only been in Riyadh for two months.

'She was beaten up within five days 
of her arrival by her male employer and was sometimes deprived of food.'

'She was only taken to the hospital six hours after boiling water was 
poured on her.

'She was then taken home to continue working despite her 
extensive injuries,' she said.

The country's Department for Social Welfare and Development is providing Fatma with medical care and accommodation.
