Police officers were confronted with an unusual distraction during a tense stand-off when a pug tried to start a fight with a K-9.

The dog, called Champ, broke through the police cordon and sprinted down the street while armed cops were in the middle of a four-hour siege.

A gunman, who had robbed a Subway restaurant, barricaded himself in his home in Phoenix, Arizona, while a tactical unit positioned themselves outside.

Outnumbered: The dog tried to attack the K-9 during a four-hour police siege

An aerial camera for ABC news 15 captured the bizarre moment, as the two dogs began barking at each other in the middle of the street.

As police urged the dog away from the dangerous scene, it desperately tried to return, but officers made sure it would not come back.

Eventually the pug made its way under the cordon before before heading back, tail between his legs, inside its owner's home.

The family, who were watching the action unfold from their garden, said they were prepared to say goodbye to their beloved pet forever, fearing it would be shot by police.

Janice Chacone said: 'I told my kids, if he gets shot, that is in with the police officers duties.

'I would never forgive myself if my dog ran off and caused one of the officers to die.

'Our dog became a distraction for them, which could have been an opportunity for the suspect to take some of them out.

'It was a little nerve-racking because you never know if there is going to be a gun battle in their neighbourhood.'

She added that the dog normally 'bolts' out of the front garden.
