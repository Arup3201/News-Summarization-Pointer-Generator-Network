A reckless driver ignored 'road closed' signs and drove through a swollen ford - and ended up on top of another stricken car.

The road in Hinxton, South Cambridgeshire, had been closed due to high water levels which had already caused a Volvo car to get stuck in the river.

But the driver of a Vauxhall ignored the warnings and drove into the flood water - only to be swept onto the roof of the Volvo.

Witness Eoin Shearing, from 
Duxford, Cambridgeshire., who took pictures of the scene on Friday, said the 
Vauxhall had become the 'latest addition to Hinxton scrapyard'.

Although the drivers of both cars managed to scramble free unhurt, villager Chris Angell, who spotted the vehicle on Saturday morning, said more signs or cones should be set up.

Mr Angell said today: 'It 
would help to have clearer depth signs and a bar to go across the river 
between the footbridge pillars to stop cars being washed under. There used to be one many years ago.'

Safety: The Vauxhall's driver managed to scramble free after ignoring the road closure sign at the weekend. The car was swept under the pedestrian bridge and only came to a stop when it hit the Volvo, which crashed into the water two weeks ago

'We nearly had one fatality a few years ago when a man from Newmarket, Cambshire., got swept under his car.

'He was rescued by a passing cyclist and I believe he was clinging to the footbridge.'

The Volvo was swept off the ford on November 23 after heavy rains swelled the river level.

On Friday the Vauxhall driver was swept under a pedestrian bridge in Hinxton Road before hitting the Volvo in the bloated river.

A Cambridgeshire Constabulary spokesman said no-one was injured in the incident which took place at about 3.30pm on November 23.

He said: 'We had a call from a driver saying their car had been taken into the river.

Closed off: A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'There were 'road closed' signs coming from both directions, but the driver chose to ignore them'

'A police officer went down there and
there were 'road closed' signs coming from both directions, but the 
driver chose to ignore them.

Meanwhile two men were taken to hospital suffering from suspected hypothermia at daybreak today after a dramatic rescue at Chesil Beach in Dorset.

Their rowing boat capsized, hurling them into the icy water in the famous Fleet lagoon at the beach where a road divides a freshwater lake from the sea.

While dog walkers and even the odd hardy surfer enjoyed today's bright and dry weather, forecasters say wintry showers could return to the UK later this week.

Another bad winter omen has already arrived on our shores — thousands of Waxwings have descended on Great Britain after the failure of the birds' food sources in their native Scandinavian breeding grounds.

The birds, pictured below feeding on rowan berries in London, are thought to be a sign of an imminent harsh winter.

Birdwatchers across the UK travel hundreds of miles to catch a glimpse of the rare birds. They are turning up in significant numbers every few years.

Some parts of the country will struggle to get above freezing on Wednesday and Thursday, with snow and freezing rain possible on high ground, according to Meteogroup, the weather division of the Press Association.

But the cold weather is likely to break on Friday, leading to a warmer but wetter weekend.

Sally Webb, a forecaster at Meteogroup, 
said today and tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry, with some showers 
on the North Sea coast.

But Wednesday will bring more cloud in southern England and Wales and the chance of wintry showers over high ground in Scotland and northern England in the afternoon after a clear start.

'Things start to change on Thursday, the cloud will thicken up before moving south and there are some light showers moving on ahead of a band of rain,' she said.

'Some of those could be wintry or freezing rain.'

Stunning sight: An unusual cloud over the north east of Scotland last night- described by weather experts as a nacreous cloud formation due to a chemical reaction 50 miles above the earth's surface

Rare: Nacreous clouds form in the stratosphere between 10 and 30 miles up and are made up of miniscule ice crystals forming at minus 85 degrees Celsius

Daytime temperatures in northern England and Scotland could struggle to top 2C (36F) on Wednesday and Thursday, she added, with some isolated spots failing to get above -1C (30F).

But by Friday temperatures will have risen, with averages of 10C (50F) in the south and 6C (43F) in the north.

Most areas will see rain, though it could fall as sleet or snow on high ground like the Welsh Mountains and the Yorkshire Dales.

The wet weather is set to continue into next weekend, with showers especially along the west coast.

Meanwhile an amateur astronomer captured rare mother-of-pearl coloured clouds over the UK.

The stunning pink formations, known as nacreous clouds, are caused by extreme weather conditions and rarely seen in Britain.

Graeme Whipps, 49, was stunned when he saw the pearlescent clouds in Chapel of Garioch, near Aberdeen in Northern Scotland yesterday evening.

'I have observed hundreds of aurora above Scotland, but this is the first time in 25 years I’ve seen these beautiful pearlescent clouds,' said Graeme, who works as a meteorologist.

Nacreous clouds form in the stratosphere between 10 and 30 miles up and are made up of miniscule ice crystals forming at minus 85 degrees Celsius.

They are typically seen in the winter months as the sun sets or rises and are illuminated by the sun’s rays from below the horizon.

Frozen stuck: A cow fell into this iced-over swimming pool in Windeck, Germany, and couldn't get out. 'We drained the pool and managed to haul her out using a tractor,' said a fire brigade spokesman

The iridescent colours are due to the ice crystals being of a uniform shape and size and the cloud covering being thin.

The sun has to be at just the right angle below the horizon to cause diffraction and interference with the crystals to produce the beautiful colours.

Scientists believe the clouds also help accelerate the process of the depletion of the ozone layer.

The clouds provide a surface for the chlorine and bromine in CFC’s to react into an active form, which makes the chlorine more destructive to the ozone layer.
