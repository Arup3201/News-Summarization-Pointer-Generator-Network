Outrageous: Samantha Brown posted this picture of her in a sparkly party dress on Facebook while on day release during a five-year sentence for the manslaughter of her boyfriend Dean Darvill

A woman locked up for stabbing her boyfriend to death has outraged her victim's family by posting a glamorous picture of herself on Facebook while on day release.

Samantha Brown has not yet served half of a five-year sentence behind bars for the manslaughter of 23-year-old Dean Darvill.

He bled to death after she stabbed him in the groin following a row when he accused her of having a lesbian affair.

Brown is being allowed out on day release to prepare her for freedom and it is believed she reactivated her Facebook page on a recent trip away from her young offenders' institution.

The 21-year-old has changed her account name to Sammii Priincess Brown and posted a picture of herself in a sparkly party dress.

Her victim’s family were alerted to what she was doing on the social networking website when she 'tagged' a number of old pictures, including of herself with Dean.

Dean's mother, Jacqueline Threatwell, was told by probation workers that Brown was to be allowed out on day release before her release, expected in July.

But they were outraged when they learned Brown, who has never expressed public remorse for the killing, used her freedom to show herself off on Facebook.

Dean’s uncle Steven Darvill, 42, said: 'It makes me angry. It makes my whole family angry.

'I don’t know how she has the cheek to set herself up on Facebook like that as if nothing has ever happened.

'She’s not supposed to have any contact with our family as part of her release conditions. I’ve reported her for it.

'It’s obvious she’s still looking at me and my family. She still has pictures of her and Dean on there.

'I’ve spoke to victim support and they’ve said they will look at it very seriously.

'It’s upsetting, especially for my sister Jackie. You would think she would come out quietly rather than start up on Facebook immediately and show so little respect for us.

'I can’t believe she can come out and call herself Sammii Priincess Brown and post a picture of herself wearing a party dress as if nothing ever happened. It’s disrespectful. It’s as if she’s saying "I’m back out - look at me".

'Yes, she’s got to come out sometime, but she should leave our family alone. Has she not done enough damage to Dean and the rest of the family?'

Brown admitted manslaughter after stabbing Dean, from Swinton, in the groin, severing vital arteries.

Other pictures on Brown's Facebook page include one of her with Dean (left), who bled to death after she stabbed him in the groin, and one of her with her sister Toni Brown (right), who was jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence after refusing Dean's desperate appeals for help

The attack took place during a party at the home of her sister Toni Brown in Wroxham Road, Blackley.

Toni Brown, 27, refused desperate pleas for her to call help for Dean. He died the next day in hospital. She was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter by gross negligence. She is also due out in July.

The sisters failed in bids to have their sentences reduced last November. Mr Darvill said he has asked to have a meeting with Samantha Brown before her final release.

He said: 'I want to see if there’s any remorse for what she’s done and to ask her why she did it.

'Jackie has her good days and bad days. But she’s still not really come to terms with Dean’s death. She goes to the cemetery most days during the week. To her, it doesn’t seem real that he’s gone.'

After Greater Manchester Probation Trust was alerted about Brown’s Facebook page, it was removed.

A spokeswoman said: 'She’s been spoken to by both institution staff and probation staff and steps were taken to remove the content, which was inappropriate.'
