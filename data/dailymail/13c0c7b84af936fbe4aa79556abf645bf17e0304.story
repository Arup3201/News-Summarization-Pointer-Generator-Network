Sentenced: Michael Eldin pictured arriving at Hull Crown Court where he was handed a suspended sentence for breaking Daniel Watson's ribs and colllarbone in an argument

A 20 stone man who crushed a drinker's ribs and broke his collarbone by sitting on him during a row in a pub garden has been spared jail.

Michael Eldin, 47, was told by judges that he had used his weight as a 'weapon' to pin his victim, Daniel Watson, to the ground.

Hull Crown Court heard that Eldin, who walks with a stick, had an argument with Mr Watson about his son in the garden of The Plough Inn in Snaith, East Yorkshire.

The father-of-two grabbed Mr Watson by the throat and pinned him against some wooden patio railings before repeatedly banging the victim's head.

When Mr Watson dropped to the ground, Eldin knelt on his 12 stone victim, breaking his ribs.

Eldin was given a four month suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay Â£200 compensation to Mr Watson which will be deducted from his benefits over the next year.

Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'All the evidence was on CCTV, it was very quick.

'He bashes his head against wooden railings five times and he kneels on his ribs. He is a large man and the complainant is very small.'

Mr Watson suffered two broken ribs and a broken collarbone in the attack.

Defending Eldin, Ian Phillip said: 'Both parties had been out drinking and the complainant accepts having more to drink.

'This is clearly out of character.'

Eldin, from Snaith, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm on September 8 last year.

The court heard his partner is not working and is in receipt of carer's allowance to care for Eldin.

Judge John Dowse told Eldin a 20st man's weight would be 'equal to a weapon'.

Sentencing Eldin, he said: 'You have committed a serious offence.

'I take into account you are not well and have a physical disability but, nevertheless, 20st of you came to rest on this complainant, causing him a fracture to his collarbone and ribs.

'You pleaded guilty and this was, in any event, out of character for you.

'This was violence in the street and as such must be punished by a prison sentence. However, in the circumstances of this case that sentence will be suspended.'

Judge Dowse warned Eldin to stay out of trouble or face the consequences.

He said: 'If you stay out of trouble, you will hear nothing more about it. It would be nice to think we will never see you back in this court again.'
