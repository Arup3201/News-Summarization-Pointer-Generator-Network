Manuel Pellegrini has challenged Manchester City’s players to prove they are one of the best teams in Europe as they attempt to overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona.

The City manager, under scrutiny after their surrender in the first leg and Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League, is convinced they can still qualify for the Champions League quarter-final.

Pellegrini said: ‘This is a good opportunity for our team and the only way to prove it is to beat one of the biggest teams in Europe and we have that chance.

‘We will try to do our best with dedication and hard work. We are not going to play against an easy team but I’m sure that if the three previous ties with Barcelona were 11 v 11 it could have been different.

‘We are going to have bad moments during the game but we have a team that can do its best in that type of game.’

Yaya Toure, returning from suspension, added: ‘We all know what we have to do, the owners have spent a lot of money to make this one of the top clubs in Europe. We have had some difficulties but we are working hard.

‘It’s not the first time we have been in this situation. We’ll try to do it for the fans and the club and the people who continue to help us.’
