With a storyline centred on the class divide, it was acclaimed as the novel which showed J.K. Rowling could address adult issues as well as she could weave magic for children in the Harry Potter books.

But now the BBC has come under fire over its adaptation of her novel The Casual Vacancy just weeks before the General Election.

The broadcaster has been accused of ramping up Left-wing issues in the book – by adding scenes which do not even appear in the novel.

Controversy: The BBC has come under fire over its adaptation of JK Rowling's novel The Casual Vacancy just weeks before the General Election

The three-part drama, which starts next Sunday and stars Sir Michael Gambon, Keeley Hawes and Rory Kinnear, paints a bleak picture of life in modern Britain and features storylines involving rape, drug abuse and racism. 

Set in the fictitious English town of Pagford, it features a community of rich and poor at war over the future of a community centre called Sweetlove House, home to social services including a drug rehabilitation centre and a food bank.

Pagford’s wealthier residents, who are fed up with the centre being a haven for ‘junkies and plebs’ from a nearby council estate called The Fields, want to close it for good and turn it into a luxury hotel and spa.

They are bitterly opposed by the liberal faction on Pagford parish council who believe it is essential for social cohesion.

Tory MP and former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the timing of the broadcast struck him as being ‘very odd at least’. 

He said: ‘In the run-up to a General Election, the Government quite rightly has to go into purdah and refrain from doing anything provocative. I think the BBC should have to apply the same criteria.’

The drama does not mention any political parties but critics say the battle over Sweetlove House is a thinly disguised attack on the Government’s welfare cuts, which will be one of the crucial issues for the May 7 Election.

In an interview in The Mail on Sunday, Rowling defended herself against accusations that her novel was a Left-wing attack on the middle classes.

She said: ‘I’m not anti-middle class in the slightest.

'Look at me! I am very pro people putting time and money and effort into trying to improve the world. And the middle classes do that very, very well. 

SCENE 1  

The BBC: In the opening scenes, Councillor Howard Mollison, played by Sir Michael Gambon, and his social-climbing wife Shirley (Julia McKenzie) discuss plans for a luxury hotel and spa development. A gleeful Shirley tells her husband: ‘It’s beautiful. You feel better just looking at it. You can’t let Barry Fairbrother and his tribe of do-gooders stand in the way of progress. They’ll have to accept that Sweetlove House has had its day.’

In the novel: The plan for a luxury hotel and spa does not appear at all.

 

SCENE 2

The BBC: Opposing the plans, Councillor Fairbrother says: ‘That is social engineering. That’s apartheid. Herding people into ghettos because they don’t fit the aesthetic. There is a name for that, isn’t there. Bill, you stormed the Normandy beaches didn’t you, fighting fascism... That house helps people to live. The parish council is not here to make a quick buck for someone who already has more than enough... Is the legacy still of benefit? Yes. It has never been so important.’

In the novel: Councillor Fairbrother dies on page two having hardly uttered a word.

 

SCENE 3

The BBC: When progressive councillor Parminder Jawanda tells her colleagues that drug addicts will have to travel to nearby Yarvil to get help, a rival tells her: ‘They would crawl on their knees over broken glass if there were drugs to be had.’

In the novel: She uses far milder language, saying addicts should have their benefits cut.

'I would be the last person to deny that, being middle class myself.’

BBC publicity states the drama is about ‘a town at war, rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils’.

The BBC adaptation also contains several explosive scenes not included in the novel. 

Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies in the first two pages of the book, but in the screenplay he lives long enough in the show to liken the closure of Sweetlove House to ‘fascism’ and ‘apartheid’.

BBC guidelines state that dramas which deal with controversial subjects should be flagged up in advance and that on occasion it may be appropriate to offer alternative views in other ‘signposted’ output. 

Tory MP Angie Bray, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: ‘This drama does appear to be sailing very close to the wind.

‘It won’t be the first time the BBC has shown this kind of bias in its drama output.’

Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg defended the BBC’s right to adapt the work of a novelist who he insisted was partisan and political in the same way as Dickens.

The Labour peer said: ‘This is a political novel in the sense that it is addressing what happens when society cuts off those people who they think are inadequate.’

Sarah Phelps, who wrote the screen adaptation, said: ‘The story is less about party politics and more about community. 

'It’s a great rallying call for humanitarianism and to see ourselves as absolutely connected and linked to each other.’

The BBC defended the timing, saying rules governing what could be broadcast before an election kicked in on March 30.

A spokesman said: 'BBC One is proud to bring J.K. Rowling's global best-seller and first novel for adults - from one of Britain's most popular authors - to the screen.

'It is a work of fiction which explores universal themes about family and social responsibility and does not mention party politics.'
