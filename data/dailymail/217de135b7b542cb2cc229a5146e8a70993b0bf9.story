Tensions over the Falkland Islands escalated dramatically last night after two UK cruise ships were refused entry to Argentina.

More than 3,250 passengers - 1,000 of them British - were on board the Adonia and Star Princess when they were ordered to turn back by port officials in Ushuaia, the main city of Argentina’s Tierra del Fuego province and the southern most city in the world.

Passengers on board the Adonia were informed by the ship’s captain that they had been banned from docking for ‘political reasons’ and were forced instead to head towards Chile to continue their journey.

Port problems: The Star Princess, with more than 3,250 passengers on board, was ordered to turn back by officials in Ushuaia in Argentina

The 77,500 ton Adonia, which has 
around 700 British passengers on board and 300 crew, left Britain on 
January 13, on an 87-night long voyage from Southampton to South 
America, and is due back on April 9. Passengers paid up to £30,000 for the round trip.

The 109,000-ton Star Princess is on a 
14-night tour of the Americas and set sail on February 18 from Rio de 
Janeiro with 2,580 passengers, of which 284 are British, and 900 crew.

The Adonia is part of a fleet of ships
 operated by P&O Cruises out of Southampton. The Star Princess, 
which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is run by Princess Cruises 
from Southampton.

Last night, the Foreign Office 
condemned the move by Argentina and said its diplomats in South America 
were ‘urgently’ seeking to clarify the circumstances surrounding the 
incident.

A spokesman said: ‘We are very 
concerned to hear the Adonia and Star Princess have been refused access 
to the port of Ushuaia. There can be no justification for interference 
in free and legitimate commerce.

‘British diplomats in Argentina are 
urgently seeking to clarify the circumstances surrounding this incident 
and we are in contact with the company concerned.’

Passengers on board both vessels - 
which left Port Stanley at the weekend after a brief visit - described 
how the routine stop on their itinerary was suddenly thrust into the 
spotlight as they prepared for a day-long visit to mainland Argentina.

Michael Campbell, 45, who was on board
 the Star Princess, said: ‘We have been caught up in what is essentially
 a bit of handbags between the two countries.

‘It is pretty immature from 
Argentina’s point of view. We are just being used as pawns by Argentina 
to make a point. It is ridiculous.’

Ushuaia port president Alejandro 
Berola told local reporters he had been ordered to prevent both cruise 
liners from docking by regional governor Fabiana Rios.

He also revealed Argentine war veterans and port workers had asked him in writing to turn both vessels away.

The move followed the passing of a 
controversial local law prohibiting ships with a British flag or flag of
 convenience that ‘plunder Argentine natural resources’ from docking in 
the area.

City tourism chiefs last night attacked the ban as ‘economic suicide’ and claimed holidaymakers were being unfairly targeted.

Mounting tensions: Prince William is currently in the Falklands, which has upset Argentine president Cristina Fernandez

Marcelo Lieti, President of Ushuaia’s 
Chamber of Tourism, using the Spanish word Malvinas for the Falklands, 
said: ‘This is an issue which has to be treated with a great deal of 
care.

‘We want the same as everyone else in 
Argentina for the Malvinas. But we believe that cruise liners carrying 
tourists have nothing to do with this issue.’

It comes amid heightened tension 
between Britain and Argentina over the Falklands ahead of the 30th 
anniversary of the war between the two countries.

Colonel Bob Stewart, former commander 
of British forces in Bosnia, said: ‘They are out of line. It is 
disgraceful and quite frankly it’s just silly.

‘We are big friends with the Argentine people, very big friends, and this is just totally daft.

‘If they want to stop cruise ships that will take away income from their country then fine.

‘I’m beginning to seriously worry why 
Argentina is jacking up this situation in the Falklands  and it’s all to
 divert attention away from home.’
