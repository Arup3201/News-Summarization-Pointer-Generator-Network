Rare outing: William and Kate at a friend's wedding at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Northleach, Gloucestershire, in 2010

Prince William is not a regular churchgoer despite being the future Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Daily Mail has learnt.

Although the 30-year-old future king was confirmed into the Anglican faith in 1997, he is understood to attend services of worship only a ‘handful’ of times each year. 

Most of these are connected with official engagements or on special occasions in the Christian calendar such as Christmas, as well as weddings and christenings.

Sources say William – and his wife Kate – ‘rarely, if ever’ go to church privately on a Sunday morning, or indeed at any other time in the week.

A senior aide also admitted: ‘I’m not aware that he goes every week.’

While William is not alone in being a non-attender – barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age – his stance is unlike other members of the Royal Family.

The Queen is a devout Christian, with a deep sense of religious duty, who attends church on a weekly basis. 

Prince Charles, despite his interest in other faiths, particularly Islam, has always been a regular churchgoer.

The revelation about William comes at a time when Christianity is already under threat from public apathy, particularly among the younger generation.

Just 10 per cent of the population now attend church each week, while the average age of worshippers has risen to just under 60.

According to one survey by Christian charity Tearfund, the UK is among Europe’s four least observant counties. Two thirds of those polled had not been to church in the past year, except for baptisms, weddings or funerals, although 53 per cent still identified themselves as Christian.

The monarchy, however, has a unique relationship with the Anglican Church.

The sovereign holds the title ‘Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England’.

In his or her coronation oath they also promise to maintain the Church, a vow that the present Queen takes very seriously. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, who in turn considers the names selected by a Church Commission.

They take an oath of allegiance to the Queen on appointment, as do parish priests, and may not resign without royal authority. Every five years the Queen opens the General Synod, the supreme authority of the Church of England, and any ‘law’ passed by it has to be given royal assent.

While there is little doubt  that when he accedes to the throne William will uphold these responsibilities, his decision not to  worship regularly will add fuel to the fire of those who argue that  the church has little relevance in Britain today.

The last known occasion William went to church was with his wife and her family in Berkshire on Christmas Day.

Before that the couple attended a service in the Solomon Islands in September as part of a South Pacific Diamond Jubilee tour on behalf of the Queen.

A spokesman for the prince insisted yesterday that he was a dedicated Christian despite his lack of regular attendance.

‘The Duke of Cambridge is a committed Anglican and has a strong personal faith,’ they said.

Aides also pointed out that not only was he confirmed in 1997 when he was 14, but he and his  wife wrote a prayer for their wedding service as evidence of his ‘continued faith’.

Confirmation marks the point  in the Christian journey at  which believers affirm for themselves the faith into which they have been baptised. 

Weeks before their 2011 wedding, Kate also chose to be confirmed.

The Archbishop of Canterbury’s office declined to comment last night, but a spokesman for the Church of England said: ‘In addition to obviously being sovereign, the requirement for a Supreme Governor is that they are “in communion” with the Church of England. According to the Book of Common Prayer this means taking communion three times a year.’

All aboard: The Queen yesterday

When the Queen’s Bentley failed to start
 after a church service in Sandringham yesterday, only one thing could 
do the trick – divine intervention.

Head chauffeur Joe Last was seen desperately trying to start the £10million car as she waited outside.

On the seventh attempt it burst into life but only after the Bishop of Chelmsford blessed the car outside St Mary Magdalene Church.
