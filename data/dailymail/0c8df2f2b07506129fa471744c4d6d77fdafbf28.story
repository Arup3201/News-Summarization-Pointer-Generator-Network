There's an old saying that claims behind
every great man is a great woman.

According to Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, 
the reverse is also true. In fact, she says the 'secret' of her success 
was marrying a man 20 years older than her.

Burns's husband Lloyd Bean also worked for Xerox as a scientist and researcher, but she was the real star.

The engineering 
hotshot started as a summer intern at Xerox and rose rapidly through
the ranks to become the first African-American female CEO.

Behind every great woman... Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, who was named Forbes' 14th most powerful woman in the world in 2009, says she owes her success to her older husband

In 2009, 
Forbes magazine called her the 14th most powerful woman in the world, 
and she's credited with helping bring the company back from the dead.

But it
seems that Burns, who was known for challenging conventional wisdom at 
work, wasn't afraid to do the same in her personal life. She saw her 
husband's age as an advantage instead of an obstacle because, according 
to The Wall Street Journal, he 'had already gone through this 'growing 
up' stuff.

Often, stories 
about massive age gaps feature pictures of Ronnie Wood or Hugh Hefner
holding hands with women young enough to be their daughters. But Burns 
isn't the only ambitious women to discover out that an older man's 
assets go way beyond the size of his wallet.

Older men are biologically wired to be more nurturing. As someone raised by a single mom in a Lower East Side housing project, this was undoubtedly an important quality to Burns.

Her mother ironed shirts and ran a day care center - making only $4,400 in her best year - to raise the funds to send her girls to a private Catholic school.

When Burns began studying engineering at Columbia University, her goal was to eventually support her mother. As her career and travel schedule became more demanding, her husband was able to retire and help raise their children (Burns has a daughter and a stepson).

Older men are also more emotionally bonded to their partners because testosterone begins to decrease after 40, while levels of the 'cuddle' chemical oxytocin stays steady.

This is why the ruthless CEO who was out the door at 35 wants to spoon after sex once he hits 50. It's also why first families get so annoyed when the man who was MIA becomes a doting husband and father the second time around.

I'm not in the same league as Burns when it comes to my career, but I did marry a man 20 years older than me.Â 

As a writer who climbed the ranks from intern to newspaper columnist and later author, having a supportive partner has been crucial to my continued success.

It wasn't always this way: In the past, my love life and career success seemed to be inversely proportional.

I was attracted to successful, charismatic, ambitious men whom I considered my peers and went through dozens of 'Mr. Bigs'. But the ones I would consider setting up home with often didn't consider me wife material.

The men I dated either became competitive professionally or expected me to have a more traditional, stay-at-home role.One ex, a banker, offered to pay me the yearly equivalent of my biggest-ever salary if I relocated with him to Hong Kong to be there for him when he got home from work.

'Don't worry darling,' he said, 'you can still do your writing as a hobby.'

Sadly, the assumption that my career should take a backseat to theirs wasn't uncommon.

'I was rooting for her. There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back'

Lloyd Bean, husband of Ursula Burns

Everything changed when I met Peter, a handsome and successful music manager 20 years older than me.

At first, the age difference seemed 
like the least obvious red flag. He had never been married, had a 
reputation for partying like the rock stars he managed, and brought 
several scantily-clad twenty-somethings to our first dinner date. But 
after being hyper-focused on work and his next conquest throughout his 
thirties and forties, he was now ready to ditch the entourage and focus 
all of his attention on me.

His age was a plus because, like 
Burns's husband, he was ready to grow up. So I married him, and now I 
have the best of both worlds: a man who is successful enough to 
understand my ambition, while at the same time happy to let me have the 
spotlight.

Other high-profile females have spoken out about the importance of choosing the right partner. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has openly praised her husband's willingness to split childcare and housework.

And for some power couples like Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, whose neurosurgeon husband Griffith Harsh IV moved from Harvard to California when she became CEO of eBay, the secret seems to be prioritizing and compromise.

So for ambitious women, it seems that the most important factor isn't a partner's age. It's his attitude.

'I was rooting for her,' Bean told CNN when asked how he felt about his wife's career eclipsing his own. 'There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back.'

Most successful people have learned the importance of picking the right person on the job. But since relationships can build us up or tear us down every day, the most important member of the team is the one waiting for us at home.
