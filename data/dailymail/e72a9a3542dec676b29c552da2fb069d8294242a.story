A federal judge on Monday sentenced a man who pleaded guilty to slapping a crying toddler on an Atlanta-bound flight to serve eight months in federal prison.

Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, was accused of using a racial slur to refer to the 19-month-old boy, who's black, and hitting him under the eye as the flight from Minneapolis descended to the Atlanta airport last February. He pleaded guilty in October to simple assault after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors.

Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of six months in prison, and Hundley reserved his right to argue for a lower sentence. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman said he imposed a higher sentence in part because of Hundley's criminal history, which includes a prior assault.

Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land

Hundley's lawyer, Marcia Shein, objected
 to the deviation from the recommendation in the plea agreement and said
 after the hearing that she believes the sentence is disproportionate.

Before
 he was sentenced, Hundley told the judge he took full responsibility 
for his actions and turned to apologize in person to Jessica Bennett, 
the toddler's mother, who was in the courtroom.

Hundley, who 
lived in Idaho at the time, was on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to 
Atlanta on February 8 and was seated in a window seat next to Bennett, who 
was sitting in the aisle seat and had her 19-month-old son on her lap, 
according to court filings.

As the plane descended into Atlanta, 
the child started crying. Hundley leaned over to Bennett and 'told her 
to shut that (N-word) baby up,' according to a sworn statement from an 
FBI agent who investigated the incident. Bennett asked Hundley what he 
had said, and he leaned in with his face next to hers and said it again,
 prosecutors have said.

Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that (n-word) baby up'

Hundley then slapped the child's face, leaving a scratch below his right eye, the FBI agent's statement says.

'When I looked at Jonahâ€™s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death,' Bennett said.

She says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since.

Hundley's
 only son was in a coma in Atlanta after an insulin overdose that was 
the result of a suspected suicide attempt, Shein has said. Hundley had 
spent the prior day talking to his ex-wife and doctors after his son was
 declared brain dead, Shein said, and he booked a last-minute flight to 
Atlanta so he and his ex-wife could take their son off life support.

'I made the most terrible day in my life much worse for me and for others,' Hundley told the judge.

Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers'

Bennett has said Hundley became increasingly obnoxious and appeared intoxicated during the flight.

Hundley
 has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings every day since March,
 is undergoing 15 hours of counseling a week and has been helping others
 deal with alcohol problems, Shein said. Hundley told the judge that he 
shouldn't have had any alcohol the day of the incident.

Shein 
argued that Hundley has taken positive steps to address his alcohol and 
anger issues and would be better served by house arrest or a halfway 
house.

Baverman said the case was difficult and emotional for 
everyone involved. He said he understands the grief Hundley was 
experienced and applauded the steps he's taken, but called the previous 
assault and probation for an alcohol-related offense troubling.

Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby'

'You
 cannot assault another individual, regardless of how sad or upset, or 
even how intoxicated or sick, you are,' Baverman said.

Fired: Hundley was an executive at AGC Aerospace & Defense before he was fired after the incident for what his company called disturbing allegations

In 
addition to the prison sentence, Baverman ordered Hundley to pay Bennett
 restitution of $105 and to pay a fine of $2,500 to the government.

Baverman also ordered Hundley to serve a year of supervised release, 
undergo alcohol abuse treatment and anger management counseling, and 
perform 120 hours of community service, preferably in a homeless 
shelter.

Hundley was not immediately taken into custody and will 
be allowed to report to prison once he gets an assignment. Shein said it
 was too early to decide whether to appeal.

Bennett gave an 
emotional statement to the court before sentencing, saying her son 
immediately changed from a bright and curious child to one who was 
guarded and scared. For her part, she suffered fear, anxiety and 
depression as a result of the attack, she said.

Bennett said after the hearing that she was satisfied by the sentence and didn't believe Hundley's apology was genuine.

'It is my belief 
that Mr. Hundley is a bully,' Bennett told the judge. 'He saw an easy 
mark in a woman with a young child to unleash his bigotry.'

Hundley

 was fired from his executive position at AGC Aerospace & Defense in
 the aftermath of the media firestorm spark by the altercation, his 
attorney said.

Injuries: Mrs Bennett said she was 'scared to death' when she saw that Jonah's eye was swollen

Situation: The incident occurred on a Delta flight on February 8, 2013

The Oklahoma City-based military technology company issued a statement describing the executive's behavior as 'offensive and disturbing.'

Lawyers for Hundley had said in court filings that the amount of media coverage his case received was highly unusual for a misdemeanor charge and added that 'it is impossible to avoid the reality that the national media has painted Mr. Hundley as a villain.'

Hundley's son, whose age was not given, died the day after the flight, Shein said.

Hundley 'has paid a terrible price for his hurtful words,' his lawyer said.

He previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in 2007 after he was arrested following a fight with his girlfriend.
