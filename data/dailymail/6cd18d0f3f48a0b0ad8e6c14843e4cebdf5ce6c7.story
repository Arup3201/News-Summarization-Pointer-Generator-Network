Tottenham finished second in Group C of the Europa League after a disappointing 1-0 defeat by Besiktas at the Ataturk Stadium. Sportsmail's Adam Shergold rated the players' performances on Thursday night.

Tottenham

Michel Vorm  6

Had nothing apart from a few misguided crosses to deal with in the first-half as Tottenham kept the occasional Besiktas threat at bay with ease. Beaten at close quarters by Cenk Tosun for the goal but was let down by his defence. 

Kyle Walker 7.5

Making a very welcome return after nine months out with an abdominal problem. Involved from the outset and offered a useful outlet for Tottenham with his surges down the right-wing. Clearly still has that ability to beat his man and cross. A very encouraging return. 

Vlad Chiriches  6.5

Dealt with everything thrown his way during a first-half in which Tottenham’s defence was rarely troubled. Cleared the ball on six occasions and made nine interceptions to block off the Besiktas supply lines.

Younes Kaboul  7

Effective in mopping up at the back, looking composed when in possession and playing the ball out from the back. Good with aerial clearances as ever and got his head on Paulinho’s free-kick to tee up Soldado for a gilt-edged chance that he wasted. 

Danny Rose  7

Very lively during the opening stages, taking Besiktas on down the left and using pace to beat his man. Had a chance midway through the second half that didn’t trouble Zengin in goal. 

Benjamin Stambouli  6

Came within an insole of getting a touch towards the Besiktas goal in the early stages. Was largely accurate with his passing and dictated the tempo in the midfield. Recovered possession on half-a-dozen occasions and was tenacious in challenges.

Mousa Dembele  6.5

Played a nice through ball to set Soldado free down the right channel on 23 minutes but nothing came of it. Was able to drive powerfully through the middle on a number of occasions. 

Andros Townsend  6.5

Not too many glimpses of his lightning best but was afforded respect by the Besiktas defence. Lovely through ball into Soldado just after the half hour but the Spaniard fluffed his line. 

Paulinho 6.5

Delivered some good corners and free-kicks which caused problems for the Besiktas defence during the first-half. From one, Kaboul nodded down to set up Soldado. Was less effective after the break and went off on 69 minutes.

Nacer Chadli  6.5

Swung in an early left-sided cross that narrowly evaded the head of Soldado and looked a handful in the penalty box. Produced a cheeky finish on 25 minutes but was correctly flagged offside. Saw a chance early on bobble tamely into the hands of Tolga Zengin. Was given more licence to push forward after Paulinho and Soldado went off but couldn’t grab a leveller. 

Roberto Soldado  5

The striker’s misses once again cost Tottenham. He had a golden opportunity in the first half when Kaboul met Paulinho’s lofted free-kick and put a chance on a plate for him. Soldado swung and barely connected. And when Townsend played him clear shortly afterwards, he shot straight at the keeper. Disappointing once again.
