Radamel Falcao has admitted for the first time that he is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season.

The Colombia star has stayed silent amid speculation that United will reject the opportunity to turn his £5million loan from Monaco into a permanent £43m deal.

But Falcao conceded on Tuesday that he will probably have to look elsewhere for regular first-team football, having not started a game under Louis van Gaal for the last month.

Radamel Falcao dropped a major hint that he could leave Manchester United when his loan expires 

‘Obviously I need to find a place where I have continuity and can play,’ Falcao said in Bahrain, where Colombia play a friendly on Thursday. ‘I think any footballer needs to play and is happy playing.

‘So when the championship ends surely I’ll sit down, do an analysis and decide what’s best for me.’

Falcao has scored just four goals in 22 appearances for United, where he earns £280,000 a week, and was made to play for the club’s Under 21 team earlier this month. His mentor and former agent, Silvano Espindola, revealed last week that the player has been reduced to tears by his treatment at Old Trafford.

Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old striker but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations.

‘Calls come every day so in that sense I’ve got to stay calm, but I keep on the fringe of them, there are people who deal with all that situation,’ said Falcao.

‘I owe myself to Manchester United at the moment, I have faith and hope because lots of things can happen in the number of matches remaining. I will continue to fight to the end at Manchester United.’

While United are happy to let Falcao leave Old Trafford, they will do all they can to ensure that £59.7m record signing Angel di Maria stays.

The Argentine is said to be unsettled in England just seven months after arriving from Real Madrid. 

Falcao came on as a substitute in United's win against Liverpool on Sunday and has scored just six goals

Di Maria’s form has dipped after a bright start and his family have been unhappy since an attempted break-in at their Cheshire home last month.

United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, meanwhile, has refuted suggestions that his presence in the team leads to a long-ball game, saying: ‘We play beautiful football.’

Robin van Persie could return against Manchester City on April 12 following a month out with ankle ligament damage.

United have no plans to let £59.7million record signing Angel di Maria leave the club in the summer though
