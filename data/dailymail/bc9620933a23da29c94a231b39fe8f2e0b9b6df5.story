Byron Maxwell has swapped the Legion of Boom to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles. 

Cornerback Maxwell is the first addition to one of the NFL’s worst pass defences, with the Super Bowl-winner departing Seattle despite a late bid by the Seahawks to retain him.

‘I'm going to Philly,’ the 27-year-old told ESPN.

Since taking over as starter from Brandon Browner in 2013, Maxwell was used as an outside corner and in nickel packages. He was frequently targeted instead of shutdown corner Richard Sherman and fared well, with two interceptions and 12 passes defenced last season.

Rated as the top cornerback in NFL.com’s top 101 free agents, Maxwell strengthens a threadbare secondary after the release of Cary Williams and with Bradley Fletcher entering free agency.
