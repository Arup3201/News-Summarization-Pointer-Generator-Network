Naomi Campbell has been allowed back on British Airways flights after the airline lifted a five-year ban

Naomi Campbell is back on board 
British Airways – five years after she was arrested  for being abusive 
on a flight  and barred from the airline.

The
decision to allow the supermodel to return comes despite her accusing 
BA staff of racism, and assaulting police officers as they hauled her 
from the aircraft.

The Mail
on Sunday understands that some BA workers are upset by the decision to
allow her on flights – including a First Class flight to Milan on May 3
this year.

Staff are said to feel the ban should
have been maintained, and accused bosses of giving the model ‘special 
treatment’ because of her wealth and fame. 

Ms
Campbell, 43, boarded the Milan flight at  Heathrow Airport in London accompanied by the 
airline’s special services staff who  give VIP treatment to First  Class
fliers.

An insider said: ‘Naomi upset a lot 
of staff, so to have her back on BA flights feels like a bit of a kick 
in the teeth.

'The company should be taking a hard line against people 
who are abusive or aggressive – whether they are rich and famous or 
not.’ 

Ms Campbell was 
banned after a row over her luggage at Heathrow Airport in 2008.

A court 
hearing was told she ranted at the aircraft’s crew before she was 
ordered off.

She was fined £2,300 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service for the incident.

A British Airways spokesman said this week: ‘Due to data protection, we are unable to disclose passenger details.’
