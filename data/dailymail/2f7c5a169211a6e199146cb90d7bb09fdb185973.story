Bill de Blasio opened the doors of New York City's Gracie Mansion to thousands of public ticket holders on Sunday in an unprecedented housewarming for the new mayor and his family.

De Blasio will be only the tenth mayor to live in the historic Upper East Side Federal-style home, which the Bloomberg administration raised millions to renovate for public viewing.

'I'm thrilled to welcome New Yorkers from across the City into the People’s House,' de Blasio said of the tour using the nickname given the home by Bloomberg, who's be very critical of his successor's decision to move into it.

He and his family welcomed thousands of curious visitors into their 200-year-old new home Sunday morning at the conclusion of a week during which the entire city of 8 million residents welcomed de Blasio as their new mayor.

'It’s been a pleasure sharing the inauguration with residents from all five boroughs, and I can’t think of a better way to end the week than by spending it with New Yorkers,' de Blasio said in a release.

Bill de Blasio took the oath of office on Wednesday, formally becoming the 109th mayor of New York City while pledging to pursue a sweeping liberal agenda.

'Big dreams are not a luxury reserved for a privileged few but the animating force behind every community, in every borough,' he said in his speech.

Criticism: The over 200-year-old Federal style mansion was built in 1799. Former Mayor Bloomberg has never lived there has criticized preemptively criticized any future mayor's decision to do so

That vision included an unusually open inauguration ceremony.

De Blasio welcomed the public to his swearing in, an occasion usually reserved for VIPs and city insiders.

While residents thrilled to get a peak inside the mansion at such a newsworthy moment are no doubt supportive of de Blasio's event, Michael Bloomberg is likely tisk-tisking the media savvy move.

Bloomberg never lived in the mansion and has for years criticized pre-emptively any future mayor who decides to live in the 1799 home overlooking the East River.

Luxurious: The home has played host to events for some of the world's most beloved dignitaries including the late Nelson Mandela

'Family decision': After debating whether to move to the Manhattan mansion or stay in their beloved Brooklyn neighborhood, the de Blasios decided to live in the decadent digs. No one has lived in Gracie Mansion since Rudolph Giuliani left office in 2001

'A lot of people want to be mayor — you don’t have to give them extra money as a housing allowance,' the billionaire said in 2012.

Bloomberg is rumored to have raised some $7 million for a renovation of the historic home, which is steeped in New York City and American history far more than it is precendent for mayoral occupancy.

Even the first mayor to move into the home, Fiorello H. LaGuardia in 1942, is remembered as having done so begrudgingly.

But the de Blasios, who previously 
hailed from the liberal Brooklyn enclave of Park Slope, say living in 
their private home now poses security issues.

De Blasio announced his move in a letter titled Family Decision that he was posted to his website in December. In it, the mayor made clear the move is only a temporary, physical one.

'This
 is our home.' he said, referring to his Brooklyn residence. 'This is 
our life. This is our neighborhood, and we’re Brooklynites. We’re 
obviously Brooklynites, and we’ll always be Brooklynites.'

Gracie Mansion is located on a site that was purchased in 1646 by Dutch farmer Sybout Claessen, who called his land Horn's Hook after his hometown of Hoorn, Holland.

More than a century later, merchant Jacob Wealton built a house on the farmland, which was commandeered by George Washington's troops during the American Revolution because of its strategic location - directly across the loyalist stronghold of Queens

In 1799, a prosperous New York merchant named Archibald Gracie built a country house overlooking a bend in the East River, 5 miles north of the City.

Financial failure forced Gracie to sell his house to Joseph Foulke in 1823, and in 1857, the house came into the possession of Noah Wheaton. The City of New York appropriated the estate in 1896, incorporating its 11 acres of grounds into the newly-formed Carl Schurz Park.

After decades of use as a concession stand and restrooms for the park, Gracie Mansion was restored and became the first home of the Museum of the City of New York. Soon after the museum moved to a larger space on Fifth Avenue, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses convinced City authorities to designate Gracie Mansion as the official residence of the Mayor, and in 1942, Fiorello La Guardia moved in.

Gracie Mansion was enlarged in 1966 with the addition of the Susan E. Wagner Wing, which includes a grand ballroom and two intimate reception rooms.

In 2002, the interior and exterior were again restored, and the house was transformed into the ‘People's House’ with increased accessibility to the public and to City agencies.
