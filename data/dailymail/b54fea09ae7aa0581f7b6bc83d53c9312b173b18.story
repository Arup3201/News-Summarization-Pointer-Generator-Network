They might be wanted for large-scale human atrocities - but North Korea's dictatorship doesn't half care about a decent biscuit. 

In his latest show of relentless self-promotion, Kim Jong-Un, the leader of North Korea, took time out of his busy schedule to inspect the bread, cakes and biscuits being made for the country's military.  

The portly leader visited the 'November 2' Korean People's Army factory, where he was pictured giving advice on how to make the perfect baked goods.

The secretive state released images of the young dictator closely inspecting the biscuits, as staff behind him diligently took notes on his baking tips.

In the posed-up shots, released by the Korean Central News Agency, the Supreme Commander was captured laughing and joking with the staff.

He was then pictured leading a meeting, offering advice about the manufacturing process at the plant. 

The plant is where goods are produced for those in the Korean People's Army, of which Kim Jong-Un is Supreme Commander.
