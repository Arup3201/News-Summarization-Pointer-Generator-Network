Accident and emergency nurses in the hospital at the centre of the Stafford care scandal were 'punished' if they spent too much time caring for patients by 'draconian management', a tribunal heard today.

Nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at Stafford General Hospital if they breached the four-hour limit for treating patients and 'made a spectacle of', it was claimed.

The allegations came at a misconduct hearing into the standard of care provided by two nursing sisters at the hospital at the centre of the Francis Report into care at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation NHS Trust. Hundreds of patients are said to have died there unnecessarily.

Accused: Nurses Tracy White, left, and Sharon Turner, right, who worked at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital ordered staff to fake casualty records to meet waiting time targets, a hearing was told

Tracy White faces five charges of 
misconduct relating to patient care and falsifying waiting times, and 
Sharon Turner faces six, including falsifying waiting times, patient 
care and racist conduct, relating to their time in charge of the A&E
department in 2007.

Katherine Kelly, a former sister 
there, said there was a 'culture of bullying' amongst senior management 
who shouted at nurses who breached waiting limits.

She added: 'The management at the 
time was draconian and nurses were often marched up to the executive 
office in relation to breach times in the A&E department.

'The A&E sisters would also frequently be in trouble for allowing breaches of the four-hour target.'

She added: 'Nurses were punished by 
the trust if they spent more time with the patients, if this resulted in
them breaching the four-hour target.

'Nurses who had fewer or no breaches 
received high praise from management. Nurses who had breaches were made a
spectacle of and made to feel they were no good at their job.'

Whistleblower: Helene Donnelly has claimed she was 'ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times

The punishment was normally 
unofficial, she said, including one sister who was 'undermined in her 
role' by having junior nurses do her job instead of her.

Ms Kelly told the tribunal that in 
October 2007 Turner told a nurse, Helene Donnelly, 'my advice is to lie 
about the breach time', when she rang through from the minor injuries 
section saying they had patients who were about to clock up four hours 
in A&E.

Ms Kelly told the hearing that 
although at the time she assumed it was said seriously, when she made a 
statement last year she thought it was 'off the cuff', and now did not 
know either way.

Mrs Donnelly, who gave evidence to 
the Francis Inquiry, told today’s hearing that patient records were 
'routinely' doctored in the 'chaotic' department, which lacked a 
permanent manager at the time, to hide breaches in waiting time limits.

A white board carrying patient 
details often had admission times rubbed out, something which would have
been seen by management, she claimed.

White is alleged to have told a 
seriously ill elderly patient who later died that she was a 'naughty 
little monkey' who was just constipated and had not taken her laxative.

She allegedly refused to help lift 
the woman from a wheelchair on to a bed, saying: 'I’m not doing this. 
I’m not hurting my back. We don’t need to get her on a trolley anyway, 
she is going to breach (waiting time target) in a minute,' and telling 
the junior doctor examining her to help with another patient.

The woman, known as Patient B, was discharged but died the following day from a pulmonary oedema.

White is also accused of saying 'she 
can wait if you can do that to your baby' when a woman came into A&E
suffering from bleeding after having an abortion.

Turner is accused of making racist 
comments, including likening an Asian junior doctor to a suicide bomber 
and describing another as 'Osama’s mate'.

A third was frequently derogatorily 
referred to as 'him in the turban', and a female gynaecologist pointed 
out as 'her in the yashmak', Mrs Donnelly claimed.

Turner, who was described as 
'foul-mouthed', is also accused of swearing about patients where they 
could hear her, saying they 'can f****** wait', 'they want to get 
f****** real' and 'I don’t give a flying f***'.

James Townsend, representing both women, said they did not say the things they are accused of.

He questioned Mrs Donnelly’s memory 
of events six or seven years ago and accused her of targeting the nurses
because of 'bad feeling' toward them over remarks made about her 
mother-in-law - a nurse at the hospital - and a complaint made about her
own conduct. She denied this.

Ms Kelly said Turner’s dry sense of humour could be 'not politically correct' but with no intended malice.

'Sharon would get very frustrated 
about a group of Asian junior doctors who would only speak to each other
in their own language, which was not English,' she said.

'I recall that Sharon would make tongue-in-cheek remarks highlighting that the junior doctors were being rude.'

White and Turner contest the charges.

Yesterday whistleblower Helene Donnelly said sometimes staff were in such a rush to get patients out of casualty within four hours that staff 'left patients to lie in soiled sheets to meet the targets.'

Recounting one occasion where she was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White's handwriting.

But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery was hers, the panel heard.

'I realised Sister White would have been happy for me, a junior nurse, to taker the blame for her actions,' said Mrs Donnelly.

'As a result of this, absolutely nothing happened to Sister White in terms of disciplinary action.'

Both Turner and White were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008, but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them.

Worrying: Nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at Stafford General Hospital if they breached the four-hour limit for treating patients and 'made a spectacle of', it was claimed

During their suspension, Mrs Donnelly said she 'incurred the wrath' of their friends in A&E.

Mrs Donnelly said of their return: 'Nothing had been learned other than how to break the rules more subversively.'

She said: 'Sister White would deliberately make patients wait. Black patients were being made to wait.'

The nurse, who resigned in June 2008 because of the toxic environment, said: 'The attitude of the sisters had not changed.

'I knew I had to get out.'

The ongoing central London hearing is expected to last ten days.
