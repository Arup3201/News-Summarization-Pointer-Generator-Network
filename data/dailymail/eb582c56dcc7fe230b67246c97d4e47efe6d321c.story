Boris Johnson has made a surprise visit to the Kurdish frontline in Iraq to observe British troops helping train  local fighters battling ISIS.

The Mayor of London's visit to the Kurdistan region is said to have been prompted by the recent increased threat level in the British capital.

During his visit, Mr Johnson lay side-by-side in the mud with Peshmerga fighters, joining them in their shooting practice near the Kurdish capital Erbil in Iraq.

Mr Johnson said there was a 'mutual interest' in the 'security and prosperity' of Kurdistan and Iraq as a whole.

British military personnel in Kurdistan are training the region's Peshmerga forces, who have been involved in some of the heaviest fighting against ISIS.

A source said: 'He wants to see first hand the work being done to keep ISIS at bay, the same ISIS that wants to send back terrorists who would blow themselves up in London given half a chance.'

The main focus of Mr Johnson's visit, made at the invitation of Kurdish prime minister Nechirvan Barzani,  has been to boost trade links with the Kurdistan region.

Mr Johnson said: 'Over the last decade Kurdistan region has seen considerable economic growth and social development, and I'm here to mark London's role as an active ally in this.'

He added: 'We have a mutual interest in not only Kurdistan region's security and prosperity but that of Iraq as a whole.

'The links between Britain and the Kurdistan region are developing at an incredible pace, there is a dynamic and forward looking leadership here and I am looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and discussing greater cooperation on a range of issues.'

The mayor was accompanied on the visit by the British consul general to Kurdistan Angus McKee and Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born to Kurdish parents in Iraq and retains close links with the region.

He visited the airport in the region's capital Erbil to see the work of the British companies involved in building and running it and was briefed on the airport management's desire to secure the first ever direct flights to London from the city, which would provide a significant boost to trade between the UK and Kurdistan region.

Making friends: The main focus of Mr Johnson's visit has been to boost trade links with the Kurdistan region

Earlier this week the Foreign Office was urged by MPs to strengthen diplomatic ties with Iraq's Kurds.

The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said the Kurdistan region in Iraq was a 'beacon of tolerance and moderation' in a part of the world beset by extremism and instability.

But while the regional government in Irbil was anxious to develop links with the UK, the committee warned that the current level of diplomatic resources committed to the region was 'not adequate'.

The Mayor's visit to Kurdistan follows reports that he 'caved in' and paid up a U.S. tax bill for several thousand dollars.

Mr Johnson is born in the U.S. and has dual citizenship and as an overseas American he is obligated to pay income tax.

American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000.

The can also be taxed on capital gains on selling a main house made anywhere in the world.
