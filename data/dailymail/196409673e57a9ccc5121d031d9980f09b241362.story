Josh Powell was travelling in a silver Peugeot 306 convertible with a 25-year-old man in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, at 3.15am this morning.

South Yorkshire Police say the car left the road negotiating a slight left-hand bend, hitting a street lamp and continuing along the footpath, through a garden and into the front of a local property, causing extensive damage to a boundary wall and the front of the house.

The Ministry of Defence has confirmed Mr Powell was a British soldier serving in the Light Dragoons.

The 25-year-old, who has not been named, is at Barnsley District General Hospital with 'life-threatening injuries', the police have said.

It is not clear which of the two men, both of Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire, were driving, but it is understood they were the only occupants of the car.

Officers believe the car was travelling in excess of the speed limit when it left the road.

The owners of the property the car smashed into, Carl and Julie Jackson, have asked that floral tributes are not left near the address.

The owners of the house have described being woken up at 3.15am by what sounded like an 'earthquake'

The couple described being woken up at 3.15am by what sounded like an 'earthquake'.

Mr Jackson, 50, who works for Yorkshire Water, said: 'I feel absolutely terrible for the parents of that young lad.

'The police say they believe the car may have been speeding but at the end of the day, a life has been lost.

'We've got damage to the house, but that can be fixed. What's happened to that poor lad can't.'

Mrs Jackson, a 49-year-old cleaner, said: 'Our bedroom is right above the living room, which is where the car crashed into. We heard this massive bang, it felt like an earthquake.'

Mr Jackson said: 'I looked out of the window and saw this car on its side upside down outside our house.

'I could see smoke coming from it so I told Julie we needed to get out. Our grandaughter and son were in the house so we got them up and all went outside, I was worried the car was going to burst into flames.

- Property owner Carl Jackson

'I looked round the front of the house and could just see two boys lying in front of our front door. They had been thrown out of the car.

'Our neighbour, whose window had been smashed by the lamp post the car hit, had called 999.

'I went and got one of my fire extinguishers to put the fire on the car out. It was only a small fire, not an engine fire, so it went out quite quickly.

'The ambulance arrived within minutes and soon after the police and the fire brigade. By that point, the whole street were outside to see what was going on. It was chaos.'

Anyone who witnessed the incident or the car's movements prior to it leaving the road should call South Yorkshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 218 of Sunday 19 May 2013.
