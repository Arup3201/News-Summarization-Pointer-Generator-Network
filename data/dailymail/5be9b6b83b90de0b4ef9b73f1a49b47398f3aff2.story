David Cameron has asked Boris Johnson to help ‘reach parts of the electorate other Tories can’t’ in secret talks on the general election campaign.

The London Mayor – who yesterday appeared with Darcey Bussell on the South Bank in yet another slightly absurd photo opportunity – is understood to have agreed to play a leading role next year.

The two men, seen as the Conservative Party’s biggest rivals, made their peace over lunch at the Prime Minister’s country residence, Chequers.

Mr Johnson will focus his campaigning efforts in London, which he has won twice as Mayor in the face of a strong Labour challenge, and in northern marginal seats.

He will also target first-time voters, aged between 18 and 22, among whom he is popular, according to party strategists.

Mr Johnson has yet to make up his mind about whether to return to Parliament in 2015, as Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have urged – publicly at least.

But his agreement to return to the national political scene, regardless of whether or not he runs for a seat in Westminster, will electrify next year’s election race.

Despite their rivalry, Mr Johnson’s skills as a frontman are highly rated by both Mr Cameron and the Tories’ Australian campaign chief Lynton Crosby, who helped him win in London.

The Mayor demonstrated his ability to get away with the most unorthodox campaigning techniques yesterday in an appearance with Strictly Come Dancing star Darcey Bussell and a group of Bolivian folk dancers.

The London Mayor enthusiastically joined in Miss Bussell’s moves on the South Bank to promote an initiative called the Big Dance, which aims to get people fit through dancing.

Mr Johnson’s ability to emerge from even the most outlandish photo opportunity with his reputation intact – or even enhanced – is seen as crucial to his appeal by Tory strategists.

In their Chequers meeting, thought to have taken place two weekends ago, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson also agreed that they should make more joint appearances.
