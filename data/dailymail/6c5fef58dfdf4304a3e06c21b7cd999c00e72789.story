The family of murdered Colorado student Claire Davis has said if Littleton Public Schools make all details regarding the incident  public, they will agree to never sue the school district.

Michael Davis, the father of the Arapahoe High School senior who was shot at point-blank range by student Karl Pierson in 2013, put forward the proposal on Monday.

If the district accepts the terms, Claire's family would sign a binding agreement to never seek damages against it or its staff in exchange for learning everything the school knows about the murder.

This comes following criticism last year that the district did not act on warnings that they received indicating that Pierson was dangerous. 

Prior to the attack, Pierson was identified as a potential threat and in school documents it was revealed that administrators were aware student had the emotional capacity to carry out a plan to murder a teacher he was upset with, according to KDVR.

And police later revealed that Karl had intended to target his debate coach Tracy Murphy - months after he had already shouted a death threat against the coach in a school hallway.

On December 13, 2013, 18-year-old Pierson, armed with a shotgun, ammunition strapped to his body, Molotov cocktails and a machete, entered the school and headed toward the library, seemingly intent on killing Mr Murphy.

Davis, 17, who was shot while sitting with a friend, appeared to be a random target, Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said following the incident two years ago.

She would not have had time to get out of the way as Pierson entered the school and started shooting just after 12.30pm that day.

Sheriff Robinson said that Claire was 'an innocent victim of an evil act of violence', 7News reported.

There was no indication that the gunmen knew her or was acquainted with her.

Sheriff Robinson said the incident had been extremely brief, lasting one minute and 17 seconds from the time Pierson entered the building armed with the shotgun, several rounds of ammunition, and three petrol bombs, to the point where he shot himself.

A friend who was with Claire at the time dragged her to safety in a nearby yoga class, according to the Denver Post.

Following the shooting, Claire was rushed to hospital and placed in a coma. But despite medics' best efforts, she died eight days later. She was surrounded by her family at the time. 

Sheriff Robinson said that Pierson legally purchased the shotgun on December 6, a full week before the incident.

'His evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,' Sheriff Robinson said.

Pierson threw one of the petrol bombs into the library where Mr Murphy, who is also the school's librarian, worked. The explosion set fire to three bookcases. 

Sheriff Robinson said that when the teenager heard the school's police officer pursuing him, he took his own life.

If the district agrees to accept Mr Davis' proposal, it would join an arbitration proceeding waiving forms of governmental immunity and make all records concerning the incident available to the public, but some allowances would be made for protecting personal privacy (above students gathered for a candlelight vigil after the shooting)

If the district agrees to accept Mr Davis' proposal, it would join an arbitration proceeding waiving forms of governmental immunity and make all records concerning the incident available to the public, but some allowances would be made for protecting personal privacy.

The proceeding, if the district agrees, would not include a trial.

Claire's father is hoping the district will consider his proposal during their meeting next Thursday.
