Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the way his side now react to suffering their first back-to-back Barclays Premier League losses this season will be vital to how their campaign pans out overall.

After being beaten 3-0 at Southampton last Saturday and then 1-0 at home by Stoke on Boxing Day, the Toffees - who came fifth last term and had been targeting the Champions League places this time around - are 12th in the table, 11 points off the top four.

They have only won one of their last six league games, with four of those ending in defeat, and struggled to create much going forward in what was a physical encounter with the Potters.

Martinez’s men are next in action on Sunday at Newcastle, another outfit who will be keen to make the most of the opportunity to boost their points tally following a sequence of disappointing results.

And ahead of the trip to St James’ Park, the Spaniard said: 'I don’t think in general we are lacking confidence, but I think this is a moment of the season that is pivotal for us - seeing how we can react.

'The reaction now has to be that we make sure we know what we are doing. We have a real understanding of how to perform and if we can keep that, the results will come.

'But football gives you these sorts of challenges, and this is the challenge of the season. We need to make sure we get through this period stronger than ever, and that could really give us a very strong second half of the season.'

Martinez admits Everton have not been 'in a great moment' of late, but was keen to stress that against Stoke in particular 'nothing that could have gone our way did go in our favour.'

He was critical of referee Lee Mason’s decisions to only yellow-card apparent last man Jonathan Walters for pulling back Leighton Baines in the first half and then award a penalty to the visitors moments later, having adjudged James McCarthy to have fouled Bojan Krkic, who converted the spot-kick himself.

Everton midfielder Gareth Barry was also surprised Walters was not red-carded.

Barry, quoted by the Liverpool Echo, said: 'To me, at the time, it looked as though he (Baines) was going through clear on goal.

'Leighton was making the forward movement and travelling a lot quicker than anybody else. He (Walters) was the last man so I expected the red.'

With regard to his side’s inability to make real inroads against Stoke, Martinez suggested an 'accumulation' of things had made life difficult for the hosts.

In what seemed a slightly backhanded compliment to the Potters, he said: 'What Stoke wanted to do helped them. They did really well coming here and trying to stop the play, making it difficult to be an open game.

'I think they defended really well, but I don’t think we have seen a good spectacle because I don’t think that was the intention of the opposition.'

Martinez added: 'Also, we have very good, talented young players but they need a bit of direction and I did feel we missed that leadership from Tim Howard and Phil Jagielka in the second half. That was frustrating.'

Goalkeeper Howard and skipper Jagielka were forced off at half-time due to calf and ankle problems respectively and look likely to miss the Newcastle game.

Additionally, Jagielka’s fellow centre-back John Stones and winger Kevin Mirallas are doubtful due to knocks they picked up in the Boxing Day match.

The fixture also saw forward Steven Naismith receive a fifth Premier League booking of the season, meaning he will be suspended for Sunday’s encounter.

Newcastle, who are 10th, head into that game off the back of three straight league defeats.
