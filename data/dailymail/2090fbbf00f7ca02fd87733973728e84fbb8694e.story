Charged: Jail worker Jill Curry, 38, was arrested Wednesday on charges of sexual misconduct with an inmate

A female jail worker accused of sexual misconduct was arrested on Wednesday in Washington County, Oregon.

Jill Curry, 38,  was charged with six counts of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and six counts of first-degree official misconduct, Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt Bob Ray told the Oregonian. 

Sgt Ray did not elaborate to say which inmate Curry reportedly had contact with or at which jail.

However, according to the statute, the charge involves engaging in sexual acts with someone in custody. 

'While there's a presumption of innocence in our justice system, this employee is accused of extremely serious misconduct,' said Sheriff Pat Garrett in a statement.

'If the allegations are found to be true then this employee completely violated my trust and the public's trust and will be dealt with swiftly and appropriately.'

The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician.

The caller has not been identified by authorities.

Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation.

She has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center.

After her arrest, Curry was booked into the Washington County Jail and held on $120,000 bond.
