A U.S. Coast Guard ship has rescued an Australian fishing boat that became stuck in heavy ice in Antarctica   for three days with 26 people aboard.

The American vessel rescued the ship on Saturday and begun towing the 63-meter (207 foot) longliner to open water after freeing it from Antarctic pack ice.

According to reports, the Chieftain became trapped in ice some 900 nautical miles (1,650 kilometres) north-east of McMurdo Sound after damaging its propeller a week ago.

All 26 crew members on the longliner are not at risk and there has been no oil leak in the environmentally sensitive area.

The US coast guard cutter Polar Star was ordered to cross through 720 km of iceberg-strewn waters to the ship's aid.

According to the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Center, which oversees the Southern Ocean search and rescue zone the US ship reached the trawler early on Saturday. 

The New Zealand-flagged trawler Janas is also travelling to the area to provide assistance if required but is not expected to reach the vessels until late Monday.  

The rescue boat, which had a reinforced icebreaker hull had to break the ice around the stricken ship, according to ABC.net.au

Rescue mission coordinator Conrad Reynecke said in a statement: 'The crew on the Polar Star then rigged up tow lines and began to tow the Antarctic Chieftain to open water.'

'They are making slow but steady progress and are currently approximately 60 nautical miles from clear water.'

The Americans had earlier deployed a remote-controlled mini-submarine to assess the damage to the Antarctic Chieftain's propeller and gauge if it could travel under its own steam.

'The [propeller] blades were assessed as too badly damaged for the vessel to be able to use them for propulsion from the ice field,' Reynecke added.

At present the weather conditions are favourable but Polar Star commanding officer Captain Matthew Walker said earlier the ice conditions were 'much more formidable than expected'.

Australian Longline, the ship's owners, said that the vessel spent six months at a time in Antarctic waters fishing the prized species, which was also known as 'white gold' for the profits it could yield.

The Antarctic Chieftain, built in 2002, is licensed to trawl for Patagonian toothfish, a slow-growing species that has a type of anti-freeze in its blood to deal with the punishing southern conditions.
