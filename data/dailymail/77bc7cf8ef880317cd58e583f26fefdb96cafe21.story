A petty criminal has begged police to send him to prison - because he cannot bear to be at home under house arrest with his wife.

The man from Rome pleaded with officers at the Tor Bella Monaca police station after spending nearly three months of constant fighting with his spouse at home.

The unnamed 37-year-old was quoted as telling officers: 'Put me inside, otherwise it will end badly,' he was quoted as telling police.

The father-of-three was less than three months into his sentence for a string of petty crimes Il Messaggero reported.

But with another eight to go, it seems it all became too much for him to stand and he decided prison was better than staying at home.

Police have been called to Largo Ferruccio Mengaronito resolve the couple's constant arguing, The Local reports.

The man has since been transferred to Rome’s Regina Coeli prison after the authorities granted him his wish.

Earlier this year, a 32-year-old man who was under house arrest in Tuscany for drug dealing, pleaded to be sent to jail to escape his wife.

The police said at the time: 'Living with his wife was particularly difficult and unbearable.'
