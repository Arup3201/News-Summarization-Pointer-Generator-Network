A six-day-old baby boy said to have 'spontaneously combusted' is being tested by doctors in India.

The child was admitted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) in Chennai after allegedly bursting into flames and is being given round-the-clock care.

The boy's mother, who gave her name as K Rajeswari, said her baby caught fire on Thursday, six days after he was born, with his feet bursting into flames.

A six-day-old baby boy said to have 'spontaneously combusted' is being tested by doctors in Chennai (pictured), India 

A team of five doctors at KMCH, including paediatricians, psychiatrists and plastic surgeons are running tests on the boy.

Dr N Gunasekaran, dean of the hospital, said: 'We have sent wound swabs for tests. The results will be out in two days.

'We will decide on further tests and treatment on Monday.'

This is not the first time that Ms Rajeswari, 22, has claimed that one of her children has spontaneously caught fire. 

Ms Rajeswari (right), 22, claimed in 2013 that her other son Rahul had also spontaneously combusted

She brought her three-month-old son Rahul to the hospital in August 2013 and claimed he had caught fire - for the fourth time.

Doctors ran a series of tests on the boy and found that he had not spontaneously combusted, raising concerns that he may have been abused by relatives or burnt in an accidental fire.

‘People thought I set him on fire deliberately,’ his mother, Rajeswari said at the time. 

Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) has been implied as a cause of death in a number of documented cases where burned corpses have been found without an apparent external source of ignition.

An estimated 200 cases have been found throughout history and victims are often elderly, sick, or under the influence of alcohol, which would explain why they have not been able to escape the flames.

Puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘wick theory’ to explain such events. The theory is that the human body can become an ‘inside out’ candle

The person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance, that keeps the blaze going.

Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top.

Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark.
