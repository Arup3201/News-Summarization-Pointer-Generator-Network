A retired watchmaker who set up a cannabis factory in his garage shot a burglar who was trying to break in to his remote farmhouse, a court heard today.

Malcolm White, 63, fired at Robert Richards when he caught him trying to smash his living room window in October 2011.

The burglar, who fired back at the homeowner before fleeing in a getaway van, was so badly injured when he was arrested that doctors had to amputate his right leg.

But White insists that the shooting was an accident, and has pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm at Worcester Crown Court.

A jury heard that the retiree spent 20 minutes locking up the garage which contained his £18,000 cannabis farm before he reported the attempted break-in at his £420,000 home in Whitborne, Herefordshire by Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26.

He told officers he believed the robbers had been after his Audi A8 sports car - but failed to inform them he had shot one of the thieves.

The jury was told that White had a total of 20 firearms stashed around his home, and boasted to partner Josephine Merrick that he 'shot the bastard' during the botched burglary.

Investigation: Police found £18,000 worth of cannabis plants at the house when they searched it

Prosecutor Simon Phillips said that White was 'no ordinary householder' and shot Richards in order to 'protect his turf'.

He continued: 'The reality was, Mr White knew this raid was a possibility and took the initiative to shoot Mr Richards before he knew it.

'He was protecting his turf and was prepared with a number of firearms around his property.

'In Mr White's garage was a valuable and extensive crop of cannabis. He was somebody who had something to protect.'

The barrister told the court that the couple's home was 'set apart from other houses', making it easier for White to conceal his drug farm, for which he had bought £20,000 worth of equipment.

When police searched the garage they seized 60 plants worth up to £18,000 but capable of producing £60,000 of cannabis a year.

Case: Ms Merrick was sentenced to unpaid work over the cannabis factory at her home

Mr Phillips said: 'Mr White and Josephine Merrick were watching television when someone began banging on the living room window with a tool of some sort but were unable to gain access.

'Mr White turned to Josephine Merrick and said, "I'll get the bastard" before she escaped into the hallway. She then heard three shots - boom, crack, crack.

'She then heard a man's voice shouting "He's got me" and "We've got to get him out of here," before a sound consistent of people moving away from the house.

'Next, she went to the living room and saw through the smashed window essentially Mr Richards and Mr Randall doing a runner.

'Mr Richards was found with Mr Randall by passersby and then police outside a Chinese takeaway in nearby Leigh Sinton.

'Josephine Merrick wondered where Mr White was, she noticed the upstairs lights were on, they were previously off. Mr White then came in from the kitchen when she said, "Did you get him?"

'To which he replied, "Yes I got the bastard." She said, "Is he still alive?" And Mr White said, "Yes, he's still walking, I think I got him in the leg, I wish I would have finished him off."'

During a police interview, White said he thought he had shot the gun in the air, adding that he believed the men were trying to get to his car or his partner. He said he had been growing drugs for four or five months.

Ms Merrick was ordered to perform 15 hours of unpaid work and given a 12-month restraining order after she pleaded guilty to producing a controlled substance last month.

Richards was jailed for 10 and a half years and Randall sentenced to 13 years and four months after they were convicted of aggravated burglary in February.

The trial continues.
