Former drug smuggler Howard Marks – once known as Mr Nice – has revealed he has inoperable bowel cancer.

The 69-year-old, who spent seven years in a US prison, was diagnosed in autumn last year but said he has now ‘come to terms with it’.

And after selling more than a million copies of his memoir, published in 1996, and being captured on screen by actor Rhys Ifans, Mr Marks says he has no regrets.

Former drug smuggler turned bestselling author Howard Marks has revealed he has inoperable bowel cancer

The 69-year-old, pictured in 2013, who spent seven years in a US prison, was diagnosed in autumn last year

‘I’ve come to terms with it in my own way – which for me was about learning how to cry,’ he told the Observer.

‘It’s impossible to regret any part of my life when I feel happy and I am happy now, so I don’t have any regrets and have not had any for a very long time.’

He added he feels privileged to have lived an ‘incredible’ life, which allowed him to spend time with ‘musicians, DJs and other lovers of dope’.

The author said he has received messages of support from his vast range of celebrity friends, including Sir Richard Branson and artist Tracey Emin.

And next month, friends – including Mr Ifans – will be holding a concert in north London in his honour.

The concert, at the Kentish Town Forum on February 27, will feature Welsh band Super Furry Animals.

Funds raised will go towards Mr Marks’ cancer treatment, help set up a charitable foundation and the completion of a documentary about his unusual life.

Mr Marks was diagnosed with cancer last year and doctors told him there was nothing they could do – and the disease has now spread to his liver and lungs.

The Observer reported he has completed eight cycles of chemotherapy and responded well to the treatment.

Mr Marks, who has four children, is being cared for by his long-term partner Caroline Brown.

Now, his aim is to continue his battle for the legalisation of marijuana.

‘Of course the legalising of marijuana for medical purposes is to be welcomed, but personally I never wanted to have to wait until I had cancer before I could legally smoke.’

Born in 1945 in Kenfig Hill, south Wales, Howard Marks' father was in the merchant navy and his mother was a teacher.

After attending grammar school, he read physics at Oxford - which is where he became involved with drugs.

As a drug smuggler in the 1980s, he had 43 aliases, 89 phone lines and 25 companies trading worldwide as fronts for money laundering.

In 1980, he married Judy Marks but split in 2003 and divorced in 2005. 

He was given a  25-year sentence for drug smuggling in America, but was released in 1995 after serving seven years.

In 1996, his memoir Mr Nice, sold more than a million copies and was made into a film starring his friend and fellow Welshman Rhys Ifans. 

He became a festival regular and gave talks around the country, as well as campaigning for the legalisation of cannabis.

In 1996, Super Furry Animals released a song called Hanging With Howard Marks.

He has a long-term partner called Caroline Brown and four children.
