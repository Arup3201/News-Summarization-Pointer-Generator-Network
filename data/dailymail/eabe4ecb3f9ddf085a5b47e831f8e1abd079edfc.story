An order of service booklet, from Hughes' funeral service at his home town of Macksville on Wednesday appeared on eBay, midway through the service.

On eBay as 'Phillip Hughes Australian cricket funeral service program' it was put up for auction with the starting bid of 99 cents with the location as Macksville.

The listing also included a number of photos of inside the booklet and had a selling time of seven days.

The program has now been taken down by eBay which was done a short time after it was listed for sale.

eBay says 'they have been doing manual sweeps of the site a few times a day since Friday and removing listings that appear to be profiting from the tragedy.'

'These listings are completely inappropriate and we will continue to remove them should they appear again,' said eBay spokesperson Megan English.

Last week, when most of the nation was mourning the tragic death of the 25 year old, a number of callous Ebay users also tried to cash in and begun listing various items connected to Hughes on the popular trading site.

eBay then decided to remove all Phillip Hughes memorabilia listings and said they were scanning the site in the days and weeks ahead to remove any offending items
