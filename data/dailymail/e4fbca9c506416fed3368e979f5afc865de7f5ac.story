For Dennis Wise, one incident encapsulated what it was like to be a member of Wimbledon's infamous Crazy Gang as they changed the landscape of English football in the 1980s.

'Our new centre-half Eric Young kept turning up for training with his Brighton bag,' recalls Wise. 'We'd had enough of it so it got burnt. It was our way of saying, you're not with Brighton any more, you're with Wimbledon. We stick together and do everything together. That was the culture back then.'

Wise is going down memory lane to promote a new TV film about the assortment of misfits and failures who helped make the Wimbledon story. It's a tale of how a club went from non-league to FA Cup winners at Wembley in just 11 years, through a mixture of hunger, talent, chaos and casual violence.

For Barnado's boy John Fashanu, hod carrier Vinnie Jones and Southampton reject Wise, being part of the Crazy Gang was a platform to achieve even greater things in and out of football.

Others like Young, a trained accountant, were less taken with the aggressive nature of the club, and don't feature in the hour-long programme which was screened to the media on Thursday night and will later be shown on BT Sport, on Boxing Day of course.

Many of the Wimbledon anecdotes are well-known, like chairman Sam Hammam forcing his players to eat sheep testicles in a forerunner to I'm a Celebrity. Jones – now a Hollywood actor – reveals in the programme they also set fire to team-mate Alan Cork's car so he could plead poverty for a new contract, and said he was startled by the way Fashanu in particular intimidated young players at the club, and opponents. 'Fash the Bash' as he is known is accused in the programme of beating up a player 'like a rag doll'.

'You either grew a backbone very quickly or you dissolved as a man,' admitted Jones.

Wise, now 47 and out football since he left Newcastle United as executive director in 2009, admits: 'You couldn't do some of the things we did nowadays. Player have to be a bit more disciplined than in our time, it was quite handy there weren't camera phones around then or some very big stories would have come out.

'Times were different then. We were young, learning things and we had some fun. At the time, we didn't think we were being that unusual but 25 years later, you do think 'Wow', what the team achieved from where all the players had come from. For a lot of us, it was a second chance, most of us hadn't quite made it and the timing put us all together. You could imagine the steps people like Vinnie would take.

'People looked at us in a way they perhaps shouldn't have because we were eager to learn and we had decent players. I realised straight away they had something different about them, and when Vinnie came two months after me, we hit it off straight away. He was best man at my wedding and whenever he's over in England, we meet up. We've been to a Watford game this season and I got a text from him this week from where he lives in America.'

For players like Wise and Jones, Wimbledon was a second chance for a number who hadn't made it

Wimbledon were hated by the football establishment. They became known as a long-ball team under Dave Bassett. When Bobby Gould took over and appointed Don Howe, one of English football's most respected coaches, the Wimbledon players told him in no uncertain terms the way they liked to play, and could he improve them within those confines. Howe originally only meant to stay for a few weeks but ended up being an important part of their FA Cup success in 1988.

Even then, the underdogs did it their way against mighty Liverpool. Jones and others chanted 'Yidaho' as a rallying cry in the tunnel before the game to the bemusement of Liverpool's stars and the midfielder then sent Steve McMahon, Liverpool's hard-man, flying in the first minute. Wimbledon won the final 1-0 with Lawrie Sanchez heading in Wise's free-kick.

'There were some big personalities in that dressing-room,' said Wise. 'Not just Vinnie and Fash, but Sanch, Andy Thorn, Dave Beasant. They had a desire that whatever they did, it would be to the best of their ability. I had a big personality within the group even though I wasn't so big in stature. They knew if they needed someone, I was there with them. I was accepted by the group, we relied on each other.

'It hasn't surprised me that Fash went on to present Gladiators and then became a big businessman, or that Vinnie is in Hollywood. They were very ambitious and wanted to achieve things in football, and after.'

Some players didn't react well to the verbal and physical intensity in the group as they competed with the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal on crowds of less than 10,000.

Irish international defender Terry Phelan, who later went to Manchester City, says on film: 'I saw players actually cry from the abuse – physically break down and cry.'

Wise, who stands 5ft 6ins and was just 18 when he stepped into Plough Lane, is thankful he was spared any initiation ceremony.

'I was lucky. Wally (Downes, the assistant manager and many say the creator of the Crazy Gang) knew my parents, they were good friends so they probably weren't so harsh on me as others. They more like took me under their wing.

'I had been there for a two-week trial and after four days I was lucky enough that (manager) Dave Bassett wanted to sign me. Geoff Taylor who looked after the youth didn't, but Dave liked that work ethic I had. I was always at the front in training, would always win the long-distance running and didn't mind spending time out on the pitch and practising.

'It was a complicated situation because I'd turned down a new contract at Southampton, went on trial to Crystal Palace but they didn't want me, went back to Southampton and Lawrie (McMenemy) said the contract offer was no longer on the table. So a guy called Pat Deller, who was a taxi driver but did scouting for Wimbledon, suggested me to them.'

The way Wise ended up at the Crazy Gang wasn't unusual. Jones had been non-league player with Wealdstone when he signed, John Scales had been released by Leeds United and was finding his way again with Bristol Rovers when he was picked up by the Dons.

Many of the Wimbledon team had been released by Football League clubs or spent time in the non-League

It was one of the features of why the Crazy Gang happened. Wise admits some of the stunts could not be repeated but insists teams spirit and camaraderie is still vital to success.

'I've been lucky enough to go down to watch Chelsea train, I know John Terry very well (they were Chelsea team-mates) and Jose Mourinho was good enough to let me down there.

'John knows it doesn't matter if the players speak a different language, they have to be together and at Chelsea you can sense it. It doesn't matter where you've come from, it's only important that you are together. That is what Wimbledon was about to me.'

BT Sport premieres The Crazy Gang on Boxing Day at 9pm on BT Sport 1.
