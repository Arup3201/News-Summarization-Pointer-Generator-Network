One of Boris Johnson's former deputies defected to UKIP today - just hours after the London Mayor claimed Tory 'quitters' were the type of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners.

Former London deputy mayor Richard Barnes announced his decision to leave the Conservatives with a parting shot at his party for failing to ‘speak the language of normal people’.

Mr Barnes, who served under Mr Johnson between 2008 and 2012, was embroiled in controversy last year after naked selfies were posted on his Facebook account.

Boris Johnson's former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes defected to UKIP from the Tories today

It was initially thought that his iPhone had uploaded the shots automatically, but the politician insisted he had fallen victim to hackers.

His defection was announced today just hours before Mr Johnson is due to deliver his main speech to the Tory conference in Birmingham later.

In a cameo appearance at a rally last night, the London Mayor urged the ‘the great conservative family’ to unite to defeat Labour.

He also mocked UKIP defectors turning up at A&E with ‘barely credible injuries’ inflicted through ‘vacuum cleaner abuse’.

Referring to EU Commission plans to ban high-powered vacuum cleaners, Mr Johnson said: ‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster - the budgerigar through the bars of the cage.

‘And I have read that there are some people - probably the type who are thinking of defecting to Ukip - who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’

Mr Barnes today hit out at the Tory party for being out of touch with ordinary people. He said: ‘There seems to be a detachment from ordinary people’s lives in the Westminster Village.’

David Cameron and the London Mayor have been stung by three defections from the Tories to UKIP since last month

The former top Tory said he wanted the UK to leave the EU and return to a free trade agreement with the continent.

He also dismissed David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe as ‘unrealistic’, and accused the Government of failing to address immigration concerns.

The news came as Mark Reckless was officially installed as Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern - the traditional way of quitting the Commons.

Mr Reckless was unveiled as Nigel Farage’s latest Tory catch at the UKIP conference on Saturday, triggering a by-election in his Kent constituency of Rochester and Strood.

It came after rebel backbench MP Douglas Carswell stunned Westminster last month by announcing that he was leaving the Tories to join UKIP. 

The twin defections have forced other Conservative MPs to deny they are planning to join Mr Farage’s party.

The former deputy London mayor said he had been the victim of hackers

Wrekin MP Mark Pritchard told BBC Shropshire his ‘beating heart is Conservative’.

‘I’ve been a member of the Conservative party for a very long time and I intend to stay in the Conservative party,’ he said.

‘Yes, I’m an arch-Eurosceptic, I’ve been involved in most if not all of the supposedly Eurosceptic moves in the parliamentary party over the past few years and that will remain the same.

‘I want us to have a referendum on Europe, and I believe the only way that can be delivered is with a Conservative government. Labour won’t, the Lib Dems certainly won’t, and with the best will in the world I don’t think even Nigel Farage on a good day will say there’s going to be a Ukip government.’

Mid Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries has also insisted she will not be the next to defect.
