She is due to give birth in just a few weeks.

But there is no slowing down for Chelsea Clinton.

Despite quitting her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC last month to focus on her baby, the 34-year-old was seen pounding the streets of New York yesterday looking serious in a business-like shirt and blazer.

Looking swell! Chelsea Clinton sported a huge baby bump as she ran errands in New York yesterday

Not long now: She is due to give months in a few weeks but will work for the Clinton Foundation until then

She spoke animatedly on the phone between errands as she continues to organize events for the Clinton Foundation.

Bill and Hillary's daughter announced that she was pregnant with her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky in April.  

Her growing baby bump means her mother's bid for presidency could soon become a reality.

Hillary Clinton vowed to postpone running for the nomination until she became a grandmother.

So heavily-pregnant Chelsea will have been a welcome sight to supporters of a second Clinton administration.

She had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work.

Taking it easy? The former first daughter quit her $26,000-a-minute job at NBC last month to focus on her baby

Just the ticket: Her growing baby bump will have been a welcome sight to voters backing Hillary Clinton for the Democrat nomination. Chelsea's mother vowed to postpone her bid until after she had become a grandmother

The network confirmed her exit on last month. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled.

Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News.

Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying Clinton $600,000 annually before it was scaled back to a month-to-month deal in January.

Her last piece for the network aired on August 1. 

Politic reported on Friday that Clinton's salary had worked out at an estimated $26,000 for each minute she appeared on air.

Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010.

Ready to go: The 34-year-old and her banker husband will likely raise the child in Gramercy, New York City

Peacemaker: The pregnancy seemed to be a bonding topic for Chelsea's father Bill and rival George W. Bush

Advice: Bush warned Clinton he will soon be much further down in the family pecking order after the birth

Side stage: Hillary, here watched her husband and Bush talk, has refused to push her nomination until the birth

The couple live in a $10.5million condo in the Gramercy area of Manhattan.

Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News, praised Clinton today and didn't rule out working with her in the future.

She told People: 'Chelsea's storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities.

'While she will be missed, we look forward to working with her in the future.'

Her exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016.

The birth also seems to have settled awkward relations between her father and his former political rival George W. Bush.

Appearing together to unveil a new Presidential Leadership Scholars program, the pair laughed and joked about being grandfathers.

Bush warned Clinton: 'Get ready ... to be like the lowest person in the pecking order in your family.'
