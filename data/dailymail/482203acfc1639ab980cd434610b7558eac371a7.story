Arsenal's players have fixed the title in their sights after finding the secret to winning a trophy and hearing Arsene Wenger claim he has more attacking prowess at his disposal than he has had for years.

After winning the FA Cup and the FA Community Shield, there is a mood of optimism at the Emirates Stadium that this can be the season when they can mount a serious challenge for the Barclays Premier League title.

'That is the target,' said striker Olivier Giroud. 'Last year we did well until March. We had a bad run after but we really wanted to come back and be stronger than last year. When our Germans join us we will be stronger for sure and hopefully until May.'

Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker returned to the Arsenal training ground on Monday for the first time since their World Cup triumph.

Wenger would rather not rush the German trio back into action but Mertesacker may have to be involved against Crystal Palace on Saturday because there is a shortage of centre-halves.

Laurent Koscielny came off at Wembley as a precaution after feeling tightness in his Achilles but hopes to be fit.

Up front, however, there will be a wealth of options when everyone is available, with Alexis Sanchez, signed from Barcelona for Â£32million, adding pace and excitement. Yaya Sanogo will improve in his second year at the club and Joel Campbell has been recalled after a series of loan moves.

'We have a good quality squad and now the quantity so that's why I think we will be stronger this year,' said Giroud. 'I have played with Alexis in training and have a good understanding with him. It is like when Mesut signed. It's always easy to play with these kind of players.

'He has different qualities to me, Sanogo and Campbell. He can bring his pace and technique into the centre and he's a great finisher. Maybe he will need some more games to adapt his game to the Premier League but that's normal and he's a fantastic player so I think he will have a great season.'

Arsenal's last title win was in 2004, when they completed the season without defeat and Wojciech Szczesny admitted there was a growing sense of excitement about the season about to start.

Three days after they start against Palace, Wenger's team will face Besiktas in Istanbul in the first leg of their Champions League play-off. They play Everton, Manchester City and Tottenham before the end of September.

'We're looking strong,' said Szczesny. 'It was a great result against City. We're not reading too much into it but I thought we played well and it looks like we're more than ready. We defended really well and limited them to a couple of chances.'

There was a sly dig from the goalkeeper at Bacary Sagna, who quit the Emirates on a free transfer to Manchester City and has been replaced by Mathieu Debuchy.

'Except for Thomas Vermaelen we've not lost any key players,' he said. 'Even if someone did leave on a free, we've managed to replace them with good players.

'We're looking stronger and we're happy with that. Looking at it on paper, it probably is the strongest squad we've had in my time. Hopefully it will be the most successful.'
