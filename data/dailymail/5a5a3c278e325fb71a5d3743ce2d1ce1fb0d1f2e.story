This could be the most lucrative ‘light-bulb moment’ ever.

An artwork which consists of nothing more than lights turning on and off in an empty room is expected to fetch up to £70,000 when it is auctioned by Christie’s next month.

But the winning bidder will not even get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate the controversial piece – just a certificate of authenticity, signed by British artist Martin Creed, giving permission to use the idea.

Bright idea: British artist Martin Creed's Work No 127, which consists of light bulbs 
being turned on, pictured above, and off, is expected to fetch £70,00 
when it is auctioned by Christie's in London next month

The winning bidder will not get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate
 the piece but will receive a certificate of authenticity, signed 
by the Turner Prize-winning artist, giving permission for the person to use the idea

The work has split the art world, with critics claiming it is the ultimate example of the ‘emperor’s  new clothes’ while others celebrate a radical example of ‘art as an idea’.

Christie’s is understood to be employing an electrician to set up  its own version of Work No 127: The Lights Going On And Off so potential buyers can experience a room switching from light to darkness every 30 seconds.

Charles Thomson, the head of the Stuckist Group of traditionalist artists, condemned Creed’s installation as ‘a mundane experience’ rather than a work of art. He said: ‘It’s not so much a question of the lights going on and off it’s a question of the brain going on and off.

‘People are effectively being asked to pay £70,000 for something they could reproduce quite easily in your own home. It just shows the complete madness of the current thinking in the art world.’

Creed, 46, created the work in 1995 as a precursor to his near-identical piece No 227: The Lights Going On And Off – this time at five-second intervals – which went on to win the Turner Prize in 2001.

The decision to award Creed the £20,000 prize proved to be one of the most controversial in the competition’s history and protesters picketed the ceremony.

Madonna, who subsequently presented the award, described art prizes as ‘silly’ and said there could be no correlation between good art and money.

But she said: ‘I want to support any artist who not only has something to say but the balls to say it.’

Work No 227 was subsequently bought by the Tate Gallery for more than £100,000, and it could be another gallery that buys No 127 at Christie’s. It is being sold by the current owner, a private collector.

For your own Turner-winning work, follow our simple instructions:

1) Depress light switch as illustrated.

2) Wait 30 seconds.

3) Repeat until you are offered £70,000. Or have an electrician install a timer for £200.

Creed is now regarded as one of the leading conceptual artists in the country. Other works have included a sheet of A4 paper scrunched up into a ball (No 88), a lump of kneaded Blu-Tack stuck on a wall (No 79), and athletes running through the galleries of Tate Britain (No 850).

Michael Daley, the head of ArtWatch UK, said of the lights installation: ‘It’s only an artwork in the narrow loopy confines of the modern contemporary art establishment. Christie’s are just selling pretentious junk to chumps who want to buy into “cool”.”

But Sir Norman Rosenthal, one of Britain’s most respected art historians, said: ‘I am a fan of Creed and I think he has a place. His work is not over heavy. It’s very slight and sexy and good fun. I can see the point.’

Sir Norman said he probably wouldn’t want Work No 127 in his front room, but added: ‘Art is not like that. You don’t have to like it. You are not obliged. But if you are involved in the language and the discourse of art then yes it is art.’

Other works in the Christie’s Post-war and Contemporary Art Sale in London, on July 1 will include Tracey Emin’s My Bed – being sold by Charles Saatchi for an estimated £1 million – and a portrait of the artist Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon, which was owned by Roald Dahl and is valued at up to £12 million.  

Martin Creed was last night unavailable for comment.
