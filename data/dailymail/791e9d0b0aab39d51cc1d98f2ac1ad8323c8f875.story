Locked up: Michael Jones, 34, had sex with the 16-year-old student at school and at his home

A high school technician has been sentenced to 13 years behind bars for having sex with a student half his age as many as 40 times - often on school property.

Michael Jones, a 34-year-old married father-of-two from Ormond Beach, Florida, must also join the sex offender's register and serve 15 years probation after his release from prison.

Before Jones was sentenced for having sex with the then-16-year-old girl - whom he met when she was just 14 - his family and friends had testified that the girl was also responsible for the affair.

But the judge slammed these claims as 'absurd', the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported.

'To make that comment I think flies in the face 
of reality when you are looking at a 32-year-old man and a 16-year-old 
child,' Circuit Judge Leah Case said. 'To even put those two people on the same level 
playing field is absurd.'

Prosecutors said that Jones, who worked as a technician at the school for seven years, had the girl excused from class so they could have a tryst at Seabreeze High School.

They met when the girl was just 14, but had sex for the first time two years later.

'I think what makes it particularly aggravating in this situation is that this is not a person who met up with (the victim) at a bar and didn't know her age,' Case said. 'This is a person who knew her when she was 14 years old.'

Trysts: He began texting her after getting her number from one of her friends, and they went on to have sex as many as 40 times before maintenance workers caught them in the auditorium

The victim, who is now 19, said she first thought Jones was creepy when she texted him after getting her number from one of her friends.

Eventually, she started speaking to him more, and realized they had both lost their fathers when they were young, a fact they bonded over, the News-Journal reported.

The pair first had sex when a school club he had set up went on a trip to St Augustine. They later had sex at school, Jones' house, the girl's house and in a car in a parking lot.

The girl said they had sex as many as 40 times, whereas Jones claimed they had sex about 20 times.

Their affair eventually came to an end in October 2012 when workers checking a fire extinguisher in the auditorium stumbled across the couple.

Jones had shouted that he was sleeping and the girl hid in a separate room - but the fire extinguisher the workers were checking was in this room.

Jones testified that he had not pursued the girl, saying: 'It's not something I went after, it's something we did together.'

Jones
 had pleaded no contest to two counts of sexual activity with a person 
under 18. He had faced up to 30 years in prison.
