A Minnesota woman has become the latest adoptee to take her search for her birth parents to social media.

Kim Lees has been searching for her birth mother for more than 10 years. On Wednesday, Lees took her search to Facebook, where at least two other adoptees in search of their birth parents have posted messages they hope will go viral and help in their search.

'My name is Kim. My birth date is 5-21-1970. I was born at Fairview 
Hospital in Minneapolis, MN,' Lees Facebook post reads. 'I am searching for my birth mother. PLEASE 
share this post. Any information can be sent to kimssearch521@gmail.com.
 Thank you!'

Help: Kim Lee hopes this image will be seen by her birth mother so the two can be reunited

So far, Lees' post has been shared 2,400 times.

Less says she was inspired by a recent mother-daughter reunion, presumably referring to Katheryn Deprill, the 27-year-old Pennsylvania who posted a similar message on Facebook in hopes of tracking down her birth mother.

Deprill's adoption story is slightly more memorable than most - she was referred to as the 'Burger King Baby' in local media accounts after her birth mother left the newborn Deprill wrapped in a shirt crying on the floor of a Burger King bathroom in 1986.

Deprill began her quest March 2 by 
posting on her Facebook page a photo in which she held up a sign that 
said: 'Looking for my birth mother. ... She abandoned me in the Burger 
King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by 
sharing my post.'

The photo 
was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, 
and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets.

Inspiration: Katheryn Deprill - dubbed 'Burger king Baby' in the media - was reunited with her birth mother after posting this on Facebook in March

That caught the 
attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came 
forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet.

Deprill said she bears a very strong resemblance to the woman, whose name she wouldn't disclose.

'It looked like I was looking in a mirror,' she said.

Deprill,
 an EMT and married mother of three who lives outside Allentown in South
 Whitehall Township, said she embraced her mother.

'I
 got the hug that I had wanted for the last 27 years, and that broke the
 ice,' she said. 'I asked if I could have it, and she said, "absolutely," and just held her arms open, and the rest is history.'

The pair met for about four hours and exchanged contact information. Deprill said they plan to meet again.

'We are definitely going to have a relationship,' she said.

Together: Deprill found her birth mother, Cathy Pochek, left, after launching an appeal on Facebook. Her adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, is at right

Deprill inspired a man - also from Pennsylvania - to use social media to try and find his birth mother.

David Volk 
- who was left in a New Jersey McDonald's sink when he was just hours old - 
launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the 
success of the 'Burger King baby.'

Volk, from Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, didn't even try looking for his 
mother because he had no information about her - but after Deprill posted an image on Facebook explaining that she'd been dumped in
 a Burger King 27 years ago, it took her just three weeks to find her 
mother.

Inspired, Volk decided to do the same, and has now shared an image on his Facebook profile showing him holding a sign reading: 'Please help me! I am looking for my birth mother.'

'I just never thought there was any 
hope,' he told the Star-Ledger. 'Being abandoned in a McDonald's, no records. After 
seeing [Deprill's] story, and she found her mom so quickly, that's what gave me 
the inspiration to do mine.'

Hopeful: David Volk also has taken his search for his birth mother to social media, posting this image on Facebook in April

Volk
 still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped 
in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women's restroom in a 
McDonald's in Newark, New Jersey in December 1977.

He
 was given the name 'Christopher McDonald' because of where he was 
found, but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year 
later, records show.

Volk,
 who is now 36 and married, said he developed a close bond with his 
family and was devastated by the loss of his adoptive mother two years 
ago.

He said he isn't angry with his birth mother but simply wishes to meet her and get to know her.

Volk's search is yet to turn up his birth mother.

The night before she posted her photo on Facebook, Lees wrote a message to friends explaining how she was trying to find her birth mother.

Anyone with information about Lees' birth mother is asked to contact her at kimsearch521@gmail.com

'I will be posting a picture in the morning that I would be grateful if 
you would share. I am adopted and have tried several avenues over the 
last 10+ years to locate my birth mother and/or information leading to 
her,' she wrote in her explanation.

'I was recently inspired by a story of a mother/daughter reunion 
made possible via social media, so I figured it is worth a shot. 
Honestly, I myself gloss over many of these posted "please share" 
pictures, but I am hoping you all would take a minute to seek it out and
 share. It is my birthday today, and this would truly be the best gift I
 could receive. I hold no preconceived notions of how this will turn out- good, bad, or no response at all, I will take it as it comes. Thank you in advance!'
