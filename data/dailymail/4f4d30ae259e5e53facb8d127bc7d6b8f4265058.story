Like any other new mother, Veronica Smith, from East Sussex, fell in love with her daughter, Catherine, the second she was laid in her arms.

But her happiness was not to last because Veronica, then 24, was an unmarried mother brought up in a Catholic family in an era that frowned on unwed parents.

Now 73, Veronica says the experience of being forced to give up her only child still haunts her and says her daughter, with whom she now has a good relationship, has suffered because of it.

Softly spoken and with unlined skin that belies her years, the mother-of-one says she hopes that the British Government will follow the example of Australia and offer an apology to women whose children were taken away and adopted by others in the 1960s.

'I, and thousands of women like me, were coerced into giving up our children,’ she says. ‘I was a perfectly healthy, capable adult. I’m still angry that my child was taken away.’

Veronica, then in her early 20s, was working as a nurse in a Butlin's holiday camp in Bognor Regis when she became pregnant after a brief fling with a 'red coat'.

When she realised she was going to have a child, the convent-educated middle class girl, was horrified.

'It was a big thing to deal with because there was a real stigma about unmarried mothers at the time. I 
just knew I had a situation that needed to be dealt with.'

Although she eventually plucked up the courage to tell her mother and sister of her plight, her father was never told and her mother went to extraordinary lengths to hide the pregnancy from him.

 'It was a big thing to deal with because there was a real stigma about unmarried mothers at the time. I 
just knew I had a situation that needed to be dealt with.'

Like Philomena Lee, the Irish mother whose tale became a BAFTA-winning silver screen success, Veronica was sent to a Catholic hostel to wait out her pregnancy.

'I told my mother and my elder sister about my situation and they gave me me a solution which was to go to a Catholic Crusade of Rescue hostel,' she remembers.

'I was a trained nurse, how could I not 
think for myself? But I was brought up to be an obedient Catholic.'

When the time came for Veronica to give birth, her mother and sister were once more by her side, although she admits that many of her memories of that traumatic time have been blocked out.

'I have a memory of the labour and 
delivery,' she says. 'I can vaguely remember birthing her and I can remember my mother 
and younger sister taking her to be baptised.'

Of the day her daughter was taken away, between five and seven days after she was born, Veronica has no memory at all.

But although she can't remember much about the adoption process itself, Veronica was never able to forget her daughter, despite repeatedly being told to 'move on' with her life.

'I was told on numerous occasions to go home, forget about it and carry on with my life,' she remembers. 'As for my mother, she just wanted it all to be over.'

While it might have been over for her mother, for Veronica, it wasn't quite so easy and she admits that the experience has had a lasting impact on her ability to form relationships.

Worse, it meant that Veronica never had the chance to have more children, meeting and marrying husband Roger in her 60s.

By the time she reached her late 40s, Veronica on the verge of a breakdown and when she suffered a series gynaecological problems, the grief she had hidden for so long came tumbling out.

Signed off work, she watched programmes such as Killroy and noted with interest their success in reuniting adopted children with their biological parents.

Inspired by what she saw, she began looking for her daughter in earnest. 'The Catholic Children's Society gave me a
 few clues about her parents whereabouts and told me they'd emigrated to
 Canada,' she remembers.

'Once you start on the searching mode, it almost becomes 
obsessive.'

Sure enough, in 1989, Veronica finally made contact with her long-lost daughter, by then a 24-year-old woman.

At first, the relationship was shaky but that all changed when Veronica's daughter Catherine gave birth to a daughter of her own.

'She was glad I made contact,' remembers Veronica of the first time she reached out to her daughter.

'She told me she had my brown eyes and my smile but she said she wasn't quite ready to meet me and that she wanted to get on with her life.

 'I've never had the chance to be a 
mother so I don't know whether or not we have a normal relationship. I 
just try to do my best.'

'She told me she didn't want anything 
further than knowing where I was.'

After Catherine had a daughter, now 11, things changed once more. 'When her daughter was nine months old, she emailed me and told me she had a daughter,' remembers Veronica, 'but it was another year before we met.'

When mother and daughter finally were reunited, Veronica says the meeting was 'fantastic' from the start.

'Oh God, it was fantastic!' she remembers. 'She [Catherine] parked on our driveway and got out and gave me 
hug and we had a lovely day.

She adds: 'She's coming today to spend the weekend with us.'

But although Veronica says the pair now have a lovely relationship, she admits that not everything has been so easy - among them, playing the role of mother to Catherine.

'That's
 the thing I find difficult - playing the mother role,' she says. 'I've never had the chance to be a mother so I don't know whether or not we have a normal relationship. I just try to do my best.'

Unethical: Some of the children put up for adoption by the Adoption Association in the 1960s

And although in regular contact with Catherine, Veronica, who was unable to have other children, says she would like an official apology to compensate for some of the pain she went through.

She also says that she has been unable to forgive the Catholic church for its stance on unmarried mothers and has since left the religion.

'The
 Philomena film has done us a lot of good,' she adds, 'and she was so forgiving of her religion, but I'm not of that mindset.

'It was going on in the whole of the UK and all round the world. Just
 because women weren't married, they lost their children. I find it 
abhorrent.'

She hopes too, that women who have lived with the guilt of giving up their children in the 1960s will hear of her story and come to accept that the situation was not of their making.

'Hopefully, the more I talk about what happened, the 
more women will come out of their closet and stop feeling ashamed and guilty,' she says.

'They're not to blame. Many of them slept with a man just once and got 
pregnant and they've paid the price for it ever since.'

Philomena is out on Blu-ray and DVD on 24th March, and available on Digital HD now. To support Veronica and women like her in their battle for an official apology, see movementforanadoptionapology.org.
