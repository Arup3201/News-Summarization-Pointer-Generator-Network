This adorable English lop-eared rabbit is keeping his enormous ears open for any news that spring might be on its way.

Photographer John Daniels, who has worked with animals for decades, photographed the rabbit as part of a special spring-themed photo shoot with newborn animals

The 59-year-old from Dunsfold, Surrey uses studio space and some unusual pairings to create the cute images.

Mr Daniels puts different animals together and cajoles them to pose as if they were a mother and young of the same species.

He said: ‘I use the studio 
because I can't rely on the British weather. I've had to cancel shoots 
in the past, so using the studio and building a set means it's one less 
thing to worry about.

‘Photographing
any animal can be tricky and with shoots outside there is more chance 
of the animal escaping or being frightened by the big outdoors.

‘I
have very good animal handlers that I use, they have lots of contacts 
in the animal world and tell me what's available at any time.

‘The hardest part is timing, I have to 
get each animal at the right age, so hatching eggs to coincide with 
kittens or puppies can take a bit of planning.

John Daniels said he never forces animals to anything because it would be clear they are unhappy in the photo

Mr Daniels has developed techniques to help the animals settle for the photo shoots.

He said: ‘I've found that the older the animal 
is the harder it is to get it to sit with another, when they are very 
young they don't really know what's going on.

‘For example a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy.

Man's best friend: Younger animals are easier to put together and are happy to be photographed side by side

‘I never force an animal to do anything, if they don't look happy it won't look good in the picture so I try something else.

‘Without
giving away any trade secrets, I use sounds to attract them, they have 
to be soft for kittens but a little louder for puppies and others.

‘Or a strange noise tends to get them to look at the camera.

He added: ‘All the animals react in different ways, so it's quite often trial and error.

‘I love working with any animal, wild or domestic, it's a privilege to be able to and I hope they enjoy working with me.

‘Many of the animals come back to the studio for several shoots and they do seem to remember what to do, little treats always help too.’
