Trading blows and brawling in the grass, two brown bear cubs go paw-to-paw in a play fight - leaving their other sibling to play the role of referee.

As the cubs fought one another in the enclosure at Hamburg's Hagenbeck Zoo, their mother had time to fish for dinner.

The scene was captured by wildlife photographer Yosuke Tani, 33, who was positioned just ten metres away from the bears.

Mr Tani, who lives in Osaka, Japan, said: 'Bear cubs are extremely playful.

'These Kamchatka bear cub triplets were enjoying chasing, sumo wrestling, and boxing with one another, whilst their mum caught fish for their dinner. 

'After about an hour, however, they grew tired and turned to their mum for some attention and a drink.

'I really wanted to visit this zoo, since it was the first zoo to create fenceless enclosures where animals are divided from visitors not by wire or cages, but only by natural or hidden obstacles, in an almost natural environment.

'I knew that little bear cubs can be overly excited, so I didn't have to wait long for them to start playing.'

The Kamchatka brown bear is a sub species of the brown bear, and is the largest sub species in Europe and Asia.

Despite their imposing size, these bears are generally not dangerous to humans, and only one per cent of encounters result in an attack.
