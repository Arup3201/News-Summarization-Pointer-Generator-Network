Chelsea left back Filipe Luis insists he wants to stay at the club despite the lack of first team opportunities and the lure of Atletico Madrid and former boss Diego Simeone.

The Brazilian defender enjoyed four years at the Vicente Calderon working under 'El Cholo' and has been linked with a return having found it tough to break in to Jose Mourinho's starting line-up.

But Luis wishes to see out his three-year contract with the Blues, and is intent on winning more silverware after the Capital One Cup success.

He told Marca: 'I'm just focused on Chelsea, on working hard and giving my best in order to end the season with another important and beautiful trophy.

'Of course, everything can change in football, but I'm happy and have a three-year contract at Chelsea that I'd like to see out.

'I've had some of the best years of my career at Atlético and remember the supporters, my teammates and the coaching staff fondly

'I'm really fond of 'El Cholo' (Simeone), he's a coach that taught me so much'.

Luis is currently away on international duty with Brazil, preparing for friendlies against France (Thursday) and Chile (Sunday).
