A Swedish artist has caused outrage after exhibiting artwork which he claims to have painted using ashes gathered in the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp.

Carl Michael von Hausswolff stole the ashes from Majdanek concentration camp in Poland during a 1989 trip and over two decades later, mixed it with water and used it as paint.

He has now been reported to the police for desecrating the remains of Majdanek’s Holocaust victims, under Swedish burial protection laws.

Outrage: Carl Michael von Hausswolff has painted a picture using ashes which he claims to have taken from the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland

Mr von Hausswolff visited Poland in 1989 to exhibit his art at a gallery not far from Lublin, a town near Majdanek. He says he was ‘gathering material for the exhibition’ when he visited the concentration camp.

‘I gathered some ashes from one of the cremation ovens, but did not use it for the exhibition – the material was too charged with the cruelties which had taken place.’

Not until 2010 did the artist decide to ‘do something’ with the ashes he had stolen from Majdanek and used it as paint by mixing it with water.

The exhibited result has enraged art critics and provoked public outcry over the use of human remains as art.

Author and translator Salomon Schulman called the artwork ‘nauseating, obsessed necrophilia’.

With what he calls ‘posthumous disgust’, Mr Schulman asks: ‘Some of the ashes may be from one of my relatives? Maybe even a brother of my flesh?’

‘It is repulsive beyond the extreme’, he told Swedish television.

Local police received a complaint from a member of the public who said the painting breaks the Swedish law protecting buried human remains.

‘It is a strange complaint which we will investigate,’ detective Stephan Söderholm said.

Majdanek was a concentration and extermination camp in Lublin, south-west Poland.

It was originally built by the Nazis in 1941 as a forced labour camp for up to 50,000 prisoners, a number which was extended to 250,000 before its completion.

According to the Majdanek museum, the gas chambers began operation in September 1942.

An estimated 79,000 people died at Majdanek, 59,000 of which were Jews.

Due to the speed of the Red Army, the Nazi’s did not have time to destroy the camps and it was nearly intact upon its liberation on July 22, 1944.

It is the best preserved Holocaust concentration camp and today functions as a museum.

‘The original crime may have been committed in Poland, but the question is if a crime has been committed in Sweden’

The painting is included in an exhibition currently on display at a gallery in the southern Swedish city of Lund.

His exhibition entitled ‘Memory works’ at Martin Bryder Gallery also includes a photograph taken at the location of the ruins of Hermann Göring’s hunting cabin.

The owner of the gallery, Martin Bryder, told state television SVT that he had no intention to cause upset.

‘This exhibition raises a lot of questions, and I think people should make up their own mind by visiting and asking the questions. That is all I have to say about it.’

‘I do not want attention for the sake of attention. This is not meant to open up old wounds, but to heal them.’

Majdanek Concentration camp museum condemns the painting as an ‘inconceivable barbaric action.’

‘It may be just an artistic act of provocation. However it is clear that the Swedish artist did not obtain the ashes legally,’ they said in a statement.

‘We hope that authorities will be able to clarify whether the remains of Majdanek victims have been stolen and desecreted.’

Carl Michael von Hausswolff, has yet to comment and has not responded to queries into the authenticity of the ashes.
