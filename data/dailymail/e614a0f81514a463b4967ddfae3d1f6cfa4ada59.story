An elderly couple were shocked to find that a battered bowl their cat used for a bed was actually a Ming dynasty antique worth a fortune. 

The owners, from Essex, put the ceramic piece up for sale because they were moving house, and were told by auctioneers to expect around £200.

However, the scratched and chipped 'bed', which had been in their family for 114 years, was sold for £108,000 to a mystery bidder.

This Ming Dynasty bowl - used as a bed by a couple's cat - has sold for £108,000

The elderly pair decided to sell the ceramic piece because they are moving house

The bowl was among a collection of antiques brought back to Britain from China in 1900 by one of the owners' great-grandfather, Major General John Tulloch.

Over the years, the owners donated most of their ceramics to museums and only kept pieces that had been damaged.

They decided to sell their last nine remaining items at auction because they are moving house.

Online punters from around the world joined 15 bidders, including some from China,  for the frantic bidding war for the moggy's makeshift bed.

The detail on the bowl shows it could be from 15th century - during the Ming Dynasty

Auctioneers gave the chipped 'Ming-style' bowl a £200 estimate but were overwhelmed by the amount of interest in it from Chinese bidders. 

It sold for £90,000 - or £108,000 including fees - suggesting the bowl is authentic and dates back to the Imperial Ming dynasty, which ran from 1368 to 1644.

An 11in, 19th century tall vase with a damaged lid also sold for nearly £40,000. 

And a scratched yellow saucer dish with a hairline crack fetched more than £11,000. 

The lots had been passed down through the owners' family for 114 years

James Grinter, from Reeman Dansie Auctioneers, said: 'There were about a dozen items from the same family. They were all in a bit of a state but they all did very well.

'The owners' cat used to sleep in the Ming bowl on top of a chest of drawers in the hallway of their house.

'It had a few chips in and had a staple repair - it was quite obvious damage to look at.

'We described it as Ming-style because it was hard to date and put a low estimate of £200 to £300 on it. 

The couple sold a number of other antiques - including a saucer which fetched more than £11,000

'But there was huge interest in it. I couldn't keep up with the bidding that was coming from online as well as 15 bidders in the room.

'I think the reason it did so well is because all of the lots had a cast-iron provenance.

'One of the owners' great-grandfather, who was a Major General in the Indian Army, acquired most of it while he was in China in 1900 and brought it back to England with him.

'It has all been passed down through the family. The lots that sold are the last pieces of the collection.'
