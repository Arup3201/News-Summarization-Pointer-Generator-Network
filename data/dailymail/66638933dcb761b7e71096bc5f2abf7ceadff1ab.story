The California drought has had a catastrophic impact on the state's economy, with businesses forced to close and families made to relocate. 

And one of the industries that has been hit the hardest by the shortage in rain and snowfall - is skiing.

Many Lake Tahoe resorts have been forced to close, while others have been left with dried-up runs.

Skiers and snowboarders were captured threading their way through patches of dirt at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the Olympic Valley.

The striking images were captured after two more resorts announced they were closing.

Sierra-at-Tahoe said they would temporarily shut due to a lack of snow, but Truckee's Sugar Bowl Resort revealed they are closing for the season on Sunday. 

Homewood, Soda Springs and Tahoe Donner have already had to turn winter sports fans away.
