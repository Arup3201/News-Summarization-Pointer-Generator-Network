Legend: Nolan Miller, the 79-year-old designer behind the Eighties show Dynasty, passed away on Wednesday after a long battle with lung cancer

Nolan Miller, whose over-the-top costumes on Dynasty defined Eighties fashion, has died.

The designer, who was 79, passed away in his sleep on Wednesday at his home in Woodland Hills, California, following a six-year battle with lung cancer.

His death was confirmed yesterday by longtime friend Joan Collins.

The actress told her Twitter 
followers: 'My dear friend Nolan Miller died peacefully in his sleep 
last night. He was a huge part of my life and I will miss him terribly. 
Rest now NM.'

Miller's lavish creations, including the extravagant-shouldered gowns 
often seen on Dynasty's female stars, won him an Emmy in 1984 and six 
nominations.

He began designing costumes for the show in 1981 and the series ended in 1989.

The sequined gowns, fur stoles and wide-brimmed hats he created for Joan Collins' character Alexis Carrington Colby became some of the era's most iconic style pieces.

It certainly inspired the thick shoulder pad trend which proved prevalent during the Eighties.

According to the New York Times, his weekly wardrobe budget was $35,000 and he created more than 30,000 costumes over the years.

The Texas-born designer once said: 'I never want to see them wearing the same outfit twice.'

As a friend of the late Aaron 
Spelling and Douglas S. Cramer, who worked as executive producers on Dynasty, Mr Miller also worked on further projects with the pair.

His designs featured in Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat and Green Acres as well as more than 40 feature films.

He designed Morticia's famous long black gown in the Addams Family.

A beige dress of his that was encrusted with silver beads was seen on Gilligan's Island, worn by Ginger who was played by Tina Louise.

Razzle dazzle: The designer began creating costumes for the show (above l-r: Joan Collins, John Forsythe, Linda Evans) in 1981 and received six Emmy nominations for his work. He won an Emmy award in 1984

Mr Cramer told the paper: 'It was Nolan's real vision of not just the clothes, but of the surroundings and milieu that were so important... I always referred to him as Aaron's secret weapon.'

'Everything matches; the suit, the hats, the gloves, the jewellery'

The designer once said: 'Everything matches; the suit, the hats, the gloves, the jewellery. When she walks down the hall, you may not know who she is, but 
you know she's rich, and you know you better get out of the way.'

His on-screen designs were so successful that he launched his own collection of men's suits in 1987 within the Leslie Fay Company.

After the Leslie Fay company went bankrupt in 1995, he began manufacturing his own work but the venture did not last long - he closed his business one and a half years later.

But even after its closure, Miller was determined to create designs for the mass market.

Talented: He also created Morticia Addams' famous black gown (left) which was worn by the late actress Carolyn Jones in the series, as well as many costumes from Charlie's Angels (right)

He developed a costume jewellery line during the late Eighties which was sold on QVC, the home shopping network, up until last year.

He even gave the suit business another go and signed a deal with the Morgan Miller brand which gave him his own line of suits.

The designer was also said to be enamored by Hollywood's leading screen starlets.

Bob Mackie, a costume designer who was friends with Miller, said: 'He very much loved that Hollywood lady. I would say three or four times a week, he would be seen with an actress on his arm wearing his dress.'

Fancy: His creations, seen above, sparked the huge Eighties fashion trend of wearing thick shoulder pads

He married Sandra Stream Miller, his now deceased ex-wife in 1980 after meeting her through her daughter who he had designed a debutante gown for.

The pair divorced in 1993.

No other immediate family members of Miller's survive.

He had been living at the Motion Picture And Television Country House And Hospital.
