Winner: Timothy Poole, a registered sex offender, won $3million from a scratch-off ticket

The lawsuit was filed by two brothers, who were ages 9 and 5 when Poole was arrested.

In 2010, the Legislature eliminated a statute of limitations for victims of sexual battery younger than 16.

Poole pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery in 1999 after a 9-year-old boy claimed he was molested by the man in his bed

Poole, a driver and dispatcher for his mother's cab company, Triangle Cab, is a registered sex offender. 

In 1999, Poole was arrested following allegations that he sexually abused a 9-year-old boy.

According to WKMG, Poole was accused of sleeping in the same bed as the boy and waking him up while he was sleeping to perform sex acts.

He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery after accepting a plea bargain and being required to serve ten years of sex offender probation.

Four years later, in 2003, he has his probation revoked and was sent to prison for three years after he missed four of his required group sessions.

Poole maintains that he is innocent.

'It may be hard for some to believe, but sometimes people are wrongly accused,' he said. 

'I've known him for years and I've never seen any inclination of anything like that with him,' said his friend Floyd Snyder.

'He's a very positive person. Very kind. Giving. I think that's why he won. It's Christmastime and the dude deserves a break.' 

It is not illegal for convicted sex offenders to play or win the lottery in the state of Florida.

As for what Poole plans to do with the money, it is being reported that he is looking to help his mother expand her cab company.
