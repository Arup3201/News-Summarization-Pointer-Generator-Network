The consultant who treated Tony Blair’s heart ‘flutter’ is pioneering a same-day method to detect and treat similar cardiac problems. A ‘heart detective’ system is being used to root out the cause of disorders that make the heart beat too slowly, too fast or out of sync.

Called the rhythmia mapping system, the technique involves a probe being threaded up into the heart via a small incision in the groin.

The probe, which looks like a miniature egg whisk, brushes the surface of the heart, with electrodes picking up problem tissue in just 15 minutes.

 

This tissue is then burned away under local anaesthetic and normal rhythm is restored, meaning patients may be able to go home the same day.

Consultant cardiologist Wyn Davies, who treated the former Prime Minister for an abnormal heart rhythm in 2004, is one of the first in Europe to use the device, caring for patients at London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. It is also being used at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.

Mr Davies says the treatment is a breakthrough for hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from complex rhythm conditions, which can trigger strokes – or even sudden death.

‘These abnormal rhythms have a major impact on people’s lives and survival,’ he says. ‘The advantage of this system is that it “maps” the heart’s electrical activity more accurately and more quickly.’

A ‘normal’ heart beats between 60 and 100 times a minute when resting. But for people with atrial fibrillation (AF) – the most common of abnormal heart rhythm conditions – it can beat 140 times a minute.

This is because electrical impulses start firing off randomly in the upper chambers of the heart, causing it beat out of rhythm.

Mr Blair is one of an estimated 800,000 Britons to be diagnosed with the condition, which can cause breathlessness, dizziness and palpitations. He underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation, known as a catheter ablation, to correct his irregular heartbeat in October 2004.

With AF, blood can pool and clots can form inside the heart, which, if left untreated, can make the patient five times more likely to suffer a stroke.

Similarly, actor Brian Blessed blamed his recent collapse on stage on an irregular heart rhythm condition. The 78-year-old, who underwent a heart procedure three years ago, said he had suffered a ‘little fibrillation’ after fainting and falling during a performance of Shakespeare’s King Lear. He has since pulled out of further performances due to ongoing problems.

Other rhythm conditions the new procedure could help include ventricular tachycardia, a rapid heartbeat caused by a malfunction in one of the heart’s ventricles.

Serious cases of this can lead to a cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating, which in turn stops oxygen-rich blood reaching the brain and other vital organs.

The recognised treatment for heart-rhythm disorders is to burn away the tissue responsible for the problem, yet the challenge for doctors is to identify the exact spot.

Until now, they have used tubes with electrodes on the tips to monitor the signals and track where they are coming from. These send back pictures that can be viewed on a computer screen, but the images tend to be flat and difficult to make out.

Hope: Consultant cardiologist Wyn Davies believes the new treatment method is a major breakthrough

In comparison, the ‘heart detective’ system, which has been a decade in the making, is far more sophisticated. After being threaded up through a 2mm incision in the groin, the whisk-shaped probe inflates to the size of a lime once it reaches the surface of the heart, and begins to monitor the electric signals.

The probe is fitted with dozens of electrodes that capture 20,000 pieces of data in 15 minutes, compared with only 500 in half an hour with a conventional device.

This data allows doctors to build a detailed 3D image of the heart on a computer to identify the precise section of muscle causing the problem. The rogue tissue can then be destroyed in a separate procedure immediately after doctors have ‘mapped’ the heart and identified the problem area.

Mr Davies said that in some cases, patients can be treated under local anaesthetic, meaning that a longer hospital stay is no longer necessary.

‘The new technology locates the source of abnormal accelerated heart rhythms, guiding their elimination and then confirming successful treatment,’ Mr Davies adds.

‘We expect to be able to reduce procedure times significantly and to provide more accurate and detailed information than we could before.’

Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, believes the ‘heart detective’ shows real promise to speed up diagnosis of problems and treatment times.

He says: ‘By allowing the cardiologist to diagnose more quickly and more accurately exactly where to block the source of heart-rhythm disturbance, patients may have better outcomes. We look forward to seeing it tested in larger numbers of patients.’
