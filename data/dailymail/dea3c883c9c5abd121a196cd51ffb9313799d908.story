Souleymane Doukara netted twice to provide Leeds head coach Dave Hockaday with a first victory – but it might not be enough to keep him in the side for the weekend.

The 22-year-old French forward, borrowed from Italian side Catania, struck twice in the first half to give the Yorkshire club breathing space against their League Two opponents.

And they needed it as Accrington roared back following Doukara's substitution to a standing ovation late on.

James Gray poked in to halve the deficit and Leeds lived on their nerves after Gaetano Berardi was red-carded for a wild challenge on Stanley substitute Rob Atkinson.

After securing progress to the second round of the Capital One Cup, Hockaday confirmed Leeds hope to complete a trio of deals – Southampton striker Billy Sharp and Chesterfield centre-back Liam Cooper joining permanently, and another Catania player Giuseppe Bellusci on a season-long loan – on Wednesday.

'If they pass their medicals and sign contracts then we can discuss them,' he said, cautiously.

'But we have been really close to some signings and they have fallen through for whatever reason so I don't want to talk about people until they are my players.'

Doukara eased United into a 2-0 interval lead with a couple of classy strikes. First, he controlled Swiss international Berardi's low cross to fire in from the edge of the box. Then, latching onto academy product Lewis Cook's teasing through ball, he switched the ball to his left foot to curl in the second on the run seven minutes before the break.

'He didn't do himself justice on Saturday at Millwall, he was a rabbit in the headlights,' Hockaday said.

'But he looked impressive tonight. The thing about him is he's got potential and my definition of potential is that you haven't done anything yet.'

James Beattie's Accrington re-emerged with greater purpose, and an altered formation, at the start of the second period and went close just four minutes when James Gray's header looped over.

But he did find the net with his next effort as he poked in from close range late six minutes from time.

When Berardi departed for his reckless tackle, silence enveloped Elland Road but Leeds ran down the clock to ensure Hockaday's first win since replacing Brian McDermott at the helm.

'I am happy we are in the next round, that's what this was all about and we have achieved it,' Hockaday added.

'In the first half we showed glimpses of our potential but the second half was a reality check that we are a work in progress.'
