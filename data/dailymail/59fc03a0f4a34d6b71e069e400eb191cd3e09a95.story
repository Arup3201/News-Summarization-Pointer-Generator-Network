A small family-run brewery in Sydney will continue to sell beer under its current name after winning a two-year trademark battle against multi-billion dollar beer company, SABMiller.

The global company tried to stop the Sydney-based  brewery from selling its craft ale back in 2012 when owner Peter Philip tried to register the Wayward Brewing name.

Executives from SABMiller India thought the name was too similar to its Indian brewed Haywards 2000 and Haywards 5000 beer.

But an Australian Trade Marks hearing ruled in favour of Wayward Brewing this week and agreed with Mr Philip's argument that the Indian beer was virtually unknown in Australia, according to The Daily Telegraph.

'Maybe they thought that a little guy wouldn't stand up to them, but I always knew we were in the right and I wasn't going to give up without a fight,' Mr Philip said.

'For me it was always personal as I have put my heart and soul into building this business.'

SABMiller cited 14 different reasons why the Wayward brand should not be trademarked, including the fact it could have traded off the popularity of the Indian beer.

The Trade Marks Office, however, said Haywards only accounted for less than 0.006 percent of the total Australia beer market in 2011-12.

The global company was ordered to pick up the legal bill for the Wayward Brewing.

Despite the win, Mr Philip said the case had put him about of pocket by about $20,000.

'It is a great feeling to be finally vindicated in our victory but it has cost us a lot of time, money and stress wondering whether this massive global brewer was going to force us to change our brand and start all over with a new name,' he said.

Up until now, Wayward had been what was known as a 'Gypsy Brewery', meaning they utilised equipment from other breweries around Sydney.

But the company recently secured premises in the inner western suburb of Camperdown where it will start brewing from in early 2015.
