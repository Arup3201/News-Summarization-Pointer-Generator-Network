Amazon is set to take on the likes of Sky, BT and Netflix with the launch of a new paid-for TV package.

Technically, the service isn't brand new - instead Amazon is rebranding its LoveFilm Instant streaming service as Prime Instant Video.

This service will be combined with the retailer's current Prime delivery service, as well as access to Amazon's Kindle library, for £79 a year.

From Wednesday, viewers in the UK will be able to subscribe to Prime Instant Video, pictured. The service combines LoveFilm TV streaming, Prime delivery service and access to the Kindle library - for £79 a year. The price is 35 per cent cheaper than if LoveFilm and the next-day delivery service were bought separately

LoveFilm Instant currently costs £5.99 a month - or £71.88 a year - and offers online streaming of thousands of titles across games consoles, mobile devices and computers.

To add DVD rentals to this package increases the subscription price to £7.99 a month.

Amazon Prime costs £49 a year for unlimited one-day delivery on millions of items as well as thousands of free Kindle downloads.

By combining the two, customers will save £41.88 a year, but customers who currently don't use, and don't want to use Prime, will be paying an extra £7.12 a year.

This also means that people who only want to use the Prime delivery service will also have to pay an extra £30 , when the time comes to renew, for a streaming service they don't necessarily want. 

The LoveFilm by Post service will not be affected.

Amazon completed its acquisition of LoveFilm in 2011 and has been offering the Instant streaming service alongside LoveFilm's DVD rentals ever since.

LoveFilm Instant currently costs £5.99 a month - or £71.88 a year - and offers online streaming of thousands of titles across games consoles, mobile devices and computers.

The LoveFilm by Post service will not be affected.

Prime Instant Video was launched in the U.S in 2011 and costs $79 a month. The service is now being extended to Germany and the UK next Wednesday. 

As well as importing the streaming package to the UK, Amazon also plans to invest millions in creating its own programmes in a bid to challenge mainstream broadcasters and rival Netflix, which has had huge success with its series House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey.

In the meantime though, Prime Instant Video will offer the same titles as LoveFilm Instant currently offers. Viewers will be able to rent or buy 
films and TV shows, including The Walking Dead and Vikings, on devices 
including iPads, Kindle Fire, Xbox and smart TVs.

By comparison, Netflix, pictured, charges £5.99 a month for unlimited streaming, while Wuaki.tv costs £4.99 for streaming and purchases but has a smaller selection to choose from

Tim
 Leslie, Vice President of Amazon Instant Video for the UK and Germany, 
said: 'We’ve worked hard to offer the best selection of TV shows and 
movies for Prime Instant Video.

‘We
 also added high definition video and introduced apps for popular 
devices like Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Samsung and Sony TVs and iPads and
 iPhones.'

Greg
 Greeley, vice president of Amazon Prime, added: ‘Millions of customers 
in the US have streaming video included as part of their Prime 
membership and they tell us they love the combination of unlimited 
delivery, the ability to borrow Kindle books, and access to thousands of
 movies, TV shows and exclusive videos.

‘We are delighted to be bringing that same combination of services to the UK, providing members truly unique benefits they can enjoy every day of the year.’

Amazon’s share price tumbled more than 9 per cent last month, after profits of $239million (£143.5million) for the Christmas period failed to meet expectations.
