A former army corporal received a royal salute from Prince Charles today as he continued his 11,000 mile mobility scooter journey around the UK in aide of his former comrades.

Mark Newton, who suffered a life changing injury to his leg in 1991 whilst attached to the United Nations in Cyprus, passed the prince while he inspected the troops before sending them on their way to march through Swansea.

The Prince of Wales holds the honorary role of Colonel-in-Chief with the 1st Queens Dragoons Guards who Mr Newton used to serve for, and who part funded his scooter.

Former army corporal Mark Newton received a royal salute from Prince Charles in Swansea today as he continued on his 11,000 mile mobility scooter journey around the UK to raise money for his former comrades.

 Mr Newton's UK tour is his second fundraising trip. After being made redundant in 2010, he drove 1,450 miles around Wales in 2011, raising just under £9,000 for his former unit, Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion. 

The 48-year-old from Loughor, began his latest trip, along with his two cats Missy and Smudge, from Scotland in April last year. According to a fundraising page, he has so far raised over £39,000. 

In August he spoke to Wales Online and was reportedly on day 494 of his trip. It is not known how Mr Newton's trip will take, but his scooter has a top speed of eight miles an hour, so if he travelled at its top speed for eight hours a day for a week, he would cover just under 450 miles. His 1,452 mile trip in 2011, took 52 days.  

The prince's appearance in Swansea was one of two engagements he was involved in during a pre-Christmas tour of the principality - which also saw him reopen the refurbished Memorial Hall in Newbridge, Caerphilly. 

Dozens of military personnel marched in time to the Royal Armoured Corps band - exercising their right to Freedom of the City - as Charles saluted them.

QDG General Sir Simon Mayall said the event was special for the regiment - who have completed three tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq - as well as Wales.

He said: 'We were given the freedom of Swansea in 2009 and this the second time we have exercised that right.

'The Queens Dragoons Guards have long had strong links with Wales - hence our nickname as the Welsh Cavalry.

'So to carry out the march, with our Colonel-in-Chief the Prince of Wales watching is truly special.'

The Prince was only in Wales some six months ago for his annual 'summer holiday' in Wales - which sees the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall stay at their 192 acre Llwynywermod estate near Llandovery, as well undertaking a series of engagements across the country.

But despite making regular visits, the crowds still turned out in force.

Around 100 people braved exceptionally chilly temperatures and blustery winds to welcome the Prince to Newbridge Memorial Hall for his first engagement.

The Prince's visit to the hall was been described as the icing on the cake by local officials following its lengthy restoration. 

The Grade II listed building, built in 1908, has been brought back into use thanks to the efforts of fundraisers with original decorations restored and its major rooms retaining their original uses.

As he walked down the street towards the hall youngsters from Pentremawr Primary School serenaded Charles with Christmas carols while waving Welsh and Union flags.

After chatting to several youngsters and wishing them a Merry Christmas, Charles also drew big smiles while chatting to members of a local toddler group. 

The Prince of Wales also visited The Newbridge Memorial Hall in South Wales to officially open the refurbished building; above he meets a member of the pre school club

After looking at Roy Guy's painting commemorating the 1878 Abercarn mining disaster, which killed 268, the prince was treated to more music from the talents of Newbridge & District Ladies Choir.

As well as watching ballroom dancers strut their stuff, Charles watched a specially written comedy sketch - aptly called Waiting For Charles.

Later he addressed a packed 400-seater auditorium, before unveiling a memorial plaque, commemorating the lives of miners.

Charles said: 'Of course I said I must come back to see this special building transformed once again, especially at the time of the centenary of the First World War - a most suitable moment.

'I know how challenging these projects can be so I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all those people who took part to get this splendid building back up again.

'I do hope this place will bring new life and inspiration to Newbridge.'

Howard Stone, chair of the Newbridge Institute & Memorial Hall, said it was an incredible day for everyone connected with the venue.

He added: 'We have fought long and hard for this and to share the celebrations with Prince Charles and our 400 guests is the perfect way to mark this wonderful occasion.' 

Charles hopped aboard the Royal train at Pontypool and headed westward bound to Swansea.

And it was especially fitting the Prince's next engagement was at The Guildhall - a building opened by King George VI and the place where Charles himself signed the official papers to turn Swansea from a town into a city.
