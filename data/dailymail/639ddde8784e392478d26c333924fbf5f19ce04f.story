Everton defender Leighton Baines says the club’s expansive style of football is ‘well-suited’ to doing well in the Champions League over the next few years under manager Roberto Martinez. 

Baines will be a key figure when Everton meet Lille in the Europa League knowing victory would virtually guarantee them a place in the knockout stages. 

For the 29-year-old England left back, it is the perfect dummy run for what he expects to be bigger European campaigns to come.

‘We all want to bring that next level of football to this club,’ he said. 

‘That is the motivation and what we are all working towards. We don’t just want do well, we want to create real special memories. 

'There is no ceiling to how we are developing. We play the same style as the top teams and if we go into the Champions League it would be well-suited to that level of football. The way we play means we’d be able to compete with better opposition.’ 

Baines has been in top form after a move to Manchester United fell through last year when the Old Trafford club offered what Everton called a ‘derisory’ £28million for him and Marouane Fellaini. He signed a new four-year deal at the start of 2014 and his next Premier League assist will equal Graeme Le Saux’s record for a defender (44). 

‘I’ve found it quite easy to keep moving forward,’ he added. 

'I’ve stayed and younger players like Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley and John Stones have all signed long-term contracts. It is a real sign of where the club is.’ 

Martinez also insists players such as Barkley won’t be sold. 

‘We are on a very strong footing financially and any decisions made about players will be based around football. Being in Europe helps with that,’ the Spaniard confirmed.

Everton may have to watch out for in-form striker Divock Origi when they face Lille at Goodison park

So far, Everton have produced a fine Europa League campaign, beating Wolfsburg at home and drawing away to Krasnodar and Lille to top their group. 

Winning the competition guarantees entry into next season’s Champions League, which may be more realistic than a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League. 

Their main concern will be Lille’s £10million striker Divock Origi — on loan from Liverpool — and 36-year-old defender Sylvain Distin could be drafted in to stop him after Antolin Alcaraz suffered a shoulder injury on Saturday.
