Lionel Messi is on his verge of scoring his 400th goal for both club and country when Barcelona face Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.

Despite being only 27-years-old, the phenomenal forward has already amassed 398 goals - with Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo claiming with 'On Saturday against Athletic he can reach a figure only within reach of a genius'.

Messi has scored 356 goals for Barcelona  and 42 for Argentina, including four in taking his country to the World Cup final where he was controversially named the best player at the tournament.

The 27-year-old missed Argentina's recent 4-2 win over Germany in a repeat of the final during last week's international friendly after picking up a groin injury in Barcelona's defeat of Villarreal - but will be it to return against Athletic.

Messi scored a brace in Barcelona's opening game against Elche to get this season's tally underway.

He has scored an incredible 245 goals in 245 league games for Barcelona alone - taking him to fourth in the list of all time scorers in La Liga.

Although a relatively quiet season by his standards saw rival Cristiano Ronaldo awarded the Ballon d'Or last term, Messi did top the ratings in the latest FIFA 15 video game with a total score of 93 out of 100.

Meanwhile, new Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has slammed the level of media scrutiny directed at those who manage superstars such as Messi, claiming the joy is taken away from coaching such talent.

Martino suggests the enormous pressure and constant questioning surrounding Messi means coaches will be criticised regardless of the talisman's performances.

The 27-year-old picked up an injury against Villarreal but is expected to return on Saturday

'When you get the chance to coach a footballer like Leo it's very difficult to be exempt from comments and rumours,' said Martino.

'In our time together at Barcelona, it was said he was saving himself for the World Cup. But in La Liga he scored about 30 goals.

'There were always questions about Leo, if he scored three goals then why had he scored three goals? If he scored one, then why had he only scored one? And if didn't score at all, it was the same.'
