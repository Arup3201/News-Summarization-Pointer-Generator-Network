A controversial scheme to get women to breastfeed in return for store vouchers amounts to ‘bribery’, critics have warned.

They say rewarding mothers who don’t rely on formula milk could penalise those who can’t physically feed their babies.

Concern was also mounting the system could be abused after it emerged that mothers taking part will not have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding – instead their compliance will be ‘taken on trust’.

Sensible use of public resources: Mothers taking part will not even have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding ¿ instead their compliance will be ¿taken on trust'

It is feared that the feasibility study, aimed at finding ways to push up the UK’s low rates of breastfeeding, would not be rigorous enough to justify the use of taxpayer funding.

Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said: ‘This just doesn’t seem like a sensible use of public resources. The reasons why women don’t breastfeed are far more complex than this gives credit for – bribing women doesn’t tackle that, it just encourages them to take the money.’

Altogether 130 women in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire taking part could earn up to £200 in vouchers for Matalan, Tesco and John Lewis. If the initial scheme is successful, it could be rolled out nationally. However, midwives and health visitors will sign off the form for rewards without actually observing the breast feeding.

Once the form-filling is complete, the mothers will receive the first vouchers in bundles of £40 over three weeks. A spokesman for Sheffield University, which is running the four-month pilot, said: ‘It is a trust relationship, but the midwife will know from conversation and working with the mum if she is breast feeding.’

Currently one in four women does not attempt to breastfeed – one of the worst rates in the world.The Department of Health is funding the project, however, Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter stressed he did not believe it was the best way forward. He said: ‘Breastfeeding has huge health benefits. But it should be a woman’s choice to breastfeed and we know not all mothers are able to.

Professor Mitch Blair, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the initiative may penalise mothers who are unable to breastfeed.

Professor Laurence Moore, Scientific Committee, National Prevention Research Initiative, said: ‘This is a feasibility study – we don’t know if it will be effective or not. It’s worth finding out whether such a novel intervention might work.’

Television presenter Kirstie Allsopp, 42, who has two sons and two stepsons, tweeted her disagreement with the idea.

She tweeted last night: ‘All day I’ve tried not to tweet about this Breast Feeding vouchers idea, and say it’s a f****** stupid bulls***idea, now I’ve failed.’
