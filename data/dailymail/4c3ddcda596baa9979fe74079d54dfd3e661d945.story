Forget the A-League, football's A-list is coming to Australia and fans will be able to get a glimpse of the world's greatest player, Cristiano Ronaldo.

An estimated $US4.2 billion worth of talent will be on display when Spanish giants Real Madrid play in a mini tournament with English champions Manchester City in Melbourne. A third team is yet to be announced. 

The International Champions Cup - backed by Nine Live and the Victorian Government - will be played in July at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on July 18, 21, and 24.

Players such as Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Iker Casillas from European Champions League winners Madrid will do battle with the likes of City superstars Joe Hart, Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany.

City could receive most of the support - they have a commercial deal with A-League side Melbourne City. 

Ronaldo, who earned a whopping $77 million in 2014, is expected to be joined by his supermodel girlfriend Irina Shayk.

At $15 million, the highest earner on Manchester City is Yaya Toure, the African Footballer of the Year for 2013.

The tournament will draw football fanatics from across the Asia-Pacific region, and it will also be broadcasted in 150 countries.

There will be three matches in the Melbourne Cricket Ground in July 2015, with the fixture list to be confirmed when the third team is announced.
