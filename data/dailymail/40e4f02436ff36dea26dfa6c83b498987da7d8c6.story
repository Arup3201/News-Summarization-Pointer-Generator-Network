Apple has patented a new method of tackling the problem of texting while driving by locking out drivers when their car is moving.

The patent reveals a system using sensors and even onboard cameras to check if a person is in the driving seat.

It even reveals a 'scenery analyser' to tell if the driver is in a safe area.

Apple's CarPlay uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features. Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers

In April last year Texas researchers found 
that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such 
as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers.

They found that both methods impacted
 driver response times equally - but that it often took voice 
recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages.

The findings were then confirmed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in 
the U.S in June.

It similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase, 
reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised.

In the run up to the CarPlay release, Apple added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software.

The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road. 

Similar apps are already available for Android devices while Microsoft’s Windows Phone comes with a specialized Drive Mode aimed at ‘reducing distractions while you’re behind the wheel’.

Apple is also believed to be mulling adding the capabilities to its iOS software, saying it would be

'a significant selling point in the eyes of concerned parents, and it could lead to legislation that would require all handheld computing devices to disable texting while driving.'

Apple announced its iOS in the car service earlier this year.

Called CarPlay, the integrated system gives drivers a 'smarter, safer and more fun way to use an iPhone in the car.'

It works by linking the car's built-in display and software with iOS 7 and Siri on the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S - and will be rolled out to compatible Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo later this week.

Once an iPhone is connected to a vehicle fitted with CarPlay, Siri can be used to access the phone’s contacts, make calls, return missed calls and listen to voicemails.

When a user receives an incoming message or notification, they can reply using voice commands.

Siri can also read the messages and let drivers dictate longer responses or emails. 

While driving, CarPlay can guess destinations by scanning the phone’s calendar for appointments, and when used with Apple Maps, Siri will give instructions, warn of any traffic incidents and keep the driver updated with the estimated time of arrival.

Drivers' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice-activated emails were played to them, in a system similar to that used in Apple's CarPlay, pictured. Talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk, but listening to voice-activated features was classed as an extensive risk

Elsewhere, CarPlay can be used to control music, podcasts and audiobooks on the car's display, pictured, or by asking Siri to pull up what they'd like to hear. CarPlay also works with select third-party apps such as Spotify and iHeartRadio

Drivers can also ask Siri for turn-by-turn directions, which are shown on the car’s built-in display.

‘CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,’ said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS Product Marketing.

‘iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimised distraction. We have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out CarPlay, and we’re thrilled it will make its debut this week.’

A leaked video, posted by app developer Steven Troughton-Smith at the end of January, hinted to what the technology would look like.

Other car makers including BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota will be shipping CarPlay-compatible cars later this year.

Google has also been in talks with car manufacturers, including Audi, to add a similar, Android-based system into cars later this year.
