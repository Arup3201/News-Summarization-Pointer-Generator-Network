Federal employees working in the Justice Department and in prisons across the country have been caught watching pornography while at work - but have escaped without punishment.

An investigation has revealed dozens of staff members misused their government computers by browsing sexually explicit content at their desks.

However they are rarely given sanctions while their names are not disclosed to the public because of their right to privacy.

An investigation has revealed that dozens of federal employees in the Justice Department and in prisons across the country have been caught viewing pornography - but have escaped punishment 

Computer logs revealed that some had looked at websites promoting foreign brides and escorts while an individual was discovered to have bought explicit 'memorabilia' from eBay. 

According to The Washington Times, an employee at the US Office of the Trustee - a part of the Justice Department who oversee the integrity of the bankruptcy system — spent up to five hours a day  looking at pornography while at work, visiting more than 2,500 adult websites during 2011.

A Freedom of Information Act request also revealed that at a prison in Oakdale, Louisiana, 13 correctional officers were found to be scouring porn sites during work hours. 

Pornography also turned up on work computers at federal prisons in Oregon and Arkansas.  

A previous investigation found that when employees were asked why they visited the sites, it was because of boredom. 

Republican Congressman Mark Meadows has put forward a bill to make it a uniform law that federal employees cannot look at adult websites while at work

Yet they are rarely penalised for the abuses of departmental regulations, according to a memo released as part of the request.

The only punishments given out are done so 'administratively', however details of what that involves was not released. 

The request also asked for the names of those who had breached the policy, but their names were redacted.  

Kevin Evans, a Colorado-based attorney, began legal proceedings to try and have the names of executives embroiled in the Securities and Exchange Commission porn scandal in 2010 disclosed, but a judge ruled against him and said that privacy interests prevailed.

'The courts are not willing to require the disclosure of names, and they assert the privacy exemption in the FOIA law, which I think has become toothless anyway,' he told the paper.

'Requiring disclosure of these cases would certainly put a dent in this kind of activity going forward,' he added. 

In May it was revealed that an Environmental Protection Agency employee was still receiving a $120,000 salary, even though he had been viewing pornography for between two and six hours every day. 

When an investigator went to interview him, he was at his desk surfing sexually explicit websites. 

It prompted Republican Congressman Mark Meadows to introduce a bill to make it a uniform federal  law that employees cannot look at pornography at work.

The North Carolina politician said many of the agencies had rules, but they were not enforced.
