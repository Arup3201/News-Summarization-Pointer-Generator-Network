Norwich manager Neil Adams has backed his squad to illustrate why they are one of the promotion favourites.

The Canaries begin life back in the Championship with a trip to Wolves - last season's League One champions - on Sunday.

Adams was handed the Carrow Road post on a permanent basis this summer which brought a mixed reaction from the fans.

However, his vow to play flowing, attacking football certainly raised his stock following many monotonous displays under previous boss Chris Hughton.

With playmaker Wes Hoolahan signing a new two-year contract this week and the summer captures of Lewis Grabban and Kyle Lafferty, goals should not be in short supply, unlike last season.

Performance: Neil Adams said Norwich's performances must live up to people's expectations this season

So far only Robert Snodgrass (Hull) and Ricky van Wolfswinkel (on loan to Saint Etienne) have departed, with Leroy Fer - who will be absent at Molineux following his World Cup exploits with Holland - still being heavily linked with a move.

Adams told the club's official website: 'We can't stop people tipping us to go back up but we have to make sure we go and perform. We have to show people we are as good as they think.

'We have to be ready to handle that along with the other two relegated teams because no one is just going to let us go back up, that is for sure. Wolves are not going to roll over and let us do what we want to do.

Disappointment: Ricky van Wolfswinkel signed for the club for close to £10m but has been loaned to St. Etienne

'We have a good core group who are capable of competing really well in this division. The key thing for us is you respect the opposition but they have to respect us equally because we are going to be positive in every game to try and get as many points and victories as possible.

'To do well in this division you need to score goals but of course that doesn't mean you throw caution to the wind and risk losing games before you have a foothold.

'You have to get the balance with the emphasis on attacking, scoring goals and dominating the ball. But you have to be ready to defend as and when because we will be tested.

'Wolves are a good side, well organised, they have a style of play and a philosophy that suits them. It will be a tough game but I am anticipating 46 tough ones.'

Wolves: Norwich's opposition on the first day of the season will be League One champions Wolves

Opposite number Kenny Jackett admits an opening-day clash with one of relegated teams from the top-flight is an ideal test for his Wolves side.

He told his club's official website: 'It is a terrific opening game, live on TV and because of what has happened to the clubs in recent seasons and now seeing where they are in this new season and what standard they are at.

'These are the games we want. We want to be in these games, testing ourselves - and we do early on. We've got some really good games.'

Jackett should have Bakary Sako (groin), Leon Clarke (back) and Jack Price (Achilles) available but will be without Tommy Rowe (fractured metatarsal).
