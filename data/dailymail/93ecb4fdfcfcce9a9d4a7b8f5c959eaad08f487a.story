Play was suspended for two hours at the US Open after severe weather took its toll over Flushing Meadows in New York.

Andy Murray is due to feature in the fourth round on Monday against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga but the match is in danger of being delayed by similar storms, which led one person in the borough of Queens to describe it as 'end-of-the-world type weather' on Sunday evening.

Murray orchestrated a 6-1, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 win over Russia's Andrey Kyznetsov on Saturday and may want to avoid weather reports, as experts  suggest there is a good chance of more heavy showers and lightning heading towards the area.

The interruption came too late for Maria Sharapova, who lost 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 to 10th-seed Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round.

Afterwards speaking to reporters whose phones were buzzing due to weather warnings, Sharapova asked: 'Is that the flood warning? Darn it. If I was only there a little longer.' 

The storm may have been a blessing for Switzerland's Roger Federer, though, who was losing the opening set 5-2 to Spain's Marcel Granollers in the third round.

Gutted: Matches started again in the evening once the rain ceased but ticket holders for the Arthur Ashe Stadium were forced to leave, according to reports
