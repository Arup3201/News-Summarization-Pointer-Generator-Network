Most pictures show polar bears on land, but as these incredible photographs show, when the ice begins to disappear, it doesn't prevent the majestic creatures from getting from A to B.

Wildlife photographer Paul Souders took his boat out in Hudson Bay, Canada, and captured the fearsome predators swimming underwater, including the mighty jaws of one biting at the camera. 

As ice begins to melt earlier each year, polar bears are learning to adapt and swim greater distances in search for food in one of the world's harshest environments. 

Fearsome: Wildlife photographer Paul Souders captured this close-up of a polar bear biting at the camera in Hudson Bay, Canada

Predator: Huge fangs used for hunting are visible, but now polar bears are having to swim greater distances in search of seals

Aquatic: Polar bears are actually very good swimmers with adaptations including thick blubber and nostrils that close

Kick: The feet of a swimming bear is seen as it goes in search of food after ice caps begin to melt in one of the world's harshest environments

Don't mind me: A candid shot captures a bear unaware as he shakes his fur dry against a rock after a swim in the icy waters

Warning: Scientists have warned that a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out due to global warming and shrinking ice caps

Bubbles: As ice begins to melt earlier and earlier each year, the bears are having to adapt to swim even greater distances than normal

Doggy paddle: A polar bear's head is seen emerging just above the water as it swims along the Frozen Strait on Hudson Bay

Look what I can do: Mr Souders dove near Vansittart Island near the Arctic Circle and used an underwater camera to capture this shot

Journey: He travels more than 1,500 miles from Manitoba, Canada to the edge of the Arctic to capture polar bears and walruses underwater

Hello: Through the window of Mr Souders' boat, a polar bear is seen approaching curiously on ice, which is melting earlier every year

Ready: Photographer Paul Souders with his boom and mounted underwater camera as he prepares to dive in Hudson Bay

Home: Paul Sounders' C-Dory 22-foot long Cabin Cruiser boat spent weeks travelling across the Arctic to capture these incredible photographs
