This cheeky chipmunk has no intention of leaving on an empty stomach.

The rodent, his cheeks full to bursting, ensure he stuffed as many peanuts as possible into his mouth before heading home.

He
 was caught in his act of gluttony by Brad Denoon, a Canadian 
photographer, as he fed them whilst he sat in his back garden in Trenton
 Ontario, Canada.

What you looking at? the cheeky chipmunk was quite content stuffing as many nuts into its mouth as it could manage

Who goes there? Brad Denoon regularly feeds the chipmunks outside his home in Trent Ontario, Canada

All mine: Mr Denoon said that they all come withing a few centimetre of him, regularly taking peanuts from his hand

'I regularly sit outside and feed the chipmunks, and have done for years now,' said Mr Denoon, 48.

'They have come to trust that I am not a threat, and they are comfortable when they approach me for food.

'They come within a few centimetres of me, regularly taking peanuts from my hand.

'They even climb on me from time to time, when they get impatient of waiting for me to hand over the food.

'I would have to say the chipmunks are pretty pleased with the easy food supply.'

Saving it for later? the chipmunk did not seem too interested in the food on offer to begin with, before changing its tune

Depending on the chipmunk, according to Mr Denoon, they usually take two or three before returning to unload their stash

Greedy: Rather than wait to go underground, this one was clearly unfussy and was happy to dig in in front of the photographer

The rodents tend to store non-perishables to help combat the harsh Canadian winters

Chipmunks
 gather food to feed their families and to store non-perishable foods so
 they are prepared for the Canadian winters, which last between six to 
eight months.

Luckily for 
these small creatures they can make light work of their food gathering 
thanks to their handy cheek pouches, enabling them to carry multiple 
nuts.

'Depending on the chipmunk, they would take either two or three before returning to the burrow to unload,' said Mr Denoon.'Generally speaking, they don't eat many of the nuts above ground. They dine in the evening underground, where it is safe.

'People seem to really enjoy the images of the chipmunks, the antics of these little critters are well known.'
