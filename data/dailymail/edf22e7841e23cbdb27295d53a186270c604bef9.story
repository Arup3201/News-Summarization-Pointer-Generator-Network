This is the shocking scene that confronted a student when he discovered a car windscreen smashed to pieces by a swan. 

University of Hull undergraduate Tim Barrass, 20, was on his way to morning lectures when he noticed the car had been damaged.

The windscreen was smashed and had buckled slightly and there was a prostrate swan lying next to it on the pavement.

University of Hull undergraduate Tim Barrass was on his way into lectures when he noticed his neighbour's car had been damaged - and spotted a swan lying next to it

Mr Barrass immediately called the RSPCA who soon arrived at the scene and took the swan to a rescue centre, but so far vets have been unable to work out how the swan managed to smash into the car.

They believe the swan could have collapsed mid-flight  - or may even have flown straight into the windshield.

The black Renault Clio was parked on a residential street in the student area of the city. 

Mr Barrass, a third-year History student, told student newspaper The Tab: 'I'd only been awake for ten minutes so I rubbed my eyes to double check it [the swan] was real.

'I presumed it was dead, but then it started honking and that's when I noticed the car next to it with the windscreen smashed in.

Mr Barrass said his friend Vicky Price was gutted it shattered her windscreen.

He said: 'It could have thought it was a river and when it's coming down, it must be pretty hard for a big bird like that to stop.

'It must have been a pretty hard impact, it was a big thing too. I know you get birds flying into windows but it shouldn't have hit a car.

'When I saw the damage I went round ringing on all the houses to see whose car it was because the owner might have thought someone had vandalised their car.

'When I realised it was Vicky's car, I told her. She was gutted.'

He added: 'She lives on the next street over but parked on our road because there were no spaces.

'She said the windscreen is a total right off - it's just bad luck.' 

RSPCA vets put the swan down because its injuries were so severe- they have not been able to find out out if the bird fell or flew into the car (pictured are the RSPCA headquarters in Horsham, West Sussex)

'Trying to be Sherlock I deduced it must have fallen onto the car and bounced off.' 

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'We were called to an incident in Hull where an adult swan had fallen from the sky and crashed in to a car windscreen on Tuesday morning.'

The swan's chest injuries were so severe vets were unable to find the original reason for the swan's collapse.

The representative added: 'Sadly the injuries the swan sustained in the fall were very severe and on vets advice he was put to sleep.

'It is a mystery as to why this happened and the only thing we can put it down to is exhaustion.'

The Queen's swan keeper said the may have mistaken the wet road for a river in the sun's early morning glint.

Professor Chris Perrins, who has been Her Majesty's Warden of the Swans since 1993, said: 'Especially in dawn and dusk they mistake the wet road for a river and try and land on it.

'At this time of year when the sun's low and the roads are wet the RSPCA and swan rescuers get called out quite regularly to roads where they have crashed.

'They shouldn't fly into cars but it can happen.'

As the first person to be the Warden of the Swans he has met the Queen several times and is in charge of the annual Swan Upping, where the birds are counted in a census.

The former Oxford researcher added: 'They are at the top end of the limits for a flying bird they can only take off really slowly and they don't have much ability for sudden manoeuvres.

'When the sun's coming up or going down and it's wet, the road can have a glint. That's my bet for what happened.' 

Mr Barass, who shares his home with five other students, added: 'I rang my flatmates after the RPSCA, they don't usually get out of bed until ten but they woke up straight away when they got the phone call from me.

'They saw the photo and thought it was totally bizarre.'
