Etiquette: Major General Alex Cowan wrote the letter to senior officers, referring to the practice of some soldiers in Bulford, Wiltshire

A PRIVATELY-educated Army commander has banned sandwiches from the officers’ mess, saying that ‘a gentleman or lady always uses a knife and fork’.

In a three-page attack on slipping standards, Major  General James Cowan told his troops that eating with their hands is ‘barbaric’.

The decorated soldier wrote the memo – addressed to ‘Chaps’ – after being dismayed at the lack of etiquette at a military base.

In an email to junior commanders, he criticised the way his men incorrectly held cutlery, failed to stand when superiors entered the room and were guilty of poor grammar and writing.

Maj Gen Cowan, who has led British forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: ‘Quite a few officers in the divisional mess seem to be under the impression that they can eat their food with their hands.’ The practice of serving rolls and sandwiches in the mess is to stop.

‘A gentleman or lady always uses a knife and fork.

‘And while on the subject of knives and forks I see a great many frankly barbaric techniques on display.’

Keen to spell out how it should be done, the somewhat tongue-in-cheek memo even goes on to explain how cutlery should be held when eating – including that ‘the fork always goes in the left hand and the knife the right’.

Decorated: The Oxford-educated soldier has more than 30 years of experience and has served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland

Privately-educated: General Cowan attended the £30,000 a year Wellington College in Berkshire

Maj Gen Cowan, who is paid £115,000 a 
year, is in charge of 20,000 soldiers and 2,500 officers in 3 UK 
Division, which is mostly based at Bulford Camp, Wiltshire.

The
 soldier’s memo also embraced the subject of dinner parties: ‘A good 
party relies on good conversation. This requires you to come prepared to
 be free, funny and entertaining.’

Major
 Gen Cowan went on to give advice on the old-fashioned art of writing 
thank-you letters: ‘Thank-you letters are an art form not a chore.

Studies: He also attended Pembroke College at Oxford University before he enrolled in The Army in 1982

Sandwiches‘Quite a few officers in the divisional mess seem to be under the impression that they can eat their food with their hands. The practice of serving rolls and sandwiches in the mess is to stop. A gentleman or lady always uses a knife and fork.’CUTLERY‘The fork always goes in the left hand and the knife in the right. Holding either like a pen is unacceptable, as are stabbing techniques. The knife and fork should remain in the bottom third of the plate and never be laid down in the top half.’Officers‘Ten years ago, officers would stand up when the commanding officer walked into the room. This doesn’t happen any more. I expect a junior officer to make an effort at conversation. Start by introducing yourself and talk on any civilised subject outside work.’Successful marriage‘I recently went to a Burns Night, spoilt only by a curious decision to sit husbands next to wives. The secret of a successful marriage is never to sit next to your spouse at dinner. It displays a marked degree of insecurity.’

An Army spokesman 
said: ‘This note was part of a light-hearted correspondence between a 
commander and his officers about an expected code of behaviour.’

Maj
 Gen Cowan, who attended £33,000-a-year Wellington College in Berkshire,
 urged troops to stop using ‘pompous words’ and instead write with 
‘simpler language’.

He 
added: ‘Combined with underlining and italics, the wanton use of 
capitals, abbreviations and acronyms assaults the eye and leaves the 
reader exhausted.’

On the 
subject of marriage he is equally direct, advising officers that the key
 to matrimonial success was never to sit next to their spouse at dinner 
‘except when dining alone at home’ – or risk showing insecurity.

A source said: ‘Banning sandwiches and rolls is madness. This bloke is from a bygone age. The officers are bewildered.’

‘It is generally considered better manners if the spouse is the person who writes.’

Military
 insiders say the email was meant to address how the Army integrates 
with wider society and was not an indictment of the Forces’ lack of 
manners.
