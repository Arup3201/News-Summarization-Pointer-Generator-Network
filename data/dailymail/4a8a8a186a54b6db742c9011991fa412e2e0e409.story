David Beckham and his three boys were at the Maracana to take in the World Cup final on Sunday night - and there was no doubting which side they were supporting.

Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz were all kitted out in Argentina shirts as they took on Germany for the greatest prize in world football.

Their choice of attire may not have gone down too well with Brazilian heroes Pele and Kaka, with whom Beckham posed for photographs prior to kick-off.
