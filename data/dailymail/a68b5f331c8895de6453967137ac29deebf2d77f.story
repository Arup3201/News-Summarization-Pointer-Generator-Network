The estate of a woman fatally shot by her estranged husband along with their two daughters has sued a Cleveland-area Cracker Barrel restaurant, alleging it failed to protect them from him.

The lawsuit was filed late Thursday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court by the brother of Katherina Allen, who was shot on April 12, 2012, at the restaurant in nearby Brooklyn, Ohio.

The lawsuit seeks more than $125,000 in damages.

Fatal shooting: Kevin Allen became enraged and began shooting when his wife Katherina told him she was taking their daughters and leaving him

It said the restaurant failed to properly train employees to handle a volatile situation.

The company had a duty to customers to take precautions to protect them 'from known and foreseeable third-party criminal acts on its premises,' according to the lawsuit, which said Cracker Barrel had failed to do so.

Kevin Allen, 51, angrily confronted his 42-year-old wife at the restaurant and left, then returned and began shooting. Responding officers killed him.

While the Lebanon, Tenn.-based company cannot comment on the lawsuit, spokeswoman Jeanne Ludington said in an email, 'We believe that in times of difficulty, families and communities come together and we are grateful to the Brooklyn community for their continued support and acts of kindness.'

Katherina Allen called 911 from inside the restaurant, saying her husband was upset because she had told him she was leaving him.

He left the restaurant and was 
circling the parking lot, she told police. She also told police she 
feared he might become violent.

'I'm having some spouse problems,' Katherina Allen told the dispatcher in the 911 call before her husband went back inside.

Police
records dating back nearly 20 years painted a picture of Kevin Allen, 
married at least three times, as a violent man with a history of 
threatening wives and others.

Their 10-year-old daughter 
Kayla Allen was the last member of the family to die from her injuries 
when her father opened fire on her little sister's birthday party at 
Cracker Barrel.

Hospice of the Western Reserve in Cleveland released a family statement in May 2012 saying Kayla died peacefully at home.

Police
said Kayla's father shot and killed his wife and their other daughter, 
10-year-old Kerri Allen, before officers shot and killed him. Kayla and 
her sister were born about 10 months apart.

Witnesses said Kevin Allen went into the restaurant in Brooklyn, Ohio, with a shotgun and selectively fired on his family.

Officers heard gunshots when they arrived and saw Kevin Allen, 51, leaving the restaurant with a shotgun. Police Chief Scott Mielke said officers shot him when he refused to surrender, and he died at the scene.
