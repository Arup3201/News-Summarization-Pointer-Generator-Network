Luis Suarez has admitted he was moved by Steven Gerrard's video tribute last week when he was awarded the Golden Shoe for his 31 goals last season by former manager Kenny Dalglish.

'For such an important person in football to say that he missed me at Liverpool and to thank me for what I had done there, was emotional,' said Suarez in a TV3 interview in Barcelona.

'He was incredible as a team-mate for me, and the club treated me so well too. First by having the faith in me to sign me and then by supporting me in the way that they did. That is why I wanted someone important from the club to present me with the award.'

Suarez admits in the interview he thought he had 'ruined his career' when his bite on Giorgio Chiellini earned him a four-month ban from all football activity.

'I thought that I had ruined my career,' he said. 'At the start I didn't want to speak to anyone, I hid away behind my family although later I thought about it, I said sorry and I felt relief as a result.

'When I got the call from my representative I couldn't believe the faith that Barcelona were showing in me in this moment after everything that had happened.

'When the talks began with Barcelona and when (his agent) Pere Guardiola phoned me to say that it was all done I started to cry due to the situation that I was in and for the support that Barcelona were offering me.

'I had been worried that Barca would decide against it due to all the repercussions from the situation.' 

Suarez makes his debut on Saturday against Real Madrid, although he says he is not taking selection for granted and has been blown away by the level of his new team-mates. 

The former Liverpool striker said: 'If you are impressed by watching them on television then when you see them up close in training you are left even more impressed.

'You see a team-mate with three players around him and he still makes the pass and you just think: 'how did he do that?'

'I don't want to tempt fate by imagining myself playing [against Real],' he added.

'It is not my style to tell the trainer to play me in the game. I wouldn't dream of saying to Luis Enrique that I want to play in the Bernabeu. If I don't play then I won't be angry, I want to help my team-mates and feel like a footballer again.'
