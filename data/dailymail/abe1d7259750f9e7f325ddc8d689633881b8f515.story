A tiny spider that builds much bigger elaborate decoy spiders and hangs them in its web to fool predators has been discovered in the Peruvian Amazon.

The artful arthropod crafts its decoys from dead insects, debris and leaves in what scientists suspect is a defence mechanism to avoid being eaten.

It is believed to be a new species of Cyclosa, a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple, spidery legs.

Cunning: The spider sits above its decoy in a flood plain surrounding Peru's Tambopata Research Centre

Biologist and science teacher Phil Torres discovered the apparently novel spider in September as he led tourists in a floodplain surrounding Peru's Tambopata Research Centre.

'From afar, it appears to be a medium sized spider about an inch across, possibly dead and dried out, hanging in the center of a spider web along the side of the trail,' he wrote in a blog post for eco-tourism firm Rainforest Expeditions.

Such sights are not out of the ordinary for the Amazon, he writes, but as he approached the apparently decomposing arthropod it began to wobble back and forth as it it was alive.

'Step in even closer and things start to get weird- that spider form you were looking at is actually made up of tiny bits of leaf, debris, and dead insects,'

'The confusion sets in. How can something be constructed to look like a spider, how is it moving, and what kind of creature made this!?

'It turns out the master designer behind this somewhat creepy form is in fact a tiny spider'

Never seen before: The spider (pictured left in close up) is believed to be a new species in the genus Cyclosa, which includes other sculpting arachnids, but none of which have been observed to build such life-like replicas

Mr Torres, who divides his time 
between Peru and Southern California, told Wired the discovery was 
unlike anything he had ever seen before.

'It blew my mind,' he said.

Mr
 Torres contacted Linda Raynor, an arachnologist at Cornell University, 
who agreed it was an unusual find. She told Wired it was likely to be an
 unidentified species.

Even 
among the decoy-building species of Cyclosa, she said, decoys with legs 
and the web-shaking behaviour have not been observed before.

After
 speaking with experts, Mr Torres returned to the trails around 
Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the 
same floodplain.

Searches in other areas nearby did not find any of the spiders, he added, suggesting they have a restricted range.

William Eberhard, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who studies web-building, said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the Amazonian.

Cyclosa are known for decoy building, but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider.

'Known Cyclosa don’t have that spider-with-leg looking thing, which is why we think it’s a new species,' Mr Torres said.

He hopes to return to the area in January with a permit to collect samples, in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised.
