A 10-year-old boy has become the second youngster to die in a tragic river accident in two days after he fell into the water while on a family holiday.

Schoolboy Arran Cooper, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the early hours of this morning after he fell into the River Orchy, in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

His death came less than 24 hours after 13-year-old Kyrece Francis drowned in the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently jumping in the fast-flowing water to retrieve a football.

His death came after Kyrece Francis, 13, (right) was pulled from the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently drowning while trying to retrieve a ball

Both of the boys' deaths came as schools across the country broke up for the summer holidays.

Aaron had been on holiday in the forest reserve with his parents when the tragedy occurred at about 1.45pm yesterday.

A doctor who was also on holiday in the area saw the incident and swam across the river to help him after he got into difficulty, police said.

An RAF search and rescue helicopter, air ambulance and Police Scotland helicopter all attended the scene after a major rescue operation – also involving a Coastguard rescue team and forest rangers – was launched.

The youngster was rescued from the remote river by emergency services before being flown in the RAF Sea King helicopter to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.

However, he was later transferred to the city's specialist Yorkhill Hospital by ambulance, where he died in the early hours of this morning.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘At 1.45pm yesterday a 10-year-old boy fell into the River Orchy near to Allt Broighleachan in the Caledonian forest reserve, Glen Orchy.

‘He was rescued from the water and flown to Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow for treatment.

‘He died in the early hours of Wednesday July 23.

‘A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.’

In a similar tragedy, promising footballer Kyrece drowned on the second day of the school holidays after apparently trying to retrieve a ball.

The schoolboy is believed to have died after getting into difficulty in the fast-flowing River Thames in Buckinghamshire at about 4.30pm yesterday.

Today family, friends and teachers from Great Marlow School - where Kyrece studied - gathered for a brief memorial and to pay tribute to the popular pupil.

The acting headmaster of Great Marlow School, Linton Nash, paid tribute to Kyrece, who had only been a pupil for nine months.

He said: 'Kyrece Marshall-Francis was a charming and friendly young man, who was kind, respectful and sociable.

'Although he only joined the school nine months ago, he had already made a wide circle of friends and made a fantastic impact, especially in sport.'

Mr Nash added: 'Kyrece was a wonderful presence in his tutor group and set a great example to his peers with 100 per cent attendance and one of the highest number of reward points for effort, behaviour and supporting other pupils in his class.

'He had chosen his GCSE options for Year 10, including both PE and Drama at which he excelled. The whole school community will be devastated that Kyrece has died at so young an age and in such tragic circumstances.

'Everyone's thoughts are with his family and friends who can rely on our support as they begin to come to terms with his loss.'

The alarm was raised yesterday when a friend of Kyrece dialled 999 on his mobile phone to say that the boy had gone under the water and had failed to resurface.

It was believed he was swept downstream by the fast flowing current and his body was eventually found near the village of Bourne End.

Friends who were at the scene when the tragedy happened wrote on social media that before he disappeared beneath the surface for the last time, Kyrece shouted to his pals: 'I love you all.'

One woman broke down in tears as she read the tributes left to popular schoolboy Kyrece Francis, 13

More than 100 friends visited Great Marlow School today to pay tribute to Kyrece, with many leaving flowers

His mother, Simone Francis, wearing a bright blue football shirt, today hugged her son's devastated friends and looked at the mass of flowers that had been laid in tribute to the young Chelsea fan.

Kyrece's stepfather, Lewis Cooke, and his sister and step siblings were also said to have been present.

Three teenagers, softly spoken friends of Kyrece, addressed the mourners.

One said: 'The amount of people here shows how much everybody loved and respected Kyrece.'

Among the sea of flowers left at the gates of Great Marlow School were school shirts, teddy bears, balloons and flags.

One teacher, who declined to be named, said: 'He was a very popular boy. This is a lovely school and this is a testament of that. They were all very respectful.'

The body of the teenager was discovered by officers from the force's Specialist Search and Rescue Team shortly after 8pm last night.

Kyrece's mother, Simone Francis, was comforted by family members outside Great Marlow School today as dozens of pupils, relatives and friends paid tribute to the promising footballer who drowned yesterday

Several of Kyrece's friends appeared inconsolable as they gathered outside his school to pay tribute to him

Friends of Kyrece took to Twitter and Facebook to express their shock and sadness at his death.

One pal wrote: 'People are saying his body ended up being found in Bourne End. Shows how fast and strong that current was.

They continued: 'Also that before the last time he went under and did not come back up he said to Nathan, Josh, and Jamie etc. “Love you all".'

'I miss and love this guy so much he was just amazing and my love and respect goes out to his family mostly but also to his loving girlfriend. . . you just gotta keep your chin up.'

Kyrece was a pupil at Great Marlow School, which broke up for the summer holidays last week.

Police said neither of the deaths are believed to be suspicious and officers are preparing reports on both incidents to hand over to the coroner.
