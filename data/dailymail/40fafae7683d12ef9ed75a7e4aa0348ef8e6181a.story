For most people, solving a Rubik’s cube is hard enough - many houses have one of the unsolved puzzles stored away in a cupboard somewhere, away from frustrated eyes.

So if you fall into that group, look away now - because one company has made a giant version of the popular toy.

With more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy, the latest gadget promises to confound a whole new generation this Christmas.

Hong Kong-based Brando has released a larger version of a Rubik's cube (shown). Each of its six sides have a huge 169 coloured tiles - 1,014 in total

Called the Pillow 13x13x13 IQ Brick, the cube is formed from 13 squares in a row on each side of the cube.

In total the 3D puzzle features 1,014 coloured tiles that have to be matched up in order to complete the buzzle.

That means each side has a rather daunting 169 coloured tiles, compared to just the nine found on a regular Rubik’s Cube.

Its makers, Hong Kong-based Brando, claim it is ‘good for creative thinking and improving both your IQ and EQ [emotional intelligence]’.

However, anyone wanting to try and solve the puzzle might be put off by the price - a whopping £205 ($320) - which is almost as head scratching as the toy itself.

Brando says the toy has a quality design and is made to handle smoothly.

It is also apparently good for training both your left and right brain, according to the company.

However, with regards to any hints to solving it, Brando only suggests taking a ‘tea break’ and retrying it.

The Pillow 13x13x13 IQ Brick has more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy - which has 54. It is also slightly curved on each side. But the price is equally challenging - at a whopping £205 ($320)

The original Rubik's cube (shown) was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974 - but compared to the latest version, it has just a paltry 54 coloured tiles

Single time: Mats Valk of the Netherlands in March 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds at the Zonhoven Open in Belgium.

Average time: Feliks Zemdegs at the Melbourne Cube Day 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve time.

One-handed solving: A time of 9.03 seconds was made by Feliks Zemdegs at the Lifestyle Seasons Summer 2014

Feet solving: Fakhri Raihaan solved a Rubik's Cube with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the Celebes 2012.

Robot: Cubestormer 3 solved a Rubik's Cube in 3.253 seconds - beating the Cubestormer 2's record of 5.27 seconds.

A few days ago, Marcin Kowalczyk produced a moment for fans of the original Rubik’s cube to savour - when he solved the puzzle blindfolded in just 21.17 seconds - a new world record.

The speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the Rubik’s cube and then, while blindfolded, he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in Szczecin in western Poland.

A judge held a piece of paper between Marcin's face and his hands to make sure he couldn't peek under his mask.

His celebration was subdued, however, as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle.

Quite how he’d cope with the 13-cubed Rubik’s cube while blindfolded remains to be seen - or rather not seen.
