The lights in Times Square are about to get a lot brighter.

A megascreen is set to light up on Tuesday night in front of the Marriot Marquis hotel.

It is billed as the world's largest high definition video display, measuring eight-stories high and 330-feet-long - almost  the length of a football field. 

It is also ranked as the priciest outdoor advertising spot in the country with a going rate of more than $2.5 million for four weeks.

He continued: 'We experienced tremendous pre-sale interest, and the display is sold out to one advertiser through January 2015.
