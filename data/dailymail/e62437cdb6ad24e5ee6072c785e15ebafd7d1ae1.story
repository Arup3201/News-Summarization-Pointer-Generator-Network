Emmanuel Adebayor was drinking from a coconut and Harry Kane was shuffling on the bench. It’s hard to imagine either of them making the kind of mess of the game-changing chance that came Roberto Soldado’s way during the first half.

He went through on goal at 0-0 and was caught between thoughts of passing to Nacer Chadli or shooting. In that moment, he forgot his prime function in this team and also forgot how to pass. 

Such is the lot of a striker without great confidence; such is the frustration for a manager – you make a choice and be damned.

Mauricio Pochettino knew people would be wondering about the shooting star on his bench. He also knew that if Kane, fresh and ready, turns up and grinds Chelsea into the Wembley dirt on Sunday then all will be forgotten. Indeed, he would be the ‘genius’ who figured it all out.

Pochettino knows better than anyone that such rash judgements have always run always through football. Win and you’re smart; lose and you’re stupid. Win on Sunday and you picked the right team on Thursday, regardless of how you did in Florence.

He summed it all up rather neatly on Wednesday afternoon when he was asked to explain the dilemmas of selecting a side to play a hard game in Europe four days before a potentially season-defining cup final.

‘If you make the rotation and on Sunday you win, you are a genius. Sunday you may rest some players and play others and win the final – genius. If you lose in Italy and the final, you are a bad manager and coach.

‘I’m the same coach but when you take a decision sometimes you are right or wrong, but this is football. We take a decision to try to win tomorrow and play better than Fiorentina. After we analyse again and try to put the best team out for the final on Sunday.’

It is a black and white view, except here he found a shade of grey. It remains to be seen what kind of a beating he will take.

This was neither an excessively strong side nor one you would say was a cop out to rest players for the weekend. Kane was the notable omission and you could also make reasonable predictions that Ryan Mason, Danny Rose and Kyle Walker will start at Wembley. 

They were all on the bench in Florence, with as many of seven of the starters good bets to line up from the beginning against Chelsea.

So the numbers were good. But there is no escaping that the club’s most incisive player was on the bench for a game against a team unbeaten in 10. More to the point, Tottenham needed to score to simply stay alive, the consequence of the away goal they conceded at White Hart Lane last week.

Pochettino will point to the subtleties of a decision few can fully understand. They alone will know how tired Kane is after leading this team in his breakthrough season.

Football is full of players pushed too hard too soon. And in a team that has played 43 games this season – more than any other Barclays Premier League side – fatigue needs to be managed carefully. But there have been no indications that Kane, in particular, is carrying injuries or struggling with his workload.

The only indications are that he is a player who scores goals when they are needed. They were needed on Thursday night as a chance went begging in a competition that rewards its winner with Champions League football.

Of course it is the kind of short-term thinking that Pochettino dislikes. If he scores on Sunday, no doubt all will be forgiven.
