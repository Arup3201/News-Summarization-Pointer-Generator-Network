A third mother has died at a scandal-hit hospital maternity unit which is being investigated by detectives.

Five babies have also apparently died as a result of alleged poor care at Furness General Hospital in Barrow.

Health chiefs are now investigating the death of 26-year-old Carly Scott who passed away last Wednesday. She had been discharged after having her baby a week previously.

Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria, is under investigation after a series of deaths at its maternity unit

Hospital officials are refusing to discuss the circumstances surrounding the death but an inquest is expected to open next week.

Several NHS investigations have found the hospital's maternity unit to be failing and inquests into some of the deaths have already highlighted blunders.

She had only been home a few days with her first child, George, when she was re-admitted.

Police were called in to investigate the other deaths after allegations were made about the conduct of medical staff, evidence given to inquests and the alteration of medical records.

An internal and external NHS investigation into her death has already begun.

In February NHS watchdog Monitor issued a report that said the hospital was still failing women and their babies.

Mrs Scott- from Barrow - had only married long time love Nick Scott last summer.

Last night her family and friends were too distressed comment on what led to her death.

In a statement, her family said: 'We are shocked and devastated by her very sudden death. Thanks to family friends and well-wishers for their continued support and special thanks to all the medical staff involved with Carly's care.

'We would now like to be left alone to grieve in private.'

Mrs Scott worked in the planning department at defence manufacturer BAE Systems in Barrow.

Work colleague Dave Taylor described her as 'a wonderful young woman with a bright future'.

He said: 'She was a very kind, considerate, loving and respected person. She would have been a great mother. She kept us all updated on her progress while pregnant and was really enjoying life.'

Another colleague, Shirley Coyle, said: 'She was a lovely, lovely girl, a really beautiful girl inside and out. She could make you laugh no matter how low you were.

'I was arranging my wedding and she rang me with all sorts of websites and people who she had used for hers.

'She couldn't have been any more helpful. She will be so sadly missed.'

Lisa York, a friend of Mrs Scott's mum Angela, said: 'Carly was one of life's rays of sunshine and always had a smile on her face, she would light up a room with her smile.

'She will be missed by a lot of people. My heart goes out to her mum Angela, her husband and her newborn son. Heaven has got another angel, but taken too soon.'

George Nasmyth, interim medical director of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, which runs FGH, said: 'To lose a family member at such a young age is nothing short of tragic and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to Mrs Scott's family.

'It is our routine procedure to investigate all cases like this to identify and, if necessary, act upon any areas where our care could improve.

'We will continue to liaise directly with the family and offer them support wherever we can.'
