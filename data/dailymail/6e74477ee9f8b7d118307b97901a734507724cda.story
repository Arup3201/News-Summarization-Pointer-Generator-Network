A dog lover spoke of his amazement yesterday after he was reunited with the runaway pet he thought had died, two days after burying the wrong animal.

Scott Walker, 36, had been searching for his missing border terrier Jimmy for a week when he received devastating news that a dog had been found dead next to a busy road.

A heartbroken Scott and his girlfriend Cathy Herse, 35, went to the scene and as the dead dog was barely recognisable, the couple thought it was their beloved Jimmy.

Jimmy went missing after he ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk in Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, on December 10

The tearful couple said their goodbyes and buried the dog, but two days later Scott received a phone call from a lady who had found Jimmy.

Mr Walker, from Edinburgh, said: 'It's unbelievable, but true. It really is a Christmas miracle. We got a call from a lovely lady saying she found him in her garden.

'She managed to get him to come for food and she popped a lead on him. She then got him some food and water and called us. We got a very warm welcome from him and he's now sleeping in his favourite place.

'Sadly, we buried another wee doggy that we thought was Jimmy. It was the same colour and the same size but it was very difficult to identify. We had no reason not to think it was him.'

Jimmy ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk with Mr Walker and Ms Herse in Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, on December 10.

The couple printed off more than 
1,000 flyers and 100 posters in their hunt for the dog, and Mr Walker 
even took a week off work to concentrate on the search.

Five
days later, they received the news they were dreading: a black and tan 
border terrier had been lying dead on the City of Edinburgh Bypass, 
within three miles of where Jimmy was last seen.

The couple retrieved the body and buried him near a walking route beside Swanston Golf Club.

However, two days later their grieving was interrupted by a phone call from a resident in nearby Fairmilehead, who had spotted a 'missing' poster they had placed on Facebook.

She said she had Jimmy, and that he was fit and well.

Mr Walker said: 'I couldn't believe it. To say we had given up hope was an understatement. We had just buried him, after all.

'He was limping slightly and had a bit of a wild look in his eye, but other than that he was fine. We took him to the vet and found that he had lost over a kilo in weight. It's thought that he survived by maybe feeding on a dead deer carcass.'
