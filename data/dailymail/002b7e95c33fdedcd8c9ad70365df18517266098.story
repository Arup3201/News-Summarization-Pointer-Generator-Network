A 12-year-old member of a Japanese pop group has been in a coma for more than a week after inhaling helium during a television show stunt.

The unnamed girl is a member of the 3B Junior group, a collective of 25 singers aged between 10 and 16 that are hugely popular in the country.

She was inhaling helium from a canister as part of a game that involved changing her voice, when she fell unconscious and has yet to recover.

She was immediately rushed to a Tokyo hospital, where local media reported she was found to have suffered an embolism in the blood supply to her brain. 

A spokesman for TV Asahi revealed the girl was one of five youngsters taking part in the recording of a variety show on January 28 when the incident happened. 

The girl is believed to now be  showing signs of activity, including the moving of her eyes and limb, and the spokesman added: 'There are signs of recovery, but she is still not fully fit.'

Despite the young girl's public status, her name has not been revealed because she is a minor.

TV Asahi has apologised for the incident and said an internal probe into the case was under way. The canister from which she inhaled the gas was marked for adult use only, the channel admitted.

Local media said police had also launched an investigation on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in injury.

Inhaling helium is a common party trick, but can prove fatal and deaths have previously been recorded.

The UK's Public Health Agency warns that 'breathing in helium...deprives vital organs of essential oxygen' and can can cause 'dizziness, headache and suffocation'.

Japanese TV is internationally renowned for the outrageous nature of their game shows, which often feature members of the public and celebrities compting in shows that involve dangerous or humiliating tasks.

In 2012, a popular comedian broke his back when he jumped into a swimming pool as part of a programme.
