A one-legged Paralympian known for his hilarious Halloween getups that utilize his disability has bested himself with an amazing flamingo costume.

Using a bright pink body suit, similarly colored crutches, and a slipper made to look like the tropical bird’s head, Josh Sundquist does a striking impression of a flamingo.

But only when he flips upside down.

Hilarious: Cancer survivor, motivational speaker, and Paralympic athlete Josh Sundquist has topped his previous funny Halloween costumes with this awesome flamingo disguise

Tradition: Sundquist has gotten lots of media coverage for his costumes before, like his half eaten gingerbread man in 2010 and the leg lamp from A Christmas Story in 2012

The Paralympic ski racer uses his athleticism in this year’s costume. When he inverts his body, his leg looks just like the long neck and curved bill and head of the bird.

In 2010, Sundquist made his national debut as a Halloween champion as a half-eaten gingerbread man.

Accomplished: After losing his leg during a battle with childhood bone cancer, Sundquist trained hard and became a Paralympic athlete. He has since become a motivational speaker, bestselling author, and founder of a social media site for amputees

In 2012, he lit up Halloween as the famous leg lamp from A Christmas Story.

In addition to his Sundquist Halloween costumes, Sunquist’s trademark is his remarkable story of survival and triumph over disability, one he goes into a length on his website.

Diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer at age 9, Sunquist was given a 50 percent chance of survival.

But he survived and after losing his leg to amputation he’s put his disability to good use: he’s now a motivational speaker, a member of the US Amputee Soccer Team, bestselling author, YouTube personality, and founder of LessThanFour.org, the world's largest social networking website for amputees.

While his latest costume pales in comparison to these achievements, it still manages to be just as uplifting.

As the person who uploaded the picture to Reddit wrote, ‘When life hands you lemons…become a flamingo.’
