A couple who tipped the scales at 45 stone have shed almost a third of their body weight in time for their wedding day.

Kim James, 35, and Lee Coggins, 37, from Bristol, gained weight on a calorie-packed diet eating junk food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

On a typical evening, they would consume garlic bread, two large pizzas, ice cream and three bags of chocolate, between them washed down with beer and wine.

At their heaviest, Kim weighed 19st 10.5lbs and was a size 24, while Lee weighed in at 25st 4lbs and had to have his 56-inch waist trousers made online.

But after joining a slimming club two years ago they shed 14 stone between them and are now at their ideal weights for their wedding in March.

Kim said: 'I couldn’t bear people watching me eat because I was just worried they were thinking why is she eating all that when she is so fat already?

'Sometimes I would deliberately not buy any chocolate but by 7pm we would usually crack and drive to the garage which is literally a few minutes’ walk away.'

Kim and Lee are set to tie the knot in a VW themed ceremony in line with their love for camper vans, which Kim says may not have happened if they hadn't lost weight.

She said: 'I would have hated having my photos taken on my wedding day. In fact If I was the same size we would not be getting married.

'There will be some very shocked friends at the ceremony - especially ones that haven't seen us for a while.'

The couple decided it was time to lose weight after Kim saw a picture of herself holding her newborn daughter and Lee's weight exceeded the maximum measured by their Nintendo Wii.

The parents of Georgina, six, and Gracie, two, joined Slimming World in September 2011 and immediately began to shed their excess weight.

Kim and Lee say they are much happier now and that the wedding might never have happened if they hadn't lost weight

Lee said: 'When I found out what my weight was I was actually scared.

'I went on the scales on the Nintendo Wii but it only went up to 23st and then it told me to get off.

'I didn’t think I could be heavier than that but when I did weigh myself I was 25st 4lbs. Unbelievable.'

Kim, who lost seven stone, added: 'I always knew I was overweight but until I saw a photo I didn’t realise just how bad I'd become.

'The hardest part was it was a photo with my two girls, one of whom was brand new, and I didn't want to show anybody because I looked awful.

'I had always struggled with my weight but had just avoided having my pictures taken.

'I have no photos with Georgina when she was tiny because I didn't like having cameras anywhere near me.

'It makes me say because I can never have that time back.'

Lee, who also lost seven stone, said their decision to shed the pounds has had a beneficial effect on the happiness of the family.

He said: 'Now as a family we can do a lot more. We can go swimming or go to the beach.

'It's great being able to go on the adventure playground with the kids and seeing how much happier it makes them. Before we would have sat having a cup of tea and a cake whilst they played.

'There is a lot more laughter in our life now, we enjoy life so much more. We are like big kids.'
