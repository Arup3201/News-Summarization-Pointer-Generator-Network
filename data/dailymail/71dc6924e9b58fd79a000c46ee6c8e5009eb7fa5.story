Frank Lampard will lead England out in their final game at the World Cup against Costa Rica on Tuesday.

England captain Steven Gerrard will be on the bench for the game, as Roy Hodgson looks to give game time to those of his squad yet to play in Brazil.

Dejection: Gerrard's England career looks like it will end with the error that allowed Luis Suarez to score

36-year-old Lampard will captain his country in what could well be his final appearance, with both he and Steven Gerrard considering international retirement after the tournament.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has suffered a recurrence of his knee injury and will the game against Costa Rica.

Chance to shine: Ross Barkley will start in midfield after looking lively in his two substitute appearances so far

Leighton Baines has a hamstring strain so Luke Shaw will start, while Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere are expected to play from the start, both having made only substitute appearances so far.
