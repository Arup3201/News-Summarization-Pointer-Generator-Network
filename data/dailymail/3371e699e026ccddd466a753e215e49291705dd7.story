Google Inc co-founder Sergey Brin has separated from his wife of six years, and now the 40-year-old Silicon Valley mogul is reportedly dating a younger employee. 

Brin and Anne Wojcicki, who married in 2007, have been living apart for several months, the couple's spokesperson said last night.

'They remain good friends and partners,' the spokesperson added.

The woman said to be seeing Brin has been named in reports as Amanda Rosenberg, a 26-year-old Google Glass marketing manager. There is no suggestion that the couple were dating before Brin separated from his wife.

The 26-year-old, who describes herself
as Asian but moved to the UK, has played a key role in the development 
of Google Glass and came up with the product's buzz phrase 'OK glass'.

She joined Google as an account manager in June 2008 before becoming mobile business development manager EMEA two years later.

Wojcicki, 40, is the chief executive of a biotech firm that Google has invested millions of dollars in and whose sister is one of the Internet search company's top executives.

The technology blog AllThingsD on Wednesday was the first to report of the couple's split and Valleywag named Rosenberg. Brin and Wojcicki, who have two children and who have a prenuptial agreement, are not yet legally separated, the report said.

Susan Wojcicki, Anne's sister, is senior vice president of Ads and Commerce for Google and is considered one of the Internet company's top executives.

The relationship between Google and 
the Wojcickis dates back to the company's earliest days: in 1998, the 
nascent search company set up shop in Susan Wojcicki's garage shortly 
after raising its first funding.

Google
has invested roughly $10million in 23andMe, the company that Miss 
Wojcicki co-founded in 2006 and which sells DNA testing kits and 
provides clients with information about their ancestry and medical 
conditions.

Forbes said that Mr Brin is currently worth $22.8billion and holds more than $20billion worth of Google shares.

Since Larry Page took over as CEO of Google, Brin has been spending most of his time at Google’s research lab, Google X, which has been developing ambitious ‘moon shot’ projects like the Glass and a self-driving car.

Brin and Wojcicki have gained a 
reputation as a philanthropic power couple, donating tens of millions of
dollars to a variety of charitable organizations.

In 2012 alone, the couple gave away $223million, Los Angeles Times
reported, earning them the distinction of being the fifth biggest 
donors to U.S. charities, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Much of the funds went to their own charity, The Brin Wojcicki Foundation, which promotes human rights and anti-poverty programs.

San Jose Mercury reported that they have also given tens of millions of dollars to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, and the couple co-founded a new organization along with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, which awards $15million prizes to life scientists.

According to reports, Brin has been linked to Google Glass Marketing Manager Ms Rosenberg.

Ms Rosenberg was appointed marketing manager in January 2012 moving from London to work at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and within seven months was assigned to heading up marketing for the Google Glass.

In her blog, she charts her first thoughts at starting work in the U.S. She said: 'Hello new boss, hello new team... LIKE ME IMMEDIATELY.'

She explained the origins of the product's key phrase 'OK glass' on her Google Plus account earlier this year.

The idea came about while she dined with Glass project manager Mat Balez.

When he told her that a phrase that transcended different cultures was needed to activate the Glass menu and let the device know that the wearer wants to use it, she came up with the phrase.

Not only did she consider it to be suitable for a global product, it was also decided that it was subtle enough not to embarrass the user in public.

According to her post, the phrases 'go go Glass' and 'Glass alive' and even 'pew pew pew' were said to have been considered before her idea.

Reports of the romance come as another Google high-flyer, with whom she has been romantically linked, Hugo Barra, quit the company to work for a Chinese smart phone firm.

Mr Barra, vice president of Android product management, presided over the much-trumpeted launch of Google's Nexus tablet.

He announced his departure for Chinese company Xioami on his Google Plus account after five years at the firm.

He said he had 'decided to start a new career chapter'.

In the post, Mr Barra also said that his colleagues at Google are 'the most amazing group of people I've ever worked with in my life.'
