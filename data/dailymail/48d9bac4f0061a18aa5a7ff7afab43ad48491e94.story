A schoolgirl who penned a guide to dealing with her mother's epilepsy is celebrating after becoming a published author - aged just seven.

Talented Layla Reid wrote her 'Epilepsy Book for Kids' as a guide to help children cope with an epileptic parent's seizures, after witnessing her own mother's fits.

Sarah Reid suffers from terrifying absence seizures, where she appears to be in a deep daydream.

Literary star: Layla Reid, 7, with her Epilepsy Book for Kids, a guide to coping with a parent's epileptic seizures

When Layla showed her book to Bristol publisher John Adler, he was so impressed that he agreed to print it free of charge, and give her a share of the profits.  

The book is now on sale in major stores including Waterstones, priced at £6.50.

The budding writer said of her work: 'I hope it helps some other children so that they know what to do if their mummy has a fit.'

Mrs Reid, 31, has suffered from seizures since she was Layla's age, and couldn't be prouder of her daughter's initiative.

She hopes the book will prove a valuable resource for children coping with a parent's epilepsy.  

She said: 'I'm so proud of her, I never thought in a million years it would be published.

Couldn't be prouder! Mother Sarah Reid, 31, hopes her daughter's book will reassure and inform children

'I always wanted to be a writer when I was younger, but it's just one of those things isn't it.

'I really hope she can help a lot of children and let them know they are not alone.

'It’s great to have her raising awareness and helping other kids. It could end up being a life-saver for someone.

'I think she has had to grow up quite quickly because of my epilepsy. She’s a clever girl. We’re so proud of her.'

Educational: The book is written in Layla's handwriting, and in a simple, child-friendly style

Amazingly, the entire book was produced in just one evening. Written in Layla's handwriting, it includes straightforward tips that children can easily follow - such as moving dangerous objects out of the way if someone starts fitting.

It also features her own illustrations.

The guide came about after Mrs Reid tried and failed to find a child-friendly book which could explain epilepsy.  

Dreaming of the future: Layla says her next project will be a story about her baby sister, and the things they will do together when she's older

When she realised there was hardly any information for children, Layla came up with the idea of writing a guide for other kids - so they know what to do if they witness an epileptic fit.

Self-confessed bookworm Layla plans to keep up her writing, and hopes this will be the first of many stories.

The seven-year-old says her next venture will be a tale about her baby sister Lauren, who arrived five weeks ago.

'I’m very happy to have a new sister, and I’m very proud,' she said.

'I want to write a story about all the things we’ll do together for when she’s older.'

Layla's teachers have noticed a 
massive improvement in her writing and enthusiasm for schoolwork since 
she wrote the Epilepsy Book for Kids. 

'We hope she’ll encourage some other children in her class to start writing too,' her mother said.

Young though she is, Layla has already set her heart on a career in education.

'I want to be a teacher,' she says, 'because it’s a job where you get to do reading and writing and that’s what I want to do.'
