Songs from Amy Winehouse's posthumous album have been revealed - but reviews say she may not have liked how it turned out.

Amy Winehouse Lioness: Hidden Treasures, which contains original tracks as well as covers, is to be released on December 5.

One song, Between the Cheats, reportedly tells of cheating
ex-husband Blake Fielder Civil.

Another was apparently recorded while the 
singer was high on drugs.

Most of the recordings are just the first takes of songs which have been reworked by producer Salaam Remi who added backing tracks and vocals.

He had worked with the singer on her two 
albums Frank and Back to Black and was slated to produce her third.

He says he only spent two weeks polishing the material after the singer died on July 23.

Seven of the 12 tracks were revealed 
to journalists in a Soho recording studio yesterday.

In one of the recordings, Song For You, Amy bursts into tears, Salaam recalled.

The album is said to feature original tracks and covers, one of which is a recording of jazz standard Body and Soul with Tony Bennett, left

One journalist wrote: 'It is hard to believe that 
Winehouse herself – who oversaw every aspect of the two albums she 
released – wouldn't have reworked much of the material that is to be put
out.

'There are certainly times when her vocal on a song sounds more 
like a sketch, even if she was an instinctive artist who appreciated the
magic of capturing a first take.'

She added: 'At best, the seven tracks sounded like 
the basis for another hit album, although it's hard to make any kind of 
judgment on the basis of one listen.'

Saleem declined to reveal a 
Frank-era live set opener called Best Friends, an early version of the hit 
Valerie, a demo of the song Wake Up Alone, a version of the Shirelles' 
Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow and the Tony Bennett duet Body and 
Soul.

He explained of the album: 'Lots of people are going to want to remember 
other aspects of her life, but what we have here highlights that 
musically and creatively, she was the tops. She was a great musician and
a great songwriter as well. She wasn't a musical fluke.'

After playing the seven tracks, Saleem explained that he was in London the weekend Amy died.

They had 
planned to attend a friend's wedding with her on the Sunday morning, but
'before I could make it from Shepherd's Bush to Notting Hill, she had 
gone'.

'For me, working on a record was a healing process. He 
said he had only needed to spend two weeks of further production on the 
tracks since his friend's death.

'I had a big brother relationship with 
her – with me, there was a musical space where she could be herself and 
not worry about anything else. And with this record: I wanted to get it 
off my chest. I knew what material was there, and I didn't want to 
rehash the pain that I feel now, in 12 months time ... These songs, I'd
like people to know them. I didn't want them sitting on a hard drive, 
wilting away.'

He added: 'I know there were times when she wasn't in great shape – 
although personally, I didn't really see that side of her; it didn't go 
on in my presence – but music for her was her escape.'

A label executive said there was a trove of live material which could be released in the future.

'We're 
not looking to paper over any cracks with this record.

'We want this album to be good enough to exist on its own 
merits, and we think it's faithful to her legacy. Whether you can hear 
every lyric on every song or not, you can always hear the emotion 
there.'

Between the Cheats

The song was recorded in May 2008, 
for possible inclusion on Amy's planned third album.

The song is 
another with a heavy doo wop influence, and 'shows one of the main 
directions in which she was heading', says Salaam.

It has led to speculation that it references Amy's 
tempestuous relationship with her ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil, whom 
she divorced in July 2009.

But the big and brassy song starts with a spot of whistling and is not a maudlin ballad.

The lyrics can not be clearly heard – at least, not on
a first listen – although there is a reference to 'my husband'.

'Amy was mostly a one-take person,' said Salaam.

'Going through all the 
[computer] files of her music: it's mostly all one or two takes.'

A Song For You

Love hurts: The album is said to include a song about her ex Blake Fielder-Civil

This
version of the Leon Russell classic made famous by Donny Hathaway was 
recorded in one take at Amy's home studio in Camden in 
early 2009.

'She said to me, 
we can make the new album here,' Salaam recalled.

'We don't have to worry 
about the paparazzi.

'She was just lying down on a couch, with the mic in her hand and by 
about halfway through the song she was crying, really weeping, with 
makeup running down her face.'

The song concludes with the lines: 'And when my life is over/ Remember 
when we were together. We were alone and I was singing this song for 
you.'

After the song 
finishes playing, Amy is heard talking to Salaam, 
discussing the relative merits of Marvin Gaye and the singer who first 
made the song famous.

'Donny Hathaway,' she says.

'It was like he 
couldn't contain himself … he had something in him, you know.'

Our Day Will Come

Salaam explained that during the 
recording of Amy's debut album, Frank, the pair would play around with 
different versions of songs that they liked, once a vocal take was in 
place.

This song is a reggae version from those sessions in 2002 of this 1963 hit by doo wop outfit Ruby & the Romantics.

'It also points the way forward to the doo wop sound of Back to Black,' the producer said.

Tears Dry

The first take from November 2005 in Miami of the song which appears on
Back to Black.

'It brings another light to the song,' said Salaam.

'It's not so much about the production: it's her … making a 
direct connection with the listener.'

So, a ballad to which strings have
subsequently been added. But not – for this listener at least – a real 
tearjerker.

Like Smoke

Back then: Amy in 2004 when she wrote some of the songs

This song was recorded two weeks after Between the Cheats and features a guest 
appearance from the New York rapper Nas, whose verses were added 
subsequently to the recording.

'He was one of Amy's favourite artists,' 
Salaam said, adding that the song In My Bed from Frank, effectively 
sampled one of his tracks, while Me & Mr Jones told the story of 
missing one of his gigs.

'They had an affinity. Besides 
which, they were both born on 14 September.'

Nas references Amy's death, when 
he raps about a visit to Camden, and his belief in heaven.

Halftime

The
song was recorded three or four times in 2002 but missed the cut for the record
that became Frank.

It did, however, give that album its title, as 
Winehouse mentions Ol' Blue Eyes himself in the lyrics: 'And when 
Frank Sinatra sings, it's too much to take … he pacifies my ache'.

It is Winehouse's vocal and guitar playing that form the basis of the 
track, but Salaam later invited Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson of the Roots to
add a drum part.

The song starts in acoustic fashion, but when 
Winehouse sings "when the beat kicks in, everything falls into place", 
on cue, Questlove does his thing.

Again, as with so many Winehouse songs, it's a tale of heartache and 
fierce pride.

'You can try and stop me, Amy sings' 'but you won't
get the chance'.

The Girl from Ipanema

In May 2002, Winehouse met Remi in Miami for the first time.

'I didn't 
even know what she looked like at the time, but she came in with an 
acoustic guitar and sang this. Her voice just filled and lit up the 
room. She really put something into the song that I'd just not heard 
before.'

This 1960s hit takes that recording as its basis, and it's daft and fun, so 
never mind that it's clearly a half-finished take, with Winehouse 
resorting to scat singing.
