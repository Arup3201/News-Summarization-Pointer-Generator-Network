Iker Casillas insists the current Real Madrid squad is capable of continuing the club's success and would not be interested in making a move for  Lionel Messi if the Barcelona star became available.

Chelsea have been linked with the Argentina international after Messi is believed to have fallen out with manager Luis Enrique.

However, should Messi leave the Nou Camp, goalkeeper Casillas is adamant an offer won't come from the Bernabeu.

Asked if Madrid should make a move for Messi, the Real goalkeeper said: 'No. With the squad we have right now we're doing very well and we are achieving great things.

Casillas also dismissed claims the four-time European Cup winners are in turmoil despite the club's poor form and  recent sacking of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.

'I do not think that Barca are in crisis,' he said. 'I don't think so. Honestly from what I have seen and how it is right now, people are speaking more about things other than them.

'In La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, I don't think they are in crisis. They are a few points behind in the league, they haven't been eliminated in the cup or the Champions League yet.

'They are alive in all three competitions and Real Madrid do not have a wide margin at the top of La Liga. It is tight.'
