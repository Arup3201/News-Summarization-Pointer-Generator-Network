Marussia have confirmed they will run only one car at the Russian Grand Prix 'out of respect' to Jules Bianchi.

The Frenchman remains in a stable but critical condition in Mie University Hospital following his horror crash last Sunday.

And the British based team will leave his car vacant in Sochi, entering only the Briton Max Chilton, who said he is 'truly devastated' by his team-mate's condition, for this weekend's race.

Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone confirmed Marussia would not be sanctioned or penalised for only running one car.

A team statement read: 'The Marussia F1 Team will run a single car for the duration of the forthcoming grand prix weekend in Sochi out of respect for their driver Jules Bianchi, who remains in hospital in Yokkaichi, Japan, in a critical but stable condition.

'The team have written to the stewards of the meeting to inform them they have withdrawn their second car.

'Notwithstanding the presence in Sochi of Alexander Rossi, the nominated official reserve driver for the 2014 Russian Grand Prix, the team feels strongly that fielding a single car, that of driver No 4, Max Chilton, is the appropriate course of action under the difficult circumstances of the weekend.

'Jules' car crew have built a second car, which has been scrutineered and is ready to race, and this will remain on his side of the garage throughout the weekend.

'In support of Jules and his family, the team and their cars will carry the familiar '#JB17' graphic, to ensure that although Jules is not with them in Sochi this weekend, he is, nonetheless, racing on with the Marussia F1 Team.'

Bianchi underwent emergency brain surgery on Sunday evening after his crash. The 25-year-old Frenchman smashed into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka that was removing the wrecked Sauber of Adrian Sutil after the German hurtled off track into a tyre barrier.

Bianchi has been diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury to the brain whereby damage is widespread rather than localised in one particular area.

The prognosis is not good as such injuries often result in coma, and if severe, 90 per cent of patients never regain consciousness.

The incident has left the entire paddock in shock, with drivers such as Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso - both of whom visited Bianchi in hospital - clearly emotional as they spoke about their colleague. 

The 21 drivers on track will carry the message 'Tous avec Jules' (All with Jules) on their helmets, along with his race number of 17.

As for Chilton, he has now broken his silence over the accident involving his team-mate.

The 23-year-old Briton said: 'I don't know how to put into words how truly devastated I am by what has happened to Jules.

'The support from the F1 family has been incredible and all we can do is be there to support Jules' family at this difficult time.

'It is going to be a very emotional weekend for the whole team, but we will try to get through it and keep praying for Jules.'

Bianchi received urgent medical treatment after the crash but remains in hospital almost a week on

Questions have been asked about whether the Suzuka race should have started earlier due to conditions
