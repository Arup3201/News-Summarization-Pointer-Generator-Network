New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has used his debut on 'The Daily Show' to take a swipe at Upper East Side residents who complained about his incredibly slow response to last month's snowstorm. Â 

The Democrat tonight admitted to host Jon Stewart the city did a bad job at plowing the rich neighborhood, before jokingly threatening to unleash a plague of locusts on its wealthy residents.

'We have an experimental effort to get locusts up in there,' he jested, after Stewart pointed out that it was already the third storm since de 
Blasio took office on January 1.

Dad jokes: Mayor Bill de Blasio joked to 'The Daily Show' host Jon Stewart he planned to unleash a plague of locusts on snooty Upper East Siders

When Stewart noted it 'never snowed once' during the 
billionaire Bloomberg's 12 years in office, de Blasio countered: 'I think he paid the right guy. I mean, he has the money.'

The new mayor was heavily criticized early last month for not clearing the streets fast enough after the city was hit by a predicted storm.

Respected weatherman Al Roker led the charge, slamming de Blasio's claim that the storm arrived three hours earlier than expected.

Roker's fury was followed by scores of people dangerously tumbling to the ground on snow and ice-covered streets more than 24-hours after the snowstorm hit.

Breaking bread...and pizza crusts: Stewart schooled de Blasio in the art of eating pizza, New York-style, before the pair downed a drink

What was he thinking? De Blasio horrified New Yorkers after this picture of him eating pizza with a fork at Goodfellas Pizza in Staten Island on January 10 went viral

It wasn't long before Stewart schooled de Blasio in the New York art of eating pizza, after a photo of the liberal mayor using a fork and knife went viral.

'You're a man of the people, eat like one!' Stewart joked.

When he presented de Blasio with a slice, the mayor responded to the good-natured test with a prop of 
his own, whipping out a knife and fork from his jacket to laughter from 
the studio audience.

'As mayor of Napoli - I mean, New York City -
 we are always ready for our pizza,' de Blasio said.

The mayor had explained his pie consumption 
style as a nod to his 'ancestral homeland' of Italy.

De Blasio 
then used his hands to bite into a slice as Stewart slurped on a giant 
soda that the mayor's predecessor, Bloomberg, had tried to ban.

Unlike the normally staid Bloomberg, de Blasio frequently jokes around at his press conferences.

His jokes, which often fall under the heading of 'Dad humor', have a mixed success rate with the press corps, sometimes eliciting chuckles, other times groans.

His spokeswoman, Rebecca Kirszner Katz, told Politicker that de Blasio wrote his own jokes for the comedy show, filmed at the program's Manhattan studio.

De Blasio appeared eager to show off his wit to Stewart, who suggested that the mayor's strongly liberal views had him putting up 'posters of Lenin, Stalin' at his City Hall office.

The Che Guevara posters are very popular, they really are,' de Blasio retorted.

De Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, and the couple's son, Dante, stood by the sidelines of the studio and could be seen laughing.

Stewart, who once was a college roommate of failed mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, has frequently joked about his love for de Blasio and his Afro-sporting teenage son.

De Blasio was far more serious earlier in the day when he said he will soon unveil new steps in his campaign to combat income inequality.

De Blasio told WNYC radio that he plans to improve the city's living wage policy and will reveal other proposals during his first State of the City address next Monday.
