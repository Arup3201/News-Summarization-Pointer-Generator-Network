When you hit the spot, nothing feels better than scratching an itch.

And it seems this black bear has done just that.

Throwing its head back, it wiggles wildly up and down a tree in Okanogan Country, Washington - apparently dancing that niggling feeling away.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

That niggling feeling: This black bear was spotted trying to scratch its back on a tree in Okanogan Country

Getting into it: Wasting no time, it starts wildly dancing against the bark, swinging its head in circles

The video released by Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife is described as lessons on exactly how to itch a back.

The animal, one of just 25,000 of its kind, is caught in the act leaning against the bark of a tree in the sprawling woods.

Lost in the rhythm, it stamps its foot while lunging up and down in a circular motion.

Maximum extension: It throws itself int the air to build momentum as it appears to be enjoying it

And back down again: It pounds its paw down on the floor to rub its neck against the bark

Here we go again: The bear, one of just 25,000 of its kind, then swings back around to start the move again

At one point, it slows down, seemingly savoring the moment - before whirling its head around again and getting right back into the swing of it.

And then - out of the blue - it stops, jumps to its feet, and looks alert as if nothing had ever happened.

Facebook users rushed to comment on the adorable video, taken on September 21.

Delightful: The video, by Washington wildlife wardens, has been a hit on Facebook with hundreds commenting

Who's there? Then, as if nothing had happened, the bear jumps up alert looking around coolly and calmly

One commenter wrote: 'That is so cute!' 

Another said: 'I think I'll have to try that when I'm next in the woods.'

And one commented: 'Definitely needs to be set to music... he's got some mad skills.'
