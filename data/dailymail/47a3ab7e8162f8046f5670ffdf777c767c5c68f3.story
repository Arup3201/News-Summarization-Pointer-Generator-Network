This ten-year-old girl has got a head start on her dreams for a future career in medicine - by delivering her sister in the back seat of the family car.

Stephanie Zamora, ten, helped her mother Sandra deliver her new sister after she went into labour while the family were driving to the hospital last Tuesday morning.

The baby came quicker than expected forcing her father to pull over to the side of the road in Arlington, Texas.Â

Stephanie, who is in the fifth grade at South Davis Elementary School, had to translate the call from the 911 operator for her Spanish-speaking parents.

The 911 operator told her to put her new sister in her mother's arms and make sure the cord was not wrapped around the baby's neck.

She followed each instruction calmly and helped her mother give birth in the back seat of the family sedan.

The girl later told Ksn.com: 'I didn't know what to do because the baby was coming out... so I just got the baby out.'

Stephanie, whose voice remains steady throughout the 911 recording, wants to be a nurse when she grows up.
