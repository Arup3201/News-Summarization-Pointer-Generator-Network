Everton boss Roberto Martinez admits it was a relief that his side managed to scrape an FA Cup third round replay against West Ham after last week's clash at Goodison Park ended 1-1.

The two sides meet again on Tuesday night at Upton Park as they go head-to-head for a place in the fourth round, where a tie against League One opposition Doncaster or Bristol City await.

A week ago Romelu Lukaku scored a 92nd-minute equaliser as Everton looked to be heading for an early exit and Martinez said it felt like a victory after the match.

'We're pleased we have a replay to play,' the Everton boss is quoted as saying on the FA website. 'Draws are an emotionally tricky result in terms of how you feel about them.'

'It's still only a draw but when you are the team that gets the equaliser late in the game, it can feel like a victory. In the same way, when you concede late on, it can feel like a defeat.'

Martinez, who led Everton to a credible draw against Premier League champions Manchester City on Saturday, is expecting an open game against Sam Allardyce's high-flying West Ham.

'It (the Goddison Park tie) was a proper Cup game and I feel Tuesday will be exactly the same - two teams wanting to win and to score goals, that will make it really open.

'We always enjoy going to Upton Park and with our sold-out allocation once again, it's one we look forward to.'
