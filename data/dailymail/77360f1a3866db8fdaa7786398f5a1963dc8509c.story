Embarrassed: Dr Malcolm spoke of his 'deep regret' over the affair at the hearing

A respected family doctor who lost his job after he had a two year extra marital affair with a patient told of his shame, embarrassment and 'deep regret' at the fling today.

Married GP Dr Malcolm Kelvin, 58, swapped sexual texts with the woman and conducted the secret affair at his surgery after his colleagues had gone home for the day.

The woman, 50, who was also a health care assistant at the medical practise was said to have 'disposition, sensibility and was in control of her life.'

But the illicit romance ended after Kelvin’s wife looked at his mobile phone and discovered the flirtatious texts between him and his mistress.

Kelvin was a called to meeting by his three fellow partners at the Mount Farm Surgery in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk where he admitted the affair and later resigned.

'Today he apologised 'most humbly' for the affair as he faced a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) fitness to practise hearing in Manchester where he faces being struck off for misconduct.'

He admits the affair was improper but denies using his professional position as a doctor in order to secure a relationship with patient A claiming he regarded his mistress as a work colleague.

'I am appalled by my behaviour at the time,' said the doctor. 'I have asked myself thousands of times how I managed to get myself into the position and how a well-respected GP, with a good character finds his career collapsing around himself over such a fundamental breach of the sort of trust and honour that goes with my position.'

Earlier the hearing was told Kelvin, who joined the practice in 1984, met his mistress whilst she was working at the surgery.

She was also Kelvin’s patient at the practise and had been to six appointments with the doctor during the affair after suffering a shoulder complaint.

Each appointment with the woman - known only as Patient A should have lasted no longer than 10 minutes.

But the hearing was told the appointments appeared to be not only at the end of surgery but on two occasions they over-ran - one by 57 minutes and another by 18 minutes.

A distressed Kelvin eventually confided in another partner at the practice about the relationship with patient A in January 2011 after his wife discovered a text message on his phone which gave the relationship away.

It emerged the texts had began as early as 2008.

When asked if he admitted the relationship with patient A, Kelvin said: 'Sadly and with deep regret, yes. She had disposition, sensibility, aged about 50, and in control of her life, that’s what I would probably say.

'She was an extremely good employee, good at her job, with attention to detail, a good sickness record and was not in any way prone to sickness at all.

'I think I was feeling slightly ignored at home. I cannot tell you how the first text happened, it just sort of developed. I honestly couldn’t tell you who sent the first text. There were certainly some texts of a sexual nature.'

He said the sexual relationship didn’t start until March 2010 when Patient A ran smoking cessation advice sessions and he was on a rota working extended hours.

Kelvin continued: 'Our working life together presented us with the opportunity to have a sexual relationship once the surgery was closed for business and the secretaries had gone home for the day.

'I am embarrassed to say this but it is important that I acknowledge that that was the situation that developed.'

He said the pair had not struck up a sexual relationship before Patient A visited him for an appointment about her shoulder on October, 15, 2009.

Kelvin said there was no sexual contact between the two during appointments and when asked about the lengthy appointments, he suggested the computer must have been set to log off after a failure to shut down.

Speaking of the sexual encounters, Dr Kelvin added: 'They were after the extended hours, when the building was empty - around 8.30 or 8.45pm, something like that.

'The affair developed between patient A and myself because we worked together - had patient A not worked in the surgery, the affair would have never developed.'

He also said the affair would have happened, even if patient A registered with another practice - because they still worked together.

'It is my great shame that I’m here now because of that,' he added. 'I should have never started any kind of sexual relationship with her, it was inappropriate on all sorts of levels.

'It was only when my inappropriate behaviour was discovered that I actually came to realise what I had been doing, for which I apologise most humbly.'

'It was based on two people working together, but that doesn’t excuse it. I now accept that I crossed the boundary.

'It developed because we worked together as work colleagues and there was no real link in my mind or her that the relationship developed because she was a patient.

'I didn’t give it the significance that it obviously should have had'.

The hearing was told on January 18, 2011 a meeting was set up between Kelvin and the other three partners where he admitted everything and was suspended as a result.

Counsel to the GMC Elizabeth Nicholls said: 'He admitted to his colleagues and partners that he had a relationship with her and had admitted that the sexual liaisons had taken place in the surgery premises.'

Patient A did not give evidence at the hearing but submitted a letter to the surgery confirming that the relationship had taken place over a two year period.

She said: 'I was very aware that what we were doing was wrong. I have deeply hurt my family and let down my work colleges. It’s something I have to live with, I only hope in time that they will forgive me.'

The hearing was told the woman’s medical appointments with Kelvin had been set late in the day as they would fit in better with her 9-6pm working patterns.

Kelvin’s lawyer Gordon Bebb, defending, said: 'It’s admitted that in relation to patient A, Doctor Kelvin engaged in an improper emotional and sexual relationship, but it is not admitted that he abused his professional position.'

The hearing continues.
