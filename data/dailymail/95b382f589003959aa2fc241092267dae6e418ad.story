Norwegian side Sandefjord have opened the door for controversial striker Ched Evans to join them.

However, the Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for him to play abroad, unless he is successful in the appeal against his rape conviction.

This is due to the terms of his licence, which state Evans needs to meet regularly with their offender manager which would be difficult to do abroad.

Ched Evans has failed to find a football club since his release from prison in October

Evans last played football in a Sheffield United shirt prior to his conviction in April 2012

The 26-year-old is struggling to get a club in England as the adverse publicity and public reaction puts off clubs and sponsors alike.

However, former Nottingham Forest and Derby County midfielder Lars Bohinen is manager of Sandefjord and has confirmed he would give Evans a chance.

Bohinen said: 'I believe that when you have served your sentence, then a person should not be punished anymore. You should not be charged for it later.

'Yes, I would not have any problems [signing Evans if he performed during a trial]. It would be terrible if we would not let convicted people get back into the workforce.'

Talking to Dagbladet, he added: 'In theory, there should not be any issue with the club's sponsors. But the mechanism of football is such that you can quickly become influenced by sponsors today.

'It will cost society more should convicts not go back to a job. If you have you made a mistake there should not be any obstacle [to returning to work].'
