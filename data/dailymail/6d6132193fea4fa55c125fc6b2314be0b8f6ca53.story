Pippa Middleton is poised to follow her sister Kate down the aisle after telling pals that her handsome boyfriend Nico Jackson is ‘the one’.

Friends say Pippa is expected to announce her engagement within months – and is only delaying the news out of deference to Kate, who is due to give birth to her first child later this month.

‘An engagement is definitely on the cards,’ says a close friend of the lovestruck couple.

‘The last time Nico spoke about Pippa to his friends back home in Folkestone, he was totally buzzing about her. He is in his element right now.

‘He has never been happier and this is really what he wants.’

Another source confirmed that banker Nico, 35, is waiting for the excitement surrounding the Royal baby to die down before he pops the question.

The source adds that both Pippa, 29, and Nico are clear about which direction their four-month relationship is going.

‘Pippa has also told her family that Nico is the one,’ says the source.

Party planner-turned-columnist Pippa is preparing to move into Nico’s pad in South Kensington, Central London, leaving behind the Chelsea apartment she shares with brother James.

Meanwhile, Pippa and Nico haven’t been shy about displaying their affection. Last week they were seen canoodling at both a party thrown by The Spectator magazine, for which Pippa is a regular contributor, and again while watching Friday’s thrilling men’s semi-finals at Wimbledon.

Now friends are pondering one burning question: Will Pippa return the favour and ask her sister to be one of her bridesmaids?
