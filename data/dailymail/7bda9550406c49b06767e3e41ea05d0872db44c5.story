A 4-year-old girl is recovering in a Florida hospital after her dad accidentally ran over her on a riding lawnmower.

Makaya Lee playing outside with her older sister in Bowling Green, Florida while their father was cutting the grass shortly before 11:30 a.m. on Friday morning.

As the dad backed up the lawnmower, he accidentally struck the pre-schooler's right leg.

‘I just saw a dad panicking and a little girl panicking and then I saw this baby panicking and I just knew that I had to be strong because I would not have wanted to be in that man's shoes,’ neighbor Wendy Harbarugh, who ran over to help bandage Makaya's wounds, told Fox 13.

A spokeswoman with Hardee County Fire Rescue said the girl's injuries are not life threatening, but are 'very, very severe.'

The girl was flown to Tampa General Hospital, where her condition is said to be ‘fair'. No charges are expected as it appears to have been a freak accident.

Makaya is the second small child run over by a riding lawn mower in the Tampa Bay area in recent months.

In April, two-year-old Ireland Nugent lost both her feet after her father accidentally ran her over. She has since been fitted with prosthetic limbs.

Ireland’s mom Nicole said she's offering her support to Makaya's family.

'I would love to go and just sit with them, cry with them, be with them. We had so much support when we were there. That's what got us through this,' she told Fox 13.

'Not everything is going to go wonderfully, but in the end your daughter will be running, jumping, laughing, playing just like she was before the accident.'
