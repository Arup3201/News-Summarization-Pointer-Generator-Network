Nasa is backing plans to potentially put astronauts in a deep sleep during manned missions to Mars.

The proposal would see a crew ‘hibernate’ for up to 180 days, allowing them to make the journey of 350 million miles (560 million km) with a reduced need for food and water.

The crew would be kept alive through intravenous feeding, before being woken at their destination by inhalation of a coolant gas.

A scientist at the International Astronomical Congress in Toronto has said a 'therapeutic torpor' could make a manned mission to Mars more feasible. Putting a crew into deep sleep means they would need less food and water. Shown here is what the stasis system might look like. An 'arm' helps care for the astronauts

Dr Mark Schaffer from SpaceWorks Enterprises in Atlanta suggested the proposal at the International Astronomical Congress in Toronto last week.

He explained how astronauts could be put in ‘therapeutic torpor’ - a state of reduced physiological activity - to reduce their needs for the 90- to 180-day mission to Mars.

Electrical impulses would stimulate the muscles of the astronauts while hibernating, ensuring that when they woke from their slumber they were not significantly weakened.

To put astronauts in stasis, a system called RhinoChill would be used, which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose.

At a temperature of between 32°C (89°F and 93°F), which takes six hours to reach, the crew would enter stasis. 

Stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination.

This means that on the journey to Mars, they could be placed in a fairly small capsule. 

Therapeutic torpor has been around, in theory, since the 1980s and since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals.

It is not typically used for longer than a week.

This would mean that, en route, the crew could be crammed into a smaller area with less cargo, meaning the spacecraft would not have to be as big as those referenced in other proposals.

‘Therapeutic torpor has been around, in theory, since the 1980s and really since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals,’ said Dr Schaffer, reports Discovery News.

He added: ‘We haven’t had the need to keep someone in [therapeutic torpor] for longer than seven days.

‘For human Mars missions, we need to push that to 90 days, 180 days. 

'Those are the types of mission flight times we’re talking about.’

Torpor reduces the metabolic needs for a human, essentially placing them in 'hibernation'.

To put them in stasis, a system called RhinoChill would be used, which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose. 

Dr Schaffer says  the RhinoChill system, shown here, could put astronauts into a deep sleep. It is currently used to keep patients stable who have gone into cardiac arrest. It involves pumping coolant into their nose to lower their body temperature, decreasing their bodily functions until proper treatment can arrive

Some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin, providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts. In this case the habitat might be a cylinder, shown, with the astronauts on one side to experience the force of gravity

Putting a crew in hibernation means the spacecraft designed to take them there could be smaller (illustration shown), cutting weight requirements from 400 tons to 220 tons. The crew would be put to sleep for the 180-day journey to Mars by lowering their body temperature through their nose

Getting to Mars is difficult due to the vast distances involved.

The distance varies dramatically depending on where Earth and Mars are in their orbits. 

At their closest they are as little as 36 million miles (58 million km) apart, but at their furthest they can be 250 million miles (400 million km).

The way to get to Mars using the minimum energy involves launching in a specific window when the two planets are aligned in such a way that a craft can catch up to the red planet when launched from Earth and enter orbit.

This launch window opens approximately every two years and two months, which is why mission to Mars often launch and arrive at similar times – such as India’s recent Mars orbiter and Nasa’s Maven mission.

The next window opens in April 2018, when Nasa’s next Mars mission – Insight – will launch towards the red planet, while the as-yet unnamed Mars 2020 rover will do the same when the next window opens in July 2020.

At a temperature of between 32°C (89°F and 93°F), which takes six hours to reach, the crew would enter stasis.

Stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination.

This means that on the journey to Mars, they could be placed in a fairly small capsule.

In fact, the study by SpaceWorks suggests it could be five times smaller than a comparable spacecraft in which the astronauts weren't in stasis.

And they would need three times less cargo including food and water to survive.

In total, this could cut the weight requirements of such a mission from 400 tons to about 220 tons.

Upon arriving they would perform the key science of their mission, before being put in stasis again for the journey home.

Some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin, providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts.

An alternative would be to have the crew on hibernation ‘shifts’, with one person staying awake for two or three days before hibernating for 14 days.

More research is needed before the proposal is accepted as a viable option by Nasa. 

In the future, it a crew would go to sleep in Earth orbit - and wake up 180 days later in orbit around the red planet.

The crew will likely be taken to and from a future ship to Mars aboard the Orion spacecraft (illustrated). In December this year Orion will complete its first unmanned test flight. Nasa intends to use it to take humans to an asteroid in the 2020s and to Mars in the 2030s

During interplanetary transit, the crew would receive low-level electrical impulses (illustrated) to key muscle groups to prevent muscles wasting away while in hibernation. An optimal crew size for a mission to Mars may be six people, as seen here, with the future Orion spacecraft likely able to carry a crew of this size

Once they had performed their scientific objects, potentially on the surface (illustration shown), they would be put to sleep again for the return home. The study was backed by Nasa but the agency has not yet decided if it will use such a technique on future manned missions to Mars or not
