From the lack of leg room to annoying reclining seats, the frustrations for plane passengers travelling long-haul in economy class seats have been well documented.

So one award-winning designer is taking it into his own hands to encourage airlines to improve comfort for travellers.

James Lee, who has won accolades for his forward-thinking concepts, has revealed his plans for new long-haul seats with Hong Kong-based company Paperclip Design.

The new-look plane seats would have reclining backrests - that don't bump into the passenger sitting behind

Multi-function: The new tray table would double-up as a tablet holder, large enough to fit an iPad

Future concept: James Lee's designs would see economy planes equipped with dual-use armrests

And those travelling on a budget will welcome the new-look, as it's designed with economy passengers in mind.

As well as seats with a reclining backrest and a tray with a tablet stand, holidaymakers will also be able to relax on flights with a footrest under the chair in front of them.

Potentially spelling the end to elbow wars among travellers sitting next to each other, Lee's Meerkat seat concept also includes a dual-use armrest.

End of elbow wars? The new-look seats would have a dual-use armrest which passengers could share

Comfort: James Lee's Meerkat concept includes a footrest for passengers travelling economy class

The design allows both passengers to use it - with a raised front so that space isn't restricted and that neighbours' arms don't touch.

The sleeper backrest seats offer an alternative to traditional recliner mode to allow passengers to relax - and could mean the end to passengers' knees being crushed.

The lower portion of the backrest cushion detaches, pushing the traveller forward in a 'deep recline' position, allowing them to stretch their legs out in front.

And the tablet stand works when the tray is locked in a half-open position, with enough room to support an iPad or tablet on the grooves in the edge of the stand.

Future design: The cup holder on planes would be separate to the tray, meaning tables could be stowed away

Seats would have compartments for sunglasses and water bottles - taking away the full-width seat pocket

Entertainment: The dual-use armrest would feature a hook for headphones - making them easier to stow away

Lee's design plans also include a fixed cup holder - meaning the tray could be stowed away - a personal cabinet below the table, replacing the seat pocket, and a box footrest - in which airlines could store electronics.

The designer, who has won various prices in the travel industry, said he also sought to address airline's cost concerns when compiling the concept.

Explaining the design, the website said: 'The Meerkat is a concept design for long haul economy class seating that enhances passenger experience while minimising weight and maintenance costs.

'Passengers today are far more focused on comfort. 

'However, airlines need to balance costs with fancy facilities. Weight reduction is especially critical since it has a direct bearing on the amount of fuel consumed particularly on long flights.

'The Meerkat seeks to satisfy both sides. 

'It introduces a number of innovative features with minimal weight and complexity. The Meerkat is a seat for passengers as well as a seat for airlines.'

Versatile: James Lee hopes that his design will be incorporated into both aircraft and trains

Other designs by Lee were unveiled at this year's influential Aircraft Interiors Expo, held in Hamburg in northern Germany.

The imaginative ‘Caterpillar Convertible’ seat – which has already won awards thanks to its versatility - was also mooted.

Futuristic and flexible, the Caterpillar can be both a cheaper seating option in the economy cabin – or can be reconfigured as something rather more exclusive in business class, with the capacity to spread out as a flat bed.

And Lee has won awards for his two-teared armrest and now, after patenting the product in the UK and US, he is hoping the idea will catch on for planes, trains and even cinemas.
