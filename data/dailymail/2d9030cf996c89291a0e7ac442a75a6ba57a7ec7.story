Climate scientists have backed Britain’s shale gas revolution – saying it could help to slow  global warming.

The world’s leading experts on climate change say fracking will cut greenhouse gas emissions and should be made central to the country’s energy production.

It will help the UK move away from ‘dirty’ coal and contribute to saving the environment, according to a report by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps CO2. A young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by Cuadrilla Resources

The report says it is ‘quite clear’ that fracking is ‘very consistent with low-carbon development’ and the technology could ‘significantly’ reduce emissions.

The unexpected endorsement from 235 eminent United Nations scientists and economists will be a welcome boost to David Cameron, who is a keen advocate of the new technology.

It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking.

The IPCC report, published yesterday in Berlin, says natural gas has a role to play for at least the next 35 years as a ‘bridge technology’ while the UK expands its use of wind and solar power.

And it says shale may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond that if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground.

The scientists say that wind, solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled.

But natural gas – whether drilled from conventional wells or extracted from fractured shale deep below the ground – also has a role because it emits roughly half the volume of greenhouse gases as coal.

Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chairman of the IPCC authors, said: ‘The shale gas revolution can be very consistent with low-carbon development – that is quite clear. It can be very helpful as a bridge technology.’

The IPCC document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change.

It will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally-binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions.

Britain is thought to have vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that can be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture rock.

Mr Cameron last month said he wanted shale gas wells to be up and running by the end of the year, although industry sources say commercial extraction is not likely until the end of the decade.

But there have been fierce protests against the technique, with exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators.

The IPCC report is the third of three it has prepared on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change.

The first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming.

The second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring’ across the world.

Yesterday’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken.

It calls for massive investment in low-carbon alternatives worldwide of around £90billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground.

Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but says ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers’.

Last year in Britain, coal provided 36 per cent of electricity, gas provided 27 per cent, nuclear 20 per cent, oil 1 per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent.
