The last time Liverpool were due at the Bernabeu it was 2009 and Real Madrid’s interim president Vicente Boluda predicted a 3-0 win live on Spanish radio.

He said Madrid would ‘blow Liverpool away’ and he even threw in a ‘2-1 away victory’ prediction for the second leg.

Rafa Benitez’ Reds won 5-0 on aggregate; Boluda and Madrid were humiliated.

As Liverpool land in the Spanish capital on Monday, five years on from that most impressive of European scalps, there is no need for any arrogant predictions from their opponents.

Loose talk has been replaced by the sort of quiet confidence 11 straight wins (including a 3-0 victory at Anfield) tend to breed.

You won’t find any Real Madrid players, coaches or directors calling the game with such contempt for the opposition, but a big home win is exactly what many of them are quietly expecting.

Ronaldo has scored four more league goals for Real this season than Liverpool have managed

Carlo Ancelotti's men have won 11 on the trot, including seven straight wins in the league

 Liverpool have scored 13 league goals so far this season – that is four less than Ronaldo has managed on his own.

Real Madrid’s interim president Vicente Boluda predicted a 3-0 win in 2009; They lost both legs

After brushing aside Liverpool a fortnight ago Real beat Barcelona to move within one point of them, and this weekend they climbed above them in the table, going top, with another easy 4-0 away win that had Iker Casillas asking after the game if perhaps this was the greatest Madrid side he had played in.

Real were always going to be a difficult proposition for Liverpool in Champions League Group B, but when they lost away to Real Sociedad earlier in the campaign – a club currently one off the bottom and with a recently sacked manager – it was a glimmer of hope for the Reds that perhaps their summer spending spree had unsettled the balance established last season.

Carlo Ancelotti has ironed out the rough spots in record time however and Madrid are now playing better than at any time under the Italian’s management. 

Gareth Bale’s enforced absence has actually aided that process with a midfield quartet of James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco all on the same wavelength in a midfield that keeps the ball as well as Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona did.

'We don’t want to be compared with anyone. We have our own philosophy,' said Modric when asked about that very comparison on Sunday. 

Madrid are perhaps still slightly more direct than that great Barcelona side and a fraction more goal-hungry too.

If they continue at the current scoring rate they will finish the season with 140 goals with almost 70 of them coming from the boots and head of Ronaldo, who is ready to run riot again against Liverpool’s shaky rearguard.

It was Madrid that were shaky five years ago. They were passing through moments of great instability with Juande Ramos briefly replacing Bernd Schuster as coach and the aforementioned Boluda even more briefly replacing Ramos Calderon as president.

Ramos had pulled things together with seven straight wins in the league but Boluda’s confidence was very misplaced, especially against a Rafa Benitez team that had Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres both in their pomp.

Real Madrid have a good chance of avenging that 5-0 aggregate defeat five years ago

'It’s easy for him to say because he will be watching the game from directors' box; he won’t be on the pitch,' said then Madrid player Arjen Robben of Boluda’s unhelpful comments. 

'There are no easy games' said Ramos before he watched his side lose the first leg to a Yossi Benayoun goal and the second at Anfield to a Gerrard double, a Torres strike and another from Andrea Dossena.

With the Anfield meeting already behind them – and won at such a canter – Real Madrid supporters can’t wait for Tuesday night. 

The Sunday papers all carried sizeable match reports from Liverpool’s defeat at Newcastle. There has never been a better time to avenge that 5-0 aggregate scoreline from five years ago.
