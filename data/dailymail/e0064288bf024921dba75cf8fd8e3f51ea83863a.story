The man known as the ‘Lotto Rapist’ has been pictured walking in the countryside with his girlfriend after buying a luxury new home in the form of a converted church.

Iorworth Hoare, 62, became notorious when he won £7.2million on the lottery in 2004 after buying a ticket on day release from prison while serving a sentence for rape.

Now he has paid £440,000 for an isolated five-bedroom home in Northumberland and is living there with former policeman’s wife Karen Cameron, 51, and their two dogs, it has been reported.

The ‘attractive and unique’ house dates from 1790 and is said to retain period features with modern fixtures and fittings, an ‘enclosed private garden’ and rooms ‘full of character’. He bought it in July.

Hoare began a relationship with Miss Cameron six years ago after hiring her as a cleaning lady on £6.50 an hour, reported journalists Nick Warbuton and Nick Doman in the Sunday People. 

The mother-of-two was claimed to have told her daughter six years ago that Hoare was a 'total gentleman' who 'makes me laugh and smile in a way that I haven't done for years'.

Three years ago he has put his mansion at the exclusive Darras Hall estate outside Newcastle up for sale at a knockdown price after the words 'leave or die' were spray-painted on the gates.

Rapist: Since his release from prison, Hoare (pictured in 2007) has faced a catalogue of abuse and threats

Hoare bought the six-bedroom detached house for £700,000 following his release from a life sentence in 2005. But in 2011 he was forced to put it up for sale for a bargain price of £595,000.

Since his release from prison, Hoare, originally from Seacroft, Leeds, has faced a catalogue of abuse and threats, most notably eight years ago when he received silver bullets through the post.

Market trader Peter Oates, of Brixton, south London, was found guilty of threatening to kill the jackpot winner and was jailed indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court in December 2006.

In 2008, Hoare tried to get access to his fortune so he could leave the country and set up home in France. However he was restricted to £8,666 a month as part of the conditions of his release.

Hoare was jailed for life in 1989 for attempting to rape a 59-year-old woman in a Leeds park. He already had six previous convictions for rape and other sex offences.
