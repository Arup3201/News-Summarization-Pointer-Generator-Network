A review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made.

Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way so-called ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run.

Critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA's Hyde Park bombing in 1982.

David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK.

In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young.

Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace.

But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court.

The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Tony Blair's Labour government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities.

Lady Justice Hallett said the scheme was not well publicised, and effectively kept 'below the radar', but was not secret. 'The administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty,' she said. 'Suspected terrorists were not handed a 'get out of jail free card'.'

But shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made. They included:

The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year.

Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters.

Democratic Unionist First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when Mr Cameron ordered the review.

A police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked, though only by intelligence, to 295 murders during the Troubles.

Today Mr Robinson said the scheme was ‘wrong in principle and shambolic in practice’.

He added: ‘Of course it was a get out of jail free card for Downey.

'It has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that Lady Justice Hallett refers to as in error, it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out.

‘And indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge.’

Northern Ireland's most senior police officer said it was 'highly unlikely' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases.

Chief constable George Hamilton said he accepted Lady Justice Hallett's findings and apologised to the Hyde Park victims.

He said: 'The difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place.'

He added: 'If they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application (to collapse the case) would be successful as it was in the Downey case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it.'

Under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein, before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status.

A report on each individual was sent back to the Government and, if they were declared as not being wanted, a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals.

In the Commons today, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'I know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity (Hyde Park) and I apologise again on behalf of this Government for any hurt that has caused.'

She added: 'I fully accept the Hallett Report's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the Government will act on them.

'But, as I have said before, as far as this Government is concerned, the OTR scheme is over.'

For
 more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park 
hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.

The use of an incorrect date of birth to search a police database may have missed an offence potentially linked to an individual. An individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist offence. It has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance.

@highlight

An individual who was wanted for an offence committed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted. The origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police believed they were only searching for pre-1998 offences and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 offence when informing the Northern Ireland Office that the individual was 'not wanted by the PSNI'.

Tuesday July 20, 1982
 - IRA Hyde Park bombing. A Morris Marina car containing 20-25 pounds of
 explosives with wire nails as shrapnel is left in South Carriage Drive.
 It killed four soldiers as they rode through the park to the changing 
of the guard. The explosion injured other members of the Royal Household
 Cavalry and killed seven horses as they travelled from their barracks 
to Buckingham Palace. An artist's impression of a suspect is released by
 the police.

over the bombing. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard prepares to seek his 
extradition largely based on fingerprint evidence on parking tickets.

and decides the finger print evidence is not compelling enough to seek 
extradition.

From July 1998
 - as part of the extended negotiations between the British government, 
Sinn Fein, and the Northern Ireland government, the names of 187 On The 
Runs (OTRs) - including Downey - can be submitted by Sinn Fein for 
checks whether they are wanted by authorities in Northern Ireland or in 
the UK.

@highlight

2001 - the UK makes a commitment not to pursue those who might benefit from early release schemes.

July 20, 2007
 - Downey, 62, of County Donegal, receives a ‘letter of assurance’ that 
he is not wanted in Northern Ireland or the UK when in fact there is an 
outstanding warrant against him in the UK. The letter is sent by the 
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on behalf of the secretary of 
state for Northern Ireland and the attorney general. The letter 
reassures Downey that he can visit his son and grandchild in Canada. He 
also travels several times to the UK and Northern Ireland.

@highlight

2008 -
 a chain of emails between two PSNI officers indicates that the PSNI 
knew that Downey was wanted over the Hyde Park bombing by the 
Metropolitan Police and that this was not mentioned in the 2007 letter. In
 the summer, before travelling with his wife to Canada, Downey contacts 
the Canadian authorities for a temporary residence permit. He says: ‘The
 reason for the above application is that I served a term of 
imprisonment in Portlaoise prison in the Irish Republic in 1974...I was 
named in some British newspapers as being responsible for the Hyde Park 
& Regents Park bombings in 1982, which I strenuously deny. No 
warrant was ever issued by the British authorities to have me extradited
 and I understand from contacts which have taken place between British 
and Sinn Fein that they, the British, have no further interest in me. I 
have strongly supported the peace process from the very beginning of the
 talks and I believe that the only way forward for all people on the 
island of Ireland north and south is in peaceful co-operation and mutual
 respect and understanding for each other...’ The application is 
granted.

2009 -
 Downey visits Londonderry and Belfast in his role to promote greater

May 19, 2013
 - Downey is arrested at Gatwick Airport en route to Greece. He 
allegedly told police: ‘I am surprised that this had come up as I have 
travelled in and out of the UK on a number of occasions to see family 
and I have travelled to Canada from Dublin. When I went to Canada I 
contact the UK government to check it would be OK as I didn't want any 
problems. They said that would be fine.’ He is subsequently charged over
 the murder of four British soldiers and causing an explosion.

@highlight

January 2014
 - a trial date is listed at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Sweeney. 
Instead, Downey's defence team launch an 11th hour bid for the case to 
be thrown out due to an ‘abuse of process’.

@highlight

February 2014 -
 Trial judge Mr Justice Sweeney throws out the case because of the PSNI 
error in sending the letter and not correcting the false impression it 
gives Downey. The final ruling was handed down on Friday February 21 but
 could not be reported until the prosecution had decided in discussion 
with the Attorney General not to appeal.
