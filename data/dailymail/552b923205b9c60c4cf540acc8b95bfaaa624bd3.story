Comic Con 2014 came to a close on Sunday but what a fun couple of days it was for the attendees who dressed in their finest costumes over the four day event at the Jacob Javits Center in New York.

The event, which kicked off last Thursday, attracted some 150,000 people – many donning elaborate and often skimpy – costumes in homage to their comic book favorites.

Sunday saw guest appearances from William Shatner and Hulk Hogan among the screenings, panels and book signings at the biggest event in the comic book aficionado's calendar.

Comic Con 2014 came to a close on Sunday but what a fun couple of days it was for the attendees - many of who dressed in their finest for the four day event at the Jacob Javits Center in New York

Comic Con 2014 kicked off last Thursday and was  attended by more than 150,000 people – many donning elaborate, often skimpy – costumes in homage to their comic book favorites

One of the more bizarre costumes photographed at Comic Con on Sunday was Bill Cipher, left, from Disney's Gravity Falls, while more familiar characters included the X Men's Kitty Pryde and  Iceman, right

From midday on each day of the five day extravaganza, streams of men, women and children - some still in pushchairs – have streamed into the exhibition room dressed as characters from movies, books, and video games. 

This year's event also included 800 exhibitors, 400 panels and 600 artist signings. There was even a faction of people protesting against Ben Affleck being cast as Batman in a 2016 comic movie: Batman v Superman.

As ever, numerous women came scantily clad like their favorite characters - some wore little more than panties and tape.

It is a controversial issue that has plagued the event for years as many cosplayers complain they are fondled and intrusive photos are taken of them and later posted on the internet.

In a bid to tackle the controversy, organizers this year hung posters warning people that 'cosplay does not mean consent', that they should keep their hands to themselves, and ask for permission before taking photos.

For many attendees, Comic Con isn't all about the famous names and exclusive previews but is also a chance to dress up as your favorite comic book character and ham it up with the other visitors. Pictured, Catwoman and Uncharted's Nathan Drake

Costumes at the annual event can range from the very traditional, see Little Red Riding Hood left, to the cutting edge and futuristic

Cosplay is a combination of the words 'costume' and 'play'. The term is believed to have been first coined by a Japanese journalist who attended the 1984 World-Con science fiction convention and returned home not knowing what to call the elaborate costumes

Nine years after the event started, it has become a major boost for the local and national economy.

It started with just 20,000 ticket-holders and 25,000 square feet of exhibits. This year’s New York Comic Con sold 150,000 tickets, covers 200,000 square feet and boasts 2,000 speakers and presenters.

Last year, New York Comic Con generated more than $70 million, according to the New York Times, and tickets sold out within minutes for the event.

It has even spurned a secondary ticket market, with people selling their entry passes online for triple the price.

According to Alex Fensterman, the creator, New York Comic Con is 'a reflection of New York City' and, compared to the unaffiliated San Diego version, 'a little bit less Hollywood focused, a little bit more comic book, publishing, television focused.'

Fans were treated to a surprise at the presentation of Tomorrowland when George Clooney crashed the event on Thursday. Other highlights over the weekend included actor Bill Nye signing autographs for fans and a panel featuring the creators and actors from AMC's Walking Dead.

Fans can also shop for collectibles.

Digg compiled the most valuable items for sale, including the highest-valued comic, the first Action Comics issue held by Bryan Menegus, valued over $3million.
