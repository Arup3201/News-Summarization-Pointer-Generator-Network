Berry, who began working at Jenesse 15 years ago, said she was just five years old when she witnessed her father, Jerome Berry, abusing her mother, Judith Hawkins, according to E! Online.

She said that she watched her mother get 'kicked down stairs' and saw her get hit in the head with a wine bottle.

'Knowing that she wanted nothing more than for her little girls to see her be empowered and be a woman of strength, but having no way to make that happen was heartbreaking for me,' Berry said during her speech. 

The abuse went on through Berry's childhood, Berry said: 'She stayed for too long and her children, my sister and I, saw far too much and I've suffered the damage of being a child of domestic violence.'

'The reason I say this organization is my heart and soul is because I understand the good that it does and the lives that it changes and the impact it has on women and the children in our community,' she added.

In interviews over the years, Berry has alleged her late father was a violent alcoholic who beat her mother in front of her and sister.

In a 2009 interview, Berry said: 'I saw my mother battered, and could not do anything to stop it.

'My father was tyrannical, lashing out at her for no reason. I felt the effects that had on our family - I’ve experienced what these women have gone through.' 

Berry has been in an ongoing custody battle over her daughter Nahla with her former boyfriend, Canadian model Gabriel Aubry, since they split in 2010.

Though they have joint custody over Nahla, in November 2014, Berry hauled Aubry before a judge accusing him of chemically lightening and straightening the child's curly, brunette locks.

Berry, who became the first African American woman to win an Academy Award, also accused Gabriel of making racial slurs against her.

In her testimony, Berry said: 'I continue to worry about the potential psychological and physical damage to Nahla that can be caused by the use of chemical hair treatments and the psychological message that it conveys to Nahla, and to implore the court to put a stop to Gabriel's attempts to alter our daughter's appearance and most probably cause her to wonder why her natural appearance is not good enough.' 

The mother-of-two was being honored with the Creative Conscience Award at Thursday's gala. 

Amy Poehler, Pink, Ewan McGregor, Aaron Paul and his wife Lauren Parsekian, Christina Applegate, Josh Hutcherson and Zendaya were also honored for their charitable work.
