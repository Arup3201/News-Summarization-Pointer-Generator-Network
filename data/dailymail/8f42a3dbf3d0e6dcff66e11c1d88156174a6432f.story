It certainly beats throwing another prawn on the barbie.

Diners with a taste for the exotic can now hop down to Lidl and stock up on kangaroo steaks.

The budget supermarket claims roo meat, which it introduced last month, is both nutritious and inexpensive.

But animal welfare campaigners are furious and insist the trade in kangaroos is cruel.

New tastes:Budget supermarket chain Lidl claims kangaroo meat is both nutritious and inexpensive

A Lidl ‘Deluxe’ 300g pack of two steaks costs £3.99, while the equivalent weight of lean fillet beef steak costs up to £9.

The number of wild kangaroos has surged in recent years and many Australians see them as a pest because they damage crops.

As
a result, mass culls are expected to slaughter almost six million this 
year, a huge increase on the two million killed in 2011.

Many of the shot animals will end up on supermarket shelves in Britain.

But
wildlife campaigners Viva say the cull is cruel and have urged shoppers
to boycott kangaroo meat and lobby Lidl to get them to stop selling it.

Its
campaigns manager, Justin Kerswell, said: ‘Lidl are making a cheap buck
by selling dead wildlife to misguided, thrill-seeking customers.

‘The
novelty value of so-called “exotic meats” pales when you take into 
account the suffering and sheer destruction this unsustainable business 
causes. Kangaroos are not farmed, they are wild animals that are hunted 
and shot at night in the vast outback away from the scrutiny of the 
public.

‘What makes this 
vile trade even worse are the hundreds of thousands of little victims, 
the baby and adolescent joeys. Pouch young will be pulled from their 
dying mother and smashed about the head.’

However
Lidl insisted that the meat was popular and healthy, while it rejected 
allegations of  cruelty. A spokesman said: ‘The kangaroo steaks have 
sold phenomenally well.

‘They
are considered a very healthy alternative to red meats – they possess 
many nutritious benefits such as being low in cholesterol and fat and 
are high in protein, iron, zinc and conjugated linoleic acid, which has 
antioxidant properties and can reduce blood pressure.’

‘We take animal welfare very seriously and only source products that meet high standards of food safety and hygiene.

‘Over 75 per cent of the commercial kangaroo harvest are male animals. Kangaroo meat is sold in virtually all Australian supermarkets and to thousands of restaurants and is not regarded as a “novelty meat”.’
