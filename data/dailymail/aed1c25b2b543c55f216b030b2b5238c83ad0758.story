Tragic end: After a 12-day multistate search, missing Nadia Malik, 22, was found dead in her car illegally parked on a Philadelphia street

Police say the body of a missing 22-year-old woman from suburban Philadelphia has been found inside a parked car near the city's 30th Street Station.

Authorities identified the woman as Nadia Malik, of Marple Township. She was last seen on February 9 and was the subject of a multistate search.

Police said the body was found just after 12pm Thursday in one of the front seats of her black Nissan.

According to investigators, Malik was slumped over with a pile of books on top of her.

Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker told NBC10 the vehicle had been parked along 30th Street for nearly two weeks and had multiple parking tickets tucked under the windshield.

The 2007 Nissan Altima was covered with snow from the recent winter storms most of the time it was in the location where it was discovered today following a tip from a caller who had recognized the vehicle from media reports.

Police said the car's heavily tinted windows also made it more difficult to see the interior. 

Lt Walker said Malik's body showed no visible signs of trauma. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. 

Law enforcement officials are awaiting extradition of 25-year-old Bhupinder Singh, Malik's boyfriend, with whom she has two young daughters.

Singh has been in custody in Ohio since February 12, when he was detained by police for probation violations in Delaware County, as well as for questioning in Malik's disappearance. He has not been charged in her death.

Malik's friend Thomas Singh, no relation to her boyfriend, told police that during a phone conversation with the 22-year-old, the woman allegedly told him that she was with her boyfriend and 'he wasn't letting her go,' The Delaware County Daily Times reported. 

One of Malik's five siblings spoke to Singh around the time of his sister's disappearance.

Detective Kurt Lindelow said the brother heard Malik scream in the background before the phone cut off.

When police tracked down Singh to his parents' home in Solon, Ohio, the man claimed that he and Malik had a fight and he left her in the car back in Pennsylvania before boarding a Greyhound bus in New York.

Since 2008, Singh has had two convictions for DUI incidents and one for making terroristic threats stemming from a June 2010 confrontation with a 7-Eleven clerk.
