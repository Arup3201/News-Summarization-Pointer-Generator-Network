An emotional Marussia team will decide on Thursday whether to replace the stricken Jules Bianchi for this weekend’s Russian Grand Prix or leave his car empty as a mark of respect.

With Bianchi’s condition remaining critical but stable after his horrific crash at last Sunday’s race in Japan, a sense of normality has yet to return to the British-based team.

Marussia’s reserve driver, Alexander Rossi, travelled to Sochi on Wednesday night and could make his Formula One race debut in Bianchi’s place.

The 23-year-old, who has driven in practice for Caterham, has a superlicence that would allow him to slot straight in but some within the team would prefer they race only one car, that of Britain’s Max Chilton. Whether the rules allow that is unclear.

There is also the question of how their owner, Andrey Cheglakov, views the situation going into the first Formula One race to be staged in Russia.

The race is likely to see the grand prix community united in sympathy. Ferrari, who schooled Bianchi - he remains on their young driver programme - will carry the words ‘Forza Jules’ on their car.

The FIA embarrassingly included John Booth, the Marussia team principal, on their press conference list even though he is still in Japan at Bianchi’s bedside.

Lewis Hamilton, who won in Japan to extend his championship lead over Nico Rosberg to 10 points, said on Wednesday: ‘I was pleased to have finally won at Suzuka, but as soon as we heard what happened to Jules it suddenly didn’t seem relevant anymore. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.’
