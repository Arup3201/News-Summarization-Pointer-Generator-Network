The scene is all too familiar.

Semi-clad teenagers tanked up on cheap booze, staggering around the streets wild-eyed and delirious, or draped over a bench, surrounded by empty alcohol bottles and fast-food cartons.

But maybe not so much this year.

So last year? New figures shows 2014 schoolies are turning their back on traditional locations and behaviour 

Holiday company Student Flights has announced that this year's schoolies are looking to venture further afield, with many shunning the usual locations for more exotic destnations.

The most popular locations have traditionally been the Gold Coast, Byron Bay and Airlie Beach.

But competitive rates means they can have now enjoy a richer cultural experience overseas at a fraction of the cost.

As well as exclusive small-group  holidays like sailing, bookings to Bali and Thailand are higher than ever.

Schoolies-only resorts in places like Vanuatu and Fiji are also up, between 40 and 50 per cent on last year.

And it appears some of the estimated 60,000 school-leavers are budding philanthropists, with bookings to volunteer in places such as Africa, Cambodia and Sri Lanka up 120 per cent.

The budget holiday company's General Manager, Darren Lloyd, says the reason the record number of schoolies are heading overseas this year is purely financial.

He told The Australian Asia is seen as cheap, easy and convenient and that, 'parents are more invested and happy to pay for their school leaver to go on a group tour as their end of school present.'

On its Facebook page Student Flight quips, 'Bali may be cheap but it doesn't have to be nasty. Read how not to be a bogan in Bali.'

Schoolies.com is another popular tour operator and has been the central booking site for Schoolies Week for more than 26 years,  arranging holidays for approximately 30,000 teens each year.

Its CEO Matt Lloyd also claims about 80 per cent of school-leavers around Australia now organise a special trip or memorable holiday for their graduation compared to around 35 per cent 20 years ago.

He says students are more organised than ever and they sometimes book their trips a year or two in advance so they make sure they get exactly what and where they want.

Schoolies Week is a three week graduation festival celebrated by Year 12 school leavers all over Australia and celebrations take place during the first 3 weeks following graduation in mid November.
