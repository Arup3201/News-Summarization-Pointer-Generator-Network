A mother left devastated by the death of her grown-up son 10 years ago has had another baby - aged 60.

Galina Hrustaev gave birth to little Cleopatra by Cesarean section at the Filatov Hospital in the Russian capital Moscow, and has since been proudly been showing off the little girl on social media.

But she has so far refused to say whether she had any help conceiving - despite the fact there has only been one recorded case of a woman getting pregnant naturally over the aged of 60.

Record: Galina, seen here with husband Alexey and baby Cleopatra, is thought to be Russia's oldest mother

Galina's motivation to have another child was sparked by the tragic loss of her son a decade ago.

Her husband Alexey, meanwhile, has a 27-year-old daughter from his first marriage. 

'The main thing is that I tragically lost my son of 29 years from my first marriage just when he was in the prime of life,' she revealed.

'Afterwards I felt an incredible desire to have another child, even though it was so late in life, and I have now fulfilled that desire.'

Galina, who did not say how her son had died, said that she was now devoting all of her efforts to spending time with Cleopatra, who was born weighing just over six pounds.

Alexey told Russian media they were both delighted with the new arrival - and others seem to be just as happy. 

Her close friend Faina Sukhorukova posted on her Facebook page: 'I know that you always said you wanted another baby, but I never knew that you really meant it. 

'I've always admired your determination, congratulations. I know you will be a perfect mother.'

Natural?: The couple have so far refused to reveal whether or not they used IVF to conceive the child

It is thought Galina may be the oldest woman in Russia to ever give birth.

However, the oldest woman in the world to give birth was Omkari Singh, who gave birth to twins aged 70 iIn 2008.

In 2013, she revealed she was struggling to raise the boys, due to her age.

Britain's oldest mother is Elizabeth Adeney, who gave birth to a boy in 2009 when she was 66.
