Fidel Castro has made a rare public appearance after he voted in the country's parliamentary elections.

Millions of Cubans joined the 86-year-old former leader of Cuba to vote in what critics have branded a 'closed' election that offers no real competition.

The revolutionary icon, who appears in public only occasionally now since he fell ill in 2006, was among those voting in Havana yesterday.

Government critics call Cuban elections perfunctory, noting that only the Communist Party is permitted on the island

The government has defended the process, saying it is a show of grass-roots democracy.

Authorities say the lack of multiple 
parties or political campaigning keeps corruption and special-interest 
money out of elections, and point to high turnout as proof that it's a 
participatory system.

The elected unicameral legislature will meet on February 24 and pick a new parliament chief for the first time in two decades, with the body's longtime leader, Ricardo Alarcon, not on the ballot.

The body is also expected to rename Raul Castro, whom state TV showed casting his ballot in the eastern province of Santiago, as president for another five years.

Voting began last October with municipal elections.

Term limits do not exist in Cuba, but on various occasions Castro has proposed limiting public officials including the president to two consecutive periods in office.

Castro, who now appears in public only occasionally after his illness, was among more than 8 million islanders eligible to vote

Castro and his younger brother Raul have headed up the government for five decades

Government critics call Cuban elections perfunctory, noting that only the Communist Party is permitted on the island and only one approved candidate is on the ballot for each seat in parliament.

Castro and his older brother Fidel, now retired, have headed up the government for five decades.

Parliamentary candidates don't need to belong to the Communist Party, but those who don't generally are members of allied organizations.

After casting his ballot at a school in an upscale neighborhood of western Havana,Â  Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez 'It is a different electoral system.

'Personally I find it is more democratic than (others) I know.'

More than 8 million islanders are eligible to vote, and will approve 612 members of the National Assembly and over 1,600 provincial delegates.

The government said turnout in 2008, when the last parliamentary election was held, was 96.8 percent.

'I come to vote of my own volition with the hope that we will see the delegates and representatives do their job, that they don't just get comfortable, that we see improvement,' said Arnaldo Herrera, a 54-year-old electrician, at a polling site in historic Old Havana.

'They need to do something, for example fix buildings that have problems. Some of them are falling down,' Mr Herrera added.

'People need to feel satisfied by what they do.'

Castro's appearance will quell rumours 
about his health, as whispers that the former Cuban leader has died or 
is near death have circulated repeatedly for years

Castro's health is considered a matter of national security in Cuba and few details are released.
