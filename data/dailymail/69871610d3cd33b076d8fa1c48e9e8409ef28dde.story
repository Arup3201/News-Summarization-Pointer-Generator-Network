Vladimir Putin has branded America a nation which 'wants to control everything' during a scathing verbal attack on the U.S.

The Russian Premier said the USA is seeking to dominate the world and interfere with the internal matters of other countries.

Mr Putin also said America was being 'uncooperative' with Europe and Russia over Washington plans for a missile defence system.

Attack: Mr Putin, pictured today chairing a Cabinet meeting in Moscow, said he thinks they 'sometimes do not want allies'

Speaking during a Russian election campaign stopover in Siberia, Mr Putin said: 'They want to control everything.

'Sometimes I have the impression that the United States does not want allies, and instead that it needs vassals.'

His outspoken criticism of the US 'foreign policy doctrine' came ahead of a demand for tougher controls on foreigners flouting immigration rules in Russia.

Both blasts are seen as the strongman seeking to bolster his core support in the face of opposition rallies calling on him to quit. He remains the clear favourite to grab back the job he left in 2008 as Kremlin president.

Turning his sights on strains over Washington's plans for a missile defence system on the continent, he said: 'They are not prepared to co-operate on equal terms either with Europe or us.

'Co-operation on equal terms means determining threats together and working out a system of response to them together. They flatly reject that.'

Mr Putin also shared strong views on foreigners who are flouting immigration rules in Russia

He sneered at US tactics in seeking to influence other countries by arguing 'that you do not meet certain standards.

'They work out these standards themselves.'

He warned against Western countries seeking to hold sway in Russia by funding organisations with political missions.

'This just not be allowed to happen,' he said.

But he vowed to listen to protesters who accused him of vote rigging and leading a corrupt government.

'The authorities must respond and listen, no matter what they say and how abusive their language may be. It's indecent, but all the same we must listen to them,' he said.

However, he vowed to prevent foreign governments exploiting the opposition for 'their own foreign policy goals with regard to our country'.

Putin yesterday proposed a crackdown on immigration for those flouting rules.

He has also called for migrants to pass language, history and law tests .

And he promised to punish people running 'slave labour' rackets in Russia.
