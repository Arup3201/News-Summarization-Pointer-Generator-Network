Small change: Christoffel Wiese, worth £3billion, had been on his way to Luxembourg with the cash

A billionaire who was discovered 
leaving the country with nearly £700,000 in his luggage has won back the
cash from the UK Border Agency.

Dr Christoffel Wiese, South Africa's 
third richest man, was carrying £674,920 in used bank notes in his 
suitcases at London City Airport as he checked in for a flight to 
Luxembourg.

Officials siezed the supermarket 
baron's cash and a district judge later ordered its forfeiture, saying 
it was probably derived from criminal money laundering.

However, the High Court has now 
ordered UKBA to hand back the money, ruling it 'unlikely' such a 
fabulously wealthy man would muddy his hands with anything of the sort.

Dr Wiese - who is aged in his 
seventies and worth an estimated £3billion - is the largest single 
shareholder in Africa's Shoprite supermarket chain and has investments 
in mining and wine companies, according to Forbes.

He was stopped by border officers in 
April 2009 when a security check found £120,000 in his hand luggage and a
further search unearthed more than £500,000 in two bags he had checked 
into the hold, the judge said.

Dr Wiese told officers at the time the
money came from decades-old 'diamond deals' and had been kept in a 
safety deposit box at London's Ritz hotel.

He had been on his way to Luxembourg, a
financial jurisdiction noted for its secrecy and light tax regime, 
where he said he intended to invest the money and return to London the 
same day.

A district judge ordered the 
forfeiture of the money in 2010 finding that 'on the balance of 
probabilities' the cash came from criminal money laundering.

Challenging that decision, Dr Wiese's 
barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, said the cash was not very much to a man
who earns £25million-a-year and represented only a 'minute fraction' of
his fortune.

Suspicions aroused: Customs officials found £120,000 in Dr Wiese's hand luggage as he went to board a flight at London City Airport and more than £500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold, the High Court heard

Mr Justice Underhill revoked the 
district judge's order, ruling it was 'unreasonable' to force Dr Wiese, 
who has an entirely clean criminal record, to give up the money.

The judge said: 'It is unlikely that a
businessman of previous good character, already enormously rich from 
legitimate business, would become involved in money laundering.

'The fact is that the court was told 
absolutely nothing which rendered it likely that Dr Wiese was engaged in
money laundering, save for the fact of his possession and attempt to 
take out of the country a very large sum of used notes.

'As to that, there was an explanation which, although not credited, was plausible and, in my judgment, more plausible.'

He added: 'It may be, in cases where 
people are found carrying large sums of cash at the airport, that there 
will be circumstances, including their refusal to explain their conduct 
or lies told about the origin and purpose of the cash, which will render
an inference that the cash was obtained by money laundering legitimate.

'But, in the present case, there were no such circumstances and an entirely plausible alternative explanation was put forward.'

UKBA will now have to return the seized cash, along with interest accrued on it over the past three years.

However, the judge refused to order 
the agency to pay Dr Wiese's legal costs, finding that he 'brought this 
state of affairs on himself'.
