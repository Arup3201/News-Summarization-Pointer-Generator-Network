A woman charged with leaving her two-day-old son outside to freeze before dumping him in the recycling was embarrassed that she didn't know who the father was, a court has heard. 

Angela Alexie, 24, gave birth to baby John Doe alone in a garage in Eastpointe, Michigan, on December 22, 2014, and cut the umbilical cord with her teeth.  

The mother-of-three, whose children are all in foster care, claims she didn't have the strength to take the baby to authorities as she was embarrassed and didn't know if her boyfriend was the father.

Angela Alexie, 24, (pictured on Friday) allegedly delivered the baby boy on her own in the unattached garage of a friend's house that she was residing in and then put the baby in a recycling bin after he had died

Steven Kaplan (left), Alexie's attorney said that she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' and that she did 'as well as she could' in caring for the child

Workers found the child naked and bundled in a black shirt as his body came down the conveyor at the Recommunity Recycling center in Roseville on January 14

Wrapping the child in a blanket, Alexie left the him on the floor of the open-windowed residential garage for two days as she slept inside, checking on him every two hours. 

She attempted to breastfeed him, she says, but he never latched on. She did not bring him formula.

On Christmas Eve, John died, and Alexie posted on Facebook 'RIP Baby', which she claims referred to somebody else's child. 

Alexie placed the body in a plastic bag and left him on the floor of the garage for another week before somebody placed the bag in a recycling dumpster, the court heard.

She is charged with felony murder and first-degree child abuse.  

The court also heard from Cyndee Johnson, a worker at ReCommunity Recycling who saw John's body come down the conveyor belt on January 14. 

He was blue, covered in snow, and curled up as if he were trying to stay warm, Johnson said. 

'When I first saw, it scared me,' Johnson said tearfully. 'I jumped back. I moved back. I realized this was an actual baby.'

'It just grabbed my heart. I knew something wasn't right.' 

'I said, 'That's a real baby. Stop the line! Stop the line!'' she testified. 

It is believed that the child was born on or around December 22 in the garage of a friend's house in Eastpointe (pictured) and died Christmas Eve night, but the Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office is still working to confirm the timeline

Police said Alexie went to and from the garage while living in the house to check on the baby and to feed him. They believe that the boy's body was put in a recycling bin that was picked up from the home on January 13

The boy, unofficially named Henry Alexander Macomb by morgue workers, 'must have suffered greatly' while left in the garage with low temperatures in the 30s, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said. It is believed that Alexie went to and from the garage while living in the house to check on the baby and to feed him

There is no official cause of death but authorities believe hypothermia played a major role. 

'She did nothing. She let that child freeze to death,' Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Bill Cataldo said on Friday, according to Detroit Free Press. 'He died when there were a number of ways to save him.'

Alexie said she concealed the pregnancy from her boyfriend and pretended to have miscarried.

Authorities released an appeal to find the mother, which prompted a response from Amy Lesniak, who is caring for two of Alexie's children.

She said she suspected Alexie was pregnant when she started missing visits, claiming to have the flu or stomach problems.

When she heard a baby was found in the dumpster, she called police saying she believed the child was Alexie's.  

Alexie, who has three other children in foster care, is charged with felony murder and child abuse in the death of her son

Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'. He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense

Steven Kaplan, Alexie's attorney, said she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' in court yesterday.

Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'.

He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense. 

Alexie has relinquished her rights to bury the baby.

The Macomb community has rallied together to provide a funeral and burial for the baby.

Eastpointe Judge Carl Gerds set bond at $1 million.
