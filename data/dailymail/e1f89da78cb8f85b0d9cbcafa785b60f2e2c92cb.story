A powerful Aston Martin with one previous owner would usually be expected to fetch a high price at auction.

But the successful bidder who drives away in this stylish sports car next month can expect to pay even more than normal - its previous owner was 007, James Bond.

The car, which appeared in the opening scenes of Quantum Of Solace starring Daniel Craig, will go on sale at an auction of Bond memorabilia, held to mark 50 years since the British secret service agent first appeared on the cinema screen.

The tarot cards used by Jane Seymour's character Solitaire in Live And Let Die will also go under the hammer.

And prospective buyers will have the chance to bid for dozens of other lots, including the belt with a golden bullet buckle worn by Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun.

The car, a 2008 Aston Martin 6 Litre V12 DBS 2-Door Coupe, is expected to be sold for between £100,000 and £150,000 at an auction at Christie's in South Kensington, London, on October 5.

Ten lots are to be sold at the invitation-only event, with a further 40 available for sale in an online-only auction from September 28 to October 8.

The catalogue for the '50 Years of James Bond' sale includes books, props, posters and costumes from all 23 Bond films.

Memorabilia

behind a franchise which began when Sean Connery played Bond in Dr No in
1962.

Global James Bond Day.
