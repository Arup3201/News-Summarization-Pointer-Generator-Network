Case: Rafal Nowak is accused of murdering 23-year-old business analyst Catherine Wells-Burr for her six-figure life insurance policy

A 'possessive' Polish factory worker accused of murdering his British girlfriend had tearfully begged her: 'Don't leave me' in the months before he allegedly killed the 23-year-old, her father told a court today.

Rafal Nowak, 31, was frightened that Catherine Wells-Burr would leave him before he smothered her at their home in Chard, Somerset, a jury heard.

It is alleged Nowak then left their home before his lover Anna Julia Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, removed her body and burned it in a nearby field.

The three Polish nationals deny murdering Bath Spa business graduate in September last year.

Bristol Crown Court today heard evidence from her father Philip Wells-Burr, who worked at the Numatic factory in Chard alongside his daughter and her partner.

He described Nowak, who has a wife and son in Poland, as 'possessive' and that the Pole would bombard business analyst Miss Wells-Burr with phone calls.

Catherine's parents said they treated Nowak 'like a son'  and allowed him to sleep 'at the end of their bed' and comforted him after their daughter's death, the court was told.

In a statement given to police, Mr Wells-Burr said: 'I felt he was quite possessive of her. She didn't get out with her old friends much.

'It was too much calling when she was supposed to be working.'

Mr Wells-Burr also recalled witnessing Nowak cry when he thought Miss Wells-Burr was going to leave him, months before her death.

The witness said Nowak had become upset when Miss Wells-Burr had a heated telephone conversation with her mother, something that prompted the Polish national to believe his partner was going to leave him.

Mr Wells-Burr said: 'I said to just leave them be (Miss Wells-Burr and her mother), let mother and daughter sort out their problems.'

He said he later saw Nowak crying about the situation and told him to 'grow up'.

'Catherine wasn't very happy,' Mr Wells-Burr said. 'That's when he came downstairs all sorry, begging and saying: "Don't leave me".'

The court heard how Nowak's former partner Anna 
Lagwinowicz (left) and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn (right) dumped Miss 
Well-Burr's body in a car which was then set on fire

The court heard a previous attempt to kill the 23-year-old Bath Spa University graduate on September 10 had to be cancelled at the last minute when Miss Wells-Burr's sleep was disturbed by a phone call from a wrong number.

The court heard concern was raised for Miss Wells-Burr (pictured) when she did not arrive at Numatic International, where her parents, sister Leanne and boyfriend Nowak also worked

Earlier that day, Nowak and Miss Wells-Burr had been for Sunday lunch around at her father's house.

He told the court the pair had acted differently that day, they weren't their usual 'lovey dovey' selves.

Prosecutors allege the trio created a fake trail of text messages with a 'mystery man', implying Miss Wells-Burr was having an affair with an unidentified man who was responsible for her death.

But police quickly identified clues allegedly pointing to Nowak, the 'bitter' and 'jealous' Lagwinowicz and her doting uncle.

The court was told Nowak was arrested soon after the investigation was launched, but went to stay with Mr Wells-Burr when he was released on bail.

Asked whether Nowak 'had ever mentioned Catherine' during the day he was with the grieving father,

Mr Wells-Burr replied: 'Not once.'

The court heard concern was raised 
for Miss Wells-Burr when she did not arrive at Numatic International, 
where her parents, sister Leanne and boyfriend Nowak also worked.

Richard
Smith QC, prosecuting, said Nowak initially told a colleague he had not
heard from Miss Wells-Burr and stated she had received a text saying 
'if I can't have you nobody can' from a mystery man.

He
later recounted the text to her parents, Phil and Jayne, at the factory
as they gathered to work out where Miss Wells-Burr was, while her 
sister Leanne went to their home in Chard to look for her.

Mr
Smith said: 'She wasn't answering her phone, she hadn't come in and her
car wasn't there. Nowak and Catherine's parents set off in a car to 
[their home] and met Leanne there.

Prosecutors allege Nowak smothered Miss Wells-Burr with a pillow as she lay sleeping in their new home in Chard, Somerset in September last year, Bristol Crown Court (pictured) has heard

'The police were contacted. She was nowhere to be found. As they waited the arrival of the police Nowak spoke to Jayne.

'He
said "I lost my world, I have lost my future". It struck Jayne as being
rather odd at the time because by that point Catherine was missing.'

Police
discovered Miss Wells-Burr's body in her red Ford Focus car a few hours
later and arrived to break the news to her parents.

Mr Smith added: 'Leanne and Nowak waited in the kitchen. Nowak remarked that he felt they were both suspects.'

Officers arrested Nowak later that day but released him due to his alibi and a lack of other evidence.

Mr Smith added: 'He was released to spend the night with the parents of the girl that he had murdered.

'They welcomed him back and let him sleep at the end of their bed, worried about him.'

But he was later re-arrested and charged with her murder after officers uncovered the 'evil' plan, Mr Smith said.

The three defendants did not confess to their part in the killings when interviewed by police.

Nowak, of Willow Way, Chard, Lagwinowicz, of South Street, Taunton, and Dmytryszyn, of Holway Avenue, Taunton, deny murder.

The trial continues.
