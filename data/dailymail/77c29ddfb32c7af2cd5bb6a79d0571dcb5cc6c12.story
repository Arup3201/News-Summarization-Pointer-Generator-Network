James Anderson faces the possibility of being banned from his home Test at Old Trafford after a date of August 1 was set for his ICC disciplinary hearing.

The England fast bowler ill be quizzed via Skype by ICC judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis the day after the third Test at the Ageas Bowl finishes after being charged with a Level 3 offence for allegedly 'abusing and pushing' India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja during the first Investec Test at Trent Bridge.

An initial hearing on Tuesday morning, also via teleconference and involving Anderson's legal representatives and others from the ECB and BCCI, 'addressed preliminary issues' and set the date for the next stage of the disciplinary process.

Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct

'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'.

Level 3 penalty

All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.

The date chosen for the full hearing is the day after the conclusion of the third Test against India at the Ageas Bowl, in a series England trail 1-0 following their 95-run defeat at Lord's.

It was also decided on Tuesday that following England's Level 2 counter-allegation against Jadeja over a reported spat between the two players in the Trent Bridge pavilion stairwell on day two of the match, the tourist's case will be heard by the ICC's match referee David Boon.

The punishments set out at Level 2, under the ICC's code of conduct, are less stringent and mean Jadeja is highly likely to escape a ban even if found guilty.

Anderson will discover his fate within 48 hours of the hearing at 9am on August 1 - the time frame in which the judicial commissioner is required to announce his decisions.

The fourth Test of five, at Old Trafford, is scheduled to start on August 7.

Lancastrian Anderson, even if found not guilty at Level 3, could - at Lewis' discretion - be penalised at a lower grade, such as the one Jadeja faces.

If banned, or even otherwise, Anderson will have a right of appeal - details of which will be confirmed if appropriate by Lewis, who will also set the date from which any suspension begins.

ROOT ROCKED (June 2013)

The angelic looking Joe Root winds up Australia opener David Warner so much in the VIP area of the Walkabout bar in Birmingham that the loudmouth Aussie punches the young Tyke.

BROAD WALK (July)

The mother of all rows erupts when Stuart Broad edges an Ashton Agar delivery to Aussie captain Michael Clarke at first slip. Incredibly, umpire Aleem Dar fails to spot the huge nick, Broad stands his ground... and there follows all manner of hypocritical spoutings from Aussies over not walking.

TROTT TORMENT (Nov)

Bully boy Warner is at it again, this time with the verbals, saying Jonathan Trott is ‘poor, weak and looked scared’ facing Mitchell Johnson. Trott was already on his way home, suffering from a ‘stress-related condition’.

MANKAD MESS (June 2014)

Controversy at Edgbaston as Sri Lanka spinner Sachithra Senanayake — who himself was later suspended over a suspect action — runs out England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for backing up too far, a dismissal known as a Mankad. The bad blood spills over into the Test series.
