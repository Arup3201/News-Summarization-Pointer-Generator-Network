Actress Denise Roberts, who plays the mother of Balinese prison inmate Schapelle Corby, has special insight into the jailed drug smuggler's family based on her own brother's 25 years in Sydney prisons

The actress who plays the mother of the notorious Australian drug trafficker about to be released from a Balinese prison has a special understanding of Schapelle Corby because her own brother has spent 25 years in jail.

Denise Roberts, whose brother Andrew is a convicted armed robber and one of Australia's most famous prison escapees, says she thinks Schapelle 'got the raw end of the stick'.

Roberts' brother, who goes by the criminal alias of Robert Cole, was once played by Australian film star Hugh Jackman in Corelli, which the actress wrote and produced.

Roberts based the story on the true prison romance her brother had with a jail psychologist while incarcerated, but the complete story of Cole - real name Andrew David Robertson - is a tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder.

Cast and crew of the TV movie Schapelle who have praised the 'incredible' transformation Roberts made to play Rosleigh Rose, were unaware of the actress's special insight into Corby's prison ordeal.

The movie screens next week, when the real Schapelle is due for release from the Balinese jail where she has been imprisoned since 2005 for smuggling marijuana.

Roberts told The Australian Women's Weekly the new film, which the Nine Network airs at 8.30pm on Sunday, 'gives a sympathetic and empathetic view of Schapelle'.

'Guilty or not guilty, I think she got the raw end of the stick,' Roberts said.

'Irrespective of what happened, I don't think anyone should be in a Bali prison that long.'

Roberts' brother has spent most of the last 25 years in New South Wales prisons and forensic hospitals serving time for robbery, kidnap, assault and drug and sex offences.

He was in Long Bay Prison Hospital in Sydney's south east when  Schapelle Corby was arrested at Bali airport with 4.1kg (9lb) of marijuana in her boogie board bag and locked up in Kerobokan jail.

Andrew Robertson, aka Robert Cole, (left) who has spent 20 years in prison, was played by movie star Hugh Jackman in a TV drama written by his actor/writer sister, Denise Roberts who plays Rosleigh Rose, the mother of Schapelle Corby (pictured, right, in a cell at Denpasar Court) in the new TV movie Schapelle

The 28-year-old beauty therapist from the Australian tourist resort strip, the Gold Coast, made international news.

Her life since in a crowded cell and the unsanitary confines of Kerobokan has become a national obsession in her home country, making next week's television movie about her a sure TV ratings hit for Channel 9.

Before Andrew Robertson's famous escape from an Australian prison, which he made less than a year after Corby's arrest in a foreign country, his eventful past was both a secret and, ironically, the plot of a hugely successful television series in Australia.

Unknown to his fellow inmates or few others than close family, Robertson was the basis of the main character of the 13-part Australian TV drama series Corelli, which first screened in 1995.

Roberton's sister created and co-wrote Corelli from what she knew of Robertson's forbidden relationship with Robyn Brentnall, a prison psychologist.

In Corelli, the prisoner played by Hugh Jackman, in one of his earliest career roles, falls in love with the psychologist of the title, played by Deborra-Lee Furness.

The infamous Kerobokan Prison in Bali, where Schapelle Corby has been incarcerated for nine years, a plight Schapelle TV movie actress Denise Roberts can empathise with because of her own armed robber brother's 25 years in jail

The real deal: this is Sydney's notorious Long Bay Jail, from which the brother of Schapelle actress Densie Roberts escaped in 2006, and where he fell for a real life prison psychologist and their romance formed the basis of the TV drama on which star Hugh Jackman met his future wife

The two actors fell in love on the set, married a year later and have adopted two children. Furness has taken a step back from her career while Jackman has gone on to become an international star.

Jackman has played Wolverine in the X-Men movie series, he won a Golden Globe for his role in Les Miserables and he is a Tony award-winning singer, dancer and stage performer.

The real life prison romance between Andrew Robertson and Robyn Brentnall is a complex tale which preceded Brentnall being struck off the practising roll of the NSW Psychologists Registration Board.

The relationship was forged when Robertson sought counselling while he was in a series of prisons, including Long Bay Hospital, where he was serving time for drug possession and breaching a parole order.

Robertson was released from prison in 1995, the year Corelli went to air.

He went to live with Brentnall, who was sharing a house in Sydney with her daughters and one of their boyfriends, Andrew Mazzitelli.

Mazzitelli and Robertson embarked on a crime spree together, committing a series of armed robberies across Sydney's north-west.

Brentnall became suspicious and contacted police, who arrested the pair. Both men were jailed.

Brentnall was, meanwhile, having problems with Denise Roberts over copyright of her story portrayed in Corelli.

In a further twist, another man who had fallen in love with Brentnall while she acted as his prison counsellor had been released from jail.

Guy Tiskins, who had served time for murdering his girlfriend, contacted Brentnall, who told him she was not interested in him romantically, but she nevertheless disclosed her copyright issues with Denise Roberts.

Tiskins allegedly later wrote letters to Roberts threatening to kill her, although he was never charged because of lack of evidence.

Robertson spent most of the next decade in prison, visited by his sister Denise, and transferred between different jails until he was legally declared a mentally ill prisoner, or forensic inmate, in 2003 and placed permanently in the maximum security hospital wing at Long Bay Jail.

Denise Roberts visited him while he was there, the brother and sister sometimes speaking in the pidgin language they had learned in Papua New Guinea, where they spent a happy childhood.

As a prison inquiry would find, late in 2005 Robertson began a drastic diet, which would result in him shedding 13 kg (more than two stone), a fifth of his body weight.

At the same time, he had begun to chip away at the bricks in his hospital jail cell with a butter knife, and in the early hours of January 18, 2006, he squeezed his 56kg (8.8 stone) frame through a gap between the brickwork and the steel bars.

Avoiding motion detectors and video cameras, he scaled a cyclone fence and climbed over razor wire to freedom.

The maximum security escape was an embarrassment for prison authorities and the subject of national derision.

Robertson was recaptured five days later in a Sydney shopping centre wearing a fake moustache and beard.

Playing Schapelle Corby's mother, Rosleigh Rose, pictured above with actor Colin Friels, who plays Corby's father, Mick,  Denise Roberts knew the trauma and heartbreak of having a family members in prison

Even thought he was subsequently released after serving time for his escape, Robertson reoffended and was again jailed, this time for aggravated sexual assault and detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage.

He remains in custody.

Denise Roberts told MailOnline she had drawn on two characteristics to play Schapelle Corby's mother, 'her fighting spirit and the fact she's a mother' and that she believed Rosleigh Rose had the 'stamina and endurance to see anything through'.

Roberts said she believed Corby had done enough jail time, particularly as one criminal linked with the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, had been released from prison years ago.

Roberts said she did not wish to comment about her brother and his imprisonment.

In 2006, following Robertson's escape, Denise Roberts told the Seven Network she feared for him if he was returned to prison.

'I think he's more dangerous to himself than he is to anyone else,' she said at the time.

'I dread to think what he'll do if he is taken back there.'

She later told his court hearing: 'It has been a revolving door system for [him].

'When he comes out of jail he goes onto drugs.'

Roberts, who along with her acting career runs the leading Australian film and television school, Screenwise, has helped launch the careers of some of the country's young talent, including Chris Hemsworth (The Avengers, Thor: the Dark World).
