Four students had to be rescued from the Dean of Durham's roof after a drunken prank went wrong.

Two fire crews and a police helicopter were called after the university students clambered on to the Dean’s roof last Friday night.

The Dean’s House is part of the 
cathedral - which dates back to the 11th century and has protected status
as a world heritage site.

It is thought the students were 
mimicking 'night climbers' from Oxford and Cambridge - who scale walls 
and buildings for a dare - but they got stuck and were unable to get 
down.

The rescue estimated to have cost several thousand pounds.

The helicopter was needed to locate the students on the cathedral buildings.

Today the Dean, the Very Rev Michael Sadgrove, criticised the students' 'reckless' behaviour.

He said: 'I cannot deny that I am deeply concerned that the cathedral has been treated with such disrespect, that Durham University has been brought into disrepute and that the taxpayer has had to bear the costs of a wholly unnecessary emergency call-out.

'But what most worries me is the reckless disregard the students had not only for their own lives but for others, in particular colleagues here at the cathedral and members of the emergency response team.

'Alcohol has obviously played a key part in this dangerous adventure and it is vital that this issue is addressed for the sake of good relations between Durham city and the university, and the welfare of the students themselves.

'Ironically it was other Durham University students who alerted cathedral security staff to the incident. Thank you to them, cathedral staff and the emergency services.'

Durham Police said the students have received a warning for their behaviour.

A force spokeswoman said: 'I can confirm that police and fire brigade were called to a group of students who were on the roof of the Dean’s House on Friday evening. These students were helped down by police and fire brigade.

'They attended Durham police station on November 6 to meet the neighbourhood police team and were given a warning regarding the consequences of their actions.'

The university is investigating the incident.

Professor Graham Towl, pro-vice-chancellor and deputy warden of Durham University, said: 'We are taking this incident very seriously and are currently investigating it in accordance with our internal procedures which includes liaison with the emergency services.'
