Hospital bosses have today blamed an Eastenders storyline for missing targets to see women they suspect have breast cancer.

The waiting time to see a specialist has doubled for some patients in the five months since January from the target of two weeks rising to four.

Watford General Hospital saw just 32 per cent of women with symptoms related to breast cancer within the two-week target in May.

The storyline featuring character Carol Jackson finding a lump and developing breast cancer as well as her children and brother being tested for the faulty BRCA gene began in December.

Bosses at Watford General Hospital have blamed the Eastenders storyline featuring character Carol Jackson's battle with breast cancer, for missing targets to see women they suspect have the disease

The storyline, featuring actress Lindsey Coulson, pictured in character, began in December and has caused a surge in the number of women seeking medical help over concerns they have the disease

The West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trustâ€™s chief executive, Samantha Jones, partly blamed its worsening performance on the soap's story line.

The department has a capacity of 70 new referrals a week but has seen that number rise by almost a third to 95 new cases a week.

NHS guidelines state that 93 per cent of patients with symptoms of the deadly disease must be seen within 14 days of being referred by their GP.

Figures showed from April to December last year the trust hit the target most months.

However since January it has not hit the target and by May the number being seen within two weeks had slumped to just 32 per cent.

The longest wait for a woman displaying potential signs of breast cancer was between three and four weeks.

Ms Jones, chief executive of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We would like to apologise to any patients who have had to wait longer to see a cancer specialist than they should have done.

'In common with many other trusts we have seen a growing demand for our cancer services over the past year, and a particularly significant increase in referrals for cancer over the last few months, which has been linked in part to a storyline in the TV soap EastEnders.

'To meet this extra demand we have put together a comprehensive cancer plan to ensure that, by October, we are meeting all the national cancer standards and providing a much improved experience for our patients and their families.

'As part of this work, we are increasing our capacity across the whole range of cancer services in order to be able to provide more outpatient clinics, and carry out more X-rays, blood tests and other diagnostic procedures.'

She said they were also talking to GPs about appropriate referrals.
