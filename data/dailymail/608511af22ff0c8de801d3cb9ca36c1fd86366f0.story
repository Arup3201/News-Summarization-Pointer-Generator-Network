The best suburbs to invest in each state have been revealed, and you will be surprised about where they are located.

In some cases, the percentage of rental return is up to 18 per cent.

According to real estate agents, the suburbs' popularity comes down to its close proximity to larger centres and its ties to the mining boom.

Venus Bay - just over two hours away from Melbourne - led the pack in Victoria with a 18.53 per cent return on housing, while Killcare was the best place to buy in New South Wales with a return of 16.33 per cent, according to Your Property Investment magazine.

Venus Bay on Victoria's south coast had the highest rental return with 18.53 per cent

Real estate agent Kerrie Ryan, from Ray White Killcare Peninsula, said the coastal town was a perfect place for families looking for a holiday home because it was a stone's throw away from Sydney. Killcare is just over an hour's drive away.

She said in the past 12 months were investing in the luxury of a holiday home close to Sydney.

'If husband needs to go back to work et cetera, he can duck off and mum and kids can stay, then he can come back,' Ms Ryan told Daily Mail Australia.

'Permanent rental properties don’t traditionally get a big yield in this area, but holiday prices do range considerably.

'Properties range from 800 a week to 6,000 a week.'

Ms Ryan said a lot of people were using their investment homes as a holiday rental property business.

One of the families who saw the value in a holiday home in Killcare were the Marcells from Sydney.

George Marcells' family have had their property on Hardys Bay in the town for more than 30 years.

'My parents bought it when we were little kids and we thought we’d keep it for our kids,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It’s close to work and close to Sydney, and you can always pop back up and down.

'It's just about two hours away and especially with kids you don’t have to sit in the car for hours and hours.

'It’s a beautiful area and unspoiled.'

Tasmania's Zeehan gave the highest return in the state for investors. Real estate agents say it's because of its proximity to mines

South Australia's Robe is also a good pick for investors, with a return of 14.02 per cent

Investors looking for a place in South Australia should look at Robe, which sees a 14.02 per cent return on houses, and in Northern Territory, Johnston investors get 13.09 per cent.

Meanwhile, those across Bass Strait in Tasmania's Zeehan are expected to see the highest return, 13 per cent, on units.

Jenayah Hampton, from Ray White Burnie that sells in the area, said these results seen in Zeehan did not surprise her as buying prices were low and rental prices were high.

She said the town's ties to the mining industry with the Avebury nickel mine and its proximity to other mines made it attractive to investors.

'Depending on what’s happening in the mines, it [affects] what the markets are doing,' Ms Hampton told Daily Mail Australia.

'With mines going ahead, prices are low and good rental return.

'But [there's] no crystal ball - you can’t predict what will happen next.'

Further north, Queenslanders in Smithfield can see a 10.99 per cent return on units and in Western Australia's Kambalda West, buyers can expect 10.19 per cent.

In the ACT, Scullin was the best place to invest with a 7.13% return on units.
