This creepy robot-spider dress has responds to strangers who stray to close by protectively drawing its legs up against the wearer's body

The garment is by Netherlands-based designer Anouk Wipprecht, a rising star in the field of wearable design, whose work explores the interaction between fashion and technology.

Like a real spider, the unsettling dress responds to external stimuli by coyly dancing around the wearer's body.

Unsettling: The dress has sensors which move its limbs in response to what is happening around it

Ms Wipprecht, whose techno-couture garments have been worn by Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas, told fashioningtech.com the dress deals with themes of 'personal space' and raises questions of control and privacy.

Created in collaboration with with Viennese software engineer and hacker Daniel Schatzmayr, the garment's robotic component uses sensors to move its limbs in response to what is happening around it.

The pair say the dress was created with the aim of giving more power and 'pyschological thrills' to the 'sugar-sweet character' of many fashion tech garments.

It was presented during VIVE LE ROBOTS / Cafe Neue Romance in Prague during the EU Robotics week last November and prototyped during TEDX Vienna in collaboration with the 'Metalab' - Vienna's famous hackerspace.

'Playful exploration': Ms Wipprecht's work studies the increasing interaction between humans and machines

In an interview with fashiontech.com, she said her work was a 'playful exploration' of the ever-more intimate relationship between humans and machines which is making electronics an extension of the self.

'Technology combined with fashion creates new ways of communication between people, a new relationship between interface and the body, and a new connection of the body with technology,' she said.

'For me it is a playful exploration, where the body is the platform of interaction and expression. The position that technology has in our society (i.e. to 'please' us) will get more and more intimate, and as technology crawls closer to the skin we will need to start to rethink and recreate the relation that we have towards technology.

Risque: Ms Wipprecht's Intimacy dress, which is made from materials which turn from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer's level of arousal, as measured by her heart rate

'In a way, communication-wise, techno enhanced fashion has the potential to mediate a human in more ways than a human can mediate itself. Therefore, amongst other reasons, I am interested in how emotional, social and psychological processes can be influenced using electronics as an extension of the self.'

Ms Wipprecht's previous works include a dress which emits a 'smoke screen' of dry ice to camouflage its wearer when someone approaches, and another which turns see through based on its wearer's 'personal interactions'.

That latter dress, dubbed Intimacy, is constructed from smart e-foils which change from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer's level of arousal, as measured by her heart rate.
