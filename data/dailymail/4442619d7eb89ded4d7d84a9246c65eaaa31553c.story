Sam Allardyce has revealed that Diafra Sakho had to be driven down in a limo to Bristol City for West Ham's FA Cup fourth round clash on Sunday.

The 25-year-old came off the bench to net the winner for the Hammers against the League One high-flyers to send them through to the next round.

However, Sakho's inclusion was a surprising one considering he withdrew from the Senegal squad to take part in this month's Africa Cup of Nations, after aggravating a back injury he picked up on international duty in November - which consequently ruled him out for three Premier League games.

That incensed Allardyce who then accused the Senegalese FA of ‘mistreating’ the Hammers hitman, with Sakho suffering with the problem ever since.

The 60-year-old has now been forced to defend the east London side's handling of the injury, insisting he done 'nothing wrong' by playing him in the cup tie against Steve Cotterill's men.

When questioned after the game Allardyce told Talksport: 'He's still unable to fly.

The 25-year-old has been in excellent form since joining the Hammers - scoring 10 goals in 16 appearances

Steve Cotterill's side gave a good account of themselves in the narrow defeat to the Premier League side

'We had to drive him (Sakho) down in a limo on Saturday afternoon, but other than that he said he can get out on the pitch and just see how he goes.

'Today (Sunday) was about putting him on the bench with the hope we didn't have to use him, but in the end bringing him on was the most important tactical decision for us.

'I spoke with the chairman and said he looks alright. We don't think we're doing anything wrong with what we've done and how we've approached it.'
