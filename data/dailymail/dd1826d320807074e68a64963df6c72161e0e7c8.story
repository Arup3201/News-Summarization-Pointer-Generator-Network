Led Zeppelin have unveiled two previously unheard recordings ahead of the reissue of the band’s first three albums in June.

The two tracks - blues classic Keys to the Highway, recorded in 1970, and an early version of the famous song Whole Lotta Love - are among dozens of tracks which the band will officially release alongside the reissues.

The companion discs will feature alternative versions of songs, works in progress and live performances, all recorded at the time of the original albums.

Special: The surviving band members (L-R) John Paul Jones, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page have selected the two tracks from their carefully catalogued archive of music recorded in the 1970s

The tracks, like hundreds of others, had been carefully catalogued but then locked away in the band’s archive for decades.

Guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, has spent two-and-a-half years combing through the vaults, listening to hundreds of quarter-inch tapes before choosing the best material.

'I don’t want to die and have somebody else do it,' he says. 'I’m authoritative about what was done in the first place.'

Page says the new material 'deserves to be heard' because 'it’s performance art'.

It will give fans the first chance to hear some of the band’s key recording sessions.

Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind, to appear on Led Zeppelin III, was recorded in 1970 at the Olympic Studios in Barnes in south-west London, about half an hour after Hats Off to (Roy) Harper. But it was never released.

Fans are clamouring to get hold of the subsequent reissues of three albums that will hit stores in June

'It was a particularly prolific time,' says singer Robert Plant, 'where we were learning about each other’s capabilities.

'Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated.'

The passing of time has also given Plant, who is now 65, a different perspective.

'My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn’t I shut up a bit?' he laughs. 'I kind of overcooked it.'

Page promises 'lots of surprises' on the three reissues, which are part of a plan to reissue all nine of the band’s studio albums in chronological order.

Despite intense support for the band decades after they broke up, they said the chance of a new gig is 'zero'

But he has dismissed rumours that there will be versions of songs featuring bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones on vocals.

For a band that broke up in 1980, following the death of the drummer John Bonham, interest in Led Zeppelin remains intense.

The surviving members reunited seven years ago for a concert at London’s O2. But fans will be disappointed if they are hoping there will be another one.

Page said: 'I’m sure people would love to hear it. I’m not the one to be asking, I don’t sing.'

Plant, however, is unequivocal. The chances of the band performing live again are, he said 'zero'.
