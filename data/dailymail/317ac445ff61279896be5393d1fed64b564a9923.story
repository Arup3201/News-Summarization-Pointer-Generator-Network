Argentine intimidation has led to the cancellation of two luxury cruise ship visits to the Falkland Islands.

The plush 700-capacity Seven Seas Mariner and Oceania Cruise flagship Regatta, owned by Prestige Cruise Holdings, axed an early February stopover to the British overseas territory.

John Pollard Managing Director of Port Stanley based Sulivan Shipping Services, agents for the Prestige Cruise group, confirmed the cancellations.

Mr Pollard said he believed the decision was taken in light of the increasingly aggressive tactics by Argentinean nationalists.

An FCO spokesperson said: ‘We are deeply concerned to learn that these cruise ships have cancelled their upcoming visits to the Falkland Islands following intimidation from factions in Argentina.’

The news follows militant action by Buenos Aires port workers on Wednesday which prevented the British-flagged Seabourn Sojourn cruise ship from setting sail for the Falklands.

Arriving in Hong Kong: The ship's 450 passengers paid between £4,200 and £9,300 each for the trip. It boasts 225 cabins spread over eight decks, a casino and two swimming pools

It was delayed for seven hours as United
 Maritime Workers Union leaders attempted, and failed, to wrestle a 
pledge from the captain not to land on the Falklands.

Mike Summers Chairman of the Falkland Islands Tourist Board said directors of the Miami-based Prestige group had showed ‘a disturbing lack of backbone’ and had ‘caved in to Argentine pressure’.

‘This type of bullying by a large aggressive neighbour against a small innocent community is despicable, and deserves to attract worldwide condemnation,’ Mr Summers said.

Cruise ship stops are estimated to be worth at least £10 million to the island’s economy. The announced cancellation will affect several small Falklands businesses. But there are fears that withdrawals by cruise companies could escalate.

Britain summoned Argentina’s ambassador Alicia Castro to London on Monday after masked leftists thrashed the offices of a shipping company in Buenos Aires, a move the Foreign Office alleged was aimed at deterring ships from visiting the disputed Falkland Islands.

Following the violent attack two cruise ships belonging to the Carnival Corporation, which carries 40 per cent of cruise passengers to the Falklands, pulled out of scheduled trips.

Posting on an online news board ‘Outlawcatcher’, a Falklands war veteran, voiced his support for the islanders: ‘As an ‘82 vet I can say that this behaviour by those contemptible people only reaffirms that our actions thirty years ago were utterly worth it. War didn’t work out for them and they now think that bullying will ... pathetic.’

The Foreign Office said yesterday: ‘We will take every necessary measure to support the Falkland Islanders.’
