Two garages have been put on the market for a combined £400,000 - more than twice the price of the average UK home.

The lock-ups, described as being 'very large', are located in London's upmarket Kensington, where houses change hands for seven-figure sums.

One of the garages has an asking price of £175,000 while the other, five units up, is available for £225,000.

The average price for a home sold in the UK, meanwhile, is £167,000.

And despite their eye-watering price-tags there has been serious interest with a number offers already turned down.

The garages can accommodate two cars with one of them currently being rented out for more than £6,000-a-year.

Both garages, located on Stanhope Mews East in SW7, are being sold by the estate agency Druce.

Just a mile away - in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge - a 6m long garage round the corner from Harrods 
went on the market for a stunning £525,000.

Sacha Moussaieff, who is managing the sales, said: 'They are very large garages and have space for two cars.

'Some people pay £400 a month for a single car parking space so it's actually good value.

'The location is key, parking is not easy in the area so it would perfectly suit someone who has bought a £4 - £5 million apartment and doesn't have private parking.

'It is ideal as a secure lockup for someone who may own an expensive car and spends six months out of the country. It gives them somewhere safe to leave it.

'The garage is also useful for improving your property value as it is an attractive asset to have.

'It is most likely to suit a rental investor or someone with a very expensive house looking for somewhere to park their valuable car.'

The two garages in Kensington are not the only London lock-ups with a hefty asking price.

Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential.

In October a double garage described as a 'postage stamp of land', situated on a leafy street in Highgate, north London, sold for £250,000 at auction.

In 2010 a dilapidated row of 
storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping 
£1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that 
they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss.

In 2012 a 6metre long garage 
went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey 
postcode in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge - near Harrods and some of the world's 
richest people.

And in August this year a 224sqft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat went on the market for £250,000.
