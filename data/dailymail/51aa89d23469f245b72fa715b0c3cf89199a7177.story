Waitrose is to open its first in-store restaurant following the success of smaller cafés placed within its larger supermarkets.

The upmarket grocer will launch its first waitress-serviced venue at the end of next year as retailers seek to find new ways to attract shoppers into their stores.

It already has 96 cafes in some of its 293 branches.

Tesco recently bought the Giraffe chain, and has bought stakes in branded bakeries and coffee shops which it is installing across its chain.

Waitrose Managing Director Mark Price said that the popularity of online shopping means retailers have to give shoppers new reasons to come to the High Street.

‘It is all about developing the role of branches in an era where online shopping is developing so strongly,’ he said. ‘We are coming up with new ideas to reinforce our commitment to offer the best possible service and give extra reasons to come into our shops.’

The Waitrose restaurant will be a relaxed family style venue offering pizza, beef-burgers and steaks using some of the products on sale in store.

While not fine dining Price believes customers would be willing to pay a little extra for a premium experience, and the venue would also showcase some of the food on sale in store.

A spokesman said: ‘It’s just trying something different so people can sit down and have a waiter service meal rather than self-service – it’s a different concept.’

The grocer, which is owned by its staff who are known as partners, already has a tapas bar at London’s Canary Wharf.

Waitrose is also testing a concierge service in 6 stores which takes in dry cleaning and shoe repairs.

In Horley in Surrey, Portishead in Somerset, Milton Keynes and Greenwich it will also wrap flowers bought as presents and offer iPads for customers to use to search for items.
