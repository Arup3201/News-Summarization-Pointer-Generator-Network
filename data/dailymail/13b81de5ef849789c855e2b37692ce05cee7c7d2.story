At least 18 spectators were trampled to death and 38 others were fighting for their lives after a riot broke out over a boxing match.

About 1,500 fans were crammed into a sports hall in the town of Nabire in Indonesia to watch an amateur fight.

But when visiting boxer Alvius Rumkorem was declared the winner over local favourite Yulius Pigome, fans erupted and chairs and bottles were thrown at the judges before supporters turned on one another.

In a stampede for the doors, scores were trampled.

Police said that they had recovered 18 bodies – 11 men and seven women – but – with around 40 injured on the critical list at a local hospital – the death toll is expected to rise.

Many of the most seriously injured were said to be women.

Youth and Sports Minister Roy Suryo said the stadium has a capacity of 500 to 600, he said. Police said it had only two working exits.

A total of 84 boxers participated in the Bupati (Regent) Cup Championships which started on July 9.

The riot happened after the final of the 128lb (58kg) division between Alvius Rumkorem and Yulianus Pigome, who Mr Suryo said are from different tribes.

Points awarded by a panel of judges to Rumkorem triggered protests by Pigome supporters.

Police and soldiers were deployed to stop the fighting, he said, adding that officers investigating the case have questioned 12 people - five organisers and seven witnesses.

Nabire, about 2,000 miles (3,200km) east of Jakarta, is on Cendrawasih Bay on the north coast of Papua.
