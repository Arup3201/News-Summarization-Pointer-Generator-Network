Author Wilbur Smith wooed wife Mokhiniso Rakhimova, pictured together in 2011, with an expensive lunch... but his plan almost backfired

As a best-selling author with millions in the bank, it is not hard to see why women might find Wilbur Smith attractive.

But his attempts to use his fame and estimated £100million fortune when trying to seduce the woman who is now his current wife almost backfired.

The 81-year-old met Tajikistan-born Mokhiniso Rakhimova, 42, in 1999 in a London bookshop while she was browsing Dan Brown novels. 

He quickly directed her attention to his own writings – before treating her to a £1,000 caviar lunch. 

Mr Smith’s efforts almost backfired when she assumed he must be penniless. 

In Russia, where she was educated, writers are often badly paid and caviar is treated as an everyday commodity. 

Mr Smith has sold more than 122million copies of his 36 books since 1964. But the South African writer said it took a while to persuade Russian-educated Miss Rakhimova he was successful. 

But he eventually persuaded her to overlook their 39-year age gap and made her his fourth wife months later.  

Recalling the moment they met in a London bookshop, Mr Smith told Reader’s Digest: ‘I lurked among the bookshelves and she was as exotic and lovely as I’d first thought. I sidled up to her and said, “Why are you looking at Dan Brown’s books?”

‘She told me she was studying English and her teacher had told her to read some colloquial writing. I said, “Let me suggest another writer,” and got down one of my own books.

‘When she realised I was the author she felt very sorry for me - in Russia, where she was from, writers are badly paid. And my clothes seemed horribly old to her.’

Mr Smith has sold more than 122million copies of his 36 books since 1964. He has a five-bedroom house in Cape Town, facing Table Mountain, and a three-bedroom town house in Knightsbridge in London.

But the South African writer said it took a while to persuade law student Miss Rakhimova – whose is nicknamed Niso – that he was successful.

He said: ‘She agreed to have lunch with me so, trying to impress, I took her to a caviar restaurant. Then she thought I must be really poor because in Russia, caviar is the cheapest thing on the menu.

‘Being a student and hungry, she ate four pots of the stuff, and when the bill came in at over £1,000, she couldn’t believe it.

‘Niso and I have been married 15 years. She’s made me a happy man and, except when I look in the mirror, I feel about 40 and know there are still many good memories to come.’

In the past, Mr Smith has admitted that his first two marriages – which gave him three sons – were ‘lust matches’.

Novelist Wilbur Smith, 81, married his current wife, pictured right in their London home, after he eventually persuaded her to overlook their 39-year age gap 

He was married to his third wife, Danielle, for 28 years and dedicated his books to her until she died from cancer in 1999, months before he met Miss Rakhimova.

Describing that marriage he said: ‘It was so good and then, at the end, so very sad. The cancer got into her brain and she was no longer the woman I’d loved all those years.

‘I sat beside her when she died and thought, “My darling, you’re at peace now”. She died in 1999, the same year as [his publisher] Charles Pick, and I felt so alone.’

Mr Smith is best known for his adventure novels, most of which are set in Africa.

The author also recalled one incident from his childhood that could have come straight from one of his own plots.

Aged just 14, he was left in charge of his parents’ 30,000 acre ranch while they were on holiday, when three lions attacked their cattle.

He said: ‘I grabbed my father’s rifle. When we got to the pasture, I could see three dead cows – and the distinctive ears of a lioness.

‘She charged at me, so I shot her. Then another lioness came out and I shot her as well. Then a big male who’d been lurking nearby ran at me so I shot him.’

He added: ‘When my father came back he was amazed. He gave me a hiding for being so stupid as to go after lions, then gave me the rifle as a reward for being so brave.’
