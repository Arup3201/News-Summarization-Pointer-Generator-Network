Would you swap your mascara for shoe polish? Late novellist Dame Barbara Cartland did - and even passed on the tip to fans, as newly discovered letters have revealed.

'I use Meltonian black shoe cream for my eyelashes,' wrote the author in a message to fan Sue Barker in 1959.

The newly discovered beauty tips were part of a cache of letters collected from Barker's Cheshire home by her second cousin, Nada McArdle.

Dame Barbara's famous jet black lashes came courtesy of 'shoe cream' according to her letters

Barker, who died 15 years ago, appeared to have been a big fan of Cartland's work and maintained a correspondence with the author until her death.

Along with shoe polish as an alternative to mascara, Cartland also talked of her love of vitamins and health supplements including some that were 'not on the market yet.'

Advising Barker on health supplements, Cartland wrote: 'The Natrovites should be sufficient to combat colds but you could also take Vitavel A capsules as well as the Redoxon Vitamin C, for your skin, and also Wheat Germ Oil, which you can obtain from the Organic Vitamin Company.'

She added: 'I have not recommended anything that I have not tried personally and found to be good.'

Dame Barbara also gave fans advice on what supplements to use - including some not on the market

Cartland was famous for her heavily made-up look and all-pink ensembles, and wrote 728 books - selling an estimated one billion copies in the process - prior to her death at the age of 97 in 2000.

Although the majority of the works were romantic fiction, Cartland also penned a tome entitled Barbara Cartland's Book Of Beauty And Health, which contains such gems as 'you look as you think and feel, especially after 20'.

So popular have Dame Barbara's tips proved, they've even inspired a blog - Leopards and Lillies - dedicated to sharing them.

Her son, Ian McCorquodale, told the Times that his mother received up to 10,000 letters a year and replied to each one with the help of a secretary.

'She liked to use black shoe cream for her eyelashes,' he added. 'It gave a better black and lasted a lot longer.'

On beauty:

'If you give the other person your 
complete attention when they are speaking to you, they will invariably 
remember you as beautiful.'

'Keep your face above all, even before your body.'

On skincare:

'Citrus fruit juices and coffee are death to the complexion.''Put honey on your spots and by morning you will find that they have disappeared.'

Use the yoke of an egg mixed with almond oil as a facemask. Allow to dry and wash off with rose water.

Wash your face with cold water first thing in the morning.On keeping trim:

'The two best exercises in the world are 
making love and dancing. If find yourself unable to practice these two 
options, try walking on tip toes around the house and kicking your legs 
like a can-can girl.'

'Do all you can to keep a waist. It is 
natural for many women to put on weight as they age, but if you can keep
a small waist it gives one an appearance of being slim and elegant.'

'Keep your feet in good order; this makes all the difference to the way you walk – your walk can often give away your age.'

On alcohol:

'If you drink at a party, take four Brewers Yeast tablets before going to bed as alcohol destroys Vitamin B in the body.'

'The safest alcohol choices are good brandy and white wine.'
