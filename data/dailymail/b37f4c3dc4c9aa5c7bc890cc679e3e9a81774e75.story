Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Simon Mignolet are seen on a mad dash to make it to the red carpet in time in an amusing new advert featuring the Liverpool trio.

The players are seen in the changing room getting dressed after a game when Henderson receives a text telling him they are running late.

They run into a car park where a Liverpool supporter is peacefully reading his newspaper in a Reliant Robin, only for the club's vice-captain Henderson to disturb him by knocking on the window to ask for a lift.

Henderson, Sterling and Mignolet ask a Liverpool fan in a car park to give them a lift to where they need to go

The Liverpool fan agrees to give them a lift but the car does not start with them inside

But the car does not start when the three join the driver inside, resulting in the players pushing it down the ramps and around the turns of a multi-story car park, before the driver eventually gets them to the red carpet on time.

Henderson, Sterling and Mignolet will hope that   their visit to Crystal Palace in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday will be less stressful.

But Selhurst Park has not been a happy stomping ground for Brendan Rodgers' side.

Liverpool have announced a partnership with Nivea which the advert is in relation to

They infamously surrendered a three goal advantage by conceding three times in nine minutes to all but end their title hopes last season.

And when they faced Palace in November this season, they took the lead in the second minute through Rickie Lambert before the London side went on the rampage at ended up winning the match 3-1.

The advert, released as part of Liverpool's Nivea Men partnership announced on Thursday, will be broadcast from Friday onwards.
