But Queensland did not feature, with the one suburb to be included in last quarter's list - Holland Park in south-east Brisbane – dropping out of the top 10.

'Buyers are realising the value South Australian properties offer which may explain why buyers are moving away from Queensland areas,' realestate.com.au's head of sales Steve Carroll said.

Harris Real Estate managing director Phil Harris said South Australian properties were becoming more attractive to homebuyers, due to the state's affordable entry points. 

This house in Gymea, in the southern suburb of Sydney, sold for $1.22 million last month. Gymea was number five on the list

At number six on the list was the Victorian suburb of Ringwood North. This house is for sale in Ringwood, in Melbourne’s north-east

The modern, spacious, four-bedroom property at 98 Old Warrandyte Road is expected to sell for more than $900,000

This house is for sale in Semaphore Park, in Adelaide’s north-east. The beachside suburb came in at number seven on the list

The three-bedroom house has two bathrooms, a swimming pool, two parking spaces and is only a few minutes’ walk from the beach

'All sections of the market are looking at property here. $250,000 can get you a beautiful home in a fantastic inner city location while this price may not get you much value in other states,' Mr Harris said.

South Australia's Parkside and Unley also topped the previous quarter's list.

In the same quarter last year, the top four suburbs were Balgowlah in NSW, Albert Park in Victoria, Norwood in SA and Frenchs Forest in NSW. None of them were featured in this quarter's top 10. 

At number eight on the list was the Victorian suburb of Vermont. This house in Vermont, in Melbourne’s east, sold for $955,000

The four-bedroom house has two bathrooms, two parking spaces, sleek wooden floorboards and spacious living zones

'There was a lot more interest towards Sydney’s northern suburbs including Balgowlah and Frenchs Forest last year which has shifted to areas in the west with suburbs St Clair and Drummoyne attracting a high number of buyers,' Mr Carroll said,

'It highlights that these western areas are offering similar lifestyles at a more affordable price.'

To compile the list, realestate.com.au collects the number of clicks per suburb (only including suburbs with more than 20 property listings) over three months.

The number of clicks is then compared with the number of properties listed in the area, and suburbs are ranked to show the areas where demand outstrips supply.

At number nine on the list was the Victorian suburb of Montrose. This Montrose house is expected to sell for more than $850,000

At number four on the list was the New South Wales suburb of Drummoyne. This Drummoyne house sold for $2.6 million

The five-bedroom property has four bathrooms, two parking spaces and boasts panoramic views over Five Dock Bay
