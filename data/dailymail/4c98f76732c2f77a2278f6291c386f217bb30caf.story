Police seized thousands of nickel and copper-alloy pieces used to make the coins and machinery that embeds them with the Greek national design.

The arrests were made in the village of Epanomi, 12.5 miles outside Thessaloniki, after receiving a tip from authorities in neighboring Bulgaria and working with the European Union's crime-fighting agency Europol.

According to Athens News police are said to have been surprised by the near perfection of the counterfeit coins produced by the gang in their high-tech laboratory, which was located in a farming region.

Counterfeit: As many as 4,200 two euro coin cores, 63,000 bronze internal cores and nickel external rings were discovered by officers

Police found and confiscated a hydraulic coin press and other state-of-the-art coin minting equipment, a precision scale, various types of ammunition and 4,200 two-euro coin cores.

A search of the car of the 59-year-old, believed to be the 'mastermind' of the counterfeiting gang, turned up 63,000 bronze internal cores and nickel external rings for two-euro coins, several counterfeiting tools and hand-written notes.

A large number of coins from various eurozone countries were also found and are being examined in order to assess whether they are genuine.

The police confiscated 2,000 legitimate euros in cash and six cell phones that were found in the possession of the 41-year-old.

A less well-organised prankster, meanwhile, was kicked out of school for similar counterfeiting in Austria yesterday after printing off thousands of euros worth of fake bank notes on his parents' photocopier.

The 15-year-old handed out 3,000 euros worth of notes to pals at a school in Linz, after watching a TV programme about counterfeiting.and tried to use them in the tuck shop.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he wanted to win friends at the school as he felt like an outsider.

The two pieces are displayed together to show, how when embossed, can look very similar to the two euro coin
