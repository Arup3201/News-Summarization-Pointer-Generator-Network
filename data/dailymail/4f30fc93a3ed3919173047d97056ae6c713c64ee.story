The gallows used to hang an infamous prohibition-era gangster in one of America's last public executions have been discovered in a dusty old barn.

Bootlegger Charlie Birger was hanged in the town of Benton on April 19, 1928. He famously went to his death with a grin telling the crowd who had gathered to watch: 'It's a beautiful world.'

He had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of an Illinois town's mayor and was one of the last people to be publicly hanged in the state of Illinois.

Now, some 85 years after his death, a family has discovered the gallows used in his execution have been uncovered in aÂ  barn near the city of Grand Tower, about 50 miles from Benton.

They contacted administrators of the Franklin County Jail Museum in Benton, which has many items related to Birger, including his machine guns and bullet proof vest.

The location of the gallows was last 
known in 1973, when they were housed in the Jackson County courthouse 
basement.

They were pulled out for a Fourth of July event that year but then 
the courthouse lost track of their whereabouts, according to WSIL-TV.

Preservationists had been trying to find them for decades, but had no luck until now.

The
 museum will now house the real gallows inside, while a replica of them,
 which were built in 1995, will remain outside the building.

Charlie Birger, a Russian immigrant whose real name was Shachna Itzik Birger, was executed on April 19, 1928 after spending a year in jail.

According to the jail museum, he was a 
well-liked 'protector,' known for tossing coins to kids and even sharing
 his wealth among a few neighbors in the southern Illinois community of 
Harrisburg.

In the mid 1920s he famously went to 
war with the Ku Klux Klan who supported supported prohibition viewing 
alcohol as 'un-American'.

To law enforcement, he was known for for his bootlegging business, which he ran out of a speakeasy called the Shady Rest.

The business is what led him to be convicted in plotting the murder of Joseph Adams, who was the mayor of West City, Illinois.

Adams
 got into the middle of a turf war between Birger's gang and another group
 of bootleggers and as violence escalated, Adams wound up dead.

He was 
allegedly shot to death at the front door of his home by two of Birgers' men.

Birger was later 
arrested for plotting Adams' murder.

Some
 say Birger's smile on the day of his hanging could have been a result of the
 dosage of morphine he was provided just before he walked to the 
gallows.

Others claim, however, that Birger had actually declined the drugs.

The last person to be publicly executed in the United States was Rainey Bethea, a young black man who had confessed to the rape and murder of a 70-year-old white woman named Lischia Edwards.

An estimated 20,000 people turned out to watch as he was put to death in Owensboro, Kentucky.

The two men chosen to perform the hanging were Arthur Hash, a former Louisville police officer, who offered his services for free and a farmer from Epworth, Illinois, named G. Phil Hanna.

Bethea's execution, which took place on August 14, 1936 was an unmitigated disaster. It had widely been expected that the hanging would be carried out by the sheriff of Daviess County - a Mrs Florence Shoemaker Thompson.

Newspapers from around the country had sent reporters expecting to cover the first ever execution of a man by a woman.

Instead Hash arrived drunk, wearing a white suit and a white Panama hat.

When the moment came and Hanna ordered him to pull the trigger which operated the trap door sending the convicted man to his death, the drunken Hash did not respond and a deputy was forced to do the job instead.

Hanna said it was the worst display he had witnessed in 70 hangings and the ensuing media circus led to authorities stopping public hangings.

The last person to be executed by 
hanging in the U.S. was convicted murderer Ben Bailey who was put to 
death in Delaware in 1996.

Bailey was found guilty of the murders
 of 80-year-old Gilbert Lambertson and his 73-year-old wife Clara 
Lambertson, after sneaking into their farmhouse in 1979.

Although originally sentenced to hang,
 Bailey was given the option of lethal injection because the state of 
Delaware had changed its method.

But he refused saying: 'I'm not going to let them put me to sleep.'

Because Delaware had not carried out a
 hanging in 50 years, it had to ask advice from the state of Washington 
where hangings had recently been performed.

Bailey was one of only three people 
to be hanged in the U.S. since 1965 - the other two were Charles Rodman 
Campbell and Westley Allan Dodd.

The gallows used for the execution 
were dismantled in 2003, when death row inmates were no longer given the
 option of choosing hanging over lethal injection.

Today hanging is only permitted as a method of execution in Washington and New Hampshire.
