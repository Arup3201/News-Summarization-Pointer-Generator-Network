Getting children into the bath is an age old hurdle for parents around the world.

But a bizarre new video depicting a woman escorting her pet crocodile into a steamy bath suggests the challenge is faced by reptile owners, too.

The vision, uploaded to YouTube this week, shows proud crocodile owner Vicki Lowing lifting her freshwater croc Johnie into the bath as he angrily thrashes around.

‘C’mon buddy. There’s a girl, let’s have a bath,’ Lowing says.

A previous Daily Mail report suggested 18-year-old Johnie was 1.5 metres long and weighed 12kg.

 Nicknamed Croc Lady in Melbourne, Lowing, 57, has owned crocodiles for nearly 40 years, and she claims she can even communicate with them telepathically.

Lowing said she first became fascinated with the animals after watching a film in the 1960s, and she has never looked back.  

Surprisingly, the Melbourne mother has yet to suffer any injuries from all her years handling the notorious predators.
