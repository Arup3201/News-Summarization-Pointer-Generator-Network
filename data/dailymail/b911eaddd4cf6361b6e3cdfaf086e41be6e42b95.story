A historic chalet has been saved from destruction  after decades of erosion to the Quinault River's banks left the building teetering on the edge of collapse.

The Enchanted Valley chalet was built in the 1930s  in the Olympic National Park, Washington, a safe distance from the water. But over time, as the harsh weather took its toll, it became obvious the chalet had to be relocated.

Plans for a move were ramped up when last winter's dramatic storms wore away the banks to such an extent that it pushed them  under part of the chalet, leaving it dangling over the water below.

Rescue: Workers were able to drag the 1930s building back from the brink after flying in gear

It had today been dragged 68ft from the river bank, buying it years of extra time.

The remote location, 13 miles from the nearest road, could only be reached with a combination of mules, who carried tools to the site, and helicopters for bigger items.

Contractors were expected to complete the relocation of the Enchanted Valley chalet over the next few days, and the lodge will be moved a total of 90ft from the Quinault River. 

The 42-by-28-foot structure was built as a wilderness lodge in the 1930s. It has been used as a ranger station and emergency shelter.

Park officials said storms last winter and high flows led to the river's main channel shifting by at least 15 feet, and recent photographs showed that the chalet was undercut by the river by around 8 feet. 

Building contractors moved the chalet by lifting it from its foundations and slid it along steel beams to its current location.

The building will be lowered onto cribbing towers at its final home.
