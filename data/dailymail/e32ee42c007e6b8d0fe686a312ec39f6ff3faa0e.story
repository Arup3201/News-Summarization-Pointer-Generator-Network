A former North Sea oil worker told who went from drilling wells to snapping some of music's biggest stars including Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne, Kanye West and Lily Allen, is now auctioning off his photographs to raise money for charity. 

Mick Hutson, 48, has gone from slaving away offshore to photographing musical idols from every corner of the globe including the likes of Michael Jackson, Sir Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones.

Newcastle-born Hutson, moved to Aberdeen when his father got a job in the oil and gas industry. Hutson followed his father's footsteps but his love of live music was always in the background and he routinely went to rock venues for a brisk 8am pint after coming onshore.

Mick said: 'I'd always been one of the boys who drank in the rock bars around Aberdeen half the year, and spent the other half toiling my life away offshore. 

'I loved going to all the local rock gigs, took some photos for a few bands here and there, and decided that I wanted to get into photography as a full-time gig.'

He studied for a Masters degree in photography, taking photos of his friends' bands as a hobby whenever he could.

Mick said: 'It was that little side project that led me to meeting and basically becoming the apprentice of David Redfern, who was one of the greatest jazz photographers of all time.'

Hutson also snapped Michael Jackson. The photographer is now auctioning off his pictures for charity

Marilyn Manson shot by  Hutson. The snapper moved to Aberdeen when his father got a job in the oil and gas industry but after working on the wells, he followed his dream of becoming a music photographer

He had worked with and was good friends with all the greats like Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald and even the Beatles.

'After about two or three years with him I found myself touring around Arizona with U2 and the rest is history. I've not stopped working since.'

Mick has photographed Aerosmith, Metallica, Alice Cooper, and even rappers such as Kanye West and 50 Cent, but one of his favourite subjects was Marilyn Manson.

He said: 'He's such a quiet, interesting and well-spoken guy with a lot of good points to make about the world.'

The Rolling Stones photographed in Miami by Hutson. Years of photography have amounted to a huge collection of pictures, which the photographer is now auctioning to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust

Hutson's years of photography have amounted to a huge collection of pictures and recently he has been selling some off at auctions to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Now he is hoping to put on a display and auction them off in the place where it all began.

He said: 'I've just finished a show for my 25th year as a photographer in Newcastle, and there's one coming up in London, but I would love to do one in Aberdeen.'

I don't profit from any of my shows, and they usually raise between £5,000 and £6,000.

'Music is so important for the development of a teenager, especially one whose life is interrupted by something awful like cancer.

'Teenage Cancer Trust have always given huge support to music and musicians for their work with kids with cancer, so I'm happy to be giving something back.'

Teenage Cancer Trust patron, Roger Daltrey, said: 'Teenagers shouldn't have to stop being teenagers just because they have cancer.

'They are young people first, cancer patients second. With their incredible vigour and positivity as inspiration, we aim to keep Teenage Cancer Trust leading the world in cancer care for this age group.'
