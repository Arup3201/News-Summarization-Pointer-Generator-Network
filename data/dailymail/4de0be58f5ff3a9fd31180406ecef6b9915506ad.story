An American company has invented cups, straws and drink stirrers which can detect the date rape drug.

DrinkSavvy, Inc is developing the technology - which changes colour if it comes into contact with the 'predator drugs' - ready for the items to be trialled at a bar this Autumn.

Inventor Michael Abramson decided to create Drink Savvy after he was 'spiked' and left unconscious until the following morning.

An American company has invented cups, straws and drink stirrers which can detect the date rape drug

The technology is designed to indicate when a liquid has been contaminated with GHB, rohypnol or ketamine - known as roofies

The items he has created included sensor strips, which change colour to alert  the drinker that something is wrong with their drink.

Mr Abramson developed the items in collaboration with scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and said it is relatively inexpensive.

He told CBS Boston com: 'The costs will be very competitive with normal drink ware that the clubs and bars are already using so there shouldn’t be any financial disincentive not to really swap out their entire plastic cups straws and glasses for DrinkSavvy straws and glasses.'

A Boston bar will trial the glasses in Autumn and Mr Abramson hopes the technology will hit the market next year.

In a statement on his website, Mr Abramson said: 'Each year it is estimated that millions of men and women will be victimised by drug-facilitated sexual assault or date rape.

'Our number one mission is to eliminate this crime from ever being possible.'

The technology is designed to indicate when a liquid has been contaminated with GHB, rohypnol or ketamine - known as roofies.

The tasteless, colorless, and odorless nature of date rape drugs make them otherwise nearly impossible to detect.
