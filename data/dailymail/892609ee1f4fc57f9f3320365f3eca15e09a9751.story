‘There’s a famous seaside place called Blackpool, that’s noted for fresh air and fun.’

The lines are more than 80 years old, yet still they fix the image of Blackpool in the public mind. No matter that the town has fallen on desperately hard times, Blackpool is fresh air and fun, candyfloss and Kiss Me Quick. And football.

A fine club, albeit sadly reduced, like the town whose name it bears, yet still the club of Matthews, Mortensen, gentle Jimmy Armfield. And now, Karl Oyston.

Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after abusive text messages to fans

Oyston has issued an apology for 'any offence or distress caused by my text responses'

Oyston is the chairman of Blackpool, and among certain affluent circles up there on the Fylde Coast, he cuts a mighty figure. He has money, a robust sense of his own importance, and trenchant opinions, the most recent of which have been directed at a Blackpool supporter named Steve Smith.

Now I suspect that Mr Smith is not an especially engaging individual, and the text messages he sent to the chairman may well have been provocative. But consider Oyston’s responses.

‘Are you sure we’ve met?’ asks Oyston. ‘I would have remembered such a massive retard.’ He calls him ‘an intellectual cripple’ and tells him to ‘enjoy the rest of your special needs day out’.

He adds: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn’t have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium.’

There is more in similar vein, but you get the drift.

Oyston's insults revealed a lot about his character

Now we need not speculate about the kind of mind which could conjure up phrases like ‘retard’ and ‘cripple’, or use ‘special needs’ as a spiteful slur. Such are Oyston’s poisonous views, and he is welcome to them.

But those opinions carry a much wider significance than the trumpeting of a minor clown. For in his own town, he is seen as the face of his club. Far more disturbingly, he is a member of the board of the Football League, a body with considerable power and influence.

In other words, at a time when football at large is making commendable efforts to improve its image and enhance its credibility, a man like Karl Oyston retains a voice in the governance of the national game.

Oyston’s reaction to the publication of the texts was entirely predictable. He made a self-serving apology — ‘I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family’ — and he announced he would be making a donation to Blackpool’s Community Trust, which works with organisations supporting disabled people. Money solves everything, you see; fill a few pockets and people forget.

The calculation is as obvious as it is abhorrent.

In fact, the Oyston family have a great deal of money, much of it deriving from their association with Blackpool FC.

The most outrageous example was revealed in these pages by my colleague Nick Harris. Following the club’s sole season in the Premier League in 2010-11, Owen Oyston, the chairman’s father and Blackpool’s majority shareholder, was paid £11million.

As Harris pointed out, this was considerably more than the wage bill for the first-team squad and manager combined. Such grotesque largesse would have been unacceptable had Blackpool enjoyed some success. In fact, they were relegated. The club emerged with some £40m from that season, but miserably little was spent on improving the team.

Instead, players were allowed to leave in droves, while replacements were sought in the bargain basement. A week before the start of the current season, the club employed just eight fully-fledged professional footballers.

In that same week, I attended a friendly with Burnley.

The pre-match announcer declared: ‘The Seasiders team will be: Number One, Trialist … Number Three, Trialist …’ And so on.

Later, when the substitutes started to arrive, they were identified as, respectively: ‘Number 15, Number 14, Numbers 13 and 16, and finally, Number 17.’

It was like some dark pantomime, an extended practical joke. Before a ball was kicked, the bookmakers declared them odds-on favourites to be relegated.

Blackpool, under Oyston's guidance, are seven points adrift at the bottom of the Championship

The current Championship table tells its own story.

And all this has happened under the regime of the Oystons; the convicted rapist of a father and his odiously offensive son. Yet I fancy they know that the game is up, that they have known it since Tuesday evening, when their shirt sponsors Wonga said of Karl’s texts: ‘The comments were unacceptable, something we’ll be making clear to the club.’

A lecture on morality from a legalised loan shark, there can be no more humiliating chastisement.

The next moves are already taking shape.

As custodian of the game’s values, the Football Association are investigating with a view to taking the strongest measures available to them.

Given the nature of the offence, the Football League will come under pressure to remove Oyston Junior from their board at the earliest opportunity. And after such shows of disapproval, the hope must be that a decent football club finds a way of ridding itself of its current owners.

Their departure will come not a moment too soon. For that seaside place of fresh air and fun deserves very much better than its obnoxious Oystons.

PS

Christmas brings out the eloquence in football managers, and 2014 proved a vintage year. 

Thus the perceptive Alan Pardew reflected on Newcastle conceding three goals at Old Trafford: ‘We need to defend better than we did today.’ 

And the equally astute Mark Warburton, after Brentford were battered by Ipswich: ‘You can’t go three down to teams of that quality.’

But the public speaking prize goes to our old favourite Stuart Pearce, following Forest’s beating at Middlesbrough. Effortlessly combining two evergreen clichés, he mused: ‘At this moment in time as a club, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.’ Happy New Year.
