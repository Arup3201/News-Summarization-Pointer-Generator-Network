Group Captain Wendy Williams has been awarded £560,000 in compensation after suing the Ministry of Defence for sexual discrimination

An RAF nurse who helped wounded soldiers has been awarded £560,000 compensation after suing the Ministry of Defence for sexual discrimination.

Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, took the MoD to an employment tribunal after accusing the air force of favouring men instead of women for promotion.

The nurse, who treated injured personnel flown into Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital from Afghanistan, brought the case in July 2011 
after being passed over for the position as RAF candidate for the 
tri-service role of commodore of the Defence Medical Group.

She told the hearing a male doctor who had three-and-a-half years' fewer service than her was given the promotion.

The tribunal judge had previously 
been told that only six of 470 top positions among the Armed Forces 
medical staff had been held by women between 2011 and 2012.

In its ruling, the tribunal panel, 
led by Ms Dean, criticised the RAF for this 
practice and also the low number of women in top ranks overall - 
amounting to between 1% and 1.3% of the total.

Ms Williams, the highest-ranking RAF nurse, told a previous Birmingham Employment Tribunal  hearing: 'It was apparent the promotion process was stacked against me as a nurse and midwife.'

As
 a registered nurse and midwife who had served in the RAF since 1984, 
and who had been a group captain since 2003, Group Capt Williams 
expected to win the role.

But
 despite her experience, and her being recommended for promotion to a 
senior non-nursing role based on her experience, the post went to Group 
Capt John Gaffney.

The 1* level role went to Group Capt Gaffney despite him having three-and-a-half years fewer service as a Group Captain.

Group
 Captain Williams claimed the MoD had breached the 2010 Equalities Act 
by discriminating against her because of her gender when recruiting for a
 role for which she recommended and well-qualified.

The tribunal was told that it was the
 RAF’s procedure to fill medical 1* roles that were theoretically open 
to doctors and nurses only with doctors.

She
 sought compensation after complaining she had been humiliated, 
demoralised and 'totally let down' by the RAF’s attitude towards 
promoting women - and claimed a male group captain got the top medical 
job instead of her.

Tribunal
 judge Miss Victoria Dean announced at a previous hearing that Ms 
Williams was  discriminated against because of her sex.

Now the tribunal has ruled the Ministry of Defence should award her a total of £557,038.

The total includes £204,079 for loss of earnings, £105,585 pension loss and £22,000 for injury to feelings, plus more than £500 interest.

Ms Dean made several recommendations to the MoD in announcing her compensation, including that those involved in promotion of recruitment should receive more training in equality and diversity.

Until recently Ms Williams was responsible for the command and control of treating the severely wounded servicemen and women from Afghanistan at the hospital, where the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine is based.

The Royal Air Force only had six women in its 470 top jobs last year, the tribunal heard

She had been praised by Brigadier John Parker at the previous tribunal hearing.

He said: 'Her performance, during a very demanding period, revealed an officer of great skill, energy, drive and potential as well as having an excellent understanding of the operational environment of an NHS Trust.

'She demonstrated an ability to lead the military part of the joint and combined operation in  Birmingham.'

Ms Williams, who showed Prince Charles around the hospital during her career, has now retired and moved to Cambridgeshire. The Ministry of Defence had denied the sex discrimination allegation.

Group
 Capt Williams said  at the time of the ruling last summer that she was pleased with the decision, saying: 
'Following this decision, I hope that nurses in the Royal Air Force and 
the wider Armed Forces will have the opportunity to aspire to, and 
attain, more senior posts.

'I hope that nurses will also gain due recognition for their leadership, commitment and professionalism.

'This
 judgment represents an opportunity for the Armed Forces to scrutinise 
internal processes and practices and shatter glass ceilings.

'It should be used as a platform to 
ensure that appointments are made with regard to merit and competencies,
 and not with regard to a person’s gender or their membership of a 
professional body.'

The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, formerly Selly Oak Hospital, is where opeartional casualties are treated after being flown back from war zones. MoD hospital staff are fully integrated with civilian staff and are not limited to treating military patients alone.

Staff are drawn from all three services and are liable to be deployed to war zones when needed.
