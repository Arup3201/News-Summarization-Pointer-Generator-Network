Fourteen months have passed since Aleksandr Tonev first had the chance to join Celtic. It is a period that has provided precious little joy for the winger.

Opting instead to move to Aston Villa in a £2.2million deal from Lech Poznan, he struggled to make any impact on Paul Lambert’s side amid the rarefied atmosphere of the Barclays Premier League. Tonev made a mere six top-flight starts before finding himself surplus to requirements this summer.

Stiliyan Petrov would strongly argue, however, that his compatriot is now tailor-made for the current situation at Parkhead.

New challenge: Aleksandr Tonev has joined Celtic after finding his chances at Villa Park limited

Having urged Tonev to seize the chance of a year-long loan move at the ground he once graced, Petrov firmly believes the 24-year-old will recapture top form in Glasgow. He looks at the style of play Ronny Deila wants to implement and sees Tonev as a perfect fit.

The Bulgarian international, capped 15 times, completed his move on Monday night and is expected to go straight into Deila’s squad for the Champions League qualifier against Maribor next week.

‘The biggest strength Tonev has is his pace,’ said Petrov, who earned hero status at Celtic between 1999 and 2006. ‘Honestly, in footballing terms, he is lightning quick.

‘He is also equally comfortable on either foot and switches from left to right without any difficulty. He can score goals and will provide plenty of assists. He is also strong.

‘I believe the new Celtic manager has had Tonev on his radar for quite some time and he will be pleased to get him. He will fit into the new system very well. 

‘I’m positive Tonev will do well for Celtic. He is hungry to do well and desperate to play football and enjoy it once again. That is important.

‘The last year at Aston Villa has been difficult for him but he has the mentality to put that behind him and concentrate on being successful at his new club.

‘He called me from Glasgow yesterday to say he already he has a really good feeling about the club and that they have been very professional in their early dealings with him. The club has made sure he has been made to feel welcome and has everything he needs.’

Neil Lennon was keen on landing Tonev last summer and the player may well wish he had taken up that option given his travails in England.

As it was, Lennon was pipped at the post by Lambert and Tonev took up residence in the Midlands.

Petrov still lives in that part of the country after retiring from playing at Villa following a gruelling battle against leukaemia. He took Tonev under his wing to try and help him settle in his new surroundings.

When it became clear the winger’s future opportunities under Lambert were going to be limited, Petrov then delivered a pristine reference to his old employers at Parkhead.

He has also remained a sounding board for Tonev and dispelled any doubts the younger man may have had about moving north of the border.

‘I told Tonev to join,’ said Petrov. ‘It was as simple as that.

‘He asked me about the history of the club and the supporters and I told him I had seven incredible years at Celtic and loved life in Glasgow and playing in front of the fantastic supporters inside a packed Celtic Park. But I wanted to leave to test myself in England and I also had a great time at Villa.

‘He is well aware there huge demands at Celtic and that he will be expected to help the team win every game. He has the mentality to cope with that pressure.

‘I’m sure the Celtic supporters will enjoy his style of play and they will take them to their hearts very quickly. I know he can help the club do well and would love to play in the Champions League qualifier against Maribor.’

There will be Celtic fans who question the ambition shown the club in making another loan move – following Jo Inge Berget’s arrival from Cardiff City – but it could also perhaps be viewed as a reflection on some of their recent transfer dealings.

There would surely be some within Parkhead happy to have had the option to return the likes of Amido Balde or Derk Boerrigter to their former clubs after their unconvincing initial efforts.

And while it’s true that few tears have been shed in Birmingham over Tonev’s exit, he does bring something that was sorely lacking in the 6-1 aggregate defeat from Legia Warsaw. Celtic looked dismally pedestrian for much of that two-legged tie and an injection of pace is urgently required if Deila’s vision for the team is to be realised.

The Norwegian manager will stand or fall on landing the right players and making them shine in his system. In that respect, he must hope Petrov’s glowing appraisal of Tonev proves accurate.
