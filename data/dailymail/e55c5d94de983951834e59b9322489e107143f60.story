France's National Front descended into further disarray today after its founder threatened to expose his daughter and the party's leader for stabbing him in the back.

Jean Marie Le Pen, who launched the right-wing party in 1972, accused his daughter Marine Le Pen of betraying him after the party pulled his video blog from the internet this week amid claims he made an anti-semitic quip.

Police were also looking in to a 'mysterious' £800,000, reports last night indicated.

Detective are looking at doantions to the National Front of more than one million euros, which Mr Le Pen insists are legitimate.

Le Pen 
rebuked her father last weekend for what she called a 'political 
mistake' after he used a term linked to the French word for 'oven' when 
talking about a Jewish singer - a remark that critics said was an 
implied reference to the death camps of the Holocaust.

And now he is threatening to publish an 
explosive letter he has written to her despite desperate pleas from 
party chiefs to destroy it for fear that it could split the family and even the party, party insiders say.

Today he claimed to have fallen victim of a conspiracy to freeze him out of the party, led by his own daughter.

'My daughter has stabbed me in the back,' he told Les Inrocks, a cultural magazine. 'If I get on their nerves, the only thing for them to do is to kill me. I’m not going to commit suicide.'

In another 
interview, with Le Monde, he grumbled that no one had contacted him 
about the removal of his blog and that he wanted it reinstated.

However, a source close to the National Front’s 
leader, tole The Times newspaper that the patriarch’s anger was not based in politics. 'It’s
 just jealousy,' the source said. 'He can’t stand the idea that she is doing better than he
 ever did.'

Firebrand: Jean-Marie Le Pen was criticised by Jewish groups and prominent members of his own party over the weekend for the comment made in a video posted on the National Front's website last Friday

The latest imbroglio to befall the far-right party was sparked at the weekend when M Le Pen made a ‘joke’ in 
which he appeared to suggest that a popular French Jewish singer, 
Patrick Bruel, should be put into an oven.

Marine
 Le Pen accused him of making a ‘political mistake’, and said the 
incident gave her the opportunity ‘to remind people that the FN condemns any form of anti-Semitism in the strongest terms’.

When asked about one of his party's critics - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel (pictured) - Mr Le Pen said he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 'oven'

While
 Marine Le Pen said her father's comment had been misinterpreted, two 
days later his blog and all links leading to it had been removed from 
the National Front's official web site.

Her
 father then hit back by attacking Mlle Le Pen, 45, for turning the 
party into a more mainstream organisation since taking the reins in 2011
 – a policy that led to huge success in the recent European elections, 
when the Front National took first place in France with 25 per cent of 
the vote.

‘I
 consider that the serious political error is made by those who align 
themselves with political correctness,’ the 85-year-old said. ‘They want
 to be like the other parties.’

M
 Le Pen had said Bruel would be part of ‘a batch [of critics] we will 
get next time’ – using the word fournée for batch, evoking the word four
 which means oven in French.

M Le Pen was re-elected as an MEP in the elections, but 
this did not stop him making a pun referring to the Nazi gas chambers 
during World War II.

In a 
video posted on the FN website, and posted on YouTube, the 85-year-old 
attacks a number of the party's critics, including pop star Madonna.

When
 asked about another - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel - M Le Pen said 
he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 
'oven'.

Thousands of French Jews were sent to German concentration camps during the war, where most were murdered.

A spokesman for SOS Racism, a leading 
Paris civil rights group, described M Le Pen's pun as 'the worst kind 
of anti-Semitic filth'.

Le Pen is already facing a police corruption probe over the mysterious acquisition of more than €1 million, funds he says come from the reimbursement of debts and an inheritance.
