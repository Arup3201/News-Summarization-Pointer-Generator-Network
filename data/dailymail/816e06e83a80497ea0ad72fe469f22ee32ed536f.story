David Cameron today refused to answer a maths question - in case he got it wrong.

The Prime Minister backed plans for every child to be tested on their times table when they leave primary school.

But he ducked a question on what is nine times eight, hours after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also insisted: 'I'm not going to answer any maths questions.'

Prime Minister David Cameron took part in a science lesson, during a visit to Kingsmead School in Enfield, London, but he ducked out of answering maths questions

The Tories have declared  'war on illiteracy and innumeracy' as part of a new Conservative drive to improve standards.

Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Tories Conservatives are returned to power.

As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use 'accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar'.

By the time they leave primary school all 11 year-olds will be able to read a novel, write a short story and recite their times tables up to 12.

But Mr Cameron ducked a maths challenge when answering questions following a speech in north London.

Asked by 5 News political editor Andy Bell to calculate nine times eight, Mr Cameron responded: 'I'm going to plead the Nicky Morgan defence, which is I do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school.

'I'm going to stick to that just in case I get one wrong on your excellent television programme.' 

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted every 11-year-old should know their times tables, but ducked a maths question on TV

Earlier Mrs Morgan insisted it was needed to prepare pupils for later life but turned bashful when put on the spot BBC Breakfast.

Laughing as she realised her times tables were about to be put to the test, she said: 'If it's going to be a times table question then the answer is going to be the same as I have given all the other interviewers this morning, which is I think that actually children at home are going to want to say 'I know better than the Education Secretary'. They can do that.

'I'm not going to answer any maths questions. I've made that very clear.'

She also dodged the question when appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'No I'm not going to be answering any because at the end of the day I know what it's like with all these interviews, I will be doing lots of interviews this morning and there'll be one where I get it [the answer] wrong and that's the one that everyone is going to be focussing on.

'We are going to have a number of years to make sure we get our young people ready and able to answer those questions.' 

Questioned by presenter Bill Turnbull, Mrs Morgan said: 'I'm not going to answer any maths questions. I've made that very clear'

In 1998 Labour's schools standards minister Stephen Byers was asked: What is seven times eight.

He declared it (wrongly) to be 54 - having just called for pupils to learn their times tables back in 1998.

Last year Chancellor George Osborne ducked exactly the same question when pressed on television by an inquisitive seven-year-old, saying that he had made it a rule in life 'not to answer a whole load of maths questions'.

In 2013 Sports Minister Helen Grant could not get a single right answer when she faced a series of on-air questions about football, rugby, tennis and the Paralympics.

Asked who the FA Cup holders were. A slightly anxious-looking Mrs Grant said: 'Come on, help,' before replying: 'Manchester United because it's my favourite club.' The correct answer was Wigan Athletic. 

And David Cameron could not come up with the answer to one of the most basic question of all - what is the price of a loaf of bread - having to fall back on the excuse that he made his own using an electronic bread-maker.

But she insisted that it was right to carry out tests on pupils before they leave primary school.

She told BBC Breakfast: 'We want every child to have the best start in life, and obviously that means getting it right from primary right the way through to secondary.

'This is not about saying heads will automatically be replaced. This is about saying where a school doesn't have the capacity to improve itself - and many do - or where they don't have a plan to lead that school to being rated good or outstanding, which I think is what we want for all of our children, then yes ... one of the answers is to get new leadership in.

'But there are some fantastic headteachers up and down this country who would be going and offering support to those schools and their heads.'

She said the policy would foster 'collaboration' between schools to produce the best results.

'Education can be life-transforming, and that means we have to give every child the best possible start in life to fulfil their potential.'

Mrs Morgan said that 'just enough is not good enough' for pupils, and insisted the policy would help British schools 'compete with the best in the world'.

Since replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary last summer, Mrs Morgan has studiously avoided putting her academic abilities to the test on camera.

Last year she was asked by a 10-year-old pupil a 10-year-old pupil what the cube root of 125 is.

But she laughed it of saying: 'I think it is probably better that politicians don't do maths or spelling on air.'
