The government theory that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone was not enough to convince many Americans following the President's assassination, including his own brother.

Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General at the time, immediately suspected that the CIA had something to do with the President's death in Dallas.

President Kennedy and the CIA had butted heads on a number of occasions during his nearly three years in office, and his younger brother thought that a disgruntled member of the clandestine organization may have taken their outrage too far.

Tense: Some suspected CIA involvement because CIA director Allen Dulles was forced to resign following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion just months into Kennedy's presidency (pictured together in July 1960)

Denial: Bobby Kennedy (right), who was the Attorney General at the time, met with then-CIA director John McClune (left) who assured him that there was no agency involvement in the President's assassination

'Apparently Bobby Kennedy’s first suspicion was that it was some rogue element in the CIA,' author Philip Shenon said in his new book about the assassination.

Those fears were not completely unsubstantiated, as CIA director Allen Dulles and President Kennedy disagreed on the failed Bay of Pigs operation.

Dulles ended up resigning in early 1962 after the bid to kill Castro went belly-up and questions lingered about how upset Dulles- and his subordinates- were about the ousting.

As such, Bobby Kennedy initially is thought to have suspected a splinter group of agents rather than a formal, bureaucratically approved overation. 

Fatal ride: President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie were in the back of the open-top convertible during their drive through Dallas on November 22, 1963

Warren Commission: After initial concerns, Bobby Kennedy asked Dulles (second from right) to be a part of the investigating committee who compiled the formal report on the assassination

In the end those concerns were put to rest after the younger Kennedy had a private conversation with the sitting CIA director, John McClune who promised that no one from the agency had a part in the assassination- the fourth in United States history. 

On top of that, the hard feelings between Kennedy and Dulles- who was appointed as the Director of the CIA under his predecessor, President Eisenhower- were purely professional and not personal.

'Apparently the Kennedy family had no particular hostility toward Dulles,' Mr Shenon told NBC News.

The CIA has repeatedly put out statements denying any involvement.

Perhaps out of that respect or in an effort to lend credibility to the group of officials who were tasked with investigating the assassination, Bobby appointed Dulles to be a member of the Warren Commission.

Still believers: A majority of Americans- 61%- think that there were other people involved in Kennedy's assassination

Aftermath: Bobby Kennedy was at his his sister-in-law's side as she arrived back in Washington in her blood-stained suit following her husband's murder

The Commission determined- after almost a year of interviews and meetings- that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, that one of the three bullets that Oswald fired from the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository fired the fatal blow to President Kennedy while also striking Governor Connally, and that Jack Ruby was self-motivated in his decision to shoot Oswald.

The latest Gallup poll reports that to this day, there are a majority of Americans who do not believe the Warren Commission's findings.

The poll found 61 per cent of Americans believe that it was not solely a lone shooter, but there were others involved.

While that percentage is the lowest found by the surveying company since the late 1960s in the years immediately following the assassination.
