He might be less than impressed by the Chinese record on human rights but that wasn't enough to stop Prince Charles from visiting London's Chinatown to help usher in the Year of the Sheep.

The Prince of Wales was on cheerful form and joked with performers dressed as dragons as he took in the colourful scene.

With him was the Duchess of Cornwall, who cut an elegant figure in a pretty cream cashmere skirt and jacket by Anna Valentine and a delicate printed silk scarf.

What did he say? Charles bursts into laughter after sharing a joke with the performer

As well as taking in the sights, the royal couple were in Chinatown to open the China Exchange, a purpose-built exhibition space destined to become a hub for theatrical and arts performances.

During the visit, Prince and Duchess were introduced to a number of Chinese traditions, including calligraphy and dumpling making - both of which Camilla pulled off with aplomb.

Charles grinned as his wife attempted to make dim sum in the shape of fold and silver ingots, which are believed to bring you luck and prosperity, before watching a chop stick demonstration.

Camilla was a little more reluctant to try the trickier art of Chinese calligraphy but was praised for her 'impressive' first try at the character representing 'sky.

While Prince Charles chose not to show off his cooking skills, he did make a speech in which he revealed he and Camilla were 'thrilled' to be there and made an attempt at wishing revellers a Happy New Year in Cantonese.

Looking good: Charles was accompanied by his wife, who looked lovely in a cream cashmere suit

'Xin Nian Hao [Happy New Year]!' Charles told the crowds, adding: 'I rather hope the [Chinese] Ambassador [Liu Xiaoming] will give me a tutorial after.'

He also cracked a joke about finding it difficult to tell the difference between the Cantonese for sheep and goat, both of which are called 'yáng', in a reference to the new Year of the Sheep.

The eighth sign in the 12-year Chinese cycle, sheep are considered to be lucky in China and thus, sheep years are usually thought to be auspicious, particularly for finances.

In Chinese astrology, people born in sheep years are said to be peace-loving, kind and popular but also clingy and resistant to change.

Born in 1948, Prince Charles entered the world in the Year of the Rat, which, apparently, makes him charming but aggressive, talkative and sometimes stubborn.

Charles, who did plenty of chatting during the visit, was also in Chinatown to highlight the work of the Prince's Charities Foundation China, which was established by the Prince in 2008.

Clever: The dumplings were shaped to resemble ingots of gold and silver and are thought to bring fortune

Based in Hong Kong, it aims to 'promote mutual understanding' between people from the UK and China. 

Another of his charities, the Foundation for Building Community, also played a role in supporting and developing the concept for the China Exchange.

In his address, which was made to members of the community and benefactors of the centre, he  hoped the building 'will be a platform for the exchange of ideas between the East and the West'.

Finishing with a flourish, he ended the speech by revealing that he and Camilla were 'delighted to join you in celebrating the Chinese New Year'.

Speaking after the visit, Geoffrey Leong, owner of Dumplings' Legend which was visited by the royal couple, said: 

'The first day of the New Year is the best day to take part in Chinese traditions, it means it will certainly be a lucky and happy year for [Charles and Camilla].'

He added: 'We spoke about all the different animals and I told Prince Charles that I believed he was the year of the rat and Camilla was the year of the pig - I wasn't sure if he already knew that.

'Everyone in Chinatown is delighted that they have come here to celebrate with us. We are a big part of the London community so it's great to see them taking pleasure in these traditions.' 

Nearly done: The Duchess furrowed her brow in concentration as she neatly filled her dim sum

Difficult: The Duchess was a little reluctant to try calligraphy but eventually managed to complete a word

Nicely done: The Duchess' calligraphy was made up of two characters that spelled the word 'sky'

Ta da: Her efforts were met with a round of applause, with her tutors calling the work 'impressive'

Well-earned: Both Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a cup of tea at The China Exchange
