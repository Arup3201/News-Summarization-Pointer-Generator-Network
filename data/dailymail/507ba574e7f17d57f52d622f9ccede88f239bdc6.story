A man is being hailed a hero from across the Atlantic after saving a drowning workmate from the bottom of a ferocious 80ft waterfall.

Businessman Garry Smith braved the plunge-pool of the 80ft waterfall in the US after his colleague, Suresh Nath, 44, fell into the torrent and was knocked unconscious.

After swimming to his aid and dragging him to safety, Mr Smith used the lifesavingÂ  skills he'd picked up as a volunteer lifeguard to get his friend breathing again - performing CPR until emergency services arrived.

Now the 59-year-old, a technical director for oil and gas industry supplier Howco, is to be honoured with a bravery award.

Mr Smith said: 'It's an event I would rather of not happened in the first place. It's humbling, and not something I would have gone around shouting about because it's a situation I wouldn't like anybody to get into.

'But if it alerts people to the importance of learning to swim that's okay. This guy had never learned how to swim, and it's a key life skill.'

The grandfather from Sheffield, south Yorkshire has worked at the company for 16 years and was in the US to do some work for the American branch of the firm.

He and his American colleague, Mr Nath, 44, had some free time after completing their day's work and the pair decided to visit Ithaca Falls in New York state.

Mr Smith said: ' 'I stopped to take a photo, looked up and my colleague had disappeared. I'd completely lost sight of him.

'When I looked up I saw him, fully clothed, in the water.

'He had walked towards the waterfall to take a photo along the side of it, stood on a small rock which acted like a ball bearing, lost his footing and went straight over the edge.

'I realised he was drowning and in serious trouble.'

The father-of-three rushed to find something to save Mr Nath, but realised he was rapidly running out of time.

Mr Smith continued: 'There were two women nearby having a picnic so I asked them to call the emergency services.

'At first I tried to find a branch to pull him out with but he was being dragged under the water. I had no option but to help. My heart was saying I should go in but my head was saying it was dangerous.

'I started to wade into the water until I had to swim. At this point he was upside down and unconscious, so I pulled him to the edge of the water.

'There was no sign of life. He wasn't in a good state and I started giving him mouth to mouth.

'After about five minutes the emergency services appeared and took over.'

The oil worker had learned lifesaving skills as he volunteered for a swimming club in Sheffield and later Concord leisure centres for a number of years.

Mr Nath spent three days in hospital but made a full recovery and is now back at work.

Speaking of his family's feelings about the incident Mr Smith said: 'We've not really said too much about it really because it's not something anybody wants to happen.

'I do know they are proud though, especially now.'

The Mayor of Ithaca and the Chief of Police have arranged for Mr Smith to be awarded with a Medal for Bravery at a ceremony in Sheffield.

Howco sales and marketing director Tim Birch said: 'In a very traumatic situation and knowing the risks involved, Garry's quick thinking saved the life of his friend and colleague.

'Garry is a valued senior member of the team at Howco and is a very honourable,loyal and selfless employee.

'His noble actions on the day typify the person he is - helping people in any way, under any circumstance, both professionally and personally.'
