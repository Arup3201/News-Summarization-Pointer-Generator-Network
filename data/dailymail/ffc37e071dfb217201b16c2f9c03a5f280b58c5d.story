Poignant floral tributes including one with a note saying 'sorry we couldn't save you' have been left where a young woman was killed  when a giant window frame fell on top of her as she passed by.

The tragic redhead, believed to be in her 20s, was fatally injured when a gust of wind dislodged the concrete frame and hit her as she ate a banana in front of shocked shoppers yesterday.

It came from a multi-million-pound six-storey office block in Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London, and today flowers and messages have been placed metres from where the giant frame still lies.

The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said this morning they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.'

Tragedy:
 A heavy four metre high window frame that had been propped up against a
 wall fell on top of the woman as she passed by Hanover Square, just off
 Oxford Street, in central London

Shock:
 The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new 
multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to 
the scene and battle to save the woman but she was declared dead

A police spokeswoman said both the police and Health and Safety Executive would probe the incident and the young lady was unlikely to be named until this weekend at the earliest.

She said a post mortem would be done tomorrow morning at Westminster's Coroners Court, and then her identity will be revealed.

The spokeswoman added: 'It a joint investigation between the Metropolitan Police Service and the health and safety executive.

'The post mortem is scheduled for tomorrow morning at Westminster's Coroners Court.

'We believe we know the identification of the woman but no formal identification has been done at this stage.

'I believe her family has been informed.

'There have been no arrests.'

Last night witnesses claimed the ‘very
 heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, 
and that  barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed.

The accident happened at 11.30am in 
Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive 
offices. 

An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, 
the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite.

Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high 
frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I
 saw the frames delivered yesterday,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they
 were lifted in by crane.’

Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane

Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive have launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds

A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off  the woman

Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby 
Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn 
left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana.

‘The next thing they saw was this 
window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so 
quickly.’ 

A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who 
did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the 
frame off  the woman.

‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ 
he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground. I was hoping 
it was a coat underneath – but then I saw an arm.

‘There was a woman who said she was a doctor who wanted to perform CPR, and somebody was giving her mouth-to-mouth.

‘Her eyes were open and I saw her hand
 move and then I saw her last breath, and then the light went out – 
she’d gone. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

Building site: Workmen were installing windows in a six-storey office block in Hanover Square in London when the incident happened

Beverley Hazel, from Kennington, South London, was on her way to work at 11.30am when she saw the woman lying in the road.

She said: ‘She was very young and 
slight. I’ve got two daughters, one younger and one older than this 
woman. I was in bits. If it had been my daughter I would have wanted 
someone with her.’

A spokesman for Westgreen Construction
 Ltd, of Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, which is managing the building 
project,  said: ‘We will do whatever is necessary. This is a terrible 
accident.’

The woman’s body, which had been covered by a yellow police tent, was removed by a private ambulance at 6.45pm yesterday.

The Health and Safety Executive said  
it was ‘making initial inquiries’. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said 
last night that the investigation was ‘ongoing’.
