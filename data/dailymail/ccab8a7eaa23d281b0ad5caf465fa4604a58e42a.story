'Killed over conkers': Steven Grisales, 21, died from a single knife wound to heart after telling youngsters to stop chucking conkers at him

The mother of a 21-year-old who was attacked after he asked a group of youths to stop pelting him with conkers has described her son as perfect and said he always respected others.

Jasmid Grisales, 43, said she was devastated that her son would now not be able to fulfil his dream of becoming an architect.

She also said she had brought her children up to be respectful of others and said parents with little or no money should stop blaming the government and start teaching their children the difference between right and wrong.

'I see people saying, "Our children have nothing, they cannot do anything but go to the streets". That is not true.

'Steven went to karate, to other extra clubs, I count my pennies to pay. People say it's the Government's fault. It's not, where are the parents? I've been doing my bit, teaching my children to do right.'

Mrs Grisales said she was trying to stay strong for her three other children, Nicole, 11, Isabella, six, and 2-year-old Alexander but found it difficult to believe her son would not be coming home.

Describing him as a 'funny, caring and respectful boy' she explained how he would regularly call her if he spotted a building he loved.

Brought up in a quiet area of Enfield, Steven had won an architectural scholarship at Westminster College and would have been due to enrol the day he died.

After helping his grandmother with her weekly shop, he ate one of her Colombian dishes and called home to say he was on his way.

He was due to stay at her house but had forgotten his passport which he needed so that he could register at college the following day.

Tragically, he was stabbed in the heart near Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, North London, after he asked a group of people to stop pelting him with conkers.

His mother, who said she moved here 20 years ago to escape this type of violence, said her son had just returned from Argentina where he had been working with his father for the past four years.

An outstanding and determined pupil he had obtained his GCSEs and A Levels so he could get a degree.

The area in North London is becoming notorious for this type of violence and on Wednesday night, another teenager was killed near to the same spot where Steven was stabbed.

The teenage boy, known locally by his nickname Andre 
‘Yardie’, is in a serious but stable condition.

He was also walking to the same train station when he was pounced upon at about 6.50pm in College Close, Edmonton.

A witness said: ‘Yardie seemed to be arguing in the playground with another boy. One called the other “moist”.’

Another witness said: ‘He isn’t the sort of guy who would start trouble. He isn’t in a gang.’

Two people have been arrested over the stabbing, Scotland Yard said. Detectives were said to be 'unaware' of any link with the murder Steven.

Just an hour after the teenager was attacked, a man in his 50s was knifed in nearby Victoria Road, the BBC reported.

Last month, Leroy James, 14, was stabbed to death in a nearby playground in a suspected territorial dispute between gangs.

Steven's grieving
father Andre wept at the scene of his eldest child's death as he said 
he could not understand why his son was killed and said it would not have happened in Colombia where the family live and he works.

Yards apart: A teenager was stabbed close to where 'good boy' Stephen Grisakes was attacked

A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder and has appeared in court, while another boy, also 15, has been questioned.

A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl have already been arrested and released on bail.

Mr Grisales, with his heartbroken wife
Jasmid, described Steven as a 'good boy' who had done nothing wrong 
before he was stabbed.

The aspiring architect, who was born 
in Britain but whose parents are Colombian, had returned to the UK three
and a half weeks ago from Argentina. His father has been working there 
and the teenager was spending time with him.

Mr Grisales said his son did not drink or smoke and was not into gangs. He said: 'It's devastating for all of us, the whole family - aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles - back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it. We don't understand. Without a reason, without nothing.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at 
the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station. 

'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.'

Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male.

A
local resident heard Steven scream and ran outside to try and help, but
the injuries were so severe she was powerless to save him.

Floral tributes were left on College Close, near to the murder scene

A resident said: ‘All the kids carry knives. I see them playing with them like they are toys.’

Witnesses are urged to call the incident room on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
