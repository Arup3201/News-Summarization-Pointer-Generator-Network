As Chris Smalling continues his efforts to convince Louis van Gaal he is worth another contract at Manchester United, he is safe in the knowledge Roy Hodgson has always admired his qualities, ever since a chance first encounter.

Hodgson signed Smalling from non-league Maidstone United, seven years ago, soon after Les Reed, Fulham's director of football, had invited the 18-year-old centre-half along to a trial at the club's training ground in Surrey.

'He was watching by chance and he pulled me into his office and it all started from there,' said Smalling. 'I can't remember the whole conversation, it's a bit of a blur, but Roy was very encouraging.

Smalling is thankful for Hodgson and is delighted they can rekindle their relationship at England

'He mentioned in conversation that he'd played for Maidstone. It was quite surreal. I didn't know many other people who had played for Maidstone.

'I came back for a week to train with the reserves, and was offered a contract a month or so later. He's the one who really got it started for me and it's nice to rekindle that with England. I hope my performances for my club help him to keep selecting me.'

Hodgson, who played for Maidstone in the early 70s, convinced Smalling he had a career in professional football, although the youngster decided to complete his A-levels first.

There were university places on offer to study financial economics at Leicester or Loughborough if he secured three Bs in his exams, which he did.

'I was planning to go to university but a month or two before my exams I was offered trials by Fulham and Middlesbrough,' said Smalling. 'I had nothing to lose and gave it my all.

'I'd been at Millwall until I was about 15. It was quite far to travel and I was missing some sessions, so I wasn't really developing, and then I went to Maidstone.'

His education did little to impress Van Gaal, earlier this season, when the Manchester United boss branded Smalling 'stupid' for a red card, during the first half of the derby against City.

'I was foolish, and it was a rush of blood,' said Smalling. 'You learn more from yourself than from what managers and fans say. It's something I've not done too often and hopefully it won't happen again. I've learnt not to get caught up in these situations. I try not to clock up too many cards, but that was a moment of madness.'

The same could be said for his decision to attend a fancy dress party last year in a Jager-bomber costume, with an Arabian headscarf, shades, a flak-jacket and bottles of Jagermeister and Red Bull strapped to his body.

After being close to going to university, Smalling is now an England international and trophy winner

'There's always people out there that are trying to pick you up, and as a role model for young players you have to make sure you're on the ball,' he said. 'That's something you only learn as you get older.

'It's more a case of common sense really, but there are older players there if you do need some advice. It was one of those things. There are a lot of things that happen that sometimes get blown up. In general that's rare for me.'

Niggling injuries have proved more disruptive since he left Fulham for Old Trafford in 2010, but he is back in the team and has delivered some impressive performances as Van Gaal's United started to click.

He was excellent in the win at Liverpool, frustrating Mario Balotelli in the process, and was looking forward to another duel with the striker in Turin until he discovered Balotelli has been omitted from the squad for the friendly against England.

'If you're doing your job and not giving the striker much of a chance he'll probably get angry, and Balotelli is someone who can lose his temper very quickly,' said Smalling. 'If I'm shutting down the striker, I'm happy to see them get frustrated.

'I thought it could be round two on Tuesday, but I've seen he's not in the squad so we'll have to wait for that.'

Smalling's good form offered encouragement to those who believe the 25-year-old may yet prove to be a long-term successor to Rio Ferdinand.

'I've been able to clock up a run of games in the past few months,' he said. 'The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and I've been able to stay fit. It' s nice to get a good run, it helps you become more confident and to put your personality on the game.

'Rio was a defender I really admired for the way he put his character and personality onto the pitch. He's not just your everyday defender. You can see his character in the way he wants to play football. That's something young players can pick up on.

'When I joined it was a case of playing with him for a good few years and picking up a lot of points. Eventually when he did move on I felt I was ready and it was an opportunity for me to show myself.

'When you have the shirt, everyone else is fighting it out and trying to push you out of the way. When that time comes you need to make sure you're in a good run of form so the manager feels you are the one who should step in.'

The process has been complicated since by injuries, managerial changes at Old Trafford, his own versatility and Van Gaal's habit of switching between three and four at the back.

With Champions League qualification close to being secured, the defender can look forward to Europe

'I've not had too many different managers and this is my first foreign coach,' said Smalling. 'He's really worked hard on the training field right from the double sessions in pre-season. We've had the tactics, and quite a lot of meetings in terms of the vision he wants.

'He wants more from the centre-halves on the ball, rather than taking the easy option and passing to the full-back when the room is too narrow that they can't really do much with the ball.

'The manager does stress why pass it to him when you've got no-one marking you. I am enjoying that responsibility. Sir Alex wanted us to play out, but there's more emphasis on that now.

'Growing up, first of all you're a defender but we have more possession than a lot of teams and we have to be a bit more like the midfield and start moves.'

Smalling's contract expires next year. As someone who had the chance to study financial economics, you might think he would be all over the details, but he is in no rush.

'It's not something I really want to focus on,' he said. 'It's not really come into my head. I'm enjoying it at United. I'm focusing on the rest of the season. I'm happy as ever because I'm playing and hopefully I can keep contributing.'
