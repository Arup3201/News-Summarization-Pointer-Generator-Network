Paul Scholes was only seen in the red of Manchester United during his glittering playing career, but the former midfielder has finally got his hands on a new shirt.

The 39-year-old has been pictured showing off the 2014/15 away kit of Oldham Athletic - the team he has supported since he was a young boy.

The League One side shared an image of their most famous fan holding their bright new shirt on Instagram, along with the caption: 'Football legend Paul Scholes has got his new Latics away shirt - have you got yours? #oafc'

Game over: Scholes hung up his boots in 2013 after an illustrious career at Old Trafford

Scholes, who helped coach the Red Devils' first team when Ryan Giggs was placed in temporary charge towards the end of last season, spent his entire career at Old Trafford before retiring in 2013.

But he has always had a strong affection for the Latics and often travels to Boundary Park to watch the Football League side in action.

The ex-England international also linked up with Oldham boss Lee Johnson late last year to help coach his boyhood side, with the art of pinpoint long passes and unstoppable volleys sure to have been on his agenda.

Johnson admitted that the door would always be open for Scholes to put his boots back on and star in the Latics' midfield if he fancied dropping down a couple of divisions.

Option: Oldham boss Lee Johnson has left the door open for Scholes to sign for the League One club

'I’m sure if he fancied it he’d have let us know by now,' Johnson said in December last year.

‘I respect Paul Scholes enough to not ask him but Simon (Corney - Oldham chairman) will get in the mix of anything.

‘You’re talking about a world class player that’s retired after a world class career. Why would he want to spoil that adulation by playing for me?

‘Listen – the door’s open. Even to Maradona. I’m sure I could get him 10 minutes.’
