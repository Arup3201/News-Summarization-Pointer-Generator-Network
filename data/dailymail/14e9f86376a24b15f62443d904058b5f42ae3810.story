Rio Ferdinand has admitted he is disappointed not to have the chance to play under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.

The centre-back left Old Trafford when his contract ran out at the end of the domestic season in May, and now looks set for a move to recently-promoted QPR.

When asked if he felt he had missed out by leaving before the Dutchman arrived in the Premier League, the defender said: ‘Yes, a little bit. But you can’t cry over spilt milk, it happened.

‘It’s a new era now and I wish him well. I hope they do well and go on to win the league next year. Time will tell.

‘I think he’ll come in and do things a bit differently to how they were done before, so hopefully that will be a good thing.’

Speaking to TheRepublikOfMancunia.com while helping to promote EA SPORTS UFC, the 35-year-old said it will not be until he does not return to Carrington for pre-season training that he realises the magnitude of his decision to leave United.

‘When pre-season starts it’ll probably hit home a bit more. I went to pick up a few bags the other day and I got a little bit choked up sitting in my car, thinking this is the last time I’m going to be seeing this place.

‘Of course it’s emotional because I’m leaving with a lot of memories.

‘I only found out I wouldn’t be staying on the last day of the season so I didn’t get a chance to go back in.

‘This was an opportunity to say goodbye to all the dinner ladies and everyone there who made my life easier. It was my chance just to say thank you.’

Controversy: Ferdinand says his meeting with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon in 2005 was by chance

Ferdinand also discussed the drama surrounding his meeting with Chelsea’s chief executive Peter Kenyon at a restaurant in London in 2005.

The meeting saw his popularity among United fans plummet, particularly as it came during negotiations over a new contract at Old Trafford and just after he had completed his eight-month ban.

‘I explain that in my new book, but I just want to reiterate that I was never a part of that meeting,’ said the former England international.

‘I bumped into my agent and he was sat with Peter Kenyon. It was literally just a case of me popping in to say hello. I don’t even think I ordered a drink!

‘I left after 10 or 15 minutes, but somebody obviously took a photo. A snapshot of a moment can lead to so many stories.’

Ferdinand said his on-pitch relationship with Nemanja Vidic, who will leave United to join Inter Milan this summer, was the best of his career.

'Playing alongside each other for so many years we were so successful together,’ he explained.

‘Off the pitch there have been so many – at the beginning there was Wes Brown and then Wayne Rooney.

‘Obviously Michael Carrick and myself both came through at West Ham so we always had that relationship.

‘But I’m lucky in that I’ve got a great relationship loads of the lads – Scholesy [Paul Scholes], Giggsy [Ryan Giggs], Fletch [Darren Fletcher], Robin [van Persie], Wazza [Rooney], Welbz [Danny Welbeck]…it’s not fair for me to name just one because I’m good pals with all of them.’

And when asked if his support for the Old Trafford club might waiver now that he has left, he quickly dismissed the suggestion.

‘I’ll be a United supporter for the rest of my life, so will my kids. It’s in me now, so I can’t get rid of it!’
