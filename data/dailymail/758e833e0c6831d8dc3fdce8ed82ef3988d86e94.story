Abdullah Elmir Fled Australia with one other teenager where it is believed they will join insurgents fighting in Iraq

A Sydney teenager who fled Australia and is believed to be planning to join the conflict in Iraq may have been brainwashed after watching Jihadist recruitment videos posted online.

The lawyer for the family of missing teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, has told Daily Mail Australia that he was most likely recruited to join an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone.

Lawyer Zali Burrows said she could not confirm the content of the videos or the group(s) responsible, but did say that it was likely he was offered an 'inducement' to fly to Iraq to fight.

Elmir disappeared from the family's home in Bankstown, western Sydney, more than a week ago and he has only once made contact to tell his mother he was in Turkey.

Ms Burrows and the family said they now want to know who paid for the teenager's ticket to fly and why, at just 17, he was allowed to fly with another teenager unknown to the family.

Elmir lied to his parents about 'going fishing', then vanished.

It has been reported that he may be planning to cross the border into Iraq.

An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'

Ms Burrow claims Elmir's actions are out of character and that he had shown no signs of radical behaviour before leaving.

The family also said they do no know why he would abandon his family and the promise of a university education.

Elmir is the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family this month bound for Iraq.

Speaking to The Sun Herald, the family described him as a normal child, who enjoyed a simple life in Sydney's west.

The family only learnt of his travel arrangements to Iraq via a text message he left with a friend which simply said to tell his mother he was 'gone'.

The family said they hold grave concerns for his safety and fear he may 'never be seen again'.

'We wish for his safety and we want the government to help bring him home,' a family member told Fairfax Media.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment due to privacy obligations.

Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in either Syria or Iraq so the Government's ability to deliver assistance in the Middle East is limited.

Ms Burrows says she is convinced the Government knew that Abdullah was leaving.

A family member told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'What is concerning is that if the Federal Police and ASIO had the intelligence, then why did they fail to stop him from departing or fail to stop the boy while he was in Turkey?'

Ten Australians have died in Syria and Iraq, the latest a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) shortly before being ambushed in Syria.

More than 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with Middle East extremist groups. Australians involved in extremist activity have been warned by Prime Minister Tony Abbott that the Government will crackdown on home-grown terrorists.

He said: 'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said.

Mr Abbott said that while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in that country's north, Australia would redouble its efforts to protect its national security.
