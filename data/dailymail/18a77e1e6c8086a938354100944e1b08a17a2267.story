A father born without functioning hands is suing Six Flags theme park after he was stopped from riding the Aquaman Splashdown.

Clint Bench, who does not have fully formed hands, says he was 'embarrassed' after being told to get off the ride by staff at the Six Flags Over Texas in front of his children.

In the suit, filed in Dallas federal court, Mr Dench says the amusement park violated the Americans With Disabilities Act.

Clint Bench had bought three season tickets to Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in Arlington but was told he could not ride the Aquaman Splashdown because he has no hands

The father-of-two, from Weatherford, Texas, said when he tried to board the ride last May he was told by an employee to leave 'because he does not have hands', according to Dallas News.

In the suit, Mr Bench said it caused him 'considerable embarrassment' as his children had never seen him discriminated before.

Aquaman riders sit in a boat that travels down into water, causing a large wave to soak them. 

The papers filed on Tuesday say: 'Mr Bench is a physically fit, healthy adult with great 
upper body strength. He can perform all manners of activities, including
activities that one would normally assume would require the use of 
hands.'

He can write, type, tie his shoes, fire a gun and enjoys water skiing and mountain biking and has never considered using prosthetics, it said.

Mr Dench said he was 'embarrassed' and he said his children had never seen him being discriminated against

Mr Bench is suing for an undisclosed amount for 'mental anguish' as well as a refund for the three Six Flags season tickets he had bought and his attorney's fees.

Lawyers for Mr Bench claim the amusement park altered its restriction rules after he made a complaint.

A guide, they claim was written in September, now states that Aquaman riders 'must have one full arm and one full leg.'

Dallas News quoted the papers as saying: 'Mr Bench - who is capable of riding every ride at Six Flags Over Texas, and who has done so many times without injury to himself of others - is now unable to enjoy the rides with his family.;'

It added that people who choose to raise their hands in the air 'in a silly display of bravado' are not prevented from going on further rides.

Sharon Parker, the spokesperson for Six Flags, told Dallas News that she had not seen the suit 'but generally we don’t comment on pending litigation.'
