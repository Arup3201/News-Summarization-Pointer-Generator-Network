The tributes to Phillip Hughes in Australia at the weekend will be led by the doyen of cricket broadcasters, Richie Benaud, who recently announced he was suffering from skin cancer after being hurt in a car crash in Sydney last year.

Benaud will narrate Channel Nine’s slide show on Hughes, which will be screened over the weekend, and will say: ‘A boy, just beginning, 25 years of age, Baggy Green number 408. His father’s best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, for ever rest in peace, son.’

The 30-second slide show includes Hughes’ early cricketing career and family photographs. Hughes died on Thursday from a catastrophic brain injury after being struck by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday.

There has been an outpouring of good will around the world for the popular Hughes, who is particularly fondly remembered at Hampshire, Middlesex and Worcestershire from his time in county cricket, with the Twitter inspired ‘#putoutyourbats’ initiative prominent. 

Cricket Australia also recommended that all batsmen playing in youth matches this weekend should retire on 63, Hughes score when he was hit on the back of the head by a bouncer from Abbott, rather than 50, as is compulsory. 

Two-day club matches will also be played over 63 overs each innings while there will be a 63-second silence for Hughes before each game. Players will also be urged to wear his initials or his Australian Test number, 408.
