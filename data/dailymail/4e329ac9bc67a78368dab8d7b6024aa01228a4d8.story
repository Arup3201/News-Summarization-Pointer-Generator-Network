Angry: Austin Mitchell with his wife Linda 

It's been a bad week for me and my husband, Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby. He’s been bullied and abused by his colleagues in his own party for daring to discuss the future of all-women shortlists.

‘Sexist and misogynistic,’ said Lucy Powell, Shadow Children’s Minister. ‘It’s the old, cloth-eared, macho politics,’ growled Labour aristocrat Dame Tessa Jowell. And Hull East Labour MP Karl Turner joined the ladies, describing his neighbour and colleague as ‘self-serving, chauvinistic, antiquated’.

Austin has been battered all over the media since his article in last week’s Mail on Sunday where he gave his views on selecting many Labour candidates for next year’s Election from all-women shortlists (AWS). Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry MP weighed in with ‘suspect his wife Linda is not amused either, is she?’.

You’re right, Emily. I’m not.

I have, for as long as I can remember, been a feminist. And I have, from their inception before the 1997 Election, been an enthusiastic supporter of AWS. Of the 120 women who became MPs in 1997, 101 were Labour. They changed the face of Westminster for ever. I was so thrilled I wrote a book, Westminster Women.

However, there have been some disturbing trends of late: seats where only one or two women applied, seats fixed in advance for favoured daughters. AWS should not become the ‘old boy network’ in a skirt. Most concerning of all, it appears to have become untouchable. Any suggestion of change or modification is howled down and treated with derision.

Austin wrote a perfectly sensible piece exploring the possibilities for an end to AWS. He was neither hysterical nor misogynist. He said many things I would wholeheartedly support (albeit in less careful language than I’d have used). For this he has been utterly vilified. The Labour Twitterati got their teeth in and held on all week: ‘I cannot wait till your generation finally dies,’ screamed one.

Austin was determined to stand down before the 2015 Election. He’d had serious heart problems in 2013, and it would have been hard to go on with his 80th birthday coming up.

There had been speculation of an AWS in Grimsby since January when Melanie Onn was rumoured to be set to become Labour’s prospective Parliamentary candidate. We began to be worried about the process: was it predestination or a fair choice?

Austin had seen Ed Miliband and the Chief Whip Rosie Winterton several times to discuss the timing of his announcement. Anna Yearley, Ed’s political fixer, was always at the meetings.

Austin says she gently explained to him, as she would to any out-of-touch geriatric, that AWS was for the good of the party, not Grimsby. From then on it unfolded like a plan imposed from above.

Melanie Onn’s name was floated by the leadership as The Chosen One.

Few women applied. A month before polling day it looked as though there might be only two: Melanie and a local councillor. Dozens had applied to be the MP for Grimsby in 1977 when Austin had been selected.

Women want seats that are convenient to get home to. You can’t say that about Grimsby. Female politicians often have needs and responsibilities not experienced by most men. Whatever the Labour sisterhood might tell you, in the real world, women, including politicians, still do most of the childcare and want to spend time with their kids during the working week. A constituency nearer London or on a direct train route gives them a better chance of doing that.

By the time AWS was announced in Grimsby, Melanie had a strong foothold in the local party and was ready to roll, strongly supported by the Unison union. Austin made it clear he would take no part in the selection, but I felt there should be no such inhibition for me.

So I set out to find some good strong women who might be interested. I spoke to several, but could persuade none. Grimsby was too far, too off the beaten track. Nearly all had childcare responsibilities as well as their careers as politicians.

Others had heard Grimsby had been ‘stitched up’ for Melanie. Only Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, bravely decided to give it a go. An experienced campaigner and terrific candidate, she ran Melanie close, winning the first round of an exhaustive ballot, but losing in the end by a handful of votes.

It was a view widely held locally that Melanie had been gifted the seat. The way the Leader’s Office acted, and strong union support gave her a head start. She had more, better, earlier, glossier leaflets, and she was a local party worker, born in the constituency. All the other candidates started behind, and stayed there.

That was the atmosphere in which Austin wrote his piece for The Mail on Sunday. The jihad sisters who’d decided it was best to keep the old boy out of the process until Melanie was safely selected, rose up as one to abuse him. Of course they never bothered to read what he actually wrote. The name Austin Mitchell and AWS in the same sentence was all it needed.

Like trained guerilla fighters, they went for him with both barrels and chucked in a couple of hand grenades and a shoulder-launched missile for good measure.

Then the BBC’s Newsnight picked up the baton and handed it to Stella Creasy MP.

Stella and Newsnight’s Kirsty Wark were in the studio in London. Austin was in the BBC news room in Leeds perched on a stool in front of a monitor which showed him only a picture of himself or a newsfeed of events in Gaza. He remained there for 45 minutes. Austin is at the best of times fairly deaf, an advantage in politics but not on Newsnight.

He couldn’t see what was going on and he heard little. Stella had decided that the way to win was to interrupt Austin if he even opened his mouth. This she did very successfully.

It looked hilarious: two women talking urgently among themselves while a bewildered older man appeared above and between them in what seemed to be a glass box. He was looking puzzled and holding up his hands in a ‘don’t shoot me’ kind of way. When women finally do take over the world, I imagine scenes like this will be commonplace.

I’m still an enthusiastic supporter of AWS. But I am deeply disappointed that the women at the top of the Labour Party think it is perfectly OK to ‘diss’ an old and long-serving male MP just to demonstrate how tough they are.
