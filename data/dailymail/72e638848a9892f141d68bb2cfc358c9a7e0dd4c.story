Tragedy: Megan White, 11, died after suddenly collapsing at school last year

A healthy 11-year-old girl suddenly collapsed at school and died just 24 hours later after suffering a rare brain haemorrhage, an inquest heard.

Popular Megan White, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was 'merry and laughing' with her friends during the morning at All Saints’ Academy.

She had even told her mother not to pick her up from school that afternoon as she was having dinner at a friend's house.

But, just after lunch, she fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital where tests revealed she had suffered a small bleed on her brain.

Avon Coroners’ Court heard Megan then suffered a second, larger, bleed when she was in the accident and emergency ward, causing her to lose consciousness.

She underwent emergency surgery but did not recover from her brain injuries.

An inquest into Megan’s death at Flax Bourton in Somerset was told the haemorrhage was 'rare', with experts unable to pinpoint what had caused it.

Gail Elliman, deputy coroner for Avon, ruled Megan died from 'natural causes' following the tragedy in January last year.

She said: 'Megan collapsed at school on January 13. She was taken to hospital where investigations showed a large bleed on her brain.

'She was transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital where despite treatment, she died on January 14. I am sorry that the experts have not been able to make it any clearer as to why this happened.

'She died of natural causes.'

Dr Margrid Shindler, a consultant in paediatric intensive care at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, told the inquest: 'While she was in the emergency department, she had a larger bleed which caused her to go unconscious and at that point she was put on a breathing machine.

'She was taken to Frenchay Hospital and underwent neurosurgery. After that, unfortunately she was still showing signs of a very severe brain injury.

'This bleed occurred in an area very deep inside the brain where even a small bleed can cause a large amount of damage.

'We probably see two cases like this a year, where people come in with a small bleed then the second bleed occurs.

'Mostly, despite our best efforts, we are unable to save these children. It is very, very sad - going from someone who is quite normal to such devastating injury.'

'The family very kindly consented for organ donation and we thank them very much for their kind gift.'

Dr Craig Platt, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said he had consulted with other experts about what could have caused the haemorrhage.

Sudden: She arrived 'merry and laughing' friends at All Saint's School in Cheltenham in the morning but fell ill shortly after lunch

'It was clear that there had been quite a large haemorrhage which was the cause of death,' Dr Platt said.

'But I don’t think that we can say what the cause of this bleed was.'

The cause of death was recorded as cerebral haemorrhage and raised inter cranial pressure.

Speaking after Megan’s death in January last year, her parents Rebecca and Paul White, who attended the inquest, paid tribute to their daughter.

Mrs White said her daughter was 'always smiling' and 'generous beyond belief'.

'She’d been happier than usual on the morning of Friday the 13th when she died.

'Her teachers and friends said she was merry and laughing. Just after lunch she fell poorly immediately and the ambulance came.

'It was instant and quick and the surgeons said she wouldn’t have known anything.'

Mrs White added: 'Children seemed to gravitate to her.

'Megan was beautiful, but never vain - she always thought others were more beautiful.'

The schoolgirl had been particularly good at maths and loved performing as she 
was a 'bit of a drama queen'.

All
 Saints’ principal, Peter Kingham, said last year: 'Megan was a very popular 
student who loved being part of All Saints’ Academy. Megan was bright 
and cheerful and stood out as an excellent student.
