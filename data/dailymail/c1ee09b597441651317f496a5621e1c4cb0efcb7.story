QPR are ready to offer Karl Henry plus cash to Norwich in part-exchange for Holland midfielder Leroy Fer.

Norwich have already rejected a bid of around £4m for 24-year-old Fer and value him closer to £7m.

Henry, 31, joined QPR last year from Wolves but has been on the periphery of the first team.

Manager Harry Redknapp has confirmed an interest in Hamburg's Rafael van der Vaart but is keen to bring in a striker after seeing a £5m bid for Troy Deeney fall well short of Watford's £10m valuation.

Meanwhile, QPR midfielder Esteban Granero is close to joining Real Sociedad after talks over the weekend.

Sociedad are looking to pay around £3m for Granero after president Jokin Aperribay visited London at the weekend for talks.

Granero, 27, was on loan at Sociedad last season but tore an anterior cruciate in his right knee.

He will sign a four-year contract once the deal is completed and could be involved in the Europa League tie with Aberdeen.
