Radio station Triple M Melbourne has come under fire for its lack of diversity in its announcers.

The station tweeted '@TripleMMelb is back at #1' yesterday with a photo of its presenters after The Hot Breakfast was named most popular in the latest radio ratings.

At first, the picture which included Eddie McGuire, Mick Molloy and Luke Darcy seemed harmless - until Melbourne journalist Angela Pippos hit out at the picture, pointing out the lack of females at the station.

The tweet was fired off by Triple M Melbourne when its breakfast show was named most popular in ratings

'A gorgeous gathering but I can't quite put my finger on what's missing. #oestrogen,' she wrote, retweeting the photo.

Prominent media commentator and feminist Jane Caro has backed Pippos' comments and said the station wasn't catering for the biggest radio market.

'I am so grateful to Triple M for making it so clear that people like me (aka women) are not catered for on their station and I will therefore certainly never make the mistake of listening to them,' the Gruen Transfer wrote in an email to Daily Mail Australia.

'I would heartily encourage other people like me (aka women who still make 80% of purchases) and advertisers interested in talking to us to take similar action and avoid Triple M (aka Triple Men & no Women).'

Pippos' retweet has sparked a strong reaction from the online community.

'Dear Lord. That’s the bro-iest bro-fest I’ve ever seen,' @saskystewart said.

@steventalevski echoed her thoughts: 'Lack of diversity is a poor reflection of Melbourne.'

Journalist Angela Pippos wasn't the only one to notice, with Sasky Stewart tweeting 'That's the bro-iest bro-fest I've ever seen'

Steven Talevski tweeted: 'Lack of diversity is a poor reflection of Melbourne' in relation to the Triple M tweet

The photo starred all white males who are part of the Triple M team, including Collingwood president Eddie McGuire

Triple M Melbourne has since removed the photo from Twitter but it remains on its Facebook page

Since the lack of diversity was pointed out, Triple M Melbourne has removed the tweet but the offending picture still remains on Facebook where it has also taken a beating.

'This photo appears to have a filter on it that turns everyone into a white male,' Jarryd Strafford wrote. 

Some people have even asked why 'Rosie' - a female presenter at the station - did not appear in the picture.

'Rosie not good enough to get her mug in the pic ed?' Michael Drew wrote.

According to the Triple M website, Rosie is on air during the breakfast slot when its three male hosts are on holidays.

'You'll know Rosie's laugh from The Hot Breakfast as she controls the studio that keeps Eddie McGuire, Luke Darcy and Mick Molloy on the air,' it read.

MailOnline has contacted Triple M Melbourne for comment on this matter.

People on Facebook were asking why one of the station's presenters by the name of Rosie was not part of the photo
