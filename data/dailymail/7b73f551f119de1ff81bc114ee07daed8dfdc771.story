Breathing secondhand marijuana smoke could damage the heart and blood vessels as much as secondhand cigarette smoke. 

In a new study, blood vessel function in lab rats dropped 70 percent after just 30 minutes of exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke.

Even when the marijuana contained no THC - the compound that causes the 'high' - blood vessel function was still impaired.

'Most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad, but many don't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful,' the new study warns

Blood vessel function is important because a reduced level may raise the chances of developing hardened arteries.

If function is low, plaque can build-up in the arteries which narrows them and restricts blood flow. This, in turn, can increase the risk of a heart attack.

'Most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad for you, but many don't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful,' said study author Matthew Springer, associate professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco's Cardiology Division.

Marijuana and tobacco smoke are chemically and physically alike, aside from their active ingredients.

The drop in blood vessel function from THC-free marijuana suggests that the compound isn't responsible for the effect. 

Similarly, this study confirms that nicotine is not required for smoke to interfere with blood vessel function.

In the study, researchers used a modified cigarette smoking machine to expose rats to marijuana smoke. 

A high-resolution ultrasound machine measured how well the main leg artery functioned. 

Researchers recorded blood vessel dilation before smoke exposure and 10 minutes and 40 minutes after smoke exposure.

Exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke hardened the arteries (pictured) over time, in turn increasing the risk of a heart attack 

They also conducted separate tests with THC-free marijuana and plain air. There was no difference in blood vessel function when the rats were exposed to plain air.

In previous tobacco studies, blood vessel function tended to go back to normal within 30 minutes of exposure. 

However, in the marijuana study, blood vessel function didn't return to normal when measured 40 minutes after exposure.

Now that marijuana is becoming increasingly legalised in the United States, its effect on others is a growing public health concern, Dr Springer said.

'If you're hanging out in a room where people are smoking a lot of marijuana, you may be harming your blood vessels,' he said. 

'There's no reason to think marijuana smoke is better than tobacco smoke. Avoid them both.'

Secondhand tobacco smoke causes about 34,000 premature deaths from heart disease each year in the United States among nonsmokers. 

More research is needed to determine if secondhand marijuana smoke has other similar effects to secondhand cigarette smoke in humans.

The research was presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2014.
