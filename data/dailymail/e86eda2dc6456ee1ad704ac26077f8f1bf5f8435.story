Mother-of-three Sarah Mallon, 38, stole £7,000 from her grandparents' savings and spent it on Xbox games, takeaway pizza and a holiday

A Ministry of Defence security guard stole £7,000 from her grandparents' savings and spent it on Xbox games, takeaway pizza and a holiday.

Mother-of-three Sarah Mallon, 38, funded her gaming habit with her grandparents' money after they gave her access to their bank account so she could run errands.

She was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years, after admitting fraud by false representation at Portsmouth Crown Court.

Mallon's grandparents, Margaret and Peter Cantrill, had brought her up as their own child in Clanfield near Waterlooville, Hampshire.

But she ran into financial difficulty after splitting up with her partner and became homeless for four months.

She started taking their cash and even accepted a £600 loan from them so she could buy a car.

The security guard spent £7,000 over 100 separate transactions online at websites like bookmaker Ladbrokes and retail giant Amazon between August 2012 and October 2013.

Her solicitor, Anne Brown, said Mallon had taken to online gambling in the hope of winning the money back and that she was horrified when she found out the total. 

Banking records revealed she spent as little as 15 pounds on takeaway pizzas but she also funded a holiday with their money, the court heard.

The thefts only to came to light when grandfather Peter died, aged 89, prompting other family members to look at the bank account.

Tammy Mears, prosecuting, said: 'The money was spent on things they had not even heard of. Mrs Cantrill said she does not even know what an Xbox is.'

Recorder Andrew Maitland said: 'There are few offences more abhorrent in these courts than where a member of a family has abused the trust and love given from an ageing relative.

'The one thing that convinces me against custody is the product of your offending had the ability of breaking up your family with catastrophic results.

'You have put at risk, through your actions repeatedly over an extended period of time, the whole family that in the past you have struggled to keep together.'

Mallon's grandparents, both in their 80s, were living on teachers' pensions.

Mr Cantrill also had two pensions from his time serving in the army and the Royal Navy when the thefts took place.

The transactions pushed them into their overdraft, something that had never previously happened.
