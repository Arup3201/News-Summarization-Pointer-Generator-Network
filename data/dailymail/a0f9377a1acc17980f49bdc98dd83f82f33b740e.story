Many men shy away from the yoga studio, dismissing it as 'too feminine and spiritual'.

But a new, 'manlier' form of the exercise loved by Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has just launched to help British men tone up by practising it alongside their regular fitness regimes.

'Yoga is not just for girls,'  its creator Matt Miller, a college American football star turned bodybuilder and nutrition expert, tells Men's Fitness magazine. 'Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme.'

Broga creator Matt Miller says broga works for every athlete and helps incorporate stretching into their fitness regimes

Miller learned that the hard way, dealing with injuries from years of running, colliding and lifting that left him with what he calls a 'severely limited' range of motion. 

He discovered yoga after signing on as an ambassador with clothing brand Lululemon - and soon started to wonder why he'd never done it before.

Combining his studies with his own personal training experience, he created broga, a style designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability. 

It's now being taught at locations around southeast England, with more trainers and locations being created on a near-monthly basis.

And no, it isn't only for men. 'We get quite a few ladies at the classes,' says Miller.

'Most of them are looking for a no-nonsense style that will build strength alongside flexibility.'

And that's where this plan comes in. It's designed to work alone, but can also be incorporated into your regular regime - after all, flexibility is everything - and can be done up to four days a week.

Progress at your own level, and resist the urge to go for the hardest possible version of each move on the first go. This is about preventing injuries, not chasing them.

Side triangle: Start in a lunge with your back foot at a 45 degree angle and all the weight on your front foot, with your front knee directly over your front foot - this is great for your back

After the strength portion of each workout, you'll move on to stretches that open up the areas you've just worked. Don't skip them. 'Try to progress further each time,' advises Miller. 

'You'll learn to establish connections that open up typically tight areas like the chest, hips, and hamstrings.' 

Most importantly, give it time to work.

Broga isn't designed as a quick fix - you've spent years (or possibly decades) creating imbalances in your body, so expecting to fix them with a week's worth of downward dog is optimistic at best. 

Stick with the plan for a month and you should find you're more flexible than ever - and more than equipped to try your hand at a class if you want to. And no, you still don't need to buy any patchouli oil.

Personal trainer Jack Braniff added: 'Broga helps with your mobility, flexibility, strength, core, balance and also an increased blood flow to your muscles, all which can help with weight loss. 

'Increased mobility, in particularly hip and shoulder will see a marked improvement in your big lifts, full ROM (range of motion) squats, deadlifts, overhead press etc and especially the Olympic lifts. All tools to get massive. 

'Likewise, certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training.

'Pro cycling teams for instance, use sun salutations before their rides, something I also use before my sessions.

'Although the breathing and chanting does have it's place to help calm, you take what you want from yoga, and in my case it's a more structured way to improve my mobility and help with my other gym activities, not to meditate.' 

 MATT MILLER'S TOP BROGA MOVES (the first two in each section are the exercises and numbers three and four are the stretches) Enjoy!

BACK 

1. One-leg updog/split  

One-leg updog: Start in the bottom of a press-up and straighten your arms. Raise your chest and lift one leg off the floor

Start in the bottom of a press-up and straighten your arms. Raise your chest and lift one leg off the floor. That's the updog. 

Push your shoulders back and lift the raised leg high, then drop back into the updog. Do five reps, then repeat on the other side.

2. Side triangle

Start in a lunge with your back foot at a 45˚ angle and all the weight on your front foot, with your front knee directly over your front foot. Reach up, then straighten that bent front knee. 

Bend and straighten again five times, then repeat on the other side. 

Pelvic press/fold: Raise your hands, drawing your shoulders down and squeezing your glutes. Then press your pelvis forward for five breaths, relaxing your arms more every time you exhale

3. Pelvic press/fold

Raise your hands, drawing your shoulders down and squeezing your glutes. Then press your pelvis forward for five breaths, relaxing your arms more every time you exhale. Then exhale and dive forward into a pelvic fold. Stay there for five breaths. 

Pigeon stretch: Fold one leg out in front of you with the other behind you. Try to press the hip of your rearleg into the ground. This move is great for your legs

4. Seated twist  

Squeeze your quads and sit back as if in a chair as low as you can without your knees going in front of your toes. Put one fist in the other palm and twist to that side. 

Take five breaths, aiming to keep your elbow pointing straight up. Repeat on the other side.

LEGS 

1 Warrior lunge

Start in a lunge and make sure your hips are facing forward and your front knee is directly over your front foot. Raise your arms and pull your shoulders down. 

Drop down until your back knee is 2-3cm off the ground. Then go back to the start position. Do five reps and then repeat on the other side.

2 Sumo squat/horse stance

Start in a sumo squat with your thighs and feet at 45˚ to your torso and your glutes no lower than knee height. Go fist-to-palm with your shoulders back, chest raised and head neutral. Hold for one breath. 

Release your hips so your fingertips touch the floor. Hold for one breath. Return to the sumo squat. Aim for ten reps. 

4 Pigeon stretch

Fold one leg out in front of you with the other behind you. Try to press the hip of your rear leg into the ground. Roll your shoulders back and raise your chest. Make your shoulders and hips face forward and try to stay here for five breaths. Repeat on the other side.

3 Wide angle stretch

This will stretch your hamstrings and adductors. The rule is: you can't bend your knees. Stand with hands on the ground and feet wide apart and squeeze your quads. 

Walk your hands forwards and feel the stretch. Stay here for five breaths, walking your hands back towards your body a little with each breath.

CHEST 

1 Broga press-up

Get into a press-up position with your elbows tucked in and shoulders pushed back away from the neck. Tuck your pelvis under so you're using your abs muscles, not your lower back. 

Lower yourself halfway to the floor, keeping your elbows close to your body. Aim for ten reps.

2 Dirty dog

Start in downward dog: hands and feet on the floor, pelvis up, looking at your feet. Lift one leg, creating a straight line from heel to shoulders to hands. 

Bring your head between your hands, then push back through your shoulders to go back into that one-legged split. Do five on each side. 

Broga press-up: Get into a press-up position with your elbows tucked in and shoulders pushed back away from the neck to help boost your chest muscles 

3 One-arm-to-full camel

Start on your knees with toes tucked, then place one palm on your heel. Lift your pelvis and drop your shoulder. Look up at the opposite hand as you stretch it up and back. 

Hold for five breaths and repeat on the other side. If you can, plant both hands on your heels for the full camel.

4 Side plank to rockstar

Assume a side plank position with your hand directly under your shoulder. Stack one foot on top of the other and make your body as long as possible. Pull your shoulders away from your neck. That's your setup. 

Place the foot of your top leg on the floor behind you and feel the stretch for five breaths. Repeat on the other side.

SHOULDERS 

1 Dolphin

Start in a forearm plank with your abs tensed. Bring your chin ahead of your fists, then exhale and raise your bottom, keeping your legs straight. Bring your shoulders back behind your elbows. Complete ten reps.

2 90/180 handstand

Stand 30cm from a wall with your back to it. Bend forward, put your hands on the floor, then walk your feet up the wall until your body is at a 90˚ angle. 

Press your heels into the wall as hard as you can, then raise one leg straight up, then lower it. Alternate legs for as many reps as you can.
