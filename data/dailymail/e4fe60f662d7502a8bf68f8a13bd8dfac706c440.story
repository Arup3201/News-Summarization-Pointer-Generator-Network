Gunmen who shot a middle-aged mother and her son in a terrifying targeted attack outside a bingo hall were being hunted by police today.

Scott Calder, 22, and his 56-year-old mother Marie were caught in a hail of bullets after they were ambushed in a car park outside the Gala Bingo branch.

Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder, who uses the nickname 'The Demon' on his Facebook page, was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire.

Scene: Police search the car park outside the Gala Bingo in Harpurhey, Manchester, where 22-year-old Scott Calder and his 56-year-old mother Marie were shot

Target: Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire

Detectives were also believed to be investigating reports of a dispute between Mr Calder and other members of the family.

Ms Calder and her son were attacked shortly after Mr Calder arrived at the car park outside the bingo hall to pick her up at around 7.15pm last night.

Moments later, a black car pulled up behind the family, blocking them in the car park outside the Harpurhey branch of chain Gala Bingo in Manchester.

Probe: A police cordon remained around the scene today as officers continued to investigate the shooting

Two men then climbed out of the car and fired a number of shots at the Mr Calder's Audi.

One bullet hit Ms Calder in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack.

Mr Calder managed to get out of the car park and abandoned his car in a nearby street before he and his injured mother staggered to hospital.

The nearest hospital, North Manchester General, is about a half-hour walk away.

Doctors then called police to investigate the shooting. Neither injury was believed to be life-threatening.

The incident occurred in the gritty Manchester district of Harpurhey where controversial BBC Three reality TV show People Like Us was based - and which was critically panned for showing a stereotypical view of the locals.

Just minutes before the shooting Mr 
Calder posted a message on his Facebook page saying: 'Stab me in the 
back, I'll blast ur spine.'

Another posted on January 5 said: 'n this game there's only one don' and on Jan 9 he wrote: 'Even if I died young who cares.'

Today the injured man posted a series of messages about the shooting - the first saying: 'In hospital bin shot.'

He
 sent another message later saying: 'Bin woke up for operation to get da
 bullet out ma hand. Goin for ma operation, nuff love to everyone.'

His
 sister Jessica left a message saying: 'My mum's a soldier so is my 
brother. Hope my mums [sic] ok i love u loads x x x x strongest women in the 
worldx.'

One local said: "It
 is shocking and terrifying to think this happened outside a bingo hall.
 Scott is very well known in the locality and it's terrible to think his
 mum has been shot after being unwittingly caught up in some kind of 
dispute.'

Wellwishers went 
onto Calder's Facebook page to pass on goodwill messages. Chantelle 
Livesey said: 'Hope everything ok scott and your poor mum x.' Levi 
Mcdade said: 'Hope everything is okay and Same to your mum x.'

Ambush: One bullet hit the mother in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack, which took place at around 7.15pm

The scene of the shooting, at the rear of Asda in front of Harpurhay Market was cordoned off by police tape and several officers were seen patrolling the area. Seven cars remain in the cordoned-off car park.

Detective Superintendent Alex Millet said: 'This appears to be a targeted incident which could have had even more dire consequences.

'Thankfully it doesn’t look like either are too seriously injured, but we’ll know more tomorrow.

Well-wishers: Scott Calder told his friends via Facebook that he had been shot, prompting messages of support

Operation: Mr Calder told his friends he had received surgery for the bullet wound to his wrist

'We believe the black car was driven by two white men and it’s from that car that the shots were fired.

'I want to reassure people that we have had armed response officers to the scene and are now investigating.'

A spokesman from Greater Manchester Police said he could not disclose why the pair might have been targeted.
