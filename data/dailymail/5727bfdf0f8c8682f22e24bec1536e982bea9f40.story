FOOTBALL THAT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD

If proof were needed that football really is a universal sport, then it came in the form of news from space. Three astronauts - two Americans and one German - aboard the International Space Station have sent videos of them playing football before settling down to watch the Brazil v Croatia game on TV.

FIFA have cleared the confusion over ‘cooling breaks’. We were expecting to see them during each game but they will be considered on a match-by-match basis. They will also be limited to three minutes, the time being added on at the end of each half.

The Brazilian ambassador opened up his London embassy for a World Cup party, but stopped short of promising a similar bash should his country make the final.

German club Union Berlin have come up with an ingenious way to attract fans to their stadium to watch the World Cup on a big screen. The club have positioned 750 sofas across the pitch for viewers to sit on. They are even providing covers in case it rains.

BEST BET BRIAN

England and Italy are expected to struggle in hot and humid Manaus. Some poor wee souls won’t last the 90 minutes and it’s 3/1 that any substitute scores.

CUT-PRICE CHRIS

Don’t believe the miserable so-and-sos backing a 0-0 draw in Manaus. England will nick a half-timelead but wilt in the heat as Italy earn a 1-1 draw in the second half at 18-1.
