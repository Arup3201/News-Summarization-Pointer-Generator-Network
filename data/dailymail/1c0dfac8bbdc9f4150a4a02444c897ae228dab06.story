The taxpayer paid £10,000 for a 20-foot snake called Albert to be restuffed by the Foreign Office.

Despite insisting deep public spending cuts were ‘essential to the future of the country’, William Hague signed off on the extraordinary bill for the restoration of the 120-year-old anaconda.

The reptile hangs in the library of the Foreign Office, but was found to be in ‘poor condition’  so a refurbishment was ordered.

The Foreign Office insisted Albert the snake is a 'unique historical heirloom deserving of essential maintenance'

A team from the Natural History Museum spent five weeks on the work, using an expensive X-ray CT scanning machine.

The Foreign Office, which is cutting its budget by a quarter over four years, defended the work, saying the snake had not been restuffed for up to 50 years.

The snake is thought to have been presented by a Bishop, in what is now Guyana, to the Colonial Secretary in the 19th century.

According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), exact names and dates are unknown but Albert was pictured in Whitehall building in 1892.

Tonight Mr Hague was unavailable to 
defend the £10,000 bill personally. Officials said he was hosting 
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on a state visit.

But a FCO spokesman tried to justify defended the cost, admitting it was 'quite a bit of money but he is a very big snake'.

He
 added: 'We will not be constricted nor will we scale back in our 
dedicated to preserving this historic national treasure. This will 
preserve him for posterity.

Foreign Secretary William Hague signed off the restuffing of the snake, which he complained was the only thing left in the Foreign Office library after being run down by Labour

'Albert is a unique historic heirloom deserving essential maintenance to an appropriate standard after decades of neglect.'

Responding to a Freedom of Information request by the Guido Fawkes website, the ministry added: ‘As a gift to the FCO, Albert is therefore regarded as an FCO asset. As such, the FCO is obliged to maintain its assets, and the work on Albert was essential maintenance.

‘It is believed that Albert was first re-stuffed in the 1960s or 1970s, but there are no records of how much it cost on that occasion. Certainly no significant maintenance has been carried out on him in the last 40-50 years.

‘Albert was never housed in a glass case, as is commonly believed. In moving him from his suspended position in the Ansell Library (a separate Library area to the old Home Office Library referenced above) to facilitate planned refurbishment to the area it was observed he was in poor condition.

‘A decision was taken to use this opportunity to carry out a refurbishment to ‘Albert’ including a safety check on the suspension fittings. The cost of the conservation and restoration work on ‘Albert’ was £10,000.

‘The level of detailed, delicate work in the restoration involved an intensive amount of care and attention from highly trained staff.’

In a speech last year Mr Hague criticised his Labour predecessors for stripping the Foreign Office library of its 6,000 books.

He said: ‘It is ironic that the only object to survive the gutting of the library is a one hundred year old twenty-foot stuffed anaconda known as Albert, who remains suspended over the empty bookshelves, while the books from the period when such an unusual foreign gift found its way into the Foreign Office have been dismantled around it, and can never be reassembled.

Officials said Albert had been photographed in the Foreign Office on Whitehall 120 years ago

‘To my mind the fate of the FCO library is emblematic of a gradual hollowing out of the qualities that made the FCO one of our great institutions.’

In May 2011 Lord Jay of Ewelme, the former head of the diplomatic service, demanded to know what had become of Albert.

Tory Foreign Office minister Lord Howell of Guildford, who is George Osborne’s father-in-law, told the peer:

‘Albert, the 20-foot long stuffed anaconda, has graced the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) library for over a century. He remains proudly in place, just as he did throughout the noble Lord's distinguished career in the FCO, and continues to be held in great affection by FCO staff.

‘We have no plans for Albert other than to clean and stuff him from time to time.’ At some considerable cost, it turns out.

The Foreign Office is one of the grandest buildings in Whitehall. Durbar Court is a glass roofed courtyard, originally occupied by the British Indian Office which is now part of William Hague's ministry

Foreign Secretary William Hague he bill for refurbishing Albert the snake was revealed in a Freedom of Information request to the Guido Fawkes website. It stated:

‘Albert’ the anaconda was allegedly presented by a Bishop, in what is now Guyana, to the Colonial Secretary in the 19th century – exact names and dates are unknown.

However, he appears in a photo from circa 1892, which means he has been in the FCO for at least 120 years.

As a gift to the FCO, Albert is therefore regarded as an FCO asset. As such, the FCO is obliged to maintain its assets, and the work on ‘Albert’ was essential maintenance.

It is believed that ‘Albert’ was first re-stuffed in the 1960s or 1970s, but there are no records of how much it cost on that occasion.

Certainly no significant maintenance has been carried out on him in the last 40-50 years. ‘Albert’ was never housed in a glass case, as is commonly believed.

In moving him from his suspended position in the Ansell Library (a separate Library area to the old Home Office Library referenced above) to facilitate planned refurbishment to the area it was observed he was in poor condition.

A decision was taken to use this opportunity to carry out a refurbishment to ‘Albert’ including a safety check on the suspension fittings.

The cost of the conservation and restoration work on ‘Albert’ was £10,000.

The work was undertaken by the Conservation Team at the Natural History Museum, over a 5-week period, from 21 May to 26 June 2012.

As nothing was known about previous work done on ‘Albert’, the conversation team at the NHM needed to use x-ray CT scanning, which is a costly procedure that required extensive data processing and a specialist to do the analysis.

Also, the level of detailed, delicate work in the restoration involved an intensive amount of care and attention from highly trained staff.
