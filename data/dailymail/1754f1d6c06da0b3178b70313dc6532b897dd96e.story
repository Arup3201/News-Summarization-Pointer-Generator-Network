Â A senior Egyptian government official has survived an assassination attempt after a bomb targeted his convoy in Cairo today.

Interior minister Mohammed Ibrahim was travelling to the ministry when his black SUV was hit by the 'large explosive device' in the capital's Nasr City district.

Nasr City is a stronghold of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group, but it is not known who is responsible for the attack.

Survivor: Egypt's interior minister Mohammed Ibrahim was the target of today's attack

Mr Ibrahim, who escaped the explosion 
unscathed, spoke on state television two hours after the attack.

He said at least eight people - including two policemen and a child - had been seriously injured in the blast, which 
happened at 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT).

He also said four vehicles among his convoy had been damaged, as well as a number of civilian-owned cars.

'It was a heinous (assassination) attempt,' he later told reporters at the Interior Ministry in central Cairo.

He added that the explosion, which happened near his home in Mustafa 
al-Nahas street, had likely been detonated by remote control.

There are conflicting reports over the source of the explosion, which was so powerful it 
shattered the windows of nearby shops and apartments, severed the 
branches of surrounding trees and sparked a fire. Police are still searching for suspects in the area.

People gather at the site of the explosion. It was the first attack on a senior government official since a coup toppled the country's Islamist president Mohamed Morsi two months ago

The assassination attempt is the first 
attack on a senior government official since a coup toppled the 
country's Islamist president Mohamed Morsi two months ago.

It harks back to the insurgency waged 
by Islamists in the 1980s and 1990s against the rule of now-ousted 
autocrat Hosni Mubarak - with senior government officials, including the
speaker of parliament and the interior minister, targeted by assassins.

Mubarak himself survived an assassination attempt in 1994, when militants attacked his convoy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
