A father told how he feared that his 'hero' son wanted to kill him and his wife the day before the couple were shot dead at their home, a court heard today.

Pensioner Bob Seddon, 68, began to suspect that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son Stephen, 46, to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65.

He had planned to confront his son with his fears on the afternoon before the couple were killed but the meeting never took place, Manchester Crown Court was told.

Bob and Patricia Seddon were been found dead in what was at first a suspected murder-suicide. Their son, Stephen, 46, right, is on trial over their deaths

The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son 
to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65

Tragic: The couple's bodies were discovered after a neighbour raised the alarm and police broke into their house in Manchester

He confided his fears to his doctor 
only the day before the couple were gunned down with a sawn-off shot gun
at their semi detached home in Sale, Greater Manchester in July last 
year.

The jury at Manchester Crown Court has
been told that Stephen Seddon was hailed a hero for trying to rescue 
his parents from the wreckage of a hired BMW which he had driven into a 
canal in March.

Seddon claimed the crash into the 
Bridgewater canal in Timperley was an accident and was portrayed as the 'saviour' of the elderly couple in newspaper and television reports.

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC claimed 
that Seddon - known to his parents as Nic - plotted their murder to get 
his hands on his £230,000 inheritance as the sole beneficiary of their 
joint wills.

Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital

Suffering: The couple narrowly escaped tragedy in March after their car plunged into Bridgewater Canal

Hard times: The couple had both suffered health issues and lost their daughter three years ago

He told the jury: 'The day 
before the murders Mr Seddon had an appointment with his GP. He 
expressed the view that the canal incident was not an accident.

'He expressed his concern that it was 
his belief that his son had tried to kill him and his wife when he had 
driven the car into the canal.

'He gave a number of reasons for this
belief. He was due to see his son later that day and he was intending 
to confront him about it but no meeting appear to have taken place.'

Mr Wright said that Seddon had taken 
his wife and two of their children to a caravan park in Fleetwood, 
Lancashire, at the time of the murders but had driven back to their home
in Seaham, County Durham.

He made a call to someone who has 
convictions for firearms offences and then borrowed his brother in law's
car which he drove to Sale.

The car was tracked by roadside cameras travelling from Seaham to the Sale area and then back again to the North East.

Mr Wright said there was a 21 minute 
window between the car arriving in the Sale area and then being picked 
up by camera leaving in the opposite direction.

He said the bodies of the couple were 
found two days later after neighbours raised concerns with the police 
who broke into the house.

Mr Wright said that scene had been 
made to look like a murder-suicide with the gun being placed upon Mr 
Seddon's lap with his right hand on the weapon.

Investigation: Prosecutors said the scene had been 
made to look like a murder-suicide

But forensic and ballistics reports 
were 'entirely inconsistent' with the proposition and it would have 
been impossible for Mr Seddon to have shot himself from the position in 
which he was found, he said.

Seddon was arrested but made only 'selective' answers to questions. He said it was 'ridiculous' to 
claim the canal crash was a murder bid.

'He claimed that someone was trying to set him up and that the police were blinkered,' said Mr Wright.

Mr Wright added: 'The evidence 
presents a compelling picture which demonstrates overwhelmingly the 
single conclusion that Stephen Seddon determined his parents needed to 
die.

'Having decided they must do so, he 
embarked upon a course of actions which led to their murders and 
eventually this court room.'

The trial continues.
