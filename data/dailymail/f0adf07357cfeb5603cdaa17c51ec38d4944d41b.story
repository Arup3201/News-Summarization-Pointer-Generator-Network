She is the new darling of the velodrome.

But few who watched 20-year-old Laura Trott race to gold for the second time in three days will realise how her very presence on the Olympic track is a minor miracle in itself.

The blonde 5ft 4in cyclist from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire is lucky to be alive after she was born a month prematurely suffering from a collapsed lung, leading to six weeks in intensive care.

This led her to suffer from severe asthma as a young girl for which doctors advised her to start swimming to strengthen her body.

She was eight when she swapped swimming for cycling, becoming  European champion in 2010.

She overcame her asthma but is still often sick after races, a result of a separate acid lining problem that also dates to her childhood.

‘I’ve been throwing up since I was 10,’ she said. ‘As soon as I stop I can’t control it for long. The worst was at the [2010] Commonwealth Games. It was on telly, wasn’t it? Me being sick in a bucket.’

Her stunning victory in the women’s omnium yesterday in the frenzied atmosphere of the velodrome follows the gold she won in the women’s team pursuit at the weekend, alongside team-mates Joanna Roswell and Dani King.

Expressing her delight at winning two gold medals in three days, she said: ‘I know it’s pretty mad – I may as well retire. How am I ever going to top that.’

After winning gold, Laura Trott pedalled straight to where her friends and family were seated and threw herself into the crowd for a warm embrace

‘It is just amazing, I can’t believe I have done it to be honest.’

Trott had been in second place, behind American Sarah Hammer, going into the final race of the six-discipline omnium, and faced the task of having to win the time trial and finish three places ahead of her rival.

Roared on by a wave of noise from home supporters, Trott won in spectacular style, finishing on 18 points – one better than Hammer.

Describing the last 500m of the race, she said: ‘I was nervous but confident. My legs were killing but the crowd just drove me home and I thought ‘I’m not giving up now’.

Yesterday her family, accountant 
father Adrian and teaching assistant mother Glenda, were among 6,000 
spectators in the velodrome, as well as older sister Emma, 22, also a 
professional cyclist, who competed alongside Trott at the Delhi 
Commonwealth Games.

In an emotional tribute to her family, Trott said: ‘I couldn’t have done it without them.

'The amount of money they had to put in to take me here and there and everywhere.

'My dad had to give up his cricket, so yeah. I can’t thank everyone enough really.’

Trott also revealed she would like to retire at 28 so she can start a family.

‘I want to be a young mum,’ she said.

Eight
 years ago Trott met her idol Bradley Wiggins and he let her pose for a 
photo with his Athens Olympic gold medal around her neck.

Tonight she has two of her own.

Described by British Cycling 
performance director Dave Brailsford as 'a bundle of energy with a 
contagious enthusiasm', Trott began cycling aged eight when her mother 
took up the sport to lose weight.

The
 former Turnford School pupil has never looked back, with regular bike 
rides down the Lea Valley on a Saturday morning and visits to Welwyn 
track eventually leading to her progression through British Cycling 
programmes alongside her sister Emma.

After discovering she'd done enough 
to win gold last night, the tearful Trott pedalled over to screaming family, 
friends and teammates in the front row of the velodrome - before 
embarking on a lap of honour draped in a union flag.

Going into the final day of competition, Trott held the joint lead, buts he slipped to second behind Hammer after coming second in the individual pursuit, and third in the 10km scratch.

It meant she went into the
 final event, the 500m time trial, two points behind the American - 
needing to finish three clear places ahead of her.

It seemed an unachievable goal, but 
watched in the velodrome by a 6,000-strong crowd including The Princess 
Royal, Prince Harry, princesses Beatrice, Eugenie and NBA star Kobe 
Bryant, Trott raced around her two laps at blistering pace, finishing 
well ahead of Hammer and registering the margin she needed for victory.
