A devoted father-of-three and beloved husband tragically fell to his death during a cycling race.

Robert Verhaaren was participating in the annual LoToJa competition and swerved to avoid a pothole on a
bridge over the Snake River in Wyoming, when he crashed and fell 35 feet on Saturday afternoon -- just eight miles from the finish line.

The 42-year-old, who works at a private equity firm in Mesa,
Arizona, was being remembered as an 'awesome' family man by friends.

'It was devastating for us to lose a 
member of our LoToJa family,' race spokesman Dave Bern told The Associated Press. 
'Unfortunately, these things go along with bicycle racing. Cycling is 
not for the risk averse.'

Sheriff's
deputies said when Verhaaren swerved to miss the pothole, he crashed 
into a guardrail and was catapulted over it into the river.

The victim was a highly experienced cyclist who had competed in the event at least twice before, organizers said.

Bern
said it was the first major accident on the bridge in the race's 
history, and organizers would discuss it with Wyoming Department of 
Transportation officials.

Verhaaren is survived by his wife Bridget, and three young children; Ansel, Helena and Karl, according to theÂ Cache Valley Daily.

He
and his wife were cyclist enthusiasts, as is his sister-in-law, Olympic BMX 
cyclist Arielle Martin, who is married to his brother Michael.

Bern said the 206-mile race, that starts in Logan, Utah, and ends in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, also was marred by serious 
accidents in Idaho and Wyoming that sent two bicyclists to the hospital 
and by flat tires experienced by roughly 200 cyclists early on.

He says it's the first fatality in the race's 30-year history, that is billed as the longest one-day bicycle race in the country sanctioned by USA Cycling.

Verhaaren was a graduate of Brigham Young University and received his law degree from New York University School of Law.

His most recent position was as Managing Director of the Universal Equity Group Funds Arizona.

In addition to his successful career in finance, Verhaaren was a committed Boy Scouts troop leader.

'His whole family is awesome,' the Verhaaren's neighbor, Jay Larson, said. 'They would bend over backwards for anyone.'

The family man would have celebrated his 43rd birthday next week.

Race: It is the first fatality in the 30-year history of the race, which is billed as the longest one-day bicycle race in the U.S.

The tragedy sent shock waves through the race community, which attracted 1,500 competitors from across the nation.

'After every race, we discuss what worked and what didn't, what do we need to change and what do we need to improve,' Bern said. 'We had less crashes this year than usual, but the ones we had were more serious.'

Another cyclist was seriously injured in a crash on the descent from Strawberry Summit in southeastern Idaho, while another was severely injured in a crash near Wyoming's Alpine Junction about 45 miles from the finish line.

Less than 20 miles into the race, cyclists began experiencing an unusually high number of flat tires. They were blamed on thorny weeds by some cyclists and on very small nails by others.

Riders also had to deal with horses on the road and smoke from a Wyoming wildfire during the race.

'It was strange stuff going on, stuff I don't normally see (at LoToJa),' Bern said.
