An Australian businessman, who was charged with horrific child abuse in the Philippines, reportedly fled a string of  fraud and sold his young bride as a prostitute.

Peter Gerard Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme, The Age reports.

Scully was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria.

When the 52-year-old returned to Australia, he was accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim.

The allegations followed as the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon.

Scully was charged on Friday and he could now face the death penalty in the Philippines after being accused of killing a child and orchestrating an international paedophile ring.

The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. 

An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully.

'Does it surprise me?' the associate said.

'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.'

A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme.

Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. 

It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. 

It's alleged Scully, from the Melbourne suburb of Burwood, had  took part in perverted acts against children as young as one, which he filmed.

The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death.

'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Sherwin Gatchalian, an MP with the Nationalist People's Coalition, said.

Filipinos across the country took to social media to call for his execution. 

Scully managed to avoid being arrested until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013.

It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully.

An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home.

Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 

Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house.

Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.   

The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.
