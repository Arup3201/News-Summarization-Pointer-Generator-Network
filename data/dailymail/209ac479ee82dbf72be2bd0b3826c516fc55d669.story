For Carl Froch next, it’s Las Vegas or bust.

Only the lure of a grandstand farewell performance in the star-spangled fight capital of the world is likely to dissuade the conqueror of Wembley from bowing out after ‘the greatest night of my boxing life'.

At coming up 37 and having finished his aggravated business with George Grove in the most conclusive manner possible - with one of the most spectacular knock-out punches in the annals of the prize-ring – he needs an irresistible reason to go back to the well of world championship punishment yet again.

Looking ahead: Carl Froch, snapped by our man Graham Chadwick in the aftermath of his stunning victory over George Groves at Wembley, would like to end his glittering career in Las Vegas

Party time: Froch celebrates his victory over Groves in their rematch as he retained his two world titles

Julio 
Cesar Chavez Jnr – colourful namesake son of the Mexican legend – on 
that Strip of temptation to the rich tune of pay-per-view in America as 
well as Britain could provide the incentive.

Or maybe a rematch with Andre Ward, the only super-middleweight in the world Froch has not defeated.

‘How is Eddie Hearn going to pull off anything to top what I’ve just done?’, Froch asked of his Matchroom promoter after he had illuminated an historic Saturday night at Wembley Stadium by exacting retribution against George Groves in a manner which not only sent his young challenger into a coma but stunned a record 80,000 crowd.

Froch provided the answer himself: ‘It has always been a dream of mine to fight in Las Vegas. That box remains to be ticked. I will enjoy the summer with my family before I even think about what to do after this incredible night.

‘This could be the perfect way to hang up the gloves. But a signature fight in the MGM Grand Garden...’

The more he thought about it the more appealing that notion became: ‘After all, I feel 36 years young.’

Another bristling young Englishman, former Olympic gold medallist James DeGale, reinforced his claim as No 1 contender for Froch’s IBF belt with an impressive victory of his own, over American Brandon Gonzalez.

But the silencing of another noisy neighbour like Groves is low on Froch’s priorities and Gale expects he will have to wait for his moment.

Not least because after two successive mandatory fights against Groves, Froch is now entitled to at least one voluntary defence of his IBF and WBA titles.

So while it might be convenient again for Hearn to bring together two of his stable of fighters, he concedes: ‘I have to find something to put before Carl which floats his boat. Otherwise who knows if he will box again?’

Still, even as he took his late-night leave of the fabulous scene of his concussive glory, the Nevada seed was beginning to take root in his warrior mind.

Froch recalled how a low-key first trip to Vegas filled him with the ambition to return there as a show-topping champion.

Taking a trip: Groves entered the cavernous Wembley stadium on a red double decker bus

He travelled  to watch Prince Naseem Hamed take on Marco Antonio Barrera there 13 years ago, taking his partner Rachael with him.

‘Back then we didn’t have much money,’ he said. ‘We couldn’t afford the MGM so we stayed down at Circus-Circus.

‘We’d saved up to go so arrived skint. I knew nothing about gambling but couldn’t resist trying. I threw our last few dollars cash on the craps table and lost.

‘So I thought I  could get it back by putting the biggest bet I could extract from the ATM machine on Naz to win.  Just our luck, he lost his world title.

‘But now I had the dream of going back there with my name up in lights.’

Hearn will try to make that happen, preferably against Chavez. Not because Froch lost to Ward but because, as he puts it: ‘Andre is a great fighter but has such an awkward style  that he can’t draw enough fans to fill his own front room.’

Chavez was quick to respond. ‘I welcome a fight with Froch,’ he said. ‘The fight would be huge; Mexico and England have always had a great rivalry in sports. Also, the fight would give me the opportunity to become the first fighter from Mexico to win the  super-middleweight world title.’

Hearn calculates, also: ‘After this performance against Groves, Carl is where the big money is in the super-middleweight division. So there is an orderly queue forming to fight him, if he decides to go again.’

Third time? Froch could complete his trilogy with Mikkel Kessler with both men having won one fight each

Unification: WBC super-middleweight champion Sakio Bika (right) wants to fight Froch

Other options include a rubber match against his old Danish warrior foe Mikkel Kessler, with whom he stands at one win apiece and who has just decided to make a comeback.

WBC champion, tough-nut Sakio Bika, turned up at Wembley carrying his belt and offering a title unifying match.

Bika will also be a target for Groves once he has ‘gone back to the drawing board'.

Shrewdly, Saint George had taken out insurance against a second loss to Froch by signing in advance a big-money contract with his new German promoters, Sauerland.

But exactly where he goes from here depends on how he reacts to being heavily knocked out in the eighth round of a fight which he had trumpeted Froch had ‘no chance of winning’.

Froch said: ‘A defeat like this can either finish a boxer’s career or give him the motivation to come back all the stronger.  It depends on his character. There are one or two other belt-holders out there against whom he might win a world title.

‘But to be honest he lacks the essential element of real hardness to trouble the elite. I doubt he can ever beat Ward. And deep down he knows now I would beat him ten times out of ten.’
