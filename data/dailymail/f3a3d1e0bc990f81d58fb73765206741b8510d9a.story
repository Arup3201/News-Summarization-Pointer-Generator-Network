The U.S. Department of Energy suffered a major security breach after a large cyber-attack that targeted computer networks, it was revealed today.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that an unknown group targeted the government organization two weeks ago and harvested the personal information of several hundred of its employees.

While the agency says that no confidential data was compromised, experts said that attackers could have been targeting that data.

Breach: The Washington headquarters of the Energy Department faced a 'sophisticated' cyber-attack two weeks ago

Sinister intent? A source said that no classified information was compromised, though there is some evidence that the hackers could have been after it

The Free Beacon reports that officials from the Energy Department and the FBI are investigating the ‘sophisticated’ attack at the government agency’s Washington headquarters, and are looking into possible motives for the attack.

A source told the paper that no classified information was compromised, though there is some evidence that the hackers could have been after it.

Among other things, the department includes the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages nuclear power and weapons.

Bill Gibbons, the Deputy Press Secretary for the Energy Department, told MailOnline that the organization is ‘letting the letter of the incident speak for itself,’ and added that he could comment no further on the matter.

The letter, which may be read in full below, was sent out to DOE workers last Friday afternoon. In the note, the department reveals that the full extent of the cyber-hacking was unknown.

The Free Beacon says that there is also indication that Chinese hackers could be to blame.

Chinese hackers are believed to have been behind hackings of three top American newspapers. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post were hacked earlier this month.

Security experts hired by the New York paper to deal with the security breaches found that the hackers routed the attacks through computers at U.S. universities, installed a strain of malicious software associated with Chinese hackers and initiated the attacks from university computers previously used to attack U.S. military contractors.

Retaliation: The New York Times, pictured its office in Midtown Manhattan, claims the Chinese government is seeking to monitor their reporting on the Chinese Premier

The Chinese government had previously threatened to retaliate against the Times for the damaging report. 

The government blocked both the Chinese and English websites in the country after an article in October was published regarding Wen Jiabao's fortune. 

Searches for the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the Chinese government describing the feature as a 'smear.'

A source told Krebs on Security that these hackers seem to have ‘the ability to do anything they wanted on the network.’

Former Energy Department security official Ed McCallum told the Free Beacon that the breach is a ‘continuing story of negligence.’

Meanwhile, the internal letter urges employees to take every security precaution, including encrypting all files and emails, as well as keeping personal emails and files off of government-issued computers.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has just confirmed a recent cyber incident that occurred in mid-January which targeted the Headquarters’ network and resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of employee and contractor Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

The Department is strongly committed to protecting the integrity of each employee’s PII and takes any cyber incident very seriously.

The Department’s Cybersecurity Team, the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the Inspector General’s office are working with federal law enforcement to promptly gather detailed information on the nature and scope of the incident and assess the potential impacts to DOE staff and contractors. Based on the findings of this investigation, no classified data was compromised.

We believe several hundred DOE employees’ and contractors’ PII may have been affected. As individual affected employees are identified, they will be notified and offered assistance on steps they can take to protect themselves from potential identity theft. 

Once the full nature and extent of this incident is known, the Department will implement a full remediation plan.  As more specific information is gathered regarding affected employees and contractors, the Department will make further notifications.

The Department is also leading an aggressive effort to reduce the likelihood of these events occurring again.

These efforts include leveraging the combined expertise and capabilities of the Department’s Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center to address this incident, increasing monitoring across all of the Department’s networks and deploying specialized defense tools to protect sensitive assets.  

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and we all play an important role in maintaining the integrity and security of our networks. To help minimize impacts and reduce any potential risks, please keep the following best practices in mind:
