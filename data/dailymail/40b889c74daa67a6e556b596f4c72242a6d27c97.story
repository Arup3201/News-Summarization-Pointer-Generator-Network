Hundreds of workers at the world's largest electronics manufacturer have rioted at a factory in China, resulting in dozens of arrests.

An estimated 1,000 Employees at the Foxconn plant in Chengdu, southwest China, clashed with security guards who had attempted to prevent a man stealing  on Monday night, according to Taiwan-based news website Want China Times.

Foxconn makes many of the world's most popular gadgets, including Apple's iPhone and iPad, the Amazon Kindle and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles.

The manufacturer has previously come under fire for forcing staff to work long hours and in unsafe conditions for low pay.

The riot at the Foxconn factory in Chengdu, southwestern China, comes after reports of poor working conditions at the plants

Workers reportedly threw bins, chairs and even fireworks at security officers from the upper floors of the building after the riot broke out in a dormitory at the plant.

Two guards had called out to stop a thief but staff took the opportunity to air their grudges at working conditions.

The clash ended after two hours when hundreds of police officers were called to the scene and dozens were arrested.

The riot is the latest high-profile incident to affect Foxconn, which employs up to 120,000 people at its Chengdu plant, and more than one million in total.

An explosion in May last year killed two and injured 16 employees who were working on the iPad 2 production line at the Chengdu factory.

Foxconn's customers, including Apple, have been criticised for failing to encourage changes at the Chinese manufacturer's factories.

An investigation ordered by Apple earlier this year found 'significant' problems at the plants.

Employees can work 76-hour weeks and for 11 days in a row, yet are paid as little as Â£150 a month, around three-quarters the country's average wage and less than half the price of the iPads they produce.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has vowed to work to improve conditions at the plants, where 90 per cent of the technology firm's products are made, including reducing overtime, which the report found some workers were not paid for.

'We want everyone to know what we are doing, and we hope that people copy. We've put a tonne of effort into taking overtime down,' Cook said in May.

The announcement was seen as a landmark decision that would change the way Western companies would deal with Chinese firms.
