A Louisiana mayor whose son is Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu's chief of staff told voters at a private event to vote twice, speaking to a partisan crowd 24 hours before Election Day last month.

Video of Opelousas, Louisiana Mayor Don Cravins Sr.'s Nov. 3 remarks show him telling a crowd in his home town that 'if you "early voted," go vote again tomorrow. One more time’s not going to hurt.'

Louisianans, like Americans in many states, had the option of either voting 'early' or showing up on Election Day. Taking advantage of both options would be a crime.

And for voters worried about criminal fraud charges, Cravins said he had an insurance policy – the re-election of a Democratic district attorney.

SWAMP: Former State Senator Don Cravins, now a Louisiana mayor, told voters a day before Election Day to vote twice. His son is Sen. Mary Landrieu's chief of staff in Washington

ENDANGERED: Sen. Mary Landrieu, the last remaining Democrat on a US Senate ballot, faces an uphill climb in her runoff election on Saturday, but one of her Louisiana advocates said voters should cast more than one ballot each for her

NO PROBLEM: District Attorney Earl Taylor won re-election on Nov. 4, an outcome that Cravins Sr. said – to wild applause – would protect double-dip voters from prosecution

'Tomorrow we’re gonna elect Earl Taylor as the D.A. so he won’t prosecute you if you vote twice,' Cravins said.

Taylor won a fourth term on Nov. 4.

Cravins' remarks were met first by laughs and then by wild cheers as he told the crowd to 'vote number 99' – Mary Landrieu's ballot-line number. 

Landrieu's campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

State Sen. Elbert Guillory introduces the Cravins footage on video, calling it 'shocking, even for the sad swamp of Democrat politics here in Louisiana.' 

Guillory is among a handful of black U.S. politicians to leave the Democratic Party, announcing in 2013 that he had become a Republican. 

Cravins, a former Louisiana state senator, faces a runoff election for another term as mayor against another Democrat on Saturday.

Landrieu's runoff against U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, however, is the main attraction in Louisiana. Cassidy is polling far ahead and a victory by the Republican would give the GOP a total of nine additional seats in the Senate in 2015.

The Black Conservatives Fund PAC, a group that recruits right-leaning African-American political candidates, obtained the video of Cravins' remarks and shared it with MailOnline ahead of an 11:00 a.m. press conference in Louisiana.

After the event, the group released the raw footage from Cravins Sr.'s Nov. 3 speech. 

During that same speech, Cravins told voters that Landrieu would vote with President Barack Obama '97 per cent of the time,' in a jiu-jitsu moment calculated to turn a frequent Republican criticism into an advantage.

That video clip went viral, energizing some in the GOP.  

After word spread Monday morning that the group of center-right African-Americans would release another video clip, Landrieu's campaign announced its own press conference with the senator in Baton Rouge, timed to coincide with the public unveiling.

In an unusual move, the campaign's press advisory did not specify where the event would take place; reporters were told to RSVP to learn that it would take place at a Hilton hotel.

Black Conservatives Fund senior adviser Ali Akbar wrote Monday on Facebook that Landrieu had 'announced she's having a press conference now at the exact same time as we are having ours.'

'I kid you not. She's scared and I bet she lawyered up.'

He said in a statement that Cravins had encouraged voters 'to violate state and federal law by committing voter fraud. He is compromising the integrity of our voting process and likely violating federal and state law himself.'

 

FAVORITE: Bill Cassidy, a GOP congressman hoping to oust Landrieu on Saturday, would be the 54th Republican senator in the new Congress that begins work on January 3

Akbar added that his group had provided the FBI, the Louisiana Secretary of State and the Louisiana Attorney General office with copies of the video.

'We’re pledging our full cooperation with state and federal investigations,' BCF board member Anita MonCrief added.

Landrieu's campaign looks to be in trouble just five days from the runoff. Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that political committee which had previously donated heavily to her have switched their allegiances and are now backing Cassidy.

And according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Republican voters are the only group whose participation in early voting hasn't dropped off during the runoff, compared to the weeks before the Nov. 4 general election.

Landrieu edged Cassidy in that election by 1 percentage point but failed to reach the 50-percent threshold to avoid a runoff. A third candidate, tea-party Republican Rob Maness, captured 13.7 per cent of the vote but later endorsed Cassidy.
