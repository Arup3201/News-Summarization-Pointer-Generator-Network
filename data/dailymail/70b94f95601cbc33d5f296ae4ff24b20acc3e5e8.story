For a millennium, it has stood as a monument to one of the bloodiest struggles in England’s history. Hordes of tourists troop to Battle Abbey to stand at the spot where King Harold fell at the Battle of Hastings.

Now, if the theories of a local historian are to be believed, they may be going to the wrong place.John Grehan claims the spot where the Battle of Hastings is commemorated is not actually where the fighting happened.

According to Mr Grehan, the supposed site of the struggle, marked by Battle Abbey, is a mile away from the real scene of combat in 1066.

Mr Grehan points out that no human 
remains or artefacts from the conflict have ever been found near Battle 
Abbey, even though some 10,000 men are believed to have died there.

His theory is that the real site of the fighting was the steep Caldbec 
Hill, to the north-west of Hastings – and if he is proved right, history
 books around the world may have to be rewritten.

Thousands of tourists flock to Battle Abbey  every year to learn about 
the conflict, which resulted in the death of King Harold and played a 
pivotal role in the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror.

Now Mr Grehan, 61, is calling for the site at Caldbec Hill to be 
excavated to see whether the remains of battle victims are buried there.

The Bayeux Tapestry, part of which is pictured, famously depicts the 1066 battle which saw King Harold supposedly shot through the eye with an arrow in what was a decisive victory for William the Conqueror

He said: ‘I assumed everything was known about the Battle of Hastings 
but I found that almost nothing is known by way of fact. Excavations 
have been carried out at Battle Abbey and remnants pre-dating the battle
 were found, but nothing relating to the conquest. Some 10,000 men died 
at the Battle of Hastings; there has to be a mass grave somewhere.’

It is documented that King Harold assembled his English army on Caldbec 
Hill before advancing on Senlac Hill – or Battle Hill – a mile away to 
meet the invading Normans.

But Mr Grehan believes Harold never left his defensive hilltop position 
and the Normans took the battle to the English. He has studied 
contemporaneous documents in the national archives and built up a 
dossier of circumstantial evidence that he believes proves his theory.

Witness accounts from 1066 state the  battle was fought on steep and 
unploughed terrain, consistent with Caldbec Hill.  Senlac Hill, 
meanwhile, was cultivated and had gentle slopes.

In addition, the Normans erected a cairn of stones on the battle site to
 commemorate their victory, known as a ‘Mount-joie’  in French. The 
summit of Caldbec Hill is still known as Mountjoy. One English source 
from the time, John of Worcester, also stated that the battle was fought
 nine miles from Hastings, the same distance  as Caldbec Hill.

Harold is supposed to have abandoned his high position to meet William 
on lower ground, a tactic that makes no sense as he would have been 
moving away from his reinforcements. Furthermore, Mr Grehan believes he 
has identified the site of a mass grave where the fallen soldiers may be
 buried.

Mr Grehan, from Shoreham, West Sussex, has made his arguments in a book 
called The Battle of Hastings – The Uncomfortable Truth, to be published
 in January.

He added: ‘Two days after the battle the Normans moved on towards 
Winchester. They had two days to get rid of the thousands of bodies. You
 can’t dig that many graves in such a short space of time.

‘At the bottom of Caldbec Hill is Malfosse ditch, I believe the bodies 
were rolled down the hill and dumped in this ditch which was filled in. A
 proper archaeological dig of that ditch needs to happen.’

Roy Porter, the regional curator for English Heritage which owns Battle 
Abbey, said they were obliged to look into alternative theories for the 
battle site.

But he said the spot the abbey is built on is based on a number of historical sources and is documented before 1120.

He added: ‘It would be premature to comment on Mr Grehan’s thesis until the book is published.’

It has historically been believed that the Battle of Hastings took place at a site now known as Battle on October 14 1066. Harold organised his troops in three wedges on Senlac Ridge, overlooking the battlefield.

He had little more than 5,000 weary men who found themselves up against a Norman force of up to 15,000 infantry, archers and cavalry.

Facing such odds, Harold had no choice but to fight a defensive battle.

He was forced to rely on the much-vaunted English shield-wall. His men could stand and let the Norman attacks break themselves.

The tactic was initially very successful. Relentlessly, the Norman knights hurled themselves against the English shields, but were unable to make any headway.

Then the Bretons led by Count Alan on the Norman left began to give way.

The whole incident is portrayed on the famous Bayeux tapestry.

The battle had turned. Now the English wall had broken, and the Normans were able to lever open the cracks.

Exhaustion and the shear numbers of Normans took their toll. Gyrth and Leofwine, the two remaining brothers of Harold were killed according to the Tapestry, and Harold was soon to follow.

We see him  taking an arrow in the eye and then being ridden down by a Norman cavalryman, one of four who managed to break through the English line and trample Harold into the ground.

Though the English still fought on bravely after their king had fallen, their cause was lost, and eventually they fled into the night.
