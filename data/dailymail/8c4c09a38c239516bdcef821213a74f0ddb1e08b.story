Paolo Di Canio stepped up his row with David Miliband yesterday by calling his accusers ‘stupid and ridiculous’.

The new Sunderland manager spoke out after the former foreign secretary quit his role at the football club because of the Italian’s ‘past political statements’.

Di Canio has been accused of fascist sympathies and of giving an open-handed salute to crowds during a match.

David Miliband, right, seen in the stands at the Stadium of Light for Saturday's game against Manchester United, resigned his Sunderland directorship yesterday after the appointment of Paolo Di Canio

Last night he apologised for any offence, saying his comments were made many years ago and taken out of context.

In a statement issued jointly with his new club, he denied he was racist or extremist and said he didn’t want to talk politics.

‘I don’t have a problem with anyone. I haven’t had a problem in the past and I don’t know why I have to keep repeating my story, to be defending myself on something that doesn’t belong to me every time I change clubs,’ he said.

‘Talk about racism? That is absolutely stupid, stupid and ridiculous.’

He added: 'What I can say is that if someone is hurt, I am sorry. But this didn't come from me - it came from a big story that people put out in a different way to what it was.

'The people who know me can change that idea quickly. When I was in England my best friends were Trevor Sinclair and Chris Powell, the Charlton manager - they can tell you everything about my character.

'I don't want to talk about politics because it's not my area. We are not in the Houses of Parliament, we are in a football club. I want to talk about sport.

'I want to talk about football, my players, the board and the fans. I don't want to talk any more about politics - I am not a politics person.'

Mr Miliband quit as vice-chairman and non-executive director on Sunday night.

In a statement on his website, Mr Miliband said: 'I wish Sunderland AFC all the success in the future. It is a great institution that does a huge amount for the North East and I wish the team very well over the next vital seven games.

'However, in the light of the new manager’s past political statements, I think it right to step down.'

There is anger among fans too, with many calling for the 44-year-old to renounce his ‘extremist views’ or resign. On Facebook, a petition against Di Canio’s appointment had 10,000 members yesterday.

Unite Against Fascism's joint 
national secretary, Weyman Bennett, said Di Canio's political views were
'an insult' to the people of Sunderland who died fighting fascism.

Mr Bennett said: 'If he wants to be a
manager and wants to be a public figure, he needs to make it clear he 
accepts these views are completely inappropriate.

'Football has made great strides in 
opposing fascism. It's simply not true that you can say you agree with 
fascism and that's okay. It's something that isn't acceptable.'

And war veteran John Hall, 92, said: ‘I do not believe in fascism.

‘If there was another man of the same calibre who was not a fascist then they should have employed him as manager.’

Di Canio was made manager following 
Saturday’s sacking of Martin O’Neill. When he was made Swindon Town’s 
boss in 2011, the GMB union withdrew its sponsorship.

Last week Mr Miliband, Labour MP for 
South Shields, said he was leaving the country and British politics to 
head an international charity in New York. However, he did not say that 
he was quitting his part-time role at Sunderland.

He joined the Wearside club in February 2011. Since then he has earned £125,000 for just 15 days of work.

As
a boy, Di Canio was a junior member of the 'ultras', or extreme 
supporters, of Lazio, which was founded by Italian army officers in 1900
and reportedly has a tattoo of Mussolini, who supported the club.

He praised Italy’s former fascist dictator in his autobiography as 'basically a very principled, ethical individual'.

His appointment has also upset some fans of Sunderland who are 
proud of the club’s working class and socialist 
background. The Stadium of Light was built on the last Wearside pit and 
has close associations with the remaining miners’ lodges in the region.

When
Di Canio made the fascist salute in 1995, Mussolini’s granddaughter 
Alessandra said: 'What a delightful Roman salute! I was deeply moved.'

Di
Canio, a former striker for West Ham said after the incident to Italian
news agency ANSA in 2005: 'I am a fascist, not a racist.'

Fans said they respected Mr Miliband's decision to step down but said the club's success should take priority over politics.

However, they warned that Di Canio must keep any political views out of football or face being kicked out of the club.

Supporter Stan Simpson, a season ticket holder for 40 years and a Sunderland AFC Supporters' Club member, said some fans would be 'wary' about the Italian's appointment.

'David Miliband has got principles to stick by, and it's a principle. You've got to admire the guy for that,' he said. 'I understand Mr Miliband's decision but there is no way we, as fans, would entertain any fascism in our club.

'As long as he doesn't express any political opinions I can cope with it. I've got no problem with him being there. But if he expresses those sort of opinions while he's there, he should be sacked, it doesn't matter how or where. It's not acceptable in this country.'

Fan Janet Rowan, a long-time supporter and secretary of the Chester-le-Street supporters' group, said she thought Di Canio was 'very passionate' about his involvement in the game but said extremist politics 'isn't something we want in football'.

She added: 'I respect David Miliband's views but as fans we have got to support Di Canio.

'I think with some people, his appointment probably will leave a bad taste but I hope that the majority of fans are going to put Sunderland football club ahead of everything.'
