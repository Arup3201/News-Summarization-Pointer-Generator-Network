Dramatic new footage has emerged from the aftermath of the Kenyan shopping mall massacre of terrified survivors being rescued from a butcher's freezer bolt hole where they were hiding.

The group of men locked themselves inside the walk-in fridge in the supermarket of Nairobi's Westgate Mall when a gang of armed Islamic terrorists stormed the building and opened fire.

For what must have felt like an eternity of whizzing bullets and the 
screams of terrorists and victims alike, the three men cowered in the freezing icebox for hours as the atrocity unfolded outside.

It comes as Somali Islamist group al 
Shabaab suggested the bloodbath, and its subsequent four-day siege, 
would be followed by other attacks by its 'warriors'.

Rescue: Their hands held above their heads, three men emerge from the butcher's freezer after being rescued by Kenyan special forces

Relief: Fear etched across his face, the first to emerge from the giant cooler then turns to the others and says, 'police, police', to reassure them

The video was filmed by civilian security guards who went to the site to help.

'We are civilians,' the guards can be heard saying. 'Put your hands up, put your hands up.'

Fear etched across his face, the first to emerge from the giant cooler then turns to
 the others and says, 'police, police', to reassure them.

Another person can then be heard saying, 'it's ok', as all three men walk out to safety with their hands above their heads.

Morgue officials in Nairobi still expect a
 large influx of bodies still in the mall. Officials have told AP that 
the shopping center, which the terrorists held for four days, could hold
 dozens more bodies. The government has confirmed 72 total deaths: 61 
civilians, six security forces and five attackers. The Red Cross says 71
 people remain missing.

And today al Shabaab issued a new, chilling statement through Twitter after it taunted Kenya during the mall raid when its militants were still holding out.

'The mesmeric performance by the #WestgateWarriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiere of Act 1.'

Kenyan authorities are holding eight people in connection with the attack and have released three others, the interior minister said on Friday.

A top Kenyan military official played down reports of a build up of Kenyan forces near the Somali border, saying that troops who had gathered near Somalia were rotating to join African peacekeepers there and replace other Kenyan soldiers.

Al Shabaab said it launched the attack to demand that Kenya withdraw its troops from Somalia, where Kenyan forces deployed in 2011 to strike at the group which Nairobi blamed for attacks and kidnappings in Kenya's northern area and coastline.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has said Kenya will not withdraw.

Today's video is one of a number of dramatic scenes caught on camera during and after the attack that left at least 71 people dead.

Earlier today, the identity of a man who selflessly saved a mother and her three daughters from the Nairobi shopping mall as gunmen threw grenades and sprayed bullets yards away was revealed.

Hero: Haji became a hero when he helped the Waltons and many others escape the mall after terrorists struck

Somali Muslim Abdul Haji was hailed a hero after a now-iconic photograph of him reaching out to Katherine Walton's four-year-old daughter Portia as she runs away with fear etched on her face was published around the world.

Mrs Walton 
feared she and her children would not get out alive after becoming 
trapped under a table outside a supermarket in the Westgate complex.

But
 they were saved by Mr Haji, the son of a former Kenyan security 
minister, who bravely ushered them to safety as he fired back at the 
terrorists with a handgun.

Speaking of her terrifying ordeal, she told the Daily Telegraph: 'We were just going to meet my two older boys in the supermarket when we heard an explosion,' said Walton, 38, who moved to Kenya from North Carolina two years ago.

Chilling new threat: Al Shabaab issued a new threat on Twitter today hailing 'the mesmeric performance by the #WestgateWarriors' and promised that this was 'just the premiere of Act 1'

‘I grabbed the girls and started 
running. A woman pulled us behind a promotional table opposite. I could 
see the bullets hitting above the shops and hear the screaming all 
around us.'

When they were 
too afraid to move as group, it was four-year-old Portia who emerged 
from under the table and became part of the unforgettable image captured
 during the Kenya mall siege.

The
 girl is seen running toward Haji, whose hand is outstretched. Behind 
her, Walton and the others can just barely be made out crouching beneath
 an Asus promotional table.

‘I don't know how she knew to do it but she did,’ Walton told the Telegraph. ‘She did what she was told and she went.

'I think I owe Mr 
Haji a hug or two.'

Al-Shabab said the Kenyan government assault team carried out 'a demolition' of the building, burying 137 hostages in the debris. A government spokesman denied the claim and said Kenyan forces were clearing all rooms Wednesday, firing as they moved and encountering no one.

Men were said to have been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before being blinded and hanged during the four day siege

The al-Shabab claim appeared to refer to the rocket-propelled grenades fired inside the Nakumatt department store, in the incident described to AP by a government official.

In a series of tweets from a Twitter account believed to be genuine, al-Shabab also said that 'having failed to defeat the mujahideen inside the mall, the Kenyan govt disseminated chemical gases to end the siege.'

Kenyan government spokesman Manoah Esipisu told AP that no chemical weapons were used — including tear gas — and that the collapse of floors in the mall was caused by a fire set by the terrorists.

'Al-Shabab is known for wild allegations and there is absolutely no truth to what they're saying,' he said. But officials said the death count will likely rise.
