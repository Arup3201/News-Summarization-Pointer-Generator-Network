A robber who followed a pensioner home to rip the gold chain off her neck was caught thanks to a suspicious shopkeeper who filmed him earlier in the day. 

Sadaqat Khan was sitting in his car outside the post office he runs in Eccles, Manchester, when he noticed Aleksandras Bogdanovic acting suspiciously behind a 76-year-old woman.

The 35-year-old started filming the criminal who, once out of view, followed the woman home and robbed her.

Mr Khan handed his footage over to police when questioned about the attack in his post office the following day. 

Bogdanovic, 27, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court after a jury was shown the footage taken on Mr Khan's phone.  

'I was sat in my car when I noticed him. He looked dodgy, like he was up to no good and we’d had a phone snatch nearby a few days before so I watched him for about five minutes,' said Mr Khan, who was awarded £300 for his assistance. 

'When I saw him start to walk behind the old lady I took pictures and video of him on my mobile phone.

'The police came in later that day and said an old lady had been robbed so I handed the footage straight over and said that might be him. It was a terrible crime.

'I’m just glad I’ve been able to help put this man where he belongs and help my community and, hopefully, give her some peace of mind.'

Det Con Paul Davies of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Bogdanovic targeted an elderly woman because of her vulnerability. 

'He then forced her through the trauma of going to court knowing full well what he had done. The evidence against him was overwhelming due to the fantastic community spirit we have in this area.

'Mr Khan captured him following the victim home and this was backed up by CCTV from local businesses.'
