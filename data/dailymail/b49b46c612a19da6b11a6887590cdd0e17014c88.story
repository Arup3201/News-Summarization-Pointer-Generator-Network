New country: Doug Leguin, 60, took over a Dallas neighborhood on Monday as he attempted to secede from the nation

A 60-year-old man terrorized an expensive Dallas neighborhood as he attempted to secede from the U.S. and start his own nation called 'Dougiestan'.

It's still unclear what drew Doug Leguin, of Corinth, to the upscale neighborhood where he lured police with a fake 911 call reporting a fire.

Leguin proceeded to shoot at responding officers, while a nanny and 8-year-old child holed up for protection in a nearby mansion.

No one was injured in the incident, and Leguin was later apprehended and charged with seven counts of aggravated assault on a public servant. He remains held on $350,000 bail at the Dallas County Jail.

The incident started to unfold Tuesday afternoon when Leguin's wife called police to report her husband missing.

She said he hadn't gone to work and there was an AK-47, ammunition and several propane tanks missing from their garage.

Police say Leguin first tried to enter a home on the 5500 block of North 40th Place, but the nanny who answered the door refused to let him in and went to find a safe place inside the home to hide with the 8-year-old girl in her care.

Outside, Leguin called police himself to report a fire in the neighborhood where he had set several traps and propane tanks. He also flipped the home's American flag upside down.

Attack: Leguin first tried to enter this mansion, but was refused by the nanny who answered the door. Instead, he camped out in a wooded area where he waited for officers to arrive

Shots fired: Leguin shot at seven responding officers while the nanny and the 8-year-old child she was looking after hid in the house

Once firefighters and police arrived, Leguin changed his story and told the dispatcher that he was seceding from the U.S. and forming his own country because he was frustrated with the current government.

'I'm Dougie Doug and I just seceded from the nation,' the caller said. 'I've seceded from the nation. This is now Dougiestan right here.'

'I'm pissed off at America. America is broke. It's got a sorry government, and the people won't vote,' he continued.

He also said he was upset with the Dallas Police for 'shooting the mentally handicapped'.

When asked if he had been diagnosed with anything, Leguin said 'a clear mind and a full heart'.

He then threatened to shoot any police officer who came forward and even shot at a propane tank which exploded.

Damage: A bullet hole is pictured on a vehicle from the shootout

Friends say Leguin works as a chandelier installer, which may explain why he chose the rich neighborhood on Monday.

He was eventually arrested when police surrounded him in a wooded area adjacent to the house. They found Leguin in possession of 750 rounds of ammunition

According to friend Lee Bamburg, Leguin is a left-leaning libertarian who has struggled with health issues recently.

'He is not anti-government, he is not anti-American, and he wants you to start thinking and to stop letting other people think for you,' Bamburg told Fox Dallas/Forth Worth. 'I think he wants you to listen and go vote.'

Bamburg says Leguin, a diabetic, had developed tremors in his hands recently which may have made his job stressful. 

He believes Leguin didn't intend to hurt anyone in the incident since he knows how to shoot a gun and would have shot someone if he wanted to.

Bamburg says Leguin probably shot at the officers to 'prolong the situation'. 

Neighbors in Leguin's Corinth neighborhood were also shocked to hear the news.

'He is very grandparent-like,' neighbor Tosha Price told NBC. 'Passive, softspoken.'
