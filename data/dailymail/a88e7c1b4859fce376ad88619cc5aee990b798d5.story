Erik Lamela has promised Spurs fans he'll live up to his £30million price tag this season.

Tottenham splashed out on the Argentine star last summer, but injuries put paid to him making any real impact.

The 22-year-old made just 17 appearances in all competitions last campaign, netting a solitary goal against FC Sheriff in the Europa League.

Fresh beginning: Erik Lamela is back in pre season training with Tottenham and wants to prove he's not a flop

Difficulties: Lamela was widely criticised for his poor performances last season following his £30million move

International pedigree: The 22-year-old has six Argentina caps but was left out of their World Cup squad

But Lamela has now promised White Hart Lane will play host to the 'real' him - so highly rated when starring in Serie A for Roma.

'A footballer always feels lonely when he cannot play for whatever reason and I felt very lonely at times last season,' he told the Sun.

'But I am getting in good shape and am determined to show Tottenham the real Erik Lamela this season.

'I have recovered from my injuries, we have a new manager and i cannot wait to play.

'I am confident you will see a much better me this season.'

All smiles: Tottenham's £30million man poses for a photo with LA Lakers' Steve Nash on Spurs' US tour

Disappointing: A single goal against FC Sheriff was not enough for Spurs fans from their £30million buy

New start: Lamela has a whole new chance to impress under new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino
