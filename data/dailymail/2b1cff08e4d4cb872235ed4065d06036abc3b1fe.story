Arrested: Tina Baldwin, 47, is the mother of Ashley Baldwin, who began working at the abortion clinic when she was just 15 years old

A woman who interned at an abortion clinic for years starting when she was 15 testified in court Thursday about seeing at least five aborted babies moving, breathing, and in once case, 'screeching.'

Ashley Baldwin, now 22, recalled the horrifying detail before a jury at the murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, her employer at the Women's Medical Society clinic in Pennsylvania.

Baldwin said she helped perform countless late-term procedures where aborted babies would show obvious signs of life outside the womb.

'They just looked like regular babies,' Baldwin said.

One baby was so big that Gosnell joked to her, 'This baby is going to walk me home,' the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Gosnell, 72, is charged with seven counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of seven infants born alive during abortions.

He allegedly killed the babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors.

If found guilty, Gosnell faces a possible death sentence.

Baldwin recalled seeing the doctor use scissors to 'snip' the necks of newborns who were moving outside the womb.

Her testimony supports that of Lynda 
Williams, 44, who also testified this week to seeing babies have their 
necks snipped by Gosnell.

Baldwin's remarks to the jury ended the fourth week of testimony in the trial, which is set to resume on Monday.

Now the mother of a two-year-old, 
Baldwin said she started working for Gosnell at such a young age because
she had dreams of becoming a doctor.

Her mother, 47-year-old Tina Baldwin, 
also worked at the clinic and she has pleaded guilty to racketeering, 
conspiracy and corrupting a minor - her daughter - in connection with 
the case.

Gosnell is also charged with 
corrupting a minor and with one count of third-degree murder in the 
death of Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old patient who was killed by an 
overdose of pain medication administered during an abortion procedure.

Ashley Baldwin said she was at the 
clinic the night of Mongar's death in 2009 and that Gosnell had asked 
her to plug in a defibrillator while he was pumping her chest.

'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009

Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there

'I got a small shock when I plugged it in,' Baldwin said. 'It didn't work.'

Earlier in the week, another former clinic worker, Lynda Williams, said Gosnell taught her how to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps.'

She added it was one of her duties to pick up babies that women would spontaneously give birth to in the waiting room after getting large doses of drugs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Like many of Gosnell's employees, Williams was desperate for work when he gave her a job.

She had a poor education and had not even finished eighth grade, although went on to work as an instrument sterilizer. During this job, she met Gosnell who performed abortions at the clinic.

But
her life began spiralling out of control when her husband was murdered 
in 2008 and she was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She asked 
Gosnell if he had any work for her.

He hired her to sterilize instrument and soon asked her to carry out ultrasounds, administering intravenous medication and anesthesia to patients.

She
told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients
that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit.

She
added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - 
and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, 
leaving his hand print behind.

Her testimony came a day after 
another worker, Sherry West, told the court how she was once handed an 
underdeveloped newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it.

Rundown: An internal shot of the clinic, which was allegedly reeking of animal urine and feces

Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped'.

Some told the court of gruesome 
scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with 
rusting surgical instruments.

A Grand Jury report said the clinic was
crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and
blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly 
sterilized.

Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed 
into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and 
plastic jugs'.

'It
would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is 
literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC.

But he said he believed the 
intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the 
women, often extremely poor, who came to him

The doctor: Kermit Gosnell

Charged: Pearl Gosnell

Employee: Elizabeth Hampton

Arrested: Tina Baldwin

Assistant: Sherry West

Worker: Adrine Moton

Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil

Locked up: Stephen Massof

Held: Maddline Joe

'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said.

The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. 

Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. 

Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any 
babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the 
aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.
