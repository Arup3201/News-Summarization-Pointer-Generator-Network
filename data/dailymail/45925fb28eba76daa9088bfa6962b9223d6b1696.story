A Michigan oncologist has been set a $9 million bond by a federal judge after being accused of intentionally misdiagnosing cancer patients in Detroit to scam Medicare.

Judge Sean Cox made the ruling Tuesday, following a hearing in which prosecutors asked him to increase Dr. Farid Fata's $170,000 bond to $9 million, based on the assets available to him and his wife.

They fear 48-year-old Dr Fata, who was born in Lebanon, may try to flee the country.

Cox also ordered that Fata not practice medicine if he's released on bond.

Defense lawyer Christopher Andreoff wanted a much lower cash bond amount for Fata. He says his client is a U.S. citizen and not a flight risk.

The
government says Dr Fata, who owns Michigan Hematology Oncology, ripped 
off Medicare by giving chemotherapy to patients who didn't need it and 
diagnosing cancer when it wasn't apparent.

Prosecutors are still looking for victims in the case, according to CBS Detroit affiliate WWJ.

Patients
of Dr Fata who have questions concerning their medical records or 
information regarding the investigation are urged to call the U.S. 
Attorney's Office Information Line at 888-702-0553.

The oncologist is accused of bilking the federal government out of millions of dollars in Medicare from the unnecessary chemotherapy to patients in remission.

According
to federal prosecutors, Dr. Fata, of Oakland Township, 'systematically 
defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were 
medically unnecessary.'

According
to the complaint, Fata defrauded the federally funded healthcare 
program out of roughly $35million over a two-year period.

On
Tuesday, federal authorities took Fata into custody and raided several 
of his offices in the Detroit area, seizing medical records they say 
will show that he was misdiagnosing patients in a scam to steal from the
federal government.

'Violating a patient's trust and placing them at risk through fraudulent
abuse of our nation's health care system is deplorable,' FBI Special 
Agent in Charge Robert D. Foley III said in a news release.

At
a bond hearing on Friday, Jeff Berz, whose father was one of Fata's 
patients, testified that Fata refused to stop administering drugs after 
his father didn't respond to chemotherapy.

History: Oncology nurse Angela Swantek says she complained to investigators about Fata in 2010

'From the time that my father began getting the chemotherapy, his health deteriorated,' he said.

Angela
Swantek, an oncology nurse who spent time at one of Fata's clinics, 
told ABC News that she first complained to investigators about Fata's 
alleged wrongdoings as far back as 2010.

'I
don't know how he's gotten away with it for this long,' she told ABC 
News. 'I was disgusted. I got in the car, I was still sitting in the 
parking lot and I was truly almost in tears just because of what I saw 
and how patients were getting their chemotherapy.'

Fata's attorney, Christopher Andreoff, says the government is wrong and that his client is not guilty of anything.

'The
government has not retained an expert to give an opinion that there was
a mistreatment, or misdiagnosis, or unnecessary tests given to any 
patient,' he said.

If convicted, Fata faces up to 20 years in jail.
