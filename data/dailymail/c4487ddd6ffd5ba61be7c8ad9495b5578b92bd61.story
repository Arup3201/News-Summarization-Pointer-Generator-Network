Mugshot: Manchester golfer Rachel Connor escapes jail over her DUI after her guilty plea

British golfer Rachel Connor has escaped jail in the U.S. after she agreed to a plea bargain for a DUI-charge, a Florida court representative said today.

The 21-year-old was arrested in March when she was pulled over by police and breathalysed at almost double the legal limit.

Ms Connor was returning from a golf event and was busted for drink-driving with married former NFL star Eddie George in the passenger seat.

The Manchester-born pro, who competed on the secondary LPGA Futures Tour in 2011, was pulled over near Sarasota, 60 miles south of Tampa.

Her passenger, 38-year-old American footballer George, was not arrested, but was forced to release a statement denying allegations of cheating, saying Miss Connor was just a friend who had offered him a lift home, TMZ reports.

Before her arrest the pair had been taking part in the Archie Griffin Celebrity Golf Classic at The Concession in east Manatee County.

During the evening, Connor tweeted a picture of her posing with George at an event, captioned:  'The lovely Eddie George.'

A police report said officers began following the car after they spotted it travelling at 40mph in a 20mph area.

The deputy officer wrote that the car then began to weave in the lane and he pulled the vehicle over.

The Herald Tribune said the deputy 'smelled a very strong odor of alcoholic beverage' when he approached the vehicle.

Miss Connor reportedly failed walking and counting tests and her blood alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit.

She told police she had only consumed two vodka and cranberries during the evening but wished she had not gotten behind the wheel of her car.

Rachel Connor has agreed to plea 
guilty to driving under the influence, and will instead be sentenced to 
12 months’ probation and 50 hours of community service as a result of 
the bargain with Sarasota County’s State Attorney’s office

It is expected that the court will also suspend her driver’s licence for 6 months and have her car impounded for 10 days.

Speaking to TMZ, she said: ‘I made a mistake, one that I will regret for a long time to come and I don't wish to hide from it.’

‘I am extremely sorry for letting [my young fans] down and I promise to lead by better example now and in the future.’
