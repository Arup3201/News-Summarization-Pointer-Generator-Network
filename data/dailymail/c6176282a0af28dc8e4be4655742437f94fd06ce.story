A former soldier in Hawaii has been sentenced to life in prison after beating his five-year-old daughter to death in an attack so brutal she was left with knuckle imprints on her tiny chest.

Naeem Williams, 35, and his daughter Talia Williams's stepmother, Delilah Williams, assaulted the little girl almost daily during the seven months she lived with them at their military home in 2005.

They used both belts and their fists to beat the youngster - in at least one case, until they 'felt a bone crack'. During the fatal attack, Naeem Williams punched Talia in the chest, leaving  visible imprints.

The U.S. Department of Justice later sought the death penalty against Williams for the murder of his daughter, which occurred at the married couple's  home at Wheeler Army Air Force Base in Wahiawa.

However, last year, the jury that had earlier convicted Williams of murder deliberated for a week on his sentence - either life in prison without parole or execution - before declaring they were deadlocked.

Because the panel could not reach a consensus, the judge was required to sentence Williams to a life term, capping what was the first death penalty case to go to trial in Hawaii since it became a state.

On Friday, a federal judge in Honolulu fulfilled his task to imprison the killer for life. Now, Williams - whose wife worked at a day-care facility at the Army base - will spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Although Hawaii's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957, Talia's murder took place on Army property, and the case was tried in federal court, where the death penalty is allowed.

During a long and emotional trial last year, jurors heard graphic testimony about how Williams and his spouse often beat Talia at Schofield Barracks, partly because of her bathroom accidents.

Taking to the stand, Delilah Williams said that she and her husband had decided to pull her step-daughter out of elementary school because they were worried that officials would notice the abuse.

'She started having marks on her body,' Delilah Williams said, adding that she and Naeem Williams would often curse at Talia, as well as calling her names and hitting her almost daily.

In shocking testimony, Delilah Williams told of how her husband had bound his daughter to a bedpost with duct tape, before beating her with a belt while she had a 'pleading look' on her face. 

She said that she had attempted the taping routine once herself, but had found it was not effective because the girl could squirm around. 'It required too much effort,' she added.

Although the step-mother delivered most of her testimony was delivered with an even, calm voice, she sounded like she was going to cry when she described a beating  on June 29, 2005.

Delilah Williams said she had come home from work that day to find Talia had wet herself.

'I started stomping on her,' she told the court through glistening eyes. 'I just continued stomping on her until it felt like a bone cracked under my foot and she defecated on herself.'

Victim: Naeem Williams will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the murder of Talia (pictured, left and right, before her death in July 2005). Delilah Williams was previously sentenced to 20 years in prison

She forced the child to sit on a toilet and pushed on her stomach so hard that a toilet pipe broke, causing a leak. She said she then grabbed Talia by the hair and slammed her head against a wall.

Delilah Williams was jailed for 20 years in 2014 as part of a plea agreement for the July 2005 murder.

During proceedings leading up to Naeem Williams's death penalty sentencing last June, his family, including his daughter, nine, and  son, 11, testified that they love him and that his life has value.

Williams read a statement to jurors apologizing for killing Talia and asking them to let him live.
