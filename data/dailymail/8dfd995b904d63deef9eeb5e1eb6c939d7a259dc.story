Fresh from leading his side to a 95-run over India in the World Cup semi-final, Australia captain Michael Clarke was temporarily stumped by a reporter's line of questioning during the post-match press conference. 

Flanked by team-mate Steve Smith, who hit 105 off just 93 balls to propel Australia to victory, Clarke fielded questions from the assembled media following his side's seismic victory. 

'Michael you've had tremendous sex as Australia captain,' asked BBC reporter Stephan Shemilt before correcting himself and re-stating that he intended to say 'success'.

'Interesting,' a clearly amused Clarke replied amid a chorus of laughter among the assembled press.

'You might have that as well I don't know,' replied Shemilt.

'How well do you know me. That's a question for my wife,' Clarke added, as Smith struggled to contain his laughter at the top table.

Australia will face arch rivals New Zealand in Sunday's World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The Black Caps are the only unbeaten team of the tournament so far, having trumped Australia as well in the pool stages, but Clarke said told Sky Sports World Cup: 'We're playing some really good cricket at the moment.

'Losing to New Zealand gave us that kick up the backside. I still don't think we've played the perfect game yet. I think we've improved every game and now we're excited to be in the final.

'I think the boys have played some outstanding cricket. Smithy was exceptional once again. He's hitting the ball so sweetly, and I'm really proud of the execution under pressure there from our bowlers.'

Smith's century comes in a tournament that has already seen him make scores of 95, 72 and 65, and the stand-in Test captain hopes there is plenty left in the bag for Sunday.

'Another big hundred would be nice,' he said. 'It's nice to contribute to a few wins. It was a pretty big stage, the semi-final of a World Cup. I'm just happy that we got over the line in the end.'
