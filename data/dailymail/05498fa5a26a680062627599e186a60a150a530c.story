Australian journalist Peter Greste has thanked Foreign Minister Julie Bishop for using her 'laser-like eyes' to secure his release from an Egyptian prison, comparing her to the Terminator.

Speaking at The National Press Club in Canberra, Mr Greste, who has now been a free man for seven weeks, paid a special tribute to Ms Bishop, claiming she had brought out her famous stare which he described as her 'secret weapon'. 

'One person... commented on your uncanny ability to smile very warmly   and at the same time burn holes through the back of their skulls giving them the distinct impression that they've just been hugged by the Terminator,' Mr Greste said to the room full of journalists.

Mr Greste continued, bringing up a touching moment when he saw Ms Bishop speaking on the steps of Parliament House while he was still in prison serving his 400 days.

'I remember being quite shocked, quite surprised by how emotional you seemed and also upset and angry in a way that you don’t often hear from a politician,' he said.  

'It took me a moment for the penny to drop that actually you were talking about me. This was on the day after our conviction and that was a very emotional moment.'

Mr Greste addressed the minister, thanking her for her involvement in his case and her constant pioneering for his release.  

'Your personal involvement and the involvement of a lot of Australia's politicians really made a difference to all of us in prison because it meant that our cause wasn't personal.

'It wasn't just about us against the Egyptian government - we had the backing of the entire Australian government and indeed the Australian people and that meant more than you can possibly imagine,' he said.  

The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed back on Australian soil in early February after spending 400 days in jail.

He was convicted in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi.

Greste was released from prison and deported after a presidential 'approval,' according to an Egyptian prison official and the nation's official news agency. 

The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year.

During his speech, Mr Greste  brought up his ongoing trial and that of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed.

'The way that this trial seems to be going  is encouraging' Mr Greste said. 

'We've learned to take nothing for granted. Things are positive, we know we've done nothing wrong and we've broken no law.'

He also said that his ethnicity played a huge role in his release and it is a fact that cannot be ignored.

However he said he is coping well following his release and is settling back into his normal life.  

'What's become evident since I got out is the scale of the campaign,' he said. 

'I'm not sure that I have coped. I feel a little bit like the rabbit in the headlights'

'This hasn't damaged me. I'm going to stick my neck out and guess one of you had imagined what it would be like for you in prison. 

'Every single one of us is far stronger than we give ourselves credit for. 

'I discovered my limits are further than I ever thought they would be'

Mr Greste also thanked Griffith College for delivering 'around 13kg' of academic work to the embassy so he could complete his Masters in International Relations.  

Mr Greste also talked about press freedom and how he has been spending his time since his release 

Speaking about Freedom of Speech, Mr Greste said he was he has 'concerns' about the growing threat to press freedom. 

'We're not meant to be friends of the government or politicians we're supposed to hold them to account and we shouldn't be apologetic for that,' Mr Greste said when questioned.  

'I am quite disturbed by the lack of coverage of world affairs in the Australian press. We don't pay enough attention to what's happening in the world around us.
