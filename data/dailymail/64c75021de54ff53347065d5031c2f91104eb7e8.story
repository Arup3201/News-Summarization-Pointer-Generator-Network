Is this the the slowest police chase ever?

A video of an Auckland man gliding away from for police in a shopping trolley has gone viral, garnering over four million views and over 115,000 likes on Facebook.

The 29-second clip shows a man leaning over a trolley and rolling down Queen St in Auckland, before a police car appears to spot him and pursue him down the street with sirens blazing.

Onlookers cheer the man on as he veers around the corner, with one man urging him to 'go faster brother!'

The video, which is filmed on a sunny day, does not reveal who the mystery trolley rider is nor when it was filmed.

New Zealand police have denounced the clip, declaring the conduct of the man could be worthy of prosecution.

Auckland City district road policing manager Regan James told Stuff NZ 'The individual may think this is a joke but it is clearly a dangerous activity which puts himself and others at risk.'

'A shopping trolley travelling at speed in this way on a busy CBD road with multiple road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles, has the potential to cause serious injury to an adult pedestrian or, even worse, to a child', he said.

'Without information about the date this occurred, we are unable to say what the outcome of this incident was. We can, however, say a warning or even prosecution for using a vehicle carelessly could be considered.'

Auckland police have denounced the clip as being reckless, claiming the man could be liable for prosecution

The video has been reposted by several prominent Facebook pages, including LAD Bible and Fortafy.

It has garnered a wealth of comments from New Zealanders, such as Robert Danbury, who posted: 'Never have I been more proud to be a New Zealander.'

LAD Bible, an English based page, has over 7 million followers around the world.
