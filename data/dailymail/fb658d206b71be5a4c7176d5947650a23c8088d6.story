Best Buy stores have been targeted by a prankster who has placed worthless plastic boxes on the shelves complete with authentic labels.

The black boxes have product tags in the style of the American discount electrical giant that read 'Useless PLASTICBOX 1.2' for $99.99.

The labels read: 'Another gadget you don't really need.

'Will not work once you get it home. New model out in 4 weeks. Battery life is too short to be of use.'

The 'useless plastic boxes' with detailed product tags have appeared at Best Buy stores around Los Angeles

Street artist Plastic Jesus is believed to be behind the prank and designed the labels that read 'Another gadget you don't really need. Will not work once you get it home. Battery life too short to be of use.'

The detailed labels initially look genuine and come with a bar-code, a QR code and the brand's 'Geek Squad Protection' offer.

However, a closer inspection shows that instead of the usual Manufactures Warrenty (sic), it reads: 'There is no warrenty (sic) with this piece of c**p.

'If you are dumb enough to buy it you deserve all you get.'

The boxes have been made to look like the latest 'must have' gadget and placed on shelves at stores in and around the Los Angeles area.

The prank appears to be the work of LA-based street artist, Plastic Jesus, who has been compared to Banksy. 

The artist's Twitter feed tweeted pictures of the plastic box lined up next to a $129.99 TomTom.

He wrote: 'Bestbuy gets product bombed prankster hits LA stores and plants authentic looking 'Useless Plastic Box 1.2'.

The prank boxes were placed on shelves next to satnav devices, tablets and other electrical goods

Plastic Jesus said the project was motivated by his concerns about consumerism

The artist told blog Melrose and Fairfax that the boxes were motivated by concerns about consumerism.

He said: 'We are sold these gadgets in a way that makes us think THIS new gadget is THE one. The piece of kit will transform our lives.

'The frustration these things actually create in our lives is far greater than any possible benefits.

'We need to make a strong statement to gadget manufacturers and demand that work and customer support that actually support the customer and not the profit of the companies.'

The artist hit the headlines last year when his street-stencil of Lance Armstrong cycling with a drip was shared worldwide.

He is also known for satirical comments on gun crime, Google and the financial cliff.

Jon Sandler, a spokesman for Best Buy, said: 'A few stores were affected and the boxes were removed immediately. 

'We are also flattered that Best Buy is so top of mind for Mr. Plastic Jesus, and are happy that he presumably had the opportunity to witness our expert Blue Shirts and Geek Squad members in action during his visits. 

'Hopefully he also had the chance to check out our fabulous back to school deals.'
