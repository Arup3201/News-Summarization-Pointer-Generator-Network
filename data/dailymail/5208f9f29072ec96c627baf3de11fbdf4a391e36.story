Successful IT expert Martin Strain, 34, was found dead on 1 August - he was waiting to see a consultant about his depression

A loving husband in despair at being told he had to wait  months to see a specialist for depression was found dead, his family said today.

Martin Strain, 34, from Batley, West Yorkshire, seemed 'jolly' and put on a mask, but was in fact suffering acute mental illness, his parents said.

The IT expert had been signed off work with the condition since February and was on antidepressants prescribed by his doctor.  He had also seen his company doctor, who noted that with proper treatment he should make a full recovery.

In April, Mr Strain's GP decided his condition was so severe he needed to see a consultant, but he was told the next available appointment was not until 4 October.

Mr Strain was found dead on 1 August.

Lindsey Strain, his wife and partner of ten years, broke the news to the family that her husband had died, and police attended and reported no suspicious circumstances.

An inquest into Mr Strain's death has been opened and adjourned.

Today Mr Strain's father Adrian, a retired head teacher and volunteer Samaritan from Leeds, said his son's friends had been shocked to learn that he'd been suffering from depression.

He said: 'There was a mask there. He would come across as a very jolly person... [but he] could not shake those feelings off.

'Early intervention is essential when people have mental health problems. Faster access to therapy could save lives.' 

His mother, Caroline, said: 'For cancer we talk of the need for early detection - prevention being better than cure. 

'But for the millions suffering depression, we wait until they can't cope, til they stop showing up for work, put them on tablets and ask them to wait half a year to see a therapist.

'If we treated people with other diseases like this, the country would be rightly outraged and something would be done.'

Mr Strain was waiting for an appointment with the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies serviced, delivered in Batley by South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Trust and commissioned by North Kirklees CCG.

A trust spokesman said: 'The NHS would never be able to comment on an individual case.'

Geoff Heyes, of mental health charity Mind, said: 'Unfortunately we hear from many people who face lengthy waiting times for psychological therapies, and the tragic case of Martin Strain shows how important early intervention is.

'Talking therapies can be really helpful for people with mental health problems, but it's really important that patients are referred quickly, ideally within 28 days. 

'In certain parts of the country this is not happening.' 

He said recent research  found that one in ten people were waiting more than a year to access talking treatments.
