Just one of more than 200 Afghan interpreters who say they've been threatened by the Taliban for their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa.

Most have instead been simply told to change their mobile phone numbers and switch their usual routes to avoid being attacked, The Times said.

But they say the threat of violent reprisals from the Taliban has grown since British forces finally withdrew from Helmand last month. Many fear for their lives.

One 25-year-old who worked with British troops in Helmand for three years and has been forced into hiding away from his wife and children told The Times he felt abandoned.

'I have been facing very serious problems. The Taliban know I have worked for the coalition forces and they are looking for me,' he told The Times' defence editor Deborah Haynes.

'They have tried a couple of attacks either to capture or kill me. That is the reason I am not staying at home and I tell nobody whenever I visit my home.'

Up to 600 Afghan civilian workers are understood to be eligible for relocation to Britain under an immigration scheme available to those with at least a year's continuous service who were still in their posts in December 2012.

So far 31 former interpreters and their families have moved to the UK under the scheme, The Times reports. Their residency visas last five years, at the end of which they will be expected to return to Afghanistan.

But the system for assessing the risk to those who left the job before that date has been criticised by workers facing Taliban violence as a result of their employment by the Army.

That cut-off point, they say, excludes many of those most at risk – men who were the 'eyes and the ears' of the British during the worst of the bloody fighting in Helmand province in the five years up to 2010 – and now live in fear after being forced to quit because of a campaign of terror by the Taliban.

Of more than 200 claims, seven were classified 'amber' risk, qualifying them for assistance relocating within Afghanistan, and just one case was put in the 'red' bracket, meaning a move to the UK.

British troops withdraw from Afghanistan: Since the UK ended operations in the country last month, local former workers say threats and intimidation from the Taliban have intensified

Last year a Daily Mail investigation spoke to 31 current and former British military and intelligence interpreters in Afghanistan and all claimed to be in fear of their lives after receiving specific and personal death threats.

They described how their relatives had been killed and tortured by militants looking for them, how they have had to move home regularly and how their children have to be taken out of school.

Many said they had been regularly threatened by telephone voice and text messages despite repeatedly changing and destroying SIM cards. In one of the most disturbing claims, some said they had been threatened by members of the Afghan police and Afghan National Army.

Some had already suffered appalling injuries working alongside British troops in combat situations.

In July the former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown accused the government of 'shaming the nation' for failing to process visa applications for Afghan interpreters quickly enough. 

Last year Winston Churchill's great-grandson Alexander Perkins, an Afghanistan veteran, delivered a petition to Downing Street demanding asylum for those who helped British forces. 

The U.S., Australia and Germany have all granted asylum to interpreters who worked with their soldiers while fighting in Afghanistan.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'We take reports of threats and intimidation very seriously and investigate all cases thoroughly, taking action as appropriate in consultation with the LEC (locally engaged civilian).

'The intimidation policy provides a robust and responsive means for addressing these concerns and we regularly encourage LECs to report any issues.'
