Authorities are searching for a Washington woman who was last seen walking away from a campground in nothing but a fanny pack to go on a 'spiritual quest'.

Maureen Kelly, 19, went missing early Sunday night from the Canyon Creek Campground in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest Washington, according to KPTV.

A friend told the Skamania County Sheriff's office that Kelly left the campsite to go on a naked 'spiritual quest' with nothing but a fanny pack, but she never returned.

Missing: Maureen Kelly, 19, went missing in a mountainous area of Washington state wearing nothing but a fanny pack after leaving to go on a 'spiritual quest'

Lost: Vancouver resident Maureen Kelly, 19, was last seen in the Canyon Creek Campground at the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state

Wild: Maureen Kelly, 19, went missing in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest that is located some 60 miles northeast from Portland, Ore.

Searching: Along with the local sheriff's office, volunteer search crews have been looking for missing 19-year-old Maureen Kelly for more than 24 hours

Search crews are baffled at the naked hiker's movements through the forest, located some 60 miles northeast of Portland. The area of the forest where she was last seen, Canyon Creek, is steep and mountainous with heavy timber and brush, according to The Associated Press.

Crews searching for Kelly believe she crossed a creek from the campground, climbing to the other side of the canyon.

'Where she entered the creek is amazingly steep. It’s called Canyon Creek Campground for a reason,' Sharon Ward of Pacific Crest Search Dogs told KPTV. 'It’s very, very steep. So how she got down there barefoot is a wonder. And how she came up out of the bottom is a wonder.'

After the paved road, the Kelly's 
tracks stopped. On Monday the search team attempted to find where Kelly 
left the path and entered the woods.

Search crews still don't know if Kelly is on a road, trail or if she's moving through the forest.

Kelly was reportedly carrying a small knife and a compass in the fanny pack, but authorities worry she was not prepared to survive the elements without clothing.

'We had a fairly mild evening last night with temperatures in the lower 50s,' Skamania County under sheriff Dave Cox told KPTV on Monday. 'We have set up a command post in the area and currently are utilizing ground search teams in the immediate area in an attempt to locate her this morning.”

Authorities searched for the young Vancouver, Wash., resident until midnight Monday with no success. They will continue to search for her Tuesday.

The Skamania County Sheriff’s Office is asking anyone with any information to call 509-427-9490.
