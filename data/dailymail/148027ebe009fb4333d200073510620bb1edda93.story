A shooting rampage by a Fort Hood soldier has left four people dead and one wounded in the nearby town of Killeen. 

Police believe Atase Griffa shot dead his neighbors after his wife Dawn, 28, fled to their house on Sunday. He then dragged Dawn back to his own home and killed her and himself, authorities say. 

Giffa, who had a recent history of domestic quarrels with his wife Dawn, 28, went to a neighbor's home, opened fire, then forced her to return home with him, police spokeswoman Carroll Smith said.

'He shot a couple of people, took her, forced her back to the residence, then shot her and shot himself,' Smith said.

Sad: Police suspect that Dawn Giffa, 28, was fatally shot by her husband, Fort Hood soldier Atase Giffa, on Sunday

Police located Lydia Farina, 31, and Larry Guzman, 40, slain at Farina's home. A third victim, a 41-year-old woman, in that home was injured and remained in serious condition Tuesday. 

Her name was not released.

Police discovered the bodies of Giffa, 30, and his wife at their own home nearby.

Officers recently had been at the Giffa house for a domestic disturbance, according to Smith. She had no immediate details on the prior call.

Fort Hood officials issued a statement Tuesday saying Atase Giffa was from Clarkston, Georgia, and enlisted in 2009 as an automated logistics specialist. 

He and Dawn Giffa, who was from Kingston, Ontario, met while he was stationed at Fort Drum, New York, according to the Watertown, New York, Daily Times.

History of disturbances: Officers recently had been at the Giffa house for a domestic disturbance. She had no immediate details on the prior call.

Fort Hood officials issued a statement Tuesday saying Atase Giffa was from Clarkston, Georgia, and enlisted in 2009 as an automated logistics specialist.

Police responded to a 911 call about a disturbance just before 10.30pm on Sunday night and found Guzman, Farina and the third victim at a home. 

A witness informed officers the Giffas had been at the house and then went to their home two doors down.

The Killeen Police Department said: 'Shortly thereafter shots were heard coming from inside that residence. 

'The Tactical Response Unit [TRU] was deployed to the scene and several attempts were made to speak with the male however they received no response. 

'The TRU Officers made entry into the house at 12:26am and located the male and female deceased with gunshot wounds.' 

The Giffas have a son, Keoni, who is three years old, according to CKWS.

They met while Atase Giffa was stationed at Fort Drum near Watertown, New York, and moved to Texas about a year ago. 

Dawn Giffa, whose maiden name is Larson, is originally from Canada.

Her father is traveling to identify her body and get his grandson.

The Giffas have a son, Keoni, who is three years old. He will be going to Canada to live with his grandparents 

A GoFundMe page has been created to help the family. 

A woman who apparently knows the Larson family wrote: 'I just wanted to add that Donnie will be bringing his grandson home to Kingston soon, and Keoni will be very shocked and confused by this big change in his life. 

'Anyone who wants to donate items to make his transition easier can drop them off at the Mansion, or our home, and i'll make sure Donny Larson and his daughter Cierra receive them. 

'He is only three years old, so toys, children's books, furniture for his new room, a snow suit, winter boots and size three/four boys clothing will help him feel welcome and comfortable.'

Fort Hood did not immediately release Atase Giffa's rank and unit, the Killeen Daily Herald reported. 

A neighbor who asked not to be identified said: 

'We could hear women crying and screaming,' 

'It was unreal. Horrible. 

'It was something I'll never forget.'

Another neighbor described the situation as 'a complete tragedy'.  

The deadly shooting  was the second murder-suicide this year in Killeen.
