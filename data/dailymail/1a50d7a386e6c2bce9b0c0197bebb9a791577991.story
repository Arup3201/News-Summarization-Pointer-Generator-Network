New footage claims to show Mexican smugglers known as coyotes smuggling immigrants across the U.S. – Mexico border using jet skis.

A video shown on the Breitbart website claims the person driving the jet ski is a smuggler, and that his passengers are a woman and her infant child. It then shows the pair being taken into custody by Border Patrol.

The woman departs the jet ski and walks along the river bank to a nearby road where authorities apprehend her and the baby.

MailOnline was not able to independently confirm the nationality of the woman and infant. 

The video is said by Breitbart to have been shot recently at Anzalduas Park, in Mission, Texas. 

A downstream dam in the Rio Grande has created a lake of sorts that allows the coyotes to quickly zip across the river with immigrants, according to the site.

‘We have problems, a lot of times they (the coyotes) have more intel sources than we do,’ Border Patrol agent Albert Spratte is shown saying on the video. ‘Our resources have been hampered.’

Families shown on the riverbank pretending to fish often spend entire afternoons on cell phones telling smugglers of Border patrol movements, according to Spratte.

The jet skiing coyotes are only adding to the problem of undocumented immigrants overcrowding border holding cells.

‘Our station can hold like 300 people [but] we’ve actually held up to 1,300,’ Spratte continued.

Multiple messages left with the Border Patrol and the National Border Patrol Council seeking further comment and attempting to verify the information in the Breitbart report were not immediately returned.
