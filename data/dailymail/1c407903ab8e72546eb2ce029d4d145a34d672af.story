A Pennsylvania mother and nurse could face jail time for carrying out an at-home abortion on her teen daughter, which sent the 16-year-old to the hospital.

Jennifer Whlaen, 38, covered her face as she appeared in court earlier this month to face charges of illegally purchasing a $45 abortion kit from an overseas pharmacy when her daughter experienced an unwanted pregnancy in January 2012.

Whalen says she purchased the kit because she couldn't find a local abortion clinic and didn't want to travel out of state.

Two weeks after administering misoprostol and mifepristone, Whalen rushed her daughter to the Geisinger Medical Center when she began bleeding and thought something was 'really wrong'.

Medical records show that Whalen's daughter was treated for an 'incomplete abortion and a urinary tract infection' on February 6, 2012.

The trip to the hospital alerted authorities to the DIY abortion, but it wasn't until two years later that Whalen was formally charged.

The District Attorney explained the delayed charges saying the case 'was unusual and investigators had to research the drugs involved and other elements of the situation'.

The combination of drugs has been used by women in parts of Latin American and Africa where surgical abortions are harder to come by, according to Slate.

According to Pennsylvania law, abortion drugs require a prescription, something Whalen says she didn't know about. Abortions there must also be carried out under the care of a doctor.

Whalen says she is nurse, but doesn't have a nursing license. An article from last December reported that she worked at a nursing home.

She is now facing a felony count of medical consultation and judgement in addition to misdemeanor charges of not being licensed as a pharmacist, endangering the welfare of a child and simple assault. 

Since one of the counts is a felony, it is possible that Whalen could face prison time.

During her first court appearance, Whalen waived her right to a preliminary hearing. She has been free on$25,000 bail and her arraignment has been set for March. Her daughter is now 18.
