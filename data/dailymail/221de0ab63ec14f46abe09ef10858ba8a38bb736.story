He has quick-fire  skills any NBA player would be proud of.

Rivals can only watch in awe as this gentleman shows the younger players his slick shooting at an amusement arcade in Taiwan.

Shooting hoops: Arcade player has shooting skills any NBA player would be proud of. Reaches remarkable score by firing up to three balls a second

Dressed in a stripey polo shirt and khaki shorts, he seems an unlikely basketball star.

But his fluid strokes - averaging between two and three a second while - take his score off the chart.

Using alternate arms for maximum speed, the machine struggles to keep up with his tally during the minute-long video. 

The middle-aged man doesn't miss, only pausing briefly to let the build up of balls subside.

Slick skills: Man achieves incredible score by firing shots with both hands. His opponents cannot keep up in arcade in Taiwan.

Maxing out at 491, his incredible score shows up his t-shirt clad opponent, who shoots a paltry 96 by comparison.

While the sharp shooter waits for his fellow players to catch up, he even starts firing balls at the next door machine, scoring off the side and in.

Cool customer: The man retrieves a hanky from his pocket to wipe his brow after incredible feat on arcade machine. His rival can only look on as the middle-aged man scores 491

Wow: Rival amazed by performance of fellow hoop shooter stops in awe. The middle-aged man shot between two and three balls a second, never missing

Looking a little bored, he casually wipes his brow, grabs a bag and then leaves, much to the bemusement of the guy next to him who stops in astonishment.
