These captivating images of a breathtaking seaside villa may look like they're computer generated, but they are pure unadulterated architectural reality.

Nestled in Cape Town's cliff-side, the work of architectural art by South African design duo Greg Truen and Stefan Antoni of SAOTA has a 'seamless flow' between the natural beauty outside and the stunning modern interior.

With its jaw-dropping architecture, 
including a triple volume gallery in the main living area, uninterrupted
 sea and mountain views and utterly lust-worthy interiors, it's no 
wonder the property has caught the attention of interior fans around the
 globe, including MailOnline's property blogger Celia Sawyer.

The incredible villa has a split-level living area, a three-story high gallery and 270 degree views of the Atlantic Ocean and beyond

'Many of my clients own superb beach houses or water-front apartments, but this residential home is something of a marvel,' she says of the house, which has panoramic views of Cape 
Town's iconic Clifton Beaches, some the world's most beautiful, and the 
calming waves of the Atlantic Ocean. 

'I love the triple volume gallery space they have created inside and praise how the master bedroom floats over into the double volume living space with a striking soft s-curve cantilever.'

'To the rear of the site you can sit and 
enjoy the mountains. This level enjoys 270 degree views from Lion’s Head
 at the rear to the Bantry Bay ridge on the North and the dramatic sea 
views over the Clifton beaches to the West,' she adds.

The garden is designed to be protected from infamous Cape Town wind, but still has incredible views of the dramatic landscape

'On speaking to the architects they told me how the brief was to create a building that maximised the connection with the view and the sea, create a garden on the mountain side of the site and to minimise views over neighbouring buildings.

'I know their team has done this perfectly! The pictures say it all,' she says. For more of Celia's favourite extravagant houses, go to her new blog Posh Property.

As well as breathtaking architecture, the 1,624 metre square villa is furnished to perfection by Cape Town-based interior designer studio OKHA.

‘The building provides a volumetrically 
dramatic and dynamic interior space on a grand scale,' says OKHA designer Adam Court. 'The objective of 
the interior décor was to create a softer and intimate counterpoint 
whilst not jeopardizing the clean, geometric lines of the architecture.

'These elements can harmoniously co-exist and work off each other,’

'By utilising a broad base of 
textures and finishes, the décor feels natural and subtly organic, 
comfort being of paramount importance at all times; the overall ambiance
 is one of calm and serenity.

'Colour is kept to a bare minimum, the 
interior works predominantly with a light and shade tonal range, 
allowing the exterior views, the mountain, the ocean and sky and also 
the artwork to bring in colour.'

With floor-to-ceiling windows from wall-to-wall, it's not a bad spot to watch the sunset

From every angle the cliff-side property takes in the lush surroundings - mountains, gardens, beaches and sea

In the foyer of the mansion there's a glass elevator and a sweeping staircase, which take you to the airy living space.

And of course, there's a separate staff entrance too for butler, gardener, housekeeper, cook and anyone else you might want to invite along to make life a little easier.

There’s also an entire open level that can be used as a gym or games room as well as an elegant cinema room for private screenings.

And of course you won't be feuding with your neighbours over parking spots. The sheltered garage can accommodate up to four large vehicles -- or even a small boat!

The dining area at the back leads out into the garden and the lounge area at the front opens out onto a sea-view terrace
