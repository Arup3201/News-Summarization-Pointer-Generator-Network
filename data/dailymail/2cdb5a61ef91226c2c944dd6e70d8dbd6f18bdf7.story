Mitt Romney has gaffed again after ruining a wedding by turning up at the venue and stealing the limelight.

The Republican presidential candidate made the blunder whilst attending a fundraiser in New Jersey at the same venue where an Orthodox Jewish wedding was taking place.

The moment Romney pulled up in his motorcade the bride and groom’s family ‘abandoned’ them and ran towards him.

The happy couple were left standing around as 10 of their loved ones desperately tried to take a photo of the candidate.

Mr Romney erred having arrived early at Lake Terrace in Lakewood, New Jersey a hall that served the local Jewish population.

According to a Yahoo news reporter who was following him on the campaign trail, the wedding family ‘abandoned the bride and groom and began chasing Romney’s car in the parking lot, waving cameras’.

When they found themselves at the back entrance to the hall they were stopped by members of the Secret Service and told them: ‘We just want to see Romney’.

Error: It is the latest in a series of gaffes by the former Massachusetts governor

Romney later tried to make amends by posing for his own picture with the bride and groom, his spokesman said.

The error is the latest in a series of gaffes by the former Massachusetts governor.

Earlier this week he confused ‘Sikh’ and ‘Sheikh’ whilst talking about the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple.

Sheik is a Muslim term for the leader of a village or tribe.

On his recent foreign tour, his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate, Romney was branded ‘Mitt the Twit’ and ‘Party Pooper’ by British newspapers for suggesting the London Games would be a failure.

Romney, who has been credited with rescuing the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, was attacked by David Cameron who said it was unfair to compare having the event in London with hosting it in a city which is ‘in the middle of nowhere’.

Romney also had to play down comments by one of his advisors that he understood the relationship between the US and the UK better than President Obama because he appreciated its shared ‘Anglo Saxon heritage’.

During a subsequent stop in Israel Romney was condemned as ‘racist’ by Palestinians for suggesting that Israel was succeeding in comparison to its Arab neighbours due to the ‘hand of providence’.
