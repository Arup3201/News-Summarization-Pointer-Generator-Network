This week, eyebrows were raised in astonishment at the transformation of Taylor Swift's errr... eyebrows. 

The pop star was remodeled for her photo shoot with Wonderland magazine and given a set of bows large enough to rival Cara Delevingne. 

The chunky caterpillars completely revamped Taylor's face, turning her from pretty princess into edgy model. 

Taylor isn't the only star dipping her toe in the bushy brow pool though. 

The Duchess of Cambridge, Megan Fox, Kate Moss and Gwen Stefani have added considerable size to theirs since the days of skinny eyebrows in the late nineties and early noughties.  

Taylor was transformed by bushy eyebrows on a magazine cover. She follows stars like Mila Kuni and Coleen Rooney. A larger brow makes a look more polished and glamorous, while a skinny brow has an ageing effect 

The celebrity trend has led to the growth of professional brow grooming services  at an astonishing rate over the last decade.

Women are paying a small fortune to return their eyebrows to their original state. 

A larger brow makes a look more polished and glamorous, whereas a skinny brow has an ageing effect on the features. 

Nilam Patel, founder of HD Brows - who is often referred to as 'The Eyebrow Queen' - said: 'Cara has truly put brows on the beauty and fashion agenda and for that we can all be grateful.'

She continued: 'Be patient and grow in brows. 

'In the meantime – fake it until you make it! 

'I feel options such as good permanent make up and temporary brow extensions are great for people wanting realistic brows when there isn't any hair there. 

'There is also so much that can be done with make up to make brows look better.

'If your brows need a boost try a Lash & Brow Booster - it's great for promoting growth of sparse or over-plucked brows.' 

Gwen Stefani had the ultimate skinny brows in the 90s, but at the Emmys last August they were triple the size 

Lily Cole has always had busy brows (pictured left in 2005), but the supermodel has now gone for the darker look 

The Duchess of Cambridge has trademark bushy brows, but back in 2005 (left), they were considerably slimmer 

Megan Fox is almost unrecognisable with a slimmer brow back in 2004 (left), compared to last month at a film premiere for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 

Lindsay Lohan never completely over-plucked, but even she has gone to some lengths to make her brows bushier 

Mila Kunis is proud of her dark features, but it didn't stop her getting carried away with the tweezers in 2001. She has since grown her brows back to their full capacity 

Coleen Rooney is queen of the Scouse brow, but even the WAG went for a slimline look back in 2005 

Keira Knightley has always been proud of her big brows - even back in 2003 (left), but the actress has gone super-sized in recent years  

Katy Perry has upped the effort all round since 2006 (left), nowadays the pop star sports bushy brows as well as a glamorous make-up finish 

Kate Moss was the queen of the skinny brow back in 1993, but the supermodel has attempted to claw back some of the volume now
