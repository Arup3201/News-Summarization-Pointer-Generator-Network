Experts have warned that governments are ill-prepared for a rise in 'injury and possible deaths'

The world's first 'online murder' could occur by the end of this year, as cyber criminals exploit internet technology to target potential victims.

Experts have warned that governments are ill-prepared to combat a rise in 'injury and possible deaths' caused by computer attacks on critical safety equipment.

A Europol threat assessment  cited a report by US security firm IID that predicted the first murder via 'hacked internet-connected device' by the end of 2014.

It said that police forensic techniques need to 'adapt and grow' to address the dangers posed by the  'Internet of Everything', The Independent reports.

This refers to a new era of technological connectedness, in which everything from garage doors to hospital health systems will be linked and controlled through computer networks.

'There's already this huge quasi-underground market where you can buy and sell vulnerabilities that have been discovered,' said Rod Rasmussen, the president of IID. 

He added that while the first reported murder was yet to happen, 'death by internet' was already a reality from online extortion and blackmail that has led to suicide. 

If his firm's prediction of an online murder did not occur by the end of 2014, Mr Rasmussen said it was bound to happen within the next few years.

'The IoE [Internet of Everything] represents a whole new attack vector that we believe criminals will already be looking for ways to exploit,'  the Europol threat assessment stated.

'The IoE is inevitable. We must expect a rapidly growing number of devices to be rendered 'smart' and thence to become interconnected. 

'Unfortunately, we feel that it is equally inevitable that many of these devices will leave vulnerabilities via which access to networks can be gained by criminals.'

There have not yet been any proven cases of murder by tampering with devices, but hackers have highlighted numerous flaws in computer security systems.

The former US vice-president Dick Cheney revealed last year that the wireless function had been disabled on his implanted defibrillator because of concerns of sabotage.

Elite hacker Barnaby Jack spectacularly demonstrated his ability to cause ATMs to spit out cash and was days away from demonstrating how pacemakers could be hacked when he died from a drug overdose last year

Cheney, who has a long history of heart problems, said doctors made the move over fears that outsiders could hack the network and provoke a heart attack.

The politician said that a few years later he watched an episode of US thriller Homeland, starring Claire Danes and British actor Damian Lewis, in which someone’s pacemaker was hacked to provoke a heart attack.

He told CBS: 'I was aware of the danger, if you will, that existed, but I found it credible.

'Because I know from the experience we had and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.'

The Europol report also suggested that we could see new forms of extortion and blackmail through connected devices in the years ahead. 

This could include hackers and online criminals locking people out of their smart cars and homes until a ransom had been paid.

'Someone could unlock your [smart] home and get in to cause harm,' Craig Spiezle, of the Online Trust Alliance, a US-based privacy and security organisation, told The Independent.

With new technology 'there's always someone in the background to exploit it', he said.
