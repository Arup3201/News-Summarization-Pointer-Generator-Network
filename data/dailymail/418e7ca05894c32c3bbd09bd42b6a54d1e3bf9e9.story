Cardinal George Pell has compared the Catholic Church's responsibility for child sexual abuse to that of a trucking company if one of the drivers committed an offense.

The senior church member made the comparison while appearing at the royal commission via video link from the Vatican in Rome on Thursday night.

'If a driver sexually assaulted a passenger they picked up along the way I don't think it appropriate for the ... leadership of that company be held responsible,' he said.

Victim Paul Hersback's lawyer, Sean Cash, said the the trucking company analogy doesn't stand up because the Catholic Church is meant to be an organisation of the 'highest integrity'.

'If every precaution has been taken, no warning has been given, it is, I think, not appropriate for legal culpability to be foisted on the authority figure.

'If in fact the authority figure has been remiss through bad preparation, bad procedures or been warned and done nothing or insufficient, then certainly the church official would be responsible,' the cardinal reasoned.

Cardinal Pell defended the Melbourne Response, which he established when he was Archbishop of the Melbourne Archdiocese in 1996.

Under the scheme a free counselling and support service known as Carelink was created and compensation was also available.

But if victims reported their abuse to the police they were no longer eligible for compensation.

'We were among the front-runners in Melbourne in addressing these scandals and I would suggest to you that that is entirely consistent with Catholic tradition and the teachings of Christ,' Cardinal Pell said.

Cardinal Pell did however apologise to parents Christine and Anthony Foster, whose children Emma and Katie were sexually abused by Father Kevin O'Donnell.

When the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a Royal Commission in late 2012 into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, Cardinal Pell also caused controversy when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession.

'If that is done outside the confessional (it can be reported to the police).... (But) the Seal of Confession is inviolable. If the priest knows beforehand about such a situation, the priest should refuse to hear the confession... That would be my advice, and I would never hear the confession of a priest who is suspected of such a thing,' he said.

On Thursday the Vatican also refused to hand over the files of Australian priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission.

The Vatican said the commission's request for documents on each allegation involving an Australian cleric was 'neither possible nor appropriate'.

Reasons included ongoing church investigations, and that internal working documents were the sovereign property of the Holy See.

Cardinal Pell, now working in Rome, was asked if he sought an assurance from the Vatican that any document the royal commission needed would be provided.

'That is correct,' Cardinal Pell told the commission.

'I suppose in retrospect there would be some discussion over what any document' meant.

'Cardinal Pell said specific requests about cases would be more likely to succeed than what he described as an 'ambit claim' for large numbers of documents.

A letter from the royal commission to the Vatican said it needed access to documents if it was to fulfil its terms of references.

'It is essential that the royal commission understand the nature and extent of the communications between those congregations and the Holy See in relation to child sexual abuse complaints about Australian clerics,' the letter said.

Cardinal Pell said the Vatican had provided 5000 pages of documents in relation to specific requests.

'But in following international convention they will not provide internal working documents of another sovereign state,' he said.

Cardinal Pell said he thought the royal commission's request for documents relating to each case was 'unreasonable'.

'Overwhelmingly every document that is held in Rome exists here ... I am not aware of exceptions - overwhelmingly they are available in Australia,' he said.

A letter from the Vatican's Secretariat of State said finding every file on accused Australian priests would be a substantial burden, 'inconsistent with international practice'.
