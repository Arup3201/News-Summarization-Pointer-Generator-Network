A special needs teacher admitted in court that she had sex with a 17-year-old boy when he was her student.

Kelly McKenzy Watson, 34, met the 17-year-old while she was his teacher at the residential New Haven Youth and Family Services in Vista, Los Angeles. The establishment works with emotionally disturbed boys.

She was employed there from September 2010 to August 2011, before transferring to teach at Oceanside High School in California.
