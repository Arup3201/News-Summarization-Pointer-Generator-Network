Leila Johnston, 33, spent her childhood in Gourock, Inverclyde, playing with IBM components

When Leila Johnston was growing up she knew she was different from her friends.

While their bedroom walls were plastered with the latest popstars, hers was covered with a giant picture of the nearby IBM building.

While they played with dolls and Lego, she played with IBM computer components brought home from the nearby Inverclyde plant by friends and family.

Yes, Leila, 33, is a self-confessed IBM addict. And proud.

Her obsession with the American technology company is such that she has spent the last year tracking down IBM tills in shops, cafes and pharmacists and posting them online.

She was even given the chance to bring her strange obsession to a live audience when she was asked to speak at the annual Boring Festival in London earlier this month.

She opened her address with: 'I know I’ll never be able to get them all, but I’ve found I can’t stop.

'It’s as though the logo sings out to me. IBM tills are a beacon of 
research and intelligence hidden in the plain sight of consumerism'

When she spots an IBM till she takes a picture, plots its location and uploads it to her blog, for other IBM fanatics out there who appreciate the technology's beauty.

Leila is quite aware of the randomness of her hobby, but defends it to the hilt.

'It sounds… unusual, I realise, but I 
believe it’s no stranger than bird watching or trainspotting. I’ve 
found an elusive thin-client series 300 and the almost-unheard-of series
700.'

For those reading this and interested in 
joining Leila in capturing on camera IBM tills across Britain, it's not as simple as it sounds.

On her blog she lists 'The Golden Rules of IBM Spotting' ('because the public can’t really be relied upon for these kinds of projects, I came up with some rules') she outlines the process to which 'spotters' must adhere.

'IBM logo must be clearly visible in the photo and you must photograph exactly as you find it. Do not interfere with the scene', she writes.

If an IBM spotter ever has the rare fortune of stumbling across more than one piece of IBM equipment in the one shot, they are advised 'to email me immediately' because 'it's quite rare to find a full set in the wild', she says.

Leila, who now lives in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, added: 'I think it’d be unhealthy to take it too seriously, but the history of IBM is genuinely interesting, and as a company they are as worthy of our interest as Apple or Microsoft. But they have become invisible over the years.

'They are no longer associated with great technical achievement when I think they really ought to be. They invented the first PC after all.'

Amazingly, the 45 photos she posted on her finalbullet.com blog have attracted thousands of visitors from all over the world.
