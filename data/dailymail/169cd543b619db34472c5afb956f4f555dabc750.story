Plans for TV debates ahead of next year’s General Election are in chaos, with growing doubts over whether they will take place. 

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been offered a slot in one of the debates under plans unveiled by broadcasters yesterday. 

One debate would be be a straight fight between Tory David Cameron and Labour's Ed Miliband, a second debate will also feature Lib Dem Nick Clegg, but in the third Mr Farage will also join the line-up.

But the plans were immediately plunged into chaos amid threats of legal action, with the Lib Dems opposing any attempt to exclude Mr Clegg, Ukip suggesting Mr Farage should be included in more than one and the Greens and Respect demanding a place.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have been urged to sign up to the debates but there remain doubts about the details

More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time political leaders had gone head-to-head in Britain.

The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics said they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign.

The decision to offer Mr Farage a place in one of the debates is likely to prove controversial, but the broadcasters said they are 'responding to the changes in the political landscape'.

Ukip won its first elected MP - Douglas Carswell - in last week's Clacton by-election and aims to secure a second seat in Rochester and Strood.

One opinion poll yesterday put Ukip on 25 per cent, just behind Labour and the Tories tied on 31 per cent. In theory, this level of support could give Ukip 128 MPs. 

Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News will host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman.

This is likely to appeal to the Conservatives, who want to present the next election as a straight choice over who should be the next Prime Minister.

Polls suggest fewer than one in five voters think Mr Miliband should be PM.

Mr Cameron said: 'I will have a look at this proposal. I think there are some questions over it.

'Why have all the debates inside the election campaign, rather than spreading them out over a longer period? And also, why include some parties and not other parties?'

Mr Cameron suggested that he would only be willing to take part in a debate against Mr Farage if other minor parties are included, such as the Greens. 'I'm in favour of TV debates, but you've got to make sure you come up with a proposal that everyone can agree to, and I can't see how you can have one party in that has an MP in Parliament, and not another party.

'I'm sure clever people can get together and sort these issues out, but they do need to take these sorts of points into account.'

The PM also repeated his suggestion that any debate should begin before the official election period, to avoid overshadowing the rest of the campaign.

Mr Farage welcomed the offer, but suggested that he should be included in more than one debate

The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010.

ITV will host a four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time. It would hosted by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham.

John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: 'There are only 24 weeks to go before the start of the General Election Campaign.

'Sky, Channel Four, the BBC and ITV have put together a clear compelling proposal; three debates during the election campaign. It's now critical that the political parties engage and start negotiating for the debates seriously.'

The 2010 general election saw Britain's first live TV debates between the main party leaders, with Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown going head-to-head with Tory leader Mr Cameron and the Lib Dems' Mr Clegg.

More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time party leaders had gone head-to-head in a general election campaign

As the least known leader at the three, Mr Clegg was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates, with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels.

Senior figures in the Conservative party fear allowing Ukip to take part could see Mr Farage benefit in the same way, depriving them of an overall majority in what is certain to be another close election.

Mr Clegg has previously accused the Tories of refusing to sign up to the debates because of concern about giving Ukip a publicity boost.

The Lib Dems welcomed moves to ensure the debates happened again, but opposed any attempt to exclude Mr Clegg.

A spokesman said: 'The Liberal Democrats, like the Labour Party, have publicly said that we would be prepared to sign up to the same 3-3-3 system we had in 2010.

'We do not accept the proposal that the Liberal Democrats, as a party of government, should be prevented from defending our record in one of the TV debates.

'That is the case we will make strongly in the negotiations that will now take place and we urge the other parties to join us around the negotiating table without excuse or delay.'

A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'We note the request and will respond accordingly.' 

Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP

Mr Miliband welcomed the proposals as a 'positive step forward' . He added: 'I hope David Cameron is not going to put up false obstacles to these TV debates happening.

'He should be saying they will happen, they must happen during the campaign. For my part, I'm going to make sure they do.'

He added: 'I think they are a good basis for moving forward. I think the most important thing is to give the public what they are entitled to, which is these TV debates.

'They happened at the last general election, we must make sure they happen in this general election too.'

Both the Green party and Respect - which like Ukip have each an one MP - demanded to be included alongside Mr Farage.

Mr Cameron questioned how it would be possible to include one party with a single MP – Ukip – but exclude the Greens and Respect, who also each have one member of the Commons.

‘I will have a look at this proposal. I think there are some questions over it,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘Why have all the debates inside the election campaign, rather than spreading them out over a longer period? And also, why include some parties and not other parties?’

Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood added: ‘The people of Wales deserve nothing less than to hear what all parties have to offer them and we will be taking immediate steps to ensure that this happens.’ Only Mr Miliband welcomed the proposals as a ‘positive step forward’.

‘I hope David Cameron is not going to put up false obstacles to these TV debates happening,’ he said.

Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for democratic reform, criticised broadcasters for seeking to exclude smaller parties.

She said: ‘The format suggested by the broadcasters doesn’t really reflect the fact that we are now firmly in a multi-party era.’

Respect MP George Galloway threatened legal action to be included in the debates, along with Green party MP Caroline Lucas

Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said: 'With these proposals the broadcasters are demonstrating just how out of touch they are with the public mood, and how ridiculously they cling to the idea that the future of politics looks like the past.

'It is clear from votes and polls that the public are fed up with the three business-as-usual parties and are looking around for alternatives.

'That is also demonstrated by the soaring membership of the Green parties of England and Wales and Scotland, now exceeding 27,000.

'Those members, the fast-growing numbers of likely Green voters (matching Lib Dems numbers), and the majority who back Green policies like bringing the railways back into public hands and the living wage for all workers would be seriously short-changed by debates from which we were excluded.'

Respect MP George Galloway later wrote on Twitter: 'I am ready to join Caroline Lucas MP in a legal challenge against our exclusion from the leaders debates in the forthcoming general election.'
