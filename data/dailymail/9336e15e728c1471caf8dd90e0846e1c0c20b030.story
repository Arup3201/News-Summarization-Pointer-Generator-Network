Kristin Hallenga was 23 years old when she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. Just seven days later, medics told her the disease had spread to her spine.

Her devastating diagnosis came almost 12 months after she first found a lump in her breast.

'It was really quite horrendous. I cannot put in to words how I felt,' Kris said this week. 'Stage four, advance – whatever you call it you know you are f****d.'

After several rounds of chemotherapy, Kris, who will never be cancer-free and receives monthly treatment in hospital, is one of the most prolific cancer campaigners in the country thanks to her charity CoppaFeel!.

Kristin Hallenga who, at 23, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and just one week later, she learned it had spread to her spine. Her diagnosis came 12 months after she first felt a lump in her breast

The organisation, known for its attention-grabbing campaigns and flash mobs, encourages young people to regularly check their breasts for lumps and other signs of cancer.

Since its launch in 2009, CoppaFeel! has gone from strength to strength. As well as launching the Rethink Cancer campaign - which calls for schoolpupils to be educated about the signs and risks of the disease - Kris's remarkable story was recently featured in a BBC 3 documentary.

Last month, CoppaFeel! was again in the media following the launch of the Check 'Em Tuesday campaign - which gained vast celebrity backing.

Now the organisation are putting all their efforts in to the so-called bra hijack - which calls for lingerie manufacturers to sew labels into bras reminding women to check their breasts.

Despite admitting her slow diagnosis made her 'lose faith in the medical system,' Kris, now 28, says her cancer changed her life in a positive way.

Today, Kris reflected on her extraordinary achievements saying: 'I don’t like to use or talk about the 
word terminal. You could say everyone’s life is terminal.

'But I am living 
with something that is likely to kill me.

'I just hope I would have been as happy without cancer as I am with it - however odd that sounds.

'Before there was no plan - I was ambitious, but not one of these people who wanted to achieve great things.

'I am very proud of what we have done with CoppaFeel! And I am extremely happy with what I have done in my life.'

It was in early 2008 that Kris found a lump in her breast while on holiday in Barcelona with her mother, Jane, and sister Maren.

On her return home, she went to her GP - who told her not to worry and the lump was most likely hormonal, or linked to her contraceptive pill.

According to the ONS, breast cancer 
is the most common form of cancer in England - accounting for 31 per 
cent of all newly diagnosed cases.

The
 disease broadly falls into two groups. The first is non-invasive breast
 cancer, which is found in the ducts of the breast and does not spread 
outside the breast.

The
 second is invasive cancer, which can spread outside the breast. It is 
the most common and it accounted for almost 90 per cent of new breast 
cancer registrations in 2011.

According to Cancer Research UK, in 2010, 49,564 women and 397 men in the UK were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.

In 2011, there were 11,684 female and 78 male deaths from invasive breast cancer in the UK.

Between 2005-2009, 85.1 per cent of adult female breast cancer patients in England survived their cancer for five years or more.

In 2010, 5,765 women and 26 men in the UK were diagnosed with in situ breast carcinoma.

According to Coppafeel! women under the age of 30 are more likely to go to the opticians than check their breasts.

1 in 8 women are affected by cancer in the UK.

Kris said: 'When I went to the GP, I didn’t really want her to say anything. I was about to go traveling to China.

'If I am honest, I had felt the lump 
before then. I don’t know how long before. I did not think anything bad 
of it. I thought it would go away.'

Kris then went to China for six months and, on her return, went back to a doctor - this time with acute pain in her breast.

He suggested she come off her contraceptive pill - and sent her away again. But her mother told her to ask for a referral to a breast clinic.

Three weeks later, Kris was finally seen by a specialist. By this time, she had woken up in the morning with a blood-stained t-shirt.

'That was terrifying,' she said. 'I was staying at a friends when it happened and her mother is a nurse.

'She didn't want to say anything at the time, but she has said since how worried she was for me.

'It wasn't the first time I had discharged blood, either. But I still did not think it was cancer. You just don't think it will happen to you.'

Finally, after several painful scans including an excruciating mammogram, a cancerous lump the size of an avocado was found in her breast - almost a year after she first went to her doctors.

'I cringe about it.,' Kris said, 'I think back and cringe about not seeing or acknowledging the signs.

'I do not want to blame myself though. It was lack of awareness. I did not think it would happen to me.'

A medic who noticed Kris had pain in her back during one of her scans suggested she was tested for cancer in her spine.

Kris added: 'I had been having pain in my back for a while - which I blamed on a skiing injury. I just knew deep down that it was cancer in my bones.'

Seven days later, her fears were confirmed.

It was during her first round of chemo that, feeling frustrated at the lack of help and support for younger cancer sufferers, she and Maren set up CoppaFeel! - which she says will continue to help people for many years to come.

CoppaFeel!'s next move is to start targeting schools - training teachers to educate young people about their bodies and to get in to the habit of checking themselves at a young age.

One of the charity's numerous fun, attention grabbing campaigns saw scores of women dressed as breasts taking to the London underground

To this end, they have launched 
Rethink Cancer. Through the campaign, the charity are asking for student
 teachers to be trained how to teach young people to look after their 
health and that all secondary school students have time set aside in the
 curriculum to learn about health issues.

They ask that people write to their teachers or MPs demanding this is installed into secondary schools.

'That is the big one,' Kris said, 'I will die a very happy woman if we achieve that one.'

The charity this week launched their #BraHijack campaign -  appealing to the lingerie world to introduce a small label reminding women to check themselves in bras sold in the UK.

CoppaFeel! has recently featured in the media following the start of the Check 'Em Tuesday campaign with The Sun newspaper.

 Cervical cancer is the most common 
cancer among women aged 15–34. It is accountable for 16 per cent of all 
cancers diagnosed in this age group (ONS).

In the UK between 2009 and 2011, an 
average of 181 and 130 cancer deaths per year occurred in males and 
females aged 15-24 years, respectively. 

Cancer
 is the most common cause of death in young women (15 per cent) and the 
fourth most common in young men (9 per cent), according to Cancer 
Research.

However, less than one per cent of the total cancer deaths occur in 15-24 year olds.

The scheme attracted a certain amount of controversy by anti page 3 campaigners who saw it as the newspaper's way of advocating topless modelling while cancer charities argued it trivialised the disease.

One charity Breast Cancer Care, said using Page Three would be seen as 'ill-judged and insensitive' by patients or relatives.

Prolific campaign group No More Page Three furthermore questioned why it was necessary to use 'sexualised' topless images to promote health messages.

In response, Kris said: ‘It has been 80 
per cent positive.

'A lot of people are upset by it. But in order to get 
our message across we have to do things that may upset some people.'

As her work continues to go from strength to strength, Kris added that,as much as she loves her work, she will always put her health first.

'Obviously it wouldn't exist without it, but I have never really used my illness to promote the charity.

'Everyone has down days. 90 per cent of the time I am feeling well.

'I do not want people to treat me any different. But sometimes people should respect that I am trying to deal with my health.

'I do not want to do this because I am dying. I want to do this because I am living.'
