It didn’t take long for Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett to address his team’s biggest question mark heading into Sunday’s showdown at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Will Tony Romo play? Garrett didn’t answer that question specifically, but as a Magic 8-Ball might suggest: the signs point to yes.

‘We anticipate Tony being able to practice today. Hopefully he’ll be able to have a full practice,’ Garrett said on Thursday at Allianz Park.

‘We’ll see. Hopefully he’s able to do what we want him to do during a Thursday practice and as the week goes on he’ll feel good with the work he’s gotten and be able to play in the ball game.’

The 34-year-old missed last week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals because of a back injury he sustained in Week 8 against the Washington Redskins. Backup Brandon Weeden was abysmal filling in against the Cardinals in Week 9 with two interceptions and only 18 completions for 183 yards.

Garrett and the rest of the Cowboys are eager to see how Romo’s back holds up on Thursday.

‘You want to have constant communication with all of your players, especially players who are dealing with injuries,’ said the 48-year-old coach. ‘Not to the point where it’s distracting, but you want honest feedback from guys who are coming back from injury so you can handle them the right way.’

‘We would never put a player in harm’s way. Obviously it’s a very physical sport we play and these guys are always putting themselves on the line, but the medical staff will clear the player regardless of who the player is. 

'We’ll make the right decision as a coaching staff on if that player is ready to play. He has to be functional and able to protect himself. We’d never put anybody in a bad situation.’

The Cowboys have spent the week training at the home of Saracens rugby club  

The Cowboys have lost two straight games and could badly use Romo back calling plays to help them secure a win heading into their bye week. 

However before Romo is put to the test at Wembley, Garrett said he must first get passing marks at Allianz Park. 

‘Every day is a test, every day we come out here it’s a competition, it’s a test,’ Garrett, a former quarterback himself, said. 

The Cowboys squad go through their paces ahead of their clash with Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley 

‘We’re finding out who’s ready, who’s getting themselves prepared. And certainly that applies to everybody on our team; that applies to the guys who are coming back from injury. We want to see Tony practice, if he’s not able to practice, we’ll put Brandon in. But hopefully he’ll get himself warmed up, ready to go and have a good day today for our team.’

Whether Romo is able to play on Sunday or not, Dallas’s game plan will remain relatively unchanged, although Garrett acknowledged that things would open up with his No. 1 quarterback back in the lineup.

‘Whoever is playing, they’re gonna have a responsibility to play the way we want to play,’ Garrett said.

‘We’ll tailor things to certain guys, but for the most part the game plan will be full regardless of who the quarterback is. There’s a responsibility for everyone to do their job and play well. When you do that, regardless of who’s playing next to you, that gives you the best chance to have success.’

No matter if it’s Romo or Weeden under centre, the Dallas offensive line will have their collective hands full making sure Jacksonville’s pass rush, which has already collected 27 sacks this season, is stymied.

‘Independent of what the quarterback’s health is, the Jacksonville pass rush is really good. They have guys that can rush and there’s a mentality to rush the passer. They’re very good as individual rushers,’ Garrett, who has a 35-30 record with the Cowboys, said.

‘They do a good job getting up the field and affecting the passing game. Regardless of what the health status is of your quarterback, you have to make sure you protect against these guys. It’s the offensive line’s job to make sure the quarterback isn’t affected and to keep the pocket clean.’

If all goes to plan, the line will be keeping the pocket clean for Romo, not Weeden.
