Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced by European judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament decides they should be barred from elections, David Cameron warned today.

In a strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, the Prime Minister called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings clipped.

The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights.

Defiant: David Cameron, who tweeted this picture, told workers at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees that Parliament should over-rule Strasbourg

Mr Cameron spoke out during a question and answer session at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees.

The ECHR has announced it is 
reopening 2,281 compensation claims by UK prisoners.

In February last year the Commons called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg.

Since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings.

Mr Cameron said: 'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn't.'

He added: "It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.'

The PM said the court's powers must be restricted, telling workers 'we need to clip its wings'.

Earlier this month Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption compared the behaviour of the Strasbourg court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist East Germany.

‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ he said.

But a week ago Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court and the most senior woman among the judiciary, said European judges did have the right to overrule Parliament on the issue.

She said Strasbourg human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because MPs will not do the job.

The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate.

Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions.

In 2010 Mr Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison.

And in October last year he added: 'No one should  be under any doubt - prisoners are not getting  the vote under this government.'
