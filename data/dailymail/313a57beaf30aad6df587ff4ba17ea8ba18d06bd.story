Nicky Hilton, designer, businesswoman and hotel heiress, has opened up exclusively to MailOnline about the details of her upcoming book, 365 Style, as we see the cover for the first time.

'One of the biggest misconceptions about style is that you need a huge bank account to have it', she reveals. 'I believe that no amount of money can buy you style. Having good style takes originality, imagination and confidence.'

And 365 Style isn't merely a mash-up of fashion tips, according to the 30-year-old beauty. Nicky has come up with a winning formula: 'My method suggests identifying six staple items of clothing and five essential accessories per season, my 3-6-5 approach; it’s proven to really be a fail-proof method for me and my friends.'

'365 Style is meant to be a go-to guide to keeping our closets in check', Nicky explains.

'My book offers a simple method that helps girls identify the staple pieces that work best for their lifestyle, encourages them to stay true to their own tastes, and most importantly shows them how to have fun with fashion every day of the year.'

You might think the younger sister of Paris Hilton - who has famously uttered the words: 'Once I've worn a dress, I can never wear it again' - would share a similar throw-away approach to fashion. Not so.

'I don’t believe in buying into every trend that hits the runway. Trends can be fun, but they don’t last forever', she says.

'When looking for pieces that really represent you, I’ve found it helpful to evaluate the three main aspects of your lifestyle and buy for those circumstances rather than the ‘what if’. Those items are rarely worn, if at all, they just clutter your closet space.'

A frequent fixture at the front row of worldwide fashion shows, and with two of her own lines behind her, fashion is clearly an art form Nicky holds close to her heart, so what does the term really to mean to her?

From night to day: 'I’ve found it helpful to evaluate the three main aspects of your lifestyle and buy for those circumstances rather than the ‘what if’', Nicky reveals

'Fashion for me is about expressing yourself, showing the outside world a glimpse of who you are on the inside', she explains.

'The book reaches beyond the superficial and really encourages girls to use fashion as a way of declaring and celebrating what they’re all about.’ 

'Writing 365 Style has been an exciting and challenging experience for me,' Nicky says. 'It has allowed me to reflect on my fashion and lifestyle choices throughout the years and has shown me how I have grown and evolved in my own style.'

Swoon: Nicky recently shared a picture on Instagram of herself gazing lovingly at her banker boyfriend, James Rothschild (pictured)

'I think a lot of girls and women will relate with the messages in the book', she continues. 'It’s a great opportunity for me to answer so many of the questions I get via social media and share so much more.

I can’t wait for people to read it and benefit from the tips I’ve learned along the way.'

Nicky, who is rumored to be talking marriage with her 29-year-old banker boyfriend, James Rothschild, is currently bouncing around the globe to promote 365 Style, which will be released in September.

After a recent stint in New York - where she shared an Instagram snap from the Fashion Institute of Technology captioned 'Getting inspired' - she jetted off to London this morning.

Last week, her sister Paris joined in on the mounting excitement for 365 Style, tweeting: 'Congrats @NickyHilton on your new book! So proud of you! Can't wait for your style guide to be released in September!'
