Back under observation: Authorities admit they lost panhandler Michael Lively in Dallas after the homeless man was potentially exposed to Ebola while riding in the same ambulance as Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who brought Ebola to America

A homeless man who added to the panic in Dallas after officials let him get away after he potentially came into contact with Ebola-infected bodily fluids was back under observation Sunday evening.

Michael Lively, who was the first person to ride in the ambulance that carried U.S. Ebola patient zero to the hospital, was taken to the psych ward of Parkland Hospital following a city-wide search by rattled Dallas police.

Police are working to obtain a court order to hold Lively at the hospital, against his will if necessary.

Authorities had monitored him a day earlier but want to take his temperature regularly to make sure he doesn't have a fever, a possible symptom of Ebola infection. 

Losing track of Lively was just the latest mistake by authorities in Texas, who have come in for heavy criticism over their handling of the Ebola outbreak.

Lucky for Texas, Lively is not sick and not showing any symptoms of the disease.

Texas public health officials say there is 'zero chance' the homeless man spread Ebola to anyone else - even if he became infected with it.

Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Friedan sought to reassure a jittery public during a press conference from Atlanta, police in Dallas combed the streets in search of Lively, who rode in the same ambulance that transported Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan to the hospital.

It is possible that Lively came into contact with Duncan's Ebola-infected bodily fluids during that ride. 

The CDC is currently monitoring 48 people in Dallas who may have come into contact with Duncan while he was contagious with the deadly disease.

Clean up: Members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital on October 5

Precautions: Hazardous material cleaners spray disinfectant on their personal protective equipment after working in the apartment

Getting a peak: Neighbors watch as members of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company are seen as they sanitize the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital

Contamination: Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance that picked up Michael Lively next

Ebola can manifest in a patient any time up to 21 days after exposure. A patient is not contagious until symptoms begin to emerge.

Lively is rated as 'low risk' for infection by authorities, but officials were still desperate to monitor him.

At a press conference on Sunday, CDC Director Thomas Friedan declared: 'There’s no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' 

Ebola is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. Duncan was reportedly sweating profusely and vomiting when he was taken to the hospital. 

He said that of the 48 people at risk for becoming infect with Ebola, just ten are considered high-risk. Three of them are the family members that Duncan stayed with in a Dallas apartment and seven are healthcare workers who came into contact with him while he was contagious. 

Unlucky number: The ambulance from Dallas Fire-Rescue station 37 that carried infected patient Thomas Eric Duncan picked up at least one passenger being being fully decontaminated. That passenger, a homeless man, is now missing 

Projecting calm: Dr Thomas Friedan, the director of the CDC, said health officials in Dallas are successfully containing the Ebola outbreak there

He noted that none of the people being monitored has shown any signs of being ill. 

On Saturday, Texas Presbyterian Hospital announced that Duncan's health had declined and that he is now in critical condition and 'fighting for his life' against the disease. 

Duncan is not receiving any experimental drugs to fight the Ebola because officials fear his body could not handle the medication in his current unstable condition. Instead, doctors are giving him 'supportive care,' ABC News reports.

Supplies of ZMapp, the miracle drug that cured two American Ebola patients and a British nurse, have run out. Drug makers are working to produce more, but the process takes months. 

Friedan said today that he will brief President Barack Obama on the outbreak tomorrow and that officials are considering stepping up checks at airports to help prevent infected patients from entering the country. 

Currently, travelers from West African nations are checked for fever and questioned about their contact with Ebola patients at their departure airports, but are not formally screened before being allowed to enter the U.S.

Duncan allegedly lied to airport officials and told them he had not been in contact with anyone infected with Ebola before flying out of Monrovia, Liberia, last month.

Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not

Relocated: Two of Duncan's relatives who were quarantined inside the apartment are seen leaving and being moved to another, undisclosed location 

Friedan stood by the screening procedures, pointing out today that 77 people have been prevented from getting on planes in West Africa thanks to the efforts of airport officials who were trained by the CDC.

Despite the calm and collected image that the CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services today, doctors and public health officials have repeatedly fumbled when confronted with the virus. 

When Duncan first went to the hospital with a high fever on September 25, he was given antibiotics and sent home - despite revealing that he had recently been in Ebola-stricken Liberia. He was not diagnosed with the disease until his girlfriend called an ambulance on September 28.

The ambulance transported at least one other person before being taken out of service.

Then, after the the case of Ebola was confirmed, family members and friends who had contact with Duncan said they were left to go about their daily routines without contact from the CDC or local health officials.

Four days after the Ebola diagnosis, Duncan's girlfriend revealed that his sweat-stained sheets were still on his bed and that no one from the CDC or health department had been by to collect his belongings.

It was not until Friday that a cleaning crew finally arrived to remove the infectious items and clean the apartment.
