The fiance of an architect who died trying to rescue him from their burning flat said she had a 'big heart' and always put the 'lives of others before her own'.

Sophie Rosser, 23, was coming home from a party in Chelsea when she noticed smoke pouring from the block of apartments.

Fearing her partner Oscar Silva, 28, was trapped inside by the flames, she ran into the property in the Isle of Dogs, East London, in a bid to save him.

Heartbroken: Oscar Silva, said his fiance Sophie Rosser, 23, 'put the lives of others before her own'. She died running into her burning East London flat, believing he was inside

But Mr Silva had escaped to the safety of the balcony and had to watch as paramedics battled to save his girlfriend, who had collapsed in the smoke.

Cardiff-born Miss Rosser died from her burns in the Royal London Hospital later that day.

Today Mr Silva broke down in tears as he spoke outside Poplar Coroners Court.

Speaking after her inquest and clutching Miss Rosser's tearful mother Michelle for support, he said: 'She was a person with a big heart.

'She put the life of others before her own. Unfortunately that is how people of her kind act.'

But he was too overcome with emotion to say anything else.

Today,
 coroner Mary Hassell criticised a catalogue of fire safety failures at 
the apartment block, but ruled the 23-year-old's death was an accident.

Tragic: Cardiff-born Miss Rosser died from her burns in the Royal London Hospital later that day after the fire at a property in the Isle of Dogs

She said the young architect was driven by love when she ran into the burning building in a 'understandable and very human' bid to rescue her boyfriend.

But she did what nobody but the fire brigade should do, and paid the price with her life, the coroner said.

Delivering her conclusions, Ms Hassell said: 'Sophie's partner was trapped on the floor above and, Sophie returning from a night out, saw the fire and realised what it was.

'And in an effort to help him she did what nobody should do except the fire brigade, and entered a burning building.

'She
 did so because she was desperate to try to effect a rescue. But her 
actions meant that it was she who had to be rescued, and led to the loss
 of her life.

'It is very easy for us now to say Sophie should never have gone into that building, and of course she never should have.

'But
 that is a much easier thing to say after the event, and not in the 
moment when you are in a complete panic about your loved one.

Person with a big heart: The fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor apartment at Meridian Place

'Just because it is something she shouldn't have done doesn't mean to say it is not something very understandable and very human.'

The fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor flat at Meridian Place on the Isle of Dogs, east London, in the early hours of August 26, 2012.

Ms Hassell said the fire quickly spread because the apartment's self-closing fire door was damaged and got stuck on the floor.

In the confusion of the thick black smoke, Miss Rosser went to the fourth floor - the floor below her own flat on the fifth - where the fire was raging and was overcome by the powerful flames.

She quickly fell unconscious and died in hospital later that day from her burns.

The coroner hit out at a string of failures in the fire safety of the block of flats - which she said was partly to blame for the tragedy.

Selfless: Outside Poplar Coroner's Court, Mr Silva said: 'Unfortunately, that is how people of her kind act'. He then was too overcome with emotion to continue speaking about the death of his fiance

And she said Miss Rosser's death could have been avoided if the self-closing fire door was functioning as it should have been.

She said she had 'considered very, very carefully the potential contribution to this sad story of the building itself and the procedures in place to deal with fire,'

She added: 'If the door to flat 101 had been shut the fire would have been very significantly contained until the fire brigade arrived.

'And I think it would have allowed all the occupants to have made good their escape.

'The fire brigade came quickly. The fire door was a good one and it would have kept the fire back.'

Safety: The coroner revealed there had been just one fire risk assessment carried out in 15 years at Meridian Place in Marsh Wall, East London

The inquest heard claims the tenant had complained about the door, but it had not been fixed.

And
 the smoke detectors were never tested by housing firm Komoto Group, 
which own many of the properties in the block, and have only been tested
 once since the fire.

Just one fire risk assessment had been carried out in the 15 years from when the block was built in 1997 until the 2012 fire.

And the inquest heard that a fire ventilation shaft that should have funnelled the smoke out of the building was too small.

The coroner said the doors of the ventilation shaft did not open on the fourth floor, and the hallway had no windows and 'was not properly ventilated'.

But she said these other safety failures did not contribute to Miss Rosser's death.

Couple: The coroner ruled there had been safety failings in the flat, but ruled the death as an accident

She added: 'The one thing that would have made the world of difference, other than the fire not being started in the first place, is if the door to flat 101 (where the fire broke out) had been closed.'

The coroner said she had considered making a prevention of future deaths report by writing to the authorities with recommendations for safety improvements.

But she ruled this out because she could not think of a concrete recommendation she should make that would 'prevent a tragedy for the future'.

Turning to Miss Rosser's tearful loved ones sat in the court's front row, she said she was 'so, so sorry' for their loss.
