Ed Miliband was ridiculed yesterday after laying a wreath honouring the First World War dead with a scruffy message that read: 'From the Leader of the Opposition' .

The note, scrawled with a black marker by an organiser, was left at the Cenotaph in Glasgow yesterday and has been branded 'pathetic' and 'distasteful'.

But the Labour leader's team say he was denied the chance to write his own message and was only handed the wreath moments before he put it down.

Contrast: A row has erupted online after David Cameron left a handwritten note on a WW1 wreath but Ed Miliband's just said his title and was written with a black marker

Incident: Political leaders were asked to lay tributes by Mr Miliband's team say he was handed his seconds before he put it down and was not allowed to write his own message

In contrast David Cameron's message read: 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister.

The Prince of Wales also wrote his own note, which said: 'In everlasting memory, Charles'.  

Nick Clegg also put down a wreath with a note in the same handwriting, which only said: 'From the Deputy Prime Minister'.

The incident has led to a row online with some calling Mr Miliband 'pathetic' and others claiming he had been 'stitched up'. 

Sarah Cochrane wrote: 'I think Ed Miliband's message on the wreath is pathetic. He couldn't even be bothered to write his own name'.

Marion Armer said 'he must have put a lot of thought into that tribute'. 

Defence: Labour supporters say that Mr Miliband has been 'stitched up' over the incident

Similar: The wreath put down by Nick Clegg also had a note containing his job title

This tribute from the People of Scotland was also written in the same black marker

Commemorations:  Prince Charles, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband were taking part in a series of events being held 100 years to the day after the start of the First World War

Others, including former Tory MP Louise Mensch, compared the incident to accusations former Labour leader Michael Foot wore a donkey jacket at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 1981. Mr Foot denied the claims and said the coat was an expensive gift from his wife.

Ms Mensch 
added: 'I am stunned by Ed Miliband's WWI centenary wreath message, 
which is arrogant, disrespectful and just plain rude.'

Gordon
 Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride said in a blog post: 'Did Ed 
Miliband’s team really forget to have that conversation with the 
ceremony organisers?

'Was the first any of them knew about the message on
 the wreath really when it was handed to their leader 30 seconds before 
he had lay it. And is their operation really as lacklustre and resigned 
to their fate as Nick Clegg’s, who did the same thing?

Upset: Twitter users have ridiculed the Labour leader for the message left at the Cenotaph

Leaving: Queen Elizabeth II (left) departs after attending a service of commemoration at Crathie Kirk Church in Crathie, Aberdeenshire

Act of remembrance: Prince Philip, Duke Of Edinburgh attends a service of commemoration at Sandringham Church in Norfolk

'Or
 is it a more serious problem: that the fear of being the first to screw
 up after Miliband’s image speech means even the most effective staffers
 are scared to do their jobs properly, especially on an issue as 
sensitive as commemorating the war dead?'

Mr Miliband's supporters said this afternoon any criticism was unfair.

A source told MailOnline it was a
 Government-organised ceremony and 'Ed was handed the wreath seconds 
before and had not chance to write his own message.This was essentially a
 label being used by the organisers to give him the right wreath'.

A Labour spokesman added: ‘We were very disappointed that Ed was not given the chance to write a personal message.’

A source close to Nick Clegg said: 'The option of hand signing was not one we were ever given.

Former members of the Armed Forces were among the 1.400 people remembering the start of the Great War yesterday in Glasgow

'The DPM was handed the wreath seconds before he laid it and there was no opportunity to do anything differently.'

The incident happened at hundreds of people gathered at George Square for the wreath-laying ceremony.

Chief
 Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Home Secretary Theresa May 
and Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities, were among those 
who attended the hour-long service in the heart of the city.

Prince Charles, sitting next to Mr Cameron, listened as prayers were said and a bugler played the Last Post.

Members of the public lined the square to pay their respects, many of them clutching union flags.
