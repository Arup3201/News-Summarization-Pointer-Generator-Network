A 32-year-old Indian man acquitted of the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl was arrested on Friday after an almost identical attack.

He had been released from jail for two other rape-murders just months earlier, because of good behaviour.

Sunil Suresh (aka Pappu Salve) is now accused of kidnapping a nine-year-old girl from Shirdi town in Maharashtra in December and carrying out another brutal attack.

Furious: Indian activists on hunger strike at a protest in New Delhi over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student

His story is the latest in a series of horrific rape cases to besiege India, following the gang-rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus a few weeks ago and the rape of a 29-year-old on a coach in northern India on Friday.

Salve was detained yesterday near Manmad railway station by Shirdi police and later appeared in Rahata local court, which remanded him to police custody till January 17.

His most recent previous arrest came in 2003, when he was given the death sentence following the rape and murder of a girl in Sinnar area of Nashik district.

He appealed in the Bombay High Court against the sentence and was acquitted, police sources said.

Shockingly, he was already serving two jail terms - of ten years and seven years each - over rape and murder allegations made against him at Ambad and Nashik police stations in 2002, police said.

He was released from the Nashik road jail on May 28, 2012, for those crimes because of good behaviour, according to India Today.

Salve then allegedly raped and murdered another nine-year-old on December 28 2012, and dumped the body at an isolated spot near Shirdi railway station.

The decomposed body was recovered on Friday night, police said.

Additional Superintendent of Police Sunita Thakare said yesterday that a rape and murder case against Salve will be tried by a fast-track court.

Enraged Shirdi locals went on a protest march yesterday to demand vigorous punishment for Salve.

'On December 28, when the girl didn't return home from school, her parents began searching for her and Salve helped them in the search,' Inspector Datta Pawar told the Times of India.

'Another girl told her parents that she had seen the victim with Salve in the afternoon of December 28.'

Salve, who sold photo frames outside the Shirdi temple, then fled the area.

Police teams were formed to track him down Salve. On Friday, they learnt that Salve, who had been living with his wife and two children in Shirdi after his release, had called his spouse and asked her to come to Manmad railway station.

Inspector Pawar added: 'We laid a trap and nabbed him. During interrogation, he admitted to having raped and murdered the girl.'

The inspector said Salve had ensnred the girl by asking her to help him find his 12-year-old son, and had later buried her boy near the railway station.

'We are probing whether he has committed any other crimes after being released from jail in May last year,' he added.

Sunita Salunkhe-Thakre, additional superintendent of police (Ahmednagar), confirmed that the high court had acquitted Salve in the Sinnar case.

She said in 2002, three similar cases were registered against Salve by Ambad and Nashik road police stations.

'In the case registered by the Ambad police, Salve was charged with kidnapping and rape and sentenced to six years' rigorous imprisonment. In the two cases under the Nashik Road police station, he was sentenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for kidnap, rape and murder in one, but acquitted of kidnap and rape in the other,' she said.

An organisation working for nomadic tribes blocked roads in Shirdi on Saturday to protest against the crime. State agriculture minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil met the parents of the victim and announced a financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh.

Inspector general (special) Dhananjay Kamlakar of Nashik Range said police superintendents have been told to examine judgments in such cases before deciding on the legal course of action to be taken.
