When Oscar Garcia quit as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer he cited the prospect of Islamic militant rockets flying over the club training ground as a reason to leave. As reasons go, it’s as good as it gets. The man that succeeded him though, was undeterred.

Indeed, former Liverpool coach Pako Ayestaran has never been afraid of taking bold steps. At Valencia, when trusted assistant to Rafa Benitez, he was the man who encouraged Benitez to move to Liverpool when the opportunity arose.

‘I was a Liverpool fan,’ says Ayestaran. ‘As a boy I had seen their team in 1975, with Toshack and Keegan, beat Real Sociedad 9-1 and it stuck with me. When I heard Rafa had the chance to go, I said he had to take it.’

Equally, when he felt Benitez had lost sight of what made their partnership so good, Ayestaran left Liverpool. Their friendship was fractured and never repaired but Ayestaran used those early principles to forge his own management career.

When Maccabi sports director Jordi Cruyff called about moving to Tel Aviv, Ayestaran sensed an opportunity; not one of danger and trepidation but a challenge he could relish.

‘It is similar to when I was a young man in the 70s and 80s in the Basque country in Spain,’ says Ayestaran. ‘I was living with the threat of ETA, the Basque separatists, and bombs every day. People would call and ask ‘’are you ok there?’’ And you’d say ‘’yes I’m off to the park’’ or ‘’I’m having a cup of coffee’’. In my mind, life was normal.

‘Tel Aviv is different to the north of Israel. If conflict starts it is normally on the West Bank or Jerusalem but not so much here.

‘It has been peaceful since the ceasefire was agreed in August. I can lead a normal life here. As normal as in London or Paris. The quality of life here is amazing. I will take my son to play tennis later and on Thursday I am going to the opera.’ 

Today, Ayestaran is eating lunch at a bistro on the Tel Aviv promenade. He looks trim, sharply dressed and sunglasses protect him from the glare of bright sunshine as the Mediterranean Sea laps over the busy beach.

He has embraced Cruyff’s challenge. Maccabi have won one trophy, the Toto Cup, and a 2-1 victory over Maccabi Haifa on Monday means they are still on course for a domestic treble for the first time in their 109 year history.

It is clear the methods Ayestaran practised at Anfield and since with last club Tecos in Mexico are having an effect. ‘One thing I learned is that you have to listen to your staff,’ Ayestaran says pointedly.

‘You may have your own ideas and make a different decision but the people around you are there for a reason and it’s important you account for that in your management and coaching.

‘Expectation is high here because of the club’s history but I’m not afraid of that. You have to take responsibility. It’s the evolution of a team, increasing the levels. I set a target of winning the treble early on and that brings pressure but that’s a pressure I’m happy with.

'The Israeli people are passionate about their football and it’s a release in many ways from what else goes on in life here.’

Football remains Israel’s most popular sport along with basketball and swimming. Israel top their group in the European Championship qualifiers and host Wales on Saturday. 

Maccabi have four players in the squad, one, attacking midfielder Eran Zehavi, has been the subject of interest from Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund while Crystal Palace tried to sign him in January. He has scored 31 goals this season already.

‘It’s a gift for Maccabi to have him at the club,’ says Ayestaran. ‘A player with the right character to take this club one step forward. He could certainly succeed in the Premier League.’ 

The 52-year-old Ayestaran retains a strong interest in English football where he is also drawing attention from clubs looking at foreign coaches. He has kept his house, a stone’s throw away from the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Wirral, and is still in contact with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. They met up for lunch on a recent trip back to the UK.

‘We had a glass of wine and talked about football,’ says Ayestaran. ‘They are great characters. Jamie is like a sponge for information, he soaks up everything. I can remember at Liverpool when he was in the treatment room and he was having a debate about who played right-back in the 1974 FA Cup final. 

'He approaches everything with such passion. I can see him coaching one day. Steven is also so passionate about the game and the project he is taking on in Los Angeles. When I arrived at Liverpool I think they were both a little unsure; they’d give their opinions but they listened and had respect for what we wanted to do. 

'It made them think more about what they were doing as players and they are great students of the game. Their personalities are strong and they helped coaches to set the standard at Liverpool. For them the club came first.’

While his bond with many of the friends he made in Liverpool is intact, Ayestaran admits regret that his relationship with Benitez remains broken. The pair won promotion at Tenerife, two Spanish titles with Valencia and the Champions League at Liverpool. 

‘It’s sad that we haven’t spoken. We had a lot of very good moments and it’s better to remember those than the bad, life is too short.’ 

Ayestaran though is making confident strides as the main man. After Benitez, he took time out to learn from coaches such as Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola, had a short spell as director of football at Real Sociedad and spent time with Porto.

‘I’ve found it a natural transition,’ he says. ‘I needed my own project. It’s important that clubs have a model like Porto where even if change in personnel comes, and sometimes frequently, the model, the belief remains.’ 

And could he see himself in England again soon? 

‘It’s the place I enjoy the most and my sons still consider England home. I would love that one day but for now my focus is Maccabi Tel Aviv - then maybe England can be my next chapter.’
