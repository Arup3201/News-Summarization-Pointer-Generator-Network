Arturo Vidal has revealed he is still struggling with the knee injury that plagued him towards the end of last season.

The Juventus star was forced to undergo knee surgery in May but returned in time to help Chile reach the last 16 of the World Cup - despite failing to complete a full 90 minutes in Brazil.

The 27-year-old was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer, but the deal never materialised.

And the midfielder has admitted he is still not 100 per cent fit. 

'The knee caused - and is causing - me problems,' Vidal told reporters after Juventus' 2-1 derby win over Torino in Serie A on Sunday. 'But I'm trying to get in top shape.' 

In seven Serie A starts for Juventus, Vidal has been substituted off on four occasions with boss Massimiliano Allegri carefully handling his playing time so far.

Despite his fitness concerns that hasn't stopped Vidal's goalscoring touch - with the Chile international netting Juventus' opener from the penalty spot against their local rivals on Sunday to take his tally to four goals in all competitions this campaign to date.
