A 16-year-old British jihadist asked 
his mother for a cuddle before running away to Syria to fight alongside
 his brother, who later died in battle alongside Islamic rebels.

Abdullah Deghayes, 18, from Brighton, 
is believed to have died in Kassab, in Latakia province, earlier this 
month after disappearing from the UK in January with his brother Jaffar, 16.

Their mother Einas Abulsayen said that the two boys left without warning, after the younger boy tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. They were following in the footsteps, she said, of their older brother Amer, 20, who went to Syria in October with an aid convoy.

Speaking to the Times from the family home in Brighton, the mother-of-six said the last time she saw Jaffar was when he was looking for his glasses.

'He said: "Mummy, give me a cuddle." This cuddle: he wants to say goodbye. I didn't know that's the last cuddle until now. Hopefully not the last one.'

She revealed she had left the house while Abdullah was showering, and so had not seen her older son on the day he left to take up arms alongside Syrian rebels.

Later that day, when she realised her sons would not return home, she began to frantically call them - but their phones were switched off.

She was contacted on April 14 by Amer, via an instant messaging service, who told her that Abdullah had been killed. It is claimed that he was shot while trying to help against an attack by government forces.

 Deghayes, who learned of his son’s death via Facebook, pleaded for his other two sons to return.

He
 told the Guardian: ‘Amer, Jaffar, if you see me or this interview 
please, please come back home. Enough. This war has taken Abdullah 
already... I’d like to see you live longer.’

Mr Deghayes insisted his three sons were not ‘terrorists’ but had travelled to Syria to defend ‘those who are weak’.

Abdullah,
 who was due to go to university in Brighton, is the nephew of Omar 
Deghayes, who was held by the United States as an enemy combatant at 
Guantanamo Bay detention camp between 2002 and 2007 after he was 
arrested in Pakistan.

Police will launch national campaign to stop would-be terrorists travelling to Syria today, following a dramatic rise in the number of people being arrested after going to the war-torn state.

UK authorities have long expressed fears about aspiring jihadis travelling to Syria for terrorist training, and it is thought that hundreds of Britons have already been there.

Today, Scotland Yard said that 40 Syria-related arrests were made in the first three months of this year, up from 25 in the whole of last year.

Senior National Co-ordinator Counter-Terrorism Helen Ball said: ‘We are increasingly concerned about the numbers of young people who have or are intending to travel to Syria to join the conflict.

'We want to ensure that people, particularly women, who are concerned about their loved ones are given enough information about what they can do to prevent this from happening.

‘We want to increase their confidence in the police and partners to encourage them to come forward so that we can intervene and help. This is not about criminalising people it is about preventing tragedies. We want to inform those who wish to genuinely help the Syrian cause how they can do so safely and legally.’

Workers from the Prevent counter-terrorism scheme, the Charity Commission and other groups will meet at Scotland Yard today for the launch of the campaign, particularly aimed at women who are concerned about young people planning to travel to Syria.

Other events are also being held across the country, and leaflets highlighting the risks of going to the Middle Eastern state will be handed out at ports. Police have advised those who want to support humanitarian efforts in Syria to donate to charities instead of going there.

Michelle Russell, from the Charity Commission, said: ‘There is a genuine and desperate need for humanitarian assistance to help people affected by the conflict in Syria. UK charities and their partners are playing an important role in the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria and its neighbouring countries. In part, they have only been able to do this by the generous donations of the public.

‘We want everyone to make informed choices about which charities to support and how to support them so that they can feel confident that their contribution really will make a difference to the humanitarian effort.’

The campaign is being launched after the father of a British teenager killed in Syria said he is ‘scared’ for his two other sons and urged them to leave the war-torn country where they have gone to fight.

Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died.

Those who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack.

The married father of three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.

Photographs were also published in January of two British brothers, named in reports as Akra and Mohamed Sebah from north London, who were believed to have died in battle in the war-torn country in September.

Other Britons have died after going to help with humanitarian relief.

Dr Abbas Khan, a father of two from London, died while being held in custody by the Syrian government on December 17.

The family of the 32-year-old orthopaedic surgeon, who was captured in Aleppo in November 2012, claims he was murdered while being held prisoner. The Syrian government claims he committed suicide.
