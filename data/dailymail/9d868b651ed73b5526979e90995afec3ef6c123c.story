Such was the ease with which Anthony Joshua broke down Denis Bakhtov in exactly four minutes on Saturday night that he immediately returned to his dressing room to hit the pads with his trainer for half an hour.

‘I was scheduled for 10 rounds and it only went two, so it was back to work to make up the rest,’ he said.

That warm-down was just five minutes shorter than the time the heavyweight has spent in the ring since making his professional debut at the same O2 Arena 12 months and nine fights ago.

Anthony Joshua fired out a warning to his rivals with the crushing defeat of veteran Kazakh Denis Bakhtov

Joshua's warm-down lasted just five minutes less than the Watford-born fighter spent in the ring 

He displayed a hitherto unseen menace as he licked his lips, grinned, and brutally dismantled the Kazakh veteran of 47 fights.

Bakhtov had not been stopped in almost a decade and was expected to give Joshua the rounds he craves, but proved to be just another punch bag.

‘It ended a bit early,’ lamented Joshua. ‘I wanted to learn and practise some stuff. Even when I was an amateur, I had a desire to hurt opponents. When I’m sparring, I get that same vision I had against Bakhtov, I want to get you, I want to hurt you. I’ll never forget where I came from and that gives me that desire. These guys are in there to take what I’ve been working towards for seven years.

‘They (his fights) get stopped pretty early. I wanted him on the floor, out cold.

‘I don’t like it when the referees step in and stop the fight. That’s why I end up hitting them because they get in the way!

‘It’s fun. If he had me up against the ropes, punching my head, he would love it but it’s the other way round.’

Joshua picked up the WBC International title, little more than a piece of expensive bling, which will head straight into storage. But the lasting impression will linger long in the heavyweight division.

‘I need to put this behind me,’ was Joshua’s oft-repeated mantra as the 24-year-old attempts to keep his feet on the ground while others predict both fame and fortune.

‘Not everyone will get knocked out like that, not everyone will fold under pressure. There’s a whole ocean of heavyweights out there,’ he added. ‘There’s been a long line of heavyweights and there’s always two or three that rise to the top. I’ve got the potential but I’ve got to graft and grind to bring that dream to a reality.’

And after a low-key 25th birthday on Wednesday, Joshua must turn his attention to six weeks hence when he faces Michael Sprott in Liverpool.

The 39-year-old from Reading had won five consecutive, if underwhelming, fights before he was knocked out in the first round by an unheralded Kiwi in June. Promoter Eddie Hearn was barely half-joking when he said he could imagine Sprott having a change of heart or at the very least demanding a larger cheque.

While Joshua insists he remains ‘the contender’, Hearn has long predicted a British title fight at Watford’s Vicarage Road next summer, just three miles from the Meriden Estate where Joshua grew up.

Beyond that the likes of David Price, Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora will follow his every move. The man himself would go as far only to say that he hoped to be at the top of the domestic pile by the end of his second year.

As for his first, the Olympic champion refused to rate himself higher than one out of 10.

‘I’ve got years to go,’ he added. ‘Let me do the same thing to Wladimir Klitschko then I’ll give myself a 10. That was Denis Bakhtov not Klitschko, he’s not a world champion.’
