Ukraine has refused to call a truce with pro-Russian rebels vowing to end their bloody insurgency with force unless they lay down their arms.

Ukrainian forces have scored a string of surprise military successes since the weekend that forced most of the militias to retreat to the sprawling eastern industrial hubs of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has now ordered his troops to blockade the insurgents inside the cities and cut them off from any further arms supplies.Â

The unconditional stance reflects a new confidence in Kiev and comes as they are on the verge of quashing the uprising.

This is despite EU leaders pushing for a diplomatic solution to the conflict as well as Russia own efforts to force Ukraine to make compromises to preserve the east of the country's links to Moscow.

Defence minister Valeriy Geletey said in a statement: 'Now, any negotiations are possibly only after the rebels completely lay down their arms.'

The president made an unannounced visit to Slavyansk, a former rebel-held city reclaimed by Kiev on Saturday and said that talks with the uprising's commanders were impossible because most were now hiding in Moscow.

Mr Poroshenko told reporters that he would only speak to 'the real masters of Donbass - the steel workers and miners' in the conflict zone.

Meanwhile separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov claimed that his men had managed to actually push back Ukrainian troops from parts of Lugansk and had received fresh supplies of anti-aircraft and artillery guns.

The Ukraine's message to the rebels will now mean Russian president Vladimir Putin faces a tough choice between dealing a blow to Russia's economy by further boosting support for the rebels or seeing his own popularity suffer by taking no action at all.

Germany's Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding said: 'He may either have to step up his support for the pro-Russian insurgents who are now on the defensive or he may be seen as letting Ukraine advance on the ground in Donbass.

'The former could trigger more serious sanctions and further capital flight from Russia. The latter could hurt his popularity and his 'strongman' image in Russia where (he) had whipped up nationalist sentiment in the last five months.'

EU leaders had hoped that a new truce and a promise from the Kremlin not to meddle could have been agreed.

French president Francois Hollande said he intended to press Mr Poroshenko on a truce tomorrow during a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Meanwhile the U.S. has consistently backed the campaign waged by Ukrainian troops since the Ukrainian president promised to quickly quash the uprising after his election in May.

The United States views Ukraine's territorial integrity as vital to European security and important to halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's seeming ambition to resurrect a tsarist or post-Soviet empire.

US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated on Monday that 'the government of Ukraine is defending the country of Ukraine, and I think they have every right to do that.'
