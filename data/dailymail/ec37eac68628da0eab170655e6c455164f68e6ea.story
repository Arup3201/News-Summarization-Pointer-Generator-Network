An 18-year-old mother has been arrested after a sickening photo of her crying 14-month-old son hanging from a hook by his shirt was posted on Facebook.

Alexis Breeden from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, took the disturbing image of the youngster suspended from a door frame with what appears to be a top pulled around his neck.

The picture was believed to have been put on Facebook by the boy's father in retaliation after he had an argument with Breeden.

It was then shared by a number of other people before users began to send it to the sheriff's office Facebook page.

The mother then turned herself in after a felony warrant was issued for her arrest last week. 

After police visited the child at home, she reportedly wrote on Facebook: 'They think this was immature and dumb of me but saw I was playing and no one needs to know everything going on because some of you aren't parents and no one knows the full story.' 

Sgt. James Konicki with the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office told CBS 6: 'We had it assigned to a criminal investigation detective through the child victim unit. 

'When she responded, she did an investigation and found that it wasn't a nail, it was actually a planter hook that the child was hanging from. But the child was absolutely fine.'

'The baby's father and mother had an argument and in retaliation the father posted this on Facebook to get the mother in trouble.' 

Konicki added that the father of the child was not involved in the alleged abuse. 

Breeden was released on a $2500 and is now facing child abuse charges. 

A press release from the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office read: 'On October 29, 2014, the Spotslyvania Sheriff's Office was made aware of an image that was circulating on Facebook.
