First home buyers may be allowed to spend their superannuation to help them buy a property, Treasurer Joe Hokey has proposed.

Mr Hockey says it is due to the aging population in Australia that the role superannuation needs to be reconsidered, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

However the notion has been met with discontent among the Grattan Institute, Labor and the superannuation association, who warn that house prices will rise if the idea was put into place.

This comes as the recent release of the Abbott government's Intergenerational Report revealed a snapshot of the next 40 years, showing Australians can expect to live into their mid-90s in 2055.

Mr Hockey said on Friday that the government may have to make fundamental changes to the superannuation system, considering Australia's ageing population. 

'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I am concerned about rising house prices and the accessibility to homes and homeownership for younger Australians, but we've got a limited pool of savings. We need to have these conversations.'

However John Daley from the Grattan Institute told the Sydney Morning Herald he was against the prospect, saying that Mr Hockey's proposal would only increase housing costs.

'It won't improve the problem around supply. If supply remains constant and you effectively increase the amount that people can pay then prices will go up. This is economics 101,' Mr Daley said.

'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey said 

Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen was also opposed to the notion as he told the Sydney Morning Herald that it goes against the principle behind superannuation.

These views were echoed by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia as they expressed that such a proposal would only help those on higher salaries rather than Australians who earn less.

On Thursday, the Abbott government's first intergenerational report was released and found that by 2054/55 there will be about 40,000 people aged over 100 years in Australia.

These figures were compared to about 122 Australians aged over 100 in 1974/75 and around 4,000 now.

The report also highlighted that the number of people aged over 65 is expected to double and the population will be 39.7 million.
