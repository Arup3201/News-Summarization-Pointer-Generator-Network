With viewing figures of almost 
10 million every week, the popularity of ITV's 
charming period drama Downton Abbey is in no doubt.

But
it appears a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans who are so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of
the 1920s characters that they want to dress like them too.

Not only have fashion brands reported increased interest in retro flapper style dresses and demure ruffled blouses - but apparently we are in such awe of ladies of the 
manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley that we are keen to copy their nightwear too.

Since Downton Abbey hit screens again, vintage nightwear sales have surged

As the most recent series of Downton Abbey returns to our screens, 1920s luxury lingerie brand Lucile has reported seeing an unprecedented increase in sales - thanks, they say, to the fact that the brand's name was mentioned during the show. 

Lucile lingerie, a brand which was very popular in the 1920s and has since been revived, has seen website traffic increase by 62 per cent and overall sales increase by 48 per cent since the hit show returned.

The brand was only recently revived by the great great granddaughter of the brand's original creator, Lady Duff Gordon, and is in its first season of selling.

Lady Duff Gordon was a legend in the lingerie world and created revolutionary designs for couture brands opening boutique stores in New York, Paris, Chicago, and the most famous flagship ‘Maison Lucile’ in Hanover Square, London.

She made her mark in the fashion world by designing lingerie deemed scandalous at the time, free as it was from corsetry and wired underskirts.

The lingerie brand, which was famous in the 1920's, has been redesigned with a modern twist

Lucile lingerie quickly became popular with film stars, royalty and nobility - the Queen of Spain, Lily Elsie, and the Duchess of Warwick - all flocked to her famous boutiques.

An ‘It Girl’ of the Belle Époque era, Lady Duff Gordon's designs challenged and changed both the fashion industry and women’s perception of how they should look and feel.

The female form was the inspiration behind each garment, with beautiful fabrics draped to create feminine silhouettes.

Lady Gordon’s great-great granddaughter,
Camilla Blois, has now reinvented the brand - and has seen sales soar. 
The £715 Indiscretions Gown has already sold out, while the £499 Duchess
of Warwick short kimono has an extensive waiting list.

The female form was the inspiration behind each garment which evoked an air of elegance and grandeur

Lucile's British heritage is the very core of the brand and perfectly reflects the glamour of Downton, as seen here in vintage images from the brand's archives
