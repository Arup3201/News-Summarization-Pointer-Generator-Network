Sky Sports are to broadcast The Open Championship for five years from 2017 at a cost of over £15million-a-year.

The official announcement from the R&A that Sky had won the exclusive rights to the Open after what will be 60 years of BBC broadcasts came on Tuesday afternoon.

Sportsmail had revealed on Saturday that Sky had reached an agreement with the R&A at a cost of over £10million – and that BBC would only retain the consolation prize of highlights.

But it’s understood the price that Sky have paid is nearer £15m than £10m giving the R&A almost a 100 per cent increase from the £7m paid by the BBC in their current contract which will end after this year's tournament at St Andrews in July. 

As Sportsmail also reported, the Corporation have been resigned to losing their flagship golf contract to Sky for some time and had prioritised keeping Match of the Day highlights, which they have done.

But the R&A’s decision to take the money from subscription TV – chief executive Peter Dawson’s last big move before he steps down later this year – will not do anything to help golf’s falling participation figures and has been widely criticised by numerous big names in the sport, including Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood and Peter Alliss.

Speaking in an open letter on the Open's official website, Dawson said: 'We believe this new arrangement, which will see The Open broadcast live on Sky with prime-time highlights on the BBC, will allow golf’s oldest championship to maintain its position as one of the world’s premier sporting events.

'I want to express my gratitude to the BBC, our trusted broadcast partner for 60 years. Our relationship developed through The Open’s renaissance in the early 1960s, golf’s boom years in the 1970s and 80s and more recently the height of its global appeal during the 90s and 2000s. 

'We are delighted that the BBC remains a broadcast partner of The Open Championship for 2017 and beyond and, we hope, for a great many years to come.'

The ‘crown jewels’ are a list of prestigious sporting events of national importance which may interest non-sports fans.

- Wimbledon non-finals play — live coverage on BBC

- All other matches in Rugby World Cup finals — all 2015 matches will be shown live on ITV or ITV4

- The Open — live on BBC until 2016

- The Ryder Cup — exclusive UK live coverage on Sky Sports since 1995

'We have considered this new agreement extremely carefully and firmly believe that by working with the two leading sports broadcasters for the UK and Ireland we have achieved the best result not just for the future of The Open but for golf as a whole.'

Barney Francis, Sky Sports Managing Director, added: 'The Open is the world’s pre-eminent golf championship and we are committed to taking coverage of the event to new levels. 

'We offer something for every sports fan and this exciting agreement for The Open means our customers can now enjoy all four Majors live. 

'Sky Sports has a passion for golf that has spanned two decades, offering unrivalled commitment, airtime and promotion as well as year-round innovative coverage.

'We look forward to working with The R&A to entertain and engage new and existing golf fans through our multi-platform coverage and also at the grassroots level via Sky Academy.' 

The BBC will offer two-hour daily highlights and live coverage on radio and online.

Barbara Slater, the BBC's director of sport, said, 'We're obviously disappointed that we were unable to retain live TV coverage of The Open Championship.

'However, we're pleased to be continuing our 60-year partnership with the R&A and feel that a comprehensive two hour highlights programme - a format which has already proven successful - in a prime-time slot over four days will allow us to continue to bring all the best action and key moments from The Open to a large free-to-air audience on TV, radio and online.'
