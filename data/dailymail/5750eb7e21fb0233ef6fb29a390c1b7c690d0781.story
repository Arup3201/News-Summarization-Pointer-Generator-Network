The father who allegedly stabbed his girlfriend to death before killing their one-month old baby in the fire he set to cover up the murder showed no remorse during his court appearance on Saturday.

Elitigidio Lynd, who is the main suspect in the arson-homicide that left his girlfriend and daughter dead on Thursday, complained about the way police were handling him since his arrest in the Bronx.

‘Look how they’re treating me!’ he yelled to a New York Post photographer when he was being transported from the NYPD’s 50th precinct.

Investigation: Officers at the scene 
in the Bronx where a 32-year-old woman was found dead  and her one-month-old child unconscious

The 21-year-old man was charged with two counts of murder, manslaughter, arson and criminal possession of a weapon.

He was arrested at a female friend’s 
house after firefighters found the bodies of his girlfriend Louisa 
Rodriguez and their baby Angela in their Kingsbridge home on Thursday 
night.

Police say her mother, a 32-year-old 
woman whose body was found naked beneath a smouldering mattress, had 
been stabbed multiple times and her head bashed before she was dragged 
into the bathroom.

Initial reports claim that Lynd used a machete to attack Ms Rodriguez.

Baby Angela was found lying 
unconscious in an empty bathtub and rushed outside by one firefighter 
who tried to resucitate the infant as he ran her to an ambulance.

The firefighter was seen rushing from 
the burning building with the naked, limp body of the baby girl. The 
child later died at Montefiore Medical Center said NYFD officials.

'The baby was...naked, and just had 
this blank expression,' said Kenneth Delgado, who saw a frantic 
firefighter carrying the infant.

'She didn't look like she was breathing.'

An autopsy later found that the child had been killed after suffering blunt force trauma and had not died from smoke inhalation.

Witnesses, composed of residents and neighbours of the Bronx complex, described the heart-rending scene below.

'They threw her down on the [car] hood
and they gave her CPR then they took her into the ambulance and they 
took her to the hospital,' a young teen told News12 Long island. 'It was
breathing but literally it looked like it was sleeping.’

'My son saw when they pulled out the 
body, he's like mom, they're pulling out the body, I looked and just the
image of her lying there,' a second neighbour reacted to ABC7 while 
choking back tears.

Neighbours said the father of the 
infant, who was two days shy of her one-month birthday, was the victim’s
boyfriend who had been living with her until recently.

They said the couple had had an often violent relationship.

'Last weekend, he was screaming at her,' said one neighbor, Senobio Padilla, 53, to the New York Times.

'I heard him, I couldn’t hear her.'

It emerged that Rodriguez had gone to 
Family Court for an order of protection and had called police at least 
twice in the past, sources said to the New York Post.
