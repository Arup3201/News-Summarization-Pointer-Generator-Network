Gamers have slammed hackers who knocked out Playstation and Xbox networks on the  day millions received consoles for Christmas.

The online networks which allow game players to get the most out of their new machines went down yesterday, leaving many youngsters frustrated and parents furious.

Notorious hacking group Lizard Squad, who had previously brought down both networks earlier this month, claimed responsibility for the sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

As the disruption dragged on into a second day today, many desperate gamers sent messages to the group on Twitter, urging them to return service to normal.

Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service

In one of hundreds of similar messages, Andrew Quintero wrote: 'Could you guys please let PSN back on?'

Others, such as London's Luca Rizzo, turned their anger on the companies, calling on them to improve security.

He wrote: '@XboxSupport when is online going to be back on? This is a joke were missing out on xmas gaming because of a hack! We want answers!'

Microsoft and Sony both used Twitter to acknowledge the issues and to assure users that they were doing everything they could to restore their services.

At 2:30pm this afternoon, the Playstation's network was offline and, while many Xbox Live services were up and running, the service's status was described as 'limited'.

On Boxing Day morning, Xbox support tweeted: 'Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live.'

Around the same time, Playstation's support team posted: 'Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience!'

Hundreds took to Twitter today to complain about being unable to connect to the console's networks

The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4.

Occasional downtime is par for the course for both services, but Christmas Day is a particularly bad time to be hacked, just as hundreds of thousands of PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones were being unwrapped and set up for the first time.

Lizard Squad had first announced earlier this month plans to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day. It described itself as the 'next generation Grinch.'

Another hacker group, The Finest Squad, then emerged, saying that it would stop the group and bring its members to justice. The Finest Squad tweeted at about 5pm ET that they had Xbox 'pretty much restored.'

The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony's decision to let consumers download the controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources.

Lizard squad is a hacking collective who have claimed responsibility for a series of hacks on games networks.

This year the group has been linked to cyber attacks on EA games, Destiny and previous hacks of Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network.

Threats posted after a previous  hack on Xbox Live claimed it wouldn't be the last. They wrote: 'Microsoft will receive a wonderful Christmas present from us.'

Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch'

It had previously been alleged the group used a Russian internet domain, leading to claims they were based in that country.

However, it was claimed online today that they are in fact a group made up of one Canadian, three men from the US and two from the UK.

One of the men from Britain declined to comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline, another was unavailable.

Microsoft used Twitter on Christmas Day to keep gamers updated about the issues impacting on Xbox Live

There was anger on Twitter today as parents and youngsters expressed fury at not being able to use their expensive Christmas presents properly.

Wigan's Christine tweeted: 'Why hack Xbox & Playstation on Xmas day to stop kids playing with there presents....modern day Scrooge'

Another website user added: 'Can't believe people have nothing better to do on Xmas than to hack into Xbox Live and play station network and shut them down'

And IT tecnicial Jon Massey wrote: 'Cant figure out why they would hack Xbox + PSN. Way to spoil the Christmas for the kids who were lucky enough to get consoles...' 

Three Xbox platforms were affected by the service problem: Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox on other devices, Microsoft's status website said.

'I have the nation on strings,' Lizard Squad wrote on its Twitter site. It also said it would put the sites back online if enough people retweeted its messages. 

Sony also used Twitter to keep PlayStation Network users abreast of the issues it was facing

Rival hacker group, The Finest Squad, claimed via Twitter on Christmas Day that they had restored Xbox Live

In the past, Lizard Squad have overloaded both Microsoft and Sony's gameplay services, as well as Blizzard's online gaming network. 

Distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoSing - occurs when massive numbers of people or automated machines flood servers with external data requests, crippling the computers to the point where they grind to a halt and are effectively frozen.

This is what happened when Lizard Squad attacked the Blizzard and PlayStation Network servers in August. 

It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding.

The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones.

Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved.

A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain.
