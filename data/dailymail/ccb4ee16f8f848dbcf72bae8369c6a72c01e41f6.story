Two schoolboys who wrote a song about falling out of love with Peppa Pig have been ordered to remove it from iTunes because it breaches trademark rules.

Joshua Lima, 10, and his brother Noah, eight, wrote the song for their band called Magician's Nephew.

The song titled Peppa Pig and used Peppa includes the lyrics: 'In the playground of our school Peppa Pig is no longer cool.'

The band were initially using artwork featuring Peppa Pig, pictured left, in the video for their song, but they have since replaced it with a broken heart, pictured right

The boys were shocked when they received a legal letter from  bosses at Entertainment One, the company that licences the brand, ordering them to remove the song.

The lyrics to the song are;

My friends have lost their faith

They will scream it to your face

In the playground of our school

Peppa Pig is no longer cool!

We all bought your DVDs

You were the greatest on TV

We had so much joy

You were my favourite toy!

Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig

Why aren't you funny anymore?

Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig

You made us laugh so much before...

Peppa Pig, I'm over you I'm in Year Four

Peppa Pig, I just don't love you anymore*

I don't mean to be cruel

But you're not coming with me to school

The times we shared were fine

Now we need to draw the line

I know this must be hard

And I mean no disregard

Let's go our separate ways

You and me were just a phase!

The letter said that Peppa Pig, which makes around £650m-a-year and is aired in 200 countries around the world, was a 'valuable property' and that the song breached trademark rules.

Joshua and Noah, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, said they were 'amazed' when they got the legal letter last week after uploading the track onto iTunes.

They have now taken the song off the music sharing site, but it is still available on their website.

The boys have also stopped using the picture of the animated pig in their video for the song and have replaced it with a broken heart. 

The pair, who named their band after the 1955 novel by C.S. Lewis, said they wrote the track, after they fell out of love with the porker and his family.

'We never thought this would be such a pig problem,' they reportedly told the Hertfordshire Advertiser.

The boys  performing covers of their favourite songs by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, before starting to write their own songs.

They have been together three years with Joshua on lead guitar and vocals and Noah on saxophone and also providing vocals. 

Other members include Jesse Rist, 16,  Matt Rist, 18, Euan Campbell, 11, and Keeran Richardson, 10. 

On their website they say being in the band has been 'an amazing experience so far.' 

They say: 'When we first started we used to play along with our toy guitars and baby drum kit while the music was playing in the background. It was a lot of fun.

'We have come up with our own style and our songs are about daily things in our lives.'

They play gigs around St Albans, and have been booked to play at St Pancras Station later this year.

They have also written 17 tracks for their album, which is due out towards the end of this year. 

Entertainment One has been contacted by the MailOnline for a comment, but they are yet to respond to the request.
