The circus surrounding Julian Assange’s extradition descended even further into farce yesterday as George Galloway waded into the row.

The Respect MP claimed Assange should not be facing a rape charge in Sweden as he was accused only of ‘bad sexual etiquette’.

In a lengthy diatribe on his video podcast, Good Night with George Galloway, the MP for Bradford West said he did not believe the two women who had accused Assange of rape and sexual assault.

Bad manners: Respect MP George Galloway said Assange should not face a rape charge in Sweden as he was only accused of 'bad sexual etiquette' on his video podcast Good Night with George Galloway

Not rape: Galloway backed Assange against rape allegations made by two Swedish women as the Wikileaks founder spoke on the balcony of Ecuador's London embassy on Sunday

He added: ‘Even taken at its worst, 
if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true,
 and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don’t constitute 
rape.

‘At least 
not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it. And 
somebody has to say this.’

In their Supreme Court ruling, Britain’s most
 senior judges said the accusations made against the WikiLeaks founder 
in the European arrest warrant amounted to rape.

One of his accusers, a WikiLeaks 
supporter, admits she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but
 woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, 
without using a condom.

Mr 
Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had already had sex 
and were ‘already in the sex game’.

He went on: ‘It might be really bad 
manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Do you mind if
 I do it again?”.

‘It might be really sordid and bad 
sexual etiquette, but whatever else it is, it is not rape or you 
bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.’

'Already in the sex game': Galloway said that the way Assange treated one of his accusers, who had consensual sex before allegedly raping her, 'might be really bad manners'

Last night, another supporter of Assange provoked anger by appearing to name one of the alleged  victims on BBC2’s Newsnight.

Craig Murray, 53, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, said the name twice during a debate claiming it was in general circulation, sparking a rebuke from host Gavin Esler.

Mr Murray said: ‘It’s well worth people going online to discover what they can about the allegations… who made them, what the people who made them did afterwards, and look at what happened.’

Mr Esler told him: ‘You should not be naming a potential rape victim.’

Assange denies all the allegations against him but claims he cannot return to Stockholm to defend himself at trial because of fears Sweden would extradite him to the U.S.
