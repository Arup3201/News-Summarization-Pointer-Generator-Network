These are the two ‘petite’ firearms officers set to receive payouts of £35,000 each after complaining their guns were too big for their small hands.

Pictured for the first time, Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles won a sex discrimination case on the grounds they could not reach the trigger.

Now the Mail can reveal the full extent of their claims, including how Miss Giles said she was ‘bullied, victimised and isolated’.

Both claimed their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a Glock 17 - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests.

They also said protective gear was too big for their small heads and legs and they were too short for a wooden barricade used as a resting place for the firearms.

The barricade was built for an officer of average male height and only offered support for those much taller.

The Central London Employment Tribunal found the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) guilty of discrimination against the officers.

It is understood they are to receive £35,000 each, although the force plans to appeal.

The officers were based at different stations – Miss Wheatley, 39, with an armed unit which protects the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria, and Miss Giles, 32, at Chapelcross, Scotland.

They were described as being ‘petite in stature’ and with ‘small hands’, but were ignored when they repeatedly asked for a smaller grip on their weapons, the tribunal heard.

Miss Giles said in a witness statement: ‘All this has led to extreme distress. The stress has caused significant problems to my health.’

Their solicitor, Binder Bansel, of Pattinson & Brewer, said that every officer joining at the rank of constable or sergeant is required to train to recognised standards as an authorised firearms officer and maintain the standard.

A cycle of annual training shoots tests their ability which they must undertake as part of their job.

Mr Bansel said: ‘Continued failure at these shoot days results in an unsatisfactory assessment, which could lead to the officer being dismissed.’ 

The tribunal dismissed any claims of victimisation.

Yesterday, a CNC spokesman said the force was planning to appeal - saying: ‘The judgement has been passed and the CNC has lost on the grounds of indirect sex discrimination, however any claims of victimisation were unanimously dismissed.

‘As a result of what was discussed in this case, the CNC can also state it will be conducting an equality impact assessment.

‘This is to ensure that the CNC remains committed to providing the right training and equipment, together with a commitment to equal opportunities.’

Miss Wheatley and Miss Giles were members of the Civil Nuclear Police Federation, which supported the claim.

The tribunal decision came after a number of extraordinary cases where police forces across the country have had to pay out thousands in compensation to officers due to injuries at work.

In
 December last year it emerged a police community support officer who 
injured her knee while investigating a burglary was awarded £4,000 in 
compensation.

Pauline 
Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call reporting a break-in at a 
derelict school when she fell over a 3ft-high wooden fence.

And in April last year, a policeman was paid £8,000 compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work.

The
 extraordinary injury claim was made after colleagues complained that 
their police station in Birmingham had become infested with the insects.

It
 was one of a number of workplace injury claims paid by West Midlands 
Police which had spent £900,000 settling cases made by more than 50 
policemen in three years.

And
 WPC Kelly Jones triggered public outrage and criticism from her own 
chief constable last year for suing a burglary victim for £50,000 after 
tripping over a kerb.

Other 
claims include a police officer awarded £16,610 in compensation after he
 fell over a pile of blankets while chasing a suspect.
