It costs about as much as your average family runaround - but don't expect to find too many of these on Britain's driveways.

The £10,000 Jaguar Land Rover mountain bike is made-to-measure and coated in the same vapourised titanium used for the London 2012 Olympic torches.

The cycles, which have been named Nitrade, are built by the company at their plants in Castle Bromwhich and Solihull in the West Midlands.

Stunning: The Jaguar Land Rover mountain bike costs at least £10,000 and will be made-to-measure

Each one will be tailored to fit the exact size of the customer and will take around 18 weeks to build.

Experts at Tamworth-based 2x2 
Worldwide finish each bike with a coating of vapourised titanium, the 
same material used in the London 2012 Olympic torches.

Scott
Hillyard, sales director at the Staffordshire company, said: 'This 
coating is only three microns thick - that’s just one fifth of the 
thickness of a droplet of mist.

'The result is that the bike will not
corrode and is virtually scratch proof, with a finish that is lighter 
than paint and which gives unique rider quality.

'A titanium bike has
timeless looks, is understated and above mere fashion, it feels supple,
springy and fast. It flows over the terrain feeding back information to
the rider without sting or vibration.'

The firm, whose luxury 4x4s are a favourite of celebs and footballers alike, recently unveiled a 'super green' hybrid car at a glitzy launch party in Richmond Park.

JLR also announced a £370million investment in its UK production - including upgrading the Solihull plant to produce the aluminium body parts.

Earlier this year Porsche launched its own mountain bike made from carbon which costs around £5,000.

The Porsche Bike RS weighs just 9kg - around the same as a one-year-old baby.

Battle of the Bikes: Porsche also launched a luxury mountain bike earlier this year which costs £5,000

The bike launch comes weeks after Jaguar Land Rover officially unveiled the world’s first all-aluminium 4x4 in London.

The firm is producing the lightweight fourth-generation Range Rover at its Solihull factory and will sell the fuel-efficient vehicle in 170 countries.

In addition, the company has also taken on 1,000 extra workers to increase production.

Features: The £10,000 Jaguar Land Rover bike is twice as expensive as a bike launched by Porsche in January
