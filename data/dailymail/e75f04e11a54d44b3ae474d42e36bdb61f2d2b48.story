Craig Gordon once sweated anxiously in a television studio while Scotland toiled at Hampden to see off one of the smallest nations in world football.

Come Sunday, he sincerely hopes the national side will not put viewers through a similar experience when Gibraltar come calling.

Gordon, then sidelined by a fractured arm, accepted the offer to turn pundit for the evening as Liechtenstein visited Glasgow for a Euro 2012 qualifier in September 2010.

It was a decision he began to regret as Craig Levein’s side entered injury-time facing utter humiliation with a 1-1 scoreline.

Only thanks to a 97th-minute header from Stephen McManus was Gordon spared the most awkward possible piece of post-match analysis.

‘I was in a television studio the night of the Liechtenstein game,’ he recalled. ‘That was a different life I had back then.

‘Towards the end I was sitting there worried what I was going to say at full-time to defend the rest of the boys.

‘So thankfully we managed to grind it out because I don’t know what I would have said if we’d drawn that one.

‘When Stephen McManus scored I jumped out of my seat in the studio because it was hugely important to get that win.

‘That night is a reminder of what can happen in any game of football. It can be difficult and at this level you don’t want to lose a goal to give yourself an uphill task.

‘If you do that it can get edgy so we’re well aware of the need for a fast start on Sunday and a good tempo so we can take care of things.

‘These are the games we have to win and historically it hasn’t been that easy for us.

‘Getting the win is what we have to focus on first and foremost.

‘If we can do that then looking to score a few goals comes afterwards – but winning the game is the main thing.’

Gordon made his first Scotland start in more than four years when he played the first half of Wednesday night’s 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland before being replaced by Allan McGregor.

However, with David Marshall having served as Gordon Strachan’s more regular No 1, he has no idea whether he will form what should be an untroubled last line of defence against Gibraltar.

‘It was great to stand out there and sing the national anthem again,’ said Gordon. ‘You’d always prefer to play the first half rather than the second.

‘It was just good to get back out there, though. It was enjoyable and both keepers got a clean sheet.

‘I don’t know what will happen on Sunday — the manager will decide that.

‘He told us about the Northern Ireland game on Wednesday morning and I’m sure it will be the same again at the weekend.’
