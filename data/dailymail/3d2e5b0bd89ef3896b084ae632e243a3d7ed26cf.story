A skier participating in a charity event for Make-A-Wish Foundation in New Hampshire fell 60 feet to his death Monday after losing control on a trail, police said.

Samuel Moore, 34, of North Conway, died at about 9.30am at the Wildcat Ski Area in Pinkham Notch, in the White Mountains region, after crashing while skiing near the bottom of the Lower Polecat trail in an area known as 5 Corners. 

Investigators said Moore fell and tumbled down the trail before the drop.

State police Det. Belanger Sheldon Belanger said Moore was wearing a helmet when he fell on the trail, which is rated as a beginner slope.

Forty skiers were taking part Monday in the 12th annual 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge charity event for Make-A-Wish. Skiers were to log a total of 48 trail runs to achieve 100,000 vertical feet over the day.

'This is a tragedy to what is traditionally a fun and self-fulfilling challenge for participants and a major fundraising event for Make-A-Wish of New Hampshire,' said Wildcat General Manager Brian Heon. 'My thoughts, and those of Wildcat Mountain and its employees, go out to the family and friends of this man.'

The Make-A-Wish Foundation in the state grants 80 to 90 wishes each year for children with life-threatening medical conditions.

Adventurer: Besides being a skier, Moore was also an avid camper and mountain biker 

Julie Baron, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish New Hampshire, called Moore's death devastating.

'We're all just so deeply saddened by all of today's events,' she said. 'This young man was out there to help kids.'

According to his Facebook page, Moore, a 2003 graduate of Alfred University, worked as a ceramic process engineer in his day job.

Two days before the fateful ski event, the 34-year-old took to his social media page to thank everyone who has donated money to Make-A-Wish Foundation.

'Thanks for the support and wish me luck on 50 runs top to bottom on Monday. 100,000 vertical for a great cause!' he wrote March 7.

A short video posted on Wildcat Ski Resort's Instagram account shows that the 34-year-old participant entered the challenge wearing bib No. 28.

Organizers of the fundraiser stopped the ski event after Moore's death. In the past, the 100,000 Vertical Foot Challenge had raised more than $595,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Hampshire.

In addition to being a skier, Moore was also an avid mountain biker. He is survived by his parents and cousins.
