French police using tear gas have stormed a migrant camp on the French coast where more than 600 migrants were waiting to illegally cross the channel to Britain.

Three people were arrested as they attempted to escape the authorities' crackdown, including two activists from the No Border Network.

Police cars and dinghies blocked road and sea access to the Calais port after they received a court order backing local authorities' concerns over sanitary conditions in the food distribution centre.

Many of those at pictured at the centre today were from countries that had suffered conflict, such as Iraq

The local administration said in a statement that 610 migrants, including 121 children, had been evacuated. They will be questioned and their cases examined individually.

'It began at around 6am. I was inside and the cops came and they blocked all the exits and used tear gas to stop people from fleeing,' said Celine, a 25-year-old volunteer at the food distribution centre.

Camille, a nurse, said about 25 migrants had managed to escape.

Many of them came from countries that had suffered conflict such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan.

In recent days many migrants from this centre have tried to cross the channel on boats or on vehicles

The migrants evacuated from the food distribution centre have been occupying the area for two months

The migrants had been occupying the food distribution centre since police cleared three makeshift camps holding 650 people at the end of May.

French police have been trying for years to dislodge migrant camps in and around Calais.

But the flow has been persistent, with many migrants hoping to hide in trucks or other vehicles crossing to Britain, where they believe conditions are better for would-be refugees than in France.

A spotlight has been shone on the situation in recent days with large a number of dangerous and desperate attempts made by migrants to cross the border.

Yesterday two suspected illegal immigrants squeezed into a rubber toy dinghy were rescued half a mile from the Dover coast in a desperate bid to cross the English Channel.

It is thought they may have been helped by other people amid reports the dinghy was dropped from a yacht which had already sailed some of the journey between France and England.

And last Saturday eight Afghan immigrants had to be rescued around five miles off the port of Dover in the Channel when their RIB's motor broke down after running out of fuel.

The alarm was raised by the captain of a passing P&O ferry which could have run them over and they were rescued from the choppy seas by Dover Lifeboat workers.

Romanian Marian Badea, 29, a ninth man who was in the boat with them, was charged with attempted facilitation. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Folkestone Magistratesâ€™ Court next week.

The eight Afghan nationals who were detained following the rescue are to be deported, said a spokesman for the Border Force.

The Romanian man was believed to have been trying to smuggle the eight Afghans into Britain under the cover of darkness when the 50hp outboard motor ran out of fuel, leaving the boat drifting in force four winds

It was a repeat of a similar incident on June 6 when a Mongolian man was rescued from the middle of the English Channel trying to paddle to England in a rubber dinghy. He was spotted in a 4ft long blue inflatable kayak by a fishing boat eight miles from shore.
