A British woman has found a way to help a convicted murderer on death row  see the world - she  superimposes his face on pictures of famous landmarks.

Kate Hughes, 29, from Liverpool, has been writing to Texan inmate Robert Pruett, whom she believes has been unfairly convicted of murdering both his neighbour and a prison guard, every week since March.

By Photoshopping images of Pruett's head on to popular tourist sites, Miss Hughes has been helping her unlikely pen pal feel like he's travelling the globe.

The senior care assistant, who lives with her mother, has already 'transported' Pruett to Australia, Italy and the Isle of Skye in the hope of providing him with some escapism from his life in prison.

She has created  pictures of Pruett in front of sites including the Vatican in Rome, the Sydney Opera House and  the Liver Building in Liverpool.

Miss Hughes said: 'If somebody had told me five years ago I would have been writing to a man on death row, I would have said,"'Yeah, whatever".

But times have changed for Miss Hughes, who now says she feels like the convicted murderer is a lifelong friend.

Says Miss Hughes: 'I got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he'd always wanted to visit the Isle of Skye and I used an editing app to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island'

'I was so shocked about how much we have clicked. I feel like I've known him forever and he's told me he sees us as really good friends,' the Photoshop whiz explains.

Miss Hughes, who says she prizes herself on being 'a good judge of character', had an inkling her mother would disapprove of the friendship, despite being convinced of her convicted murderer's innocence.

'Even though I knew he was innocent, I didn't say anything to my mum at first about writing to him.'

Luckily for Miss Hughes, her mother was more understanding than she had imagined.

'She's been really supportive since I told her  - she can see he's not a bad person. I am lucky to have her support, but even if she was against it, it wouldn't affect my friendship with Robert. I am nearly 30, after all.

'Some of my friends do worry about me writing to someone who's in jail for murder, but I'm not in any danger.'

Says Miss Hughes of the man on death row: 'Robert isn't in a dark place any more. He is a really positive person and is quite happy in himself.'

'He loves every minute of life. He tries to love the now, tries to be as happy as he can be. He loves to have a laugh, so I always put silly stories or memories in my emails. 

'In one, I told him about getting attacked by a spider that day - just daft things like that.

Despite having virtually travelled the globe together, Miss Hughes and her convict have never met in the flesh, but the Liverpudlian is hoping that moment will come.

'He says he really wants to meet me and I can't wait to meet him. I think when we meet face to face, it'll be just the same as writing to each other. We've got loads to talk about.'

Miss Hughes learnt of 34-year-old Pruett's criminal background, when she saw his story on BBC documentary Life And Death Row.

He was jailed in 1995 at the age of 16, convicted for the fatal stabbing of a neighbour in Harris County, Texas.

Then four years into a 99-year sentence, Pruett was found guilty of murdering a prison guard who was repeatedly stabbed with a sharpened metal rod, and given the death sentence.

Miss Hughes said: 'We never talk about his case, because when I write to him I want to take him out of that reality. 

'We just chat like normal pen pals do about music, films, funny memories and places in the world we would love to see. 

'The only difference is that he'll never get that chance to see them. At least with the pictures I make, he can imagine himself there.

'I got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he'd always wanted to visit the Isle of Skye and I used an editing app on my mobile phone to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island. 

'He wrote back to say he loved it so in my next letter I attached a photo of him superimposed on top of a double-decker London bus, as he'd talked about visiting the city.

'I've done pictures of him with his favourite band Radiohead too, although that was much harder to make as you have these rock stars and then a white-faced convict in the middle in his boiler suit.'

Miss Hughes is also campaigning for her pen pal to be retried after doubts were expressed over his convictions.

Pruett's father, who admitted killing the neighbour, testified to say his son did not take part in the murder and two fellow inmates who testified against Pruett over the death of the prison guard were given reduced sentences.

His execution date was originally set for May last year at the Polunsky Unit prison. But, with the support of the Texas Innocence Project which fights for wrongfully convicted prisoners, he received a stay of execution so further DNA testing could be carried out.

She said: 'After watching the BBC documentary, and doing my own research, it's clear there isn't a scrap of evidence against Robert. 

'From the first moment, I just knew he wasn't guilty, so I took it upon myself to write to him and let him know.'

'Now I've got to know him, I'm even more convinced that he didn't commit these crimes,' she says. 

'I am very passionate about Robert's case. I haven't stopped thinking about it. If we could just get his sentence reduced or get him off death row, it would be a huge triumph.

'An innocent man is going to die and I want to make people realise that he has not done anything wrong. There is not even a pinhead of DNA against him. He just wants a retrial to prove he is innocent.'

Pruett is currently compiling an online journal about his incarceration where entries are published for him via a friend in Switzerland.

He writes: 'Being on death watch and knowing you could be soon executed is intense and there are ups and downs to it, but you don't have to be overwhelmed by it all. Staying present is the key.'
