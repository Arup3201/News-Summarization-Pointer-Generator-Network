A list believed to detail the names of child abuse victims has been found behind a secret wall by police investigating crimes uncovered as a result of the inquiry into disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile.

Officers swooped on a flat above a record shop in Greater Manchester following a tip-off and discovered the appalling roll call scrawled behind layers of wallpaper and plaster, it has emerged.

The list includes the names and ages of hundreds of boys and girls, next to a disgusting ratings system that apparently related to their sexual performance. Some of the names were reportedly boys and girls the paedophiles were planning to target.

Paedophile: Jimmy Savile sexually abused hundreds of young victims from 1955 to 2009

The discovery, which allegedly dates from the 1980s and 1990s, was made by officers from Greater Manchester Police.

They are currently investigating historic sex abuse allegations that came to light following publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into sex offences committed by Savile.

In the era before the internet, paedophiles used secret magazines or groups to share their crimes with fellow sex attackers in the same way some use internet forums now. Criminologists believe that the wall could be an example of such behaviour.

‘It is a boasting system,’ said David Wilson, Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University.

‘Paedophiles are constantly evolving ways of communicating. It is a form of saying, “This is what I’ve done, I’ve done more than you”. It’s about them displaying their own sexual success in being able to abuse these children.’

Police denied claims that the flat was used by Savile or that the names amounted to a list of his victims.

The Leeds-born Top of the Pops host had links with Greater Manchester stretching back to the 1950s, when he managed a ballroom in the city. His first known attack, in 1955, also took place in the city.

Detective Chief Superintendent Mary Doyle said: ‘Last year, Greater Manchester Police received allegations about historic sexual abuse that occurred in the Greater Manchester area. These allegations were made as a result of Operation Yewtree, which was the investigation by the Metropolitan Police into Jimmy Savile.

‘It is important to stress these allegations were not about Jimmy Savile himself and GMP is not carrying out any inquiries directly relating to Savile.

‘The recovery of these names came as a result of an ongoing investigation into the allegations made last year’.

‘This is a live, complex investigation for which we have already made arrests therefore I cannot go into great detail about the status of the investigation.’

Savile’s death, aged 84 in October 2011, prompted a wave of allegations against the former BBC presenter.

A joint police and NSPCC report, published in January, revealed that Savile was one of Britain’s most prolific paedophiles, with around 450 victims of offences over more than half a century.

It said Savile had committed 214 known offences, including 34 rapes, across 28 police force areas.
