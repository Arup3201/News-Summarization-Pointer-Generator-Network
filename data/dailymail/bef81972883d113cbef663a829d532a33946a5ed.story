These CCTV images show the terrifying moment three young people, including a 17-year-old who was 16 weeks pregnant, were threatened in a city street by a teenager with a handgun.

Alex Warren-Lean, now aged 19, approached a man and two girls in Plymouth to ask for a cigarette but when they refused he pulled a pistol from the pocket of his hoodie to threaten them a court heard.

Plymouth Crown Court was told the terrified group told Warren-Lean one of his victims was pregnant and only then did he back away.

Terrified: Warren-Lean only back away when one member of the group - a 17-year-old teenager - told him she was 16 weeks pregnant

The group then ran out of sight and called 999.

Speaking after the hearing, the pregnant woman who didn’t want to be named, said she had been returning from a birthday party at a city centre social club when Warren-Lean approached them.

She said: 'This bloke asked for a fag. We didn’t have any tobacco, and he started getting a bit funny.

'We carried on walking, but he started mouthing off at us. He pulled out a gun on us and I stepped back.

'He was holding it gangster-style and it looked like a real gun to me.

'I was 16 weeks pregnant and I feared for my life and the lives of my unborn baby and the people around me.'

She added that Warren-Lean did leave the group alone when she told him she was pregnant.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Warren-Lean his pulling a pistol on a group of young people was 'plainly frightening, threatening and intended to be so'.

Police believe the weapon was stolen along with replica guns, knives and samurai swords by Warren-Lean and an accomplice during a burglary of a dead man’s home in Plympton, Devon.

Prosecutor Nick Lewin described how Warren-Lean and his friend Andrew Charlton, also 19, broke into a detached house in Plympton on April 24-25 last year.

The owner had died four weeks earlier and his collection of weapons and Zippo lighters were still in the house awaiting probate.

The pair stole two laptops, six lighters, four swords, 12-15 knives and daggers, three replica pistols and an air rifle, which was later found in the garden, the court heard.

Both teenagers’ fingerprints were found at the scene.

Police tried to track down the pair leading to two chases as the teenagers tried to escape.

The first time the duo managed to escape on bikes and the second time involved a high-speed car chase as the boys tried to avoid capture in a van stolen from Warren-Lean’s father.

It was described by an experienced traffic officer as 'one of the most appalling pieces of driving I have ever witnessed'.

Warren-Lean was jailed for 35 months in a young offenders institution at Plymouth Combined Crown and Charlton was jailed for 15 months

Warren-Lean, just 17 at the time, had driven over kerbs, through red lights, ignored no-entry signs and pulled out of junctions into the path of oncoming vehicles.

They were chased by police for up to four miles before the being stopped by a Stinger, which punctured the tyres.

Emma Birt, defending Warren-Lean, said he had been diagnosed with autism aged 12, taken into care and turned to drugs and alcohol, committing offences to fund his addiction.

Julia Cox, defending Charlton, said his mother died when he was 15 and he began self-harming following the break-up of his relationship with his partner.

Two knives from the break-in were later seized from Warren-Lean. The weapon used in the confrontation with the group was never found but Warren-Lean claimed it was just an unloaded BB gun belonging to Charlton.

Warren-Lean admitted burglary, possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and asked for five other offences to be taken into consideration.

Charlton admitted burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC sentenced Warren-Lean to 35 months in a young offenders’ institution.

He sentenced Charlton to 15 months and banned him from driving for 12 months, telling him: 'The time has come when you have got to learn you can’t go on burgling other people’s property.'

His pregnant victim added: 'I’m relieved he is getting time - he can’t hurt anyone else.'
