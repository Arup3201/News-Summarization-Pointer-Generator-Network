Melissa Spencer, 39, was hospitalised after the incident

Excuses, rants, arguments  and even being pelted with the odd water balloon are all occupational hazards.

But this traffic warden paid a high price for simply doing her job when one disgruntled driver apparently took things much further. 

Melissa Spencer, 39, was allegedly knocked over by a motorist in a dispute over a parking ticket.

Witnesses claimed there had been a row between the warden and the driver of a Green Flag recovery van shortly before she was injured.

Paramedics treated Miss Spencer at the roadside following the incident in Southport, Merseyside, on Thursday morning.

Mother-of-two Paula Liddiard, 39, who lives nearby, said: ‘She was on the floor and moving, the driver was pacing up and down the road.’

Miss Spencer was put in a neck brace and on to a stretcher before being taken to Southport District Hospital with minor injuries.

The driver was arrested and taken away for questioning.

Neighbours said traffic wardens patrolled the street twice an hour and even worked on Sundays to catch motorists illegally parking on double yellow lines and in residents-only parking bays.

One said: ‘I’ve even had a ticket myself outside my own home when my parking permit ran out. But I don’t agree with trying to knock the warden down, that’s going too far. They are just doing their job.’

Last night David Eyre, 44, was charged with driving without due care and attention. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said he was due to appear at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court next month.

It is the second time that Miss Spencer has been injured on the job. Two years ago, she was dragged down a street after another driver trapped her arm in their window.

The number of traffic wardens in Britain fell last year, but despite this there was an increase in the number of tickets given out.

A parking fine is handed out every five seconds, with 6.8million issued in 2011, according to information from 71 city councils. That is a quarter of million more than in the previous year and equates to at least £234million in revenue.

Figures released under a Freedom of Information request last year revealed that, since 2006, there have been 24 incidents in which wardens were deliberately hit by drivers, and another four where they were hit by car doors. Others have been pelted with eggs, snowballs, paint and water balloons in revenge for handing out tickets.

In February, Diquyen Trinh, 39, of Stockport, was fined £1,590 and had his licence endorsed with eight points after deliberately driving at a traffic warden, knocking him to the ground, in Crewe, Cheshire. The officer suffered a broken wrist and shoulder injuries.

A spokesman for Green Flag  said of the incident involving  Miss Spencer: ‘We take any road  incident involving our recovery operators seriously. However, as this incident is currently under police investigation we are unable to comment any further.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
