His grieving mother Nicola, 50, had asked mourners to wear something that showed her son's 'sense of style'.

Dozens of friends donned pink hooded dressing gowns - one of the teenager's trademark outfits - including the pallbearers and even the reverend.

Speaking to the gathering of 450 friends, a tearful Ms Lewis said: 'You always had a strong sense of who you are.

'You were determined, adventurous and playful, funny, mischievous and energetic and very caring. You have left a huge gaping hole in our lives and hearts.'

She added: 'Please young people, try to keep yourselves safe, because it is just too hard to lose you.'

Max was a passenger in a red Citroen Saxo which collided with a white Renault Master van on November 15.

Driver Dan Palmer suffered a punctured lung and broken pelvis and had to undergo extensive surgery following the smash, but is now recovering at home.

As well as the dressing gowns mourners wore wristbands which said 'Max Lewis Gone but never forgotten RIP 09/01/1995 - 15/11/2014'

The ceremony contained hymns and bible readings and ended with Rev Renée Coulson donning a matching pink gown before Bob Marley's Three Little Birds was played
