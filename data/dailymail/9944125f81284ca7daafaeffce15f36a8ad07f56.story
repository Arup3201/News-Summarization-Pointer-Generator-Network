When little Leighton's tummy began to swell two weeks ago, her parents took her to the doctor thinking she had nothing more than wind.

But an X-ray revealed the cause of the newborn's distended tummy was a cancerous tumor which grew to the size of a three-pound cantaloupe within weeks.

After a 12-hour operation to remove the 
lump and most of her digestive system, the frail eight-week-old baby will need multiple organ transplants and reconstructive surgery to stay alive.

Her heartbroken parents Keenan and Dave Sanders remain at her bedside at Seattle Children's Hospital in Washington, hoping their precious second child will continue to gain weight and get stronger.

'When I start to take everything in at once, I can't handle it. I can't listen to it,' mother Keenan Sanders told KOMO News. 'It becomes too much when I hear every single obstacle that she faces and will face. It's overwhelming.'

KOMO News reported Keenan Sanders, a mother-of-two, took her daughter to the doctor several weeks ago when she first noticed something was wrong.

Doctors planned to
 wait a few weeks to remove the tumor, but they brought forward the surgery when it expanded from the size of a softball to the size of a 
cantaloupe in weeks.

When the huge bulge was removed, Leighton's weight dropped from eight-and-a-half pounds to five-and-a-half pounds.

Surgeons also removed her gallbladder, intestine, and parts of her stomach and pancreas, which had been damaged by the tumor.

In good news, doctors said the tumor was only five per cent cancerous and are waiting to see if cancer has spread to Leighton's body.

'I had forgotten we had come [to the 
hospital] for cancer in the first place. That became the 
best case scenario, that it’s just cancer,' Keenan Sanders said.

'As long as I have a piece of hope, there’s something I can hang on to. There were a couple days where it seemed her best case scenario was so dismal. It was just crushing.'

While doctors say the little girl's cancer is most likely under control, her road to recovery is far from over.

She will need to undergo further surgeries to close up her original surgical wound and to create a 
drainage system, in addition to multiple organ transplants.

'It seems miraculous to me that they can essentially build a human. That’s the end result we’re hoping for,' Keenan Sanders told ABC News. 'It would be a miraculous normal life considering where she is right now.'

Loved ones have chipped in to help care for the Sanders' four-year-old son, Logan, and a friend has started a GoFundMe fundraising page to help cover hospital costs. More than $23,000 has already been donated.

The Sanders have also shared the story of their 'fighter' daughter on CaringBridge.com.

'Her vitals look really good and she’s breathing very strong, and it’s pretty crazy she’s got this fight in her,' Keenan Sanders said. 'She’s a redhead, so we’re not surprised.'
