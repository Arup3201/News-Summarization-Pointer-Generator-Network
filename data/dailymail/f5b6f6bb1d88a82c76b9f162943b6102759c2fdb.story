Suicidal Freddie Starr says his life is 'ruined' after his arrest by detectives investigating Jimmy Savile's decades of paedophilia and admits 'I want to go and end it all'.

The comedian has hit rock bottom after being arrested earlier this month and banned from being left alone with his own children by social services while the abuse claim against him is investigated.

Starr is accused of molesting a 14-year-old in Savile's BBC dressing room forty years ago, which he denies and says the strain of the investigation is giving him heart problems.

Painful: Freddie Starr was arrested earlier this month amid claims he groped a 14-year-old and says it has made him suicidal

Ban: The 69-year-old can only be with his own children when his fiancee Sophie Lea, 34, pictured right, is with him

'My life is ruined. I feel so desperate at times I want to go and end it all,' he told the Mirror, adding: 'It’s heartbreaking because I’m totally innocent. It makes me feel suicidal. I don’t think I can ever work again – how can I put a comedy face on after this?'

The former television star, 69, was bailed earlier this month and has not been charged with any 
offence.

The comedian was named by Karin Ward who claims she was groped by him at a Savile sex party 40 years ago after appearing on television alongside him.

Starr had denied 
meeting his accuser but a video later emerged of the pair of 
them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’ in 1974.

Warwickshire social services has now ordered he can only spend time with his own children when his 
fiancee Sophie Lea, 34,is with them at their home south of Birmingham.

A council will always act in this way when an individual is subject to sexual abuse claims.

'I’m no sex pest,' he said, 'but right now I can only have supervised contact with my kids.

'If
Sophie goes out I can’t be left alone with them in my own house. The 
way I’m being treated is humiliating. The kids are suffering too.'

The madcap comic says he 
wants 'I told you I was innocent' carved into his tombstone if he dies.

He also has said that in recent times he has been treated like the 'new Yorkshire Ripper'.

Operation Yewtree is the Metropolitan Police investigation looking into alleged offending by the former disc jockey and 'others'.

Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was the first 
to be detained in what is expected to be a wave of arrests of 
celebrities and former BBC staff.
