In a new blow to the family of Australian nurse Noeline Bischoff and her 14-year-old daughter who suddenly died on their dream holiday, Bali police said last night that they were not going to allow the bodies to be flown home until 'criminal activity' has been ruled out.

The new twist in the baffling deaths of mother and daughter from Queensland's Sunshine Coast came as the pair's family were preparing a memorial service to be held on Thursday morning in their home town of Caloundra.

Ms Bischoff, 54, and her daughter died only a few hours after checking into their holiday resort, on the east coast of the holiday island, prompting reports that they had died from food poisoning or an allergy.

Drugs: Some of the items found by police including inhalers and anti-allergy medication in the hotel room in the Padang Bay Resort in Bali

Twenty nine medicines were found in 
their room at the Padang Bai Beach Resort, leading to further 
speculation that if a combination of any of the medicines had been 
taken, this could also have resulted in death.

Their
 family had asked for the bodies to be returned so a post mortem 
examination could be carried out in Australia - but last night police in
 Bali said that request would not be immediately adhered to.

'We
 have received a formal request to release the bodies to the family,' 
said Mr Adnan Pagibu, the chief detective of Karangasem Police, whose 
authority covers the area where mother and daughter were staying.

But he added: 'We have not ruled out criminal activity and we will not yet allow the release of the bodies from the morgue.'

The
 bodies of Ms Bischoff and her daughter, who ate a fish lunch and more 
fish at dinner, are behing kept at the Sanglah Hospital, where a doctor 
said that early indications were that poisoniong from food or 
intoxication from drugs were the most likely causes of death.

'It
 is too early to tell without an autopsy,' said the doctor, adding that 
the hospital could not allow the bodies to be released or returned to 
the family in Australia until police provided a written request from the
 family.

It is understood a request has already been passed to Bali police, who have delayed the bodies' return.

A
 doctor in the northern Australian city of Darwin warned last night that
 delays in carrying out a post mortem examination could mean the cause 
of death will never be known.

Dr
 Malcom Johson-Leak of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response 
Centre in Darwin, said bringing the bodies home to Queensland for an 
autopsy could make it more difficult to determine the cause of death.

'The
 longer the time before the actual autopsy is done and samples taken, 
the less likely you are to pick up low levels of various toxic agents,' 
the doctor told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio.

Police
investigating the sudden deaths of Ms Bischoff, a nurse, and her daughter found 30 different drugs in the hotel room they were staying in. The medications were 
discovered in a toiletries bag and included asthma inhalers, 
over-the-counter pills such as Nurofen and Imodium and vitamins.

Officers
 also recovered Camidryl, a strong anti-allergy drug made in Indonesia 
and Kalmethasone, a medicine administered by injection and used to treat
 severe asthma.

A pack of needles – one of which appeared to have been used – was also in the room at the Padang Bay Resort, in East Bali.

The pair fell seriously ill hours after dining at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant on Friday night.

The 54-year-old, from Queensland, died while being taken by ambulance to Bali International Medical Clinic in Denpasar. Her daughter passed away at the clinic without knowing her mother was dead.

Their family had wanted their bodies to be returned to Australia for post mortem examinations to be carried out.

Relatives believe that both died as a result of fish poisoning, a claim which the Buddha Bar’s management has vehemently denied.

It is understood that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill

The discovery of the medications has 
thrown fresh doubts over the cause of the deaths, but Richard Day, 
Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at St Vincent’s Hospital, says the 
drugs found were common among overseas travellers, describing them as 
'standard medicines'.

'There
 would be a mixture of being cautious and being a health professional, 
more cautious, in addition to having pre-existing conditions of asthma 
and migraines,' he said.

Arrangements
 were being made to fly the bodies home at the earliest opportunity, but
 it could take some time to determine the causes of death, due to the 
discovery of the medications.

'There
 are lots of samples from the vomit, the medicines and the drink,' head 
of Denpasar Police Forensic Laboratory, Agus Budiartha, said.

'Since
 they're all abroad medicines, from the country where they're from, we 
might have some difficulties because it's not what's usually used in 
Indonesia.'

The resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied the claim of food poisoning

Indonesian authorities have suggested 
the mother and daughter died from an allergy and not poisoning, but the 
family insists the pair did not suffer from allergies.

'We've been told it is fish they've eaten,' Mrs Bischoff's brother-in-law, Kevin Bowe said to the ABC.

'We are sticking to that at the moment. That was the report from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).'

The resort's hotel manager, Giovanni Bareato, has denied this.

'It's
 a big fish so we would have eaten the same one,' Mr Bareato told The 
Australian. 'We haven't fallen ill and I know of no one else who has 
fallen ill from the food.'

The
 family is aware that results from overseas autopsies may not be 
recognised by Indonesia's legal system, but say they aren’t looking for a
 criminal conviction.

'We want the truth,' Keryn Bischoff, Nolene's sister-in-law, said.

'We want to know if it was an accident, or if it wasn't an accident. Were they poisoned, or was it something else?'
