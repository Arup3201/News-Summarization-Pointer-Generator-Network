A mother took her ten-year-old son to court to watch the moment a driver was sentenced for killing his father so he wouldn't grow up with 'unanswered questions'.

Lewi Sharp, the youngest of three children, was given permission to attend the hearing after a request from his mother Angela Sharp.

His father Garry was killed when his motorbike was hit by 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin's car on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh.

Ten-year-old Lewi Sharp has been allowed to sit in court to watch the moment a driver was sentenced for killing his father on this road

Lewi listened for more than two hours as 53 pages of his mother’s diary - which told how she had suffered terrible nightmares and flashbacks since her husband’s death - were read to magistrates in Kendal, Cumbria.

The diary also documented how Mrs Sharp, of Flookburgh, Cumbria, had taken Lewi several times to the scene of the fatal accident, where they found remnants of 48-year-old Mr Sharp’s sunglasses and jacket.

Explaining
 her decision to let Lewi sit in the court hearing, she said: 'Lewi and I
 didn’t want any unanswered questions - we’ve dealt with it all together
 and he’s been mature about it all.

'He has had to grow up fast and his life has been devastated.'

Mrs Sharp has hit out at what she sees as the leniency of the sentence handed down to 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin, who was given a community order of 200 hours’ unpaid work and a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving.

He crashed into the father-of-three’s motor-bike on the wrong side of the road on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh.

'He only has to serve community service in a charity shop,' said Mrs Sharp. 'The sentence was insufficient for the value of a life.'

The court was told that on October 24 last year Mr Sharp met his friend Andrew Bell on the A590 at 11.30am before setting off for Sedbergh on his yellow BMW motorbike.

Lisa Hine, prosecuting, said Mr Sharp, who used his bike to travel to work and was wearing a high visibility jacket, was riding at no more than 40mph 70 feet in front of Mr Bell in ‘effectively dry’ conditions.

She said that in a split second Mr Bell could see Elvin, of Godwin Close, Bourne, Lincolnshire, who was travelling with his wife to Milnthorpe, was about to come onto their side of the road.

The gap became narrower and narrower before Mr Bell saw a ‘wobble’ of the car and then heard the impact of the bike and Elvin’s car throwing Mr Sharp over his handlebars.

Despite attempts to resuscitate Mr Sharp, an HGV driver for Milnthorpe-based Canute, he died at the scene at 2.07pm.

Richard Clews, for Elvin, said in mitigation that the former regional manager and distribution manager for Trebor confectioners, whose son has a cottage in Sedbergh, was an ‘experienced driver’ and the accident was caused by a ‘momentary lapse’.

'John Elvin is not a cold-hearted person; he is the same as you and I. He has thought about little else since it happened and it has troubled him deeply,' he said.

Mrs Sharp said in her victim statement.

The sons' tribute at scene where Mr Sharp died. Elvin was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community after admitting death by careless driving

She said: 'Garry’s death is something that has changed our lives forever and we will never forget him. I only hope our story brings it home to other drivers the importance of taking more care on the roads. I would hate for anyone else to go through what we have.'

After the hearing, she said: 'I really wanted him to be charged with dangerous driving because it would have been more for a life. The sentence doesn’t send out a message which will make others think twice about their actions.'

The National Cycling Charity’s Road Justice campaign is calling for tougher sentences and a tougher response to bad driving.

Campaign co-ordinator Rhia Weston said: 'We believe it should be ‘dangerous’ if danger has been caused to someone - too many incidents are classed as careless. We want longer driving bans of five to ten years as well as education.'

Martin Hill, regional head of magistrates prosecutions for the CPS, said: 'John Elvin was charged with death by careless driving after careful consideration.

'The evidence was reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and CPS guidance on charging offences arising from driving incidents.'

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said a review of driving offences and penalties would be carried out by the Department of Transport and the Ministry of Justice in the coming months.

Elvin was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. This would have been 300 hours but Mr Benning said he was ‘obliged’ to give Elvin credit for his early guilty plea.

Elvin was disqualified from driving for two years and will have to reapply for his licence and pass an extended retest when this period is over. He was also ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
