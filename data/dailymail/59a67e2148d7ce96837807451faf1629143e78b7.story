Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is ready to shine a light on his players – with them working hard on the training pitch at night. 

United have submitted a planning application to have floodlights installed on the practice fields at their Aon-sponsored complex in Carrington.

Sportsmail understands the move has been ordered by manager Louis van Gaal as he continues to exert his influence at the club.

The plans are part of United boss Louis van Gaal's as he continues to exert his influence at the club

Van Gaal is known to pay intense attention to detail and he wants to increase options at the training ground.

Wayne Rooney is a self-confessed fan of Coronation Street and may soon find himself out in the Carrington cold rather than snuggled up on the sofa watching the latest drama unfold on the famous cobbles with wife Coleen.

The captain also enjoys watching EastEnders although he may have to get Coleen to record the show for him should the application get the green light.

However, cosy nights in front of the TV could be saved by the impact the plans could have on the local BAT community.

Van Gaal's plans could be scuppered by bats which are protected by UK law

As part of the application, which includes plans for more fencing, United brought in a bat expert to monitor any potential effect on the nocturnal cave dwellers.

Bats are protected by UK law and should the proposals be viewed as damaging to the three species spotted at the rural location, the common pipistrelle, soprano pipistelle and Daunbenton's, it could be knocked back.

The application, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The benefit of the floodlighting is that it will allow for greater use of the training pitches, particularly during the winter months.

'This is essential in enabling the football club to compete with other clubs, both at domestic and international levels. The floodlighting will enhance the usability and function of the training centre, further helping to maintain its world class status.'
