Fernando Torres’ return to Atletico Madrid is being delayed by Alessio Cerci,  who wants to go to Inter rather than swap for Torres' temporary home AC Milan, reports Italian media,

While Spanish papers As and Marca, and Milan Channel, have all been confident an agreement has been made for Torres to return to his first club for the remaining 18 months of his loan from Chelsea, Corriere dello Sport and others say winger Cerci is stalling the deal.

Roberto Mancini has said Cerci is an Inter transfer target and it’s reported the Italian believes a loan move there would be his best chance of a permanent deal away from Atletico. Spanish media have reported Cerci's been warned he’ll spend six months on the sidelines if he doesn’t accept the loan swap arrangement.

If Alessio Cerci goes to the Serie A he would prefer Inter over AC Milan, stalling swap for Fernando Torres, while Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is top of Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri’s transfer wish list

TuttoSport adds fuel to reports that Juventus is making a play for Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri, saying he’s top of Massimiliano Allegri’s wish list.

‘A trequartista wouldn’t go amiss,’ the Juve manager says, and the Swiss attacker who’s struggled to hold down a place at the Bundesliga champions could be the man.

Jose Mourinho is ‘Mr Stubborn’, according to Spain’s Marca, after the Chelsea boss has an apparent dig at Real Madrid while his London side keep a firm grip on the top of the Premier League table.

“Now I have the players I want...I’ve missed that for some time,” he is quoted, with the paper interpreting it as a ‘dart from Mou towards the World champions’ now managed by Carlo Ancelotti. 

Luis Enrique is preparing champions at Barcelona while Marca calls Jose Mourinho 'Mr Stubborn'

Also in Spain, Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is challenged to ‘prepare a champion’, says Mundo Deportivo, as he looks to ‘exploit his assets and provide personality to achieve a more solid team’.

Barca are one point behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid, though Cristiano Ronaldo and Co have a game in hand.

Luis Suarez tells the paper Enrique is not trying to change the former Liverpool striker.

“The boss asks me to be myself,” he says.
