Tom Sizemore has denied ever having met President Clinton or having given him Elizabeth Hurley’s phone number after a recording surfaced yesterday where he was making outrageous claims about his connection to the pair.

The actor spoke out late Wednesday saying that he does not deny that it is his voice on the tape that was released on Radar Online hours ago, but blamed the claims on his use of drugs like crystal meth.

‘I was never at the White House and I never met Bill Clinton,’ Sizemore told HuffPostLive with his lawyer at his side.

Coming clean: Tom Sizemore, seen next to his manager Charles Lago, said that he has never met former President Clinton nor did he give the Commander in Chief the phone number of his ex girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley

Liz Hurley went for large dark sunglasses despite the rainy weather in West London on Thursday afternoon

‘I’m not denying I said these things. I don’t remember saying these things.

‘They're the rantings of a guy that it has been well-chronicled had a very severe drug problem.’

Sizemore, 52, said that he still has not listened to the tape in question- which purports that Sizemore is recorded telling how he went to the White House in 1998 for a screening of Saving Private Ryan while Bill Clinton was President.

In the tape, he alleges that the President cornered him, forced him to give him Hurley’s number, and he overheard Clinton call the model and arrange for a private plane to fly her from Los Angeles to D.C.

Sizemore published a memoir last year wherein he described how he had a three-year affair with his one-time co-star, Hurley, that began in 1992 and ended in 1995- during which time she was also dating Hugh Grant.

Persistent rumours: Elizabeth Hurley and former US president Bill Clinton have an intimate moment at a charity ball in Russian in 2005

He did not have sexual relations with this one either: Bill Clinton and Liz Hurley at the charity ball

Close friends: Liz Hurley appears to have her hand on the former president's back during the dinner in St Petersburg nine years ago

Although these pictures capture the pair sitting close together at the charity event, Mr Sizemore has said he made up the story about the affair between Bill Clinton and Liz Hurley

When news of the tape surfaced this morning, Hurley immediately denied the reports on Twitter.

‘Ludicrously
 silly stories about me & Bill Clinton. Totally untrue. In the hands
 of my lawyers. Yawn,’ she wrote to her nearly 450,000 followers.

Sizemore
 said that he has not spoken to his former flame in regards to the tape,
 and apologized to both Hurley and the former President for bringing the
 issue up.

‘I’d like to apologize to her for any hurt or BS I caused her or the Clintons or anyone else I could have mentioned,’ he said.

‘My perceptions were not the greatest.’ 

Having a ball: The only time the pair were ever pictured was at a November 2005 at a Russian charity masquerade ball at the Catherine Palace of Pushkin

Complete denial: The speculation of an alleged affair began because Sizemore said he connected Hurley (left) and then-President Bill Clinton (right) during a visit to the White House in 1998 which he now says never happened

Setting the record straight: In the past, Hurley has said that she finds powerful men like Clinton 'sexy' but she says the latest claims about them having an affair are false

In today’s interview, Sizemore claimed
 that he was hanging around questionable people during the depths of his
 drug addiction around 2006, and he assumes that one of those people 
secretly taped him saying this outrageous story.

‘It’s an old tape... I wasn’t really willing to be videotaped,’ he said Wednesday.

‘Those were the type of folks I was hanging out with before I went to Celebrity Rehab,’ which occurred in 2010.

He
 went on to clarify that he has never met former President Clinton and 
the only time he attended a screening of one of his films near the White
 House was during former President George W Bush’s administration.

Ramblings: Sizemore, seen here during an interview Wednesday night, said that he has been sober for five years but had a multi-year drug addiction that landed him in rehab

Different era: Elizabeth Hurley, seen today with a friend in West London, was the first party involved in the story to make a public comment wherein she vehemently denied the claims she had an affair with Clinton

Sizemore said that the latest recording- which may have been taken at the same time as an earlier video that Radar released that shows Sizemore smoking from a pipe that is believed to contain crystal meth- is ‘more proof that I wasn’t in my best of shape’.

‘I had fallen into disrepair.

‘I’ve been through a lot and I haven’t been through a lot- it’s all relative.

‘It’s the choices I chose to do back then and they're coming back to haunt me now.’

He said that while he is a Democrat, he ‘not a very political guy’ and did not want to weigh in on any analysis about how this claim would help or hurt Hillary Clinton as she is widely considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016.

‘This shouldn’t harm Mrs Clinton- it's just ludicrous that the ravings of a drug addicted actor have any influence on who should be president,’ Sizemore said.
