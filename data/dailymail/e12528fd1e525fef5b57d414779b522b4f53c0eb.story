Paying a player northwards of £100,000 a week to be an occasional impact sub off the bench is an expensive business, even for a side who have Premier League title aspirations. And, judging by Arsene Wenger’s decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, Theo Walcott seems to have become just that at Arsenal.

Indeed there was, for portions of this match, a sense that Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck could form a clinical strike force in the Premier League for years to come – while Walcott warmed up on the touchline. Yet, even in the second half when things were not going right for Arsenal and they needed a spark to reignite them, Wenger instead turned to Tomas Rosicky ahead of Walcott to give some added impetus.

And, as much as Walcott will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second-placed Manchester City, you can’t help but feel the England forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the Emirates.

Theo Walcott has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over £100,000 a week

Because, put simply, where do you fit him into this Gunners side? Giroud is on fire and is leading the line superbly – he has scored 11 goals in 12 Premier League starts this season after his two at St James’ – Welbeck caused problems all afternoon, contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice, while Sanchez, although visibly tired, was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the Gunners on the front foot. Walcott is not an automatic selection anymore, and therefore he cannot be too ambitious with his wage demands.

Arsenal’s form is superb – they have won 14 of 16 games since New Year’s Day – and they have achieved that largely without Walcott’s presence. The 26-year-old – yes, he is really still that young – has started just three top-flight games all season after returning from injury, and the Gunners haven’t exactly missed him.

Right now the Gunners are playing with pace and panache – displayed perfectly when Welbeck, Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey combined to take Arsenal from one side of the field to the other, only for Mike Williamson to make a timely interception. This was just one example of when Arsenal’s front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first-half display. Yet, despite that, their goals at St James’ Park came from a direct source.

Giroud loves scoring against Newcastle anyway, and now has eight in seven against them, but the way he calmly kneed in his first after Welbeck’s flick-on highlights a player with confidence. His second was also a decent header, although he didn’t even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by Williamson. Unfortunately for Walcott, height and an aerial presence will make Giroud first-choice centre forward every time.

Despite returning from a serious injury, Walcott has struggled to earn a place in Wenger's starting 11

Welbeck offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three, while Sanchez on his day is simply world class. They may not have been at their absolute best against Newcastle, but they got the job done.

But on saying all of that, if Wenger does not offer Walcott a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games’ worth of Premier League experience and 47 strikes in England’s top flight to one of his rivals. Is he really willing to risk that?

Perhaps though, given Walcott’s shocking injury record, Wenger thinks he has replaced one ‘W’ for another – with the £16million acquisition of Welbeck increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the Frenchman.

Will Walcott or Wenger blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the England winger seems to have had with the club? On the basis of Saturday’s match, you get the impression the England striker may be knocking on the manager’s door with his tail between his legs sometime soon.
