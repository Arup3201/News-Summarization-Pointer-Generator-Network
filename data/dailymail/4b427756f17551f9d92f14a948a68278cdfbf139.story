This is a rare glimpse inside the legacy of Father Divine.

A proponent of racial integration in the early 1900s, the radical reverend shook the core of Christianity with his International Peace Mission Movement, based in New York City's Harlem.

Tens of thousands flocked to join the pioneering congregation across the globe, and held that Father Divine was God incarnate.

Following his death in 1965, the church still holds Holy Communion banquets.

But lesser-known is the secluded retreat outside Philadelphia, where Father Divine's 18 most dedicated followers - and his widow Mother Divine - still reside, in an insightful set of photographs captured by Kristin Bedford.

The idyllic French Gothic estate, Woodmont, spans 70 luscious acres of land.

Each day is spent preparing food, setting the table and making arrangements for their banquets.

A place is set for Father Divine, and his followers feel his presence at every meal. 

It was a ritual that fascinated photographer Kristin Bedford, who was invited to the mansion to archive the community's historic photographs.

'For me, photography is about showing up again and again to see what happens,' she told the New York Times.

'It's about following those invisible lines of intuition that take you into places you can't rationally explain. 

'I'm open to walking into things I don't understand, and maybe I'll never understand.

'Through photography, I might get a glimpse of this unknown.'

She attempted to harness Father Divine's ideal of a 'Perfect Picture' that his congregation could achieve if they 'focus their lens', live peacefully, observe celibacy, give generously, and treat all races equally.

'If a follower is able to fully embody his truth, they would be in turn creating "the Perfect Picture,"' she continued. 

'In the photographs, I capture that in the small details of everyday life. They're not making grand gestures to realize Father Divine's vision. They're doing it in everyday ways.'
