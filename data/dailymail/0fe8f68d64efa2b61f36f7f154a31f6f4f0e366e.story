Reshuffle: Mr Justice Charles has been placed in charge of the Court of Protection

A judge who wants to ‘let the light in’ was put in charge of Britain’s most secret court yesterday.

Mr Justice Charles was made Vice-President of the Court of Protection, the tribunal that has been heavily criticised for making life-changing decisions out of sight of the public.

The reshuffle means the Court of Protection will from next month come under the full control of Mr Justice Charles, a family judge who has backed the drive for more openness in the courts.

The appointment, made by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, follows a series of scandals involving the court, which decides on the affairs of people too ill to decide for themselves.

In April it was caught in controversy after the Daily Mail revealed that a Court of Protection judge had secretly jailed a woman over her attempts to get her father out of a care home where she thought his life was in danger.

It was criticised again earlier this month after ordering that a woman who had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act undergo an involuntary caesarean.

Mr Justice Charles has been Judge-in-Charge of the Court of Protection – a non-statutory role – since 2011.

The Judicial Office said in an announcement yesterday that the new appointment ‘will allow him to continue with the work he has begun as Judge-in-Charge’.

The switch also involves the court linking with the Family Division, whose president, Sir James Munby, has been pressing for greater openness in courts.

The Judicial Office said Mr Justice Charles, 65, will use ‘his family background and his extensive experience to support the President’. The judge told a committee of peers last month that there was a ‘historical reluctance’ to publish Court of Protection judgments but this was going to change.

‘To my mind the impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in, more transparency, outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded,’ he said.

Controversial: The Court of Protection, unlike almost any other, is closed to public scrutiny

He added that greater openness ‘would improve the performance of all involved in the court process – I don’t exclude judges from that’.

The switch means that one of the most senior judges, Chancellor of the High Court Sir Terence Etherton, loses the title of Vice-President of the Court of Protection after less than a year.

Sir Terence took up the post of Chancellor, including the Court of Protection role, only in January.
