Paris Saint-Germain are back on the trail of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic but are set to be disappointed. 

The powerful Serb, a cult hero at Stamford Bridge, has opened discussions over a new contract and wants to stay with Chelsea.

PSG coach Laurent Blanc is keen to add a new right back with Ivanovic, Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta and Newcastle's Mathieu Debuchy among his prospective targets.

Indeed Ivanovic was courted by the French champions last summer but he was assured he had a significant role to play under Jose Mourinho and the Portuguese coach has been satisfied with the 29-year-old's contribution to Chelsea's challenge for the Premier League title.

Ivanovic has two years left on a deal worth around £120,000 a week but is expected to revise those terms and extend by another two years if all goes to plan over the coming weeks.

He has figured in 31 games this season and scored the decisive goal in in what could prove a pivotal 1-0 win at Manchester City last week. He is regarded by Mourinho as one of his trusted senior professionals and his influence on the squad will prove all the more important as Chelsea bring in younger players in the summer.

Kurt Zouma, the 19-year-old France defender, is arriving from St Etienne and 18-year-old left back Luke Shaw is expected from Southampton should they successfully fend off competition from Manchester United and City for his £25m transfer.

Chelsea were once again among clubs represented at PEC Zwolle's game against Ajax on Sunday.The Stamford Bridge club were joined by scouts from Manchester United, City and Arsenal as they continue to monitor Ajax defender Joel Veltman.

MailOnline revealed last week that 22-year-old Veltman and his club mate Stefano Denswil were among the centre backs being considered by United in particular as they weigh up prospective replacements for Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.

David Moyes would prefer someone with greater experience but won't let that get in the way of recruiting a player of such promise.

Get to grips: Chelsea have been tracking Ajax right back Joel Veltman in recent months

Described by Frank de Boer as 'Not Veltman but a veldheer (a general)' following a man-of-the-match performance against Celtic in November, Veltman has overcome fears about an old knee injury to show why he is regarded as one of Ajax's finest academy graduates.

Much credit has also been given to his one-to-one coaching sessions with former United defender Jaap Stam.

Underlining a determination to snub all bids though, Ajax director Marc Overmars says the club intend to increase his £9,000 a week wages and extend his contract beyond 2017.

'I will barricade the doors and I will go and stand behind the door myself to stop them from taking him. He means too much to us,' said Overmars.

'Jaap has been working on him really hard with individual coaching at Ajax. He is a massive talent and players have been leaving this club too early in their careers.'

Dinamo Zagreb are trying to see if Premier League clubs can outbid Barcelona in the battle for teenage prospect Alen Halilovic.

Barcelona
 have already had a £3.2million bid rejected in recent days for the 
17-year-old who has been studied closely by Tottenham and Manchester 
United over the past two years and been hailed as a player of even 
greater potential than Luka Modric.

Twinkle toes: Barcelona have already bid for Alen Halilovic, but Dinamo Zagreb want more money for him

The
 Spanish league leaders are due to send a delegation to Croatia this 
week as they crank up the pressure on Zagreb to sell.

They see Halilovic
 as the long-term replacement for Xavi and are ready to give him time to
 develop as the Spanish midfield maestro closes out his career at the 
Nou Camp.

Zagreb chairman 
Zdravko Mamic wants closer to £12m for Halilovic but recognises most of 
that will be offered in instalments. However, that won't stop Zagreb 
asking Premier League sides to make them an offer in the hope of 
triggering an auction.

Barcelona,
 meanwhile, have added FC Basle centre half Fabian Schar to their list of 
potential summer recruits. The Switzerland defender has been 
watched by Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea.

Manchester City are in discussions over signing 12-year-old Kevin Ackermann, which has raised eyebrows at his club IFK Gothenburg.

Ackermann and his family are prepared to move to England after deciding City's academy would be the best place for the youngster's development.

Talking to the Swedish media, IFK academy director Roger Gustafsson said: 'We certainly think it's scary here. It's not a trend we want to see. I understand this opportunity may never come again so I don't want to judge anyone.

'We've been in contact with City and these guys have gone over with our approval and we had a coach who was with them in England.

'I have not heard of clubs looking for 12-year-olds in Sweden before. But the work is going in an entirely different way abroad, especially in the Premier League.

'They're betting harder and harder and taking in all younger players.'

City are also among European clubs keen on Gremio's 17-year-old Brazilian forward Everton who made his senior debut last month. He scored 20 goals for Gremio’s youth side last season.

Arsenal are looking at inviting Djurgardens prospect Filip Tasic back for further trials. The 15-year-old right winger has just completed a short spell at Arsenal's academy and met up with idols Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere.

He told dif.se: 'It was powerful. Ozil is my idol so when I got to meet him, it was incredible. Yet I did meet all the first team players every day at the training ground when they were in, for example, the restaurant and the pool.

'The most sociable was Jack Wilshere. He always came down and talked with the young players and gave advice and tips.'

Seamus Coleman's ongoing improvement at Everton has been attracting admiring glances from far and wide this season. The Republic of Ireland full back has been one of several success stories at Goodison Park this season as he continues to develop.

Arsenal and Manchester United are both considering approaches for the summer, but so are AC Milan. Clarence Seedorf is replacing right back Ignazio Abate and Coleman has been recommended as one to bear in mind.

AC Milan general manager Adriano Galliani said: 'There’s a lot of dialogue between myself and Clarence and it’s clear that when changing the formation, you need new players. In June, we’ll sort out what needs sorting.'

Everton will resist all offers as they look to build on this season's performances and challenge for a top-four place again next year. However, they could be offered a healthy profit on the £60,000 David Moyes paid to Sligo Rovers in 2009.

Manager Roberto Martinez wants to sign Gareth Barry on a permanent deal and will look at the possibility of signing for Romelu Lukaku. He also wants a left-sided centre back.

Southampton are the latest club to show interest in Sheffield United centre back Harry Maguire.

Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already checked on the 20-year-old who has more than 120 appearances under his belt for the Bramall Lane club.

The 6ft 4in England U21 defender also impressed during last week's 1-0 FA Cup victory over Premier League Fulham. His goals are an added bonus and he has six this season.

That in mind, Southampton's scout was among interested observers during Saturday's 2-0 win over Shrewsbury Town.

Liverpool are continuing checks on Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles. Everton, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have also asked about the 20-year-old in recent weeks.

Liverpool are planning to take a closer look at Chesterfield's 6ft 8in goalkeeper Aaron Chapman.

The 23-year-old was signed from non-League Belper Town last summer by Paul Cook, who is keen to get him more experience. Chapman agreed a new two year contract last week and has been loaned out to Conference Premier side Chester for a month.

Bolton have looked at Chapman while Everton have also had him in for a week's training and now Liverpool are willing to let him train with them as they weigh up his prospects of stepping up.

A deal may be unlikely at this stage but Liverpool are in the market for another keeper. They have watched Lee Nicholls at Wigan and Karl Darlow at Nottingham Forest but remain on the look-out.

Former West Ham left back Razvan Rat is in talks over a move to Rayo Vallecano. The Romanian was released from his contract last month and is a free agent. Talks are progressing over a short term deal for the 32-year-old.

Meanwhile, QPR are keen to take Ravel Morrison on loan from West Ham. The 21-year-old has a groin injury but Derby and Leicester are also keen.

Nottingham Forest are showing interest in Wales striker Simon Church at Charlton. The 25-year-old has scored seven goals in all competitions this season including one for Wales against Macedonia and the winner against former club Huddersfield in the FA Cup.

Manager Billy Davies is weighing up various alternatives to help boost his side's goal return in their push for promotion.
