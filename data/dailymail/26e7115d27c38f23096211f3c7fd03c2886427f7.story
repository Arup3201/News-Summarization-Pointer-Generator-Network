Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's former television wife, was today attacked by a lawyer for his alleged victims after for defending the star.

Rashad was reported as saying: 'Forget these women. What you are seeing is the destruction of a legacy and it's a legacy that is so important to the culture.'

But fire-brand lawyer Miss Allred hit out, branded her defense of the 77-year-old star 'pathetic'. 'Phylicia, I vow to you that I will not forget these women, because women matter. They deserve respect and dignity. Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid "attack dogs" who are trying to undermine them in any way.'

She added: 'Predators have no right to prey upon women, to drug them, to sexually assault them, to hurt them and to target them, humiliate them and force them to endure physical and emotional pain.'

Rashad played Claire Huxtable, wife of Cosby's Dr Cliff Huxtable, in the Cosby Show.

Attack: Attorney Gloria Allred (center) today came out fighting after his on-screen wife, Phylicia Rashad, defended the comedian over allegation after allegation that he drugged and raped women

Phylicia Rashad (pictured with Cosby in 2011) came out to strongly defend her former co-star Bill Cosby against sexual assault allegations, in an interview published on Tuesday

Telling Phylicia that Cosby's legacy 'is destroyed', with no one to blame but himself, she added: 'Phylicia, if anyone did to you or to your daughter, your sister or your mother, what Cosby is alleged to have done to these women, I have no doubt that you would [not] be saying "Forget these women". Instead you would be supporting them.'

Attorney Gloria Allred today introduced three more alleged victims of comedy legend Bill Cosby and said 'numerous' others have contacted her but choose to remain anonymous.

The women – all of whom haven't spoken before – take the number of victims who claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by Cosby to more than 30.

Sitting next to Miss Allred at her LA offices the three women broke down in tears as they told of allegedly being attacked by the star.

Two of them claim they were drugged and raped by Cosby while the third said she was drugged and sexually assaulted.

Miss Allred said the women were allegedly attacked when they were 'young and extremely vulnerable' and have come forward despite moves by Cosby to discredit previous victims.

Even more: Linda Kirkpatrick (second from right) and the two other new victims spoke at the press conference in Los Angeles

She said recent reports indicated Cosby has spent thousands of dollars to hire investigators to try ti find ways to discredit some of the alleged victims.

But Miss Allred said of her clients: 'The three women who are with me here today have decided that they will not be intimidated by Cosby's money, fame and power and they will have the courage to speak out today about what they believe was the victimization of them.'

During the press conference Miss Allred also slammed Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's former television wife, for defending the star.

She added: 'Predators have no right to prey upon women, to drug them, to sexually assault them, to hurt them and to target them, humiliate them and force them to endure physical and emotional pain.'

Telling Phylicia that Cosby's legacy 'is destroyed', with no one to blame but himself, she added: 'Phylicia, if anyone did to you or to your daughter, your sister or your mother, what Cosby is alleged to have done to these women, I have no doubt that you would [not] be saying "Forget these women". Instead you would be supporting them.'

Tonight Cosby is expected to take to the stage in Ontario Canada to perform his comedy show.

The promoters of Cosby's three performances in Canada announced that they would go ahead with the shows despite the controversy.

But women's rights leaders have organized protests outside the venues tonight tomorrow and Friday.

Miss Allred said: 'What happened to these women is no joke and I don't think any of this is a laughing matter and I would hope that no one would be in essence subsidizing Bill Cosby's defense by buying tickets to his show.'

Miss Allred said that none of the new accusations fall within the statute of limitations for a civil or criminal action against Cosby.

But she reiterated that she has told Cosby's representatives that the star could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court.

She has previously challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them.

Miss Allred even invited Cosby's wife Camille to come to her office to meet with the alleged victims personally adding that more women would 'find their voice' and come forward.

She said: 'The end goal is as much justice that is possible under the circumstances.'

Before Christmas Miss Allred introduced three other alleged victims of Cosby but when asked how many women she now represents, including those who choose to remain anonymous, she said: 'I've not kept count.'

The three alleged victims Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal (not her real name), and Kacey (no last name given) all shared strikingly similar stories of their encounters with Cosby.

And they all say it was the fear of retaliation that prevented them from speaking out sooner.

Blonde Kirkpatrick says she was drugged and assaulted in 1981 when she was 25, after playing in a tennis tournament against Cosby in Las Vegas.

The star invited her to his show after the tournament, where he gave her a drink which she said tasted ‘terrible’.

‘I knew something was terribly terribly wrong with whatever I had consumed in the drink he gave me,’ she says.

The next thing she recalls was being back in Cosby’s dressing room.

‘I was lying down. Cosby was on top of me kissing me forcefully. I had no interest in sex of any kind with Bill Cosby.’

She added: ‘I recall seeing a silver bracelet with CAMILLE (Cosby’s wife’s name) on it. I remember thinking why is he doing this to me even while wearing his wife’s bracelet.’

Kirkpatrick says Cosby called her the next day to apologize, and that he invited her back to his show.

He allegedly assaulted her again that night, using force instead of drugs, since Kirkpatrick says she was careful not to drink anything that time.

She said Cosby ‘grabbed’ her from the front, ‘locked me in an aggressive hug, with his arms wrapped around my back and forcefully tried to kiss me. He held so tightly against my body that it was obvious he was sexually aroused.

‘I said “Stop it. No. Let me go”, and managed to get myself out of his grip and pushed him away.’

Lynn Neal, who was wearing a black baseball cap and spectacles, says Cosby assaulted her sometime between 1982 and 1983 when she was in her twenties.

She says he drugged and raped her at one of his shows after meeting her at a health club where she worked.

She says Cosby took her to dinner and made her down a shot of Stoli vodka before taking her back to his dressing room.

‘When we entered the dressing room I sat on the couch and he started taking my pants down. I said what are you doing, stop. But he didn’t and I was weak I felt helpless and I couldn’t stop him.

Neal claims Cosby raped her before rushing her out of his room.

‘He drugged and raped me. He betrayed my trust and took advantage of me.’

She added: ‘I know that there are people out there who know what this man has been doing all these years.’

The third victim Kacey, who didn’t give a last name, recalls that Cosby assaulted her while she was working as an assistant to one of his agents, Tom Illius, at the William Morris Agency between 1990 and 1996.

Kacey said she considered Cosby ‘a father figure, or a favorite uncle’ at the time.

He invited her to lunch at his suite in the Bel Air hotel in LA one day, where he allegedly forced her to take ‘a large white pill.’

Brunette Kacey says she tried to refuse the pill but Cosby asked her ‘would I give you anything that would hurt you? Trust me it will just help you relax.’

She even says Cosby made her open her mouth and move her tongue so he could check she swallowed it.

She says after consuming the pill she woke up to see him naked in bed beside her. She quit her job shortly after.

Breaking down in tears she told the press conference: ‘For those who will choose not to believe that I am speaking the truth of what happened to me, please know that I wish it were not true, but I lived it and know that it is true.’
