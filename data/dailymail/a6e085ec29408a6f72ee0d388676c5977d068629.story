Spozhmai, the 10-year-old Afghan girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint last week, has said her father and brother forced her into it

A ten-year-old girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint in Afghanistan wearing a suicide vest has said how her father and brother forced her to do it.

The girl, named as Spozhmai, has said her relatives beat her before telling her to put on the vest.

She says she was treated like a slave at home, and forbidden from learning how to read and write.

Spozmai, who is thought to be the sister of a prominent Taliban commander, says her father has ordered her to return home but that she has refused.

Speaking to the BBC, she added: 'I said: "No, I will kill myself rather than go with you."'

'The same thing will happen again. They have told me before: "If you don't do it this time, we will make you do it again."

'I did all the things at home, I cooked, I cleaned the whole house, and they would treat me badly as if I was a slave.'

The case first came to light last week when the Afghan Interior Ministry said police had apprehended the young girl who had intended to carry out a suicide attack against Afghan border police in southern Helmand province.

She was said to be in a state of shock and confusion at the time.

In a statement, the Interior Ministry said the girl claimed her brother, a local Taliban commander, had sent her on the mission.

According to spokesman Sediq Sediqi, one of the Afghan soldiers spotted the girl wearing a suicide jacket.

But she was arrested before she could carry the attack as she struggled to operate the detonator.

The girl has now been transferred to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.

In 2011 an eight-year-old girl died 
after she was tricked into carrying a concealed bomb close to a police 
vehicle, where it was remotely detonated.

She claims her father has demanded she return home and says he will force her to put the vest back on

The
 incident occurred in a remote village called Uwshi, in the Charchino 
District, said Fazal Ahmad Shirzad, the police chief of Uruzguan 
Province.

In July it emerged that Taliban 
insurgents in Afghanistan are bribing starving children as young as 
eight years old to plant deadly roadside booby traps, be decoys in 
ambushes and even act as suicide bombers.

Despite the 
Islamic fundamentalists’ claim they have no children in their ranks, 
extremists have been actively recruiting orphaned and homeless young 
boys and training them to use guns, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) 
and suicide vests.

In 
return, they ply the desperate youngsters with sweets and chocolate, an 
investigation for Channel 4’s Dispatches programme learned. 

Afghan orphan Neaz told how he was 
just eight when he was promised a handful of coins by Taliban fighters 
to convert him to their cause.

Allegations: The Taliban have refused  to accept responsibility and claim they have no children in their ranks

The boy had been tending his father’s 
flock of sheep when coalition forces bombed his village.

‘The
 Taliban were hiding in our house when a helicopter came and bombed us,’
 he said. ‘My father was hit in his heart and his head, he was torn 
apart. My mother was hit in the chest and died. I have no one.’

In
 the immediate aftermath of the raid, Neaz was kidnapped by Taliban 
leaders and taken to a nearby town and shown how to use guns and make 
IEDs.

They plied him with sweets and he was initially delighted when 
they said they planned to bring him an extra-special gift – a suicide 
vest packed with bullets and grenades.

‘They
 made me try it on. The grenades went all around my body and then they 
offered me the coins [50 Afghanis – about 60p],’ he said. ‘They told me 
to blow myself up at a checkpoint. I asked what I’d do with the money if
 I had to blow myself up. But they kept encouraging me, telling me that 
if I did it I would go to heaven.’

He finally escaped and walked nine 
miles to turn himself in at a police station. Now aged ten, Neaz lives 
in an orphanage in Lashkar Gah.

Other
 children are less fortunate. There are 224 children in prisons in 
Helmand and Ghazni, arrested by government forces for planning or 
carrying out attacks.
