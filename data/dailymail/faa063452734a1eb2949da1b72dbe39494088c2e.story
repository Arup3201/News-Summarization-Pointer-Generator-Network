It may not be the most serious of life’s problems, but an incredibly irritating one nonetheless – getting a pop song ‘stuck’ in your head, playing over and over.

And much like for a bout of the hiccups, there seem to be few cures for ‘stuck-song syndrome’. Even listening to other music can fail to expel the offending tune which, ironically, tends to be one we didn’t even like much in the first place.

Now scientists believe the phenomenon, technically known as an ‘earworm’, could have a remedy after all.

Two of Lady Gaga's hits Alejandro and Bad Romance are most likely to get stuck in your head

Beyonce is also guilty of making songs that get stuck in your head, particularly her hit Single Ladies

They found that solving a simple verbal puzzles, such as anagrams, forces the annoying music out of our working memory.

Researchers at Western Washington 
University played catchy pop songs to volunteers and then gave them 
puzzles to work on. They found these made the ‘earworms’ disappear – 
with simple five-letter anagram puzzles, giving the best results.

While Sudoku could help also stop annoying tunes getting stuck, the puzzles had little effect if they were too difficult.

And any word games that were too tricky could also allow the irritating melodies back in, the experiments revealed.

Dr Ira Hyman, a music psychologist 
who conducted the study, said: ‘Verbal tasks like anagrams or reading a 
good novel seem to be very good at keeping earworms out.

However, he added, the key is to find
something that will give the right level of challenge, where there is 
not much space left in the brain.

‘Something we can do automatically 
like driving or walking means you are not using all of your cognitive 
resource, so there is plenty of space left for that internal jukebox to 
start playing. You need to find that bit in the middle.’

The researchers also found the most 
common earworms tend to be popular songs that are in the charts or are 
particularly well known.

They found Lady Gaga was the most common artist to get stuck, with Beyonce and The Beatles close behind.

The most catchy songs were: Alejandro and Bad Romance by Lady Gaga; Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen; Single Ladies by Beyoncé; She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand by The Beatles; SOS by Rihanna; You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift and Waterloo by Abba
