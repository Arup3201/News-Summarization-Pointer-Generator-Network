The 'ghost' of one of Australia's most notorious criminals is still lurking within the walls of his old jail cell in Melbourne - or so a group of frightened lawyers have been led to believe.

A recent group of visitors were recently tormented by what they believe to be the voice of Mark 'Chopper' Read, who died last year at the age of 53, during a ghost tour of the now desolate Pentridge Prison.

It was in this prison that the notorious Read had both his ears chopped off by a fellow inmate back in the late 1970s.

Lantern Ghost tour guide Jeremy Kewley said he was leading the group of lawyers around the historic prison when they heard a loud man bellow out near Read's cell 16 in D-Division of the prison.

This startled not only the lawyers but Mr Kewley himself as he initially thought it was a prank by one of the visitors.

'Suddenly came this incredibly loud and aggressive male voice basically screaming out "GET OUT",' Mr Kewley told the Today Show.

'We just sort of froze.'

Shortly after, the same voice yelled out and repeated again 'GET OUT!'.

'It scared the holy crap out of me,' Mr Kewley said.

'I had to assure the group that this was not part of the tour.'

He said police searched the entire building but could not ascertain where the voice came from. He is adamant that this has never happened before.

Mr Kewley also alleges that other group tours sighted an apparition that resembles Read in this very cell

Prison Pentridge was an Australian prison built in 1850 and closed in May, 1997. Other notable prisoners include bush ranger Ned Kelly and Ronald Ryan who was the last man to be executed in Australia

Mr Kewley also alleges that people from other tour groups claim to have seen an apparition that resembles Read, who was behind bars from 20 to 38 years of age.

Read, who's been convicted of a long list of crimes including assault, arson, armed robbery, kidnapping, firearm offences and impersonating a police officer, died of liver cancer in October last year.
