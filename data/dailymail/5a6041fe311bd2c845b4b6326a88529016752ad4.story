Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says that Chelsea will not sell striker Fernando Torres, despite signing Diego Costa and Didier Drogba.

The 30-year-old Spanish striker was initially signed as a long-term replacement for Drogba, but after failing to impress, Torres may now find himself behind the Ivorian who has returned for a second spell at the club.

But Mourinho insisted Torres still has a role to play with the club. Speaking to Sky, the former Real Madrid man said: 'Three strikers is fundamental in the squad and we have three - Nando, Didier and Diego.

'We have a good squad, the perfect squad would be with these 18 players, not 17.'

When pushed about the Spaniard's future at the club Mourinho said he would not be sold 'for sure'.

Chelsea have sold Demba Ba and 
Romelu Lukaku and released Samuel Eto'o this summer, leaving Torres, Costa and Drogba as options 
for the west London club.

Mourinho did admit that he would like to add more English players to Chelsea's squad, but revealed there were no developments on that front yet.

He said: 'We are working hard to have more English players in our squad but at the moment we are still in the middle of that process.'
