Eleven teenagers - including a 15-year-old girl - have been arrested on suspicion of raping a 43-year-old woman.

Emergency crews rushed to the victim's property in Anfield, Liverpool, to reports that a woman had been subjected to a sexual offence.

Officers attended the scene, on Ullswater Street, located less than half a mile away from Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium, before the victim was taken to hospital in a distressed state.

Ten males and a 15-year-old girl have since been arrested in connection with the alleged attack, which took place at around 4.20pm on September 24, and have been bailed pending further inquiries.

An 18-year-old man, two 13-year-old males, a 16-year-old male, two 15-year-old males, a 12-year-old male and a 15-year-old girl, all from Anfield, were arrested by police.

A 15-year-old male, from Walton, a 13-year-old male, from Old Swan, and a 19-year-old male, from Everton, were also arrested in connection with the attack.

Specialist detectives from the force's Matrix Serious Organised Crime unit are now appealing for anyone with information about the attack to come forward.

Detective superintendent Tim Keelan of Merseyside Police said: 'The victim has been distressed by her ordeal and is being supported by specialist officers.

'This was an appalling attack on a woman in her own home and we would urge anyone who has information, which could help us bring those responsible to justice, to come forward.

'It is possible that some of those who were in the flat on the day may have talked to people, including friends or family, about what happened and if they have we would urge them to contact us.'
