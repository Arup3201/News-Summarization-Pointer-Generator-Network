The convicted sex offender wept Monday in court as the tortured girls, now adults, spoke in court about how their father destroyed their childhood.

'You have changed my life forever,' one daughter said, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. 'You robbed me of my childhood... I have lived in fear but I will no longer.'

His sister-in-law also spoke in court about the evil man - she was raped 20 years ago when only 18-years-old and more than five months pregnant.

'I am grateful I can stand here today as one of his survivors,' she said. 'Back then I was the coward, but I'm not a coward anymore.'

Their attacker apologized for his horrific crimes after the families of Ms Pemberton and Ms Adkins also spoke.

'I can't describe the regret and shame I have for what I've done,' he said. 'I wish I could bring your daughters back.'

The predator then wept again as his sentence was read aloud in court - life in prison without parole.

Day in court: Elias Acevedo, shown here during a previous court appearance, pleaded guilty Monday to 297 counts including murder, rape and kidnapping

Confession: Elias Acevedo has confessed to raping and killing two women in the mid-90s

He has agreed to work with the FBI to help prevent crimes similar to his from happening in the future, according to the Plain-Dealer.

Mr Acevedo initially landed in court after being charged 
with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton who
 was found strangled in 1994, and Christina Adkins, who was 18 and five 
months pregnant at the time of her disappearance in 1995.

He initially only faced charges in those cases, but investigators soon discovered he had raped several more victims. including underage children - he faced hundreds of counts by the time the investigation was concluded.

Monday's guilty plea finally brings some level of closure to the families of Christina Adkins and Pamela Pemberton.

Acevedo lived on the same block as sadistic Castro during the 1990s. Castro died while serving a life sentence, plus 1,000 years, and was found with his trousers round his ankles after dying while indulging in auto-erotic asphyxiation.

Following the discovery of Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, who had been missing for 10 years, languishing in the basement of Castro's home, there was a renewed focus on missing persons cold cases.

'Because the public became more aware and investigators were determined and relentless, people were re-interviewed and there was an increased interest in these missing person cases,' FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said.

When police questioned Castro's neighbors, it was discovered that Acevedo was a convicted sex offender and hadn't reported his address to police.

Acevedo was arrested on June 11 in connection with a 1993 rape case after a rape kit taken at the time was tested for DNA evidence.

According to Cleveland.com, the woman Acevedo raped in 1993 was his brother's common-law wife.

She dropped the charges against him because he had seven children and twins on the way at the time.

Tragic: Christina Adkins was 18 and five months pregnant when she was murdered by Acevedo

When detectives spoke with her about Acevedo this year, they were able to start building up a profile of his behavior, which involved strangling, keeping the underwear of his victims and a tendency to return to certain geographical areas.

The 1993 rape occurred close to the spot where his neighbor Pemberton's body was found in 1994.

Pamela Pemberton was found dead in a field on West 11th Street, near Clark Field, by three youths going to school October 24, 1994.

Homicide detectives said Pemberton had been strangled and was found naked.

She had been going to meet a friend at a bar and never returned home.

Acevedo was then linked to the 1995 disappearance of Adkins, who was last seen close to Acevedo's home.

A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said that Acevedo has confessed to the murders, which means authorities will not seek the death penalty.

The Guardian reports that Acevedo led detectives to the spot where he dumped Adkins' body in a manhole under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio cityâ€™s west side.

Remains recovered from the manhole were sent for DNA testing and test results today proved the remains were those of Adkins.

Acevedo has a long criminal history that dates back to 1988, including theft, receiving stolen property and a 2003 rape and kidnapping case for which he served three years in prison.

The 293-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, charged Acevedo with aggravated murder, as well as 173 counts of rape, 115 counts of kidnapping and one count of gross sexual imposition.

Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were all kidnapped by Ariel Castro after accepting a lift from the sadistic abuser.

Once at his Cleveland address, they were subjected to a decade of torture, rape and emotional abuse which involved them being confined to a darkened room and treated like animals.

The girls escaped on May 6 this year after Miss Berry realized that when leaving the house, Castro had forgotten to lock the inside door.

Amanda Berry: Miss Berry was taken by Castro a day before her 17th birthday on April 21 2003.

The last person to hear from her was her sister, when she called to say that she was getting a lift home from a local Burger King.

Amanda was subjected to years of sexual abuse by Castro, and gave birth to his child in December 2006.

Michelle Knight: Miss Knight was 21 when she was abducted by Castro after leaving her cousin's home.

She left behind a young son, and after her rescue police admitted that they spent limited resources in the search for her.

Gina DeJesus: Miss DeJesus was 14 when she was last seen by her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene on April 2, 2004.

In a twist of fate, while studying to become a journalist, Castro's son Anthony interview Miss DeJesus' mother about her disappearance in 2004.
