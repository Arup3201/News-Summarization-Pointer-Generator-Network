A Brisbane juror faces two years jail time after the Supreme Court was forced to abandon the murder trial of Lawrence Alfred Gaskell, after it was found the juror committed a criminal offence by using Facebook to conduct their own investigation into the murder.

Lawrence Alfred Gaskell, 72, has been charged with the murder of his ex-wife and the mother of his children, Katarina Gaskell on October 17, 2011.

The trial judge discharged the jury when it was revealed one of the 12 jurors researched the victim and the suspect, allegedly using Facebook and the Internet to search for additional details on the suspect and the victim.

Katarina Gaskell, 62, was killed when she was bashed with a hammer in a Brisbane home in 2011. Mrs Gaskell died from the injuries hospital the day after she was attacked.

The Supreme Court has been forced to abandon the murder trial of Lawrence Alexander Gaskell after it was discovered one of the jurors committed a criminal offence by using Facebook to search for information about the suspect and the victim.

Under Queensland law, it is a criminal offence for a person who has been sworn in as a juror to investigate the defendant before the jury has come to a verdict

According to Queensland law, it is a criminal offence for a person who has been sworn as a juror to make inquiries about the defendant in the trial before the jury has reached its verdict.

The juror faces a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.

The trial judge was allegedly made aware of the breach of conduct after the offending juror confided in his Internet activity with another member of the jury.

The two-week hearing was in its tenth day, with the jury preparing to leave court to deliberate and come to a verdict.

With the current trial aborted, Gaskell will be tried again later in the year.

The Supreme Court of Queensland (pictured) were forced to abort the trial and must now decide if they will prosecute the juror who independently investigating the trial, before coming to a verdict with the jury.

On Wednesday, Justice Jean Dalton dismissed the jury and ordered a transcript of the juror's Internet activities.

The information will be referred to Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie, who will decide if the juror will face prosecution.

Mrs Gaskell was bashed with a hammer at a house in Zillmere, in suburban Brisbane, and died from her injuries in hosptial the following day.

Gaskell has pleaded not guilty to the murder, admitting to 'cutting his wife with a knife and bashing her with a hammer.' Gaskell claims that he was acting in self-defence.

The couple divorced in 2009 and the court has been told that Mrs Gaskell moved next door, to a property that the couple owned. A legal battle ensued between Lawrence and Katarina Gaskell, disputing the ownership on the property.

In late August 2011, Mrs Gaskell's new partner moved into the home.

Gaskell must be tried again in a new case later in the year, after the Supreme Court was forced to abandon the case, which was nearing completion.
