An Irish golfer says giving up Coca-Cola has ruined his athletic performance.

Peter Lawrie has fallen down the golf league tables in recent years, and has blamed his slump in form on the fact he gave up drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day.

The Irishman was ranked No 105 in the world rankings in October 2010 but is now sitting at a lowly position of No 726.

And Mr Lawrie claims this was because he went from drinking litres of fizzy drinks to just a few cans.

Peter Lawrie says quitting an 'addiction' to Coca-Cola has affected his athletic performance. He claims he has seena slump in form ever since he stopped drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day. He is pictured in action during the third round of the Maybank Malaysian Open last week

A 330ml can of Coca-Cola contains 35g of sugar, the equivalent of almost nine teaspoons. It also contains 32mg of caffeine, a third of the amount in a mug of instant coffee

Mr Lawrie, 40, told Irish radio station Newstalk: 'I cut it out completely and went from such a high on sugar to a dramatic low. I never recovered.

'I lost all confidence in myself. I wouldn't say I went through a breakdown but I definitely got exceptionally emotional.

'It was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me.

'Whether that had anything to do with my mental state in any shape or form, I have no idea.

'I drink two or three cans a day [now] but I was drinking litres of the stuff. 

'Even in the hottest country, like Malaysia, I'd have a Coke on the golf course because I was addicted to it.' 

Coca-Cola contains 53g of sugar per 500m bottle.

This means if that if Mr Lawrie was drinking two litres a day, he would be consuming 212g of sugar a day.

Peter Lawrie said he was drinking several litres of Coca-Cola a day.

ONE litre of Coca-Cola contains: 

106 g sugar: the equivalent of 26 and a half teaspoons

420 calories: 17 per cent of an average man's daily recommended calorie intake and 21 per cent of a woman's. 

106 mg caffeine, the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee. 

Chris Cashin, chair of Sports Dietitians UK, said Mr Lawrie would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day.

She told MailOnline: ‘Coke has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing. It’s a stimulant, it makes you more alert.

'It can enhances fatty acid tissue, so it aids recovery too.’

‘If you have caffeine withdrawals that can affect you mood, concentration and athletic performance.’

‘Cutting all that sugar out could certainly have caused a dip in Mr Lawrie's mood.'

She added: ‘Normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight. He’s burning off the calories because he’s very active.

‘In some people drinking that much sugar, there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance.’

Another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay, she said.

She added: ‘Anecdotally, clients who drink a lot of Coke complain of heartburn. 

'It’s very acidic. I buy it to clean my jewellery. If it’s able to strip dirt off gold, imagine what it’s doing to your insides.’

That’s the equivalent of 53 teaspoons of sugar.

It’s also more than double the recommended amount of sugar (50g) that an adult should eat in a day, according to current guidelines from the World Health Organisation.

Sugar should account for no more than 10 per cent of the calories in the diet, or around 12.5 teaspoons.

However there are plans in the pipeline to halve this recommended daily amount to just 25g, or around six teaspoons.

Chris Cashin, chair of Sports Dietitians UK who has worked with several professional golfers – and other athletes – agreed that Mr Lawrie would have been consuming high levels of sugar and caffeine if he was drinking litres of Coca-Cola a day.

Stopping suddenly could have plausibly caused a dip in his mood and performance if he wasn’t replacing the carbohydrates he had been previously been drinking, she said.

She told MailOnline: ‘Cutting all that sugar out, could certainly have caused a dip in his mood.

‘He didn’t specify whether he was eating food as well, so it may have been he was getting all his carbohydrates from Coke. 

'I would far rather athletes get their carbs - which play a role in mood regulation - in the form of potatoes and wholegrain pasta, for example.

‘Normal people who drink fizzy drinks would be overweight. He’s burning off the calories because he’s very active.

‘In some people drinking that much sugar, there will be concerns about diabetes and insulin resistance, too.'

Drinking such large volumes of Coca-Cola would also have meant he was consuming high levels of caffeine - and stopping this suddenly could cause a a dip in mood and performance.

One litre of Coca-Cola contains 106mg of caffeine, the equivalent to a mug of instant coffee. 

Experts recommend drinking no more than 400mg of caffeine a day.

Ms Cashin said: ‘Coke has caffeine in it which is performance enhancing. It’s a stimulant, it makes you more alert.  

‘However if you have caffeine withdrawal, that can affect you mood, concentration and athletic performance.’

Caffeine was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned substances until 2004.

Mr Lawrie says after quitting drinking two litres of Coca-Cola a day he lost confidence in himself.  He said: 'I wouldn't say I went through a breakdown but I definitely got exceptionally emotional. It was very difficult to deal with all of the situations coming at me'

Ms Cashin added: ‘Ten years ago we were advising people not to drink it, as 350mg a day pushed you over the limit.'

Another problem with consuming large volumes of fizzy drinks is they cause tooth decay, she said.

‘We are beginning to see athletes with tooth problems due to fizzy drinks and sports drinks.

'The diet versions also erode the enamel. I’m always conscious of talking to athletes about their teeth.’ 

The evidence on whether sugar or caffeine is addictive or not is unclear, she said, however some athletes develop a psychological dependence.

She said: ‘It could be a psychological habit or addiction. Lots of athletes do very strange things and feel upset if they don’t do them. So it could be something like that.

‘I wouldn’t like to link Mr Lawrie’s performance with his Coke “addiction” because in my view it sends out a message to younger athletes who we’re trying to tell not to drink these drinks.’
