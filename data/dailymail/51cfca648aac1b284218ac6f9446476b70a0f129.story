They were was built in 1928 by Western Union and AT&T to bring the telephone to Manhattan.

Today, the skyscrapers, among New York's first, are still at the cutting edge of communication.

It has been hailed as one of the world's best connected buildings, and is home to one of the biggest internet 'switch' points in the world, helping bring the internet to the US.

The building at 60 Hudson is home to one of the biggest internet 'switch' points in the world, helping bring the internet to the US.

When the Western Union and AT&T Long Lines buildings were built in the early 1930s, New York was already the largest city in the United States.

As the largest city in the nation and the financial capital of the US, New York also had the most telephones of any city in the entire world.

With that excess of telephones came a need for communication hubs to filter traffic—exactly what these two buildings came to provide.

Between 1928 and 1932, Western Union and AT&T built two of the most advanced telecommunications buildings in the world at 60 Hudson Street and 32 Avenue of the Americas in Lower Manhattan.

'Nearly a century later, the Western Union building and AT&T Long Lines building remain among the world's finest Art Deco towers—and cornerstones of global communication,' said Blake Mitchell of Telx, the firm which operates the data center housed in the building.

'They remain the central switchboards of our telecom culture; home to 400 carriers serving 600+ data networks—among the most richly connected buildings in the world,' he said.

Each building has incredibly strong foundations and rich connections throughout the city.

It has been upgraded with biometric security, and is now home to glass rooms housing many of the world'' most popular websites.

Western Union needed to communicate with AT&T’s network, which it used for its long-distance telegraphs.

Between 1928 and 1932, Western Union and AT&T Long Lines built two of the most advanced telecommunications buildings in the world, at 60 Hudson Street and 32 Avenue of the Americas in Lower Manhattan.

The building were originally built to bring telephone service to Manhattan

'We here at Telx are proud of the rich history of these landmark buildings and that we are also part of their legacy as we continue to use them for their original intention: working day to day as communication hubs for customers all over the world,' Telx said.

'As the film notes, the Western Union and AT&T Long Lines buildings are not monuments to a vanished age; they’re contributing directly to the recycling life of the city.'

The buildings even included dormitories for the hundreds of workers needed to connect Manhattans's calls

Now the room's are dominated by the huge bundles of cables needed to carry internet traffic

That rich connection and infrastructure is exactly why Telx chose to expand in New York City last year with its NYC3 data center, housed within the AT&T Long Lines building on 32 Avenue of the Americas.

The building is the third data center the firm has opened in the city - along with NYC1 at 60 Hudson Street (formerly known as the Western Union building), and NYC2 at 111 8th Ave.
