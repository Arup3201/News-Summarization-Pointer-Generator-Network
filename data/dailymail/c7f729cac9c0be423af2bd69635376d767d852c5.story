Robin van Persie has given Manchester United a much needed boost by returning to training and posting pictures of himself on Twitter, with the message 'Looking forward to Sunday!'

Manchester United travel to Sunderland on Sunday and are looking for their first points of the season after losing 2-1 at home to Swansea on the opening day of the campaign.

Van Persie tweeted two pictures of himself - one with the caption 'Good training session done this morning. Looking forward to sunday!', and the second accompanied by just the word 'focus'.
