Nigel Farage has accused Ukip's political rivals of spreading 'malicious' lies that he is 'seriously ill' - and insisted he would go on-and-on leading the party.

Speaking at Ukip's spring conference in Margate this afternoon, Mr Farage told activists that rumours of his demise 'have been greatly exaggerated' - but invited criticism after failing to unveil any new party policies ahead of the election.

He claimed political insiders from the main Westminster parties had started rumours that he had been keeping a low profile because he was suffering a serious illness.

But Mr Farage  said the reason he had not been in the spotlight was because he was campaigning in South Thanet, the seat he hopes to win at the general election.

He told delegates: 'There has been some considerable speculation as to my whereabouts. 

'My absence from the Westminster scene has even led our opponents to spread some really quite malicious and unpleasant speculation about my health.

'It's said I am seriously ill and that's why I've not been seen.'

Opinion polls had suggested the Ukip leader was trailing the Conservative candidate in the Kent constituency he hopes to win in May.

But, to cheers in the hall, Mr Farage hailed a new poll showing he is on course to win comfortably. 

'We're on our way to winning this seat,' he predicted.

Mr Farage also made clear he has no intention of calling it quits any time soon. 'We are going to win lots of seats in this general election and I hope very much to be leading this party not just into this general election, but in all the elections to come.'

Britain's sewerage system is struggling to cope with the influx of migrants, a senior Ukip figure has claimed.

Immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe raised the issue as he listed elements of infrastructure that were under pressure during his speech to the party's pre-election conference.

Mr Woolfe insisted the public did not care about 'colour of skin or race or creed'.

'What they are concerned about is that our eye has been taken off the ball for nearly a generation,' he told the audience in Margate.

'Schools are now full, hospitals are troubled, healthcare - it is very difficult to be seen in many areas of this country.

'Roads need to be built, we need to look at the way we feed ourselves because of our growing population.

'What about our water and sewage systems? All of these matter.'

Mr Farage's address came after the Ukip conference threatened to be overshadowed by a Nazi-themed troupe of dancers which turned up in Margate this morning, dressed in hot pants, jackboots and Nazi insignia goose-stepping to 'Springtime For Hitler'.

The dancers, from Mel Brooks's musical The Producers, caused the scene outside Ukip's conference venue - the Winter Gardens in Margate, Kent.

A seven-strong troupe of female dancers performed a choreographed routine as Springtime For Hitler blared from a PA system on the tank turret.

The cast were in Margate to promote the new touring production of the musical comedy about a failed producer who tried to put on the worst show ever.

The new UK production will features stand-up comics Jason Manford, Phill Jupitus and Ross Noble – as well as TV celebrity Louie Spence. 

Mr Farage was given a major boost today after research was published indicating he is on track to win the nearby seat of South Thanet.

The Survation survey, funded by party donor Alan Bown, put Mr Farage on 39 per cent ahead of Labour rival Will Scobie on 28 per cent when people were prompted with candidate names.

A previous poll by Tory Lord Ashcroft in November had suggested the Conservatives could retain the seat - where their MP Laura Sandys is stepping down.

At the party's conference today, Ukip MP Mark Reckless today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the 'party of the NHS'.

Mr Reckless, who won a by-election in Rochester and Strood after defecting from the Tories, said voters knew Ukip wanted to leave the EU and cut immigration.

But the party must 'talk about other things as well' and reassure people it is not a threat to the NHS in order to have wider appeal.

A leaflet produced by 'Christian Soldiers in Ukip' was being handed out to members today - accusing the gay community of a 'recruitment drive' in primary schools.

'The state is allowing the sexual grooming of our primary school children for same-sex attraction,' the leaflet said.

Children were being 'indoctrinated' to 'confuse their gender identity' and 'think about and sing songs about same-sex attraction'. 

Mr Reckless told activists: 'There are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the European Union, and we want to cut immigration.

'We should talk about those things. But if we want to get beyond 20 per cent-30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies, we will have to explain why we want those things, challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party, and talk about other things as well.'

Speaking in the US last night Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre.

Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.'

'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.'

He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 

'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.'

He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.'

'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 

'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.'

Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen

'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.

'The thing about us 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.'

While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.'
