In a ceremony at the White House in September, President Obama told family and friends Sgt Dakota Meyer's tale of courage and heroism.

The president described how Sgt Meyer charged through insurgent gunfire on five trips in a Humvee to save 13 Marines and Army soldiers and another 23 Afghan troops pinned down by withering enemy fire.

He personally killed at least eight insurgents despite taking a shrapnel wound to one arm as he manned the gun turret of the Humvee and provided cover for the soldiers, according to the military.

Exaggerated? Military documents reportedly claim that the deeds of Sgt Dakota Meyer described by President Obama and the Marines are inflated and in some cases, not true

But a journalist embedded with the soldiers who survived the firefight, as well as sworn statements from the military and Sgt Meyer himself, suggest those stories may be inflated accounts.

A McClatchy reporter said that the 
chronicle of the deeds that Sgt Meyer is said to have performed are full
of errors and in some cases, didn’t even happen.

For one, the claim that Sgt Meyer shot eight Taliban insurgents dead cannot be substantiated by the driver of the vehicle he was driving in, who testified that he only saw Sgt Meyer shoot one.

McClatchy also found that there’s no evidence to support that Sgt Meyer saved 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers, as the Marine Corps claims.

Why? Because 12 Americans, including the embedded journalist, were ambushed - and four of them were killed in the battle.

The
reporter’s first-hand account of the firefight also showed that the 
soldiers who did survive were saved - not by Sgt Meyer - but by U.S. choppers that flew in to 
help.

In addition, military medal historian
Doug Sterner told McClatchy that it’s unlikely that the Marines would 
release the story of a battle based on Sgt Meyer's account.

Stretching the truth: A military historian argues that many Medal of Honor recipients like Sgt Dakota Meyer have been commended on exaggerations of their deeds

Sterner said: 'Give me a break. A recipient is responsible for writing his narrative? I have never heard of such a thing.'

Sterner
added that the Meyer case is not alone, as many other Medal of Honor 
recipients have been commended on exaggerations of their deeds.

He said: 'Did this man deserve the Medal
of Honor? If the answer to that is yes, then the details of the 
citation become secondary. But we do need to keep the record as 
accurately as we possibly can.'

But despite the claims, there is no 
evidence to support that Sgt Meyer was falsely nominated for the honour, as seven witnesses reportedly support the fact that he risked his life repeatedly during the mission.

In Afghanistan, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley on the day of the ambush.

On Thursday, President Obama defended the Medal of Honor recipient, despite the McClatchy report about the account of his bravery.

Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday the award was based on sworn testimony, reviewed by the Marine Corps, and Obama 'remains very proud' of Meyer and his 'remarkable acts of bravery.'

The Marine Corps told McClatchy it was also standing by its citation
produced in Sgt Meyer's Medal of Honor nomination process.

Sgt Meyer declined to comment.

The revelations are the latest in a string of controversy for the Marine.

Last
month, he sued a defense contractor that he said ridiculed his Medal of
Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking 
problem, thereby costing him a job.

In a defamation lawsuit filed in Texas, Sgt Meyer alleges that his former employer, BAE Systems OASYS Inc. ruined his chances at landing a new job by telling a prospective employer that he was a poor worker during a three-month stint this past spring.

Leaving active duty in May of 2010, 
Sgt Meyer was hired by BAE in March the following year after working for
another defense contractor named Ausgar Technologies that hired 
veterans to train active-duty service members, according to the Wall 
Street Journal.

BAE's 
manager had claimed Sgt Meyer in that time 'was mentally unstable, that 
Sgt. Meyer was not performing BAE tasks assigned and that he had
a problem related to drinking in a social setting,' according to the 
lawsuit.

The lawsuit, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, seeks unspecified damages.

BAE Systems spokesman Brian 
Roehrkasse said the company was 
grateful to Meyer for his bravery but strongly disagreed with his 
claims.

Following his return from overseas, Sgt Meyer
had initially expressed interest in becoming a New York City firefighter after inspiration from his grandfather who was a firefighter in 
Kentucky as well as by the men and women who responded to the September 
11th attacks.

He missed the three-month 
application window to apply because of the whirlwind of events surrounding his 
Medal of Honor presentation, however.

A
federal judge in Brooklyn had agreed to extend the FDNY 
application period for 24 hours - giving Sgt Meyer until the end of the day to sign up, but Sgt Meyer turned down the opportunity, expressing his disapproval of his exception.

Born in Columbia, Kentucky, in 1988, Sgt Meyer enlisted in the Marines after graduating high school.

He began his service in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2007 as a sniper and was later sent to Afghanistan.

The White House said Meyer is the third 
living recipient of the military decoration since the Vietnam war.

He is the first Marine so honoured with the medal.
