When Kim Kardashian bared her derriere on the cover of Paper magazine in an attempt to 'break the internet', the reality TV star created a frenzy.

It is just one of many recent magazine images that show the 34-year-old flaunting her giant backside, each one more compromising than the last.  

But while many have been horrified by Kim's bare bum in the media, it turns out that it is nothing new - as Stylelite points out, bottom-flashing  has been a fail-safe marketing tool for nearly 60 years, selling anything from beauty products and magazines to albums and fashion. 

From The Coppertone Girl in 1959, left, to Kim Kardashian's infamous Paper magazine shoot last year, right, the bottom has a long history been used as a marketing tool

Long before the curvy Kardashians appeared on the scene, there was the Coppertone Girl.

In 1959, the suntan lotion advert featured a three-year-old girl on the beach trying to pull her pants out of her dog's grip, with the taglines,  'Don't be a Paleface!' and 'Tan - Don't Burn.'

The little girl in the illustrations was based on drawings of Cheri Brand by her mother Joyce Ballantyne Brand, was also famous for sketching the Pampers baby in 1977.

But little did Joyce know then, how dominant bottoms would become in advertising, as well as popular culture.

But it wasn't until a decade later, in the 1970s, that rear-ends began to be used prolifically in advertising. 

In 1971, The Motor Show At Earls Court, west London, combined two of men's favourite things: cars and women, by using two bottom-baring models, Susan Shaw And Helen Jones, to promote new vehicles on display.

Even serious financial institutions were at it - in 1978, TSB bank used a bikini-clad lady analysing her bottom in a mirror to promote their travellers cheque service.

Perhaps the best known behind from the decade though, was on the famous Athena poster.   

When Fiona Walker, a freelance illustrator, was snapped flashing her cheeks on the tennis courts at the University of Birmingham by her boyfriend, the then-unknown 29-year-old commercial photographer Martin Elliot in 1976, she could never have imagined how popular the image would become.

It has now sold more than two million copies internationally and been recreated by superstars such as Kylie Minogue and Ricky Gervais.

The couple split in 1979, three years after the photo was taken and while Fiona was never officially paid for the shot, Martin always said: 'I looked after her.'

The next significant moment in the derriere's part in pop culture came in 1984, with the picture of Bruce Springsteen's pert denim-clad behind on the cover of Born In The USA.

Shot by top photographer Annie Leibovitz, critics said the singer, nicknamed 'The Boss', only became a music icon after working out and showing off his new gym-toned rear on the album cover.

In 1992, rapper Sir Mix A Lot released his tribute to big bottoms, the Baby Got Back album. 

The cover featured the artist standing on a giant bottom and the song, with its shameless lyrics, was so controversial that it was banned from MTV.

The following year, in 1993, Benetton, well known for their powerful advertising campaigns, used a close-up of a bottom with a tattoo that read 'HIV positive' to raise awareness of AIDS.

In 1994, the BBC comedy The Fast Show started with a character created by Arabella Weir who always asked, 'Does my bum look big in this?'

The focus wasn't just on women's behinds though - in 1995, the pop star Robbie Williams posed up in a pair of white skimpy briefs, complete with back wig and high heels for 7-Up ad campaign.  

But the small tush tide was about to turn. 

By 2000, pop stars were using their bottoms to promote their music - and bigger was fast becoming better.

Jennifer Lopez took curves into the mainstream when she had a global hit with Jenny from the Block.

The singer was enormously proud of her large backside and instead of dressing to make it seem smaller, she actively sought out clothes that enlarged her bottom.

But it was the rapper Nicki Minaj who really got tongues wagging after she revealed her ample curves in a tiny pink thong. 

Her  explicit Anaconda video firmly proved that we are in the era of the rear end.

Styled as an Amazonian goddess, Nicki kicks off the Da Internz and Polow Da Don-produced video by standing on a bamboo platform surrounded by four bikini-clad back-up dancers.

The tropical-themed tune was guaranteed to get pulses racing with its cut-away shots of jiggling bottoms, including one of the dancers twerking while doing the splits.

Spoof versions of the cover quickly followed.

Sydney boy Shane Jenek, who goes by the onstage persona of Courtney Act, uploaded a spoof version with her head superimposed on an exaggerated version of Minaj's body and booty.

The controversy courting the artist roused a variety of reactions from the industry, with fellow pop star Katy Perry commenting: 'I wanna take a nap on dat pillow doe @NICKIMINAJ'.

But others labelled it 'overly explicit,' causing The Beauty And A Beat hitmaker to respond that the pose  was no more 'unacceptable' than similar images of white models.

To prove her point, the BET Award winner posted several images of Sports Illustrated models, including Kate Upton, striking poses that were equally racy. 

In fact, the men's magazine has long used scantily-clad women on its covers.

It included models Nina Agdal, Lily Aldridge and Chrissy Teigen wearing skimpy bottom-baring bikinis in the Cook Islands on the magazine's 50th anniversary cover last year.

Not long afterwards, Jennifer Lopez attempted to steal back the limelight for her bottom by releasing a song called Booty with rapper Iggy Azalea.

The cover for the track featured the two females baring their famous bottoms for the camera.

The song, which is a remix of Lopez's original, had an equally raunchy music video filmed to go with it.

The duo could be seen gyrating in revealing swimming costumes and being soaked with water.

It isn't only singers and models using their bottoms for promotion though. 

In 2011, it was announced that Britain's female beach volleyball champions were renting out their rears in an advertising deal that encourages spectators to photograph their behinds.

Zara Dampney, 24, and Shauna Mullin, 26, inked a deal where they would wear bikini briefs with a Quick Response (QR) code printed on the back where it will catch the eye of spectators.

When photographed on a smartphone, the code takes the user to a specific website - in this case, for bookmakers Betfair.
