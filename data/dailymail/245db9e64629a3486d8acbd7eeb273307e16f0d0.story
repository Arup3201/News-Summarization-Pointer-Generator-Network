Top judges have expressed concern that criminal illegal immigrants could be blocking mental hospital beds because laws stop them being being deported or released into the community.

The Appeal Court urged a 'speedy' review of the rules on mental patients who are not entitled to be in the UK after hearing from a top forensic psychiatrist that scarce beds that could be used by other patients are being needlessly occupied.

Dr Mark Swinton told the court in London it has 'proved very difficult' to discharge patients like Imtiaz Ahmed following successful treatment, as they are not legally entitled to post-release support in the community.

The doctor made his comments as three of the country's most senior judges reconsidered the sentence handed to the killer who throttled his landlady, 21-year-old Jeanette Hullah, as her baby son sat nearby.

In light of the problems he described, Dr Swinton urged the Appeal Court to make an order which would see Ahmed returned to prison - from where he could be deported - once his mental illness has been effectively treated.

But, saying they could not allow flaws in the system to influence their decision, the judges ordered Ahmed's release to be decided on by medical professionals.

Lord Justice Elias said: 'If Dr Swinton is right about this - and we have no reason to suppose he is not - it is indeed a most unhappy state of affairs and the authorities must look at it speedily.

'But we cannot allow it to play a part in deciding the proper disposal in this case.'

The court heard Ahmed, now 25, was lodging with Ms Hullah and her partner at their home in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, when he killed her in front of her 15-month-old son in December 2006.

However, he was so ill that he was found unfit to enter a plea and it was not until July 2011 that he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

He was handed imprisonment for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - and ordered to serve at least five years and three months behind bars, although that minimum term was later cut to three years and three months on appeal.

The court heard medical experts were of the view he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the killing and therefore his responsibility was significantly diminished.

By the time he was finally jailed in 2011, he had already served 15 months in custody on remand and three-and-a-half years in a secure hospital.

The Appeal Court overturned Ahmed's indefinite jail term and replaced it with a hospital order so that his release date will be fixed by clinicians, subject to the Home Secretary's final decision, rather than the Parole Board.

Lord Justice Elias said he accepted Dr Swinton's comments regarding the difficulties around his discharge, which could see him remain in a hospital bed and may be 'damaging to the appellant and to the wider public'.

However, the judge refused to make an order which would see him returned to prison following his treatment.

Sitting with Mr Justice Field and Judge Paul Batty QC, he added: 'We think that, in light of the circumstances, we do not feel it appropriate to impose a prison sentence as a form of punishment.

'Even less would it be appropriate to impose imprisonment for public protection, when it seems to us that, given the incident was caused by his mental disorder, there is no justification for detaining him once the medical authorities determine he can be released.

'This is a decision which, in our view, should be left to the medical authorities, rather than the Parole Board.'
