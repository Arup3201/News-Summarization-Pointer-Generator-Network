Renowned English painter John Constable got his right-hand man to ‘copy and paste’ outlines for his masterpieces, research suggests.

A picture by the famous landscape painter of figures and horse-drawn wagons on Hampstead Heath matches the composition for the right-hand foreground of two seminal works of Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead, painted in 1824.

At the time, Constable was at the height of his fame, winning the gold medal at the Paris Salon for The Haywain and View on the Stour near Dedham that year.

Auctioneers Bonhams say the painting was worked up from a pencil drawing by Dunthorne

He was receiving a rising number of commissions from Parisian dealers and English patrons, and was asked to create two almost identical paintings of Branch Hill Pond.

Under increasing pressure, Constable used his assistant Johnny Dunthorne to trace the figures’ outlines onto the larger canvas.

Auctioneers Bonhams, who made the discovery, say the painting was worked up from a pencil drawing made on-site - intended to be the foreground focus of Branch Hill Pond.

The outline of the closer horse, cart and figures are incised - implying they were probably traced by Dunthorne - while the paint was still wet and then transposed into the right-hand corners of the canvases he had prepared.

With the outlines in place, Constable would be able to work up the main body of the painting, building up the detail until he was satisfied with the finished masterpiece.

John Constable was an English Romantic painter from Suffolk. He is knowbn his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, now known as 'Constable Country'

The painting, which is 25cm wide, is replicated exactly in the bottom right-hand third of the two 75cm wide canvases of Branch Hill Pond.

It will go under the hammer at Bonham’s Old Masters sale on December 5, and is expected to fetch between £60,000 to £80,000.

The New Bond Street auctioneers say the painting, most likely created in 1824, has surfaced for sale after 62 years in private hands.

Dave Dallas, International Director of Old Master paintings, said: 'Constable is an extraordinary painter who continues to provoke debate among specialists across the world.

'Scholars are still unravelling his working methods and the extent to which Dunthorne was used in the studio.

'The incised marks on the study confirm what was long suspected, that Dunthorne traced key elements by Constable for use in major works. This new insight is an exciting discovery.

'The study reputedly comes from the artist’s studio and was then passed down to one of his granddaughters. Added to this is the fact that it hasn’t been seen on the market for so long, making this a truly unusual find.'
