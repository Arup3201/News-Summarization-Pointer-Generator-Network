It was a cruel move by a Czech website which left a 'shy' Miss Great Britain winner 'gutted' when they blurred out her face for being 'ugly'. 

But now Shelby Tribble, 21, from Plymouth, has proved her doubters at Extra.cz wrong by starring in a stunning new series of photos.

In the shoot, Shelby shows off her good looks and slim figure in a series of poses looking every bit the beauty queen.

Miss Great Britain Shelby Tribble looked stunning in a new shoot, in December she was criticised by a Czech website which said she was not attractive enough to be in a beauty contest 

It was in December that the Czech Republic's top celebrity website claimed British women are not beautiful using Shelby, the winner of Miss Great Britain beauty pageant, as a prime example.

The website claimed that she was not good-looking enough to told the title of a beauty queen.

In fact, they felt so strongly about Shelby's appearance that they went as far as to pixelate out her face on their site. 

Extra.cz said at the time that traffic for their articles about the Miss Great Britain beauty contest had gone through the roof after they declared the winner was not good looking.

In one of the first reports they included the headline: 'Great Britain has new Miss and she proves the rule that British women are not beautiful.'

It included the pixelated photo of Shelby, who has previously won a number of beauty queen titles in the UK.

As well as being crowned Miss Great Britain 2014/15, she has also been crowned Miss South West, Miss Hippodrome 2014, Miss Loaded 2014 and has been a Miss England finalist.

But the Czech article concluded that if she was to take part in a Czech beauty pageant, she would not even make the finals.

Publishing photos of the other Miss Britain contestants, it said that they contestants were: 'Ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde beats approximately 40 competitors. If you want to know why look no further than this gallery.'

And it pointed out that there was no surprise that famous British women like Emma Watson, Kate Middleton, Kate Moss, Cara Delevigne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet had decided to steer clear of the UK event.

Shelby was voted Miss Great Britain in both 2014 and 2015 and has won many other awards such as Miss Hipodrome 2014 and Miss Loaded 2014

Shelby looked back to her confident self as she posed for the new photographs

It said: 'It seems that the really beautiful British women that the UK produces prefer to invest the time in a career, leaving the beauty contests to the rest.'

In the Czech Republic, they said, beauty contests were at whole new level because they actually had women that were worth looking at.

They said: 'It's not really a surprise, hear in the Czech Republic it is an interesting event. The show is broadcasted live on national TV and the winner becomes a famous celebrity.

'But look at the British event, no celebrity guests, no four-hour-long show and most importantly, no beautiful girls.'

The story, which was a viral hit for the website, was then developed with further stories including one that said: '10 finalists for the English Miss contest that will make your eyes water. Such monsters are hard to find!'

In this relaxed look Shelby wore a pink shirt with white jeans with a pair of aviator style sunglasses 

The author then admits that they deliberately chose the ugliest but points out that they were nevertheless staggered that they ever made it even to the final.

It said they had no dress sense, cheap shoes and relied on revealing intimate body parts rather than real natural beauty in order to win votes. 

It was a hard hit for Shelby, who is no stranger to facing cruel taunts.

She describes herself as 'painfully shy' after being bullied at school and had to overcome low self-esteem in order to triumph as a beauty queen.

She said competing in beauty pageants and modelling has helped her turn the tables on her tormentors and gain a sense of self worth. 

And now these new photos show she is back to her confident best.
