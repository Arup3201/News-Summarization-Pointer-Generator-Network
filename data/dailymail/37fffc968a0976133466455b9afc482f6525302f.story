A video has emerged of police standing and ignoring pro-life activists as a protester tear down their posters and walks off.

The footage shows officers in Jackson, Mississippi, doing nothing as the man walks off with the  graphic signs depicting the aftermath of abortion.

Despite complaints from the group, the officers allow the man to steal the display from right in front of them.

Doing nothing: The footage shows a man picking up a pro-life demonstrator's sign in Jackson, Mississippi, as an officer watches 

Hiding away: The man then take the signs down to a basement below a store

'We got a guy taking our signs and walking with them right now,' an individual can be seen telling officers in the video, posted by The Blaze.

While another says: 'He’s just taking our signs and putting them in his basement'.

At another point, one man asks: 'Are you gonna allow someone to just walk away with our property?'

The officer admits that he is watching, but lets the man carry on.

Jackson Police Department have not commented on the issue but, according to pro-life organzation Created Equal, the man in the video has been charged.

Earlier this year, Mississippi Governor Phil Byrant said his goal was to 'end abortion'.   

The state has lower abortion rates than the rest of the country and only has one  clinic, the Jackson Women's Health Organization.

Footage: A cameraman continues to the protester as he takes the sign from the street 

Alerted: One of the demonstrators goes over to an officer to tell him the signs are being taken away 

Escorts in fluorescent yellow vests walk patients from the parking lot to the clinic, often as music blares from a boom box to drown out the protesters' voices. This means 99 per cent of Mississippi women do not have access to the service.

A law currently being debated in the state that would give doctors admitting privileges to local hospitals is threatening abortion laws and could close the lone clinic.

Members of a different three-judge 5th Circuit panel noted that the changes could force women seeking abortions to travel to other states. 

On February 27, 2006, the state’s House Public Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion. But the died after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise legislation

In 2011, voters rejected an anti-abortion initiative that would have defined life as starting at conception. It would have also outlawed abortion and many forms of birth control.

Not interfering: One of them asks the officer why they are doing nothing as they walk away with the signs
