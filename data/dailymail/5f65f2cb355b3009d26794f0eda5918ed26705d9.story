Dr Pam Spurr can help you identify your insecurities and overcome them with the quiz below

Dr Pam Spurr, self-help expert and author of The Emotional Eater's Diet advises on body-envy.

Where once women worried about bad hair days increasingly I see women fret about bad body days. 

Nothing is right about them, let alone a little un-tameable hair.

Body image research I did previously revealed over 2/3s of women worry about lumps and bumps, size and shape, and so on.

And this situation is worsening with many confessing they're forever comparing their bodies to other women's. 

Hardly surprising when we have a tidal wave of perfect-looking, airbrushed celebrities, models, pop stars, etc., arriving daily on our smartphones, tablets, PCs and televisions.

Body-envy is a game you never win as your self-esteem is chipped away. 

Plus the research I did for my latest book The Emotional Eater's Diet found that unfortunately body-envy sent many running for comfort food, making them feel even worse.

Take my quiz to find out if body-envy is damaging you. 

You might be surprised how many body-envy areas affect you day-to-day.

ANSWER YES OR NO TO EACH QUESTION BELOW

1/ When watching a woman give a presentation do you miss what's being said because you're scrutinising her figure?

YES NO

2/ Do you feel resentful when a friend/colleague's figure looks good in something or they wear a smaller dress size than you?

YES NO

Dr Pam says that by constantly comparing ourselves to others we can develop many more self-esteem issues ourselves 

3/ When watching TV with your partner do you switch channels if a woman with a good figure appears?

YES NO

4/ Do you feel worse about yourself after looking at, e.g., celebrity magazines?

YES NO

YES NO

6/ Do you feel there's nothing good/attractive about your body?

YES NO

7/ Are you the first to mention to a friend/colleague when someone else has put on weight?

YES NO

Feeling worse about yourself after looking in magazines is an indicator of Venus envy

8/ Do you feel you don't fit in with women with good figures, maybe even sometimes avoid them?

YES NO

9/ Do you frequently fantasise about having a completely different body?

YES NO

10/ Do you frequently end up talking about hating your figure and/or about other women's figures?

YES NO

11/ Have you ever taken an instant dislike to a woman because of her attractive figure?

YES NO

12/ Will you look for reasons to criticise, undermine or gossip about someone because they have a good figure?

YES NO

If you answered mainly yes then you could be suffering from extreme body confidence issues

1 – 3 YES answers: COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT 

Who hasn't occasionally compared themselves to and/or envied another woman? The occasional envious look, comment or thought is absolutely natural. 

Body-envy probably isn't a real concern for your self-esteem but look at your yes answers and how you might tackle them with the advice below.

4 – 7 YES answers: OCCASIONALLY INSECURE

You spend precious time and energy focusing on other women's figures. 

This can become a cycle that feeds itself - you envy a colleague's, friend's, or celebrity's figure and then look at yourself thinking I can never live up to them, and so on. 

Put the advice below to work before you seriously damage your self-esteem.

8 – 12 YES answers: OBSESSIVELY ENVIOUS

Not only do so many yes answers suggest body-envy is damaging your self-esteem and body image but it'll also damage your relationships with other women. 

This great big cloud of envy blocks out appreciating their personalities and inner qualities - as you should appreciate your own.

Beginning with yourself become actively aware each time you think about your body. It's worth keeping a record [even in simple counting-form] for a few days about how often you do. It may be an eye-opener.

Use a motto to challenge these negative body-thoughts, e.g., 'I'm so much more than my body.'

Dr Pam's book can help combat low self-esteem issues

Identify your hot-spots – things that start the self-criticising chain reaction. Do you hate your body when you've had too big a meal, when shopping for clothes, when around a friend/colleague who has a good figure? Know your 'enemy' and prepare for these.

Prepare by talking yourself up. For instance, tell yourself your friend (with the good figure) would hate knowing you feel bad about yourself when in her company. Talking yourself up with common sense calms down troubled feelings of envy.

Focus outward on the good things in your life that matter more than lumps or bumps. And focus inward on you who are so much more than your waist size. Yes, easily said but it's in your power to focus your mind instead of letting it control you with thoughts of body-envy.

Feeling fit combats body-envy. Feel invigorated with regular walks, swims, the gym, salsa classes, etc. Plus, mind your posture – stand tall, pull in your core muscles and see how good it feels. Everyone, no matter size and shape, feels better when fit.

Now you see other women's figures as a threat. Overcome this irrational thinking by questioning it. How are they a threat? How does a woman having a good figure affect your life? The honest answers are they don't affect your life.

Mind your language – when talking about other women stop yourself discussing their figures. Be aware of conversations slipping into shallow territory about someone's looks.

Stop revelling in someone putting on weight and being aware when you react negatively to someone just because you think they're better looking.

You don't have to 'emotionalise' everything so, e.g., take a so-what attitude if an attractive woman is on TV/movie when your partner's around. Rationalise it - he's not going to run off with an actress, is he?

This may seem impossible when eaten up with body-envy, but learn not to care when a colleague has a great figure – and even be happy for a friend who does. Remind yourself it is no reflection on you.

Finally, if you can't break the body-envy trap consider confidence and self-esteem coaching or counselling. Life is short, you are unique, and you need to break free of this damaging thinking and behaviour.
