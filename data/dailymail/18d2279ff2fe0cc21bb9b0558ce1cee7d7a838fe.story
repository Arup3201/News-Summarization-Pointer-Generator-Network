A sheriff's deputy allegedly sprayed a teenager's pizza with pepper spray after he was pulled over for a traffic offence.

Juan Tavera, 30, was arrested after the driver and four of his friends became sick when they ate the pizza.

It is thought the deputy covertly sprayed the pizza with pepper spray after noticing it on the back seat of the car that had been stopped by another officer for a traffic violation.

He had come to help the other officer who had pulled the 19-year-old driver over in Laguna Hills, Orange County, California.

Tavera, who is currently on paid administrative leave, had worked for the Orange County Sheriff's department for six years, the LA Times reported.

He was charged with one misdemeanor count of assault and battery by a public officer, and will be arraigned in Newport Beach today.

If found guilty he could face up to a year in jail.

Defence: Pepper spray is normally used by police to quell riots or subdue violent criminals (file picture)

Earlier this year a high school student was charged with five counts of misdemeanor battery after he spiked a school canteen meal with a spice concoction as intense as self-defence pepper spray.

Three canteen workers had to be taken to
hospital, and other students and staff at the public school in Chicago 
reported rashes and trouble breathing after inhaling fumes from a batch of marinara sauce.

The teenager had used Da Bomb hot sauce for his prank in June, which is so hot that the 
company sells it in a locked box.

Before purchasing it online, consumers
must read a waiver that reiterates the strength of the sauce, said to 
be more than 100 times hotter than a jalapeno pepper.
