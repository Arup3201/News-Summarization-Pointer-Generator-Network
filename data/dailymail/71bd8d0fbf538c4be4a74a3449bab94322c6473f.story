Athletes and spectators from Britain will be the target of ‘Russia’s Osama Bin Laden’ at next month’s Winter Olympics, a secret intelligence report warns.

The document, drawn up by Canadian counterterrorism agencies and shared with British intelligence, says Doku Umarov poses the greatest terror threat for the Games at Sochi in southern Russia.

Umarov, 49, is the Chechen jihadist leader blamed for the two suicide bombings in Volgograd in Russia over Christmas.

The warlord leads Imarat Kavkaz (IK) – an armed group fighting to impose Islamic rule in Russia’s North Caucasus, the mountainous region that borders Sochi.

The heavily-redacted report, compiled by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and seen by The Mail on Sunday, says Umarov has called for attacks on what he calls the ‘satanic games’.

The report warns: ‘Doku Khamaiovich Umarov is a fervent Islamist who espouses AQ’s [Al Qaeda’s] ideology of global jihad.

‘His view that Israeli, US and UK interests  are legitimate targets raises concerns that  any Westerners could  be targeted.’ 

It adds: ‘Umarov appears to have consolidated his leadership but questions remain over the extent cells will follow his lead – especially as some IK commanders eliminated by Russian counter terrorism efforts are being replaced by younger, less experienced fighters.’

British intelligence, led by MI6, is now working closely with Russian intelligence organisations to counter the threat.

Britain broke off security  co-operation with Russia in the wake of the murder of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. But  in November this year, MI6 confirmed they were now working with the FSB, Russia’s security service, ahead of the Sochi games. 

A Whitehall source said that security surrounding British citizens attending Sochi was of ‘paramount concern’ and confirmed Britain and Russia were working closely on the issue.

Last Tuesday Sebastian Coe, the British Olympic Association chairman, revealed the BOA was monitoring ‘closely’ events in Russia after 31 people were killed in the two explosions in Volgograd.
