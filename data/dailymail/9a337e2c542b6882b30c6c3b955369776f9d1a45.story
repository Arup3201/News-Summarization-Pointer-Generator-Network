More than 400 years after her untimely death, Anne Boleyn remains a source of interest and intrigue.

The success of TV show The Tudors and Hilary Mantel's Booker prize winning Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies proves that we still have an appetite for the rise and fall of the six wives of King Henry VIII.

And the life of his second wife, Anne, is the most scintillating story of all.

But while the fictional accounts play
up her role as a seductress and an adulteress who was even accused of 
relations with her own brother - what is the truth about the downfall of
the Queen?

Misrepresented? In the TV show The Tudors Jonathan Rhys Meyers as King Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn play up her image as a seductress

Intrigue: Historian Alison Weir, left, will delve into the mystery of the fall of Anne Boleyn at the Chalke Valley History Festival

Bestselling 
historian and author Alison Weir has researched how and why Anne came to
be sent to the Tower of London on 2 May 1536, tried on 15 May and 
beheaded four days later (along with her brother and other men of court 
she was accused of sleeping with).

Was
she guilty of the crimes she was accused of or was she framed by her 
husband - using the wiles of Thomas Cromwell to gain evidence against 
her - so he could marry his new object of affection Jane Seymour?

Weir will give her take on the downfall of the Queen, who she calls 'one of the most notorious women in Christendom', at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival on Sunday, 30 June.

Her talk, The Lady In the Tower: The Fall of Anne Boleyn, will draw on the research she used to write the biography of the same name that delves into the mystery surrounding the Queen's arrest and execution.

The talk is one of many events taking place between Monday 24 and Sunday 30 June at the UK's biggest history festival in Wiltshire.

Bringing history to life: The festival will include battle reenactments

Different eras will be showcased: Last year, this Napoleonic infantry group were a highlight

Action: As well as talks, the festival will include dramatic reenactments like this World War One trench charge

As well as talks from esteemed writers and historians, there will also be an encampment of living history through the ages that will bring periods such as the Roman era to life.

Live battles will be staged and an air show will be held featuring World War Two planes including the Spitfire and Hurricane.

London Mayor Boris Johnson will also be making an appearance on Saturday, 29 June.

He will give the talk Johnson's Life of London, where he will reveal the people who have shaped the buildings and culture of the capital city.

Notable appearances: Mayor of London Boris Johnson, left, and playwright Tom Stoppard will speak at the festival

On the same day, he will also join in a debate on whether ancient history matters more than modern history answering Monty Python's eternal question, what have the Romans done for us?

Another notable speaker at the festival is playwright Tom Stoppard who wrote the screenplay for the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love. He will discuss the idea of dramatic licence in theatre and film on Sunday, 30 June.
