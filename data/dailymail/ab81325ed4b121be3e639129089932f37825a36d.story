Authorities have seized Apple iPads from retailers in a city in northern China due to a dispute with a domestic company that says it owns the iPad name.

The Chinese company said it is asking for similar action in more than 20 other cities.

The dispute with Shenzhen Proview Technology threatens to complicate Apple's efforts to sell its popular tablet computer in China, its fastest-growing market.

Investigators started seizing iPads on Thursday in Shijiazhuang, southwest of Beijing, after receiving letters from Shenzhen Proview, said an official of the economic investigation unit of the city's Xinhua district.

He would give only his surname, Wang.

‘All the Apple iPads in the big 
shopping malls and supermarkets have been taken off shelves in Xinhua 
district,’ said Wang. He wouldn't say how many devices had been seized 
or the number of retailers affected.

An Apple Inc. spokeswoman in Beijing, Carolyn Wu, declined to comment.

Shenzhen Proview registered the iPad 
name in China in 2001. Apple bought rights to the name from a Taiwan 
affiliate, Proview Taipei, that registered it in various countries as 
early as 2000. The mainland company says it still owns the name in 
China.

Apple sold 15.43 million iPads in the quarter up until December, doubling from a year earlier

A Chinese court rejected Apple's 
complaint in December that Shenzhen Proview was violating its rights to 
the iPad name.

The court ruled Proview is not bound by a 2009 agreement 
under which Proview Taipei transferred the trademarks to Apple for 
£35,000 pounds ($54,700).

Apple has appealed against the ruling.

Last week it was reported that Proview Electronics also wants $1.6billion in compensation and an apology.

Last month Apple reported it sold 15.43 million iPads in the quarter up until December, doubling from a year earlier.

It did not reveal how many iPads were sold in China, but its worldwide profits hit a record £8.2billion.
