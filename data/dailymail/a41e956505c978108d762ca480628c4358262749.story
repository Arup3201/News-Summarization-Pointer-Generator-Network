A serial dieter has finally gone from fat to fit after beating the bulge to become a competitive bodybuilder.

Cindy Garcia-Lister, from Evesham, Worcs, transformed her body to become a super-toned body builder after ditching the fad diets.

Cindy, 31, now competes regularly and is hoping to win her first major title next year.

Cindy once tipped the scales at 13st (left) but has managed to drop down to a very toned 8st after taking up weightlifting. She is hoping to win her first major bodybuilding title next year 

She said: 'I can't believe how much my life has changed.

'I went from trying every diet under the sun, to going to spin classes and weight training almost every day.

'I feel so much healthier, and I absolutely love competing - when I look back at old pictures of myself, I find it hard to believe that it's me.

'I've also recently started my own personal training business to help people make a change like I did.'

Cindy, who once tipped the scales at almost 13st, now weighs a 8st and has dropped from a size 16 to a size six.

The toned brunette was slim as a child growing up in her native Costa Rica, but began to gain weight at university.

She said: 'When I went to university, I stopped doing any kind of activity or exercise.

'I'd moved away from my family and I was just very down and lonely.

'I was stressed due to the work load, so when I did eat it wasn't anything healthy - it was chocolate and crisps - all the wrong kinds of food.

'I was very afraid of the scales but I knew I didn't want to be in such bad shape, so I started dieting.'

Despite trying numerous fad diets Cindy was unable to shift her excess weight (left) before she began working out regularly and eating a balanced diet (right) 

Unfortunately, Cindy tried all the wrong diets and was unable to shift the weight.

She said: 'I'd just go on the internet and see what magic diets people were talking about.

'I tried so many crazy things - cutting out certain foods completely rather than actually eating a balanced diet.

'It wasn't until I saw a picture of myself when I went home to see my family that I just thought, "Oh my god, I need to do something".

'That's when I realised that I needed to start exercising and getting my fitness up.'

Cindy joined a gym, began weight training, and immediately noticed a difference.

Cindy says she initially tried many different types of training in the gym before settling on weight training 

She said: 'At first I tried lots of different methods of training, but it was the weight training that I loved the most.

'A lot of women are quite scared of weights but I thought they were great - and the fat just melted away.

'Every three months I was having to buy clothes in a smaller size.

'Soon, after chatting to people at the gym, I became interested in body composition and ways to make myself stronger.

'It's then that I learnt about body building.

'I was really sceptical about it at first - I'm quite a timid person and the idea of standing up in front of everyone in my bikini was pretty scary, but I knew it would be great motivation to get in even better shape. 

'When I told people what I was doing, they were a bit unsure about it too.

'Everyone warned me not to get too muscular, but I think I have the balance right.' 

Cindy, who has now started her own personal training business, says women are wrong to be scared of weight-lifting and credits her training with transforming her body and her confidence 

Cindy entered the bikini category for her first competition and fell in love with body building.

She said: 'When I walked out onto the stage for the very first time it was really scary - I had so many butterflies.

'But I was over the moon when I came fourth - I had no idea I would do so well.

'A few months later, I entered another competition and I managed to win three trophies, it was such a buzz.

'Now I'm starting to prepare for a huge competition next year held by the UK Body Building and Fitness Federation - it will be my biggest competition so far, and if I win, it will be my first major title.

'I've also recently started my own personal training business, something I would never have imagined I'd do.

'Some times I can't believe how much my life has changed, but I'm so glad I did it.

'It has been a real rollercoaster, but you learn a lot about yourself- it has been amazing.'
