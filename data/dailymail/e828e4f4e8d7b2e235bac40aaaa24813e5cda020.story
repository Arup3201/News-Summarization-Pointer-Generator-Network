Precariously parked speed trap vans are putting drivers' lives in danger, driving safety campaigners have warned.

An action group believes that rather than making roads safer, the police road safety vans are increasing the risk to motorists on British roads.

The Dorset Speed group has compiled a database of the mobile speed cameras parked in seemingly dangerous locations including roadside verges, hard shoulders and slip lanes.

Drivers' lives are being put at risk by precariously-parked speed camera vans like this one, according to road safety group, Dorset Speed

Campaigners from the group say that most motorists instinctively brake when they see a speed trap

It has been calling for a ban on speed cameras since the death in 2011 of motorcyclist Timothy Rowsell, 64, who crashed his bike and died after braking too hard when he saw a camera van near Bournemouth.

In the latest incident, a police vehicle was spotted parked on a concrete verge in front of a safety barrier along the Dorset Way dual carriageway in Poole, Dorset.

Ian Belchamber, from Dorset Speed, said: 'This is something that is not uncommon on our roads - police mobile speed camera vans are often spotted parked in dangerous locations.

'Not only does it put the camera operator's life at risk, but any car that crashed on that road would also be prevented from hitting the purpose built safety barrier.'

He added: 'We have seen camera cars in slip lanes, half mounted on verges, in cycle lanes, and sometimes just parked on the side of the road.

'The negative effects of speed cameras far outweigh the positive effects, and the result is that the police are making roads more dangerous, not safer.'

He said everybody's immediate reaction on seeing a speed camera was to slam on the brakes, regardless of the speed they were travelling, and added: 'If something isn't done to stop it then there will be more tragic cases like that of Timothy Rowsell.'

A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'Safety camera vans perform their duty at authorised locations.'
