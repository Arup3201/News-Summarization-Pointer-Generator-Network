Celebrity Big Brother contestant and British heavyweight boxer Audley Harrison hopes to take on David Haye in a £1million rematch when he gets out of the house.

Harrison who entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on Monday has called out Haye to go toe-to-toe with him in the boxing ring once again.

Haye defeated Harrison at the M.E.N Arena in November 2010 when the Celebrity Big Brother contestant was knocked out in the third round by his British rival.

'It's not something you do for a publicity, this is real s***.

'David Haye rematch - £1m take it or leave it.'
