The woman who accused Jameis Winston of rape described receiving death threats over the case, but said she pushed forward in hopes women would not trust the FSU quarterback.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that transcripts from a hearing over whether Winston violated the university code of conduct filled in details about the alleged assault in December 2012 and resulting fallout of the case.

'I was forced to leave FSU and my friends here,' the accuser said in front of retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding, who was asked to preside over the hearing by the university.

Hearing: FSU quarterback Jameis Winston leaves a student conduct code hearing in early December, while transcripts revealed he defined consent with the accuser as 'moaning'

'I was subjected to a number of death threats, and my parents' home and work addresses were posted online.'

'I have had my most horrible life experience played out and debated in local and national media that couldn't care a less about me.'

Winston also spoke in front of Judge Harding, at first declining and then later agreeing to answer a question posed by the former justice, according to ESPN.

'I would like to know in what manner, verbally or physically, that [the accuser] gave consent,' the former justice asked.

'Both, Your Honor, verbally and physically,' Winston answered.

'And what did she say and what did she do?' Harding questioned.

'Moaning is mostly physically. Well, moaning is physically. And verbally at that time, Your Honor,' Winston responded, before adding that this happened during the sexual encounter.

The accuser detailed why she was pursuing the university hearing in the face of harassment and threats, stating that accountability would be 'worth it.'

Demands: Winston's attorney David Cornwell previously submitted a letter to FSU officials claiming that an attorney for the accuser had tried to extort Winston for $7million

'Respondent will no doubt go on to be an even bigger celebrity in NFL. But before he leaves here he deserves to have some accountability for his violent behavior,' the accuser said in transcripts.

'Perhaps even being expelled will have minimal deterrent effect on him. But if expulsion discourages even one other woman from trusting him in the future it will have been worth it,' she added.

Winston's lawyer, David Cornwell, has accused the alleged victim of trying to extort the quarterback, claiming in a letter to FSU officials obtained by TMZ that the accuser's lawyer demanded $7million to settle sexual assault claims before the case had gone into the media.

The New York Times found that the criminal investigation was so poorly conducted that police waited almost a year from the time the alleged victim reported the assault to interview a witness who recorded the act.

By then, the digital video the witness, who was Winston's roommate and teammate, had recorded with his phone was gone, along with the phone itself.

The hearing concluded with Harding stating the two sides presented conflicting arguments, and that the evidence was 'insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof.' 

Baine Kerr, one of the accuser's lawyers, was unhappy with how the hearing progressed and said it was just to 'whitewash' previous reports.

'I don't want to impugn the proceeding as corrupt, but I think it was biased and the fix was in, It's all about a football game 10 days from today,' said Kerr.

'It turned out to be just a predetermined whitewash to keep a guy playing football.'
