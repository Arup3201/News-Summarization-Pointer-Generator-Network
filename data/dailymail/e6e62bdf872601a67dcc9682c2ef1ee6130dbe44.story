Elvis Presley's pair of personal jets could fetch up to $15million when they go under the hammer at auction on Friday.

The Lisa Marie and the Hound Dog II, designed by the late King of
Rock and Roll himself, will be offered together to
bidders at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, auction house said.

They are no longer airworthy, but have been on view for
visitors at Graceland - Presley's Memphis, Tennessee estate -
for the past 30 years.

The singer bought the Convair 880 jet from Delta Air Lines in
1975, two years before his death at age 42, for $250,000. He
named it 'Lisa Marie' after his daughter.

Mile high memorabilia: Elvis Presley's pair of personal jets are going under the hammer on Friday at Julien's Auctions in Beverley Hills and could fetch up to $15million. The singer bought the Lisa Marie (pictured), a Convair 880 jet from Delta Airlines, in 1975 

Luxury: The King of Rock and Roll also bought the Hound Dog II Lockheed Jetstar in 1975 as the Lisa Marie was being refurbished 

Presley spent more than $300,000 refurbishing the jet with a
penthouse bedroom, executive conference room, bar and videotape
system linked to four TVs. He had the plane painted red, white
and blue with his motto 'TCB' - 'Takin' Care of Business' - on
the tail.

The four-engine 28-passenger Convair could fly Presley, who preferred to travel at night, up to 3,000 miles (4,800km). There would typically be three crew members on each flight. 

The last journey the plane took was when it transported Priscilla Presley and Elvis’s good friend George Hamilton from California to his funeral. 

He purchased the eight-to-10 passenger 'Hound Dog II,' a
Lockheed Jetstar, also in 1975 for about $900,000 while waiting
on the refurbishment of the 'Lisa Marie.'  

The buyer also has the option to purchase several acres
adjacent to Graceland to display the jets, independent of the
Presley museum.

An agreement between Graceland and the jets' current owners,
whose identity was not disclosed,  is set to expire at the end
of April.

Comfort: Presley spent more than $300,000 refurbishing the Lisa Marie, installing a penthouse bedroom. He preferred to travel at night as he toured and the jet could take him 3,000 miles 

Attraction: The two planes have been on display at Elvis' Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee for the past 30 years. Visitors can walk around the Lisa Marie (pictured) and walk through the number of seating areas in the cabin

Jet-set lifestyle: The singer bought both of the jets in 1975 and spent thousands refurbishing them. The new owner also has the option of buying land near the Graceland estate to display the jets

Business: As he toured, the musician could sit down with his management at the conference table and enjoy a drink from the bar 

Interior: Presley spent around $900,000 installing the Lisa Marie in 1975, two years before his death. The plane's capacity was 28 and there would normally be three crew members on board 

One of the luxury installments Elvis asked for when designing the interior was a gilded wash basin in the bathroom 

Inside the Hound Dog II, the leather seats that can carry between eight and ten passengers are decked out in yellow, green and blue

Both of the planes, which will remain at Graceland until April, are no longer airworthy and can only be used for display 

Journey: One of the last flights made by the Lisa Marie was when Elvis' wife Priscilla (left) was flown to his funeral in California
