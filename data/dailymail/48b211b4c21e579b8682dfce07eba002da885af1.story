Falcao Fever has struck London with 13,000 tickets sold in the first four days of ticket sales for the friendly between the United States and Colombia at Craven Cottage.

Jurgen Klinsmann's team take on the Colombians on November 14 and the initial surge of demand was so great that the Fulham website crashed.

It will be the first time the USA have staged a home game at the Cottage, where there are so many connections to a club dubbed FulhAmerica across the Atlantic Ocean because of former stalwarts like Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey and Fulham's American owner Shad Khan.

There has been huge demand for the friendly between Colombia and the US at Craven Cottage thanks to the presence of Manchester United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao

Real Madrid midfielder and World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez is also likely to feature

There is a strong 20,000 Colombian community in the capital, too, and it could be close to capacity with the lure of seeing Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez adding appeal for the neutral fans.

Falcao has played only five times since moving the England in August has missed the draw against Chelsea on Sunday with injury. United fans will be both keen to see more of him and relieved Colombia are coming to England to play after their previous friendly fixtures were in North America.

Fulham's American contingent are also excited about the game, which is two days after a game against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on November 12.

'It's the perfect fit,' said McBride, who is on Khan's five-man panel to identify the club's next manager, and former Fulham and US captain Carlos Bocanegra added: 'I'm thrilled that the US team will play at a stadium that has meant so much to the American players who got their chance at Fulham.

'The fans there were incredibly supportive of us, and we have so many great memories there. Craven Cottage has one of the most intimate atmospheres I've ever played in. Sitting in the Cottage is like having a rooftop seat at Wrigley Field – it's an experience every fan should have in their lifetime.'

Fulham fans will be interested to see if Klinsmann names Emerson Hyndman in his squad after the 18-year-old from the club's academy made his senior US debut against the Czech Republic in September.

Owner Khan will be in London next month when his NFL team the Jacksonville Jaguars play at Wembley against the Dallas Cowboys on November 9. 

USA's coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for Tottenham, will return to London but this time as a manager
