A bold plan to breath new life into Houston's ailing space industry has been unveiled with a futuristic spaceport designed to cope with increased demand from thrill-seeking tourists.

The city announced yesterday that it had applied for a licence to build the United States' latest and biggest spaceport, and has already drawn up a detailed proposal of what the state-of-the-art facility would look if it gets the green light.

The spaceport, which would be built on a 450-acre site that is currently home to the US military and NASA operations at Ellington Airport, would include a sleek passenger terminal and an aviation museum.

Lift off: Houston has applied to build the latest spaceport in a bid to enter the commercial space race

Mario Diaz, director of Houston's Department of Aviation, said the spaceport would provide tourism from a terminal similar to airports, where 
people would board and take off much as they would an aeroplane.

But, according to the Chron,
when the aircraft arrived over the Gulf of Mexico, it would head straight up and give passengers a tour of outer space, before returning to earth and landing at the spaceport.

The plan also includes providing accommodation for reusable launch vehicles, facilities to build space vehicles, training facilities for astronauts, and the ability to launch microsatellites.

Mr Diaz said: 'How does the city dubbed "Space City
USA" hold onto the title in the 21st century? We think this is the 
answer: the Houston spaceport.'

Mr Diaz added with Houston's history of involvement in the space industry, it was natural that the city would want to build the latest space port.

The city received a double body blow in 2011 when first the space shuttle fleet was retired, and then NASA decided to contract out future space station work to private companies.

Although Houston remains home to more than 50 aerospace contract companies, the city has suffered the fallout from job losses.

Futuristic: The spaceport would allow flights for space tourists, and would also provide facilities for commercial operations

The full cost of the spaceport has not yet been calculated, but Mr Diaz said the application process with the Federal Aviation Administration could take up to 15 months.

If it is granted the licence it would hope the spaceport would be operational within five to 10 years.

It could be paid for by a combination of funds from the private sector, city bonds and federal grants.

Houston mayor Annise Parker said: 
'This is a new and exciting sector of the 21st century economy that 
carries amazing potential for growth.

'We
believe a licensed spaceport in Houston would not only serve as an 
economic generator for the city but it would also enhance Houston's 
well-deserved reputation as a leader and key player in the aerospace 
industry.'

There are currently eight licensed spaceports in the US, including facilities in Alaska, California and New Mexico.

Eight other locations, including Houston, are in various stages of development. Other areas in Texas working on spaceport proposals include Brownsville and Midland.
