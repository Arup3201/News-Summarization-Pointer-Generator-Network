Busted: Germaine Gardea was charged with bigamy after his second wife found he had been married to another woman

Hell may hath no fury like a woman scorned, but what about two of them?

Germaine Gardea, 38, was arrested and charged with bigamy a week ago after his second wife discovered he had been married to another woman without her knowledge.

Gardea has reportedly lived with both wives in two separate Texas towns since 2009 - with neither of the women knowing of the other’s existence.

The second wife, Leslie Gardea, was also unaware that her husband was married because he showed her documentation that he and the first wife divorced on October 16, 2009 - the same day they were married.

Gardea had filed for divorce, but the case was dropped because he did not show up at a court hearing, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

He was reportedly found out after Leslie Gardea discovered that her husband had been writing checks to another woman.

Leslie Gardea then called the first wife, who helped her unravel Germaine Gardea’s alleged web of lies.

Fort Worth police spokesman Sgt Pedro Criado told the Star-Telegram: 'The first wife knew nothing of the second wife until she made contact with her.'

He added: '[Gardea] has a job in which he travels extensively so I suppose the extended time away from either wife was easily explained until the bills were located.'

It was the first wife who reported Gardea’s alleged misdeeds to the police.

Work: With his second wife Leslie, Gardea owns the Aviator Air Centers in Grand Prairie, Texas, a rental and pilot training facility

He was booked on October 11 on a charge of bigamy and later released from jail after posting $2,000 bond.

Germaine and Leslie Gardea own a flight training school together called Aviator Air Centers located near the Grand Prairie Municipal Airport.

The Star-Telegram reported that that the first wife claims that she did not know of any divorce document and contends that Mr Gardea may have forged her signature.

Germaine and Leslie Gardea did not return calls by the Star-Telegram for comment.

Robert Hoover, the divorce attorney for the first wife, told the paper that his client would not be speaking about the case.
