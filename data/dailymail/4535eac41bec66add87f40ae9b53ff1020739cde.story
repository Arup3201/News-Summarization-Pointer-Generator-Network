They sent Daniel Craig's career into the stratosphere and set a million women's hearts racing.

Now THOSE blue swimming trunks, which

to make hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity in an online auction that starts today.

Other lots include a one-third scale model of an Aston Martin

The car was used in earlier Bond films and has become closely associated with the fictional double agent.

'We
used it in the film but we had to make a model of it. We made an extra 
model, one third scale that was made for the film and I think that’s
a pretty unique thing to get.'

The model is expected to fetch £30,000 to £40,000, while another Aston Martin built in 2008 and used in 
the opening sequence of the last Bond movie Quantum of Solace has a

There’s plenty of things for a whole range of collectors.'
