She used to be known for eye-poppingly short hemlines that barely covered her 'vajazzle', but Amy Childs seems to have turned a corner when it comes to her fashion sense.

Former TOWIE star, now businesswomen, Amy Childs has launched a rather grown-up and very glamorous 'Floor-Length & Fabulous Collection' for the 2014 party season.

From elegant drop-shoulder evening dresses, to stunning sequined gowns and sophisticated jumpsuits, the collection is a far cry from what early critics of the 23-year-old's foray into fashion might have expected.

Amy Childs' new collection features elegant floor length designs such as this Trudie Red dress, £80.00

The new collection is a far cry from Amy's Essex days. Pictured is the Una dress, £99.00

Amy keeps the neckline demure in this Stefanie Blue dress (£90.00) but introduces sex appeal with a daring thigh split

Modelling the dresses herself with 
her long hair gently curled and swept  over one shoulder, and with her 
trademark perma-tan toned down to a healthy glow, Amy oozes high-octane glamour.

Speaking
 about the collection, Amy said:'Everyone has a little black dress in 
their wardrobe, but sometimes us girls want a more sophisticated look. 
I've designed my Floor-Length & Fabulous collection to be elegant 
and sexy; showing some leg yet skimming the floor.

'With
 a splash of glitz and glam detailed on every dress, the collection is 
perfect for formal dinner parties, masquerade balls and New Year 
celebrations. I've also chosen a variety of different styles, including a
 jumpsuit, so you can look fabulous in a floor-length frock this 
Christmas and New Year.'

Amy
 Childs' Floor-Length & Fabulous Collection is stocked online on 
www.amychildsofficial.co.uk and at her flagship store in Brentwood, Essex 
and boutique in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon, Essex as well 
as High Street stores Next, Lipsy and BANK.

The Mandy jumpsuit (£80.00) means that even those who don't like dresses can rock full length glamour

This stunning Pippa Red dress (£95.00) is embellished with eye catching crystals on the ruched waist

The Tamara Silver (£90.00) dress would certainly make you stand out at your New Year or Christmas party

The Stefanie Red, £90.00, left, and Trudie Black, £80.00, right, dresses both incorporate a thigh slash but allow you the option of sleeves, as well as a choice of neckline
