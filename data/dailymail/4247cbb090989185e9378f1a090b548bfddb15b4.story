German football star Marco Reus has been fined more than £427,000 pounds - for driving his luxury Aston Martin without a licence.

It is the highest motoring offence fine ever handed down in the country.

The 25-year-old Borussia Dortmund and Germany winger was stopped by police several times and received speeding tickets on at least five occasions since 2011 before authorities twigged he had been driving without a licence.

'I decided back then to take that road but the reasons I did it are something I cannot really understand today,' Reus told German daily paper BILD.

Dortmund's prosecutor's office said the fine related to incidents from 2011 until this March. 

It is not uncommon in Germany for wealthy people to be hit with mammoth financial penalties because authorities take the view they can afford to pay them.

'Today I know that I was too naive and that it was stupid. I have learned my lesson and this will not happen again,' Reus said. 

The club could not be immediately reached for a comment.

According to Bild he got stopped for the final time in March this year when he was en route to a training game in Dortmund and a police patrol pulled him over. A quick check on the computer showed he had no licence - and never had one. 

He was blitzed by speed cameras on the autobahn five times for going too fast and each time he paid the fines - but police then did not know he had never passed a test.

Henner Kruse of the Dortmund prosecutor's office said: 'Six times between September 2011 and March 2014 he was stopped and so the fine for driving without a licence is very high.' 

Reus is estimated to earn around £150,000-a-month. 

The midfielder, who missed Germany's World Cup triumph in July after picking up an injury in the final warmup game, is a transfer target of several major European clubs, including Liverpool.
