A British mother has started a global craze after her wacky campaign to let her young children dress her has been copied by parents across the world.

Pippa Best launched an experiment to let her kids choose her outfit for the day - often leaving her wearing a bizarre and colourful outfit.

Pippa, 42, did the school run dressed as a pink princess following fashion advice from her daughter Loveday, four, and said the whole thing just snowballed.

Pippa Best, 42, from Penzance, asked her daughter to pick her outfit one day and then tweeted the pic with the hashtag #mykidsdressedme 

Under the twitter hashtag #mykidsdressedme her campaign has now gone viral with parents in the UK, America and Canada among those taking part.

Mother-of-two Pippa of Penzance, Cornwall, said: 'I let my four year old daughter choose what I wore on the school run and it started from there.

'The response has been amazing and it is also a great way to bond with your children.'

People have already begun handing the clothing power to their children, posting pictures online of the results. 

And the craze has not just been reserved for mothers - fathers got in the act too but seemed to get off lighter with a smartly dressed shirt and trousers typical of the outfits chosen.

Pippa herself was transformed into a Princess with a pretty pink outfit accessorised with a teddy bear.

Pippa then allowed her son Jago to dress her. Pictured: Pippa with her daughter Loveday and son Jago 

Pippa said it raised a few eyebrows but even more smiles when she wore it in public.

She said: 'I posted evidence of my outfit on Facebook, encouraging others to have a go and it went crazy with comments from friends trying to psyche themselves up to have a go too.'

Pippa's son Jago, six, has also dressed her, making her wear a cork-tassled Australian hat for a visit to the Royal Mail sorting office in Penzance.

She said: 'It's a great confidence booster for children.

'They feel like visionary stylists, and I felt pretty amazing afterwards that I was actually brave enough to prance around looking like that.

'I am just relived that my children haven't found my dressing up box yet. That would be terrifying.'

Pippa is now cashing in on the success of the campaign to raise money for Comic Relief by asking for donations from those taking up the challenge.
