The United States has pulled
more staff out of its embassy in Yemen, U.S. officials said on
Thursday as Washington scrambled to cope with the collapse of a
government that had been a key ally in the fight against al
Qaeda.

The scaling down of its presence in Yemen is the first sign
that the latest turmoil there will affect U.S operations in a
country that President Barack Obama hailed just four months ago
as a model for 'successful' counter-terrorism partnerships.

The U.S. diplomatic contingent in Sanaa was drawn down due
to the deteriorating security situation in the Yemeni capital,
the officials said. They insisted there were no plans to close
the embassy, which could been seen as erosion of U.S. resolve in
counter-terrorism operations in the volatile Arab country.

However, current and former U.S. officials say the chaos
engulfing Yemen has already threatened the administration's
strategy against a powerful local al Qaeda branch.

Word of the withdrawal of more U.S. personnel came on the
day that Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi stepped down,
throwing the country deeper into chaos days after Iran-backed
Houthi rebels battled their way into his presidential palace.

The crisis marks another setback for U.S. Middle East policy
when Obama is already struggling with unsteady partners in a
campaign against Islamic State militants who have seized swathes
of Iraq and Syria. At the same time, Washington seeks to limit
Iranian influence in the region.

The Obama administration was caught off guard by the
resignation of Hadi, who had backed American strikes against al
Qaeda militants. During Obama's six years in office, U.S. drones
have killed hundreds of militants but also dozens of civilians
in Yemen, which has stoked public anger in the country.

'We are still assessing the implications,' White House
spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One.

The State Department had already reduced staff at the
embassy in recent months to essential personnel, mostly related
to security matters, as the fighters from the Shi'ite Houthi
minority seized control of the capital.

'While the Embassy remains open and is continuing to
operate, we may continue to re-align resources based on the
situation on the ground,' a senior State Department official
told Reuters. 'We will continue to operate as normal, albeit
with reduced staff.' 

U.S. officials had hoped that Hadi's announcement on
Wednesday that he was ready to make concessions to the Houthi
movement would calm the situation but that prospect fell apart
just a day later.

Washington is concerned that the chaos in Yemen could create
conditions that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) will
exploit to strengthen its base of support there and use the
country to plot attacks on Western interests. AQAP claimed
responsibility for deadly attacks in Paris early this month.

The events in Yemen will 'absolutely' limit U.S. drone
strikes and counter-terrorism operations in the country in the
short-term, a former senior U.S. official said. The official
added that if the Houthis end up in full control of the
government they will demand a halt to the drone campaign.

'They hate al Qaeda,' said the official, referring to the
Houthis. 'But they also hate the United States.'

Some U.S. officials believe that while the Houthis are
determined to wield more power in Yemen the movement may not
want to assume responsibility for actually governing the
divided, impoverished country.

But overall the Obama administration appears to have few
contacts with the Houthis and remains concerned that their
emergence as the country's main powerbrokers will mean greater
influence for Shi'ite Iran in Yemen's affairs, a prospect that
also worries neighboring Sunni power Saudi Arabia.

U.S. officials say Iran has backed the Houthi rebellion with
financial and political support and that shipments of Iranian
weapons have also been found destined for the group.

Senator John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and a frequent Obama critic, said events in Yemen
reflected misguided U.S. policy and called for a full evacuation
of the embassy there. Obama's earlier hailing of Yemen as a
counter-terrorism success, he added, showed the president 'is
either delusional or misinformed.'

The crisis poses another major challenge to Obama's efforts
to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

A U.S. official said Washington had no intention of
repatriating any of the nearly four dozen Yemeni detainees
already approved for transfer from the internationally condemned
jail while the security situation remains unstable in Yemen.

Obama lifted an moratorium on sending Yemenis home nearly
two years ago and has no plans to reinstate it, the official
said. But he has yet to send a single Yemeni home from
Guantanamo since ending the ban, instead transferring a handful
for resettlement in other countries.
