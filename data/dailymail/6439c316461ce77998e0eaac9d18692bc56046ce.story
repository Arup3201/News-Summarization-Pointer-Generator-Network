A teenager has claimed her high school banned her from carrying out an on-campus 'prom-posal' to her girlfriend because they are lesbians.

Casey Akers, 16, from Keller, Texas said she often sees students ask others to be their dates to prom while at school yet when she was going to ask a female friend, they told her it was 'not appropriate'.

Speaking to NBC, the teenager said she believes it is because both she and her friend are gay.

Denied: Casey Akers, pictured, said her school gave its permission for her to carry out a 'prom-posal' on campus - until they found out she was asking a girl. The school has denied the claim

'I gave them all the details before. They say it's fine. They find out who I am asking, then say it's not fine,' Casey told the channel.

Her mother, who helped Casey prepare for her promposal, said she does not know why the school is stopping her from asking someone they know is her friend.

After being told she could not 'prompose', Casey sent a private message to a friend on Twitter about what had happened and, with Casey's permission, the friend shared it publicly.

'I asked the administrators if I could do a promposal, not mentioning it was for a girl,' Casey wrote in the now-widely-circulated message.

'I had a box with flowers on it, cookies and a poster that said "Out of all these cookies, you're my favorite one. Prom?" The girls name is Cookie and that's where the idea came from.'

Plan: Her mom helped her decorate this box with paper flowers so she could jump out and surprise her date

But  as she walked to lunch, staff members approached her and told her it was 'not appropriate' to ask her friend, adding: 'You know why.'

Within hours of the friend sharing the message, the hashtag #LetCaseyPromposal started trending on Twitter and hundreds of youngsters began messaging the teenager to show their support.

'Regulating who your students ask to prom is disgusting #LetCaseyPromposal,' one wrote.

Casey said she still intends to go to the prom with her friend.

The school district released a statement saying they did not allow any student - regardless of their sexual orientation - to carry out promposals on campus.

'Any previous promposals that have occurred have done so without District approval,' their statement said.

'Promposals, and other similar public displays, may create a disruption to the academic setting, therefore they are not allowed for any student.'

Casey and her friends noted they had often seen promposals carried out on campus.
