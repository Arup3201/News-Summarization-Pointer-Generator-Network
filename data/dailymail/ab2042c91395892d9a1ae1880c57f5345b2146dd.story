Ilkay Gundogan has pricked up the ears of Manchester United after the Borussia Dortmund midfielder revealed he is open to a move to the Barclays Premier League.

Gundogan won the Bundesliga title with Dortmund in 2012 but has grown frustrated in Germany, having seen his career stall due to a back injury that restricted him to just three appearances last year. 

The 24-year-old, who has been heavily linked with United, almost signed for Real Madrid before Dortmund turned down an offer, but Gundogan admits a move to England or Spain remains inviting.

'Real Madrid made an offer for me but my club refused it,' the Germany international said.

'At the time I had two more seasons on my contract. But also, my injury wrecked everything. I couldn't play for 14 months.

'Now I want to look forward and make up for lost time with sporting success.

'Playing outside Germany is one of my big goals. If one day I leave here, I'd like to play in Spain or for one of the big teams in England.'
