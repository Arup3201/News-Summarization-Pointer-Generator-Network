Police have thwarted a school shooting plot by two teenagers, one of whom idolized mass shooters, just a week after a student opened fire in the halls of a suburban Denver high school.

The boys, aged 15 and 16, allegedly planned to carry out the attack at Colorado's Trinidad High School after winter break.

The school's resource officer was tipped off on Thursday, a day before the teens were arrested on suspicion of making a credible threat against a school and inciting destruction of life or property.

The boys have not been identified because of their ages.

Following the warning, extra security was in place at three Trinidad schools on Thursday, the last day of classes before the break.

Police Chief Charles Glorioso said investigators learned the 15-year-old had been bullied and had said he idolized the Columbine High School and Colorado theater shooters.

Glorioso, who said the boys planned the attack for about a month and a half, would not release the details of their plot or how they would carry it out.

He said a search of their homes did not turn up any weapons, but 'they had talked about what they could do to get them.'

It's unclear if the teens have hired attorneys.

Glorioso commended the resource officer for acting quickly on the tip.

'His thorough investigation uncovered the threats and put a halt to any plan made by these students,' he said.

Police have recommended the two be charged with inciting destruction of life or property, a felony, and interference with school, a misdemeanor, but it will be up to prosecutors whether to file charges.

Frank Ruybalid, district attorney for Las Animas and Huerfano counties, said that he couldn't discuss the specifics of the case because it involves juveniles but that he supported the response by police and the school district.

'Any evidence regarding a threat to students at our schools is going to be taken very seriously,' he said.

The shocking news comes less than a week after student Karl Pierson opened fire at 
Arapahoe High School, south of Denver, critically wounding Claire Davis, 17, before killing himself.
