Taken during the twilight hours, a British photographer has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the perfect shot including climbing rooftops, hanging from helicopters and even entering restricted military areas. 

And Paul Reiffer's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the  beauty of some of the world's most famous cities by night.

Each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails.

City snapper, Paul Reiffer, 34, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes, including this of Tower Bridge in London

Reiffer, 34, from Weymouth, Dorset, spent over three years amassing the collection of nightscapes and has visited some of the world's most iconic landmarks in the process.

Whether it is the bright lights of the New York City skyline, the winding bridges of Shanghai, or the wispy reflections of Singapore's harbour, each of Paul's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl. 

By using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image, the British photographer  is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail.

Constantly on the move, Paul is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio.

Paul said: 'Some of my images require a lot of planning, unfortunately, one of the ways I decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops.

'Some with full permissions and authorised access, others less so.

'Ironically, while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy, it's the more 'unofficial' shoots which take the most planning.

'Generally if you search online, or see a city in a magazine, the same old shots will appear time and time again, so while I use other images for reference, I tend to then start researching using tools like Google satellite view and 3D maps along with sunrise/sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city.

The roads may be devoid of traffic here in Kuala Lumpur, but it simply gives the light trails more prominence

'The shot of the Nanpu Bridge in Shanghai was the most difficult shot to take of the collection, while hanging from helicopters and lying in the middle of roads sounds challenging, photographically this was a real pain.

'Let's just say you need to trust the front half of your feet to get to the place, as that's the only part which will be touching the ledge of a building as you walk along it 30-odd storeys up in the air.

'I've had to run from some locations with a memory card in my underwear before now! Not because of anything illegal, more an argument with an overzealous security guard on a building I was photographing from.

'Because of the resolution of these images, they can be printed big and when you see a cityscape at two or three meters wide and are able to see every detail of every parked car, building window or landmark in the distance, it's quite impressive.'

The Shanghai interchanges are mesmerising, and only at night would you ever see them this quiet
