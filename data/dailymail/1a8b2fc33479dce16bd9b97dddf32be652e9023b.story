Bonuses in the City soared to record levels in April this year as bankers deferred pay outs to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax, new figures suggest.

Labour leader Ed Miliband challenged David Cameron over the dramatic rise in payouts to business and finance workers, up 64 per cent year-on-year.

The sharp rise came as the top rate of tax fell from 50p to 45p from the start of April.

Rise: Bonus pay rose dramatically in April this year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics

During an intense clash at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Miliband revealed the figures from the Office for National Statistics which showed that bonuses in the business and financial services this April were 64 per cent higher than a year ago.

The Labour leader said: ‘The reality is that bonuses are up 64 per cent in April in the City because he has cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.

‘So people took their bonuses in April and got a massive tax cut as a result.'

He added: ‘For all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform.

‘Lending is falling, bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires.’

Average weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were £143 in April, up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level in records dating back to 2000.

Mr Cameron took aim at Labour’s record in power, blaming them for a failure to regulate.

The
Prime Minister said: ‘Bankers bonuses were about a third of what they 
were when he was in the Treasury. They have been going down not up.’

He
said Mr Miliband, and shadow chancellor Ed Balls, had questions to 
answer about their role working for the Treasury before the financial 
crash.

Mr Cameron added: ‘In
2012-13 city bonuses will be 85 per cent lower than they were in 
2005-08 when those two were working or advising the government with 
responsibility for regulating the City.

‘He cannot get over the fact that they presided over the boom and bust and a failure to regulate.

‘They cannot hide their dreadful record and they should start with an apology.’

In January Goldman Sachs abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate.

The u-turn came hours after Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King branded the idea 'depressing' and accused bankers of mis-judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash.

The investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years, due to pay out in January until after April 6.

But the bank's Comp Committee of the board ruled out the idea.

Prime Minister David Cameron said Labour had failed to properly regulate the banks before the 2007 crash

BT chief executive Ian Livingston is to become a government minister.

He will replace former HSBC chairman Lord Green as trade minister when he stands down at the end of the year.

David Cameron told MPs: 'I can announce today that Ian Livingston, for the past five years chief executive of BT, one of Britain's most successful businesses, will take on this vital role.

'I believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort.'

The row came as a major report 
recommended that bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the 
right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for 'reckless misconduct'.

The
new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their
'shocking and widespread malpractice', the Parliamentary Commission on 
Banking Standards said.

Not a
single British banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash
began in 2007, but the proposed legislation would make sure they would 
be 'on the hook' in future, it added.

As well as prison terms, errant 
bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services 
industry, as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being 
cancelled.

In the Commons, Mr Cameron was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties.

'Yes, I do support both of those measures," he said.'Obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report.

'But penalising, including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly, I say yes. Also, making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers' money that you can claw back... bonuses, I say yes too.'

He said ministers would be using the Banking Bill currently going through parliament to implement the plans.
