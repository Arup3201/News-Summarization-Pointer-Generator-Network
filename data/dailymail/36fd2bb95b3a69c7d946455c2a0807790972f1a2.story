James Marcus Howe, 42, died the morning before Thanksgiving after an intruder posing as a solicitor shot him

Reality TV director James Marcus Howe, 42, and a female identified as his wife, were shot last week on the morning before Thanksgiving in what seemed to be a 'random act of violence'.

Howe died and his wife remains hospitalized. Police were called at 10:51 a.m. on Wednesday November 27.

Police continued to search for the 
shooter today. The unknown suspect barged into the home on the 4400 
block of West Avenue 42 in Los Angeles and opened fire, reported KTLA.

According to a release 
from the Los Angeles Police Department, Howe opened the door after 
hearing a knock.

As he approached the door, two intruders forced their 
way into his home. Police reported that there was a struggle, and during the scuffle, one of the two intruders fired a gun.

According to LAPD, the intruders were described as two black males, one between the ages of 16 and 22 and the other between the ages of 20 and 15.

The older suspect is thought to be the shooter. There was allegedly one black female involved in the shooting as well.

According to Police, the members of the trio were posing as solicitors.

Police are searching for an early 2000 Ford Mustang, dark in color, that witnesses saw speed off after the shooting.

LAPD Detective Harold Dicroce told CBS 2 that Howe and his wife recently moved to the neighborhood with their 6-year-old son.

Neither of the victims had criminal records.

The child was not home at the time of the shooting and is being cared for by his aunt.

Howe was a reality TV show director and worked on shows such as 'America's Next Top Model' and 'Tila Tequila'.
