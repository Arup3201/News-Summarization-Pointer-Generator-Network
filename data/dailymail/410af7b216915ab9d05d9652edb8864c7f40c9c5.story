There have been some incredible own goals down the years but Milan Gajic may well have topped the lot of them on the opening weekend of the Swiss Super League season.

Gajic and his team-mates looked in visable shock after the midfielder planted a sensational 25-yard volley into the top corner of the net, as a result giving opposition side St Gallen the lead.

The Serbian midfielder looked a little dazy and confused after the goal, but one thing that was for certain is that it was one of, if not the sweetest strike the 27-year-old has hit during his career.

Uh-oh: St Gallen players celebrate the bizarre goal which gave them a 2-1 lead in the game

Clinical: Gijac fires in an unstoppable drive...into the wrong goal

What made it all the more bizarre was that it appeared St Gallen had lost possession and Young Boys were in no danger of conceding, before Gajic quite literally had a moment of madness.

Luckily for Gajic his blushes were saved after a last-gasp equaliser from Young Boys ensured a share of the spoils.

However, this will be one moment the Serbian will never forget, and one world football won't either, with this surely already set to be the best own goal of the 2014-2015 season, unless something even more spectacular occurs.

Elsewhere, Real Sociedad defender Carlos Martinez also put the ball into his own net this weekend, and although not in as dramatic circumstances as Gajic's, it was still fairly bizarre considering the fact he tried to blame his goalkeeper for the goal afterwards!

And that despite clearly heading the ball too high over the on-rushing keeper! To compound misery the Spanish side ended up losing 3-1 to their Dutch opponents, Ajax, in the friendly game. Not the best day at the office for Martinez - that's for sure.
