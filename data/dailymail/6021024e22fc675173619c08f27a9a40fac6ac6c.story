Legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years - with one in ten people in Britain now admitting they have tried the drugs.

New types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, a report has found.

And the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the UK struggling to keep up.

The new study by the United Nations also shows that the UK is one of the worst-affected countries in Europe.

Figures show that 8.2 per cent of Britons questioned in 2011 had taken so-called designer drugs. Only Ireland (16.3 per cent), Poland (9 per cent) and Latvia (8.8 per cent) were worse.

And experts warn the problem is likely to have grown because of the rising range of chemical compounds sold.

The UN's Global Synthetic Drugs Assessment report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe, with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier.

Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make-up to get around existing bans.

Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law. Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited.

Users of so-called designer drugs were warned that they are playing 'Russian Roulette' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which compiled the report, warned the 'health threat' to those snorting, swallowing or smoking the narcotics - wrongly assumed to be safe because they are not outlawed - was 'growing rapidly'.

Doctors and nurses in Britain have been left 'powerless' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so cannot provide appropriate medical care.

A separate study in February found 97 people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009, meaning the toll has risen eight-fold in three years.

Natascha Eichinger, the UNODC's synthetic drugs researcher, said: 'The danger is people are consuming new psychoactive substances without knowing that they're doing so.

'So once these people have severe health issues and they wish to receive treatment they don't actually know what they've taken. It gives treatment centres huge difficulties.'

The report added: 'Emergency services may therefore find themselves unable to identify life-threatening substances and powerless to administer the proper treatment to users.'

The 76-page study warned that designer drugs are increasingly popular among young people and are no long restricted to 'niche' markets.

Angela Me, the organisation's head of analysis, said: 'Twenty years ago, you would have the heroin user, the cocaine user, but more and more people are using a variety of illegal and non-illegal drugs.'

Ministers have pledged to update drugs laws to stop unscrupulous chemists dodging bans. The UK is the only country to control mephedrone, a former designer drug known as 'meow meow' which was classified as a class B substance in 2010 after being linked to a spate of deaths.

The government has introduced a temporary banning system to try to keep pace with the influx of new drugs. It allows a 12-month ban on a substance while experts examine its harm and consider whether it should be outlawed permanently.

But Ms Me said governments - including Britain - were failing to keep up with the proliferation of legal highs and urged a widening of existing bans.

She said: 'There is evidence that when these substances are controlled there is an impact on the number of deaths.' The UNODC said data for the UK suggested controls may have led to a decline in mephedrone use.

A survey indicated that annual use of the drug had dropped from 51 per cent in 2010 to 19.5 per cent in 2011 after it became illegal. However, another study conducted at two dance clubs in London found 52 per cent of people had uses mephedrone in the year - second only after cocaine at 59 per cent - indicating it was still popular.

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'The coalition Government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in what are somewhat inaccurately called "legal highs", which has tragically claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country.

'Hundreds of substances previously sold are now controlled drugs in the UK, mainly thanks to our use of generic legislation.'
