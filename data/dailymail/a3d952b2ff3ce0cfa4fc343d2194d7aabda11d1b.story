Outspoken: Former Government Minister Gary Streeter said he was cured by prayer

A ban on Christians claiming ‘God can heal’ has been challenged by a Tory MP who says he was cured  by prayer.

Former Government Minister Gary Streeter spoke out after advertising watchdogs outlawed leaflets claiming God could cure people of back pain, depression and other ailments.

The Advertising Standards Authority condemned material handed out by the Healing on the Streets group in Bath as misleading after a complaint was made by an atheist.

The authority, chaired by former Labour Culture Secretary Lord Smith, also warned that the leaflets could deter sick people from seeking essential medical attention.

But Mr Streeter cited his own religious ‘healing’ experience to challenge the ASA ruling.

The MP, who was born with a painful condition in his right hand, claimed it had been cured after his wife Janet and other Christians prayed for him.

Mr Streeter, MP for Devon South West, said: ‘It troubled me all my life. As soon as I got kicked or hit in the wrong place playing sport, it would be very painful.’

But the MP told The Mail on Sunday that since attending a church meeting in 1983, he had been pain-free.

Demand: Mr Streeter also challenged Lord Smith to say if his authority would now rebuke football fans who have been praying for footballer Fabrice Muamba, pictured recovering from a heart attack in hospital

He said: ‘Towards the end of the service, we were asked if anyone was in need of healing. My hand had been causing a lot of pain for a long time. I just stood up, my wife put her hand on my back and prayed for me and job done.

‘Unfortunately, it stills look a bit funny but it hasn’t hurt since.’

Evidence: Mr Streeter has now called on Lord Smith to say 'on what scientific research or empirical evidence' the ASA based its decision

Mr Streeter, chairman of Christians in Parliament, said he suffered from a vascular problem, and added: ‘Basically, in my wrist, two arteries go into one where they shouldn’t.’

He has now called on Lord Smith to say ‘on what scientific research or empirical evidence’ the ASA based its decision.

He also challenged him to say whether his authority would now rebuke the tens of thousands of football fans who have been praying for Fabrice Muamba, the Premiership player who suffered a heart attack in the middle of a game.

Mr Streeter said: ‘It’s a pretty remarkable thing that the ASA can make such a statement, especially at the same time as we are all supposed to be praying for Fabrice Muamba.’

The MP, who served as a Minister in John Major’s Government in the Nineties, also launched a stinging attack on secular Britain as well as the commercialisation of Easter.

He said: ‘We are living in an age of unbelief. It’s important from time to time for people to actually express what mainstream Christianity is  all about. It’s not about bunnies and painted eggs – it’s about issues of life and death.’

Mr Streeter’s comments come after David Cameron issued a rallying call for Christians to fight back against attempts to ban the wearing of crosses and town hall prayers.

The Prime Minister used a pre-Easter meeting with Church leaders to say Britain needed the ‘values of the Bible’ more than ever.

The ASA last night confirmed the Healing on the Streets group had appealed against the ruling.
