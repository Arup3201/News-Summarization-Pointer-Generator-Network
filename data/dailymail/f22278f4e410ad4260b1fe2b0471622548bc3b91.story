Four men have been detained by police as part of an investigation into the 2011 takeover of Rangers.

The men, understood to be former Rangers administrators Duff and Phelps employees Paul Clark, David Whitehouse and David Grier and former Rangers director and solicitor Gary Withey, were detained on Friday morning by Scottish police working with officers from three English forces.

Police Scotland said the four are being held as part of a probe into the 'alleged fraudulent acquisition' of the Glasgow club.

According to reports in the Daily Record, a warrant will also be issued on Friday for the arrest of former Rangers owner Craig Whyte.

It is believed Whyte, who bought the club from Sir Dave Murray for just £1 in 2011, is wanted in connection with the allegedly fraudulent purchase of the club.  

The operation that saw the four me detained on Friday took place at a number of addresses in England and involved officers from the Thames Valley, Cheshire and Surrey forces.

It is thought the men have been detained because of claims that Grier and Whyte were known to one another before Duff and Phelps were appointed administrators for Rangers.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Following a Police Scotland operation on Friday November 14, four men have been detained as a result of the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers Football Club.

'At around 6am, officers from Police Scotland, assisted by officers from Thames Valley, Cheshire Police and Surrey Police, attended a number of addresses in England and detained four men.'

And Rangers boss Ally McCoist has spoken of his shock surrounding the incident.

'Obviously I can't or wouldn't comment on a current police matter, but I would have to say I'm shocked,' he said.

'Obviously I can't pre-judge what is going to happen.

'Our concern has always been for the staff and supporters. What's happened to us in the last two-and-a-half, three years has been very tough, particularly on the staff and supporters.

'We just want to continue with our attempts to get the club back to where we feel we belong.'
