The streets of an eastern Spanish town were awash with red pulp today, as thousands of people pelted each other with tomatoes during Tomatina, world's most famous food fight.

At the annual fiesta in Bunol, trucks dumped 125 tonnes of ripe tomatoes for some 22,000 participants - many from abroad - to hurl at the hour-long morning festivities.

Every year, the fiesta begins at around 10am with what's known as the palo jabon, in which brave revellers attempt to climb a greased pole to reach a ham, which has been placed at the top.

Then a loud signal begins the onslaught of tomato madness. Tonnes and tonnes of especially grown tomatoes are thrown into the town's main plaza, where they're crushed, so as not to cause injury.

The fight lasts an hour and covers the whole town square with red pulp. A large scale cleaning operation involving fire truck hoses ensues.

This is the second year non-resident participants were charged to take part. The town of about 20,000 people began charging to help pay off debts of some 5.5 million euros (£4.3m).

The event, which was sold out weeks ahead, was inspired by a food fight between local children in 1945 in the tomato-producing region.
