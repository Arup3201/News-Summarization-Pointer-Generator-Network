This is the moment a police officer was shot and wounded outside the kosher deli outside Paris where an Islamist militant held terrified hostages. 

The officer, dressed in black, is seen taking cover behind a silver Smart car and slumps over when he is hit outside the store in Porte de Vincennes, eastern Paris.

Hostage taker Amedy Coulibaly, who was killed in the raid, opened fire in the supermarket before telling police who flooded the area: 'You know who I am.'

Coulibaly was also responsible for the fatal shooting of a policewoman yesterday.

He had threatened to kill his captives if police launched an operation against the Kouachi brothers cornered on the industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele. 

The
assault began with gunfire and a loud explosion at the door,
after which hostages were rushed out. 

Armed with an assault rifle, Coulibaly had taken women and children captive and was threatening to kill them if police attempted to storm the Charlie Hebdo terrorists who, at the time, were engaged in a similar stand-off with police on the outskirts of Paris. 

Four hostages were dead as French special forces stormed the building and at least two police officers were hurt in the battle with the brothers. 

News footage of the supermarket showed dozens of
heavily armed police officers massed outside two entrances.  

Later, photographs showed a man holding an infant being put into an ambulance by police while others were carried out on stretchers.
