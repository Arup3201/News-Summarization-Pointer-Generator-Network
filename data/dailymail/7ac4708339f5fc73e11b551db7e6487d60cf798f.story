She may have a head for numbers but it appears her daughter prefers the planets and stars.

Carol Vorderman yesterday revealed Katie King has set her sights on becoming an astronaut.

And the 22-year-old, who studied physics at Cambridge University is keen to follow in the footsteps of Helen Sharman, a British chemist who became the first Briton in space and the first woman to visit the Mir space station in 1989.

Carol Vorderman yesterday revealed her daughter, Katie King, has set her sights on becoming an astronaut

Miss Sharman, now 51, was selected to travel into space on 25 November 1989 ahead of nearly 13,000 other applicants. The programme was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies.

Miss Vorderman, who rose to fame as the maths whizz on Channel 4 quiz Countdown, is keen for Miss Sharman to mentor her daughter.

The 53-year-old TV star, who has earned her own pilot licence so she can undertake a solo round the world flight, told how Katie's coming of age birthday gift was a trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to watch the final Atlantis mission.

'I went to see the Space Shuttle launch for my daughter's 18th birthday because she wants to be an astronaut, so I took her.

'She's learning to fly. She's been at Cambridge doing physics and in the University Air Squadron which is the RAF.

'I've met Helen a couple of times. I haven't yet but I should put my daughter in touch with her. She'd be the perfect mentor.

'Helen is lovely. She's very down to earth – no pun intended – she's a Sheffield girl.'
