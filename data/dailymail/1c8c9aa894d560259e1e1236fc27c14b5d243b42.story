Barcelona forward Neymar suffered a nasty blow to his ankle during his side's match against Atletico Madrid on Sunday night.

The Brazilian - who scored the Catalan giants' first goal of the night - went down clutching his right ankle after feeling the full force of a strong challenge from Atletico centre half Jose Gimenez.

Neymar looked to get to the ball first on the edge of the box in order to have a shot on goal, but the 19-year-old got there before him taking the ball but also the man.

The 22-year-old writhed around in agony on the floor with blood seeping through his sock, before being taken off the field for treatment.

That wasn't to spell the end of Neymar's evening though, with him returning to the field after just a couple of minutes. 

Neymar has been in sensational form for Luis Enrique's men so far this season, scoring 17 goals in 22 appearances.
