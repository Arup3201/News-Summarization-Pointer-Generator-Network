Seasoned traveller: This tiny red-necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round-trip from Shetland to Peru

He may not be much to look at but this little fellow is a record breaker.  

Despite weighing less than a bag of crisps, the red-necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round-trip from Shetland to Peru.  

The incredible journey is the longest recorded for a European breeding bird - and one of the world’s great migrations.  

Malcolm Smith of the RSPB said: ‘To think this bird, which is smaller than a starling, can undertake such an arduous journey and return safely to Shetland is truly extraordinary.’   

The red-necked phalarope is one of Britain’s rarest birds, with as few as 15 nesting sites in the Shetlands and the Western Isles.  

It has been thought that after breeding in Scotland, they set off eastwards to winter in the Arabian sea.  

But a tiny tracking device weighing less than a paperclip and worn like a backpack revealed they go somewhere else entirely.  

Mr Smith said: ‘When this guy left Shetland, he headed west straight across the north Atlantic, via Iceland and Greenland.  

‘He went down the eastern seaboard of North America into the Caribbean, crossed into the Pacific where he wintered in the warm waters of Ecuador and Peru before returning back by more or less the same route.  

‘That’s one of the world’s great migrations.’

Mr Smith told BBC Scotland that he almost fell out of his chair when a tag on discovering the details and added: ‘We are freezing up here in Shetland and it’ s quite nice to think of our red-necked phalaropes bobbing about in the warm tropical waters of the Pacific.  

‘It means that what we thought was a medium-distance migrant is a long-distance migrant. 

Incredible journey: The bird flew west from Shetland, across the north Atlantic and down the eastern seaboard of North America, before crossing the Pacific to reach Peru

Data: A tiny tracking device attached to the phalarope revealed how far the bird had travelled

Lightweight: The tracking device worn like a backpack on the bird is no bigger than a paperclip

‘It is one of the world’s great migrations.’

One of Britain’s rarest birds, the red-necked phalarope is a wader that arrives in Scotland in mid to late May and mates and raises its young before setting off again in July or August.  

In a reversal of gender roles, the more brightly coloured female often leaves the male sitting on the eggs while she touts for new mates. 

Despite their marathon migration the red-necked phalarope does not hold the world record.  

The Arctic term travels a colossal 43,000 miles in a round trip between the two poles makes it the ultimate long-distance traveller.
