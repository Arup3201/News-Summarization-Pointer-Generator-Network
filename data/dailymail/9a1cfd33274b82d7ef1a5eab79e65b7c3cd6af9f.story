Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes that Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is making a ‘mistake’ by signing for Barcelona.

The controversial Uruguayan is set for a summer move to the Catalan side, after Liverpool entered formal discussions with the Barcelona chiefs this week after Suarez received a four-month ban from world football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Scholes, however, has questioned whether Suarez will fit into the Barcelona side along with Argentine star Lionel Messi and the former England international even suggested that the striker would be better served signing for Real Madrid.

Writing in his Paddy Power
 blog, Scholes said: ‘If Luis Suarez does sign for Barcelona from 
Liverpool, will Lionel Messi ‘accept’ him? Suarez is a centre forward 
and he won’t want to play out wide. I can’t see Suarez and Messi linking
 well together.

‘It
 seems to me, if Messi likes you, you’ll play. If he doesn’t, you’re 
wasting your time. And, to be honest, I think Suarez is making a bit of a
 mistake going to Barcelona – he’d be better suited to Real Madrid.’

Meanwhile, former Liverpool striker 
Michael Owen has backed Liverpool’s decision to finally part with 
Suarez, suggesting that the Uruguayan’s repeat offences may render his 
career in English football as untenable. 

He blogged on Sportlobster.com: ‘If I were the Liverpool manager I would probably sell Suarez, but only if the deal was right for the club.

‘Given his misdemeanours in the last few seasons, it will be very difficult for him to continue to play in England.

‘If the deal was right for Liverpool, it would be best for all concerned if he moved on to a new club.

‘But it would have to be a club outside of the Premier League and at a price of £70million plus.’
