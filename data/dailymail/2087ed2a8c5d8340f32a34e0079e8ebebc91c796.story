Police are hunting for a gang of gunmen who opened fire on a pickup truck of immigrants, killing two passengers.

The vehicle, thought to be carrying at least 30 immigrants, was ambushed by camouflaged men carrying rifles, on Sunday night near Eloy, Arizona.

The passengers are thought to have been in the country illegally, according to  Dawn M. Barkman, a spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.

Police are still unclear as to why the 
the gunmen opened fire, but the shooting happened in an area commonly 
used by human smugglers.

The other passengers ran into the 
desert, five were found hiding nearby and after being interviewed, 
handed over to Border Patrol. 

The reaming migrants have not been found. 

Ms Barkman said 'every possibility is being investigated.'

In the past gangs have accosted groups 
of illegal immigrants that have just been smuggled across the border for
monetary gain - they can hold them for ransom or extort money from 
them.

Police and Border Patrol agents said they responded about 10:35 pm on Sunday evening.

No information about two migrants killed has been released.

It is not the first time that a gang in camouflage has attacked a vehicle passing through the area.

In
January 2007, four men wearing camouflage and berets and armed with an 
assault weapon killed a smuggling suspect and wounded another person 
after ambushing a vehicle in a field about 40miles north of Eloy.

Location: The shooting occurred south of West Antares Drive near the border of Pinal and Pima counties

Then
two months later, gunmen wearing dark clothing ambushed a vehicle 
loaded with more than 20 illegal immigrants near Green Valley, south of 
Tucson, killing two people.

Two men from Mexico were arrested following that shooting, Barkman said.

A third suspect still hasn’t been found, she said.

Border Patrol agents from Casa Grande responded to the shooting along with officers from Eloy and Coolidge.
