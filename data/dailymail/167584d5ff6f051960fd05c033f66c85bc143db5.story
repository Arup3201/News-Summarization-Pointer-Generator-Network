Former Leicester City, Birmingham and Blackburn Rovers midfielder Robbie Savage has avoided a driving ban for clocking up 99mph on the motorway after his lawyer claimed the pundit is unable to share public transport with football fans who hate him.

The 40-year-old, who was caught speeding as he drove home from Alan Shearer's charity ball, will be allowed to continue driving his £230,000 Bentley because it is considered 'a safe haven' for the controversial commentator. 

Savage could have been banned for up to 28 days but was instead given a meagre £600 fine, despite a possible £2,500 penalty.

Gary Rae, from the charity Brake, told MailOnline: 'It's an insult to those who have lost loved ones because of speeding drivers.

'Driving at such a dangerous speed hardly makes his luxury car a "safe haven" for other road users.'

The court heard how Savage was caught on the A1 near Knaresborough last month, while driving back in a custom-made Bentley to his home in Prestbury, Cheshire, with his wife Sarah, according to The Sun. 

The pair had been at Shearer's ball the night beforehand and Savage was driving quickly to get home to his two sons, the court heard. 

The former Wales captain, who was not in court, was said to be running 'slightly late' after slowing for average speed cameras.

Savage's lawyer Philip Morris said that the defendant needed to keep his car because he is in 'regularly accosted in public' due to the nature of his work as a BBC and BT Sport pundit, in which he has to give controversial opinions.

The barrister added: 'Someone once described him as being like Marmite. You either love him or the opposite.' 

He also told the court that Savage relied on family members to look after his children when he was busy because he is too famous to employ a babysitter, according to the Yorkshire Post.

The star was given six points for the offence, bringing his total up to nine points, following a previous offence of using his phone at the wheel.Savage must also pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge.

If he had been driving just 1mph faster, Mr Savage would have been forced to attend court in person and would have been extremely likely to face an automatic ban.

As well as working for the BBC, the 40-year-old (centre) is now a football pundit for BT sport

A spokesman for Savage refused to comment on the case.

The player had a reputation as a hard-tackling midfielder during his career with clubs including Leicester, Birmingham, Blackburn  and Derby County, and attracted fierce opposition from rival fans.

He was originally a trainee with Manchester United, but despite being released by the Premier League giant Savage went on to captain Wales, playing 39 times for his country.

In 2011, he appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, partnering Ola Jordan, and he now hosts his own football show on BT Sport.
