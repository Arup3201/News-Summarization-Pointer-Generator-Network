This group of 'foolish' walkers were caught on camera as they tried to conquer snow-covered Mount Snowdon with just shorts, trainers and lightweight jackets to protect them from the elements.

More serious walkers branded the ill-equipped group an 'accident waiting to happen', as they passed them struggling to reach the summit of one of Britain's highest peaks.

Members of the group were filmed by another more experienced climber as they made their way up the mountain, which at 3,560 ft above sea level is Wales's highest.

Exposed: A group of 'foolish' walkers  were caught on camera as they tried to cover snow-covered Mount Snowdon with just shorts, trainers and lightweight jackets to protect them from the elements

Off the leash: One walker was even filmed dragging a dog up the mountain using a scarf as a lead

Fashion fail: Another member of the group who wore shorts to tackle the mountain, despite the thick layer of snow

One walker was even dragging a dog up the mountain using a scarf as a lead, while another man attempted to tackle the slope in a pair of fashionable deck shoes, and no socks.

The two-minute video shows the group as 
they stumble and slip in a desperate attempt to reach the summit on the 
ice-covered Pyg Track - a route which is popular with tourists.

Despite being just yards from where two women fell 300 ft down the slippery slope last week, none of the group were wearing crampons or using ice axes, and one man even braved the wintry conditions wearing shorts.

Danger: The group were just yards from where two women fell 300 ft down the slippery slope last week

Andy Luke, founder of the Mountain Safety website, posted the video online in a bid to raise awareness about the dangers of mountain climbing.

'The path was covered in snow and ice, and if one of them had slipped then they could have fallen quite some way,' said keen mountaineer Mr Luke.

'They would have hurt themselves, thatâ€™s for sure.

'Snow on a slope spells danger and crampons an ice axe and the skills to use them are required.

'The top of Pyg Track was banked with snow and a narrow path cut through. I saw two men using crampons to descend and another couple had ice axes - they were sensible people.

Ill-equipped: None of the group were carrying ice axes or using crampons

Condition: The path was covered in snow and ice, and if one of the group had slipped then they could have fallen 'quite some way', according to experts

Aware: Andy Luke, founder of the Mountain Safety website, posted the video online in a bid to raise awareness about the dangers of mountain climbing

'Anyone venturing out should always check the weather forecast and the observed ground conditions.'

The path is close to the spot where two women slipped and fell almost 300 feet last week, leaving one of the women with serious leg injuries.

And another two men had to be rescued by volunteers after they attempted to make the ascent wearing summer boots, again without ice axes or crampons.

A Snowdonia National Park Authority spokesman said: 'Our wardens spoke to a significant number of ill-prepared people venturing out on Snowdon over the weekend.

Group: The walkers were attempting to scale the mountain, which at 3,560 ft above sea level is Wales's highest

Kitted out: Fellow walkers said the group was 'an accident waiting to happen'

'Before you begin find out what the ground conditions are like on the mountain - the wardens regularly update these via the Met Office mountain forecast.

'Have the appropriate equipment with you and dress appropriately. The weather, temperature and ground conditions can be dramatically different between the foot of the mountain and the summit.'

A spokesman from the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team said: 'For someone to go up that part of the mountain in this condition, wearing shorts, is foolish. People need to check the conditions and dress appropriately, as well as using the correct equipment.'
