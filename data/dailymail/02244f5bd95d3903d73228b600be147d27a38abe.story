Ryan Taylor returned to full training with Newcastle United on Monday following two years out through injury - and he thanked Magpies fans for their help during his recovery.

The 29-year-old midfielder suffered cruciate knee ligament damage in 2012 and was close to a return before he succumbed to a recurrence of the same injury in April 2013.

He missed the whole of the 2013-14 season but is finally back to full training at Newcastle's High Benton base.

Comeback: Ryan Taylor has returned to Newcastle United training after two years out

The versatile ex-Wigan player, who has often filled in at right-back as well as on the right side of midfield, posted on Twitter: 'What a fantastic feeling its was to be back in training this morning with the team. Moments like that are worth so much to me an my family.'

He then posted another tweet displaying his gratitude to Newcastle supporters for their continued positive messages during his time out: 'Thank you for all your support throughout my rehab, it's been much easier with the support you guys have given me.'

There were fears for Taylor's career when he ruptured his cruciate ligament for a second time but Dr Richard Steadman has ensured the midfielder can continue with his Newcastle career.

The world-famous knee surgeon was crucial in helping Magpies legend Alan Shearer and former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves recover from cruciate ligament injury.

Taylor did not spend his time out at Newcastle sitting on his hands, however.

The midfielder spent large parts of last season scouting on behalf of Toon boss Alan Pardew.
