The militant Muslim accused of the Bali bombing which killed over 200 people today apologised for the first time to victims of the atrocity.

Umar Patek, a leading member of the Al-Qaeda-linked network Jemaah Islamiyah, is standing trial in Jakarta on terrorism charges in connection with the 2002 attack which killed 202 people.

Today Patek, nicknamed 'Demolition Man' after the explosions, said sorry to the victims and their families before adding in court that he 'feels guilty' about the bombings.

Accused: Umar Patek faces terrorism and criminal charges over the Bali nightclub bombing which killed 202 people in 2002

Plea: An emotional speech by the alleged bombmaker saw Patek apologise to the bombing's victims and families

Patek admitted mixing some of the parts in the bomb's explosives, but has denied playing a major part in the attack

Patek denies playing a major role in assembling the massive car bomb that, on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2002, went off outside two nightclubs packed with foreign tourists on the busiest night of the week.

But an emotional Patek today told a courtroom: 'I still feel guilty.'

He later added: 'From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the victims and their families.'

Patek said: 'I knew about the plan. I helped mix some of the chemicals use in the explosives. ... Why didn't I inform the police?'

A suicide bomber inside one of the clubs had blown himself up, killing many people and forcing others to run outside where the vehicle loaded with the bomb was parked.

Another suicide bomber then blew that up in an attack which eventually killed 88 Australian victims and seven Americans.

After the bombings, Indonesia was thrust onto the front lines in the battle against terrorism.

Trial: Patek, pictures speaking to the court in Jakarta today, faces the death penalty if found guilty of terror and criminal charges

In court: Umar Patek, pictured in court earlier this year, is the top remaining suspect 
in the Bali nightclub bombings, which killed 202 people about a year 
after the Sept. 11 attacks and brought international attention to an 
al-Qaeda-linked group

Refusal: After the case was adjourned until earlier this year, Patek shook hands with all of the prosecutors except Rini 
Hartati, the only female team member. Ms Hartati held out her hand but 
Patek rejected it by putting his right hand on his chest

There have been several attacks targeting Western hotels, restaurants and an embassy since then. But all have been far less deadly, thanks in part, security experts say, to a relentless crackdown on Jemaah Islamiyah that has largely decimated their ranks.

Patek, who was arrested in Pakistan just over a year ago, told the court the Bali bombings were in theory meant to avenge Western policies in the Palestinian territories.

'From my point of view, it was total failure,' the suspect told the court, adding he saw 'no connection' between the original mission, fighting against the oppression of fellow Muslims, and the target, partying tourists.

'Yes, most of the victims were white, but there were no Israelis,' he said. 'Some were even Indonesian. That's a failure.'

Destroyed: Three masterminds in the Bali bombing
attack already have been tried and executed, and authorities have made 
big strides in dismantling their regional terror group, Jemaah Islamiyah

Planned: Patek left Bali a few days before the 
Oct. 12 attacks were carried out, while Imam Samudra and two other 
masterminds of the Bali attacks - brothers Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali 
Ghufron - were caught, tried and executed

Patek faces a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty of terror-related and criminal charges.

He insists he didn't play a major role in assembling the massive car bomb - saying that job fell to Jemaah Islamiyah bomb-making masterminds, Azahari bin Husin and Dulmatin, both of whom have since been killed in police raids.

'I only played a small role,' he said, acknowledging that he helped mix less than 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of nearly a ton of the chemicals used in the explosives. 'But I still feel guilty, because I was involved in an event that caused massive casualties.'

'From the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the victims and their families,' he said.

Wreckage: Patek, is accused in a string of Christmas Eve bombings at churches in Indonesia in 2000 that claimed 19 lives

Patek, nicknamed 'Demolition Man' by Indonesian investigators, escaped the country after the attack and went on a nine-year flight from justice that took him to the Philippines and Pakistan, allegedly in pursuit of more terror opportunities.

Patek was captured in January 2011 in Abbottabad, where U.S. Navy Seals would kill Osama bin Laden just a few months later. Patek was then one of Asia's most wanted terror suspects, with a $1 million bounty on his head.

The trial could shed light on what Patek was doing in Abbottabad.

Indonesia's Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro has said he was believed to be trying to meet with bin Laden, but Patek has denied that, saying he was on way to seek shelter in Afghanistan.

U.S. and Pakistan investigators have suggested Patek's stay in Abottabad was pure coincidence.
