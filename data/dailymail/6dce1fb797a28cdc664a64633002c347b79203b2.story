Ahead of the pomp and decorum of the 57th presidential inauguration next Monday, the president will hold a private swearing in from the White House the day before.

President Barack Obama will take his oath shortly before noon on Sunday in the Blue Room of the White House, administered by Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.

This is in accordance with the Constitution, which dictates that the president's term begins at noon on January 20. Since that falls on a Sunday, the public inauguration will then be held on Monday.

Taking oath: President Obama, pictured four years ago taking the oath, will first take a private oath on January 20 ahead of Monday's official inauguration, as the Constitution dictates

Location: The private oath will take place shortly before noon on Sunday, January 20 in the Blue Room of the White House

White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the event will be sparsely attended ahead of Monday's grand ceremony.

The Constitution's 20th Amendment, passed by Congress in March 1932 and ratified by the necessary states the following January, sets the inauguration date as January 20 at noon.

Because that's a Sunday this year, Obama will take the official oath of office that day in a private ceremony. A public ceremony will be held January 21 on the west front of the U.S. Capitol.

This is the seventh time the inauguration date has fallen on a Sunday. Inaugural ceremonies, however, are not traditionally held on Sundays because courts and other public institutions are closed.

Before 1933, the president had been sworn in on March 4, typically the final day of the congressional season. But the stretch between the November elections and the March 4 inauguration led to a lengthy lame-duck sessions of Congress and became a concern during times of national crisis.

Sen. George Norris, R-Neb., suggested the 20th Amendment, which called for a new Congress to begin on Jan. 3 and for the president to be inaugurated on January 20. President Franklin Roosevelt's first inauguration, in 1933, was the last swearing-in ceremony held on March 4.

Among those in the White House's Blue Room will be Obama's family will, along with a few reporters. However, Mr Obama isn't expected to make a speech.

The Constitution requires the president's term to start on January 20, but because that falls on a Sunday this year, Mr Obama will have two ceremonies: one on Sunday and a larger, public ceremony on Monday, followed by a parade and inaugural balls.

The presidential oath, as outlined in Article II, Section I is as follows: 'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.’

He has elected to use two Bibles for Monday's event – one belonging to Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other belonging to Abraham Lincoln.

Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in during a separate ceremony Sunday morning at the Naval Observatory.

Mr Obama's first inauguration marked many firsts. He was the first Hawaii-born citizen to hold the office, the first African-American to be president, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein became the first woman to emcee the ceremony.

Set up: Preparations at the reviewing stand continue today for the inauguration on Monday the 21st

Following the quiet ceremony Sunday, Mr Obama and his family will welcome in the next four years with considerable more pomp.

The first family will lead a parade of clanging bands, elaborate floats and marchers, including costumed dancers, prancing horses and military units, down Pennsylvania Avenue.

The president will dance with the first lady, whose dress seems destined to be most anticipated fashion statement of the second Obama administration.

A new element of the inaugural events will be announced next week, with the appointment of around half a dozen 'citizen co-chairs,' community leaders from across the country chosen because they represent the president's accomplishments and commitments.

They will take part in inaugural events throughout the weekend.

Estimates of turnout are 600,000 to 800,000, compared with the 1.8million in the record crowd on the National Mall four years ago to see the first swearing in of a black president.
