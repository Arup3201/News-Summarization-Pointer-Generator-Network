Lord Hanningfield is being investigated for alleged fraud over claims he cheated the Parliamentary expenses system to make up to £300 a day

Police last night confirmed a Peer was being investigated for alleged fraud over claims he cheated the Parliamentary expenses system to make up to £300 a day.

Lord Hanningfield - who was expelled from the Conservative Party after he was sent to prison for ripping off taxpayers during the original MPs’ expenses scandal - was made to repay more than £3,000 after he was caught by a newspaper ‘clocking in’ to Parliament, then leaving just minutes later, in order to claim a daily attendance allowance.

When confronted, he told a reporter: ‘I could name 50 other peers that do it.’

Police initially said there was no evidence a crime had been committed, but have now launched a new investigation.

Last night Scotland Yard confirmed the suspended peer had been interviewed under caution over allegations of fraud following the launch of a new criminal investigation.

The Daily Mirror newspaper, which first revealed the alleged fraud, said police were understood to have asked him about his claims other peers had also turned up to Parliament solely to collect the £300 tax-free allowance.

Campaigners also told the paper they believed the case could lead to major changes in the House of Lords.

Labour MP Michael McCann said: ‘If a constituent of mine clocked in and disappeared they would be sacked – no ifs, no buts. 

'If other members of the Lords have participated in this behaviour, they have to be identified and dealt with.’

Lord Kennedy told the paper: ‘It is right that police are looking again at his outrageous abuse of expenses. Here was a man who was turning up, signing in and then getting back on the Tube just a few minutes later.

‘Hanningfield will now have to name names and justify his claims about others. Any wrongdoing must be properly investigated but the vast bulk of peers would not do anything like that.’

Police first investigated Lord Hanningfield, 74, after campaigning MP John Mann wrote to police in December last year urging them to look into the newspaper claims.

Officers initially decided there was no evidence a criminal offence had been committed and instead said claims should be investigated by the Lords watchdog, the Commissioner for Standards.

Following the Commissioner’s investigation, peers backed a recommendation to suspend Lord Hanningfield until May 2015. He was also ordered to pay back £3,300 for the days he was unable to show he carried out parliamentary work.

As a result, police reviewed their original decision not to pursue the allegations and Lord Hanningfield was interviewed at an east London police station.

A Scotland Yard spokesman last night said: ‘Following the publication of the Lords Commissioner’s report in May 2014, officers conducted a thorough review of both the contents of the report and the full material available to them and a decision has been taken to instigate an investigation.

‘I can confirm a 73-year-old man attended by appointment an east London police station and was interviewed under caution in relation to an allegation of fraud.’

In 2011, Lord Hanningfield was found guilty of fiddling his expenses in a separate case and jailed for nine months. He was also expelled from the Conservative Party.

The former pig farmer was sent to prison for falsely claiming almost £14,000 for staying overnight in London on official business when he had not actually been in the capital.

He served nine-weeks of his sentence before being released with an electronic tag.
