A multi-millionaire from the East Midlands is believed to be the first person in the world to own the 'Holy Trinity' of hypercars - with a combined worth of more than £3million.

Businessman Paul Bailey already owned the £866,000 McLaren P1 and in just one day added the Porsche 918 Spyder and the LaFerrari - tripling his hypercar collection in a matter of hours.

He drove with his wife and his friend to collect the Ferrari, which he ordered two years ago, before making a 200-mile round trip to Cambridge to pick up the limited edition Porsche.

The three vehicles, which all boast top speeds of more than 200mph, are all considered to be 'hypercars' - top-tier cars whose features, price and rarity sets them apart from 'regular' supercars.

On Saturday, the grandfather-of-three drove his  McLaren supercar from his home in Rutland, East Midlands, to a Ferrari dealership in Nottingham.

There, his wife Selena, 46, got behind the wheel of the McLaren, while he drove his £1.2million Ferrari LaFerrari - a luxury car that he ordered two years ago. 

The couple, who have four children, then drove 100 miles to a Porsche dealership in Cambridge, where his friend, who was travelling with them, picked up his 918 Spyder, worth £780,000. 

Mr and Mrs Bailey, whose home in Rutland is believed to be worth more than £1million, made their fortune when they sold the communications company they founded for £28million in 2012.

'Amazing': Paul Bailey (centre) and his wife Selena on the day he picked up his Porsche 918 from the dealer

It is understood that Mr Bailey, 55, boasts a collection of some 30 supercars.

He described his fleet of hypercars as 'totally amazing'.

He said: 'I have been waiting, in real terms, about two years for the LaFerrari. Early images of these cars were snapped and emotions rose as delivery dates came closer.

'I was offered one of the first five UK cars but these did not have the level of personalisation that I have had. This is the first UK car with full personalisation and it was worth the wait. 

Only the best: Mr Bailey was offered one of the first five LaFerraris in the UK, but waited for customisation

Paul and Selena Bailey made their fortunes when they sold their phone-conferencing business in 2012.

The couple each held 45 per cent of the private shares in Worldwide Group Holdings, which was bought by telecoms firm Daisy Group for £28million. 

Founded in 2001, Worldwide Group, whose branding has since disappeared, specialised in call-handling for phone conferences, including providing free-phone numbers to conference members in different countries.

It had contracts with some of the largest players in the conferencing market, and in 2011 made £4million of earnings on revenues of £36.4million. 

Paul is now believed to be running Horsepower Racing UK. 

'I live a very surreal life and being the first to own all three does not feel real. This is why I want to use and share the cars with enthusiasts. 

'It is too early to say which is the best as they are all totally amazing. I will be able to better comment when I have driven them back to back on the race track.'

His three newest acquisitions have a combined horsepower of 2,740 and can reach 62mph in less than three seconds. They each have a top speed of more than 200mph.  

They they are part of a new breed of ultra-performance cars which use environmentally-friendly hybrid technology to achieve fuel economy of up to 94mpg. 

All three have now sold out with deliveries currently taking place around the world.

Just 375 models of the McLaren P1 have been built, while Ferrari is manufacturing 499 LaFerraris. Porsche has sold all 918 of its 918s.

Mr Bailey will be offering rides in the cars to a select few at Silverstone through Supercar Driver, a club he is a member of.

He has already raised thousands for charity by raffling off £1 tickets for people to win a go in his P1.

Adam Thorby, founder of Supercar Driver, said: 'Paul has got a cracking collection of cars and I think he is the first person to own all three of these.

'A lot of people who buys cars like this will have them hidden away but Paul is going to be driving them.

'At Supercar Driver we do a lot of events and he will be taking the cars along and letting people have rides in them.

'I think he has raised around £20,000 for charity since he got his P1 by raffling off rides in them.'
