It is just four days until the major golf contest between the U.S. and Europe  gets underway.

So, Rickie Fowler has decided to show his support for America in the 2014 Ryder Cup - by shaving the letters 'USA' into his hair.

The 25-year-old golfer, who is making his second appearance in the biennial competition, proudly showed off his new haircut during practice today.

He took off his cap to reveal 'USA' shaved into the hair behind his right ear, before pointing out the patriotic design to photographers.

New haircut: Rickie Fowler has shown his support for America in the Ryder Cup - by shaving 'USA' into his hair

Proud: The 25-year-old golfer, who is making his second appearance in the biennial competition this week, took off his cap at practice today, before pointing out his new patriotic hairstyle (left and right) to photographers

Fowler, from Murrieta, California, arrived at Edinburgh Airport with the U.S. team this morning, with captain Tom Watson giving  a thumbs-up as he stepped off the plane.

Watson later gave his thoughts on Fowler's haircut as he sat alongside his European counterpart Paul McGinley at the captains' press conference at Gleneagles.

He told the conference: 'I thought it was great, terrific. It brings a light spirit to the team.

'I wouldn't be surprised if, heck, even Ted Bishop [the 60-year-old president of the PGA of America] puts 'USA' on the side of his head if it means we are going to win.'

Home skipper McGinley, from Dublin, agreed, saying: 'That's brilliant. I think the guy is so passionate about his country that he will go and do that for the Ryder Cup.'

Fowler, who is an almost entirely self-taught golfer, was ranked the number one amateur in the world for 36 weeks in 2007 and 2008.

Europe have won seven of the last nine Ryder Cups. Led by world number one Rory McIlroy, they are the favorites to triumph again in the 40th edition at Gleneagles.  

Yesterday, McIllroy said winning the international competition would be 'the icing on the cake' of an incredible year for him.

The golfer, who heads to Gleneagles with his European team-mates this week, has won four tournaments in the last five months, including the Open and the US PGA Championship.

He told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme: 'Personally for me it would just be the icing on the cake of what's already a fantastic year.

'It feels like everyone involved is just so passionate about it, and even the public get so much more passionate about it than the majors or individual tournaments.

'So it's great to be a part of; I've been a part of two winning European teams and obviously would love to make that a third this week.'

McIlroy helped Europe lift the cup in 2010 and 2012 and the 25-year-old revealed they were the best experiences of his career as he was able to celebrate victory as part of a team. 

The Ryder Cup, the biggest grudge match in golf, gets underway on Friday morning with four fourball encounters.
