A 15-year-old boy has been arrested after suspected explosive substances were found at a house sparking a large-scale bomb disposal operation.

After 15 hours, army ballistic experts remain outside the cordoned-off house and neighbours have been evacuated.

A team of soldiers, police, firefighters and paramedics was called to the terraced council house in Hull after an anonymous tip-off at 2.49 this morning.

Raid: Armed officers burst into the property on Kilnsea Grove in Hull, arresting a boy, 15, and two adults

Neighbours were evacuated as armed officers entered the property.

The teenager was detained as well as a 49-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man.

More than 15 hours later, the multi-agency operation is still ongoing in Kilnsea Grove, east of the city.

A blue forensics tent is stood outside the property with a number of police cars and fire engines.

Earlier, dozens of people living in the area gathered behind the police cordon to watch the soldiers go into the property.

One man said: 'I can't believe what descended on us. There's army, police, ambulances, four-wheel drive ambulances, fire engines. Everything's here.

'They came in the middle of the night after a tip-off about stuff in the house. Then all hell broke loose. I've not seen anything like it.'

Another Kilnsea Grove resident said: 'They've just said they've found explosives inside and we're to stay well away.

'They've got everyone out just in case. You can't be too careful.'

A Humberside Police spokesman said they received a call at 2.49am today and confirmed they were 'investigating a report of substance(s) which are believed to be inside a residential property'.

Police vans, fire engines and bomb disposal experts remain outside the cordoned-off house 15 hours later

The spokesman said the Army's Explosives Ordnance Disposal Unit had been deployed as part of a multi-agency response.

Detective Inspector Jason Gourley said: 'Our officers arrived at an address in east Hull in the early hours of today.

'Since then, we have arrested three people who are currently assisting us with our enquiries in connection with substances believed to be at a property on Kilnsea Grove.

'We are working closely with our partner agencies to ensure the area is safe for the local community, which is why we have put a cordon in place.

'We hope that residents can return to their properties as quickly as possible, but public safety is paramount, so we hope that everyone will obey the police cordons and we will let them know when the police has finished carrying out all relevant enquiries.'

The incident is not being treated as terrorist-related, police said.
