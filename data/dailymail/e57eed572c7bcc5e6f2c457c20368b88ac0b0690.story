A patient at a Brooklyn hospital viciously beat his 69-year-old nurse on Friday for no reason - leaving her battling for her life.

Kwincii Jones, 40, allegedly attacked Evelyn Lynch after she went to remove his catheter inside his private room at around 4.30pm at the Brookdale University Hospital.

She was transported to Kings County Hospital Center after Jones struck her head and knocked her to the floor, kicking her face and head, putting her in a critical condition.

Attack: Evelyn Lynch is fighting for her life after being set upon by Kwincii Jones at the Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn on Friday

She later underwent brain surgery and is facing a long road to recovery after she was knocked unconscious and suffered severe facial fractures.

'The whole family believe that, they are very distraught over this, and we're asking for all the prayers we can get,' family friend Dr. Marvo Forde said.

'We never expected that in a place she is caring for a patient that it would happen.'

Others were shocked that such a brutal beating could take place inside the hospital complex.

'I actually hear she was a sweet old lady,' one Brookdale employee told CBS 2.

'That’s why it’s a little weird to me because I don’t know why it would happen. It’s not like she was mean or anything like that.'

Shock: Friends and colleagues said that Evelyn had worked at the medical center for decades and that the vicious beating was horrifying

Another friend and staff colleague of Lynch's said that a fellow nurse may have heard the commotion and called for help which arrived swiftly.

After his beating was halted he rushed into a bathroom where he remained until police officers arrived and forced him out.

He was taken to the 67th Precinct police station on Saturday where he now faces second-degree assault and attempted murder charges.

'He hasn’t been charged yet, but he’s in our custody,' a police source said Friday night.

Hospital officials say Lynch has been working at Brookdale Medical Center for decades.

'We are very saddened and shocked by this incident,' a statement released by the hospital says.

'Our staff comes to work each day to serve the community and we expect that the respect we show are patients to be returned in kind.'
