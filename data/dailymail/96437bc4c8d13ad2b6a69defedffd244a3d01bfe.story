A female Tory Minister made a spoof Commons speech on animal welfare in order to say an obscene word after a dare at a dinner with Navy officer friends.

Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt said ‘c**k’ six times, ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times and mentioned the names of at least six officers during a debate on poultry welfare.

Her speech, recorded in full in Parliament’s Hansard official report and broadcast on television, received a formal reply from a fellow Minister, who believed her interest in the subject was genuine. 

Speaker John Bercow was also duped, making copious notes as Naval Reservist Ms Mordaunt addressed the House.

While other MPs used the same debating session to raise grave issues such as the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and the Mid-Staffordshire hospital scandal, Portsmouth MP Ms Mordaunt made the rude speech to titillate bawdy Royal Marines who had ‘fined’ her at a mess dinner.

After making the speech, she proudly contacted the Marines to tell them she had done it.

Ms Mordaunt, who took part in ITV’s diving contest Splash! earlier this year, was accused last night of trivialising Parliament. 

Former Labour Minister Kate Hoey said: ‘She should realise that the House of Commons is not a TV reality show.

‘The public expects debates in the Chamber to be on matters of serious concern. It is sad that she has misused it in this way – it sets a bad precedent.’

But Ms Mordaunt, 41, remained apparently unconcerned, saying: ‘If I have offended anyone I’m sorry. Feel free to beat me up over it.’

The publicity-seeking MP confessed to the stunt while receiving an award last week at The Spectator magazine’s Parliamentarian of the Year Awards at London’s Savoy Hotel. Her prize was for a speech earlier this year during which she uttered the words ‘penis’ and ‘testicles’. 

Explaining how the ‘c**k’ speech came about, she told the Spectator event: ‘Some of my Marine training officers at Dartmouth thought it would be a good idea to break my ladylike persona by getting me to yell particular rude words during the most gruelling part of our training.

‘They failed, but during our mess dinner at the end of the course, I was fined for a misdemeanour. The fine was to say a particular word, an abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor of the Commons, and mention all the names of the officers present.’

Ms Mordaunt, who is divorced, took up the challenge and a few weeks later settled the bet in a debate on Parliament’s Easter Adjournment.

‘The cause of hen and cock welfare is raised with me by many constituents,’ she declared with a straight face as she delivered her Commons speech. 

‘One strutting coxcomb will lead to many chicks and what is to become of the male contingent with not a layer among them?’ She could not suppress a grin when she said ‘c**k’ for a third time.

She went on to discuss the plight of ‘end-of-lay birds’ and ended with a smutty pun disguised as a genuine call for action: ‘Let us have no more cock-ups on hen welfare.’

Ms Mordaunt’s references included ‘cock crow’, ‘cock welfare’, ‘cock-a-hoop’, ‘cockerel’ and ‘cock-ups’. Her references to ‘lay’ included ‘laying hens of pensionable age’, and ‘end-of-lay bird’.

Ms Mordaunt’s Marine pals would have been able to watch the speech, on March 26, 2013, live on the Parliamentary TV channel, where it is still available.

The MP was criticised last night by Labour’s Sheila Gilmore, who has genuinely campaigned to improve poultry welfare. 

‘It is an issue that many people, including me, take seriously. MPs are entitled to a sense of humour but this kind of thing trivialises Parliament,’ she said.

At the Spectator awards, Ms Mordaunt suggested it was obvious her ‘poultry welfare’ speech was a prank, saying her main political interest was the Navy.

However, she changed her tune last night, claiming she had ‘done quite a bit on animal welfare’, adding: ‘I didn’t make the speech just to make those remarks.’

The Armed Forces runs in the blood of paratrooper’s daughter Ms Mordaunt, who was named after Navy frigate HMS Penelope.

She was given a ministerial post in July after David Cameron called her a ‘parliamentary star’.

Penny Mordaunt first tested the boundaries of Commons propriety in June when she became the first woman ever to mention testicles in the Chamber.

Ms Mordaunt, who at that stage was still best known for being voted ‘Britain’s sexiest MP’ and taking part in ITV’s celebrity diving contest Splash!, brought the house down with a riotously successful ‘loyal address’ – the thank you motion to the Queen following her speech to open Parliament.

MPs roared with laughter as the MP told an anecdote about her naval training which included advice on ‘how to care for your penis and testicles in the field’. The sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, who was elected MP for Portsmouth North in 2010, is the daughter of a paratrooper-turned-teacher.

Her mother died of breast cancer when Ms Mordaunt was 15 – the same year her father was also diagnosed with cancer – turning her into a ‘child carer’. She took a job as a magician’s assistant to fund her way through college, which involved her being ‘sawn in half’.

In interviews to publicise Splash!, she told of a ‘life-changing’ year working in Romanian orphanages, before going to university to study philosophy, and that she has a gay twin brother. 

The only mention of her personal life was that she lives with her partner Ian Lyon – a classical singer, Burmese cat breeder and director of an IT firm – and eight cats. A marriage certificate unearthed by The Mail on Sunday this year showed that when she was 26 she had a brief marriage to Paul Murray, whom she met while they were students.
