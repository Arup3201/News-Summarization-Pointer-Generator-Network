Atletico Madrid will have Diego Simeone back on the touchline as they attempt to put their Champions League campaign back on course. 

If his return to the dug-out has the same effect it had on Saturday in the league then Juventus have a long night ahead.

The communion between the Calderon and the man they call El Cholo is, at present, greater than the bond between any manager and his home fans, and his return from a six-match suspension at the weekend helped inspire a 4-0 win over Sevilla.

Simeone's name was sung before the start of Saturday's game, hundreds of photographers surrounded him as he took his place on the bench, and when the show began the Argentine coach put in his usual shift, constantly on his feet pointing, correcting and encouraging with that contagious energy that inspires his team but has also seen him fall foul of the game's governing bodies in recent matches.

His Liga ban was for tapping the fourth official on the back of the head in the Spanish Super Cup second leg. His ban in Europe came from going on to the pitch in the European Cup final seeking out Real Madrid's Rafael Varane.

In his absence Atletico had dropped two important home points in the league against Celta Vigo and lost to Olympiacos in their first group match in the Champions League.

Tonight they will be at full strength on and off the pitch as Juventus come to town.

The Italians beat Atlanta 3-0 at the weekend to maintain their 100 percent record. Carlos Tevez will lead the line for them tonight and former Atletico youth-teamer and Real Madrid player Alvaro Morata should also feature.

Of Tevez, Simeone said: 'He is an extraordinary player. The closer he is to goal the more he comes alive. We have to make sure that he has no time to think and that he can never comfortably receive the ball in time and space.'

The Argentine manager's return to domestic competition coincided with a 4-0 rout of Sevilla 

Atletico Madrid will not name their playing squad until just hours before the game but Simeone did confirm that Miguel Moya will start in goal ahead of Jan Oblak who let in three against Olympiacos in the first group game. Captain Gabi is almost definitely out with Koke like to move back to holding midfield alongside Tiago behind a Raul Garcia, Arda Turan and Antoine Greizmann.

Simeone has vowed to try to keep his temper under control on the touchline to avoid another ban. 'You feel helpless up in the stands' he said after a frustrating night in the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium against the Greek Champions two weeks ago.

That defeat has heaped the pressure on last year's finalists. 'This is a final' said Simeone ahead of what should be another raucous night in Madrid against currently the best side in Italy.
