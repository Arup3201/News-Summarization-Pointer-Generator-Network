Victim: Stephanie Atha, 23, suffered horrendous facial injuries when she was punched and kicked for several minutes by two men who tried to steal her iPhone

A nursing assistant suffered horrendous facial injuries after she was punched and kicked for several minutes by two men who tried to steal her iPhone.

Stephanie Atha, 23, was walking home 
alone from her hospital job when she was approached by two men who went to snatch her mobile 
before punching her in the face.

Police were today hunting the attempted robbery suspects who struck as the nursing assistant took a cut through route to her home in Guisborough, North Yorkshire.

'One went to grab my phone in my hand and I thought he was joking at first,' said Miss Atha.

She said that the two men had tried to grab the phone and when she moved it out of reach one of them hit her in the face, knocking her to the ground.

'It was on a slope and muddy and I 
slipped somehow and landed on the floor,' said Miss Atha, who works at 
West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough.

As she lay on the ground the men continued to try to take the phone, kicking her and punching her as they hurled abuse at Miss Atha and called her offensive names in the attack 
that lasted several minutes.

Miss Atha had finished her evening shift at the hospital and had caught the bus to Guisborough from Middlesbrough, arriving back shortly before 11pm on Saturday, May 24 when she commenced her walk home.

'I’ve walked that same route hundreds of times,' said Miss Atha, who still has painful bruising to her ribs, legs and face.

'It’s badly lit but it never bothered me walking anywhere.

'I didn’t expect it to happen, it’s only five or ten minutes from home.'

Miss Atha, who lives with her mother and sister Aimee, 22, says she owes her work training for helping her to get away from her attackers.

'With my job in children’s mental health you learn restraints and how to defend yourself,' she said.

'So I curled up in a ball.

'I managed to defend myself. I managed to shove one of them. I did fight back. I’m glad I got out of it. I ran all the way home.'

Miss Atha's mother Angela, who is terminally ill, said: 'It was awful. I was in the hospice when it happened and I got a phone call off her sobbing down the phone.

'I felt so helpless. I managed to calm her down and I told her to phone the police as soon as she got off the phone to me.'

Miss Atha said police arrived within 15 minutes, and that her sister had dashed home to look after her.

She says she is terrified to leave the house and has only ventured out to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough with her boyfriend, Callum Terry, 18, and to see her GP.

'I just feel very anxious when I’m out of the house and that’s not me at all,' she said.

'I hope I can get justice and I hope the police find them and they get jailed and realise how far they’ve taken it.'

Miss Atha, who is on sick leave while she recovers from her ordeal at home, added she wouldn’t be walking the same route again.

Police said the first suspect was white, around 5ft 3ins, in his early 20s, of slim build and had short dark hair with stubble. He was wearing a dark tracksuit top and trousers.

The second man was also wearing a dark tracksuit top and trousers.
