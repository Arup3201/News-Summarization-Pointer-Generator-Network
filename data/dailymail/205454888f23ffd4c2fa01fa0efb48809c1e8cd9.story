Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar last night after Spanish police fired shots at a British jet-skier in waters around the Rock.

In an extraordinary incident, a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode his jet-ski close to a popular beach.

Mr Villa is not wanted for any particular crime and is not thought to have strayed out of British waters into Spanish territory – although the line between the two is far from clear to people in the sea.

Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar after Spanish police fired shots at British jet-skier Dale Villa, pictured, in waters around the Rock

The Gibraltar government has called on the UK to bring the matter up with Spain on the 'highest diplomatic and military levels' after four Spanish fighter planes allegedly entered its airspace

Foreign Office minister David 
Lidington condemned the shooting as ‘completely unacceptable’ and called
 on Spain to take action against those responsible.

He said he had confronted his Spanish counterpart Inigo Mendez de Vigo yesterday to protest ‘in the strongest possible terms’.

Mr
 Lidington added: ‘I made it clear that the discharge of a weapon in or 
near Gibraltar is completely unacceptable. I urged Mr Mendez de Vigo to 
investigate urgently and to take action to ensure this will not happen 
again.’

Father-of-three Mr 
Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he
 tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon.

‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver.

‘When
 a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very 
scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of 
them with a gun in his hand.

Worrying: The jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the Guardia Civil vessel

‘I was just about to drop my friend off at West Beach when I heard the first shot.

‘I don’t really think we took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was.

‘I
 jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was 
chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me.

‘I
 had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin 
and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being 
threatening or doing anything wrong.

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain.

Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty.

Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory.

The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy.

Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own 
affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the 
responsibility of the UK Government.

Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.

‘Maybe
 these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something
 is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’ Shots can be heard 
on a grainy video filmed by a witness. British sources said it was 
thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man.

Witness
 Simy Herbert described the Guardia Civil as ‘trigger-happy’, adding: 
‘The Foreign Office has to do something now because when someone is shot
 in our waters then everybody will start flapping.’

The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital.

The
 incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from
 the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation. 
But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no 
incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’.

 Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty.

British
 sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its 
waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From 
December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions 
by Spanish boats.

Last 
November, Madrid was accused of an unlawful incursion into Britain’s 
territorial waters after a Spanish warship called Vencedora, a 288ft 
corvette, came within three miles of Gibraltar’s coast.

The ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and HMS Scimitar, a seven-man patrol boat, was scrambled to intercept.

Gibraltar
 Chief Minister Fabian Picardo described the incident as a ‘scandalous 
act of aggression which is illegal, imprudent, unprofessional and 
irresponsible’.

Action: Following the shooting, a Royal Navy Rib similar to this intercepted the Rio Cedena and told it to leave the waters

Incident: The Rio Cedena boat which the shots were fired from is similar to this Guardia Civil boat

In a joint 
statement, Tory MEPs Giles Chichester, Ashley Fox and Julie Girling – 
who represent Gibraltar in the European Parliament – said Spanish 
provocation was ‘a form of international political posturing by a 
struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its 
domestic failures’.

They 
added: ‘For a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence 
caused to the people of Gibraltar.

'This action is wholly illegal and as 
provocative as it is reckless.’
