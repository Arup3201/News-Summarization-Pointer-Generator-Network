The Franco-German aerospace giant which plans to take over BAE Systems benefited from almost £56million of tax credits from the UK government – while paying just £10.5million in tax.

This is despite EADS raking in more than £3billion in revenues from its British operations during 2010, according to corporate documents seen by the Daily Mail.

They also reveal a complex global maze of 276 EADS offshoots, including a string of ventures based in tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands and Jersey.

EADS, whose headquarters are in the Netherlands, also runs subsidiaries in the low-tax Republic of Ireland.

The firm, which employs 17,000 staff in Britain, is currently in talks over a  £31billion deal to merge with the former British Aerospace.

The revelations have sparked fears that BAE’s contributions to Government coffers could dry up after it is folded into EADS, which owns Airbus.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘Here’s another example of a UK company fleeing our shores for foreign ownership with the inevitable consequence that less tax will be paid in the UK.

‘We’ll be paying for the fighter jets and they’ll be making no contribution. It’s time to change our tax system to make sure every company pays fair tax where it really earns its profits.’

According to its own accounts, EADS carves up its operations into subsidiaries, with each one a separately registered company. It boasts 31 such operations in the UK – each one paying a different amount of tax.

Some have not updated their records since 2010.

If all of its British arms were put together, the company made a pre-tax loss of £166million during 2010 in the UK and received a tax credit of £46million.

Some divisions paid no tax at all, while many of the others paid less than full corporation tax, which in 2010 was charged at 28 per cent.

Documents filed at Companies House show that Airbus Operations Limited, its main UK division employing 10,000 workers, made a £206million loss in 2010 despite making sales of £2.4billion.

The firm received a generous £56million in tax credits from the Chancellor, relating to a ‘deferred tax credit’. Other divisions paid just a tiny amount of tax.

One, Cimpa Limited, reported £5.5million in turnover and £66,000 in  profits. But it contributed a miserly £254 to the taxman – a tax rate of just 0.003 per cent and the same as anyone earning £7,745 in Britain during 2010.

Another arm, Cassidian Test and Services Limited, made a pre-tax profit of £525,000 yet only paid £6,224 to HM Revenues & Customs.

The EADS UK Limited division, which deals with offices and services, had revenues of £23million yet made a loss of £1.5million.

It paid just £14,000 in tax during 2010 relating to a prior year.

Other UK arms also saw vast  revenue streams evaporate into tiny profits.

Further afield, the EADS has a string of operations based in the Cayman Islands, which is renowned for its status as a tax haven.

It is not believed that EADS has any material operations – such as assembly plants, factories or research facilities – there.

EADS has its corporate headquarters in Leiden in the Netherlands, despite being part-owned by the French, German and Spanish governments.

It is not known whether the merged company, including BAE, would move its tax domicile there.

BAE is currently registered in London.

In most large companies, some offshoots pay tax, others do not and some receive tax credits or refunds from the government, so money flows both ways between the firm and the tax authorities.

EADS has 31 UK subsidiaries but a number are holding companies and do not file accounts or pay tax.

According to the latest figures available, firms based in the UK paid a total of just under £10.5million in corporation tax in 2010.

But the largest British  business, loss-making Airbus Operations Limited, received a tax credit of £56million.

Two military satellite subsidiaries received tax credits of just over £304,000.

These credits far outweighed the payments made to the Exchequer, meaning that overall EADS’s UK operations were nearly £46million to the good in their dealings with HMRC.

Jim Moohan, of the union GMB, who represents the engineering and shipbuilding industry in Scotland, said: ‘The public purse could pay a massive price.

‘We need proper sound judgment from all the political parties so that they look after the nation’s long-term interests.

‘Caution should certainly apply to where the company is registered, how it is controlled and the taxation aspects, as so much of the skills needed for the defence of our nation are tied up with this firm.

‘The fear of mergers is that there will be downsizing and the public purse might have to pick up the tab for lost jobs as well.’

Ian Waddell, Unite’s national officer for aerospace, said: ‘We believe all companies should pay their fair tax. This raises questions that need to be answered.’

A spokesman for EADS in the UK said: ‘We pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries in which we operate.’

He added that the group has created 4,000 UK jobs since 2007 and is the largest exporter of commercial aircraft from Britain.

Wants merger: David Cameron has been dealt a serious blow in his attempt to see through the deal to merge BAE Systems with EADS after a revolt by shareholders

David Cameron’s hopes of pushing through Britain’s biggest defence deal were hit by a series of setbacks yesterday as anger spread about the threat to jobs and national security.

Shareholders staged a revolt over  plans to merge BAE Systems with Franco-German aviation firm EADS, demanding a say over the deal.

In a further blow, Labour politicians said they will not back the deal unless they receive reassurances that British BAE jobs are safe and a guarantee the US will not ditch its defence contracts.

Senior government sources also warned  last night that No 10 will have to fight  proposals by France and Germany to grab a controlling interest in the new firm.

The UK Shareholders’ Association has written open letters to BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver and Sir Peter Mason, its senior independent director, asking them to ensure that private investors in BAE can vote on the proposed merge.

One MP in touch with the biggest personal shareholders said: ‘They don’t like the deal. They don’t see the logic of it.’ 

Eric Chalker, policy co-ordinator of the UKSA, added: ‘To listen to politicians, one might think this proposed merger will be decided by governments, as there has been almost no reference to shareholders – those who actually own the business.’ 

He said it was ‘shocking’ that many private shareholders who keep shares in ISAs and pension funds have no voting rights.

Security fears: In a further blow, Labour has demanded reassurances that jobs will be safe at BAE, which makes the Typhoon Eurofighter jet (above)

The Prime Minister is supportive of the merger and officials had hoped it will be approved in the next couple of weeks.

But now the French and German governments want the right to buy shares in EADS - something which is unacceptable to Downing Street, the Department of Business and the Ministry of Defence.

A No 10 source said: ‘We have very strict red lines and we aren’t coming off them.’ The Government is backing the deal because it will allow BAE to win a foothold in the lucrative European defence market and the civil aviation arena.

Three sources in Germany familiar with the negotiations said last night that it was likely the deal would now collapse.
