Speaking out: Christiana Figueres sparked fury yesterday by claiming that the devastating winter storms that have battered Britain had a 'silver lining'

The devastating winter storms that have battered Britain had a ‘silver lining’ in raising the issue of climate change, the UN claimed yesterday.

Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate change chief, sparked fury by making a political point out of storms which flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation.

And Miss Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, added there was also an upside to the blast of Arctic air that blanketed America and Canada in snow, and the Australian bushfires, because they have forced climate change back on to the political agenda.

‘There’s no doubt that these events, that I call experiential evidence of climate change, does raise the issue to the highest political levels,’ she told the Guardian.

‘It’s unfortunate that we have to have these weather events, but there is a silver lining if you wish, that they remind us [that] solving climate change, addressing climate change in a timely way, is not a partisan issue.’ 

The floods have cost small businesses more than £830million, it emerged yesterday, and £170million of damage has been done to railway lines. The clear-up will cost billions.

Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater constituency in Somerset has borne the brunt of the flooding, said last night: ‘It is a complete insult to have this unelected, overpaid UN bureaucrat making glib comments at the expense of my constituents.

'She hasn’t visited us here in Somerset, she knows nothing about what has happened here. She is taking advantage of this situation for political capital.

‘Apart from anything else, what she says is absolute rubbish. There is no evidence this  is anything to do with climate change.’ 

The Met Office has repeatedly pointed out that the winter storms cannot be attributed to global warming, although extreme rainfall ‘could be consistent’ with a warming world in the future.

In a document addressing the issue, it said: ‘As yet, there is no definitive answer on the possible contribution of climate change to the recent storms, rainfall amounts and the consequent flooding.

‘This is in part due to the highly variable nature of UK weather and climate.’

Miss Figueres, who hails from Costa Rica, is leading the charge for a legally binding international agreement to reduce carbon emissions.

After two decades of failure to reach a consensus, the UN is determined to finalise a deal at a conference in Paris next year.

She said: ‘Paris has to reach a meaningful agreement because, frankly, we are running out of time.’ 

Miss Figueres was speaking before an event in London, where she was due to meet major businesses including Unilever, Lafarge and Royal Dutch Shell.
