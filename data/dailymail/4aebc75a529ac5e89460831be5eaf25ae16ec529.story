Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Bournemouth have never beaten Liverpool in a competitive match, losing three and drawing two.

The Reds have scored in 14 of their last 15 League Cup quarter-final clashes (incl. replays).

Liverpool have won seven and lost none of their last 10 Capital One Cup matches (in normal & extra time) against lower ranked sides.

The Cherries will be making their first ever appearance in the quarter-finals of the League Cup.

Dan Gosling has scored four goals and provided one assist in four League Cup games this term.

Liverpool have won six of their last seven away games in the League Cup, though they lost the most recent fixture against Manchester United in September 2013 (Round 3).

Bournemouth’s victory against West Brom in the previous round was their first win over a higher ranked side in 17 League Cup games (D6 L10).

Indeed, they’ve conceded in each of their last 12 League Cup games against sides from a higher division.
