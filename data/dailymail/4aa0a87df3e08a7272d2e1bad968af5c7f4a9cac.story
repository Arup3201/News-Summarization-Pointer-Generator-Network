This is the moment a plane passenger filmed a 'UFO' speeding beneath his aircraft over Iran.

The incredible footage shows a mysterious circular object moving at a steady pace through heavy clouds somewhere over the centre of the West Asian country.

The shape and movement of the object suggests it could well be a drone - possibly operated by the Iranian military - although the clip has led to speculation that it may be an extraterrestrial craft.

The 34 second clip was filmed out the window of a passenger plane as it travelled over Iran.

It shows a large white object flying several hundred feet below the aircraft, moving steadily through the clouds from right to left. 

Shaped like a disc, the fast-moving object does not resemble another plane, nor could it be mistaken for a helicopter. 

It also doesn't appear to have any of the markings or lighting systems other aircraft have. 

As it moves across the sky, the mysterious object appears to grow fuzzy around the edges before disappearing out of shot.

Despite speculation that the object may be an alien craft, the most likely explanation is that it is high tech drone being operated by the Iranian military. 

Earlier this week Iran carried out the first test flight of a drone aircraft it copied from a U.S. craft captured in 2011.

'We promised that a model of RQ-170 would fly in the second half of the year, and this has happened. A film of the flight will be released soon,' Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh told the state-run IRNA agency.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also expressed content at the test flight, describing it as 'sweet and unforgettable' in a video published by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

Photographs of Iran's high-tech RQ-170 drone - which is white and disc-shaped - were first revealed in August.
