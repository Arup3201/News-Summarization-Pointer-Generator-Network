Lewis 
Hamilton continued the 
festivities that accompanied his victory at Silverstone by spending time
 with his engineers and mechanics — and the real gold trophy that goes 
to the winner of the British Grand Prix — at Mercedes’ factory in 
Brackley on Monday

He was greeted 
by a standing ovation from 500 or so staff and was sportingly applauded 
by Nico Rosberg, his team-mate and World Championship rival.

But
 Hamilton revealed that some of the biggest support he received over a 
tumultuous weekend came from another English hero of the track, Nigel 
Mansell.

The four-time winner of the British Grand Prix was a 
consoling influence after Hamilton’s mistake in qualifying consigned him
 to start from sixth on the grid.

‘Nigel has been massively supportive this weekend and this year,’ said Hamilton. ‘I can’t believe how good it is to have his support after watching him when I was really young and seeing what he had achieved.

‘He said hello to me on the grid, just saying that he was proud of me and was rooting for me. It was really cool. Of all the past drivers, his support has meant the most.’

Hamilton’s win, which was a formality after Rosberg retired with gearbox failure, took him to 27 career wins, level with Sir Jackie Stewart. Hamilton accomplished the feat in 138 races; Stewart in 99. Only one British driver, Mansell, has won more often: 31 times (in 187 races), a record that Hamilton is almost certain to overtake, conceivably this season.

‘I want to win the World Championship so I am not focused on that part, but just to be among those drivers is huge privilege,’ said Hamilton, who was happy to have the gold RAC Trophy with him yesterday, having been dismayed to be presented with a plastic sponsor trophy on Sunday.

‘Looking at that trophy and seeing Nigel and (James) Hunt, (Jim) Clark and all the greats on there is so cool. They don’t have my name on it, I don’t know why — there’s no space.’ The scenes of jubilation at Silverstone were an echo of the Mansell-mania of the Eighties and Nineties.

Hamilton reacts to acclaim and criticism 
more sensitively than most drivers — ‘positive energy’ is one of his 
favoured phrases — so the Silverstone fillip is important ahead of Rosberg’s home race at Hockenheim, Germany in a fortnight.

As 
Hamilton pointed out, Rosberg is not a thoroughgoing, lederhosen-wearing
 German. His father Keke is Finnish and he lives in Monaco, though his 
mother Sina is German and her country is the one for which he has 
competed in Formula One.

‘Nico has never actually been in Germany, so it is not really his home race,’ said Hamilton.

‘When
 I was racing in karting he didn’t stand next to a German flag ever, 
ever. They would go on the start line and all the drivers would have to 
stand next to the grid girl. The girls would be holding the flag or the 
sign saying Hungary or whatever and he always stood by Monaco.’

Hamilton’s
 win at Silverstone took him from 29 points to four points behind 
Rosberg in the standings, with nine of the 19 races completed.

He said, with relief: ‘I’ve been on the back foot since the first race (when he retired with technical trouble).

‘Reliability
 is going to be a key part. You just never know when you are going to 
have a problem. Who would have known that Nico would have had one at 
Silverstone?’

Both Hamilton and Rosberg will test at Silverstone this
 week but Kimi Raikkonen, of Ferrari, will be absent after suffering 
ankle and knee injuries in his 47G crash on Sunday. He hopes to return 
for Rosberg’s ‘home’ race on Sunday week.

Young F1 fans were treated to exclusive behind-the-scenes tour of the Silverstone Paddock, where they met drivers including Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian 
Vettel and Max Chilton.

The trip was organised for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity as part of its ongoing relationship with F1.

Last week the F1 Party at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum raised more than £900,000 towards a much needed new surgery centre at the hospital.

Over the past decade, the charity’s partnership with the F1 community has raised more than £4 million.
