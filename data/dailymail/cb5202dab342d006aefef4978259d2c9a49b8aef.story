As a young Afghanistan soldier is enthusiastically welcomed home, one member of his family is overcome with emotion and excitement - his beloved pet dog.

The heartwarming video of the soldier's welcome from his deliriously happy pup has gone viral.

The dog, called Jasmine, which looks like a black and tan Hovawart, can't contain her excitement on seeing her owner who was in Afghanistan for a year.

As the newly-returned soldier, known only as Josh enters a garage to greet the dog - her reaction is crazy.

Emotional: The pet dog of an Afghanistan soldier gives him an excited welcome home. Jasmine couldn't contain her joy on seeing Josh returned safe to the U.S.

Howling and barking, Jasmine, bounds over to him, jumping wildly up onto his uniform, trying to lick his face.

Despite polite protestations from the soldier the delighted pet refuses to leave his side as he rubs and tickles her, eventually jumping again and forcing him over on the floor.

The video has spread across the internet since it was posted on the Armed Forces website, www.welcomehomeblog.com.

A brief description is posted alongside it but no further information is available on the family involved.

The woman who posted the video, who is named only as Linda P, said 
the soldier is her daughter's boyfriend and they had been caring for his
pet while he was on active service with the Army Reserves Task Force.  

Man's best friend: The Afghanistan soldier's pet dog has clearly missed him a lot following his year of active service. She refuses to leave his side in the video and wants to be continually petted by her beloved owner

Absence makes the heart grow fonder: Jasmine can't control her excitement on the safe return of her owner, soldier Josh. He was serving in Afghanistan for a year

'Josh had last seen her in October of 2011, when he came home on leave. He returned to the states in March 2012. Jasmine is a well-behaved dog who loves her master, whining and snuggling when she sees him, getting very excited and as close as she can to Josh. Our dog, Sheba, doesn’t know what to do as Jasmine runs around, so excited about Josh’s return.'

Laughter can be heard on the video as Josh battles to move away but Jasmine refuses to let him be.

'She doesn't know what to do', a voice is heard through laughter in the background.

Showing the pet really is his best friend, Josh then walks the dog out of the garage and gets her to excitedly roll over with just the click of his fingers.

Several people have posted the video across the internet. 

One viewer wrote: 'Aw that's so cute...I am in awe on how loyal dogs are to their owners and are able to express so much happiness.'

Other pets welcoming returning soldiers have made moving online videos.

In 2009 golden retriever Gracie was a Youtube hit following a video of welcome home for owner Lieutenant Andrew Schmidt in Springfield, Virginia being posted.

Chuck the boxer was an Internet star in March - he was so excited to meet owner, a Marine called Nick, he jumps out of the car trunk and knocks his sunglasses off.
