A leading French politician plotted to wreck a rival's career by luring him into having sex with an underage girl in Morocco, it was claimed today.

Senator Jean-Louis Masson has accused fellow senator Francois Grosdidier of hatching the plan to have him expelled from France's upper house of parliament.

He claims to have a tape recording in which 52-year-old Grosdidier plots with a pal to frame him with the bizarre honeytrap.

J'accuse! French senator Francois Grosdidier (left) is accused of trying to have fellow senator Jean-Louis Masson (right) expelled from France's upper house of Parliament by using an underage girl as a honeytrap. Â 

'We'll catch him like a rabbit': The pair plotted to trap the rival in Morocco (pictured)

Both men are right wing UMP senators in the eastern department of Moselle and are said to have been feuding with each other for two decades.

The rivalry - dubbed Dallas in Moselle by the French media - is said to have begun in the 1990s over council tenders for work in their neighbouring constituencies.

Masson, 65, said the recording was passed onto him by 'an associate' two years ago, but he had decided not to make it public until now.

On the tape which Masson has now released to the French media, Grosdidier is heard telling another man: 'That's the only thing that's left for us to do: trick him with a minor.'

Had the set-up had been successful, it would have resembled the case of former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi (left), who had sex with Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug (right)

The second man replies: 'Let's go for Morocco, we'll catch him like a rabbit.'

Grosdidier answers: 'As soon at the story gets out, I'll get in touch with the state secretary at the ministry of the interior and tell him, 'Listen, don't protect him, he's the worst half-assed French politician.'

Masson alleges that several months later he was contacted by an 'unknown businessman' who invited him on a free holiday to Morocco.

Grosdidier has not denied the recordings are real, but told France's 20 Minutes news website the conversation was a 'schoolboy prank'.

He added: 'A couple of years ago I was speaking with an accountant about my conflict with Masson and he came up with this absurb proposition.

'I went along with the conversation for a joke. It meant nothing. We were just larking around.'

Masson has filed a lawsuit against his rival for conspiracy, while Grosdidier has struck back with a suit for slander, manipulation and conspiracy.

Had the set-up had been successful, it
would have bore similarities to Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi, who had sex with a teenage prostitute.

Berlusconi, 74, has been at the centre of lurid sleaze allegations 
involving Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug.
