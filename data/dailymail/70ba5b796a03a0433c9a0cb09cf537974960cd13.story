The new Championship season is upon us with 24 teams looking to emulate Leicester, Burnley and QPR in winning promotion to the Premier League.

Coming down from the top flight are Cardiff, Fulham and Norwich while Wolves, Brentford and Rotherham will join them in the second tier after earning promotion form League One.

It has been a summer of upheaveal off the pitch for many sides in the Championship, with five new managers being appointed and two takeovers going through - assuming that is that Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov moves in at Sheffield Wednesday in the coming days as expected.

Trouble ahead? The inexperienced Dave Hockaday has taken over at Leeds United ahead of the new season

Turbulent: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has already sacked Brian McDermott while in charge 

At Leeds there is a new owner already in place in Italian Massimo Cellino and he has in turn appointed a new manager at Elland Road in the previously unknown Dave Hockaday.

Charlton and Nottingham Forest - themselves both recently taken over by Belgian and Kuwaiti owners - have brought in new managers in the shape of Bob Peeters and Stuart Pearce respectively.

Brighton too have a new man at the helm in the form of ex-Liverpool captain Sami Hyypia while Blackpool, in the headlines all summer for all the wrong reasons, have appointed Peeters’ predecessor at Charlton, Jose Riga.

How long Riga lasts at Blackpool in anyone’s guess with the club’s fans in civil war with their owners who have only provided the Belgian with 17 players to work with.

With all that out of the way we’re up to the present day and full fixture list this weekend.

Here’s a look at the promotion contenders and those who will be fighting the drop...

Bounce back? Felix Magath will be hoping for immediate promotion to the Premier League with Fulham

The favourites

Fulham look in the best shape of the relegated clubs despite a summer of upheaval, while Norwich should also be in the mix for automatic promotion.

Felix Magath’s methods have not been popular with all at Craven Cottage but he has managed to assemble a strong, new squad in a short period of time, spearheaded by £11million marquee signing Ross McCormack from Leeds.

The Cottagers also have an exciting batch of youngsters who have come through their academy and if Magath gets the blend right then the title is Fulham’s for the taking.

Norwich opted to appoint Neil Adams as their full-time manager in May despite him not being able to save them from the drop as caretaker, but they should benefit from the continuity of having a club man in charge.

The £3m capture of 22-goal Lewis Grabban from Bournemouth and the addition of ex-Rangers forward Kyle Lafferty look smart pieces of business but a lot depends on who leaves with nearly four weeks of the transfer window still left - and departures are expected.

Kenny Jackett’s exciting young Wolves squad make them real contenders for back-to-back promotions.

Jackett has real strength in depth to call upon in every position and will still do so even if he manages to move on several players still at Molineux on big contracts from the time of their back-to-back relegations.

Derby will be looking to go one better after Wembley heartache in the play-off final in May but have lost George Thorne, Andre Wisdom and Patrick Bamford from their squad last season either to injury - in Thorne’s case after he made his loan move from West Brom permanent - or due to the expiration of loans.

Steve McClaren’s squad is a young one too and they can only improve.

Wigan and Cardiff’s squads both lack balance but are full of talent nonetheless. If either Uwe Rosler or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can find the right formula then they could both challenge all of the above for the top two places.

Dark horses

Reading have been static in the transfer market as they await investment but still have the benefit of having one of the most prolific academies in the country fuelling their first-team.

If they can keep hold of the likes of Alex McCarthy, Jordan Obita and Hal Robson-Kanu then there’s no reason why they can’t finish in the top six, which they so nearly did last season.

Bournemouth flirted with the play-offs towards the end of last season after a brilliant run of form in the spring and if Callum Wilson - a big-money arrival from Coventry - can replace the goals of Grabban they could sneak in to the top six.

Falling out: Stuart Pearce was unhappy with Nottingham Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi for selling players

Despite his high profile the appointment of Stuart Pearce as manager is a massive gamble by Nottingham Forest given that he has not managed at club level for seven years.

He has a very strong squad to work with though, especially after the £5m signing of Britt Assombalonga from Peterborough, and if he can get them performing to their potential there is no reason why they can’t finish in the top six. If.

Elsewhere, Ipswich and Blackburn have steadily improved under Mick McCarthy and Gary Bowyer respectively over the last two seasons and will be in the play-off race, while if £2.8m Spanish striker Kike can adapt quickly to Championship football then Middlesbrough too will be in the mix.

Relegation battle

As mentioned before, Blackpool are in dire straits and unless there is rapid and significant investment they are doomed.

Even if Riga gets up to a full quota of players it will not be easy getting them all pulling in the same direction given the amount of dissent and uncertainty around Bloomfield Road.

Promoted duo Brentford and Rotherham look in good shape and will be confident of finishing above the likes of Birmingham, Charlton, Huddersfield and Millwall, who all look set for another relegation scrap.

Leeds, meanwhile, for the attention around their new owner, have gone backwards in terms of the quality of their playing squad.

It will be fascinating to see how Hockaday - who has only ever managed in non-league - gets on at a club the size of Leeds’ stature. The experiment could go horribly wrong.
