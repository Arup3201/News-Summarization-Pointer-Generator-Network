The master bedroom alone is one-and-a-half times the size of a typical new house.

But if you’re still worried about finding space to stretch out, relax – there are four more bedrooms to choose from, excluding the staff quarters.

As for the price of this rental property, if you have to ask, you definitely can’t afford it at £65,000 per month, or £780,000 a year.

But, while they are full of praise for its fine furnishings, there is one thing the lettings agents omit to mention.

Audley House has a serviceable two-limousine garage – but its next-door neighbour but one is a monstrous multi-storey car park.

Audley House is a six-storey home, spread over 8,346 sq/ft, and has four reception rooms, five VIP bedroom suites, a family kitchen, a gym and private walled gardens

The stunning six-storey home is ready for tenants to move in tomorrow - if they can stump up the cash

London's Audley House (left) comes fully furnished with a huge inventory list of luxurious furniture, fixtures and fittings (right) and is 'ready for tenants to move in tomorrow'. Worth around £35,000, the stunning home is available for a rental price of £15,000 per week - which equates to £65,000 per month

That's not in the ad: From the exterior shots in the advert, you'd never know that two doors down there is a concrete multi-storey car park

Peter Wetherell, managing director of
 Wetherell, said: 'Taking into perspective that a client could have 
assets of £500 million or £1 billion, spending £720,000 per annum to 
rent a mansion in Mayfair is literally pocket change.'

Tenants
 will have to pay £15,000 a week to rent the £35million London mansion, 
on top of £125,000 a year for bills including council tax, gas and 
electricity, water bills,TV licence and security.

A five year contract means handing the private landlord £3.9million. 

Just like with a run-of-the-mill rental, interested parties will have to fork out a six week deposit and the first month's rent if they want the home.

On this occasion it means paying the landlord £150,000, which is only slightly less than the £167,000 average price paid for a home in England and Wales.

The property, which can be rented immediately, has been kitted out with antique crystal chandeliers, grand fireplaces 
and bespoke furniture. It also has comfort cooling, restored period 
features and state-of-the-art security and audio/entertainment 
technology are incorporated throughout.

The tenant will have to pay a staggering £780,000 over 12 months for The Grade II listed Georgian home - enough to buy a pleasant family home in London

Mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell and his long term partner Claire Johnson who are behind the luxury Mayfair rental

The building is owned by billionaire entrepreneur John Caudwell, whose extravagant taste in homes came to light last October, when he proposed linking two Mayfair mansions by a 14,000 square ft underground extension.

For many, £250 million is a giant fortune, but for Caudwell, who made his fortune by building an immensely successful telecom company over 20 years, it's essentially tipping money.

Caudwell, born into a working-class family in Stoke-on-Trent, he started his empire in 1987 with his brother when he made an early bet on the world's booming industry of mobile phones.

He bought 26 phones from the U.S. and sold them to British plumbers and businessmen for thousands each.

In 1993 he founded the service provider Singlepoint, before selling the brand, which had gained 1.9 million contract customers, to Vodafone for $650 million.

He used the profits to build his empire further by piling money into his handset store, Phones4U.

He sold the majority stake in Phones4U in 2006 for $2.8 billion, and the remaining stake in 2011 for $272 million.

Caudwell claims he is Britain's biggest income tax payer and refuses to use offshore tax havens like Jersey or Monaco like many other British billionaire entrepreneurs.

The estate agent marketing the mansion on Wednesday described the rental as 'pocket change' to the sort of people interested

The bedrooms are all decorated in different coloured decor to keep the theme of the property throughout - and with plush leather and velvet, it is luxurious from floor to ceiling

The floorplan of Audley House includes four reception rooms, five VIP bedroom suites, family kitchen, gym and private walled gardens

The six-storey home also has a gym equipped with all the mod cons - in stark contrast to the luxury in the rest of the home
