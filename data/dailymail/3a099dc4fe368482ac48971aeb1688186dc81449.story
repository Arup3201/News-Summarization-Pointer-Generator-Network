Gordon Strachan insists he has no issue with the Tartan Army booing Irish duo Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy — as long as it is on purely footballing grounds.

Both players were born in Glasgow but opted to use family ties to represent the Republic of Ireland.

While playing in Scotland with Celtic and Hamilton, respectively, they suffered abuse at the hands of rival fans.

Now Everton team-mates in the English Premier League, however, Strachan has seen the duo attract huge transfer fees since and believes any abuse from the Scotland support in next week’s Euro 2016 qualifier at Parkhead will be a testament to their footballing abilities.

Asked if Scots fans should lay off the pair, Strachan — who named Rangers youngster Lewis Macleod in a 27-man squad yesterday — said: ‘No, they can do what they want.

‘Are you going to ask them to pay 60 quid and then tell them they can’t say something?

‘As long as you don’t have that nastiness about it, then that is fine. But we have all been booed. I used to come here (to Parkhead) regularly and get booed. It didn’t bother me. And that was when I was the manager.

‘It is part of football. It is like pantomime stuff. As long as it is pantomime humour, then we don’t mind that. If it goes beyond that, then that’s not fine.’

Addressing claims that previous abuse of McGeady and McCarthy might have betrayed a strain of anti-Irish sentiment in Scottish football, Strachan believes it might now happen for a different reason.

‘Do you know why they’ll get booed? It is because they are good players,’ he said.

‘If they were useless, they would not boo them.

‘As long as you keep it to the boos and leave it like that, so it is pantomime booing, that is what I like. That is good fun. They are getting booed because they are terrific players.’

McCarthy’s grandfather hailed from Donegal and was a strong influence on his career, while McGeady also qualified for Ireland via the grandparent rule and played for Ireland up to Under-17 level before the SFA fully appreciated his ability.

Sanguine on the decision both players made, Strachan insisted: ‘Listen, you play for whatever country you feel you are. If you feel Irish, then you play for Ireland and, if you feel you are Scottish, then you play for Scotland.

‘My boys are as Scottish as anyone but have lived most of their time in England.

‘Whatever you feel you are, wherever you feel you come from, where your family come from, you do that. I don’t have a problem with that.’

Gordon Strachan says he is happy for Scotland fans to boo the pair, but if it is in the right spirit

As Celtic manager, Strachan’s relationship with McGeady was occasionally strained.

The Everton player has admitted that abuse from Scottish fans irritated him in the past but the Scotland manager believes booing will have no impact on his former charge.

‘Absolutely not,’ he said. ‘It will not bother him. He is a terrific player, so it will not bother him, and it will not bother James McCarthy.

Despite widespread criticism of ticket prices, the SFA are close to a 60,000 sell-out for the encounter with the Republic — with travelling supporters allocated just over 3,000 briefs.

Strachan, meanwhile, said there was no question of Stuart McCall quitting the Scotland set-up, following his resignation as Motherwell manager.

‘No, we didn’t even think about that,’ he said. ‘I think he is fine. He is good.’

Stoke full-back Phil Bardsley has been recalled to the squad in the absence of the injured Alan Hutton.
