Cyclists can have one for the road thanks to an invention which allows them to keep a shot of booze in their handlebars.

The crafty idea was created by cyclist Yannick Read, 42, who wanted something to keep him warm on his daily 10-mile commute to work.

The black plug part of the Handlebar Minibar is 22mm and will fit most bikes - slotting into either handlebar. Its inventor also envisaged the flask being used to store bank notes.

Mr Read, 42, who lives in Kingston upon Thames and works at the Environmental Transport Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, said: 'The idea is just a bit of fun that was inspired by this freezing weather that we've been experiencing.

'I cycle 20 miles a day and it's pretty cold out there - it's nice to have the option of a quick drink to warm you up.

'A small sip of brandy can give you a warm feeling on a cold day. It's literally a sip of drink - so people won't be falling off their bikes.'

Mr Read stressed that what cyclists store in the flask is up to them, and added: 'Some people may want to put energy drink in the container but others may choose to use cherry brandy for example.

'You don't even have to use it to store drink. It's just the right size for a five pound note - and it will be completely hidden.

'When you're out on your bike, you often need some cash to buy a drink or a sandwich - so this is another option the minibar gives you.'

Mr Read revealed how he loves designing quirky items in his spare time. He said: 'This is my own project and I'm always coming up with inventions when I'm free - it's a hobbie of mine.'

The device is available online and costs Â£5.
