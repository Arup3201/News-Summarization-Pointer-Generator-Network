MPs have been banned from touching statues of ex-Prime Ministers including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.

The bronze monuments to Great British leaders have become damaged by today’s politicians touching their feet for good luck before giving speeches.

But art bosses in Parliament say four statues at the entrance to Commons are now ‘seriously under threat’ and are preparing to rope them off to stop MPs from paying the traditional tribute.

Tribute: The statue of Margaret Thatcher was unveiled by the Iron Lady and David Cameron in the Commons in 2007

The member’s lobby outside the main double doors to the Commons chamber contains four impressive statues of former Prime Ministers.

A bronze of Sir Winston Churchill looms large, and touching his foot has become a tradition for up and coming MPs hoping some of the war leader’s political stardust would rub off on them.

Tories have also taken to rubbing the statue of Margaret Thatcher, while Labour MPs pay tribute at the feet of ex-PM Clement Attlee and Lib Dems make a beeline for David Lloyd George.

But the tradition is causing such significant damage that experts have taken casts of the feet in case they need to be replaced.

The 7ft 6in bronze of Baroness Thatcher by sculptor Antony Dufort was unveiled by the Iron Lady and David Cameron in the Commons in 2007.

Since Lady Thatcher's death in April there have been calls for a prominent statue to be erected in a public place in central London.

Melanie Unwin, the Commons’ deputy art curator, said ‘Four statues  - Winston Churchill, Clement

Attlee, Margaret Thatcher and David Lloyd George - in the Members’ Lobby are seriously under threat due to the tradition of touching the toes of the statues for good luck.

‘There are now cracks and small holes on the surface of the Churchill statue, and substantial loss of surface texture on the other statues.’

The feet have been re-waxed and re-coloured regularly to protect them and help to monitor the level of touching.

Ms Unwin added: ‘Casts have been taken of the feet of the statues in case the damage gets to a point where they need to be recast.’

In a bid to curb the damage, new MPs are no longer told by officials about the tradition and parliament’s tour guides try to stop visitors from touching the statues.

But the Speaker’s Advisory Committee on artworks has now ordered the area to be roped off, to stop MPs getting close to their idols.

‘The seriousness of the problem, which was compromising the integrity of internationally important art works, left no choice but to install small barriers to prevent the feet of the statues being touched,’ Ms Unwin added.

When the Commons is sitting only MPs and some journalists are allowed in member's lobby, which was destroyed during the Blitz.
