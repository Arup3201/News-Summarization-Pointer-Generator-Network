Not an ID card: The Government was last night forced to deny it was bringing in ID cards by the back door after it revealed plans to offer everyone a virtual ID

The Government was last night forced to deny it was bringing in ID cards by the back door after it revealed plans to offer everyone a virtual ID.

People will be able to store personal data online, file tax returns and apply for driving licences through a single website as part of the voluntary scheme.

More than half a million people are expected to sign up to use the ‘Verify’ project within a year.

Under the programme, users will choose one of five private providers – including Experian and the Post Office – to complete an online security check.

This will give them a username and password, as well as a code sent to their mobile phone, which will give them access to government services.

Driving licences and some self-assessment tax returns will be among the first services to be offered as part of the scheme next month, with tax credits and benefits records expected to follow in March.

But last night there were concerns about the scheme because of the history of hugely costly government IT projects and data blunders.

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, which has been involved in the scheme’s development, said the ‘government must tread carefully’ given past issues over losing records.

She told The Times: ‘It has to ensure that this is a scheme that the public can have full confidence in.

‘They must make themselves very clear about how it will work, including details of what safeguards are in place to ensure that the private companies being used to verify a users’ identity won’t wrongly gain access to any information.’

Government aides insisted that rather than bringing in ID cards by a different method the scheme would make any attempt to reintroduce a compulsory document less likely.

‘This removes once and for all the need for an identity card because it will be possible to prove your identity securely without one,’ a source told The Times.

Labour introduced the controversial idea of ID cards in 2002, but they did not become a reality until November 2009 after years of disagreements.

The Coalition government scrapped the entire project less than a year later, saying it wanted to reverse what it saw as ‘an erosion of civil liberties’ under Labour.
