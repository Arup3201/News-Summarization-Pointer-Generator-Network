All Jorie Rogers asked was to live long enough to see her son's first birthday in March.

The terminally ill mom got her wish and then fought on for another six weeks before tragically losing her battle with cancer, and saying goodbye to her 'miracle' baby, on Mother's Day.

Rogers, 32, was told her radiation treatment would leave her unable to have a child, but she managed to conceive anyway, and in 2012 gave birth to little Tristan.

'She fiercely loved her son Tristan like
a lioness,' her friend, Tisa Perra, said on Sunday in a heart-breaking tribute on Facebook.

'Her fighting spirit was an inspiration to many. She lived 
her life fully despite disease and suffering. May she rest in peace. May
she be free from suffering.'

Perra, the leader of a Facebook cancer 
support group of which Rogers was a member, also described the mother as
a 'valiant and courageous Pheo Trooper.'

'Jorie Wilson Rogers, was a loving mom, wife, sister, daughter and friend,' she wrote on Sunday.

Rogers and her husband George Rogers celebrated Tristan's first birthday in late March with a carnival-themed party complete with a bounce house, balloons and a big cake. They wanted to make it memorable because they knew it would be his first and last with his mother.

Rogers clung to life for another six weeks but on Wednesday, she posted a message on Facebook asking friends and family to come say their goodbyes.

Rare disease: The mom from Ladue, Montana, suffered paraganglioma, a rare form of cancer that caused dozens of tumors in her body

'They've given me one to two weeks 
left,' she wrote. 'I guess if anyone wants to drop by for a visit 
sometime now would be the time to do it. I also realize that death is 
just too scared (sic) for some people to face in person and and if 
that's you, that's ok too.'

The mom from Ladue, Montana, suffered 
paraganglioma, a rare form of cancer that caused dozens of tumors in her
body. In March, she stopped receiving treatment after doctors told her 
there was nothing more they could do.

In the weeks before her death, Rogers' condition had deteriorated significantly along with her spirit.

On May 6 she wrote on Facebook: 'Do you know how hard it is to write when your hands don't work anymore? How about eating, typing, brushing your teeth, wiping your butt, tying your shoelaces, getting dressed? Yeah, it is all nearly impossible. Its all humiliating. And it all sucks. I used to pray I would make it to my next birthday, now I don't.'

Ashley Swip, the president and founder of 3 Little Birds 4 Life, which organized Tristan's spectacular birthday party, said George Rogers broke the sad news to her on Sunday morning.

'Jorie was really special, and today's been really bittersweet,' Swip told the New York Daily News. 'I'm so glad we were able to meet her and her family. And we will continue to help the family in any way possible.'

Rogers was told she would not live to see Tristan, who has Down syndrome, turn two, so she wanted to make his first birthday special.

Knee deep in medical bills, it seemed unlikely that the Rogers would be able to go ahead with the party for Tristan.

But the mom's wish was granted when Illinois charity 3 Little Birds 4 Life stepped in and threw Tristan a carnival to celebrate his first year.

The party included clowns, balloons, a
bouncy castle and a colorful birthday cake.

Rogers said: 'It's so 
much more than I could have hoped for. It's amazing.'

She
told KSDK: 'It's very special because not only are we celebrating my 
son's first year and everything that he had to go through to get here, 
but it's the one birthday that I'll get with him. And we get to 
celebrate the one year that we had together.'

Amid preparations for the party, Rogers decided to stop all treatments and come home to live her remaining days.

She said: 'My cancer has unfortunately 
progressed to a point where there's really nothing else that we can do. 
We've pretty much run the gamut and tried everything.

'So we're just going to live out the rest of the days as best we can and be as happy as we can with the time we have left.'

Although Tristan will be too young to 
remember the party, Rogers wanted him to have photos and videos of 
the day as keepsakes after she passed away.

She added in March: 'I want him to be able to look back on videos and pictures from today and hear the stories about today, and for him to know how much his mom loved him. And for him to know how hard his mom fought to be here for him.â€™

The charity which organized the party, 3 Little Birds 4 Life, has also fixed a young man's 'chemo teeth' and helped a person with brain cancer go to Disney World.
