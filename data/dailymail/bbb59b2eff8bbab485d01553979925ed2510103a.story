Bradford City have branded their FA Cup television snub 'absolutely ridiculous' after missing out on a £250,000 payday.

The League One side pulled off one of the biggest upsets in the competition's history when they came from two goals down to win 4-2 at Premier League leaders Chelsea in the fourth round.

They were rewarded with a home tie against the winners of Sunderland and Fulham's replay but TV chiefs at the BBC and BT Sport have chosen not to screen their fifth-round game.

Arsenal vs Middlesbrough

Preston or Sheffield United vs Cambridge or Manchester United 

The club’s official Twitter feed simply posted ‘#nomagic’, while Bradford joint-chairman Mark Lawn said: ‘BBC and BT Sport have let themselves down with this. They’ve really shot themselves in the foot. We’ve scored the most goals of any club in the FA Cup this season, we’ve just pulled off the biggest shock in history and they don’t come and get us. It’s absolutely ridiculous.

‘I’ve had calls from everywhere since we beat Chelsea. I was talking to Radio Ulster in Northern Ireland and to Radio Cumbria — everyone wants to know about what we’ve achieved.

‘The whole world is looking at us at the moment and the TV broadcasters don’t put us on. You’ve got to wonder if the people who decide these things actually know about football.’

Instead, the West Bromwich v West Ham tie, Crystal Palace v Liverpool or Bolton, Aston Villa v Leicester, Arsenal v Middlesbrough and Preston or Sheffield United v Cambridge or Manchester United will be shown live from February 14-16.

Lawn added: ‘Who picks these games? West Brom v West Ham, is that really what the FA Cup is all about? They all promote the FA Cup’s magic and romance, but where’s the magic gone now? How can they justify it? It’s a disgrace.’

He said the club felt further aggrieved over losing the windfall they would have received through television revenue. ‘That goes to the Premier League clubs, because they really need the money, don’t they?’ he added, sarcastically.

The BBC said they had considered the draw carefully before choosing the fixtures to show live and hope to present Football Focus from Valley Parade.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘TV match selections have to be decided before the outcome of replays and for that reason we have selected what we believe to be the best fixtures, given all the potential scenarios.’

A BT Sport spokesman said: ‘We aim to cover the teams and stories that appeal to as wide a number of fans as possible, while staying true to the traditions of the competition.

‘Fixture selection is a complex process involving multiple parties including broadcasters, clubs, the FA and local authorities.’
