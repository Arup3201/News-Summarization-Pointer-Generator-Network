Against my will, I've become a bargain basement shopper.

Whereas I once frequented the hallowed halls of Harrods, now it's Poundland and Primark. Just the lighting alone is jarring, to say the least.

What's interesting though, is that I frequently catch the eye of one of my well turned out peers who I'm certain is making the same adjustment as me.

Ashley Pearson says it is possible to live a champagne lifestyle on a tighter budget

In our case it's a new baby that has made the difference, but for some it may be saving to get on the property ladder, expensive IVF treatments, school fees or buying a new home. Whatever it is, it's nice to know that I'm not alone. 

Having said that, although my formerly Champagne lifestyle is rapidly downshifting into a Prosecco world - my tastes haven't changed at all.

And whilst I find myself hurtling towards middle age in a home cluttered with Fisher Price, I can tell you that I am not ready to swap my DVF for Boden and my Choos for Clarks. 

At least not yet.

Therefore, after careful investigation, I've put together a guide to the best luxe-loving and glam values out there. And if, like me, your budget no longer matches your carefully cultivated taste levels, this one's for you.

Let's talk linens.

I'm a total bed linen snob and I can talk thread count with the best of them. The first time my 4 month old vomited on my 1200 count white Turkish cotton I felt a physical pain.

Thankfully I've now discovered a website called Best Bed Linen.

They've supplied top five-star hotels for over 20 years; including The Savoy, The Goring, and Claridges. 

Best Bed Linen supply bedding for luxury hotels such as The Savoy but there sets are available from £115

This is a  5-star sleep experience in your own home. A set, which includes a flat or fitted sheet, duvet cover and 2-4 pillowcases starts at £115. www.thebestbedlinenintheworld.com

For those of us who like to cook, or in my case have fancy pots and pans I don't use, on display - we all know how expensive Le Crueset is. Gorgeous, lasts forever and a true status symbol on the stove.

Check out Sainsbury's new range that comes in a kicky aqua and fantastic lapis blue. A great alternative, cooks like a dream and looks v snazzy. 

Ashley loves the Le Crueset style pots available at Sainsburys

And what about the all important beauty upkeep? Celebrites such as Kim Kardashian have personal Spray Tanners who come to their home and give them a customised spray tan. No more streaking, no brown palms or stains in between fingers.

And in London at least you can get a similar service on a budget. Beau Bronz, which sprays for TV shows like This Morning and Dancing on Ice offers a bespoke spray tan for £40. And even better, they come to you! This service is available across London (Call Abi 07968133221 or Rachel 07872945044)

I know Tesco does well for clothes but I had no idea they made such stylish home accessories.

Recently bemoaning the costs of setting up a home office, I was delighted to discover a great range of options. This stylish lamp for £25 was a steal. 

Ashley was pleasantly surprised by the range of stylish homewears available at Tesco

Are you amongst those of us who can immediately identify Jo Malone's Lime Basil Mandarin cologne (£78)? Bronnley has made a very clever substitute. It's called Lime and Bergamot and every time I wear it, I get asked if it's the Jo Malone signature scent. I am in love with it as much as I am the fact that it costs a mere £14.

Ashley says that Bronnley's Lime & Bergamot scent could easily be mistaken for Jo Malone

Although I am not by any means an 
attachment parent, a new baby invariably made us long for a bigger bed. 
Early morning play and sleep sessions, and just general exhaustion left 
us fighting for our corners.

I got a tip off from a producer friend who works on a home design show. Apparently this site is a  major decorator's secret with designer furnishings that look more expensive than they are. www.loveyourhomeforless.com.

We ordered the Isabella Storage Bed, and I can honestly say that in addition to saving more than 1000 pounds from others I had found, it's the prettiest bed I've ever seen. 

Ashley saved more than £1000 on her bed from Love Your Home for Less

I admit it, I am a total and complete candle snob. I can smell a Diptyque from a mile away, but at something like £40, their role in my household expenditures is now taken over by Pampers and Aptamil. 

I have found some lovely, less expensive alternatives. Check out Illume's Anemone, lovely looking and at £22, good value (beautybay.com). 

Also the dotcomgiftshop has some beautifully elegant candles for just £9.95 - I loved the Moroccon Rose and Fig. 

Ashley is a self confessed candle snob but is very keen on the dotcomgiftshop's offerings at £9.95

I'll never forget when a very famous British TV presenter confessed to me that her massive diamond wedding rings set was from Carat.

'Everyone expects me to have enormous and expensive rings, but I'd never spend that kind of money on jewellery.' 

Her sparkling 'diamonds' were so pretty and I'd always envied them, I couldn't believe they weren't the real thing. 

So, if your budget doesn't allow for the ring from Tiffany's you covet, check out Carat. Some of their pieces are truly lovely - and would fool all but the most practiced eye. www.carat.co

Carat is great for those of you without a Tiffany budget

My feet changed dramatically whilst pregnant, so post baby I was faced with a priceless wardrobe of shoes that no longer fit. 

You can thus imagine my utter delight upon discovering Moda in Pelle which does a mean Louboutin inspired white heel and a kicky pair that look like 'Tod's'.

However, it was this pair that really got me excited. They are very similar to the expensive wedges that Jennifer Aniston LIVES IN and retail for £50 instead of Jen's £230 version.

Despite being grounded at home more these days, I still love a little night away.

The free to download app HotelTonight allows you to book a room in 250 destinations at a huge discount.

Ashley loves Moda in Pelle's wedges that steal Jennifer Anniston's style for £50

The only catch is, you can't choose the hotel until the day of - but they have gorgeous properties in most major cities, and you are virtually guaranteed a lovely selection. We tried the swanky Beaufort hotel in Knightsbridge at a 50% savings and loved it. 

And another cash saving trick is to look out for new hotel launches.

CEO of 
luxury travel specialists Fox PR www.foxpr.co.uk  Lysbeth Fox says, 
'Hotels traditionally offer great value when they first open. Keep on 
top of local news in the location you're interested in, watch for hotel 
openings and book early.

Travel specialist Lysbeth Fox recommends the D-Resort Gocek in Dalaman, Turkey, for a spring break

Ashley stayed in the Kalamar Dream Villa on a recent trip to Turkey and said it was great value for money

'You
 can often secure an incredible deal if you're amongst the first wave of
 guests.' Her pick this season? D-Resort Gocek in Dalaman, Turkey which
 opens in May. Early bookings are now only £150 per night for the 
5-star, ultra glam, beach-fronted hotel, dresortgocek.com.tr.

Ashley says that although she is spending more and more time in Primark, she is a Harrods girl at heart

And for planning a trip for the whole family, if you want luxury without a massive hotel bill, consider Holiday Lettings (holidaylettings.co.uk).

We stayed at the Villa Kalamar Dream (Home ID 76799) on a recent trip to Turkey and were completely blown away. 

And at 222 pounds a night, a cost shared by 6 adults, it was incredible value. 

Breath-taking sea views, roof deck terraces with sun loungers,  fresh bread delivered each morning, maid service and chefs available, as well as an infinity pool and flat screened entertainment system to die for; it was truly A-list living. 

It was ideal for a family and far less pricey than a hotel.

For general pampering, look for ways to multi-task your treatments. Edward James' Aveda salons offer 15 minute 'Glow Facials' for clients who want to use their down-time in the salon (when colour is processing) or whilst their hair is being shampooed and conditioned. 

At £20 each the mini-facials are combined with a hand and arm massage and a lie down on a reclining massage bed.  If the treatments are booked with a colour service they are just £15. 

The bottom line: you may be more likely to spot me at Poundland than Prada these days, but I still like the finer things in life. 

And until things change, you'll find me dreaming of the day when TK Maxx stocks Crème de la Mer and Victoria Beckham designs.
