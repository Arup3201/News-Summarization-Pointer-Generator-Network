Pictures of the new-born baby of two Colorado movie theater shooting survivors have been released - as it emerged that medical bills of $2 million for his still critically injured father could financially ruin his family.

Mother Katie Medley, 21, gave birth to Hugo Jackson Medley in the same hospital where her husband Caleb is in a medically-induced coma after being shot in the head during Friday's massacre.

A hospital spokesman said Hugo was born at 7:11am and was 'doing great' along with his mother.

Katie's husband Caleb Medley, 23, who was shot after gunman James Holmes alleged sprayed a movie audience with bullets in Aurora but without health insurance the family face crippling medical bills if he fully recovers.

Miracle: Hugo Jackson Medley was born this morning at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora after his mother Katie, 21, survived the movie theater shooting on Friday night

He has lost his right eye and may have suffered permanent brain damage. Katie was not hurt.

The couple attended the midnight 
screening of the much-anticipated movie on what was supposed to be their
 last night out before their baby boy was born.

They even dressed up in Batman characters to celebrate.

Caleb's brother Seth, 21, told ABC he is showing small signs of improvement.

'There
 are indications that he understands us and can tell who we are,' he 
said. 'His wife talks to him and he shudders. There are obvious signs he
 understands.'

He says the doctors call his small successes -- a thumbs up on command and a clenched fist -- 'purposeful movement'.

Hope: Katie cradles Hugo as doctors told her that husband Caleb was showing signs of improvement

Katie Medley, who is quoted on a 
fundraising website set up by friends, said someone entered through an emergency exit at the bottom of the theater and threw something over their heads.

'I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene,' she said. But then he opened fire and her husband was shot.

'I didn't know how he was, because 
there was so much blood, but he was still moving, and he kept running 
his fingers through his hair,' she recounted.

She said her husband was the fourth 
victim removed from the theater after police arrived. They put him in the back of a police car and drove him to hospital.

Happier times: Caleb and Katie went to the Dark Knight Rises as one final date before the birth of their son

Fears: Caleb had won a stand up comedy contest days before he was shot in the face in the massacre

She added: 'I did not get to see him 
again because the police were keeping me, and I did not find out if he 
was still alive until they released me at about 4am.'

The couple's friend, Michael West has set up a website dedicated to raising funds for Caleb to help out the family with the spiraling medical costs.

The website has already raised over $186,000 and has a target of $500,000.

'Caleb doesn't have any insurance, so I put together a website,' said an emotional West.

'We talk to him because we know he can hear us and we tell him that he needs to get better because he needs to be a dad.'

On Monday, as Caleb lay in critical 
condition at University of Colorado Hospital, Katie was delivering their
 son. She had changed the delivery location so she could be close to 
him.

Katie Medley's father, David Sanchez, 
said his daughter and son-in-law had been waiting for a year to watch 
the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises.

While his daughter was delivering
 her baby, Sanchez went to the courthouse in suburban Denver where 
shooting suspect James Holmes was making his first court appearance.

Through this website set up by his friend Michael West, $186,000 has been raised towards paying for Caleb Medley's medical bills

Together: The couple were childhood sweethearts. Katie moved to Caleb's hospital to be close while giving birth

Support: Friends and family have set up a website to raise funds for the couple, pictured with a friend, who do not have health insurance. Their medical bills could reach millions

Sanchez, who works at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, arrived too late to get a seat and to see Holmes.

'When it's your own daughter and she escaped death by mere seconds, I want to say it makes you angry,' he said outside court.

'I wanted to come here. I wasn't sure 
about (Katie's) feelings. She is being very strong right now, having to 
make a huge amount of decisions.

'I have to go with what she wants. She 
really didn't want to give a whole bunch of information to the media. 
She has been avoiding it.'

Anger: Katie Medley's father, David Sanchez, appeared outside court on Monday and said his daughter and son-in-law 
had been waiting for a year to watch the premiere of The Dark Knight 
Rises

'Killer': Sanchez went to see gunman James Holmes in his first court appearance on Monday

Sanchez told the Denver Post that doctors aren't sure if Caleb Medley will be able to see his baby right away because of concerns about infections.

The aspiring stand-up 
comic had won a contest at a comedy club last week and he was expected 
to move on to the next round.

Friends have set up a website to raise money and support for the couple, who don't have health insurance. They have raised about $15,000, but medicals bill could reportedly reach $2 million.
