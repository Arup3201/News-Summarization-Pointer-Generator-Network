Sunderland want to sign Chelsea’s new £12million centre-half Kurt Zouma on loan for the season.

Jose Mourinho signed France U21 defender Zouma in January but the teenager stayed at St Etienne until the end of the season.

Loan star: Zouma signed for Chelsea in January but was immediately loaned back to Saint Etienne

New signing: Zouma cost Chelsea £12m but is not thought to be ready for first the team at Stamford Bridge

Chelsea have already allowed Czech centre-half Tomas Kalas to join Cologne on loan but Sunderland hope they can complete a swoop for Zouma because of sporting director Lee Congerton’s contacts at Stamford Bridge.

Congerton worked as a youth coach and a scout at Chelsea before moving with Frank Arnesen to Hamburg and then on to Wearside in March.

Wanted men: Baker (right) and Christensen have both impressed for Chelsea's Under-21 side

John Terry has signed a one-year contract extension but Mourinho would prefer to add another experienced centre-half to his ranks after selling David Luiz to Paris St Germain.

Sunderland also want Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen, 18, and midfielder Lewis Baker, 19.
