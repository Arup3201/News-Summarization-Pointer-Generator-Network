The German government does not want to allow Edward Snowden into the country as it fears this may damage relations with the United States

Germany's highest court has thrown out a bid by opposition parties to force the government to allow Edward Snowden to come to Berlin to testify about the National Security Agency's activities.

Members of the opposition Greens and Left Party want a parliamentary panel investigating the NSA's operations to hear from the whistleblower in person.

But the government does not want to allow Snowden into the country, as it fears this could damage to relations with the US and put it under pressure to extradite him.

The Federal Constitutional Court said on Friday that it has rejected as legally inadmissible a suit by the two opposition parties against the government's stance.

Government parties on the panel suggested questioning Snowden in Moscow, where he is currently living in exile. But the former NSA contractor has said through a lawyer he will only speak to the panel if allowed to do so Germany.

Snowden is currently wanted in the US after leaking classified details of government surveillance programmes.

Support for Snowden peaked in Germany last year when reports based on documents leaked by the whistleblower suggested that the NSA had targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.

Germany's chief federal prosecutor  in June opened an investigation into the alleged monitoring of a cellphone Merkel used for party business.

But this week Harald Range said  his office so far has found no actionable evidence that the calls were tapped.

'As of today, there is no evidence leading to charges that connection data were recorded or a phone call by the chancellor was listened to,' he said.

German magazine Der Spiegel broke the story of the alleged monitoring last year, citing documents provided by Snowden.

Edward Snowden, who is in Moscow, is seen on a giant screen during a live video conference for an interview as part of Amnesty International's annual Write for Rights campaign at the Gaite Lyrique in Paris this week

Range said his office does not have an original NSA document ordering the surveillance, and that Der Spiegel invoked its right to refuse testimony in response to a request to provide the original or answer questions about it.

The NSA has declined to comment, Snowden has not responded to an offer to give a written statement, and requests for information to various German security authorities 'haven't taken us further', Range said.

However, he said the investigation continues and will take account of what a separate parliamentary inquiry finds out.
