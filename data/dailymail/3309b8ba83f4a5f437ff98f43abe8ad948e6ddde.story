Louis van Gaal has confirmed Manchester United youngsters Paddy McNair and Tom Thorpe will be in the squad for Saturday's match against West Ham at Old Trafford. 

The two Under 21 defenders have been drafted in to deal with a lengthy injury list which includes centre backs Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. Tyler Blackett, who has been deputising in that position, is suspended after being sent off against Leicester last week. 

'They [McNair and Thorpe] are in the squad,' Van Gaal told MUTV on Friday. 'That is why we have a youth education. It was also our policy [to use the youth teams] and always the policy of the club too.'

With United's three first-choice centre backs out, the Dutchman is expected to drop Argentina international Marcos Rojo into the centre, with either Thorpe, the club's reserve team captain, or 19-year-old McNair, partnering him in the heart of United's backline.  

When asked if Daley Blind and Rojo were an option as a centre-back pairing, he said: 'No, I don't like having too many left-sided defenders or left-footed players in defence.

'I think always of balance so [instead] I have to pick up a right-sided central defender from the youth education. Normally, I am always doing things like that. I have already said that we have a lot of vacancies when you buy only six players and let 14 players go.'

'The amount of injuries is worrying me and they are not coming back,' the former Bayern Munich boss continued. 'Smalling is already, for the third time, injured. Evans also. Jones had one injury in the national team, which was unfortunate. 

'I am a coach with a lot of experience and I believe I have never been in this situation. It is surprising me and I am evaluating myself and my staff and also the players to see what is wrong but I cannot imagine what we are doing at another level than in my former clubs.'

Van Gaal said Saturday's game against West Ham could also see a league debut for Luke Shaw, who joined the club from Southampton in the summer but has been kept out by injury.  

'Maybe last week he could have played but it is better to give an injured player more time to recover and that's why he didn't play last week. He is now ready to play and I am anxious to see him.'

When asked if the 5-3 defeat to Leicester was a one-off, Van Gaal said: 'Yes, of course. I've spoken with the media and they are thinking it is a record occurrence. It is an incident. 

'For a player I hope it is a once in a lifetime incident. Me, as a coach, I have experienced such a result in Barcelona. We have to learn from it and improve.'

The Dutchman said he has been impressed by Angel Di Maria's versatility since his summer move from Spanish giants Real Madrid. 

'In both positions he is playing fantastic,' said Van Gaal. 'He is creating a lot, he is scoring goals and he gives assists. So, as a coach, you cannot want more. But we have also the main moment in football when we lose the ball and then he can improve.' 

On Falcao's fitness as he recovers from a serious knee injury, he said: 'We are building up Falcao in the same way we are building up the other players. You will notice I left Van Persie to train for the first three weeks before he came in for 60 minutes. I did the same with Falcao. He has impressed me and played very well. I hope he can continue.'

The 63-year-old said he believes West Ham are the toughest opponents United will have faced this season.  

'I think maybe this is the best team we have to beat until now,' he said. 'I was very impressed [with their win over Liverpool]. They play the same system we do. It is more or less one system against the same system. They play like a team. We have to learn and improve on the game against Leicester. I hope we will give our best and the defence can enjoy a victory again. 

'I hope that we play better as a team, especially when we lose the ball.  We have to do better than against Leicester City.'
