After handing her teacher a 'sick note' to skip the day's PE lesson - Olivia McEvoy thought she had pulled off the perfect crime.

But unbeknown to the 11-year-old, her mother Samantha had made no mention of her phony 'bad leg' as instructed, instead diagnosing her daughter with 'bone-idle-itus' and suggesting she be given 'a few extra laps'.   

The 27-year-old mother-of-two, of Cheshire, said Olivia was 'perfectly fit' to take part in the class and asked the teacher Mr Whittle to show her daughter the letter after reading it.

Stitched up: The note (above) Olivia McEvoy's mother Samanatha wrote for her after she said she was 'too cold' to go to her PE lesson

Surprise: Ms McEvoy said her daughter Olivia had a 'severe case of bone-idle-itus' and suggested she did a few extra laps to warm her up

She posted a picture of the note on Facebook, which has since gone viral with more than 3,000 shares.

It was accompanied with the comment: 'Well here you go Olivia here's your note for PE, it will be sealed & in an envelope ready for her to hand to the head in the morning.' 

The Year six pupil unwittingly limped into class at St John's C of E Primary school in Sandbach, Cheshire, citing that she had a bad leg and even giggled to friends that she had got out of PE. 

The joke was revealed when the headmaster - who was in on the plan - read the letter and called Olivia into his study where he told her: 'There are things in life we don't enjoy but have to do them.'

Olivia then discovered her PE kit had already been dropped off at reception after her scaffolder father Wayne, 34, had secretly given it to a classmate's mother who was taking them to school that day. 

Ms McEvoy said: 'Unfortunately she didn't have to do the extra laps but she actually really enjoyed PE and had a good lesson. But she wasn't speaking to me at all - not for the rest of the night.

'When she got picked up by Wayne she had a face like thunder. She didn't speak to him. It was parents evening that night and all the teachers thought it was hilarious.  

'It was like an episode of Absolutely Fabulous, I call her Saffy because she is so clever and sensible. When she came home she said, "mum I do not know why you think it's so funny" which made it all the more amusing.

'We couldn't stop giggling when we wrote the letter. We had to search the house top to bottom for an envelope to keep the plan secret.' 

Ms McEvoy, who also has a three-year-old son called Kaylan, said she and her husband played the prank after Olivia came downstairs no fewer than a dozen times to nag her about writing the fake letter.  

Harsh lesson: Olivia's mother said: 'There's no chance she'll be doing it again in a hurry. It's a lesson to her that she can't get out of things she doesn't like'

She said: 'She has tried every trick in the book to get out of PE. In the run up to this she has left her kit at home, only taken one shoe to lessons, has a tummy ache, her foot hurts - the teachers know her very well.'  

'She doesn't like to move at all. She'd rather sit on her i-Pad or games console. It was about 10.30 pm and she was up and down the stairs, saying "please write me a note, I'll do anything, I'll make you a brew, I'll clean, I'll look after Kaylan".

'I kept saying, 'you are not having a note' and sent her back to bed. In the end when she came down again I shouted, "get me a pen and paper then".

She added: "I said 'so what's wrong with you?" and she told me to write she that had a bad leg. She just didn't want to move and said it was too cold.'

She said that upon agreeing to say that she had a sore leg, Olivia's face lit up before she tottered off to bed none the wiser.

Played th part: Olivia, pictured with her little brother Kaylan, even walked into class with a limp so that teachers would believe her made-up injury

The mother added: 'She thought she was a winner. Wayne and I were literally sat there wetting ourselves writing this letter. 

'Then I realised we'd need an envelope so she couldn't read it. It was 11pm and we were running around the house looking for an envelope. It was like we were the kids.' 

Ms McEvoy then took to Facebook to disclose to a few of her friends what she had done, posting a picture of the note before it went viral.

She added: 'Everyone was saying I was terrible and couldn't believe I was going to send her with it. I can't believe how many people have shared it but I thought it was absolutely hilarious.' 

'There's no chance she'll be doing it again in a hurry. It's a lesson to her that she can't get out of things she doesn't like.'
