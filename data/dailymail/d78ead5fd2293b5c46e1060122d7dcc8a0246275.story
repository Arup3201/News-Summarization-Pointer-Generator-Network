The children of the Arizona weapons instructor who was accidentally shot dead last month by a 9-year-old girl whom he was teaching how to fire an Uzi released an emotional video to let their father's killer know they bear her no ill will.

Charles Vacca, 39, a father of four from Lake Havasu City, was shot and killed August 25 at the Last Stop gun range in White Hills when his 9-year-old student lost control of a sub-machine gun.

On Friday, personal injury attorney Marc Lamber representing the Vacca family uploaded onto his law firm's website a video showing the instructor's children reading aloud a letter they had penned to the 9-year-old girl.

Full of grace: The four children of Charles Vacca released a video statement through their family lawyer telling the 9-year-old who accidentally shot dead their father that they pray for her

‘We don't know your name, but we're connected by this tragedy,’ the children wrote.

Taking turns to read the statement, Christopher Vacca, 11; Tylor Vacca, 14; Elizabeth Vacca, 15, and Ashley Moser, 19, extended an olive branch to the child who ended their father’s life so tragically. 

'You're only 9 years old, ' the Vacca children said into the camera. 'We think about you. We are worried about you. We pray for you, and we wish you peace.

'Our dad would want the same thing.'

Charles Vacca’s family also used the video statement to tell the world about their father.

‘Our dad wasn't just an instructor: he was funny, strong, a protector, a hero and our friend. He was a good man.

‘Like you, we are living though this tragic event that we cannot shut off. It's with us all the time,’ the letter read.

Speaking on behalf of the slain weapons instructor, his daughter Elizabeth said that their father would have wanted the 9-year-old to move on with her life.

‘You should not let that define you. You should love yourself and love your family,’ the 15-year-old read.

Role model: Vacca's children described the 39-year-old father of four as a protector, a hero, a good man and their friend

Christopher Vacca concluded the statement with the words: ‘some day we hope we can meet you, hug you and tell you that it's OK.’

The Vaccas' video comes a week after Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan, the 9-year-old's parents, released a statement describing how they prayed 'day and night' that the instructor would survive after the shooting, and how devastated they were when he succumbed to his injury.

The family visited the gun range August 25 while vacationing in Las Vegas 60 miles away.

The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Mr Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot an Uzi gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, according to police reports. 

He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Mr Vacca with a single shot to the head, the reports stated.

The girl then dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl then ran towards her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder.

Mature beyond their years: Elizabeth Vacca, 15, and Christopher Vacca, 11, urged the 9-year-old to move on with her life and expressed hope to meet her one day and give her a hug 

Group effort: Ashley Moser, 19, and Tyler Vacca, 14, took turns with their other siblings reading aloud the emotional letter they had written together  

Her family were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured and didn't immediately realize that Mr Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues rushed over to him, the reports state.

The incident unfolded as the girl's mother recorded her daughter firing weapons on her mobile phone.

In the video, released by investigators, Mr Vacca can be heard saying 'All right, go ahead and give me one shot.'

He then cheers when she fires one round at the target and then says, 'All right, full auto.'

No criminal charges have been filed in the deadly shooting against the child or her family.
