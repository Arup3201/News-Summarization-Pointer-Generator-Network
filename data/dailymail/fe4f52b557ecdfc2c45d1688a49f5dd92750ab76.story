Paul Collingwood will be plotting England's downfall at next year's World Cup after agreeing a return to Scotland's coaching staff.

The Durham captain, who is England's most capped one-day player and World Twenty20 winning captain, had previously worked with Scotland as joint interim head coach when they booked their place at the tournament at the start of the year.

He was subsequently drafted in by England's then limited-overs coach Ashley Giles to work with the Three Lions at the World T20 in Bangladesh but his role was discontinued when Peter Moores returned as head coach.

Had Giles got the nod, it is likely that Collingwood, 38, would have gone to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in the England camp.

But instead he will be trying to help the Saltires pull off a huge upset when the sides meet in Christchurch on February 23.

Collingwood said: 'It's a great pleasure for me to be back on the coaching team with the Scotland squad for the 2015 World Cup.

'I'm very much looking forward to working with them to help get the team fully prepared for these incredibly important matches.'

Scotland's head coach Grant Bradburn added: 'We are fortunate to once again have the valuable services of Paul Collingwood on board with us for the World Cup.

'Paul will bring a calmness and confidence to our environment and is very familiar with all of our players having been a support coach with Scotland during the World Cup qualifiers in February.

'Having the experience of Paul in our corner will be a huge asset for all of us during this event.'

Scotland also face Australia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand and Afghanistan at the competition.
