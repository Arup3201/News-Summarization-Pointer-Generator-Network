Missing 16-year-old Cailey-Anne Payne, who has not been in contact with anyone for a week after vanishing from her home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire

Fears are growing for a 16-year-old girl who has been missing for more than a week.

Cailey-Anne Payne has not made contact with family or friends since Saturday morning, prompting police to ramp up the public appeal to find her.

Police said the teenager, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has not used a bank card or updated her social media accounts since she went missing on March 26.

Cailey-Anne's best friend has told police she was with her on Saturday morning, when she caught a train to London.

Police have since released CCTV pictures of Cailey-Anne at Milton Keynes train station.

Thames Valley Police have stressed that the inquiry is still a live missing persons investigation.

Detective Superintendent Barry Halliday told a specially-convened Press briefing: 'There is always a concern while we have not been able to make contact with Cailey-Anne, that because of her vulnerability, she has come to harm.'

He revealed the 'typical teenager' may have been in Acton, West London, at the weekend and that her picture was being plastered on electronic billboards across the capital.

She is known to have friends in the Acton, Hackney and Ealing areas.

'This is a 16-year-old girl who is alone. She has not got any access to money and the reality of it is she has now been missing for seven days,' said the senior detective.

'We are treating this as a live missing persons investigation. We are trying to do all we can to capture any sightings or community intelligence that lets us know Cailey-Anne is safe,' added Det. Supt. Halliday, the Milton Keynes Police commander.

'This appeal also goes out to Cailey-Anne. We want her to know she is not in trouble and our primary aim is for her to make contact with family, friends or indeed the police to let us know she is safe and well.'

Cailey-Anne had gone out with friends in Milton Keynes on March 26 but failed to return home to her parents by 11pm as she had been told.

Police have now learned from her closest friend that, three days later, she caught a train with her into London around 9am on Saturday morning.

The friend, who is being debriefed by officers, said they parted ways shortly after arriving in the capital.

CCTV images of Cailey-Anne at Milton Keynes station on Saturday morning released show the 5ft 3ins girl did not have a bag of belongings with her.

The teen, who has long, dark red dyed hair, was wearing light blue leggings, a green Parka body warmer worn over a black leather jacket, and grey Nike Airforce trainers.

Det. Supt Halliday confirmed she had gone missing once before - but added that this was not relevant to his current investigation.

He said: 'There is nothing we are aware of at this stage that gives us a very clear catalyst for disappearing and leaving Milton Keynes in the first place.

'Her parents and family are very concerned and they just want Cailey-Anne back. We are working very closely with specialist trained officers here in Milton Keynes, to make sure the family is fully engaged and supported in this process.

'As any parent would, all they want is their child back or at least confirmation they are safe and well.

'We do not have this at the moment, so I urge Cailey-Anne to please get in touch with someone to let everyone know she is safe and well.'
