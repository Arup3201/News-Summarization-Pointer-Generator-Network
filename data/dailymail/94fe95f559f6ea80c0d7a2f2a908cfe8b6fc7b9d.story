Devastated over the tragic death of 41-year-old Tom Palermo last Saturday, friends and neighbors are incensed about the 'slap on the wrist' $300 fine that allowed Episcopal bishop Heather Cook to get back behind the wheel and end up killing the beloved cyclist and fleeing the scene.

Cook, the daughter of an admitted alcoholic, was three times over Maryland's drunk-driving limit when she was stopped with vomit running down her shirt as she drove for miles on a shredded tire in 2010.

The cop who pulled her over even halted field sobriety tests because he was worried she would fall down and hurt herself DailyMail.com has learned.

Crime, no punishment: Friends and neighbors of hit-and-run victim Tom Palermo are furious that Bishop Heather Cook, 58, was still able to drive an automobile after her serious DUI arrest four years ago

Too young: The victim was Tom Palermo, 41 - a father of two and Baltimore bicycle enthusiast who custom made bike frames as part of his one-man business

'Judges in the United States are reluctant to take people's driving privileges away because our society is so car-dependent,' Greg Hinchliffe, executive director of the Baltimore cyclists' safety group Bikemore told DailyMail.com, 'It certainly seems she got a ridiculously small punishment.

'People who show they do not drive particularly well should not be behind the wheel.'

Cook was let off with supervised probation and an $800 fine — with $500 of it suspended — despite her extreme intoxication.

Defense attorney Zachary Groves told MailOnline that that punishment was at the very bottom of the scale for such a case. 'She must have had a good lawyer,' he said.

'If you blow three times over on a first offence, some judges would bang you up for a weekend or maybe two weekends.'

Cook, who was promoted to Suffragan Bishop, the Episcopal Church's second-ranking position in Maryland two years after her arrest, was behind the wheel of the same green Subaru Forester on Saturday when she hit Palermo, a father of two young children, on his bicycle throwing him on to the hood of her car.

She left him to die at the scene while she drove less than half a mile to her home in Baltimore's Elkridge Estates apartment complex.

Telltale signs: Initial reports indicated that Cook, whose badly damaged car is seen here, hit Palermo and fled the scene. It was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned. This is the same car she was driving when she was arrested for the DUI four years ago

She later returned to the scene of the crash only to drive away again. This time she was tracked to her gated complex by cyclist Moncure Lyon. She then returned a second time when she was questioned by police.

Tom Palermo's funeral will be held in Towson, Maryland, on Saturday. Bikemore is organizing a memorial ride on New Year's Day that is expected to attract hundreds of bikers.

Bikemore's Hinchliffe pointed out that Palermo was riding in a dedicated bike lane on a wide street in perfectly clear daylight. 'He shouldn't be hit from behind at high speed in those circumstances,' he said.

Palermo's family say they are 'focusing on Tom' and do not want to comment on Cook's previous conviction. His funeral will be held in Towson, Maryland, on Saturday. Bikemore is organizing a memorial ride on New Year's Day that is expected to attract hundreds of bikers.

Police refuse to say whether Cook, 58, was breathalyzed after Saturday's accident and say the investigation into the accident is still in its early stages. Detective Ruganzu Howard told DailyMail.com that crash investigators are carrying out 'detailed reconstruction' of the accident and forensic examination of the crash vehicle.

Tributes: 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore,' his friends said. His funeral is Saturday

But cyclists are demanding that the full weight of the law is thrown at the bishop, who has been placed on leave by the church.

A website, titled Charge Bishop Heather Cook With Homicide had gained more than 1,800 'likes' by Wednesday afternoon. One poster wrote: 'The State's Attorney in Caroline County has some SERIOUS explaining to do as to why she got a slap on the wrist for such a serious offense?? If she had done jail time for that DUI, or had been required to have an ignition lock installed in her vehicle, Tom might be alive today.'

Cook was stopped at 2am on September 10, 2010 in the tiny town of Preston in Maryland's Caroline County. She was driving at 29 mph in a 50 mph zone along the shoulder of state Route 318. Her front passenger-side tire was completely shredded, according to the police report obtained by the Baltimore Brew.

Sheriff's Deputy Justin Reibly, who stopped Cook, wrote in his report: 'As I approached the vehicle I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within and the smell of burned rubber. I noted that the driver, who was alone, had vomit down the front of her shirt.'

'I investigated the burned rubber smell and found the front passenger side tire to be 'completely shredded from the rim. (A later search did not find the tire or any parts of it) It appeared that Cook had been riding on the rim for some distance,' Reibly added.

Telltale signs: Initial reports indicated that Cook, whose badly damaged car is seen here, hit Palermo and fled the scene. It was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned (her car is pictured here after she went back to speak to police who were still at the scene)

'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore,' his friends sad 

Reibly said he asked Cook, at that time a parish priest, to follow his finger with her eyes but she could not. 'Cook kept moving her head instead of following my finger with her eyes only, as directed,' he wrote in the report.

When it came to the walk-and-turn test, Reibly wrote: 'Cook was very unstable and was only able to stay in that starting position for a fraction of a second before falling to her left, out of position. Due to Cook not being able to stand up straight without falling, she advised that she could not do the test and she discontinued it herself.'

And things only got worse when he asked her to stand on one leg. 'When she raised that foot, she lost her balance and fell to her left,' the officer wrote. 'She dropped her foot to the ground prior to falling to catch herself.

'Cook’s extremely intoxicated condition precluded her from completing the field sobriety tests. I believed that if Cook continued the testing, she might possibly injure herself, by possibly falling, so I discontinued that test for her safety.'

Reibly found two marijuana baggies and a silver pipe in open view in the car, along with a bottle of wine and a fifth of Jameson Irish whiskey. Cook told Reibly she smoked pot and drank as she drove home to Maryland from Canada

But despite the high level of alcohol in her blood Cook never even went to trial. Instead she was fined and given probation before judgment after pleading guilty.

The Episcopal Diocese of Maryland says Cook revealed her conviction while she was being vetted for the bishop's job in 2012.

Cook is one of six children of the Rev. Halsey Moon Cook, the former rector of Old St. Paul's Church in Baltimore, who died in 1989. He shocked his congregation in 1977 by admitting in a sermon that he was an alcoholic.

Halsey Cook, then 49, went into a Minnesota rehab the following month. He told the Baltimore Sun at the time: 'I was embarrassed for anybody in Baltimore to know so I snuck off quietly 1,400 miles away.'
