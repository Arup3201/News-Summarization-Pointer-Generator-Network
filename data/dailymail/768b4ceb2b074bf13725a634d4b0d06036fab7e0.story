Newcastle have fought off stiff competition from West Ham to land the Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback on a five-year deal.

West Ham had put together a £10 million package that would have put the 24-year-old on a £50,000-per-week package.

That represented a huge wage rise from the basic £6,000-a-week Colback was earning at Sunderland, where he has been since he was 10.

Decision: Jack Colback has decided to sign with Newcastle United rather than West Ham

Got him: Alan Pardew beat off fierce competition to secure his man

However the Newcastle fan is keen to stay in the North east and that appears to have been a huge factor, with Swansea, Aston Villa and Hull all tracking the player.

Colback's move to St James' Park from fierce rivals Sunderland, who were also keen to keep the player, is expected to be confirmed next week.

He will become the first permanent signing made by Newcastle since January 2013, but they will not have to pay a fee with Colback having run down his contract at the Stadium of Light.

Disappointment: Sam Allardyce's West Ham  was one of a number of teams who had been chasing the midfielder

Pay rise: Jack Colback was paid just £6,000-per-week at the Black Cats
