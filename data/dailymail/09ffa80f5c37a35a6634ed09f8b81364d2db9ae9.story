A grandmother who claimed benefits saying  she was too ill to work was exposed as a fraud after it emerged she had posed nude for a charity calendar.

Kay Wilson, 54, maintained she could barely get out of bed after suffering three strokes and was too disabled to even dress herself.

But she was perfectly able to undress herself for the photoshoot at the pie factory where she had been working, a court heard.’

Benefits cheat: Kay Wilson claimed nearly £75,000 in disability benefits but was exposed after pictures of her emerged posing in a calendar to raise money with work colleagues

Jailed: Kay Wilson pocketed almost £75,000 of taxpayers' cash by claiming she was too ill to work and could barely get out of bed after suffering three strokes

Wilson, who pocketed almost £75,000 of
taxpayers’ cash, was jailed for benefit fraud by a judge who told her 
she had seen it as ‘easy money’ .

She claimed disability living 
allowance and severe disablement allowance while holding a string of 
jobs between 2003 and 2011 and earning up to £20,000 a year, 
Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard.

Wilson, of Wetley Rocks, 
Staffordshire, started claiming benefits after suffering a severe stroke
in 1993, saying it would take her 20 minutes to walk ten yards with a 
stick and she was prone to falling.

On a renewal form in 1998 she stated 
she had suffered three strokes in the previous five years and had 
difficulties getting out of bed and dressing herself.

But Wilson carried on claiming 
benefits when she started working at Leek Golf Club, where she  lived 
with her husband, in November 2002.

She then moved on to other jobs before starting work as a sales administrator at Stoke-based Wrights Pies in November 2008.

Benefits: Wilson was still being paid £9,000-a-year in disability living allowance and severe disablement allowance when she was working between 2003 and 2011

Wilson was earning between £15,000 and £20,000 a year while receiving more than £9,000 a year in handouts, the court heard.

While working there, she stripped off 
with workmates in 2011 for a calendar to raise cash for local charities.
After suggesting the idea, she posed provocatively with just plates of 
fairy cakes and pies covering her modesty.

Wilson’s dishonesty was discovered 
when the photos, inspired by  the 2003 comedy film Calendar Girls and 
taken in various locations at Wrights Pies’ factory in Crewe, attracted 
publicity.

Wilson, who admitted two charges of 
failing to notify a change of circumstances in relation to her benefit 
claims, was jailed for 32 weeks. The court heard that more than £11,000 
of the £75,000 she should have repaid was written off when she was 
declared bankrupt.

Jason Holt, for Wilson, said she 
suffered a severe stroke aged 34 and was wheelchair-bound for two years.
She had further strokes and suffered depression.

Sentence: Wilson has been jailed for 32 weeks at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after admitting two charges of failing to notify the DWP of a change of circumstances in relation to her benefit claims

But Mr Holt admitted: ‘At times she was well enough to work.’

Jailing Wilson, Judge Paul Glenn said:
‘People like you, benefit cheats, take away precious public resources 
which would otherwise be spent on worthy causes.

‘You knew what you were doing was 
wrong. You did not voluntarily desist from the false claims, you were 
caught. You got used to  that additional income which was easy money.’

After the hearing, Lord Freud, 
Minister for Welfare Reform, said: ‘Benefit cheats who try to steal from
taxpayers need to know our investigators are actively targeting them.

‘Fraudulently claiming benefits is stealing from the taxpayer and taking support from others who need it.

‘These cheats can end up with criminal records and will have to pay back their ill-gotten gains.
