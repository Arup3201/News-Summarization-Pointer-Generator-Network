Moscow has today denied that its planes approached a Canadian warship on a NATO mission in an incident that officials in Ottawa denounced as 'unnecessarily provocative'.

The Russian defence ministry said a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft and an Antonov An-26 transport plane were carrying out 'planned flights over neutral waters of the Black Sea near the Russian Federation's state border'.

'The flight path of the planes of the Russian airforce ran through an area where the HMCS Toronto was located, without approaching the foreign military vessel,' Major General Konashenkov told Russian news agencies.

He insisted that the Russian jets were behaving 'strictly in line with international rules'.

Canadian Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said on Monday that a Russian military plane had made the 'unnecessarily provocative move' of circling over the Canadian frigate HMCS Toronto. 

The incident took place in the Black Sea where NATO and Ukraine are currently holding naval exercises.

Mr Nicholson said that the Russian aircraft 'did not in any way pose a threat to the Canadian ship'. But he added that 'their actions were unnecessarily provocative and risk escalating tensions even further' in the region.

A Russian Air Force Antonov An-26 transport plane was also among the group said to have circled over the ship

The HMCS Toronto left Canada's Atlantic coast at the end of July with 250 sailors and Sea King helicopters on board to join the NATO mission. 

Russia and the West are locked in a dramatic standoff over a crisis in Ukraine where Kremlin-backed separatists are battling against pro-Western Kiev authorities.

Ukraine said on Monday it had launched three-day naval exercises with US-led NATO forces in the Black Sea aimed at guaranteeing its security.

Mr Nicholson said Canada and its allies are taking part in reassurance measures as a 'direct result of the Putin regime's military aggression and invasion of Ukraine'.
