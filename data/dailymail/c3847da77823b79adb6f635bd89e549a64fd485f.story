'Sacked': Angela Davies, pictured with her Welsh TV presenter husband Arfon Haines Davies, claims she was dismissed eight years after sending an email joking that her boss took cocaine

A marketing executive was sacked eight years after sending an email joking that her company's owner took cocaine, a tribunal heard.

Angela Davies, 63, also gossiped about her boss Robert Mynett's plans to adopt a baby.

Mrs Davies was spoken to about the cocaine email in 2004 but it was brought up again when she told a colleague about Mr Mynett's adoption plans.

She claims she was unfairly sacked after Mr Mynett shouted at her and warned: 'Loose lips sink ships'.

However, Reflex Marketing, based in Cardiff, South Wales, insists that Mrs Davies decided to leave when the atmosphere got 'too awkward'.

Mrs Davies admitted sending an email to a work colleague in 2004 implying that their boss had a cocaine habit.

She told the tribunal: 'It was not a serious allegation - it was nothing more than a joke. Robert was sniffing a lot and I did apologise many times.'

Mrs Davies had known her bosses, brothers Robert and Roger Mynett, for many years because she lived next door to their parents who set up their company which markets luxury Italian furniture in Britain.

Roger Mynett told the tribunal: 'I felt she was obviously very uncomfortable and embarrassed about what had happened in the office.'

But the panel heard Mrs Davies - who is married to a Welsh television presenter - had an 'exemplary discipline record'.

No formal action was taken against her following the cocaine email and she was given a good reference when she left for a better-paid job in 2006.

She rejoined the firm in 2008 but was later accused of discussing Mr Mynett's adoption plans with office manager Karen Jones.

The tribunalÂ  was told Mr Mynett allegedly shouted at her for discussing a 'private matter'.

She told the hearing: 'I could see he was very angry. He referred to the cocaine issue. I was somewhat surprised, as that had taken place 10 years previously.'

Mrs Davies claimed she thought the row was resolved but said she was dismissed when she turned up for work the next morning on June 29 last year.

She added: 'I asked if I should be clearing my desk and he said: "Yes". But I did not want to leave.'

Her husband Arfon Haines Davies, 65, who has appeared on ITV Wales for the last 30 years, told the tribunal: 'My wife was visibly upset. I asked her how things were at work and she got quite emotional and started crying. She told me she had been sacked.

'I know that my wife would not resign - it is not in her nature.'

Robert Mynett told the hearing: 'I had been surprised and upset by her discussion of my private life. I told her that "loose lips sink ships".'

But he claimed she 'fabricated' her version of events - in the same way as she made up the joke about cocaine taking.

Reflex Marketing, based in Cardiff, denies her claim of unfair dismissal. It claims Mrs Davies resigned because it would have been 'unbearable' for her to return to the office after the row with Mr Mynett.

The hearing in Cardiff was adjourned and a decision is expected next week.
