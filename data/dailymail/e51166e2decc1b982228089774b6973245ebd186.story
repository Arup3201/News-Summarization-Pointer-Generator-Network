Roberto Martinez has given Romelu Lukaku his ultimate backing by insisting he would have paid £100million to sign the striker.

Lukaku became the biggest signing in Everton's history at £28m last month and he will be aiming to prove a point when he faces Chelsea for the first time on Saturday.

Diego Costa's hamstring injury, which is likely to rule him out for six-to-seven weeks, has again raised the debate about whether Chelsea were too quick to let the young Belgium centre forward leave, particularly with doubts over Fernando Torres' long-term future and whether Didier Drogba will be as effective in his second spell.

Some have questioned whether Everton paid too much for Lukaku, particularly when Costa only cost Chelsea £4m more, but Martinez is adamant the striker is worth the fee because he is integral to the club's ambitions.

When asked about the difference in the respective fees for Lukaku and Costa, Martinez replied: 'They are different ages and the situation at Atletico Madrid is very different in how they work. Sometimes as a club you have a say and sometimes you have investment groups who have a say. That could be one answer.

'Secondly, it's not about the value. I would have paid £100m for Lukaku. If I had the money, why not? 

'The figure is insignificant. It is about the character and type of player you want in the group. Sometimes a player at £3m can be an expensive buy and sometimes a player at £28m can be a very cheap buy.'

It will be intriguing to see how Lukaku handles the occasion of facing Chelsea, given that there was a cold relationship between him and Jose Mourinho, which stemmed from how the 21-year-old left the club on transfer deadline day 12 months ago to join Everton.

He only made 15 appearance for Chelsea and never scored for them, spending the majority of his three years at Stamford Bridge on loan, but Martinez does not have any concerns that Lukaku – who he expects to be available after a toe problem – will be preoccupied about proving a point.

'I know what you are saying,' said Martinez. 'My answer is of course he is human and leading up to the game people will say you are facing your old team-mates and manager. That is normal. But what I am saying is at this level, the level of performance will not change from against Arsenal or Leicester.

'He has a status and vital role for us. I see him wanting to play 90 minutes against Leicester when he was not ready, and wanting to stay on against Arsenal when it would be easy for him to say he wanted to be ready for Chelsea and so wait until he is 100 per cent.

'He is not going through the motions he is raising his levels. Every game he is fresh so I do not see any difference at all. Rom has found a very strong inner motivation. We are excited about what he can give us. It is not about him facing his former club.'
