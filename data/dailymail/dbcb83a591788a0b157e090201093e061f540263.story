Kimi Raikkonen can offer no excuses for his poor start as Ferrari technical director James Allison says it's simply because he's driving 'slower than Fernando (Alonso) at the moment'.

The anticipated duel with Alonso has failed to materialise with the Spaniard out-qualifying Raikkonen in four of the six races and, crucially, finishing ahead in every grand prix.

Raikkonen is languishing in 12th place while Alonso is the best of the rest when it comes to drivers' standings, third only to runaway Mercedes pair Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.

In terms of points, Alonso has amassed 61 compared to Raikkonen's less-than-impressive 17.

Alonso is in his fifth season with Ferrari and has full knowledge of how the team works, while Raikkonen is only in the first year of his return to the Maranello marque.

The cars, however, were a clean slate given the radical regulations. But Raikkonen seems to not have adapted to the changes as naturally as Alonso.

'I'm not sure it's entirely fair to say he is struggling more than Fernando,' said Allison in assessing Raikkonen's form to date ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.

'They both have similar feedback with the car, and there are aspects of this year's rules that make the cars across the pit-lane a far from easy aspect for the driver.

'There is a lot more torque from the engine, a lot less aerodynamic grip, and the tyres are deliberately less aggressive than last year.

'All that means they are quite a handful to drive, not too breezy for anyone, be that at the front or back of the grid.

'The
 problems Kimi has with the car under braking, downshifting, are the 
same as Fernando, and pretty much the same as being experienced by other
 drivers at other teams.

'He's just going a little slower than Fernando at the moment, but that gap is closing as the year progresses.'

Ferrari expected to be in the hunt for this year's championships, only for Mercedes to outclass them after the rules overhaul.

It is Allison's first full season as technical director after leaving Lotus a year ago, and he recognises the sizable task.

'It's tough. Making a car quick that wasn't quick in the first race is a particularly challenging task,' added Allison.

'It's very difficult to produce a rate of improvement substantially different to the people we are fighting with.

'However, we've had a race or two where the pieces we took to the track were useful, but not big steps forward.

'We hope in the coming races to have a more steady progression of things we hope will lift us up in our competitiveness.

'But we won't know for sure until we get there because it depends on what everyone else does.

'I don't think we can claim to have produced a chassis that is, at the moment, the equal of either the Mercedes or the Red Bull.

'We're not lagging hugely behind, but there is work for us to do before we can hold our hands up and say we are completely happy with the chassis performance.'
