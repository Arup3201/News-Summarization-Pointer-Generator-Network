Paralympic gold medalist Victoria Arlen, who is paralyzed from the waist down, has been told she cannot take part in the Montreal World Championships days before it took place because she is not disabled enough.

The New Hampshire teenager, who won a gold medal in the London Games last year, was already in Montreal with Team USA when the International Paralympic Committee made its ruling.

The IPC decided that 18-year-old Victoria, who was paralyzed by a rare neurological disorder seven years ago, was not suffering from a permanent disability and so was not eligible to be a paralympian.

Disappointed: Gold medal winner Victoria Arlen, who is paralyzed, has been told she is no longer eligible to be a Paralympian

'I’m so heartbroken with what has happened,' Victoria said, according to NESN.

In a Facebook post the swimmer, who broke world records for the 100m and 400m freestyle, said: 'To have trained so hard this past year 
and come so far only to be humiliated and targeted by the IPC for 
reasons unknown baffles me.'

A statement released by the IPC, on the opening day of the world championships on Sunday, said: 'IPC Swimming can confirm that Victoria 
Arlen of the USA will not participate at the 2013 IPC Swimming World 
Championships and future IPC Swimming competitions having failed to 
provide conclusive evidence of a permanent eligible impairment.'

When Victoria competed as part of team USA at the London Olympics last year she was classified as between being a 5 and 6 in a system where 15 is nearly able-bodied, according to ABC News.

Because of her paralysis she swims with only her arms.

Victoria, who was a runner up for ESPY's Best Female Athlete with a Disability award this year, developed a rare neurological condition that paralyzed her and left her in a coma for three years.

The condition, transverse myelitis in association with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM, damages nerve cell fibers in the body.

'It started off with flu-like symptoms and pain, then I started feeling really funny,' she said. 'In two weeks I was paralyzed from the waist down ... every ability I had was slowly slipping away.'

The IPC had requested more analysis into her condition after the London Games last year.

A report was provided by USOC in July and, after references to the swimmer's name was removed, it was sent to five independent medical experts for their opinion, IPC spokesman Lucy Dominy wrote to ABC News.

'All were in agreement that the report, its assessment and its diagnosis fail to provide sufficient evidence of an eligible impairment leading to permanent or verifiable activity limitation - which is required under the IPC Swimming Classification Rules and Regulations,' she said.

Victoria's father was disgusted by the ruling, saying: 'This kid has trained seven days a week for years and now she is being railroaded out.'

He added: 'What kills me is their people have no experience with my daughter's disease and have given an opinion. They've got every disability in this organization, but this is discrimination. It's crazy.'

New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan has also rallied on the teenager's behalf.

In a letter to the IPC she wrote: 'The basis for ruling Victoria ineligible - the possibility that she might one day be able to resume use of her legs - is nothing short of disgraceful, undermining the very values of courage, inspiration, determination and equality that the International Paralympic Committee aims to promote.'

A doctor contacted by the family to ensure Victoria would not become further paralyzed through her condition, had suggested that the teenager could one day be able to walk again if she had years of physical therapy.

Dr Michael Levy, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, added however: 'It will take many months to years to get Ms Arlen back on her feet. I did not mean to imply that Ms Arlen would be able to walk quickly.'

'Please do not misconstrue my plan as a statement of permanence of her disability,' he said, according to ABC News.

Victoria said: 'I am not walking now and I won’t be in the near future, that’s for sure.'

'I want to remain hopeful and I am being penalized for being hopeful,' she added, according to CBS Boston.

After being turned away from the Montreal championships, Victoria went to California with her mother and boyfriend. 

The triplet, who has three brothers, 
said: 'I am keeping my head held high and I am not bitter, discouraged 
or angry against them.'
