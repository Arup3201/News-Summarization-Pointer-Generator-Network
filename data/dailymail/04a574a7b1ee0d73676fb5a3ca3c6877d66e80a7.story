Jacqueline Williams hanged herself after she was admitted to hospital with a history of suicide attempts and left on her own for 20 minutes 

The family of a mother-of-three who killed herself after being left alone by hospital staff despite being admitted because she was distressed have branded the NHS a 'broken' system. 

Jacqueline Williams, 42, was suffering from depression and had a history of suicide attempts when she was admitted into Royal Blackburn Hospital, and died two hours later in a side room of the A&E department.

The former carer's family said they feel let down by the health service and believe the 'broken system' has led to staff cuts and a lack of knowledge about mental health, which meant she was left alone with enough time to hang herself.

Her husband said she had previously begged to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.  

Lisa Turner, 43, said: 'If the NHS hadn't been cutting corners then my sister would still be here. I do feel the NHS is a broken system that has failed us and shockingly it isn't just happening to us but everybody else. This broken system that we see in the news all the time I believe has led directly to my beloved sister's death.

'We hear so much in the news about it and loads has come out in terms of waiting times at A&Es and staff shortages. How long can this go on for? 

'People are dying because of stupid mistakes. Apparently it takes seven weeks for people who need psychiatric care to get help.'

Mrs Williams, who used to work as a carer at Abiden Rest Home in Burnley, had been mourning the death in 2013 of her father-in-law but her depression worsened in October last year and she was twice admitted to hospital for trying to kill herself. 

On January 26 - a Monday - Mrs Williams went out for a walk saying she wanted to 'clear her head' only to be found loitering at canal bridge at 10.30pm by a member of the public.

An ambulance took her to the hospital where she was seen then left alone in a windowless room next to a nurses' station. It is believed she shut the door and was left alone for about 20 minutes, during which she hanged herself.

Mrs Williams, of Burnley, was found at 12.52am and died after attempts to revive her.

Her sister said they believed staff shortages meant Mrs Williams was left alone, despite it being a Monday evening which is often quieter. 

Royal Blackburn Hospitals is likely to face questions about its treatment of patients with mental health issues

She added: 'It is ridiculous. It should never have happened and was so preventable. If more staff had been on that night, hand on my heart, I think my sister would still be alive.

'They must have been just understaffed. People go to hospital for safety and treatment but nowadays it seems they are dying in there. It's safer being in prison as at least inmates on suicide watch are checked every 10 minutes.'

Ms Turner said she believes her sister hanged herself as a 'cry for help' and thought staff would be keeping an eye on her.  

Mrs Williams' sister Lisa Turner said she believe staff shortages are to blame for her death 

Wayne Williams said his wife had begged to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act after being admitted 

Mrs Williams' husband Wayne, 47, a caretaker at Sabden Primary School in Lancashire said: 'This is the third time she has been to A&E and she has attempted suicide twice before and every time she has been discharged at the end of the night. Plain and simple she should have been watched. They would have had her medical records with her past history. She should not have been allowed to close the door.

He added: 'The fact someone could take their own life in an A&E is disgusting. There should have been one-to-one checks or someone sat with her. No one called me to let me know she was even there. So she didn't have anyone there for her.

'If someone had checked her records they would realise not to leave her alone. If they had just made a phone call to me then she would still be here today. We would have had a conversation, I could have calmed her down and it would have been fine. I feel sorry for whoever found her. She shouldn't have been in A&E.'

Mr Williams is to make a formal complaint about the treatment of his wife.  

The family were called to the hospital at midnight on the evening she died, and told by staff to come quickly because she was very poorly. When they arrived they were told she was dead.

An inquest was opened and adjourned earlier this week.

Dr Ian Stanley, Acting Medical Director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Our sympathies are with the patient's family at this very difficult time. This tragic incident is now the subject of a coroner's inquest and the Trust will be undertaking a multi-agency investigation into the circumstances that led to this and for this reason, we are unable to comment further.'

Concerns have previously been raised about a lack of support for patients with mental health problems at Blackburn’s emergency department.

Mr and Mrs Williams married in 2006 and the widower says he is to make a formal complaint to the hospital 

Last year, the Care Quality Commission highlighted delays for patients requiring psychiatric assessments, and ordered the hospital to carry out a review of its facilities and resources. It found that despite an agreement for mental health practitioners to respond within one hour of being called, staff and managers said this was ‘frequently not achieved’.

The hospital’s procedures were also called into question after a 53-year-old male patient, Terence Mullin, hanged himself in the Medical Assessment Unit, which works closely with the emergency department.

He was admitted in January last year after taking an intentional overdose of insulin, and had been assessed by a mental health liaison nurse as being at high risk of further suicide attempts.

Coroner Michael Singleton criticised the hospital’s safeguarding procedures during an inquest last summer, which prompted a ‘thorough review and improvement plan’.

The death of Mrs Williams may also pose questions for Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust, which provides the mental health liaison service with the hospital. 

When asked if the hospital was a member of the Psychiatric Liaison Accreditation Network, created by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to assure and improve psychiatric care in hospitals, the trust said it was ‘considering joining’.

Bosses at the Royal Blackburn thought the Network was not available to them, as they do not provide the liaison service, but a spokesman for the Royal College said it is open to ‘any hospital and any emergency department’.
