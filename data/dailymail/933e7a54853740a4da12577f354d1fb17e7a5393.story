Find: The skeletons of four adults and a child (pictured) have been discovered behind a townhouse in central Edinburgh

They were the real-life bogeymen whose murderous trade in bodies for medical research led to their names going down forever in infamy.

Now, bones from five skeletons found in a shallow grave behind an upmarket townhouse in Edinburgh are thought to be linked to the period of 'resurrectionists' William Burke and William Hare.

Archaeologists have determined that the five bodies - four adults and one child, which were found in Grove Street in the Haymarket area of the capital - date back to the early 19th century.

Burke and Hare gained their murderous reputation after killing 16 people in the city in 1828 and selling the bodies.

At the time there was a market for corpses and the remains are thought to belong to criminals or dwellers of poorhouses, who could also be sold on.

John Lawson, from the City of Edinburgh Council Archaeology Service, was the first to examine the remains on site.

He said: 'At the end of the Enlightenment period there was significant demand for cadavers - which indeed outstripped supply - and that led to a thriving illegal trade, with Burke and Hare clearly the most infamous of those who supplied bodies to medical schools.

'We can't rule out that those found on Grove Street were sold by the resurrectionists, as they were called, although it might be a stretch to say it was Burke and Hare themselves, given their crimes are well documented.

'It is possible that, given the fact they may have been acquired illegally, that someone should wish to bury them, or it could have been as simple as a house clearance.

'What we do know is that these were used to train the surgeons of the future and are a relic of our heritage, of that early stage of modern medicine.

'I'm not sure how far the project will go but there are techniques to determine where the remains came from by the kind of water they drank, the diet they had.

'It was just a chance discovery but despite the length of time that has passed we always like to put the person into context, how old they were, how they died, who they were.'

Maureen Kilpatrick, a lead archaeologist at consultants Guard Archaeology, said: 'We found four right-sided jaws and we also had enough bone likely to be a young person. There were quite a few little holes in them which were to cater for wires, which leads us to believe they were used for anatomical purposes.

'We found they were likely to date back to the early 1800s, and although there were no medical professionals living in the house, we believe they had friends who were.'

Irish immigrants Burke and Hare sold the bodies of the dead on to Dr Robert Knox to use for medical research and teaching.

When they were arrested, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he testified against Burke, as authorities feared they would blame each other - making it difficult for a jury to convict.

More than 25,000 people watched Burke hang in 1829 while Hare disappeared after his release.

Burke's skeleton is displayed at the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum. His death mask is exhibited at Surgeon's Hall in the capital.

Over a period of ten months in 1828, 16 murders were committed in the Scottish capital.

The killings were carried out by two Irish immigrants William Burke and William Hare - who then sold the corpses of their victims.

Local doctor Robert Knox received the bodies as dissection material for his anatomy lectures.

In order to keep the bodies in a good condition, the two killed their victims by smothering them, compressing their chests until they died.

The duo did not work alone. Burke's mistress Helen McDougal and Margaret Laird, Hare's wife,  assisted them in their murderous spree.

Burke was born in Urney, County Tyrone. He left his family - a wife and two children - to emigrate to Scotland in around 1817, and met his mistress while working on the Union Canal.

Hare's birthplace is less certainly documented, but it is thought he was from either Poyntzpass near Newry, or Derry.

He emigrated to Scotland and also worked as a labourer on the Union Canal.

The duo met when Burke and his mistress moved in to Hare's wife's lodgings in around 1827.

According to Hare' testimony -  the first body the duo sold was that of a tenant who died of natural causes in November of that year.

Burke was executed in 1829 but Hare escaped being hanged after giving evidence against his former accomplice.
