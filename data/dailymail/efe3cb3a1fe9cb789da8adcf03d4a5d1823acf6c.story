The three Maslin children, who died when Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July, have finally arrived back on Australian soil.

The bodies of Mo, 12, Evie, 10 and Otis, 8, will be returned to their loved ones in Perth after arriving on board an RAAF Globemaster transport plane in Melbourne at about 4:30pm on Thursday, according to the Herald Sun.

Mo, Evie and Otis were three of 38 Australians who died in the disaster which claimed a total of 298 lives when a surface-to-air-missile shot the passenger plane out of the sky.

They are believed to have arrived alongside a number of other victims of the tragedy.

Families of the deceased were seen waiting at Melbourne airport as the plane arrived and watched on as the coffins were removed from the plane.

A total of 10 hearses were then seen making their way to Melbourne Coroner's Court where the certification process will take place before the victim's remains can be received by their loved ones.

The Herald Sun reports that 27 victims have already been returned to Australia and only two more still require identification in Eindhoven.

In July, the parents of the three Maslin children released a statement addressed to 'the soldiers in the Ukraine, the politicians, the media, our friends and family'.

Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris wrote: 'Our pain is intense and relentless. We live in a hell beyond hell.

'Our babies are not here with us – we need to live with this act of horror, every day and every moment for the rest of our lives. 

'No one deserves what we are going through. Not even the people who shot our whole family out of the sky.'
