British detectives are hoping to finally catch the killer of a young woman brutally murdered in Thailand 13 years ago after they were given full access to the case files for the first time.

Kirsty Jones, 23, was raped and strangled at a guesthouse in northern Thailand in 2000 while enjoying a gap year after university.

After 13 years her killer has never been brought to justice - and Kirsty's desperate family feared the trail had gone cold.

Tragedy: Liverpool University gradute Kirsty Jones went to Chiang Mai as part of her big trip - going on jungle hikes, riding elephants and visiting tribes - before she was raped and strangled

But the British detective investigating the murder said he is 'very optimistic' the case can be solved after being given full access to all files for the first time by the Thai authorities.

Detective Superintendent Andy John - who led the investigation which caught April Jones' killer Mark Bridger - said advances in DNA and fresh interviews with witnesses could provide a breakthrough.

He said his team have been given full access to all the material gathered by the Department of Special Investigation in Thailand and would be re-interviewing British witnesses who have since returned home.

Det Supt John said: 'We see these developments as very significant.

'We know from our experience in the UK with cold case reviews that some cases are solved many years after they occurred and there's nothing to say we can't find a similar outcome in this case.

'The fact that we are undertaking a forensic review in the UK using the best resources available in the field is an extremely positive step.

Grieving: Kirsty's mother Sue Jones and her son Gareth are hopeful that British detectives will be able to find the backpacker's killer

'The DSI are in the process of 
reinvestigating this inquiry and we are keen to support and where 
possible, assist the Thai authorities.

'They have done a considerable amount of work, we've seen proof of that during the visit to Thailand last year.'

Kirsty's
battling mum Sue Jones said the new developments have provided a boost 
to the family to 'keep forging on' in their fight for justice.

Farmer's daughter Kirsty grew up in the village of Tredomen, near Brecon, Mid Wales.

But
she dreamed of seeing the world and had decided from the age of 14 that
she had wanted to take a gap year before going on to university.

In 1996 when she set off for Australia and stopped off in Thailand on her way home.

After a safe and successful trip, the bright A-level student had fallen in love with travelling.

She
completed an English and media studies degree at Liverpool University 
in 1999 - then spent a year doing odd jobs to fund her next big trip.

She had planned a two-year global adventure taking in Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand before finishing in South America.

Her family said they felt no reason to worry second time around as Ms Jones was older, wiser and more experienced.

Kirsty headed 435 miles north of Bangkok to the well-known trekking hub Chiang Mai - going on jungle hikes, riding elephants and visiting hill tribes.

But a month later the dream was shattered when her parents were given the devastating news that their daughter had been raped and strangled to death.

Despite a series of arrests, no-one has faced justice for her murder.

But DS John, of the Dyfed Powys force in Wales, said: 'We see these developments as very significant.

'You know from your experience in the UK with cold case reviews that some cases are solved many years after they occurred and there's nothing to say we can't find a similar outcome in this case.

'The fact that we are undertaking a forensic review in the UK using the best resources available in the field is an extremely positive step.'

'in the UK we are advanced in many respects in terms of the way we approach criminal investigations and the access to specialists that we have.

'And I just want to maximise the opportunities which we've got.'

DS John, who has worked on some of the biggest cases in the forces' history, including the investigation into the abduction and murder of five-year-old April Jones.

He added he was 'very optimistic' new evidence would be found from the forensic review given recent advances in technology.
