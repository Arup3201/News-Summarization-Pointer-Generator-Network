The dangers of Chinese sky lanterns are to be examined by a government study which could pave the way for them to be banned, MailOnline has learned.

Ministers are poised to launch an independent study to assess the scale of the risks posed to livestock, crops and the environment.

The probe will look at international efforts to limit their impact and consider their value to the economy after a boom in popularity of releasing the lanterns at weddings, festivals and parties.

A government study into the safety of sky lanterns will examine their use around the world. Dozens are pictured being released in Thailand

The image of sky lanterns filing the sky has made them popular for weddings, parties and festivals but ahead of Bonfire Night, ministers are urging people to think twice about using them

Farming leaders have long called for a ban on the lanterns, complaining that when the wire frames fall back to earth they can be eaten by cattle.

Several cows have died as a result of choking on small pieces of wire chopped up into hay or silage when crops are harvested, according to the National Farmers’ Union.

New farming minister David Heath, who warned of the dangers of the lanterns in opposition, is to order a study into the dangers and urged people to ‘think carefully’ before using them.

He said: ‘The Government is aware of 
concerns about the impacts of sky lanterns on animals, crops and 
property and has taken steps to raise public awareness about the 
potential dangers sky lanterns pose, and to encourage people to think 
carefully before using them.

New Farming Minister David Heath said an independent study would look at the risks posed to the environment, livestock and plants

‘We will continue to look for further opportunities to do this over the coming months, especially as we approach bonfire night.

‘In order to assess the extent of the dangers posed by sky lanterns and possible steps to address such dangers, Defra proposes to commission an independent study to examine in detail the scale of the risks associated with the use of sky lanterns, and their impact on livestock, plants and the environment.

‘The results of this study will help inform any future Government action.’

Before the general election Mr Heath suggested he did not want to ban the lanterns, but there are concerns that even a move to alternatives using wicker instead of wire have failed to remove all the risks.

In addition to the threat posed to livestock, there are also dangers that a lit flame could ignite crops or hedgerows during dry weather.

Louise Staples, rural surveyor for the NFU, said today: ‘These types of lanterns may be fun and look pretty when they’re lit but they can pose a real danger to farms and farm animals, especially livestock in fields.

‘Cattle can eat the wire in the lantern which finds its way into the silage they are fed. The lanterns land in fields, are chopped up into small pieces when grass is gathered and made into silage. If swallowed, the wire can puncture the stomach lining, causing extreme pain and in some cases can be fatal.

The NFU says some cows have died after choking on the wire frames of lanterns which have been chopped up into feed

‘There’s also a good chance that the wire part of the frame could get wrapped around an animal's foot, become embedded in the skin and would cause extreme pain.

‘Obviously, fire is also another major problem particularly during the summer. These lanterns can pose a serious risk if they land in a field of crops or straw. Perhaps worse is if they come down near a barn or even by a thatched house which could easily catch fire.’

Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh, who tabled parliamentary questions about the problem, said: 'Many people enjoy letting off Chinese lanterns to celebrate special occasions, but there are complaints from farmers about the harm they can cause to farm animals and machinery.  

'We welcome this research into those issues so that the government has the full facts at its finfertips before changing the law.'

The NFU has urged its members to contact any venues near their farms using lanterns to warn them of the dangers and pleasing with them not to use them.

A Defra spokesman said: ‘Given the concerns and complaints that are being made about the damage sky lanterns can do, we want to find out just what effect they are having on farming and the environment.’
