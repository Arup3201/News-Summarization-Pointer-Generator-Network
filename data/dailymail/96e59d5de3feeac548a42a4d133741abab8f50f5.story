A shop owner who makes a living shopping at Trader Joe's in the U.S. and reselling the goods for a profit in his Canadian store has won a legal battle against the retail giant.

Pirate Joe's owner Michael Hallatt said he felt 'vindicated' after a judge ruled his Vancouver outlet did not damage the Trader Joe's brand.

Trader Joe's slapped Hallatt with a lawsuit in May alleging trademark infringement and false advertising, and arguing the 600-square-foot retailer was hurting its reputation.

Victor: Michael Hallatt, who makes a living buying Trader Joe's products in the U.S. and selling them in his Canadian shop, has won a legal fight against the retailer

Fearless: After his court victory, Hallatt changed the chalkboard sign at the front of his shop from 'Unauthorized, Unaffiliated, Unafraid' to 'We won!'

But U.S. district Judge Marsha Pechman dismissed the federal suit, ruling there was no basis to apply a U.S. law known as the Lanham Act, which confers upon U.S. courts broad jurisdictional powers.

CBC News reported Pechman said all the alleged infringements take place in Canada, and Trader Joe's cannot show economic harm.

Hallatt, 53, said Wednesday's ruling was appropriate because he pays full-price for Trader Joe's products.

He changed a catchphrase on a chalkboard outside his shop from 'Unauthorized. 
Unaffiliated. Unafraid' to 'We Won!'

'The Lanham Act, which is this very broad powerful statute that allows corporations to, kind of, you know, beat up on anybody that affects U.S. commerce is very, very strong and powerful and can essentially shut down commerce in another country,' he said. 

'It really had to be black and white that we were not affecting U.S. commerce at all. And so for us to have it dismissed, it really had to be black and white that we were not affecting U.S. commerce at all.'

Business continuity: Hallatt will be allowed to continue selling Trader Joe's goods at his Pirate Joe's shop

Passionate: Hallatt opened his store last year and said his customers love it

NBC News reported
Trader Joe's has the option to file a claim under state law against 
Hallatt within 10 days. The company hasn't said if it will pursue 
further legal action.

'We 
sell our products in our stores to our customers; and to maintain the 
goodwill and integrity of the Trader Joe’s brand, it is extremely 
important to us to protect and preserve the customer experience we have 
developed in our stores over the past 46 years,' Trader Joe's said in a 
statement on Thursday.

'While
we are disappointed and disagree with the Court’s determination that it
could not exercise jurisdiction over the defendant’s activities in 
Canada, we will continue to do everything in our power to protect our 
trademarks and the integrity of our products for our customers.'

Hallatt has spent more than $350,000 buying food at the
popular U.S. grocery chain since opening his store last year. 

He fills his panel van with up to $5000 of shopping each week 
then drives it all back to his shop.

'I'm their best customer,' Hallatt told Sfgate.com.'Almost all the stores in the Pacific Northwest have asked me to leave.'

Time to respond: Trader Joe's has 10 days to appeal the ruling which allows Pirate Joe's to continue selling their products in Canada

Winning: Hallatt said he felt vindicated by the ruling because his shop 'wasn't affecting U.S. commerce at all'

He charges $CAD4.99 
Canadian dollars for milk chocolate-covered potato chips that go for 
$US2.99 US and $CAD5.99 for a gluten free granola bar that sells for
$US3.49.

He
will go to any lengths to get his groceries, one time even cross 
dressing in a leopard muumuu, earrings and flowered flip-flops but 
someone called the police.

'My nail polish was not even dry when three cops showed up,' Hallatt recalled.

The trader told Sfgate he turns a modest profit after paying for gas, goods, duty, rent and salaries.

He offers 1,000 products and does not carry fresh or frozen foods.
