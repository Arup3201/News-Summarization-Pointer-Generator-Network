Britain's shambolic Border Agency has routinely dropped or downgraded major immigration controls for the past five years without ministerial approval, a devastating report revealed last night.

It found up to half a million Eurostar passengers arriving from French tourist resorts, including Disneyland Paris, were waved into Britain without facing any anti-terror checks.

The European nationals were not examined against the Home Office’s so-called Warnings Index, which contains details of terrorists and dangerous criminals who must be refused entry to keep the public safe.

Concerns: Home Secretary Theresa May has revealed how security checks at Britain's borders have been routinely suspended, including on an occasion when Immigration Minister Damian Green authorised the downgrading

The report also showed how millions of pounds was wasted on schemes which did not work, with ministers being regularly fed misleading information by  civil servants.

Foreign students were let in if they ‘appeared to be genuine’.

Last night, as Home Secretary Theresa May announced that she is to split the dysfunctional agency into two, a terrifying culture of arrogance and incompetence emerged.

The report, which was ordered after last  year’s revelations that senior civil servants were abandoning passport checks, provoked fury, with MPs criticising Britain’s ‘Mickey Mouse’ immigration controls. Yesterday’s report also revealed how:

The report, by John Vine, chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, was commissioned last year following the so-called ‘Brodiegate’ scandal.

Taking liberties: The official investigation into the relaxation of border checks last year found staff went 'over and beyond' any scheme approved by ministers

It saw former chief Brodie Clark resign after the Home Secretary accused him of weakening controls without her permission.

Yesterday’s report appeared to clear ministers of downgrading checks, saying that border staff went ‘beyond’ what was approved.

As the chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Brian Moore guided it to its current status as the safest in England and Wales.

He will leave the post to set up the UK Border Force, a new Government agency tasked with policing arrivals in Britain.

Christopher Hoare, chair of Wiltshire 
Police Authority said: 'We are supporting this secondment of Brian Moore
to the UK Border Force where he will be engaged in work of national 
importance.

'We
are sure he will make an invaluable contribution, and felt that his 
skills and experience should be made available in the national interest.

'Brian
became Wiltshire's Chief Constable in January 2008 and under his 
leadership Wiltshire has become the safest county in England and Wales.

'We know he will be greatly missed by the public, Wiltshire Police and our partners.

'WPA recognises, and is very grateful for, Brian's outstanding contribution to the policing of Wiltshire and Swindon.'

Deputy
Chief Constable Patrick Geenty will take over from Mr Moore until a new
chief constable is appointed, which will not be until November at the 
earliest.

The WPA said the new appointment would be a priority once a new commissioner had been sworn in on November 22.

However, it revealed Immigration Minister Damian Green did  authorise the downgrading of checks early last year. Mrs May later made clear her opposition but this instruction was ignored.

In her statement to MPs yesterday, she said that from next month the Border Force – the part of the UKBA responsible for checking those trying to enter the country – will be hived off.

Wiltshire Police chief constable Brian Moore will replace Mr Clark and will be ‘directly accountable’ to ministers, Mrs May said. The remaining part of UKBA will be responsible for processing immigration applications.

Mrs May told MPs: ‘The Vine report reveals a border force that suspended important checks  without permission; that spent  millions on new technologies but chose not to use them; that was led by managers who did not communicate with their staff; and that sent reports to ministers that were inaccurate, unbalanced and excluded key information.’

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This just shows that the UK Border Agency is a real Mickey Mouse operation. Unfortunately it is neither entertaining nor funny. It is run by clowns for their own advantage and convenience.’ The report revealed that since 2007, passengers on trains arriving from Avignon, Bourg St Maurice and Disneyland station Marne-la-Vallee had their passports examined but no more detailed checks were carried out.

Separately, Warnings Index checks were abandoned more than 350 times, mostly at  so-called ‘juxtaposed controls’ – immigration posts in France.

Agency records suggest the checks were abandoned for up to six hours at Calais, when staff were faced with traffic jams at the port and justified the suspension on ‘health and safety grounds’. The students scheme – codenamed Operation Savant – operated during the peak rush of new arrivals from September last year.

It allowed Heathrow officials to let in students from ‘low risk’  countries if they ‘otherwise appeared to be genuine students’.

Mr Vine said the policy was ‘potentially unlawful’. The report stated: ‘We cannot say whether  any student was admitted into the UK unlawfully under this initiative and any potential risks to security cannot be quantified.’

Chip reading facilities were ‘deactivated’ nearly 15,000 times at ten ports between January and June last year, Mr Vine said.

Astonishingly, the Border Agency was ‘unable to explain definitively why these deactivations occurred’.

Yesterday’s final, terminal blow for UKBA follows a string of scandals for the immigration system going back years.

In 2006, then home secretary John Reid branded the immigration  system ‘not fit for purpose’. The criticism was repeated by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee in a report two years ago.

Mr Clark resigned in November last year claiming constructive  dismissal. He is likely to receive a substantial payoff despite yesterday’s report and a similar internal inquiry finding against him.

trains in France and arrived in the UK without being checked against the
warnings index of suspected terrorists and those with adverse 
immigration histories

JAMES SLACK:

Lord knows how many maniacs, having learned of this gaping hole in our already porous borders - and they do learn very quickly - piled in.

The internal review by former police officer David Wood found Mr Clark took the action he did because he wanted ‘quick wins’ to cut queues at airports.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper last night accused Mrs May of ‘passing the buck’. ‘It is clear that on Theresa May’s watch border controls were substantially weakened last summer compared to previous years,’ she added.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said  yesterday: ‘The Home Secretary’s proposals do not go far enough.

‘A separate border force will allow a more focused view on what is happening. However, there is a danger in assuming that structural changes will solve these problems.

‘What is needed is root and branch reform, not changing faces but cultures. This is day one for the future of UKBA. The Home Secretary should abandon her Chihuahua approach and become a pit bull. Otherwise her failures will come back to bite her.’
