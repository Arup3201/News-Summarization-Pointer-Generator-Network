Lucy Adams speaking at the Commons Public Accounts Committee earlier this week

The BBC is under growing pressure to fire its director of human resources after she was accused of lying to MPs about the severance pay scandal.

Lucy Adams, who earns £320,000 a year, said she could not recall using the word in a leaked email which was discussed at the Commons Public Accounts Committee this week. 

But when asked if she had used the term, Adams replied: 'I may have used the term by means of an incentive to get a swift resolution.' 

Adams has already said she will leave the BBC in April but there are calls for her resign now.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘She should go now. She has been proved to be incompetent and she misled the committee. After her performance this week, the BBC has significant grounds to let her go immediately.

‘Here you have a highly paid woman who hasn’t been behaving in the way that she should, but is allowed to dictate the terms of her own departure.

‘If the BBC is to regain the public trust, it needs to get a grip and start disciplinary proceedings against all those who signed off excessive severance payments.’

Cheers reportedly rang out in the BBC newsroom on Monday when Adams was branded a liar by MPs. 

Miss Adams protested the verdict on her was unfair, but committee chairman Margaret Hodge declared: 'You're developing a habit of changing your evidence.' 

Miss Adams was accused of completely contradicting herself. 

At one point, Mrs Hodge told her: 'I'm not having any more lies this afternoon.' 

The outburst apparently sparked a wave of disloyal jubilation within the Corporation as staff watched the exchange on live television.

The BBC’s own media correspondent, the respected Nick Higham, tweeted: ‘There was an audible cheer in the BBC newsroom when Margaret Hodge accused BBC HR director Lucy Adams of lying to the PAC.’

Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who also a member of the committee, says he obtained the email. He said: ‘The email shines a light on the real culture of the HR department which saw payments [that went beyond] contractual terms as simply perks of the job.

‘Clearly the decision to leave the BBC removed some of the need for further questioning, but it was clear she had lost the confidence of the committee in the accuracy of her recollections.’

He added: ‘I think her position is untenable and it is surprising that she will be continuing at the BBC until next spring when it is clear that, on more than one occasion, she denied any knowledge of material documents that she wrote before parliament.

‘I found it a very sad day to see an institution with so many talented and hard-working staff being led by people paid telephone-number salaries and performing in a way that fell far short of what those staff deserve.’

Another MP on the committee, Guto Bebb, said the ‘sweetener’ email was a ‘clear sign of the attitude of senior executives at the BBC to these above-contract payments’.

He added: ‘Whilst concern about sweeteners for senior officers was expressed, the evidence from the NAO shows that as you go down the ‘food chain’ your chances of an above-contract deal receded.’

A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘Although the BBC has not seen the email, Lucy Adams explained the context in which this term might be used at the hearing.’
