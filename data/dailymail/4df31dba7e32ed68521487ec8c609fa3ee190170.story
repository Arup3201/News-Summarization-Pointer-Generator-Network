Nicky Morgan, the new Education Secretary, said she would be 'nice' to teachers

The new education secretary Nicky Morgan has vowed to keep the controversial rules which punish parents who take their children out of school during term time.

In her first interview since she was asked to replace Michael Gove last week, Mrs Morgan said the zero-tolerance policy on holidays during class time sends ‘a firm signal’.

‘For every day or half-day that a child misses. It does affect their education’, she said. ‘From the prime minister downwards, we have made it clear that being in school during term time is that best place for children to be. I'm really clear that will continue.’

Mrs Morgan has called for an end to the Government war on teachers, just days after taking over from Michael Gove.

Nicky Morgan said she wanted to be 'nice' to teachers to get the best out of them.

Her remarks are in stark contrast to her predecessor Mr Gove who infuriated teachers and unions by attacking the education establishment as a block on change.

Allies of the former Education Secretary claim his demotion in last week's reshuffle signalled that the Government had lost its war against the teaching unions - which they refer to as 'the blob'.

But Mrs Morgan - the privately educated mother of one - said working with 'the system' was crucial to get the best results for children.

She said: 'I will obviously be nice to teachers, because working with teachers and heads and governors and everyone else in the system is critical in getting the best outcome for our children. Education can be life-transforming.'

But she insisted she would not turn her back on the changes championed by Mr Gove, who oversaw the creation of new free schools and academies in an effort to provide greater choice and competition.

Mrs Morgan also revealed she would not stand in the way of grammar schools expanding to take in new pupils.

She said: 'It is very much about what parents want, whether they want a free school, whether they want to send their children to academies or grammar schools. 

'If grammar schools want to expand, we’re not going to stand in their way.'

Overall she said: 'There will certainly be no soft-pedalling on reforms.

'I think Michael has been a fantastic education secretary and the reforms he has put in place, particularly freeing schools from Whitehall interference, have been phenomenally successful.'

She rejected calls to perform a U-turn on rules to punish parents who take their children out of class during term time, saying the policy 'sends a firm signal'.

Mrs Morgan also backed the policy of allowing lessons to be taught by people without formal teaching qualifications: 'If (heads) say that the best person to teach economics is somebody who has worked in a bank in the City of London, then fine.'

Michael Gove was hated by many teachers over his radical reforms to school pay, the curriculum and exam standards

The Education Secretary also supported Mr Gove's policy of allowing new free schools to be opened where there is demand, even if there is no shortage of school places in the area.

'If there is parental demand for free schools, that's where they should go,' she said.

'It is very much about what parents want, whether they want a free school, whether they want to send their children to academies or grammar schools.'

She said the Department for Education would not stand in the way of grammar schools that want to expand.

Mrs Morgan, who went to the private Surbiton High School, has a six-year-old son, Alex, who attends a state school. Asked if he would go to a state secondary school, she said: 'We've got very good state secondary schools, so yes, but he's a long way off secondary school.'
