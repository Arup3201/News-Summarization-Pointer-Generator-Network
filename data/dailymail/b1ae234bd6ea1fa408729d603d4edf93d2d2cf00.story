A woman who thought she had a pain in her side died just four days after doctors told her she had ovarian cancer.

Previously fit and healthy, customer services adviser Rachelle Beckett first felt the pain while she was on holiday in Rhodes with her partner Stephen Sinclair in May.

The 43-year-old was treating it with Paracetamol on returning to the UK then went to see her GP who sent her to hospital for checks.

Just five days later she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer which doctors found had spread to her liver, lungs and stomach.

She was not well enough to undergo chemotherapy and Miss Beckett, from Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire died at Barnsley Hospital four days afterwards on June 27.

Dr Patricia Foster, director of clinical director of oncology at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said ovarian cancer symptoms can be difficult to recognise.

She said: 'There are early symptoms to look out for such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach and difficulty eating.

'It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age.'

Her mother Lesley Olsson and her stepfather Kris praised their daughter's bravery.

Mrs Olsson said: 'Rachelle was a very private person and kept her pain to herself. I don't think anyone realised it was as bad as it was.

'She had time off work and was taking Paracetamol for the pain in her side. We kept asking the nurses at hospital what if we'd come sooner but they said her symptoms were not severe enough to point to what it was.

'She was so incredibly brave. She never cried or asked "why me?" she was just resigned to it.

'The day before she died I was alone with her in her room and she had the most wonderful smile on her face. She said: "It's quite exciting. I'm going on an adventure." That's what her attitude was like.'

Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year.

It is the fifth most common cancer among women.

It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age.

The symptoms are difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease, as they can be very similar to those of other, less serious, conditions.

The most common early symptoms are persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating and nausea.

Other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently.

 said the care her daughter received at hospital was 'second to none' 
and they are now raising money for Cancer Research UK.

Miss Beckett worked for a car firm and she holidayed in Greece twice a year and was interested in cooking and socialising.

She loved the band Pulp and their hit 'Common People' was the first song to be played at her funeral.

She always wore red lipstick and all the women who went to her funeral wore the lipstick in her memory.

Her mother said: 'She was the victim of a nasty, insidious disease which spread through her body rapidly and took her life on the day she was going to be transferred to a local hospice.

'We are left trying to make some sort of sense of what has happened and searching for the reasons why?

'She had her life before her, things to do and places to see. She was only 43 and was taken from us in just nine days.

'We feel cheated but also privileged to have had her in our lives. She endured her illness with an inner strength which we found humbling.'
