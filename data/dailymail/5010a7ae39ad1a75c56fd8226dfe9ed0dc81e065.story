An RAF Harrier jump jet that was once used by the RAF in the Falklands is being advertised for sale on a second-hand car website.

The 1976 Hawker Harrier GR3 has also been used by the RAF in Germany and Belize but was last flown in 1990.

The plane has spent the past 22 years in a heated building at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire where it was used for instructional purposes.

An aviation firm bought the jet late last year and is now selling it on Pistonheads - a website and forum for car enthusiasts.

The Harrier is said to be in such good condition that Chris Wilson, who is selling the plane, believes it could easily fly again.

Mr Wilson, a former Red Arrows engineer, is the boss of Jet Art Aviation in North Yorkshire.

'In my opinion this is the cleanest first generation RAF Harrier you will get. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity,' he said.

'This aircraft has been preserved incredibly well having never been kept outside. The condition is so good in fact that there is serious potential for a future return to flight project,' he added.

Cost: Chris Wilson spent £60,000 on parts, £500 on paint and £10,000 removing the plane from RAF Cranwell

Mr Wilson said that ideally the plane will be preserved, adding 'it would be nice if was bought by someone and loaned to a museum so the public could enjoy it.'

He bought the Harrier from the MOD in 1990 as a 'surplus aircraft in an unrestored state'.

He then spent £60,000 on parts, £500 on paint, £10,000 removing it from RAF Cranwell and 600 man hours working on it.

The result is an amazing aircraft 
which comes with the correct Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine, although is not
 currently fitted to the aircraft.

It is described as 'externally complete' while the interior has the original ejection seat installed.

The plane, which flew combat air 
patrols in the Ascension Islands in 1982, was also used in the Falklands
 during 1983 as part of air defence.

Power: The Harrier GR3 is a 47 foot long jet with a 25 foot wingspan. With a Pegasus engine, it develops a staggering 21,800lb of thrust

It is being sold with a mass of documentation and paperwork dating back to when it was first flown in 1976.

Harriers are one of history’s most iconic aircrafts. They were first introduced in 1969 and were used by the RAF until 2010.

The fighter jet, famous for its ability to vertically take off, was capable of 731mph.

Mr Wilson said he wouldn’t like to go into what he expected the plane to sell for, but it is thought to be a six-figure sum.

'It is the best RAF GR3 Harrier you will buy. The Harrier is the best of British and everyone knows what it is,' he said.

'We don’t know how much it is worth so we’re inviting offers. It is worth what someone is willing to pay for it,' he added.

Famous for their ability to 
take-off and land vertically, Hawker Siddeley Harrier fighter jets were 
introduced on April Fool's Day 1969.

Despite being 46 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet, the plane only has room for a single pilot on-board.

The Hawker Harrier GR3 model has a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus 103 turbofan engine capable of speeds of up to 730mph.

The
 plane has a combat radius of 230 miles - which means it can travel on 
missions several hours from its base without having to return for fuel.

It is able to travel for 2,129 miles between two fixed locations when not laden with guns or missiles.

The plane also has the ability to climb to 40,000 feet in just two minutes and 23 seconds.

In
 terms of weaponry, the GR3 is equipped with two 30mm 1.18 inch ADEN 
cannon pods within the fuselage and can carry a variety of unguided iron
 bombs.

It also has 
four weapon stations under its wings and one under the fuselage, with 4 
Matra rocket pods with 18× SNEB 68 mm rockets and two AIM-9 Sidewinders 
air-to-air missiles.

In the Falklands War in 1982, 10 Harrier GR.3s of No. 1 Squadron operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes.

As
 the RAF Harrier GR.3 had not been designed for naval service, the 10 
aircraft had to be rapidly modified prior to the departure of the task 
force.

Harriers were decommissioned by the RAF in 2011, to be replaced by the Joint Strike Fighter by the end of the decade.

Axing
 the Harrier is thought to have saved the Ministry of Defence about 
£900million, and has reportedly led the loss of around 12,000 jobs in 
the Harrier force.
