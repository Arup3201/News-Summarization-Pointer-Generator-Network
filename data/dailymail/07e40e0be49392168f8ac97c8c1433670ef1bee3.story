A surfer has been airlifted to hospital after being attacked and bitten by a Great White Shark off the coast of California.

Kevin Swanson of Morro Bay was on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park which is 200 miles north of Los Angeles when he was bitten by the 10ft animal.

It had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, dug teeth into his hip and then dragged him under the water.

Mr Swanson was submerged for a several seconds, a witness told The Tribune, before managing to resurface.

He then yelled 'shark attack' and frantically paddled back to the shore with the rest of the group.

Andrew Walsh, who was surfing with Mr Swanson at the time, said when he reached the beach managed to create a tourniquet for his leg using the leash on his surfboard. 

He told the paper: 'It was really radical. I was about 10 feet from him, and it was absolutely quiet. … (The shark) came straight up out of the depths and got him and took him under the water. That was the amazing part: this big giant side of the shark just curving up out of the water.

'Two doctors who happened to be walking along the beach at the time ran over to help before more medical assistance arrived. 

Mr Walsh added: We're really blessed that he was still able to get himself to shore. I was a few feet behind him, and we grabbed him and got him out of the water, obviously, up on the sand, and very quickly these doctors where there, helping out and calling 911.'

He was then airlifted to the Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo with lacerations to his hip.

Officials at the hospital said he was in a 'fair' condition as of 3pm Pacific Time.

The authorities did not close the beach as a result of the attack, but instead sent out notifications to others in the area.
