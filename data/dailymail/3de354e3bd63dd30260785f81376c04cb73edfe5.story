In smart homes, all appliances and devices from fridges to TVs will be controlled using smartphones.

But while this sounds great in theory, simple actions like turning on a light bulb could take longer using a phone than simply flipping a switch.

Now, inventors in Tel Aviv, Israel, have come up with a smart light bulb adapter that can be controlled with simple voice commands, saving people precious time and energy.

Bright idea: Inventors in Tel Aviv, Israel, have come up with a smart light bulb adapter called Vocca (pictured) that can be controlled with simple voice commands, saving people precious time and energy

Fits: All standard light fittings

Technology inside: Voice recognition technology from Sensory Inc and TobyRich Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Low Energy app design

Voice command: 'Go Vocca light' but the Vocca Pro can be customised

Installation: None

Compatibility: Several Voccas can be controlled and pre-set using an iPhone app

Cost: From $39 (£23) plus shipping

Launch: Estimated for December 2014

Writing on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, the makers said: ‘Who wants to pull out their smartphone to control lighting? Vocca is focused on real life use rather than being cool for a week.'

The Vocca bulb adapter is a prototype but will be able to be installed by anyone when it launches in December.

Its creators claim that unlike other smart devices, the device does not rely on Wi-Fi or a hub and needs no configuration.

They say it will make it possible for people to switch on the light from anywhere in a house, simply by shouting the command, ‘go Vocca light’.

The adapter will use voice recognition technology and using a Bluetooth app, will always be on and listening for words to respond to.

Once a trigger phrase is uttered, the device will transfer the powers from the mains to the light bulb.

The adapter is designed to fit different light bulbs and fittings. Consumers can still use a regular light switch with the device if a voice command isn’t convenient.

A ‘Pro’ version of the adapter is also available to pre-order, which will allow people to create their own voice commands to turn their light on and off.

Customisable: A 'Pro' version of the adapter is also available to pre-order, which will allow people to create their own triggers to turn their light on and off. Using an accompanying iPhone app, (pictured) they will also be able to set the gadget to automatically switch on at a certain time

Using an accompanying iPhone app, they will also be able to set the gadget to automatically switch on at a certain time to wait someone up and switch off for bedtime.

Users will be able to control all the Voccas from their phone remotely. 

The device is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for $39 (£23) plus $12 (£7) shipping outside US, while a Pro version costs $49 (£29) plus shipping per device.

The company is half way to raising the $40,000 (£24,000) it needs to manufacture the device, which is expected to ship in December.

Time saver: Simple actions like turning on a light bulb could take longer using a smartphone in a smart house than simply flipping a switch. The voice command device is said to be six times faster than turning a light off by using a smartphone
