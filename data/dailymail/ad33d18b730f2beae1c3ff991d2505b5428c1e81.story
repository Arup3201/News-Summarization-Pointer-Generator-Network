Thrashing around in the water clutching a large fish between his teeth, this striking image of a brown bear catching its lunch stunningly captures both the beauty and ferocious power of the natural world.

The sockeye salmon tries to put up a fight but is no match for the bear with a splash of the fish's blood standing out from the water as the giant sinks its teeth in.

Italian photographer Valter Bernardeschi's beautiful shot taken in the waters of Lake Kuril Kamchactka in Russia is one of 100 pictures set to go on display as part of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2013 award at the Natural History Museum in London.

Incredible: A brown bear emerges from the waters of Lake Kuril Kamchactka - Russia after having caught a large salmon. This stunning image was taken by Italian photographer Valter Bernardeschi

Stunning: Taken by American Douglas Seifert, this image shows a dugong mingling with snorkelers in a shallow Egyptian bay where he feeds upon seagrass

Back to nature: Alejandro Prieto from Mexico has called this shot of a predatory crocodile preying on a green turtle in Costa Rica

An exhibition of the finalists from this year's prestigious competition is to go on display next month, with judges releasing just a handful of the magnificent images that were entered this year as a sneak preview.

Now in its 49th year, the competition, ran by the museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine has this year attracted a staggering 43,000 entries from both amateur and professional photographers from 96 countries around the world.

As well as Mr Bernardeschi's effort, the exhibition will also feature American photographer Douglas Seifert's snapshot of a Dugong mingling with snorkelers in an Egyptian bay as he feeds on seagrass.

Just seven of the creatures remain on a 62 mile stretch of coastline and Douglas watched with fascination as the Dugong was harassed by snorklers until it eventually fled into the depths of the sea.

Alejandro Prieto saw his shot of a crocodile preying on a green turtle in Costa Rica commended by judges.

Commended: Etienne Francey noticed this tiny mouse snacking in the fields near his village in Switzerland

Up close: This stunning shot of lions getting a soaking in the rain at the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, was taken by American Michael Nichols

Co-existing: Primates and humans live alongside one another in this village in northern India in this image taken by Portuguese photographer Marcos Sobral

He had set out looking for bull sharks who he heard were circling near the beach. But instead he came across the predatory reptile and managed just one shot before it dragged the turtle off towards the sea.

Serene: Diana Webman took this picture of a gorilla and her twins in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park

He said: 'With a fast movement, the crocodile held the turtle by its flipper and then, with a flick of its jaws, grabbed the still-living reptile by its head.

'I willed the crocodile to be still for a moment, while I struggled to keep the camera steady.'

A more serene picture of nature was captured by Diana Webman in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park when she took a beautiful image of a gorilla feeding her two young twins.

The silverback leader of the group had just chased the mother and her babies from a nettle patch, and while the mother protested she eventually moved on.

‘In this picture, she is still tense from the encounter’, says Diana, ‘and continues to glance across at him while she eats. Her twins, in the comfort of their mother’s strong arms, appear blissfully ignorant.’

The twins’ future, though, remains uncertain. The mountain gorilla is officially listed as critically endangered.

Entries to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition are submitted in a variety of categories each year, with three categories aimed at photographers aged under 18.

Thousands of pictures are then judged by industry experts and the overall winner is announced at a ceremony at the Kensington museum in October.

A book of the commended entries is then released and the exhibition tours the world.

The competition has gone from strength to strength since it was introduced back in 1964 - then it attracted just 600 entries in three categories.

The last winner of the contest to hail from the UK was Ben Osborne who took the crown in 2007 with his image Elephant Creation.

Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen's image of bubble-jetting emperors won last year.

Tickets from the exhibition go on sale tomorrow with the pictures on show from October 18 until March 23.
