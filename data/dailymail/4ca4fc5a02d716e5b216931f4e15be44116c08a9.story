Rolf Harris was today linked to Jimmy Savile as it emerged he joined the paedophile on a sick visit to the psychiatric hospital where the DJ habitually abused patients.

One of Savile’s victims said Harris ogled vulnerable women as they undressed at Broadmoor in 1973, where the former Top of the Pops star attacked scores of people.

Alison Pink remembered the pair suddenly turning up on a women’s ward just as patients were preparing to strip in the corridor and said they were 'birds of a feather'.

It came as a video emerged today showing Harris and Savile laughing about how 'we go back a long time' in 1992.

The Australian then sketched Savile smoking a trademark cigar, which was sold for £4,500 at a charity auction after his death in 2012.

Reunion: The interview came almost 20 years after the pair visited Broadmoor together and where a Savile victim said they watched women strip for bed

Paedophile: Savile abused dozens of women at Broadmoor, where he also had his own set of keys and living quarters

The Broadmoor ex-patient, now called Steven George after a sex change, said: ‘Harris turned up one evening out of the blue.

‘He was being shown around by Savile in an understated way. Normally stars only came if they were there for an official performance but Harris didn’t do one.

‘It
 was also unusual because visitors would come at visiting hours, between
 10am and 4pm, but they came in as we were getting ready for bed.’

New pictures reveal that Harris and Savile also signed autographs for children who attended a fete in the grounds.

Almost two decades later the pair were reunited by ITV, who filmed them together for Harris' series Rolf's Cartoon Club. Harris had previously appeared on Savile's BBC show Jim'll Fix It.

Discussing their careers and how their paths crossed when Harris was a pop star and Savile was on Radio 1 and Top of the Pops they admitted: 'We go back a long time'.

Savile smokes a cigar with his tracksuit top unzipped and deliberately confuses Harris with Elvis Presley.

Rolf then unveils a sketch, which Savile holds and says: 'I see strong character lines, I see liquid brown eyes and I see the firm jutting chin, all together makes a horrible sight,' and Harris laughs as he says: 'It looks nothing like you.'

Twenty years later it was sold after he died in 2012 to raise money for his foundation, at an auction that raised £320,000.

Other lots included a glass eye stolen from a corpse, which he then made into a trophy necklace.

It is believed to have been worn by the paedophile DJ as he co-presented the final episode of Top of the Pops at BBC Television Centre in 2006, where he also groped a child.

'Birds
 of a feather': Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris, pictured appearing 
together on Jim'll Fix It, watched women in Broadmoor undress, according
 to a former patient

Documented: Harris's visit to the Berkshire hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week's report on Savile's abuse

Yesterday 
Harris, 84, was told he faced an 'inevitable' jail term after he was 
found guilty of 12 indecent assaults on four victims between 1968 and 
1986, often in 'plain sight'.

'Jekyll
 and Hyde' Harris had used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before 
abusing them with impunity and believed his celebrity status made him 
believe 'he was above the law', Scotland Yard said. 

The
 Australian star spent 16 years abusing his daughter Bindi's best friend
 and got a 'thrill' from attacking her when his own child was feet away.

A seven-year-old girl was groped when she asked for his autograph at an event where he performed his hit 'Two Little Boys' for children.

Account: A report into Savile's abuse said he had forced Broadmoor patients to strip

Today it emerged that Harris could face fresh charges after more women found the courage to come forward after he was convicted yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions said.

While 12 others have already approached lawyers to apply for compensation from his £11million estate.

His native Australia has also turned on Harris, where he was viewed as a national treasure.

The mayor of Perth in western Australia said the council was considering tearing up a plaque to Harris inlaid in the city's St Georges Terrace, while there is growing pressure for the disgraced entertainer to be stripped of his honours from the Queen.

Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news of the conviction, telling ABC radio: 'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people. Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime.

'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.'

He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday.

Harris’s visit to Broadmoor hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week’s report on Savile’s abuse.

But police and child protection experts found no evidence of wrongdoing by Harris.

The report said Savile forced patients to strip, it stated: ‘We heard convincing accounts of a pattern of inappropriate behaviour surrounding Savile’s attendance on female wards at bath time and bedtime... female patients would be obliged to strip while lined up in corridors.

‘We heard that Savile followed a clear pattern of arriving on a female ward at just before this time.

‘Unchallenged by staff, he would then watch from behind, as the row of female patients undressed.’

Mr George, now 62, first wrote an account of Harris’ Broadmoor visit in his 2012 autobiography 'Heartless'.

Guilty: Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court today after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault

Disgraced: In Australia a plaque laid in his home town near Perth has been defaced and may be pulled up while prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news Harris was convicted 

He was sent to the high-security psychiatric hospital as a teenager after running away from adoptive parents and setting fire to a property.

A woman who says she was abused by Rolf Harris wrote to Buckingham Palace to say: 'He ruined my life. You need to know what kind of man you’ve let near the Queen'.

The alleged victim said she was attacked by him as a child and was furious when she learned the artist, 84, was to paint Her Majesty in 2005.

The note, written anonymously, was handed to the Queen's Royal Protection Group, linked to Scotland Yard, who filed them as evidence.

It wasn't until 2012, when Harris was arrested, that they were investigated.

Scotland Yard has refused to comment.

Top of the Pops host Savile was a frequent volunteer and was given his own keys and living quarters at the hospital.

He recalled how Savile took Harris to Lancaster ward, where women who were being punished had to strip in the corridor in front of warders.

He told the Mirror: ‘Harris was very famous at the time and had his weekend show. He walked down the passageway of York ward with Savile opening the doors along with a nursing officer.

‘Some of the girls came out and there was an unprompted performance of Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He then went through to the punishment ward.

‘At that time of the evening all the girls on that ward would have been undressed ready for bed.

‘We all had to get completely undressed in the hallway in front of the staff, male and female, to show nothing was being taken into our rooms.

‘I thought it was odd that he was walking through the female wards and not doing a show. It was strange that he arrived at the same time the women were undressing for bed.’

Harris and Savile were pictured together as they signed autographs at a fete in July 1973.
