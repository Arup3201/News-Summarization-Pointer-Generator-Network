An elderly man has been charged with two murders after he allegedly beat a resident and carer to death with a hammer at his assisted-living complex.

David Settle, 68, was later found in the bathtub of his Las Vegas home wearing a diaper after a suicide attempt, authorities said.   

Henry Namett, 82, and 59-year-old employee Elenita Ablao were both killed after suffering more than 20 blows to the head on Sunday.

'Hammer attack': David Settle, 68, has been arrested over the murders of two residents at his assisted-living center in Las Vegas, Nevada

Police discovered the male victim in a recliner chair at an apartment and the female in a corner of the bedroom.

The motive for the attack was unclear as Settle had appeared to have a friendly relationship with both individuals.

A police report revealed that Settle was paranoid his landlord was cheating him out of money and stealing his belongings.

The war veteran also told Las Vegas police that he had gone to the store to buy wine and cigars after the attacks.

Settle's ex-wife Gina Harris told Lvrj.com that he was an alcoholic, battled drug addiction and used to beat her during their 17-year marriage. The couple have an adult son who lives in Los Angeles.

Ms Harris said that Settle had been in the air force in Vietnam and suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression. She said he had tried to commit suicide several times while they were married.

The 68-year-old is being held at Clark County Detention Center without bail.
