The door has been opened for Chelsea to sign Filipe Luis after Atletico Madrid had an offer close to £8million accepted for Guilherme Siqueira.

The Blues are looking to sign a left back to replace the departing Ashley Cole.

Luis was one of Diego Simeone's key players during Atletico's run to the Champions League final and their La Liga triumph.

Is that the way to Madrid? Guilherme Siqueira will be playing for Atletico next season after Granada accepted a bid of nearly £8m

Siqueira, on loan at Benfica last season from Granada, was also in fine form as the Portuguese giants reached the Europa League final.

Benfica had an option to purchase the defender themselves but decided not to pay, so Atletico swooped in.

Siqueria, 28, had been linked with a move to Real Madrid last summer.

The Brazilian is currently in his home country on holiday but will fly to Madrid in the next few days to seal the deal.

It means Chelsea can make their move for Luis, which could cost them up to £19.4m.

The end of an era: Ashley Cole will leave Stamford Bridge after eight sensational seasons

Luis, also 28, helped his side concede just 26 times in 38 matches as they won La Liga for the first time in almost two decades.

Cole had been sidelined by Jose Mourinho for much of last season with Cesar Azpilicueta, a right-back, playing out of position in his place.

With Luis now likely to move to Stamford Bridge, competition will heat up in Chelsea's defence.Branislav Ivanovic could move inside from right back to cover for David Luiz, who has signed for Paris Saint-Germain.
