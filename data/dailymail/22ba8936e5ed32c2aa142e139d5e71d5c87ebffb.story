In the wake of Gone Girl - Gillian Flynn's bestselling psychological thriller in which a man's wife disappears and all fingers point to him - many people are asking themselves the question: 'How well do I really know my partner?'

If you're stuck for an answer and need a bit of help, fear not: there's an app for that.

A legal firm has created an e-quiz for couples to take part in and discover whether they know all the intricate likes, dislikes, firsts and habits of their other halves.

The fun new app from Osbornes Solicitors mediation department will test how well you know each other

Osbornes Solicitors online survey, For Better Or Worse, contains 37 questions about you, your partner and your relationship, such as 'where did you have your first kiss', 'which meal do you cook best', 'who would play you in a movie of your life' and 'what do you think is your best feature'.

Once you've answered 10 questions, you submit your email address, your partner's email address and wait for them to give their answers. Theirs are then sent back to you for you to score.

The fun new app comes from the mediation department at law firm Osbornes Solicitors.

Partner Julian Beard said: 'The app offers couples, families and friends a light-hearted quiz to test how well they know one other.  You simply send your answers to them and wait for their reply - for better or worse.'
