Gateshead ended Warrington Town's FA Cup ambitions as goals from Matty Pattison and Danny Wright ensured the Conference side squeezed into the third round draw.

South African midfielder Pattison finished high into the net after eight minutes after Rob Ramshaw had got the better of Craig Robinson near the touchline and pulled the ball back.

But they needed a stoppage time second from Wright to overcome Warrington's spirited resistance. It was a moment to forget for goalkeeper Karl Wills, who tried to launch a late Warrington assault but saw his clearance fall straight to Wright, who finished into an empty net.

Despite the scoreline, this was far from comfortable for the hosts, who rank three divisions and 79 places above their Northern Premier League Division One North opponents.

Warrington were the toast of football romantics everywhere when they dumped League Two Exeter City out in the first round in front of the BBC cameras and they were backed by over 1,000 vocal travelling fans in the north-east.

Gateshead, looking to reach the third round for the first time since 1954-55, overcame a banana skin of their own in the first round when they won 4-0 at eighth-tier Norton United.

While Warrington benefited from Craig Robinson's early goal against Exeter, this time they fell behind in the opening stages when Pattison struck.

Indeed, they were holding on at times as first John Oster and then Alex Rodman were denied in quick succession. Defender Tom Hardwick blocked Oster's shot on the line, before Wills saved Rodman's low angled effort.

Gradually, the Wire fought their way into the game and striker Lee Gaskell attempted an audacious overhead kick inside the box that flew just wide of the post.

On 25 minutes, Oster saw another shot cleared off the line as Gateshead, who are in contention for the Conference play-off places once again, attacked down the right.

The Heed were getting plenty of joy down that flank and one such move saw Pattison send the ball wide at the near post.

The half-time interval saw a change of referee, with James Adcock suffering an injury and replaced by Richard Clark.

Warrington emerged the brighter and home goalkeeper Adam Bartlett had to touch away a left-wing cross from captain David Mannix as Lewis Field lurked.

Gateshead should have doubled their advantage on the hour but Pattison headed JJ O'Donnell's cross against the post.

And James McCarten was called upon to clear an Alex Rodman shot off the line as Warrington clung on, before substitute Wright saw his chip hit the post and bounce away to safety.

In the end, Wright's goal in the first minute of stoppage time killed off the contest but Warrington walked off with heads held high after their exceptional Cup run.

However it is Gateshead looking for a plum tie against one of the big boys in Monday night's third round draw.
