With less than two weeks until George Zimmerman goes on trial in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, has defense fund has been revealed to be almost depleted.

Zimmerman's attorneys posted on their website on Wednesday that the fund has less than $5,000 left. Back in January the fund had almost $315,000.

The attorneys say they calculate that Zimmerman needs another $120,000 to put on a good defense or even another $75,000 to give him a fighting chance.

Attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West say they haven't been paid a cent and many interns are working on the case without pay.

They say they will need the money in the coming weeks to pay experts and for transcripts of depositions.

It hasn't been a good week for Zimmerman's defense team. A judge ruled on Tuesday that they won't be able to mention Trayvon Martin's drug use, suspension from school and past fighting during opening statements in the trial.

Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused to allow jurors to travel to the shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay the trial set to begin June 10.

The judge called the request to let jurors see the crime scene 'a logistical nightmare.'

George Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old's killing and has pleaded not guilty, saying he acted in self-defense. He did not attend Tuesday's hearing.

The judge also ruled that some of the Martin's texts and other social media statements won't be allowed in opening statements, though some of the teen's personal history could be allowed later with a ruling from the judge depending on how the case progresses.

Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, had argued that text messages
 sent by the 17-year-old - in which he describes being 'angry' following
 a fight with another teen on the night he was fatally shot by Zimmerman - 
should be heard by a potential jury because it's 'relevant to [Martin's]
 emotional state,' and would strengthen the defense's claim that Martin 
was the aggressor in the struggle that ultimately took his life.

'He got mo hits cause in da 1st round,' Martin says in a November 2011 
text message, apparently in reference to a fight he'd been in prior to his run-in with Zimmerman.

'He had me on da ground nd I 
couldnâ€™t do ntn.'

Defense: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara, left, has told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he confronted Martin last year

With the photos and text messages, 
Zimmerman's attorneys hope to show that Martin wasn't the 'angel' he's 
been made out to be by his family, attorneys, and the media, but rather 
an experienced fighter who used drugs.

O'Mara also told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he confronted Martin last year at a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

'We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with the event,' O'Mara said. 'It could have affected his behavior.'

An attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said the teen's parents were pleased with the judge's rulings.

'Trayvon Martin is not on trial,' Crump said.

Zimmerman
 himself is no 'angel,' critics say, and the evidence his attorneys are 
hoping to have admitted could be an attempt to keep prosecutors from 
introducing some less-than-flattering details about his past, including 
an ex-fiance who filed an injunction order against Zimmerman following 
an altercation, and some disparaging comments about Mexicans found on 
Zimmerman's MySpace page.

'No angel': attorneys for alleged murderer George Zimmerman were denied a request for photos of Trayvon Martin smoking marijuana to be included as evidence in Zimmerman's murder trial

The judge ruled against a defense request that the pool of jury candidates be sequestered during jury selection.

She said jurors will be referred to by their jury numbers and prohibited their faces from being photographed.

Nelson denied a prosecution request for a gag order that would prohibit attorneys from talking about the case.

O'Mara said he is concerned potential jurors could be affected by publicity the case is receiving.

The
 defense attorney had asked to push back the trial date because he said 
prosecutors had delayed turning over evidence as required.

O'Mara is seeking sanctions against prosecutors, but a hearing on those sanctions was delayed until next week.

Self-defense: George Zimmerman claims that Trayvon Martin punched him repeatedly before he fatally shot him in February 2012

Before the judge decided to postpone the hearing on sanctions, a former prosecutor who used to work in the same office as the attorneys prosecuting Zimmerman testified he had told O'Mara about photos and text messages from Martin's cell phone that hadn't yet been turned over to the defense.

Former Assistant State Attorney Wesley White resigned last year from the State Attorney's Office that covers northeast Florida.

Zimmerman 
has been charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting Martin 
on February 26, 2012, after he followed the unarmed teen through a 
neighborhood park because he looked like he was 'up to no good.'

Zimmerman, a volunteer 
neighborhood watchman, claims he shot Martin in self-defense, and that 
the teen punched him repeatedly before Zimmerman decided to use lethal 
force.

The shooting of
 Martin, who is African-American, by Zimmerman, who is not, has fueled 
new debates about racial profiling, gun-control, and self-defense laws.
