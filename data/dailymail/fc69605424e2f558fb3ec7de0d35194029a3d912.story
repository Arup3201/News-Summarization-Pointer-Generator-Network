Two men have been arrested after a seven-year-old boy died after allegedly being beaten at his home.

Police were alerted just after 7pm on Saturday after schoolboy Blake Fowler was taken to hospital from an address in Cromarty Road, Shirley, Southampton, Hampshire.

He died the following day at Southampton General Hospital after suffering a serious head injury.

Blake's step-father Peter Meek, 23, was being questioned by police on suspicion of grievous bodily harm along with his brother Philip, 21, the Sun said.

The pair were looking after his fiancee Sarah Spacagna's three children while she was out.

Blake's family made the decision to turn of his life support machine on Sunday after doctors said he would never wake up, the newspaper added.

A Hampshire police spokeswoman told 
MailOnline: 'Police officers in Southampton are investigating the 
circumstances in which a seven-year-old boy from the city received a 
life threatening head injury from which he eventually died.

'Officers are continuing to investigate how the boy came to receive the injury, and as part of that investigation a 23-year-old man and a 21-year-old man, both from Shirley, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

'They have since been released on bail until March 6 while investigations continue.'
