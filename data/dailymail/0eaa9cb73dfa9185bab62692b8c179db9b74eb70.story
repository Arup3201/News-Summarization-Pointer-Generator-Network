It began with a little red book and a desire to ensure workers received fair reward for their labours.

Today, the business is the darling of conservative middle Britain and one of the few to survive the recession with its reputation enhanced.

John Lewis is celebrating its 150th anniversary and a unique business model that has worked well both for its customers and the employees, or ‘partners’, who own it.

In fact the company of today is a reflection of the ideals of Spedan Lewis, rather than his father John who founded the chain as a drapers shop in London’s Oxford Street in 1864.

Spedan was not some kind of Chairman Mao of the high street, but a gardener and naturalist troubled by the fact his family’s income was greater than the combined annual earnings of the entire workforce.

It was Spedan who gave up his ownership rights to the family business when his father died in the 1920s.

In what was a revolutionary approach, he handed it to the staff who would run it according to the rules he set out in what became known in the company as the ‘little red book’ which he saw as an alternative to Communism.

This book contained the constitution for the John Lewis Partnership, establishing the ownership rules and setting out a creed of courtesy and integrity that today’s managers are expected to carry on.

The little red book, which has been updated many times over the decades, offered a guide to staff on everything from the clothes they should wear to lift etiquette.

Partners were reminded that ‘they shall never enter or leave a lift or doorway in front of a customer’.

High pressure selling was absolutely forbidden, and there was a strict policy confirming that the customer is always right, threatening staff with disciplinary action if they reacted to those who were rude or unreasonable.

It was also Spedan who developed the ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy in 1925 which evolved into the price promise to match the lowest figure of rivals.

In film footage from the early 1960s Spedan, then in his seventies, talks about how he had ‘an idea for a better way of managing business, so that instead of the many being exploited by the few there would be genuine partnership for all, managers and managed alike, all pulling together for their common advantage’.

Waitrose, the favoured supermarket of the middle classes was acquired by the John Lewis partnership in 1937

Company archivist Judy Faraday said: ‘When he joined the business, the family were taking out £26,000 a year. The total wage bill for the 300 staff was about £16,000 and he thought that was grossly unfair.

‘At that time, there was lots of new thinking, we had the rise of the British Labour Party, Communism and the emancipation of women. He was really rebelling against the authoritarian views of his father.’

The template continues today with the 91,000 staff in its stores and Waitrose supermarkets sharing in the success of the £4billion-a-year business in the form of bonuses.

The company is marking its 150th anniversary with an exhibition at its Oxford Street store, where a roof garden will open for the summer.
