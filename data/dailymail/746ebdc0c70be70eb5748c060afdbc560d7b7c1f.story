An elderly man suffering from dementia died after he was locked out of a care home in the middle of the night.

Gerry Green, 83, who also had a heart condition, died in hospital shortly after he was seen trying to get back into the council-run Kenrick Centre, in Birmingham, at 4.30am.

Birmingham City Council has ordered an independent investigation into the case following a complaint by the pensioner's son, Steve Green.

'Neglected': Gerry Green, who suffered from dementia, died after he was locked out of a care home in the middle of the night

Complaint: Steve Green (left), holding a photograph of his father, believes that staff neglected the vulnerable elderly man (right), who was seen trying to get back into the care home at 4.30am

Mr Green, 52, believes that staff at the home neglected his father, and wants to know how he was able to wander outside on his own.

Mr Green usually looked after his father himself at home, but he arranged for the pensioner to stay at the Kendrick Centre for two weeks while he went on holiday.

On April 2 this year, CCTV footage showed the elderly man trying to get back into the home after wandering out.

Staff found him in the grounds after the alarms went off, and took him to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he died.

An investigation began in April, but Mr Green said he was still awaiting answers.

Devoted: Gerry Green, pictured as a child (left), was married to his wife Ida (right) for 50 years. She died in 2004

He said: 'If he was found in my back 
garden in the middle of the night, I'm sure somebody would have had me 
in court or social services would want to know what the hell I was 
playing at.

'To be outside is total neglect. There should be no way a person with dementia can get out of a building.

'It's
 a disgusting state of affairs. I'm absolutely shocked by it and to 
think that I had faith in them to care for my dad is awful.'

Mr Green, of Bartley Green, West Midlands, said his father had gone for a walk along a corridor at the home and got out through a fire door.'

Relaxing: Gerry and Ida Green enjoy a day out. Their only son, Steve, has demanded answers after Gerry died shortly after being locked out of a care home

Concerns: Steve Green said the death of his father Gerry (right), pictured with wife Ida (left), was 'a disgusting state of affairs'

He added: 'The alarms went off and they said they found him quickly.

'But why didn't they just get him back to bed before he went outside? He'd have been back to sleep in ten minutes.

Alarm: Staff found Gerry Green, with his wife Ida, in the grounds of the care home and took him to hospital, where he died

'If he'd died in his bed that's fair enough, that's life. But not outside, like a tramp.

'I was told Dad was seen on CCTV walking up and down two to three times trying to get back in.

'By the time they found him he was probably almost dead.'

Mr Green also alleges that care home staff failed to give his father his medication, including a sleeping tablet, on the day he died.

'Having a heart condition it must have been a shock for him being locked out at 4.30 in the morning,' Mr Green added.

'I don't think he would be dead now if it wasn't for that.'

Mr Green cared for his father after his mother Ida died from a heart attack in 2004, aged 78.

The couple were married for 50 years and Mr Green was their only child.

A spokesman for the council said: 'We wish to express sympathy with Mr Green's family.

'Upon receiving the complaint we spoke to Mr Green and agreed to commission an independent investigator to look into the case.

'The investigation is currently ongoing so it would be inappropriate to make any further comment.'
