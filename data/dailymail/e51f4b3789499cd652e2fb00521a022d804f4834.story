England's 1966 World Cup winner and former Manchester United player Nobby Stiles is suffering from cancer.

The 71-year-old is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, but doctors expect he has a chance of making a full recovery.

The father-of -three's illness was confirmed by his son John, according to the Sunday Mirror.

The ex-defensive midfielder was on a routine visit to his GP when he received the news.

John said: 'Thankfully it was diagnosed early and the outlook is extremely positive.'

Footballers sent their support to the star, who is famous for dancing with his false teeth in his hands after the famous win at Wembley.

Football pundit and formal Celtic player and Welsh international, who suffered from testicular and brain cancer four years ago, said he had no doubt the England legend could beat the illness, saying he can reproduce the strength of character from his playing career.

Mike Summerbee, an ex-England and Manchester City player who has overcome the same illness, said it was encouraging that it had been diagnosed early.

He added: 'I know from personal experience how you can come through this and I am sure Nobby will do the same.'

Stiles, who was inducted into the 
English Football Hall of Fame in 2007, has continued to give 
after-dinner speeches around the country despite his cancer treatment.

In
a 15-year career, he made 414 appearances for Manchester United, 
Middlesbrough and Preston North End and made 28 caps for his country 
before retiring in 1985.

He 
then went on to manage three teams, including the final club he played 
for Preston, as well as the Canadian team Vancouver Whitechiefs and West
Bromwich Albion.

Stiles
finally returned to Old Trafford in 1989 to coach the youth team, where
he mentored the likes of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.

However the highlight of his career came when England beat West Germany 4-2 in extra time to win the World Cup in 1966.

Twenty years ago, his teammate Bobby Moore passed away after suffering from Bowel Cancer.
