A priest was arrested after he was caught carrying a gun in his back pocket and a bag of marijuana in his hoodie while driving under the influence, police say.

University of Alaska Fairbanks parish priest Father Sean P. Thomson, 52, was stopped after police spotted him speeding and weaving across the road.

The Catholic priest, who police described as disoriented when he was stopped, handed over a receipt when asked for his vehicle registration.

A criminal complaint filed against Thomson claimed he alerted police to a .357 caliber handgun in the back of the pickup truck, but he did not mention a 9mm handgun in his back pocket, according to the Fairbank Daily News Miner.

Trooper Christopher Bitz also wrote in the report the priest had a bag with a small amount of marijuana in his hoodie sweatshirt.

A preliminary breath test revealed Thomson was three times over one legal standard, but Bitz said the priest refused to take a more accurate test at the Healy trooper post because he 'said he was drunk and did not feel the test was necessary'.

Thomson was charged with DUI, refusal to take a chemical alcohol test and drugs misconduct.

Thomson is due to appear at the Rabinowitz Courthouse (pictured), in Fairbanks, on Friday

He
 was also charged with two weapons offences - possessing a firearm while
 intoxicated and failing to immediately inform troopers he was carrying a
 firearm.

Thomson pleaded not guilty to the charges at an initial court hearing and was released on $5,000 bail.

He is due to appear at the Rabinowitz Courthouse, in Fairbanks, on Friday.
