Her husband earns a seven-figure salary as a Premier League footballer.

But Sunderland defender Wes Brown's wife Leanne is still counting the pennies - as she proved during a recent trip to Legoland.

Leanne, 36, who visited the Windsor-based resort with her husband and daughters Halle, Lilia and Lola, collected tokens from cereal packets to gain free entry.

'A bargain': The mother of three collected tokens from cereal packets to gain free entry. She wrote on Twitter:  'We made sure we stopped off at tesco and bought 3 boxes of cereal to get the buy one get one free offer'

The blonde mother of three wrote on Twitter:  'We made sure we stopped off at tesco and bought 3 boxes of cereal to get the buy one get one free offer legoland saving £138! A bargain.'

Kellogg's is giving away two-for-one vouchers - offering one free adult entry for every adult or child ticket purchased - to several Merlin theme parks this summer, including Legoland and Alton Towers.

By using the tokens, Leanne and her 34-year-old husband, who live in Cheshire, paid around £140 for six people, including a friend, to enter the resort, instead of £280.

But despite their savings, Leanne was not impressed with the queue, rides, food nor the price at the theme park, which features 55 rides, shows, workshops and other attractions.

A long wait: But despite their savings, Leanne was not impressed with the queue, rides, food nor the price at the theme park. Earlier in the day, she tweeted: 'Wow biggest que in the world at LegoLand! hope it's worth it'

Earlier in the day, she tweeted: 'Wow biggest que in the world at LegoLand! hope it's worth it (sic)', but later added: 'Value for money it is not!'.

She then took to her blog, writing: 'Legoland was not so great. Having never been there before, I was quite looking forward to it but was shocked to find out the price of entry per person.

'Luckily my friend Zoe remembered there 
was a buy one get one free offer on cereal boxes, so we stopped off at Tesco
 to buy three boxes of frosties and saved ourselves £138.

'[This was] well worth it as 
when we actually got inside, we ended up spending an extra £120 on the 
equivalent to fast passes to bypass the queues…shocking but necessary!

'The rides were dated and there wasn’t much to raise the heartbeat (to be honest, even my seven-year-old wasn't impressed).

'They [also] ran out of hotdogs. Unfortunately we will not be going again.'

Wes, who married Leanne in 2009, owns a five-bedroomed mansion in Prestbury, Cheshire, complete with a decadent cinema room, a vast spiral staircase, a leisure complex and a sound-proofed music studio.

In 2010, he put the property up for sale for £4.5million, but was later forced cut the price by £1million after failing to sell it for several years.

The couple's visit to Legoland this week was part of a 'family trip' to Windsor, Berkshire, before the ex-Manchester United player settles down for the Premier League season.

Wes joined the Manchester United youth team in 1996, before becoming a regular first team player in the 1998-99 season, during which he was part of the club's treble-winning side.

From 2000 to 2008, he won numerous honours, including four Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a League Cup and another Champions League. 

He earned his first England cap in 1999, before being selected to play at the 2002 World Cup.

He retired from international football in August 2010, but joined Sunderland on a four-year deal in July 2011.

The club, nicknamed the 'Black Cats' and managed by Gus Poyet, recently enjoyed a pre-season tour in Portugal where they enjoyed mixed success.

They will kick off their season away at West Brom, a fixture they lost 3-0 last season.

Speaking of Leanne's purchase of its promotional packets of cereal, a Kellogg's spokesman said: 'Our fantastic value on pack offers such as Merlin are for all of our loyal consumers to enjoy whatever their bank balance.

'At the end of the day millionaire or not, everyone loves a bargain.'

Meanwhile, a Legoland spokesman said: 'We are, of course, always disappointed if any of our visitors do not 100 per cent enjoy their day with us.

'We are, however, a little at a loss to understand these comments given Mrs Brown took advantage of our fantastic Kelloggs offer – giving her and her whole family a wonderful full day out together for significantly less than say the average hour long beauty treatment.'

'Legoland was not so great! Having never been there before I was quite looking forward to it but was shocked to find out the price of entry per person.

'Luckily my friend Zoe remembered there was a buy one get one free offer on cereal boxes, so we stopped off at Tesco to buy 3 boxes of frosties and saved ourselves £138.

'Oh, and they ran out of hotdogs! Unfortunately we will not be going again. We would definitely have been much better off spending the day in and around the hotel and the countryside!'
