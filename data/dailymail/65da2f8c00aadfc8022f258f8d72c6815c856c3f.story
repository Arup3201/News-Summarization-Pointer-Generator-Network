Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan has revealed what goes through his mind while he's waiting for his opponent to finish at the table - and it's usually whether he will make it to dinner or not.

'The Rocket' is widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented players in history, although he has openly questioned his commitment to the sport during a career that has brought him five World Championship titles.

Speaking to Forever Sports magazine, the world No 2 explained how his dedication can be personally tested by slow players, especially if he's feeling hungry.

'In snooker if you're not at the table, you're sitting in the chair and there's nothing you can do. You can't get to your ball and talk to your caddy and say: ''he's playing a bit slow this f*****g idiot here'',' he said.

'In snooker you have to sit in your chair and watch some f*****g numpty poncing about. Do you know what I mean? You just think to yourself: come on mate. But there's nothing I can do! I can stand up and go: 'look, boom boom boom' but the ref will say: ''sit down Mr O'Sullivan, it's not your shot. Just chill out, man. Wait until he's finished.'' I'm thinking: finished? I wanna get some dinner in.

 'Oh s**t mate. They put me on an evening match and I've got some geezer poncing about, I think: I aint gonna get no dinner. Because of him! And I'm starving and I'm thinking: the restaurant shuts at half nine, ten. It's like quarter to nine now and we aint even at the interval. Come on mate.

'And then you think to yourself, come on, well, if you really want it that bad you can have it. Pffft! Good luck to you. But, no, I used to do that quite a lot but now I'm just like, come on, I'll get through this match and the next match won't be so bad.'

While waiting to play his next shot may cause O'Sullivan's mind to wander, the 39-year-old doesn't get as worried about making a mistake when he's at the table hunting a 147 maximum.

'I never worry about f*****g something up, because I know I'm gonna get a 147 eventually, whether I miss this frame or it's the next frame or the frame after. So I never think [makes panicky noise].

'If you've got one opportunity, and that's all you've got, then you're going to be under pressure; if you thought: this is my one and only chance to win a world title. But I've never thought like that. I've always thought, if I lose this one, I'm gonna win the next one.

'If I don't make the maximum here, there's one round the corner mate, I just know. So I never get under pressure. In fact I thrive on it. I weren't even gonna pot the black on one. I made 140 and thought, you know what: fuck you and your four grand highest break [prize]. You can have it. I aint even that bothered. 

'Do you know what I'm saying? Although I'm excited and there is adrenaline pumping through my body, I don't feel under pressure. I know that they just happen, and they will happen.' 

O'Sullivan is crowned UK snooker champion for the fifth time in his career in 2014

The eccentric 39-year-old claims he doesn't care if other people think he's 'bonkers' or not

O'Sullivan also responded to a question regarding excerpts from his autobiography Running, in which claimed people thought he was 'bonkers'.

However, O'Sullivan interrupted: 'I don't give a f**k if they think I'm bonkers mate, because if you listened to everyone who said you were bonkers, you wouldn't set foot out your f*****g house. So I just say to myself: great, you have your opinion, you do this. But I'm going down that road mate.'
