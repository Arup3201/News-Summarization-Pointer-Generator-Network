It's a condition that affects one in fifteen adults - and causes copious arguments - but you could be saying good night to snoring thanks to a new ring.

The Good Night Anti-Snoring Ring claims to be a natural non-invasive way of getting a great night's sleep for you and your partner.

The £29.99 piece of metal uses acupressure theory by applying pressure to specific points on your little finger.

Good night: 15 million people snore in the UK and a new £29.99 ring claims to be a natural non-invasive way of getting a great night's sleep for you and your partner

Acupressure treatments are said to promote the release of endorphins - natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.

The ring works by applying the basic principles of this Chinese practice which dates from 3,000BC.

It presses on a point either on the side or the base of the little finger between the knuckle and joint - SI2 (Small intestine 2) & HT9 (Heart Meridian 9) - to enable a better flow of energy to these parts of the body.

Can it end your sleeping woes? The £29.99 piece of metal uses acupressure theory by applying pressure to specific points on your little finger

How it works: Worn on your little finger every night for 30 minutes before you sleep and until you wake, it presses on a point either on the side or the base of the little finger between the knuckle and joint

The pressure creates a positive stimulus of the central nervous system and it is claimed that this helps the throat and larynx muscles, reduces sinus swelling and drains the nasal cavities - reducing nasal congestion.

The ring helped 85 per cent of snorers who trialled it.

There are an estimated 15 million snorers in the UK and from nasal spray to expensive surgery, there is a huge market for gadgets that claim to beat snoring.

Restless: Bed partners of snorers report they have just 3-5 hours sleep per night

Snoring
 is no longer an ‘old person’s problem’. In part, this is because two of
 the biggest factors that induce snoring are weight and alcohol.

This
 kind of snoring is different from sleep apnoea, a serious medical 
condition where the airway narrows or closes altogether so that in 
extreme cases the patient stops breathing for several seconds. 

There are 15 million snorers in the UK. 10.5 million men and 4.5 million womenThe three main reasons for snoring are: being overweight, smoking and drinking alcoholSnoring sound is air turbulance vibrating the structures in the ‘upper airway’.Snoring sounds range from 50dB to 100dB - the equivalent to a pneumatic drill.Snorers are three times more likely to suffer adverse health conditions than non-snorers.Snoring can be hereditary - nearly 70 per cent of snorers have a familial link.Bed partners of snorers report they have just 3-5 hours sleep per night.
