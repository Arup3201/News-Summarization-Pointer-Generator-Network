It's an issue that's rarely spoken about, but groundbreaking new research has revealed alarming statistics concerning intentional self-harm  among young Australians.

Children as young as three are deliberately harming themselves, with 8,227 admitted to hospital in the past five years for self-harm related injuries, the Children's Rights Report 2014 shows.

The alarming report, which comes from The Children's Commissioner, also shows five Australian children aged between four to 11 have died from intentional self-harm in the past five years.

The Children's Commissioner Megan Mitchell said she was prompted to compile the report because there was a pronounced lack of data on self harm for these age groups.

'I really focused on children under 18 in this study to find out what's happening and find out how to support them better,' she told SBS.

'What that is telling me is that we need to be getting in much earlier in working with children to build their resilience; identifying risk factors and encouraging help seeking,' 

The study revealed some marked differences between genders, with boys are far more likely than girls to commit suicide than girls.

Boys are also significantly less likely to seek help when experiencing hardships, however they are more likely to speak with someone over the phone, rather than the internet.

The report showed were over 18,000 hospitalisations in Australia for self-harm among people aged between three and 17, with 82 per cent of these cases resulting from self-poisoning.

'We really need to mount that really strong research agenda in order to intervene at the right time and provide the right supports to kids that we know will work for them,' Ms Mitchell said.

She has called for more detailed surveillance of self-harm and suicide among the age groups in the study.
