While most Americans celebrate Thanksgiving by gorging on turkeys in the company of their relatives, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr has a different take on tradition.

The five-division world champion posted one of his typically egotistical videos on Instagram, this time featuring himself receiving a bathtub massage... to somehow commemorate the Pilgrim Fathers' harvest festival.

Soft classical music plays in the background as the undefeated champion is given a back rub by a well proportioned young lady, accompanied by the caption: '#HAPPYTHANKSGIVING'.

Meanwhile, Manny Pacquiao has once again called out the pound-for-pound king to put his undefeated record on the line and fight him.

Mayweather reacted to the Filipino's recent dominant points win against Chris Algieri by taunting him with an Instagram video showing Pacquiao being knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez when the pair fought back in 2012.

The WBO welterweight champion responded by saying: 'He should step up and fight me since I am easy to knock out.

'The fans deserve that fight. I think it's time to step up and say yes.'
