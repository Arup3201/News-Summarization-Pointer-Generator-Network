Binge-drinkers too paralytic to look after themselves should be thrown into ‘drunk tanks’ that would cost them more than a room at The Ritz, police chiefs argued today.

To tackle Britain's soaring levels of alcohol-fuelled disorder the intoxicated would be forced to pay a fine and £400 for the security and medical staff needed to care for them overnight.

Putting drunks into privately-run cells to sober up would allow police to do other work and stop them 'clogging up' accident and emergency departments, senior officers say.

It came as a survey of 2,000 police today found that 95 per cent believed too much of their time was taken up dealing with the inebriated.

What people face: This is the inside of an Australian drunk tank, with its metal bed and loo, which could be used in Britain

In need of help: Police say they are sick of drunks causing problems and 'clogging up' A&E so want to take action

Time consuming: A large proportion of police and NHS work on Friday and Saturday nights is taken up by the paralytic

These drunk tanks, already used in the 
United States, Australia and parts of Europe, would be privately run, 
and those put in one would be handed a bill when they left the next 
morning.

Chief Constable Adrian Lee is 
leading a campaign to highlight the harmful effects of alcohol.

ACPO lead: Chief Constable Adrian Lee of Northamptonshire argued: 'Why don't we take them to a cell owned by a commercial company and get the company to look after them until they are sober?'

He said the
police and NHS should not be responsible for youths who ‘choose to go 
out and get so drunk that they cannot look after themselves’.

The Northamptonshire Police chief argued: ‘Why don’t we take them to a cell owned by a commercial company and get the company to look after them until they are sober? 

‘When that is over we will issue them with a fixed penalty, and the company will be able to charge them for their care, which would be at quite significant cost – and that might be a significant deterrent.’

Drunk tanks were recently backed by Matthew Grove, the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner.

He said in an interview with the trade journal Police Professional: ‘It is quite difficult to work out where the best place to put a drunk is. Is it a police station, or do they need to be at a hospital?

‘A&E departments are under huge pressure, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.

‘Why should we have drunks clogging up A&E, causing further problems potentially?

‘Why not put them somewhere safe where you could have private medical staff on hand?’  

Problem with alcohol: A man is left in a German drunk tank, which could be used in Britain and users could be charged £400 per night

Already in use: Shoes lie abandoned outside a drunk tank at a police station in Paris

Around 50 per cent of all violent crime is alcohol related.

Official figures show that offenders are under the influence of alcohol or drunk in nearly half of all incidents of domestic abuse.

Alcohol also plays a part in up to a third of child abuse cases.

Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne said today: 'I welcome this campaign to raise awareness of the impact of alcohol-fuelled crime, which costs around £11 billion a year in England and Wales.

'Frontline police officers are all too aware of the drunken behaviour and alcohol-fuelled disorder that can effectively turn towns and cities into no-go areas for law-abiding people, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.'

Mr Lee also criticised the Government for failing to do enough to tackle binge-drinking, after ministers dropped plans for a minimum price for units of alcohol, and Labour's 24 hour drinking laws.

The Government shelved the plans in July amid fears the change would hit responsible drinkers.

'I think the cafe culture was an entirely legitimate experiment but I don't think it has worked.

'The impact on the streets of our towns now at three and six o'clock in the morning is very significant and I don't think that is correct and we need to change that.

'But there are lots of positive things that are happening. I think the minimum unit price hasn't gone, we'll think about it again.'

A survey of more than 2,000 police officers conducted by ITV's Daybreak found 95 per cent believe too much time is spent on dealing with drunk individuals.

Some 95 per cent also believed fewer crimes would be committed if less alcohol was consumed, while 74 per cenmt of the officers surveyed also said not enough is being done to tackle cheap alcohol.

Tony Lloyd, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Greater Manchester and chairman of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said some PCCs are looking at 'drunk tanks', which house inebriated people overnight and allow police officers to deal with other crimes.

He said: 'Binge drinking blights towns and cities across England and Wales.

'Police and Crime Commissioners are working to change the culture by working with positive role models such as street pastors who engage with drinkers and offer support to change their ways.

'Some Commissioners are looking at 
'drunk tanks' which house inebriated people overnight and allow police 
officers to deal with other crimes.'

Matthew Grove, the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner, asked 'why should we have drunks clogging up A&E, causing further problems potentially?'

Diana Johnson MP, Labour's shadow crime and security minister, said: 'We will look at the proposals from Acpo closely as we should always be open to effective new ideas.

'There should, however, be caution about the role of the private sector after our recent experience with G4S and others, who would see this as another money-making opportunity.

'Drunk Tanks though could and should only be one small aspect of any proper alcohol strategy, which would need to start with education in schools right through to licensing enforcement powers.

'The Government's alcohol policy is out of touch and in disarray - dropping their minimum alcohol pricing policy, rejecting drugs and alcohol education in schools, and going ahead with an ineffective 'late night levy'.'

A week-long campaign has been launched by police forces highlighting the difficulties faced by those dealing with drunkenness and alcohol-related incidents.

The Alcohol Harm initiative will see forces out on the streets with mobile custody suites and medical triage facilities to deal with the drunk and disorderly.

Neighbourhood policing teams, special constables, police cadets and volunteers such as street pastors will be deployed in drinking hotspots.

And police will be addressing new students at freshers' weeks on staying safe and providing awareness training on vulnerability with security and bar staff.

Police chiefs says nearly 50 per cent of all violent crime and domestic abuse is alcohol-related.
