David Cameron left the Liberal Democrats reeling yesterday as a provocative carve-up of his Cabinet signalled a shift to the Right on law and order, the environment and Europe.

Right-winger Chris Grayling was appointed to Justice as veteran Kenneth Clarke, dubbed the 'sixth Liberal Cabinet minister in the Coalition', was demoted.

Owen Paterson, who has dismissed wind farms as a waste of money, became Environment Secretary.

In the biggest shock, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt was promoted to Health as Andrew Lansley paid the price for controversy over the Government's NHS reforms.

Both Lib Dem and Tory MPs who oppose a third runway at Heathrow, along with Boris Johnson, expressed alarm as Transport Secretary Justine Greening, an implacable opponent of expansion of the airport, was brutally sidelined and moved to International Development.

She was replaced after just ten months in the job by Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, who was said to have 'no baggage' over aviation.

In another shock for the Lib Dems, arch-Thatcherite Michael Fallon, who has been a member of the Prime Minister's inner circle as Conservative deputy chairman, and Chancellor George Osborne's close ally Matthew Hancock were both sent to the Business Department as 'counterweights' to Business Secretary Vince Cable.

Mr Osborne, who was booed by spectators at the Paralympics on Monday night, was also seen to have been bruised by the reshuffle as former Chancellor Clarke was compensated for his demotion with a roaming brief – which will focus in part on the economy.

And a proposed switch to Justice for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, mooted by Mr Osborne's allies after the two men clashed over plans to cut more from the welfare budget, failed to come off.

In an embarrassing blow to the Prime Minister's authority, Mr Duncan Smith flatly turned down the move.

In what was dubbed a 'morning of the blunt knives', Mr Cameron dispatched only three members of his Cabinet altogether: Commons Leader Sir George Young, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman and Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan, who was said to have been in tears as she was sacked. The big beasts of the Government – Mr Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May – kept their jobs.

But aides insisted the Prime Minister had cleared away what he regarded as 'roadblocks' as the Government entered an 'implementation phase'.

Asked about the negative Lib Dem reaction to several of his appointments, one Tory source asked: 'Who cares?'

In other moves:

■
 Fallen Lib Dem star David Laws, who resigned from the Cabinet days into
 the Coalition over his expenses claims, returned as Education Minister;

■
 Disability Minister Maria Miller was the biggest female winner, 
propelled into the Cabinet as Culture Secretary and Equalities Minister;

■ Housing Minister Grant Shapps was made Party Chairman as Tory MPs got their wish and Baroness Warsi was sacked and demoted;

■
 Tory MP Nick Boles, who has described opponents of planning reform as 
'hysterical, scaremongering Luddites', is to be made Planning Minister;

■
 A clutch of new women MPs, including Anna Soubry, Helen Grant, Liz 
Truss and Esther McVey, won junior ministerial jobs to compensate for an
 embarrassing fall in the number of full women Cabinet members. Lib Dem 
MPs expressed deep unease at the Cabinet's shift to the Right – with Mr 
Grayling's appointment causing particular dismay.

The former shadow home secretary takes a far tougher stance on law and order than Mr Clarke, and as one of the Government's staunchest Eurosceptics is likely to pick a fight with Strasbourg over prisoners' votes and human rights law.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said: 'The one Cabinet appointment which Liberal Democrats will look at most carefully is that of Chris Grayling.

It often seems that Ken Clarke was speaking for the Lib Dems as much as the Government both in Parliament and outside.'

An aide to Nick Clegg insisted he was 
content with the changes – though he admitted Mr Cable had not been 
consulted about the appointments to his department.

Tory MP Peter Bone said it appeared 'a more Conservative government than we had before ... I think the party will be delighted.'

In
 other changes, Transport Minister Theresa Villiers became Northern 
Ireland Secretary and David Jones was appointed Welsh Secretary.

Jeremy Hunt was the biggest winner in the reshuffle as he took charge of the NHS despite controversy over his links with Rupert Murdoch's media empire and controversial views on health.

His promotion marks a spectacular turnaround in his political fortunes and could revive his ambitions to succeed Mr Cameron as Tory leader.

A clearly delighted Mr Hunt said the appointment was the 'biggest honour' of his life.Paying the price for months of controversy last year over his reforms of the Health Service, Andrew Lansley was axed in an unexpected move by David Cameron.

Though he had previously suggested he
 would not take any other government job, having been in charge of 
health policy for the Tories since 2004, the Health Secretary accepted a
 demotion to the job of Leader of the Commons.

Culture
 Secretary Mr Hunt was handed the post only a few months after his 
career was seen to be hanging by a thread over his contacts with Murdoch
 executives at time when he was considering the BSkyB takeover bid.

London 2012 Olympic chief Paul Deighton was given a key Treasury job in one of the biggest surprises of the reshuffle.

The former investment banker with Goldman Sachs has been appointed Commercial Secretary with responsibility for economic delivery and will take a seat in the Lords.

Mr Deighton, 56, will officially take up the role in January when his contact with London 2012 ends and he will be doing the job unpaid.

A move to Health had been mooted before the controversy erupted, but was thought to have been killed off as the Government awaits the verdict of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards, at which Mr Hunt received a tough grilling.

Liberal Democrats refused to back him in a Commons vote called by Labour on his future, in an episode regarded by Mr Cameron as a low point for Coalition relations. But despite the cloud hanging over Mr Hunt as Lord Leveson prepares his report, the PM is understood to believe he has 'been through the mill' and emerged stronger.

The appointment comes despite potentially controversial views Mr Hunt holds on homeopathy and abortion. In 2007, he signed an Commons motion backing the work of homeopathic hospitals. He voted to reduce the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks in 2008.

And he co-authored a book with Tory MEP Daniel Hannan which suggested the NHS might need to be 'dismantled' and claimed it was no longer 'relevant'.
