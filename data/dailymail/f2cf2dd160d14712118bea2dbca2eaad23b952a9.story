With blonde hair to her waist, four-year-old Evie-Leigh Austin loved pretending to be Rapunzel.

But when she found out that there were little girls with cancer who had no hair at all, she insisted having hers cut off and turned into wigs so they ‘could feel like princesses too’.

She has donated 14 inches of her golden locks, which was mixed with other hair to make wigs, and has raised enough money to buy three more for sick children.

Her mother Sarah-May, 26, told her about how cancer can cause hair loss when Evie-Leigh’s grandfather Baron, 67, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

She explained: ‘I said there were boys and girls who don’t have any hair because they are poorly. She loves her hair and was quite upset when she realised there were little girls who don’t have any hair at all.

‘She was adamant she was having it cut. She said she wanted to make the poorly girls smile and feel like a princess like she does.

‘I didn’t want her to have it cut because I love her hair, but her dad and I agreed that if she wanted to do it for charity she should. When it came to the haircut, she wasn’t bothered, but I was nearly crying. But now I think it suits her. She looks a lot more grown up.

‘She’s done a lovely thing and we are very proud. For her age, what she is doing is amazing.

‘She is a selfless little girl who wants to make the world a better place.’

Her mother said having short hair has not stopped Evie-Leigh from feeling like a princess and her favourite film is Tangled, the Disney version of the Rapunzel story

Evie-Leigh, from Burnley, also decided to raise £350 – the cost of a wig – for the Little Princess Trust, which provides them to child cancer patients. But she has already tripled her target and has raised more than £1,100.

Mrs Austin said having short hair has not stopped Evie-Leigh from feeling like a princess.

Her favourite film is Tangled, the Disney version of the Rapunzel story, in which Rapunzel has her hair cut to save the man she loves.

Mrs Austin added: ‘When Evie-Leigh watches it she says, “That happened to me”. She still thinks she is Rapunzel.’
