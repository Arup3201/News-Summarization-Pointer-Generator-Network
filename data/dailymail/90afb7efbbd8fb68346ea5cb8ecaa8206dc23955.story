Since Spain's King Juan Carlos abdicated his throne, all eyes have been on the country's most glamorous new Queen - Letizia.

The
 41-year-old, who is married to Prince Felipe, has earned her spot as 
one of the world's most stylish royals thanks to her impeccable wardrobe choices - and she's even managed to knock the once favoured Duchess of Cambridge from her top spot.

And it's not just in the sartorial stakes that Queen Letizia is reigning. One gem hunter says that while both brunettes are fashion icons who hail from a middle-class background, the similarities end when it comes to the biggest indulgence of royal life - jewellery.

Spot the difference: A gem expert says that the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Queen Letizia's jewellery reveals that their choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two

Kings and queens have always showcased their status with the help of a jewel or two. Steve Bennett, gem hunter and founder of The Genuine Gemstone Company, believes our modern royals should continue this tradition.

Casting his expert eye over Kate and Letizia’s sparkly accessories, Steve reveals that their jewellery choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two.

He said: 'As stunning women who can afford to inject colour into her jewellery, Letizia confidently embraces vibrancy and variety, whereas Kate is rarely without her conventional pearls or diamonds.

'In fact, the Spanish royal family combine colour and drama in a way that seems alien to the more conservative Kate.

Simple versus extravagant: The Duchess is looking very much the English Rose, assuming a more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart, right, who lets her jewels take centre stage

'An outsider would be forgiven for mistaking Kate as the princess enduring Spain’s current economic crisis - the absence of a statement necklace is more credit crunch than royal lunch. Rival Letizia shows us how to pair a tiara with vibrant magenta gems in the true style of a queen.'

Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana.

The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500.

When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings.

She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery which she snapped up from Made 
In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website, which she wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the
 South Pacific.

Wearing it with confidence: He believes that Queen Letizia wears her jewellery with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a journalist and her smile is as gleaming as her emeralds and showcases Spanish vitality to the world

Queen Letizia, however, is hardly 
ever spotted without her Cartier diamond bracelet, which can cost in 
excess of £25,000, as well as her favourite Bulgari Parentesi ring, 
which can cost around £10,000.

Steve goes on to explain that Letizia
 lets her jewels take centre stage whilst Kate is keen not to shock, 
adding that Letizia’s fashion forward choice of gemstones in daring 
shades, worn with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a
 journalist, is a 'breath of fresh air'.

The
 Duchess, meanwhile, is very much the English Rose, assuming a 
more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart, he says.

Cheap and chic: Amber Atherton and her team were thrilled to discover that Kate was a keen supporter of British jewellery

The collection: Kate bought the £86 Double Leaf Earrings and £420 Spread Your Wings Bracelets and a Conch Cuff from Zoraida on Amber's website

'As both royals adopt a fairy-tale princess guise, the most important match in Spain vs. England history has a clear winner.

'Kate’s 
most decadent display to date captures the zeitgeist of the British 
monarchy, and underlines her position as a queen in waiting. Yet, she 
misses her opportunity to truly assume her role as the modern day 
princess, plumping for colourless, conservative diamonds instead of 
adding a pop of colour to her outfit.

'Letizia’s smile, however, is as gleaming as her emeralds and showcases Spanish vitality to the world.

'Though
 our adoration for the Duchess remains unchallenged, it would seem that 
she could learn a thing or two from this budding Queen who boldly 
embraces the trappings of royal life.'
