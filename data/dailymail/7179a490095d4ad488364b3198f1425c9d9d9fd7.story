Chelsea legend Frank Lampard could line up against his former team-mates this weekend as Jose Mourinho's side travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on Premier League champions Manchester City this weekend. 

Lampard joined rivals Manchester City on a short-term loan deal after deciding to join New York City Football. Sportsmail have spoken to the likes of Mourinho and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to find out whether they think Lampard will be cheered or jeered this weekend.

Jose Mourinho

He made a decision and we respect that. I cannot wish him good while he’s playing for a direct rival, especially when he’s playing against us, but he will always be one of my favourite ever players. 

Even a few months ago, when he signed for the New York team, I was not expecting this. But it was his decision.

For me, it spoils nothing. I still believe what this club proposed to him, which is to come back when he wants. These were the words from Mr Abramovich and this is not in any danger. It is just a period of his career. He decided to play for City. His place in Chelsea’s history is untouchable.

He will always have a special place in the club. As a midfielder, to pass strikers like Kerry Dixon and Bobby Tambling to become the top scorer is unbelievable. 

Like everyone I was surprised when he signed for Man City, but Frank is not the type to do nothing for five months if there’s a chance to be involved. 

Chelsea have supporters who appreciate players who stay for a long time and do a good job. That’s really important. Instead of being acrimonious about departures, the club enjoy the time they were there.

Ron Harris

(795 games for Chelsea, 1961-80)

He’s been a terrific servant but some of the fans I talk to were very disappointed. Not that he left but that he signed on loan for Manchester City just a few weeks after saying he’d never play for another Premier League club. 

That stuck in their minds. Maybe the pounds, shillings and pence came into it, I don’t know. He’s a terrific lad, always goes out of his way to say hello. 

When I left Chelsea it was to be player-coach at Brentford. I played in a pre-season game against Chelsea and I got a good reception but I never said I wouldn’t play for another club. That’s the difference.

Roberto di Matteo

(175 Chelsea games and Champions League-winning manager in 2012)

Frank has been the best midfield player in the world in the past decade. His consistency and attitude in delivering top performances year after year is an inspiration for any professional football player. 

An easy player to work with because of his professionalism and intelligence. As a person he is an honest guy with good principles and integrity.

Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink

(69 goals in 136 games for Chelsea, 2000-04)

I don’t think it changes a lot for the Chelsea fans. If Frank had been offered a contract he would have stayed. A lot of the fans understand that.

I was treated really well when I played against them. It was refreshing. I know City is a rival for the title and it’s different to me, with Charlton and Middlesbrough, but I think he’ll get a good reception.

I hope and expect Frank will be treated with the respect he deserves. I would be amazed if he is booed. He is an absolute legend of the club and I believe he’ll receive a similar ovation to Didier Drogba when he returned with Galatasaray. 

OK, I would have preferred him not to join City but it’s a new phase in his career, linked with his move to New York, and we all have to respect that. If he had joined Spurs it might be a different story...

Alec Stewart believes Lampard should be given a similar level of ovation as what Didier Drogba received when he faced Chelsea in the Champions League

Dave Johnstone

(Spokesman for cfcuk fanzine)

My all-time favourite Chelsea player and probably always will be, because of his human qualities as well as his football qualities. 

No way is he a traitor. We slipped up by letting him go. He would have been an inspiration for the young players at Cobham and a fantastic ally for Jose Mourinho.

I think there’s a good chance the Chelsea fans will sing his name at the Etihad Stadium. I hope so.
