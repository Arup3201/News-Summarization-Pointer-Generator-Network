Tomas Berdych advanced to the semi-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters for the third time on Friday after opponent Milos Raonic retired with a foot injury.

Raonic called a trainer after dropping serve for the second time to trail 5-2 in the first. 

Following a short discussion with the doctor, who had a close look at his strapped right foot, the big-serving Canadian went to see Berdych on the other side of the court to inform him of his decision to give up.
