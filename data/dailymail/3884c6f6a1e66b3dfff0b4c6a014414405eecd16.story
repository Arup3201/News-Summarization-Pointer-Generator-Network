When most people reach the ripe old age of 85 they are enjoying a sedate retirement.

But burleque dancer Tempest Storm has no intention of hanging up her nipple tassles for the quiet life.

The pensioner, who claims to have had flings with Elvis 'the Pelvis' Presley and President JFK during more than 60 years as a performer, still pulls in a huge crowd every time she strips off.

Still going strong: Burlesque dancer, Tempest Storm, 85, hasn't hung up her G-string just yet and still pulls in a huge crowd every time she strips off

Youthful: At 85 years of age Tempest Storm says she has no intention of quitting the burlesque scene

Tempest, born Annie Blanche Banks, shot 
to fame thanks to her sizeable 44DD assets which helped her forge a 
successful career as a strip-tease dancer and saw her labelled the 'girl
 with the great front'.

And her 'moneymakers', as she called them, were insured by Lloyds of London for a seven-figure sum and dubbed the 'biggest props in Hollywood'.

But Tempest still takes to the stage to entertain her adoring fans who flock to see the 'Queen of Burlesque'.

Romance: Tempest Storm had a fling with the King himself Elvis 'the Pelvis' Presley, who she is pictured with

At her peak: Tempest Storm shot to stardom in the 1950s after leaving her home town of Eastman, Georgia, and heading to the bright lights of Los Angeles to begin her career as a burlesque dancer

Tempest said: 'I never went to 
Hollywood with dreams of taking my clothes off, but burlesque is 
something that just came naturally to me.

'You
 have got to have the right personality, and create a good rapport with 
your audience. You just can't teach someone that - and I just had it.

'You need to be sexy and tease the 
audience, make them believe that they are a part of your life at that 
time. And they are, I absolutely adore them, they're wonderful.

'I've
 been around more than 60 years and had the longest career of anyone in 
the business, it has been amazing. There's nothing I haven't done, I've 
been through it all.

Accidents: Tempest recently fell on stage which left her too frightened to perform her old acrobatic routines

'I just
 love performing. I still work the stage and tease the audience wearing 
sexy outfits and taking off my gown. And they still love it, they adore 
me.'

The veteran vixen also 
revealed that she dated Elvis 'the Pelvis' Presley, had a fling with 
former US President John F Kennedy and lived next door to her close friend Marilyn 
Monroe.

Seductress: Tempest Storm, 85, had flings with high profile celebrities during her career

Tempest added: 'I was mixing in high 
circles and a lot of big names would come and watch my shows. That is 
how I met "Elvis the Pelvis".

'I
 was performing at The Dunes - now the Bellagio - and Elvis came back 
stage to have photos taken with the performer, but I was in a hurry as I
 had friends coming to visit from Texas.

'I
 was stood there with Elvis Presley and I just said "will this take 
long?" I was standing next to the King and complaining about being in a 
hurry.

'He looked at me with
 those beautiful eyes and said "may I join you?" He was a real Southern 
gentleman - it was absolutely fantastic.

'And Kennedy, he was a very charming man. He was a great man in everything he did.

'I
 feel very honoured to have known so many amazing people and to have had
 those relationships. I am truly blessed to have personally known their 
greatness.

'I have beautiful memories of my time with them.'

Tempest shot to fame in the 1950's 
after escaping from her home in small town Eastman, Georgia, and heading
 to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming a star.

The mother-of-one said: 'I had a rough childhood so I left home as soon as I could, I was 14 years old.

'I knew I wanted to be a star so I worked my way up to California.

'But
 I didn't want to be just a flash in the pan. I told myself that if I 
was going to make it, I was going to be a big star. I had a lot of 
drive. I wanted to be the best.

'I
 got my break as a friend of mine knew a well known choreographer, 
Lillian Hunt, and set up a meeting with her in downtown Los Angeles. I 
got a job in the chorus line and I did that for a couple of months.

Memories: Tempest Storm has mixed with the rich and famous, including President JFK and Elvis Presley, during her six decades as a burlesque dancer

Dedication: Tempest Storm says she enjoys stripping as much today as she did 60 years ago

'After that Lillian took me under her 
wing and taught me Burlesque and I started performing in shows. The guys
 used to say I had the "biggest props in Hollywood".'

Three
 years ago Tempest had a fall on stage leaving her too frightened to 
perform her old routines, but it hasn't stopped her flaunting her famous
 curves in front of a crowd.

But
 the Las Vegas legend is still a slave to her trade and hosts her Las 
Vegas Revue show which is available for private bookings, as well as 
writing an autobiography, filming a documentary and a recorded interview
 on vinyl with The White Stripes' Jack White.

And
 the idol, who aspires to have her own reality TV show, still commands a
 huge following from aspiring Burlesque artists and flocks of devoted 
fans.

It's very touching. I'm thrilled that these girls see me as an inspiration.
