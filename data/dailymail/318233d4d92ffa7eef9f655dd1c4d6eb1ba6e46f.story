Whether they are leaping off a cliff, dangling over a ravine or scything through a cranberry field at breakneck speed, these daredevils all have one thing in common... they are happy to put their lives on the line in the name of fun.

This eye-watering collection of photographs shows just how far the world's most committed adrenaline junkies are prepared to go in their hunt for the ultimate thrill.

Taken in a host of exotic locations across the globe, the pictures not only offer an insight into the outer limits of human endeavour, but also provide tantalising snapshots of some the planet's most beautiful locations.

They include bouldering in the Indian Himalayas, Surfing in California, highlining in the Austrian Dolomites, ice caving in Argentina and BASE jumping in Utah.

They are part of Red Bull’s Illume 
photo contest, designed to honour photographers who love nothing more 
than to put themselves in harms way to get the most exhilarating and 
extreme action shots.

'A 
lot of the photographers are going to just as extreme lengths as the 
athletes,' says Tarquin Cooper, a spokesperson for Red Bull Illume. 
'They’re putting themselves in positions where you’re like, "How can you
even think about taking a picture?"'

All
together, 6,417 photographers from 124 countries submitted 28,257 
photographs to the 2013 competition. From that, an international team of
50 judges shortlisted 250 photos, and then picked 50 winners in 10 
different categories plus an overall winner.
