A law student has shocked her friends and colleagues by revealing her secret double life.

Helen Derbyshire, 22, form  Llansamlet, Swansea said her classmates were taken aback when she unveiled her incredible bikini body.

Helen, a trainee lawyer, was crowned Miss Bikini Wales after sticking to a strict protein-rich diet of chicken and fish and training each day before lectures.

Helen picked up the title of Miss Bikini Wales while studying for a law degree

To keep her muscular body in peak condition Helen eats seven healthy, protein-enriched meals a day which she prepares every night for herself.

As well as her Miss Bikini title, Helen gained a law degree from Edge Hill University in Lancashire - but says she felt just as focused on her body building as her studies.

'I have studied criminology and law for four years and I also have a huge passion for competing for the bikini body titles.'

She says that she didn't brag about her title while she was at university as people tended to make presumptions.  

Helen says that she kept her bodybuilding under wraps as people used to assume that she was stupid

'People have this assumption that you have no brains but I like to develop all of my assets - mental and physical.

'I kept it under wraps. It must have been a shock when people found out that I wasn't bookish all the time.'

Helen says that her title often makes people confuse her with a beauty queen.

'I am a bikini athlete which means I need a well-balanced physique.'

'When you mention bikini bodybuilding people often think it's a beauty pageant but it definitely isn't beautiful what we put ourselves through.' 

In order to keep in shape Helen sticks to a strict, protein-rich diet, which includes lots of fish and chicken

Helen says she and her partner Neil get through 10kgs of chicken, 5kg of mince and 2.5kg of fish each week

Helen says that despite her busy schedule she still found time to practice her hobby and gain a degree.

'It is very hard to juggle a degree too. But I wake up every day at 6am and do my cardio and then work on my degree from about 9am until 5pm.'

Helen's current partner, Neil, has held the title of Mr Wales for the past three years

Helen's interest in physical training has even crossed over into her personal life - her partner is Neil Andrews, the current Mr Wales. 

Neil, 34, has held the title for three consecutive years and now the couple are preparing to compete for the British titles at the bikini and bodybuilding championships in Nottingham on October 11 and 12.

Neil also partakes in Helen's strict eating regime and the young graduate says that their healthy appetite sees them make their way through copious amounts of meat. 

'Every week we get through more than 10 kilos of chicken, five kilos of mince and two and a half kilos of fish.

Helen now runs her own nutrition business from her home in Swansea, Wales 

'It's a lifestyle that we are proud of and work hard at.'

Helen has since turned her hobby into a career  as she now runs a nutrition business from home in Llansamlet, Swansea. 

Helen says that Neil, who now works as a steelworker, was an integral part in achieving her dream.

'Neil supported me through my degree which was a huge help when I was struggling to manage my time.

'He is proud of my physical and academic achievements.'

Neil says that he couldn't be happier for his girlfriend Helen. 

'We are confident we are doing the right things to perform at our best. I'm very proud of what Helen has achieved.'
