Woody Allen has been mired in controversy for the past year, following daughter Dylan's accusations that he molested her when she was  7 years old.

Now the filmmaker is being hit with even more allegations of misconduct from one of his former leading ladies. 

Mariel Hemingway was just 16 years old when she starred as Allen's teenage girlfriend in the controversial romantic-comedy 'Manhattan'.

May-December: In her new memoir, Mariel Hemingway says Woody Allen asked her to go to Paris with her after filming 'Manhattan' in 1979. She was just 16 years old when the film was shot - to Allen's 43. Above, a still from the film in which Hemingway plays Allen's schoolgirl romance

While the film was considered scandalous at the time, Hemingway has never spoken out against the director and last year even attended the Golden Globes to honor his lifetime achievement award. 

However, in her new memoir 'Out Came the Sun', she says Allen showed romantic interest in her which made her uncomfortable, according to FOX News. 

After wrapping filming on the 1979 movie, Hemingway says then 43-year-old Allen flew out to her parent's home in Idaho for a visit, during which he asked her to go to Paris with him. 

'Our relationship was platonic, but I started to see that he had a kind of crush on me, though I dismissed it as the kind of thing that seemed to happen any time middle-aged men got around young women,' Hemingway writes. 

Independent: Hemingway, the granddaughter to literary legend Ernest Hemingway, says she refused Allen's offer when she realized they would not be staying in separate rooms 

The teenage granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway told her parents that she 'didn't know what the arrangement was going to be' and 'wasn't sure' if she was going to have her own room. 

'Woody hadn't said that. He hadn't even hinted it,' Hemingway remembers. 'But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn't. They kept lightly encouraging me.' 

Hemingway recalls waking up in the middle of the night 'with the certain knowledge that I was an idiot'. 

She then went to Allen's guest room, shook him awake and asked: 'I'm not going to get my room am I?' 

Controversial: In 1980, Allen started dating Mia Farrow, another leading lady. The couple broke up in 1992 when Farrow found nude pictures of her then 20-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn in Allen's possession. Allen and Soon-Yi married in 1997 and remain together (pictured above last July) 

While he fumbled to put on his glasses, Hemingway made up her mind before he could even respond. 

'I can't go to Paris with you,' she said. 

The next morning, Allen ordered a private jet and left the family's ranch. 

The following year, Allen started dating another one of his actresses - Mia Farrow.

The couple stayed together until 1992, when Farrow found nude pictures of her then 20-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn in Allen's possession.

Allen married Soon-Yi five years later and they remain together, with two daughters.

In February 2014, Allen's estranged daughter Dylan wrote a scathing essay in the New York Times, claiming he sexually abused her in an attic when she was a child, sometime after his separation from her mother. Allen has fiercely denied the claims.
