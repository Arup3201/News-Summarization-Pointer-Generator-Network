Yohan Cabaye may have swapped the North East for Paris but the Frenchman still plays with his old side Newcastle United on Football Manager - and Hatem Ben Arfa is a key member of his team.

The PSG midfielder, who is currently away with the France squad ahead of the World Cup, tweeted a photo of himself watching Gael Monfils take on Andy Murray at the French Open while playing on the computer game.

And the 27-year-old made some interesting choices in his team selection, with the mercurial Ben Arfa featuring in a prominent number 10 role in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

The winger was sidelined by Newcastle manager Alan Pardew towards the end of last season and looks set to leave St James' Park but Cabaye clearly rates his fellow Frenchman.

Speaking to Foot Mercato, Cabaye said of Ben Arfa: 'I have not talked to him (about a departure).

'This is a situation that he must manage on his side. For me, he remains an extraordinary player with enormous quality.

'It
 is true that it was harder for him late in the season. He is going to 
bounce back and find more opportunities with another team.

'For me, this is one of the players I've played with who has the highest quality.

'If he decides to return home, that will be good for the French league.'

The only signing Cabaye appears to have 
made is 19-year-old Galatasaray winger Bruma, who features alongside Ben
 Arfa and Yohan Gouffran behind lone striker Loic Remy.

Best friend Mathieu Debuchy, captain Fabricio Coloccini and midfielder Vurnon Anita started as well.

Cabaye also selected his fellow countymen Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Massadio Haidara, who have been unable to nail down starting place under Pardew, goalkeeper Rob Elliot and fringe player Gael Bigirimana.
