Louis van Gaal has admitted Real Madrid target David de Gea could leave Manchester United — but the Old Trafford boss will fight to keep him.

Earlier this month, Van Gaal said the talented goalkeeper would soon extend his contract. But ahead of Saturday's visit of Leicester City, he admitted for the first time that may not be the case.

‘In football, everything is possible,’ Van Gaal said, when asked if he was concerned the European champions could pounce. ‘We want to keep him.’

Madrid-born De Gea, who has been in fine form for United, has 17 months left on his contract.

If the 24-year-old, signed for £18.9million from Atletico Madrid in 2011, does not sign a new deal Real could land him for nothing at the end of next season — something United fans, and no doubt the club’s board, are desperate to avoid.

De Gea’s agent Jorge Mendes recently said: ‘He’s a United player and has a contract there. You have to respect that but things change every five minutes.’

Van Gaal has been dealt another blow with the news that holding midfielder Michael Carrick will be out for a month with a calf injury.

The 33-year-old, who has also played at centre half this season, is the latest in a long line of injury victims. ‘I think it will take more than four weeks,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s not a minor injury. A muscle rupture, I think.’

Despite the loss of Carrick and Darren Fletcher, who is set to join West Ham, Van Gaal will not strengthen his squad in this transfer window.

‘We won’t be signing anyone,’ he said. ‘I’ve read every day that we are interested in players but I’m not interested in players.’

One man who could be following Fletcher out of the club is Brazilian midfielder Anderson.

He is in talks with Internacional, in his homeland, and Van Gaal admitted a move was ‘possible’. It would end a miserable time at Old Trafford for Anderson, who moved from Porto in 2007.

One new arrival was announced on Friday, as right back Sadiq El Fitouri joined from Salford City. The 20-year-old, previously on Manchester City’s books, was handed a chance by Paul Scholes and Phil Neville, who own stakes in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League club.

They recommended El Fitouri to United and, after impressing in training, club officials saw enough to offer him an 18-month deal.

Leicester’s last win at Old Trafford was in 1998 and United will look to improve a miserable record that has seen them score only 36 times in the Premier League this season.

Van Gaal acknowledged it was an issue. ‘I don’t think we are not attractive enough,’ he said.

‘But we have to score more goals.’

Meanwhile, United are increasingly confident they will land Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne — but not until the end of the season.
