Bloody, beautiful and brilliant, the God of War games rarely disappoint. And now Kratos is ready to return, in perhaps his last quest for vengeance on the PS3.

A single-player God of War: Ascension demo is available to download from the Playstation Network, focusing on the game's opening sequence.

Epic:Â  Revised graphics and combat means that this is shaping up to the best God of War game yet

It also lets you test out some of his new moves on the enemies you're likely to encounter during the campaign.

Sony has reportedly 'revamped' the combat and weapon systems and has tweaked Santa Monica's God of War 3 Engine to improve dynamic lighting effects.

The mini games have been revised, too. Some of the button prompts have been replaced with a more fluid free-form system and Kratos is now also able to pick up enemy weapons.

A Multiplayer element is said to feature, capable of catering for up to eight players. This sees two teams battling to take control of the map in order to receive gifts from the gods.The game is also the first in the series to support stereoscopic 3D.

Playstation Plus subscribers can also download the original God of War in HD for free from today.

Ascension is set for release on March 15, exclusively on the PS3.
