Legal battle: Former Broadmoor manager Stephen Rooney (pictured) is suing the top-security hospital for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal where it was claimed the Kempton Ward was being run like a social club

A hospital ward holding the most dangerous killers and rapists in Britain was run like a 'social club' with men giving one another back waxes on a pool table, an employment tribunal heard today.

While staff at the all-male Broadmoor top-security hospital watched television, at least one patient was enjoying a sexual relationship with a woman therapist, it was claimed, leading to another offender asking to be given an HIV test.

Details of the 'permissive' regime on the Kempton Ward - home to patients with Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) - were revealed at the employment tribunal where an ex-manager is suing for unfair dismissal.

Stephen Rooney launched his claim against the NHS trust governing Broadmoor after he was suspended for allegedly covering up details of the patient's request for the HIV test to reassure himself he was not at risk of AIDS.

Mr Rooney then resigned from the trust rather than take the new post, prompting his claim for unfair dismissal.

The 47-year-old former clinical nurse manager is claiming unfair dismissal against the West London Mental Health NHS Trust.

Mr Rooney alleges he lost his 
£40,000-a-year post in September 2011 following a disciplinary 
investigation into claims he withheld information about the patient 
apparently requesting an HIV test.

Giving evidence at the tribunal, Mr Rooney also criticised what he called a 'dysfunctional' communication at Broadmoor.

Among the patients being treated at Broadmoor are Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Stockwell Strangler Kenneth Erskine and cannibal killer Peter Bryan.

Referring to events on Kempton Ward, where Mr Rooney was based, Nadia Motraghi, representing the NHS trust, said: 'There was at least one occasion where a patient was waxing another's back while on the pool table.

'That's a very serious issue, isn't it?'

Mr Rooney replied: 'Yes it is.'

He told the tribunal the incident had occurred while he was on leave but he had learned of it upon his return.

'I managed to ascertain how this patient got the wax strips and who authorised it,' said Mr Rooney.

'It was being treated as a serious 
incident, a complete lack of boundary-keeping by staff. Unfortunately I 
was suspended during the midst of that.'

Mr Rooney said he had 'never' 
previously encountered a similar scenario and added: 'The wax strips 
apparently were bought as part of a patient raffle, from what I am led 
to believe post-suspension.'

Claims: The hearing was told that while staff watched television, at least one patient was enjoying a sexual relationship with a woman therapist, leading to another offender asking to be given an HIV test

Miss Motraghi told him: 'I'm going to 
suggest there was an overly permissive environment where rules were 
being relaxed to the point that patients were not subject to strict 
scrutiny and there was a blurring of the boundary between staff and 
patients.'

She went on to refer to an incident 
where Mr Rooney had described to a colleague witnessing members of his 
staff watching television for a long period during a shift.

'I was very, very hot on getting the 
staff to interact with the patients by getting them to understand why 
[it was important to do so],' said Mr Rooney.

'Going in there and barking at them to break out the board games doesn't work.'

Miss Motraghi also claimed staff would
regularly be heard swearing in the presence of patients, asking Mr 
Rooney: 'It contributes to a pub/social club type of atmosphere, doesn't
it?'

He replied: 'It could do, yes.'

Allegations: Mr Rooney claims he lost his £40,000-a-year post in September 2011 following a disciplinary investigation into claims he withheld information about a patient who apparently requested an HIV test

Mr Rooney joined the staff at 
top-security Broadmoor in October 1993, working initially as a nursing 
assistant and then a staff nurse before rising through the ranks to 
become a clinical nurse manager in 2007, working on the Kempton Ward as 
part of the DSPD service.

He was seconded to the position of 
senior clinical manager for seven months in late 2009, returning to his 
position on the ward at the end of May 2010.

The tribunal judge made an order that 
neither Patient 1 or Patient 2 should be named, along with the woman 
therapist, referred to as E1.

He told the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire: 'Shortly after [my] return to Kempton Ward, concerns were being raised regarding a patient's behaviour (Patient 1) towards a therapy assistant, E1.

'The team observed, discussed and planned strategies to address this behaviour and to support this member of staff.'

The tribunal heard Mr Rooney had trouble recalling events claiming he was suffering from extreme anxiety and stress at the time.

The hearing continues.
