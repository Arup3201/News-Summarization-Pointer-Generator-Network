Roman kicks off the video by cheekily suggesting he wants to do something to relieve his boredom.

"I think i am going to do something with the kids. I just dont want to sit here all day,' he tells his wife.

Soon afterwards his sons are seen getting excited as a huge ball pit is constructed in the living room on top of a trampoline.
