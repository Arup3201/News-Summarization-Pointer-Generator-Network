Tottenham cruised to victory in their Europa League Group C clash thanks to Harry Kane's hat-trick and a double from Erik Lamela. Sportsmail's Gerard Brand picks out the key points at White Hart Lane.

Europa League winners will reach the Champions League, but Mauricio Pochettino still mixes it up. He's made on average 8.4 changes for each European tie; last season they made 6.4.

The Argentine boss has made 42 changes in their five European games so far this term, but he hasn't necessarily picked weaker teams. 

On Thursday night he brought in Jan Vertonghen, Ben Davies, Emmanuel Adebayor, Andros Townsend, Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele after the 4-1 defeat to Manchester City, six players with 197 international caps between them.

Asteras are the Swansea City of Greece. Why? Rising through their national system at the same blistering pace, they won the fourth division in 2005, the same year Swans were promoted to League One.

Spurs marked the 10th anniversary of Bill Nicholson's passing with a commemorative programme celebrating the legendary manager's life. A memento for fans of that era, and the kids who gained entry for a fiver (£1.50 more than the programme.)

Despite the reduced prices (£25 adults, £5 juniors), there were plenty of empty seats at White Hart Lane. Strange considering each Europa League game is arguably more important to Spurs than their top flight encounters.

Turkish fans made some noise in north London recently, and despite the small Greek support, Asteras fans were typically boisterous, congregating to give their heroes an ovation 55 minutes before kick-off.

'Right now, the league table isn't crucial to us,' said Pochettino in his programme notes. Well, Mauricio, points make prizes, and Spurs haven't had this bad a start since Juande Ramos was sacked in 2008.

Bizarrely, Asteras had seven Argentinians in Thursday night's squad, all in that perfect age of 24 to 29. Wealthy owners Dimitrios Bakos and Ioannis Kaimenakis believe the key is South Americans at their peak, and who could blame them?
