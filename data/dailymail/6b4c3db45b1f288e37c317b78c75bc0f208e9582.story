On trial: Monika Antosik allegedly arranged for estate agent Alexander Kucharski, 86, from Warsaw, Poland, to be killed so she could steal his money

A glamorous Polish accountant arranged for a millionaire client to be killed with the help of two teenagers so she could steal his money, a court heard today.

Monika Antosik, 31, allegedly ordered Grzegorz Ostrowski, 19, to carry out the murder of wealthy 86-year-old estate agent Alexander Kucharski.

With the help of a 15-year-old girl, the teenager reportedly killed the pensioner at his house in Warsaw, Poland, before chopping up his body.

The pair then hid his remains in a suitcase and set it alight in a nearby forest, it is alleged.

Antosik is believed to have used the tips and knowledge she had gained during her previous job as a prison officer to arrange the killing.

Now, she has gone on trial at a Polish court charged with one count of murder.

The court heard that Antosik had hatched the murderous plan after discovering Mr Kucharski was worth several million euros.

With her in-depth knowledge of various crimes, she felt the plan was a 'get rich quick' scheme that could not fail, it was alleged.

She therefore reportedly coaxed Ostrowski into breaking into the pensioner's house and killing him.

Ostrowski, in turn, persuaded the unnamed teenage girl to help him and after murdering Mr Kucharski, they allegedly chopped up his body and hid the remains in a suitcase.

They then dumped the case in a nearby wood, before returning and setting fire to it two weeks later, the court heard.

The horrific crime was only discovered after Polish police found Mr Kucharski's charred remains buried in the forest, and started searching for his killers.

Anna Zeromska, prosecuting, told the court: 'The woman had prepared a very precise plan, the motive for which was the acquisition of the victim's property.

'Following the murder, she was ready to implement the next part of the plan and preliminary findings suggest she was preparing false documents including fake legal papers.'

Police arrested Antosik after it emerged the drafted legal documents connecting the accountant and her client had been forged.

If convicted of murder, the blonde accountant faces life in prison.

Ostrowski and the 15-year-old girl have also been charged with murder.

The girl will have to appeal before a Juvenile Court.

The trial continues.
