Sitting by her hospital bed and reading books and cards from well-wishers, Malala Yousafzai is a symbol of courage.

The 15-year-old girl was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan, after she defied them by writing about the importance of education for females.

Flown to Britain for surgery after the bullets grazed her brain, the inspiring teenager is now starting to recover - and began by thanking her supporters around the world for their 'inspiring' well-wishes.

Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan, has thanked people around the world for their humbling support

Thousands have signed a petition asking that the teenager, who called for female education, be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize

Her message came as thousands of people have called for her to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for her demand for women's education in Pakistan, a right that the Taliban opposes.

Speaking on behalf of Malala exactly a month after she was targeted on a school bus, her father Ziauddin Yousafzai said she wanted to thank well-wishers for helping her to 'survive and stay strong'.

Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death by inches when a bullet 'grazed' her brain on October 9.

She was in her school van on the outskirts of the city of Mingora in the Taliban-held Swat Valley when men with guns stopped the vehicle.

They demanded that other girls 
identify Malala who, in early 2009, had written an anonymous blog about 
life under the Taliban, who had banned all girls in her area from 
attending school.

The 
gun-weilding terrorists shot two girls, who suffered 
non-life-threatening injuries, and fired at Malala, striking her in the 
head and neck, according to officials.

Malala was travelling home from school with two classmates when she was shot at point-blank range by extremists who boarded her school bus

The shooting sparked international outrage and the Taliban issued a statement online saying that, if Malala were to survive, they would attack her again.

Mr Yousafzai, his wife and their two sons flew to the UK last month to be with Malala, who was travelling home from school with two classmates when she was shot at point-blank range by extremists.

In a statement issued by the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Yousafzai said: 'She wants me to tell everyone how grateful she is and is amazed that men, women and children from across the world are interested in her well-being.

'We deeply feel the heart-touching good wishes of the people across the world of all caste, colour and creed.'

Malala,
 who has been praised for her courage in campaigning for the rights of 
women and girls in Pakistan, has received thousands of gifts, cards and 
messages of support since arriving in Birmingham on October 15.

Among
 the gifts are pocket money 'for sweets', the teenager’s favourite CDs, 
school books, clothing, toys and jewellery, while whole classes of 
pupils have written letters and messages supporting Malala’s campaign 
for girls’ education.

Since arriving at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (seen here on on October 19) the Pakistani schoolgirl has begun to make a slow recovery after being targeted for demanding education

In his statement, issued as new pictures were released showing his daughter sitting up reading a book and looking through cards sent to her, Mr Yousafzai added: 'I am awfully thankful to all the peace-loving well-wishers who strongly condemn the assassination attempt on Malala, who pray for her health and support the grand cause of peace, education, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.'

Doctors have established that a bullet travelled along the left side of Malala’s jaw, damaging her skull and jaw joint.

The round, which was removed by surgeons in Pakistan, initially struck Malala’s left brow, but, instead of penetrating the skull, travelled underneath the skin along the whole length of the side of her head, and into her neck.

Tomorrow has been declared Malala Day 
by former UK prime minister Gordon Brown in his role as UN Special Envoy
 for Global Education.

The 
'day of action' coincides with Mr Brown’s trip to Pakistan to deliver a 
petition containing more than a million signatures to President Asif Ali
 Zardari, urging him to make education a reality for all Pakistani 
children, irrespective of gender.

While
 campaigners demand educations, more than 60,000 people are backing a 
petition to nominate the brave schoolgirl for the prestigious award.

The call comes ahead of this Saturday’s global day of action marking one month since Malala was shot in the head by the Taliban.

In the UK, Shahida Choudhary is campaigning for the Prime Minister and prominent politicians to write to the Nobel committee to recommend Malala.

Ms Choudhary said: 'Malala doesn’t just represent one young woman, she speaks out for all those who are denied an education purely on the basis of their gender.

'There are girls like Malala in the UK and across the world. I was one of them.

'I started this petition because a Nobel Peace Prize for Malala will send a clear message that the world is watching and will support those who stand up for the right of girls to get an education.'

Ms Choudhary also fought for her education when she was taken out of school in the UK aged 16 and forced into a marriage in Pakistan.

She escaped back to the UK, returned to education aged 28, and now runs a network in Birmingham to support women in similar situations.

The global petition to have Malala nominated, on Change.org, was started in Canada by Tarek Fatah, a writer and broadcaster.

It has already achieved support from Canada’s four largest political parties and has been replicated by supporters in other countries, including France and Spain.

The Nobel Committee rules states that members of national assemblies and governments are able to make nominations for the prize.

Nominations close in February.
