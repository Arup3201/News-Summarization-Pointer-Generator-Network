Experts probing the fire on a Dreamliner which has grounded the whole fleet today released fresh images of the charred battery at the centre of the investigation.

Pictures show the blackened remains of the lithium device as well as a frayed and broken earth wire, designed to reduce the risk of electric shock, which was attached to it at the time it ignited.

Investigators also confirmed that they had linked the in-flight fire which forced the All Nippon Airways service to make an emergency landing in Japan last month to a similar incident in Boston.  

Overheated: The charred battery from the Dreamliner plane which made an emergency landing on January 16 in Takamatsu, is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of GS Yuasa Corp in Kyoto, western Japan

Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery to that suffered by a battery on another Dreamliner which was also forced to make an emergency landing in Boston last month

Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken

The
Japanese Transportation Safety Board released the images as it 
continues to look at the reason why an All Nippon Airways flight was 
forced to land on January 16.

CAT scans of the overheated 
lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a 
week earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency
landing in Boston.

All 50 Boeing 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue.

The
latest probe is said to have found evidence of short-circuiting and 
'thermal runaway' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating.

The
All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in western Japan 
after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell 
was detected in the cockpit and cabin.

An
investigator in Japan at the time said the burned insides of the 
plane's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in 
excess of its design limits.

Experts
from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had already 
disassembled the device believed to have caused the earlier Boston fault
in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted late 
last month that they were no closer to reaching a conclusion.

Charred: A CAT scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery's eight cells were all but destroyed

But a week ago, Elon Musk, the
founder of Tesla Motors said the batteries used by Boeing in its 
Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an 
airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded.

All
Nippon Airways (ANA) said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 
aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed 
other problems.

And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'.

Lithium
ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat 
and are more likely to short-circuit than other types of batteries.

Boeing
built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the 
relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical 
systems on the 787, the world's first airliner made mostly from 
lightweight composite materials.

Investigation: The singed battery case from the Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner which caught fire in Boston is displayed inside an investigation lab at the NTSB Headquarters in Washington, DC

Probe: The state-of-the-art Dreamliner continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues

Burnt: The NTSB's Joseph Kolly, holds part of the badly fire-damaged battery casing from the plane involved in the Boston incident. The battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong

Investigators earlier said they 
found no evidence of quality problems with production of the 787's 
batteries by Kyoto, Japan-based, GS Yuasa, whose own aerospace ambitions
are on the line.

But the issue may have hit the company's business hard judging by its latest figures.

Yuasa
said Tuesday that its April-December net profit fell 3.6 percent to 5.5
billion yuan ($59.6 million) from a year earlier, as demand for 
batteries lagged due to sluggish demand in Japan and overseas.

The
company has struggled to turn its lithium ion business to 
profitability. In April-December its lithium ion business posted a 7.2 
billion yen ($78.2 million) loss, it said, compared with an operating 
loss of 3.26 billion yen in the full-year that ended March 31, 2012.

Although
Dreamliner aircraft are currently grounded because of unsafe batteries,
it emerged last week that restrictions against carrying the batteries 
as cargo were lifted.

Pilots
and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the 
batteries on board at all if the plane's battery system makes it too 
unsafe to fly.

The new 
regulations were brought into effect on January 7 - the same day as one 
of the batteries caught fire on a Japan Airlines 787 flight.

The
aircraft had landed 40 minutes earlier at Boston Airport and almost 200
passengers and crew had disembarked when a cleaning team smelled smoke 
and alerted fire crews.

The 
Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion 
batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving 
shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries.

The
battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two 
fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit 
window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched 
three years late.

Mike 
Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last month that the plane's 
batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never 
had an internal fault.

He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.

Incident: A 787 made a landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also 
detected in its cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines 
have grounded their entire Dreamliner fleets

Complex: Parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world

Out of service: One of United Airlines six 787s sits on the tarmac at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston
