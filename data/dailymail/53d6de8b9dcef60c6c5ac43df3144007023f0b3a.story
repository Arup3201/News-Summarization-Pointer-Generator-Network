Joel Campbell is on the brink of finally joining up with Arsenal for pre-season training after his post World Cup holiday.

Campbell, who starred for Costa Rica in the World Cup, posted a picture on Twitter with his girlfriend in Paris as the 22-year-old striker, who signed for Arsenal in 2011, edges towards a return to London where he will finally get the chance to fight for a place at the Emirates after work permit issues forced him out on loan last season.

Over the weekend Campbell tweeted that he was on his way to ‘fight for his dreams’, suggesting he was focused on the challenge of breaking into Arsene Wenger’s side.

Campbell 
had a magnificent season in Greece last year with Olympiacos and, with 
Wenger on record saying he won’t be bringing in a new striker this 
summer, there might be an opportunity for Campbell to stake a claim for 
first team football at the Emirates this term.

Campbell
 will be hoping to be part of the Arsenal squad that will head to New 
York on Wednesday for a pre-season friendly against Thierry Henry’s New 
York Red Bulls on Saturday.

Alexis Sanchez, the club's £30million capture, will commence pre-season with his new team-mates next week.
