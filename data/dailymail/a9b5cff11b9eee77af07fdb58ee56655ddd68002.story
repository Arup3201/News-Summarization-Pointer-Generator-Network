After ongoing sightings of a five-metre great white shark, Newcastle beaches will be closed on Thursday for a record sixth consecutive day.

One sighting at Nobby's and another at Stockton on Wednesday have forced Newcastle Council life guards to close the beaches for another day, with the council vowing to only reopen after 24 hours without sightings.

It comes as a long-standing Aquatic services co-ordinator for Newcastle Council has said the shark which has been spotted, which is believed to be a five metres long and about 1700kg, is the biggest shark to have ever ever been spotted at the beach, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, the entire coastline remains shut down

Nobbys Beach inspector Scott Hammerton told Daily Mail Australia the beaches were nearly reopened on Wednesday before the first sighting.

'We made it all the way to high-tide at about 3pm. A report came in from a jetski rider of a large shark at Nobby's beach. After that there was another sighting at Stockton.

'Since the council nare calling for a 24 sighting free window it means the beaches are closed again for Thursday.'

Mr Hammerton said some surfers are disregarding the closures and hopping into the water.

'We're urging for the public's cooperation, please stay out of the water until we have the can confirm it is safe to be swimming.'

Newcastle beaches have been closed for a fourth straight day following the sighting of a great white shark

Newcastle Council aquatic services co-ordinator Peter Withers, who has served in the area for 37 years, told Sydney Morning Herald it was the biggest shark he had seen in his career.

'We've consistently seen the big one every day. Certainly it's the biggest shark we've ever had and it's hung around longer than any other shark,' he said.

A statement released by the council urged nobody to be disregard the closures.

'Our lifeguards emphasise that this great white shark is of a size that has not been seen before around Newcastle. It appears to be nearly full grown at an estimated five metres in length which would make its weight around 1700kg.' 

Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday

Rob Townsend, life sciences manager at Manly Sea Life Sanctuary, said the shark's behaviour in staying close to the coastline was not unusual.

'It may be hunting eagle rays, which are a favourite food for sharks and are found close to the shore,' he said.

'Great whites are very variable. They spend time in the surf where they are sometimes spotted by lifeguards and then they also have their massive oceanic migration where they travel to South Africa. They are very adaptable.'

He added that people were better safe than sorry and should keep out of the water while the shark continues to be spotted. 

Lifeguards spotted the shark on Monday and are monitoring its progress between Nobbys and Stockton

When asked why the sharks are sticking around on Monday, Mr Hammerton said there are two prevailing theories.

'One idea is that it's a great white sanctuary. They might be coming in close to the shore to offer warm water to give birth and raise their young.'

'The other idea is that the sharks started appeared in line with a cold current on Saturday. There has been a lot of marine activity in the area since then and the sharks may be following suite,' he said.

Newcastle City Council beach inspector Mick Body says the closure has been the longest in his memory.
