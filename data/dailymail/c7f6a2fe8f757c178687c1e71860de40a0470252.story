Geoffrey Edelsten has vehemently denied he owes the Australian Tax Office $14 million in taxes.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Edelsten said the idea he owed ATO that much money was 'not possible and fictitious'.

It comes as News Corp reported the bankrupted businessman had $14.1 million in fines and taxes outstanding.

Geoffrey Edelsten has vehemently denied he owes the Australian Tax Office $14 million in taxes

But the 71-year-old said it was just a figure that had been quoted in court and was forecasting what he was expected to pay to the ATO by December 2015.

'I'm not earning enough to warrant $14 million,' he said.

'It was said in court and the media has got hold of it. There's no truth to it at all.'

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Edelsten (pictured here with his fiancée Gabi Grecko) said the idea he owed ATO that much money was 'not possible and fictitious'

Mr Edelsten said the most the ATO could chase him for was $5 million, which he would be satisfied to settle on.

'We would be happy for them to get that claim,' he said.

His comments come after the office took steps in the United States to recover what is owned to them through a deal settled between the businessman and his overseas creditors, News Corp reported.

The ATO was able to secure a place at a mediation - which will take place within 60 days - with other creditors.

During this meeting, they will decide among them how to divide up Mr Edelsten's remaining assets.

But according to a lawyer who took part in securing the agreement, the ATO would only be able to recover five cents for every dollar.

The ATO will face opposition from U.S. creditors who will not be keen to let it get a slice of an already small pie as Mr Edelsten's properties are now worth much less then what he paid for.

Florida's Marwadi family have settled with Mr Edelsten over a merger that went bad and has left the 71-year-old broke.

The businessman said he was persuaded to invest more than $20 million on distressed properties like a derelict casino in the Dominican Republic he had not seen before his purchase.

Robert Stok - the Marwadi family's lawyer - told News Corp the ATO should have seized the opportunity to get its money when Mr Edelsten was meant to pay his taxes after he sold off a Victorian Allied super clinic in 2011 for $30 million.

He also pointed out the office had known about the court action for a year and did not make their intentions known until now.

'They should have acted like any taxing agency and enforced payment of the tax obligation by one of its citizens,' Mr Stok said.

'That's what they should have done. They declared he owed them $10m on 2012 — it's even on Wikipedia. Now they're swooping in and trying to upset the applecart.'

Mr Stok, who claimed the ATO would be lucky to get five cents for every dollar of its money owed, said the government agency would be able to recover more if investigations found Mr Edelsten had other assets, such as unsubstantiated interests in the Indonesian coal mining industry, which is worth $10 million.

But Mr Edelsten said Mr Stok had no way of knowing how much the ATO could recover as it was dependent on what the trustee was able to uncover and legal fees spent to recover that sum.

The businessman (pictured with ex-wife Brynne) said he had spent US$3 million on legal fees in the past two years on the U.S. court action.

The businessman added he had spent US$3 million on legal fees in the past two years on the U.S. court action.

The ATO refused to comment on the matter but it was understood by News Corp that the agency could start looking into Mr Edelsten who was accused of moving his money around trusts.

But the Australian Federal Court was able to confirm that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has precedence over any other foreign agencies and it was up to the Florida court to see how money would be handed out.

It was reported judges are pleased with the outcome and were surprised by the result.
