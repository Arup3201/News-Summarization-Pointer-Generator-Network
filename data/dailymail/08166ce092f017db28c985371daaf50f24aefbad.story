The world's largest airline food caterer, which employs thousands of people in Britain, is today at the centre of an FBI investigation into how needles found their way into turkey sandwiches on four international flights.

Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for more than 20 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed the sandwiches that contained what appeared to be small sewing needles.

The needles were discovered in six sandwiches on four U.S.-bound Delta Air Lines planes that departed Amsterdam's t on Sunday.

One passenger on a flight to Minneapolis was injured, but refused medical attention, a Delta spokesman said. The other needles were on two flights to Atlanta and one to Seattle.

Lurking in the turkey: Catering firm Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for 14 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed six sandwiches that contained small sewing needles. They were found aboard six U.S.-bound flights out of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Sunday

Gate Gourmet prepares over 200million meals a year from its 130 flight kitchens in 35 countries around the world.

It services more than 20 airlines 
including Delta Air Lines, British Airways, American Airlines, United 
Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air France, Emirates Airline,  Amtrak and 
EasyJet.

The firm employs more than 22,000 people worldwide. In the UK, British Airways is Gate Gourmet's largest customer.

In 2005, the caterer sacked 670 staff - mainly Asian women - from its airline meals service in a dispute over restructuring at Heathrow. It lost £25million at its operation at the airport the year before, and maintained that changes in working practices were needed.

In August of that year, a two-day wildcat action by British Airways ground staff at Heathrow stopped all the airline's flights leaving the airport.

The strike, in support of the Gate Gourmet workers, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated £40million ($72million).

It also left BA unable to provide normal in-flight meals once services resumed, with many passengers instead being given vouchers with which to buy their food from the airport.

After the BA staff had returned to work, the stand-off at Gate Gourmet rumbled on, with the sacked staff picketing outside the caterer's Heathrow factory.

To try to end the dispute, at the end of August Gate Gourmet offered all staff - including those that had been sacked - redundancy packages.

About 700 staff - 300 of those sacked and 400 from the existing Gate Gourmet employees - applied to accept the offer.

The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the matter.

Spokesman Christina
Ulosevich said the caterer is cooperating 
fully with investigators and has received no reports of similar incidents on
any of the other airlines it serves out of Amsterdam.

She said the company did not yet know how the needles got into the sandwiches but declined to comment further,  saying 'details of this matter must remain confidential'.

Gate
Gourmet issued a statement saying: 'We take this matter very seriously,
and we have launched our own full-scale investigation.'

It also said it is 'heightening our already stringent safety and security procedures, to prevent any recurrence'.

The
sandwiches were made in the Gate Gourmet's Amsterdam kitchen, and were to be served to business class passengers on Delta 
flights out of Schiphol Airport.

After the needles were found, passengers got pizza instead.

Kristin Baur, a spokesman for Delta, said the airline has boosted 
security for its meal production and is using more pre-packaged food 
while the probe continues.

In
a statement to MailOnline, the airline said: 'Delta is taking this 
matter extremely seriously and is cooperating with local and federal 
authorities who are investigating the incident.

The
statement went on: 'Delta has taken immediate action with our in-flight
caterer at Amsterdam to ensure the safety and quality of the food we 
provide onboard our aircraft.

'Delta
requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in 
order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals. The safety and
security of our passengers and crew is Delta's number one priority.'

The needle incident is the latest in a series of troubles for the airline this month.

Last week, a 'pressurisation issue' forced a jet travelling from Detroit to Washington, D.C., to declare an emergency.

Flight plan: All four flights with needles in their sandwiches were heading to the U.S. - including two to Atlanta

The
aircraft, carrying 152 passengers and six crew members, landed without 
incident and taxied to the gate. No injuries were reported.

On
Thursday night, a Delta flight from New York to Madrid was turned 
around shortly after take-off when a federal air marshal found 
suspicious wires in a rear lavatory.

Although
no explosives were found, officials discovered two pieces of a drinking
straw about an inch-and-a-half long with wires running through each. 
The matter is under investigation.
