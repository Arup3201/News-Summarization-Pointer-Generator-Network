They are the misfits and understudies who have emerged as Newcastle United’s leading men.

For no matter the obstacles which are presented – injury, suspension or failure of form – the Magpies manage to put on a show.

On Saturday, during their 2-1 victory over Chelsea, the team included; a 21-year-old goalkeeper making his professional debut, a local lad previously deemed a back-up option, another native of Tyneside seemingly headed for the exit door, a rookie Spaniard plucked from their second tier and a striker the manager suspects isn’t fit.

Meet Jak Alnwick, Paul Dummett, Sammy Ameobi, Ayoze Perez and Papiss Cisse. Before them, unlikely heroes such as Gabriel Obertan, Mehdi Abeid and Rolando Aarons had all starred in a remarkable run which now reads seven wins from nine.

But perhaps Alnwick best demonstrates the newfound resolve and depth of a squad which failed to win any of their first seven in the Premier League, leaving Alan Pardew on the brink of unemployment.

It was just a few weeks ago that Alnwick banged on the boss’s door and told him he had been let down by the club after just one loan spell – at non-league Gateshead – in four years.

But if the young custodian felt aggrieved with his hometown club and his manager, he certainly did not show it after being thrust into the action as a half-time replacement for the injured Rob Elliot, himself deputy to the sidelined Tim Krul.

Within 60 seconds he flattened Diego Costa and then pulled off a string of saves as the league leaders poured forward in search of parity late on. Alnwick, though, resisted.

‘Coming on was amazing, but this is what I’ve been working towards and I was ready for it,’ he said.

‘I was a bit nervous at half time, but that (clattering Costa) was a massive moment. That first touch, if you can make a good punch or anything really, will always give you confidence for the rest of the half.’

By chance, Alnwick’s mum was in the crowd at St James’ Park for the first time in four years.

Ayoze Perez has also been impressive in his first few months at St James' Park

‘Most of my family were there, my mum and dad and my girlfriend. It was amazing because obviously they’ve supported me the whole way,’ he said.

‘They are all lifelong Newcastle supporters. I grew up supporting Newcastle and to play for them in front of 52,000 and beating Chelsea at home, that’s what dreams are made of. I’m looking forward to maybe having a run in the team now.’

Alnwick’s dream debut was made possible thanks to the match-winning double of substitute Papiss Cisse.

Pardew still doesn’t have the confidence to start with the Senegal frontman – who returned from knee surgery in September – but three goals in two cameos from the bench in the past week could change that ahead of Saturday’s trip to Arsenal.

And Cisse said: ‘I feel fit. I’m good. The gaffer just made the decision to put me on the bench. I don’t know why but I’m okay. I’m not angry, I just wait for my time and even if it’s just five minutes I will try to do well for those five minutes.’

Cisse and Alnwick may have the odd gripe with Pardew right now, but they, like the rest of their team-mates, haven’t let him down on the pitch.

Rather, the Magpies misfits are coming together just nicely.
