A pensioner who has always admired her granddaughter's tattoos surprised her family when she announced she wanted some body art of her own.

Eve Codling, 85, from Burnley, Lancashire, endured a 20 minute procedure to have red rose etched onto her upper arm.

The work of art was carried out by her granddaughter, Beki Sanderson, 26, who opened her own tattoo studio in Accrington, Lancs, six years ago.

Never too old for body art: Eve Codling, 85, proudly shows off her first tattoo

Inspiration: Eve had always admired her granddaughter Beki Sanderson's tattoos

Family affair: As Beki is a tattoo artist, she etched the rose on her grandmother's arm

'Prickly feeling': The great-grandmother said it didn't hurt

Married Eve, who has six grandchildren and five great grandchildren, explained: 'I'm incredibly proud of Beki and I think her tattoos are wonderful.

'I think it's
so marvellous that they can do all this beautiful artwork on flesh and I
wanted to show appreciation for Beki and her work, so I asked if she 
would do a tattoo for me.'

As she was: Eve, aged ten, left, used to live in Hertfordshire and was once a Wren in the RAF

She married Stanley in 1948: He said he likes her tattoo but wouldn't want one himself

The retired shop worker, who was born in Hertfordshire and was once a Wren in the RAF, chose the floral design in honour of her late mother, whose first name was Rose.

She said: 'I'm very happy with my tattoo. I'm happy I chose a Rose for my mother. My middle name is also Rose and it symbolises the Lancashire rose so I am very pleased with it indeed.

'I
didn’t think it hurt at all, it was more like a prickly feeling. But I 
do think one tattoo is enough for me and I won’t be getting anymore 
done.'

Beki, who has a seven-year-old daughter, Lexie, said she was initially reluctant to fulfil her grandmother's wishes.

Proud: Eve with Beki as a baby

Grown up: Beki now has her own tattoo studio in Accrington

She
said: 'I don't think anyone in the family really believed grandma when 
she kept saying she wanted me to do a tattoo for her. I think we all 
thought she'd gone a bit mad.

'But she kept on asking and then one Saturday we were out having coffee and grandma turned to me and said "when are you going to do my tattoo?" that's when I realised she was being serious.

'I had a slot free that afternoon so I brought her into the studio and sat her down at my work station. I kept asking "are you sure you want to do this, grandma?" but she was one hundred per cent certain so we just got on with it from there.

Beki has many tattoos and admitted she was initially reluctant to tattoo her grandmother in case she hurt her

Flower power: Eve chose a rose in memory of her mother

Delighted with the result: Beki thought her grandmother had been kidding about getting a tattoo but was happy to oblige when she knew she was serious

She added: 'I was absolutely petrified about tattooing my gran. I was worried it was going to hurt her but she just didn't seem phased at all. She didn't squirm, she just sat there and said "ooh" a few times. I was definitely more nervous than she was.

'The tattoo took about twenty minutes altogether. After I'd finished gran seemed really impressed with the final result and now she's always showing it off to her friends.'

Eve, who lives with retired sales director husband Stanley, 86, said she's delighted with the result: 'I am very glad I have finally had it done after all those years of thinking about it, and I am glad Beki was the one to do it for me too.

'My friends are all amazed but love it too. They think I’m very brave. My husband likes the tattoo but he wouldn't have one himself.'
