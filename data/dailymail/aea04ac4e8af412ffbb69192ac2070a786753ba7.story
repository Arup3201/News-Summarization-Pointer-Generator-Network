A landlord has been fined for letting a £420-a-month flat whose tenants had to crawl up a tiny staircase to get inside.

Yaakov Marom continued charging for the flat in Hendon, north London, for more than a year after council officers banned him from doing so - saying the 2ft 4ins of headroom was a fire risk.

Now Marom has been made to pay more than £3,000 in fines and costs after he pleaded guilty in court to breaching planning regulations.

Room for a tiny tenant: A landlord has been made to pay more than £3,000 by the courts after letting out this flat in Hendon, north London, for £420 a month - despite there being as little as 2ft 4ins headroom on the staircase

Tenants 
could only reach the second-floor flat by slithering up a staircase 
which became increasingly cramped before hauling their bodies through a 
hatch.

The
 staircase's headroom ranged from 3ft 11ins down to 2ft 4ins, not even 
high enough for a toddler to negotiate standing upright.

The door to the loft room was also reduced in size, a Barnet Council spokesman said. 

Council officers served Marom, 60, with a prohibition order in February 2012 which stopped him using the room for accommodation.

But he was hauled before the courts after officials visited the house with police in September last year and found the room was still being rented by a couple for £420 a month.

Marom, who lives in the same street in Hendon, pleaded guilty on August 5 to failing to comply with an order served by the council prohibiting occupation of the loft room. 

Willesden magistrates ordered him to pay a £1,500 fine, £1,420 in costs and a £120 victim surcharge. 

Barnet Council's housing committee chairman Tom Davey said: 'At the very least tenants have the right to expect that the accommodation they are renting is safe.

'Barnet Council is keen to work with landlords and help them to provide safe accommodation.

'However, those who exploit tenants for financial gain will not be tolerated and the appropriate action will be taken.'

Last year alone Barnet Council investigated almost 1,000 reports of poor housing conditions.

And it comes two months after a London studio flat so small its occupant could reach the sink from the bed was banned from being let - despite a tenant agreeing to the £737-a-month rate within 16 hours.

Council officers in the upmarket borough of Islington, north London, found the flat breached planning regulations because it was too cramped.

The wider squeeze on property demand in London has sent prices soaring, with areas like Hackney experiencing a 14 per cent jump in just a year to April 2014, according to Rightmove.

A Barnet Council spokesman added: 'The council works closely with landlords to improve the conditions of their properties, but when this is not possible, legal action can be taken which may lead to prosecution or work being completed and costs being passed on to the landlord.'
