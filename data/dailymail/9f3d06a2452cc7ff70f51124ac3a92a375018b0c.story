A major Liberal Democrat donor has been arrested as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery at Rolls-Royce.

Sudhir Choudhrie was held by police with his son Bhanu this week. Since 2004 they have given £1.2million to the Lib Dems as personal donations and from their companies.

The Serious Fraud Office is probing claims that Mr Choudrie - who, with his son, strongly denies wrong doing - acted as an intermediary by Rolls-Royce in deals in China and Indonesia.

More than 150 officers from the Serious Fraud Office, the City of London Police and the National Crime Agency swooped on a number of properties in central London.

As a result of the dawn raids on Wednesday, the two men were arrested.

Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie were quizzed at Snow Hill police station before being released on bail without conditions.

The pair deny any wrongdoing and say they are co-operating fully with the authorities.

Bhanu Choudhrie is the chief executive of family firm C&C Alpha Group, which runs care homes in the UK.

The company has donated around £487,500 to the Lib Dems since 2010, according to official Electoral Commission records.

Another firm, Alpha Healthcare Ltd, gave £540,000 to the party from 2004 to 2010.

Bhanu Choudrie gave £30,000 as an individual from 2004 to 2008 while Sudhir Choudhrie has given £155,000 since 2006, including £60,000 in a cash donation to the local party of Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes in November last year.

Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats have received around £500,000 from the Choudhries' family firm since 2010

Sudhir Choudhrie was last year expected to be given a seat in the House of Lords, but it did not happen.

Allegations of criminal activity in relation to alleged bribes emerged last year from a former employee.

In December the SFO said it was launching a criminal investigation.

A spokesman for the Choudhries said: ‘The allegations made against Bhanu and Sudhir Choudhrie are strongly denied. Full co-operation is being given to the authorities.’

A Serious Fraud Office spokesman said: ‘In connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today, Wednesday, 12 February 2014.  Two men were also arrested. 

‘Officers from the National Crime Agency and City of London Police assisted with the operation.'
