A woman who was left scarred for life after she was glassed by a teenage thug has described her attacker's sentence as 'disgusting'.

David Collins, 17, was handed 10 months in a young offender's institute after pleading guilty to hurling a pint glass in Sophie Joyce's face from a distance of just four feet.

Miss Joyce, 20, said she has been left devastated by the attack and shocked that her attacker will be out on the streets again in just five months.

Victim: Sophie Joyce shortly after the sickening attack. The 20-year-old will be scarred for life

Collins hurled a pint glass at the Primark sales assistant outside the M19 bar in Levenshulme, Greater Manchester.

The attack took place in the early hours of May 6.

Thug: Collins was handed 10 months in a young offenders institute

She suffered deep cuts and severe damage to her left eye in the wake of the brutal attack, which she said had changed her life.

She spent five days being treated in hospital and had to undergo four operations on her eye.

She said: 'Ten months is disgusting - it is ridiculous.

'I will have to live with this for the rest of my life and he will be out in five months. And he is only 17 so he shouldn’t have even been in a bar.'

Collins, from Droylsden, was locked 
up for 10 months in a young offenders institution after admitting 
causing actual bodily harm.

Crown Court heard how Collins offered Miss Joyce, from Longsight, some 
rolling tobacco and then flew into a rage because he thought she had 
taken too much.

Collins, formerly of Cypress Road in Droylsden, was arrested at the scene after staff stopped him from fleeing.

Defending Collins, John Wolfson said: 'To say he’s terribly sorry for what’s happened is perhaps an understatement.

'I’m
instructed to apologise deeply to the young woman concerned for the 
catastrophic injury he’s caused her. He feels terrible about it.'

Passing sentence, judge Stephen Riordan QC said: 'What you did was disgraceful, violent and a criminal act.'
