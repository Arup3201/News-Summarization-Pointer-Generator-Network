Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez is hoping to continue his remarkable rise after making his debut for Spain’s Under 21s on Thursday.

Perez played in the 1-0 win over Hungary and with Newcastle team-mate Siem de Jong injured for several months, he will be hoping to force his way into Alan Pardew’s plans.

The 21-year-old has featured in all four of Newcastle's competitive games so far this season following his £1.5million switch from Tenerife.

Speaking to Chronicle Live, Perez said: 'I did not expect to be called up. This has been a greatly appreciated surprise and an immense joy when I found out.

'For any young man representing his country is the best thing. In little time I have experienced many changes, although I can’t ask for more.

'In Newcastle things are going well and now my new team-mates of the U21s have welcomed me very well. I am very happy with the way things are going.

'I want to add my two cents to help my team-mates. My characteristics are more in attack and I consider myself a fast and able player. It’s time to make the most of our time.'
