A 9-year-old boy was forced by his school principal to remove plastic soldier decorations from his birthday cupcakes because she deemed them 'insensitive' and said they could be seen as promoting violence.

Third grader Hunter Fountain was excited to be celebrating his 9th birthday at his elementary school in Caro, Michigan.

He was even more thrilled when his mom unveiled 30 homemade chocolate cupcakes which he helped decorate with his green plastic toy soldiers.

Insensitive: This was the cake Hunter Fountain decorated with his mom which was deemed inappropriate by his headteacher. She removed the toys when he brought the cakes to school for his classmates

His mother dropped them at the school office for the birthday boy and his classmates at Schall Elementary School to enjoy last week

But Principal Susan Wright had other ideas. She removed the toys and called the Fountains to tell them they were an 'insensitive' choice.

She put out a statement standing by her decision today claiming schools had a difficult balance to uphold following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

'It disgusted me,' Casey Fountain, Hunter's dad, told Fox News. 'It’s vile they lump true American heroes with psychopathic killers. We’re just taking political correctness too far.'

He said his son didn't understand what was happening but was just glad that his toys weren't confiscated altogether and he was able to take them home at the end of the day.

Mrs Wright said she wanted to promote non-violence in the school and the soldiers could be seen to breach that.

'These are toys that were commonplace in the past. However, some parents prohibit all guns as toys. In light of that difference, the school offered to replace the soldiers with another item and the soldiers were returned home with the student,' she said.

'In the climate of recent events in schools we walk a delicate balance in teaching non-violence in our buildings and trying to ensure a safe, peaceful atmosphere.

'On one hand, there are those who advocate arming teachers, having armed security guards and creating a fortress of defense in our schools.'

'On the other hand, there are those who feel that guns create fear in schools and we need to put solid security measures in place  plus practice routines to be prepared in case an emergency should ever occur. Living in a democratic society entails respect for opposing opinions.

'By not permitting toy soldiers on cupcakes at school, no disrespect for our military or for the brave men and women who defend our rights to have our differences was intended.

'Our commitment is always to our children and creating a safe place for them to learn, grow and have respectful dialogues about their differences.'

Many people have come forward to support the Fountains after the school's decision.

One commentator took to Twitter to say the move was 'the definition of insanity'.

Another added: 'Maybe the kid just likes soldiers.Didn't you play with them when you were a kid?'
