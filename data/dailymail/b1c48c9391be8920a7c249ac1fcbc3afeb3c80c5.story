Convicted rapist William Danga was allowed to stay in the country

MPs last night accused the Home Office of 'complete failure' as it emerged killers, rapists and sex attackers are among 760 foreign criminals allowed to go on the run.

The 'dysfunctional' department had still not managed to get a grip on the shambolic system for deporting overseas convicts, Westminster's public accounts committee said.

In addition to the criminals who have simply vanished, 151 inmates were freed without even being considered for removal.

Meanwhile, £6.2million in compensation was paid to 229 foreign national offenders because of Home Office delays in dealing with their cases – an average of £27,000 each.

MPs were scathing about the lack of progress since 2006 when then Home Secretary Charles Clarke was forced to resign over the failure to boot out 1,000 foreign criminals. 

Since then, the number of officials working on deportations has increased by 800, from 100 to 900. But, incredibly, the number of overseas convicts clogging Britain's packed jails remains stuck at 10,000.

The annual cost of managing and removing foreign criminals is estimated at £850million. In a joint statement, committee chairman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, and Tory Richard Bacon made a blistering attack on the Home Office.

They said: 'There has been a complete failure to improve the management and removal of foreign national offenders. Despite firm commitments to improve and a massive ten-fold increase in resources, the system still appears dysfunctional.'

The MPs add: 'Processing foreign national offender cases for removal starts too late, takes too long and costs too much. At the most basic, it takes on average 32 days to send out the 50-question paper form to start the process and almost half of these forms are ignored or not returned.

'The approach to case working is grossly inefficient, often featuring avoidable processing delays and administrative errors.' Of the many failures highlighted in the report, arguably the most serious is the loss of contact with 760 ex-inmates.

They were released pending deportation, with strict instructions to stay in contact with the Home Office.

The Conservatives are to use a new Bill of Rights to stop criminals using Human Rights as a 'get out of jail free card'.

Tory lawyers have prepared a draft bill which would stop violent criminals, suspected terrorists and illegal immigrants from claiming the right to a 'family life' to avoid being deported.

British judges would be given the power to ignore rulings from the the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

It could include rulings against the ban on prisoners voting and the police joining trade unions, The Times reported.

But Lord Pannick, QC, a leading human rights lawyer and cross-bench peer, told the newspaper that the bill's architects were using human rights as 'a political tool to be manipulated for narrow and partisan advantage'.

Former Tory Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'If the purpose of this proposal is to take the UK back to where it was before the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, I am pretty relaxed about it — as long as we do not remove the convention itself and retain its authority, which is so vital in dealing with dictatorships and despots.'

However, they have since vanished and cannot be traced. They include as many as 12 killers, 11 rapists, 152 drug dealers, at least 23 other sex offenders – including five paedophiles – 33 robbers and 46 violent thugs.

Overall, there are 4,200 foreign criminals walking Britain's streets who are subject to deportation proceedings.

All serious foreign criminals should at least be considered for removal but, in 151 cases since 2009, this did not happen. This group includes three burglars, 19 robbers and eight sex offenders. Officials have since traced 141 of them, but ten remain at large.

The public accounts committee, Westminster's spending watchdog, highlighted a string of delays and other failings.

For example, only 30 per cent of foreign nationals arrested were checked against a key overseas database for a criminal record last year. MPs say at least £70million a year could be saved if police forces made better use of the information available on this and other databases.

If officials identify a person has a criminal conviction overseas, they can kick them out at an early stage.

Currently, there are over 5,600 foreign national offenders still in prison, immigration removal centres or living in the community after the end of their sentence while the Home Office continues to try to deport them.

To MPs' fury, the Home Office has not been deciding whether to deport foreign national offenders until 18 months before their earliest removal date. Inmates then submit countless appeals to further delay the process.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'This is a damning report of failure and incompetence in Theresa May's Home Office. Previous home secretaries have resigned over this kind of thing. 

These findings come hot on the heels of reports showing growing backlogs in asylum claims, thousands of failed asylum seekers going missing, and major failures in background checks on people claiming British citizenship, which meant a killer was able to become a British citizen.'

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said the failings showed a 'desperate need to tear up the system and start again'.

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said 22,000 foreign criminals had been removed since 2010 despite an almost 30 per cent surge in appeals.

He said last year's Immigration Act, which cuts appeal routes for foreign criminals from 17 to four, and other measures 'will help us identify, remove and ban more foreign criminals than ever before'. 

Rapist: Sex attacker William Danga

A convicted sex attacker who raped two children fought deportation on human rights grounds.

William Danga, 42, was also jailed for a separate rape of a teenager.

One of the children was just four years old when she was abused by the Congolese national.

A judge said in 2011 that it was 'remarkable' Danga had not been thrown out of Britain after he raped the 16-year-old. 

Yet the rapist was freed on immigration bail while he challenged the move on the grounds that he had a right to a family life.

It was deemed that Danga had a right to remain with his family because he has a girlfriend and a young child.

Danga also stalled the deportation process following claims that he had 'mislaid' his passport.

It is believed that Danga is still in Britain.
