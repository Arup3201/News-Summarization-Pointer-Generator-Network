A grieving father who was filmed singing 'Blackbird' to his dying newborn son just days after his wife died has said he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support after the video went viral.

Chris Picco took his guitar and sang the Beatles' hit while baby Lennon James clung to life in an incubator at an Intensive Care Unit in Loma Linda, California.

The new father lost his wife Ashley, 30, just days earlier when she died unexpectedly in her sleep.

Just hours after the heartbreaking performance, his newborn son also passed away. 

At a memorial service for the pair on Sunday he sang the hymn 'This Is My Father's World' as a photo montage showing the final days with his son played in the background.

During a speech that drew both laughter and tears, he said: 'I could never articulate how much your support and your strength, and your prayers, and your emails and your Facebook messages and your text messages.

During a memorial ceremony for Ashley and James in Los Angeles, Chris Picco made a speech that drew both laughs and tears before singing the Christian hymn 'This Is My Father's World'

Hours after Chris tenderly serenaded his baby son at his bedside, Lennon died, aged just four days

Photos from the couple's wedding were shown in the background as family and friends paid emotional tributes to both Ashley and Lennon 

'I don't even know how any of you got my number but there's been a lot of 'thank you'.' 

Throughout the service, recorded by the Adventist Review, a number of friends and family paid tribute. 

Ashley's uncle, Jim Wood, described her as 'a serial hugger' and noted that 'never a curse escaped her lips.'

Marie Reindel, a friend  for more than half her life, said she would miss how Ashley 'smiled with her whole body and her whole heart.' She asked people in the hall to smile at the person beside them.

During his teary-eyed speech, Chris said: 'We have come here tonight to do the impossible. And that is to sum up someone's life in a collection of words or pictures. And we know that's not possible to do. 

'There have been so many people that have reached out and shared their pain: excruciating pain, tremendous loss. And my heart just goes out.'

He thanked the gathered mourners for the outpouring of love he had received since the passing of his son and wife and joked that he didn't know how so many people had his mobile number 

The mourners were also shown the pair's first kiss as a married couple and the pair laughing together at speeches on their wedding day

This is my Father's world,

And to my listening ears

All nature sings, and round me rings

The music of the spheres.

This is my Father's world:

I rest me in the thought

Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;

His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world,

The birds their carols raise,

The morning light, the lily white,

Declare their maker's praise.

This is my Father's world,

He shines in all that's fair;

In the rustling grass I hear him pass;

He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world.

O let me ne'er forget

That though the wrong seems oft so strong,

God is the ruler yet.

This is my Father's world:

why should my heart be sad?

The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!

God reigns; let the earth be glad!

'I've had an outpouring of love and support. Most of them involved "I know words aren't enough".

'Now I know how that feels because when I say thank you to all of you, that's not enough.

'I didn't want to write anything down because I knew that would be harder to do. So forgive my non-linear thinking. 

'When all the questions have passed. I want each and every one of you to join me in asking the question "What now?".

'When you are ready to ask that question, let's dream together, let's see what we can do, let's see how we can live better lives, let's see how we can love more.

'I know that God did not compose this. God had nothing to do with this but I can see him, tears streaming down his face, beginning to compose, one note at a time, the most beautiful melody that anyone has ever heard.' 

He then began singing the Christian hymn, written by Maltbie Davenport Babcock in 1901. 

Picco and his 30-year-old wife were anticipating their son's birth in February when she suddenly became ill. Picco said doctors delivered Lennon by emergency C-section after Ashley died in her sleep Saturday. 

Chris wrote on a memorial page for his wife: 'Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert.'

The service was webcast live - a fitting continuation to a week where the song and other images Picco posted of himself with his wife and their son drew an outpouring of grief and prayers to his Facebook page, YouTube and other sites. 

The couple, married in 2007, met in New York when both were volunteers helping firefighters after the September 11 attacks.

Picco said the story of how he and his wife met shows that something good came out of a tragic event.

'So from this unspeakable tragedy ... I want good to come out of this,' he said.

Friends and family members said Ashley, a preschool teacher turned pediatric nurse, was a nurturing soul who would have been a good mother. They noted that Lennon touched many lives during his very short life.

'If you measure a life by the power of connection, Lennon lived more than most of us have,' said Tim Gillespie, a speaker at the service. 

Hours after Chris tenderly serenaded his baby son, Lennon died, aged just four days.

In a message to his friends, family and supporters, Chris wrote: 'My little fighter, Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy's arms late last night. 

'He was surrounded by family, friends, and the best doctors, nurses and hospital staff in the world. He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him, with little guitars on it, and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend.'

The message continues: 'I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him. His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him, touch him, bathe him, sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing. 

'I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed, to cherish him while mommy carried him, meet him face to precious face, and hold his perfect little body while we said 'goodbye for now'. 

'There are no words, but I wanted to keep you updated, as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world. All you need is love.'

Chris said he was 'so thankful for the four unforgettable days' he got to spend with his newborn son

Chris wrote on a memorial page for his wife that Ashley would often 'feel Lennon moving to music so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert'

The touching video was uploaded to YouTube and  posted to Reddit, where messages of support started pouring in.

A memorial fund set up in honor of Ashley has already surpassed its $50,000 goal, and the total continues to rise as the touching video of Chris and Lennon is shared on the internet.

A message on the memorial page reads: 'Ashley Picco was a rare light, a gracious care giver, and deeply in love with her husband Chris. 

'They were looking forward to becoming parents and raising their son together. Tragically and unexpectedly her life was cut short.'

The Ashley Picco Memorial Fund will be used to cover medical expenses and to help ensure that Chris and Ashley's family face fewer financial challenges in the future.
