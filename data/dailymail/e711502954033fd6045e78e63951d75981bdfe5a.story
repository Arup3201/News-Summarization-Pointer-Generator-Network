Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen says Wales have not been affected by uncertainty surrounding the venue for next week's opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra.

The Football Association of Wales said on Wednesday that the game would take place as planned at Andorra's new National Stadium, where a recently-laid 3G artificial surface attracted close scrutiny from UEFA officials.

'UEFA has confirmed that the match will go ahead in Andorra after the 3G pitch was given the green light,' the FAW posted on its official website.

No concern: Joe says Wales have not been affected over the uncertainty surrounding Andorra's pitch 

Plans were in place to switch the game to Barcelona had the surface failed final checks, but the go-ahead has now been given just six days before Wales' Euro 2016 kick-off.

'It doesn't matter what pitch we play on, whatever surface, our focus on is how we play and perform,' Allen said.

'We have got to be confident whatever happens - we are there to get three points, and we have got to make sure that's what we do.

'We would prefer to play on grass, that's what we do week in week out and it's an obvious preference.

'But we've all played on artificial surfaces enough times to know what to expect from it, and it's not a problem.

'It's not been an ideal situation not knowing where we were playing the game. It's been more of an issue for fans with their travel arrangements, and you feel for them.

'But as a squad it's not something we've talked about too much. It's not been affecting our preparations and we will get on with it.'

Wales will not train on a 3G surface before tackling the Group B minnows next Tuesday, but they should encounter few problems - either with the pitch or their opponents.

And a strong start would set them up nicely for next month's successive home games against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus.

'It is a huge tournament, and we can't wait to get the campaign under way,' Allen added.

'It sounds obvious to say it, but the start is vital. You want to get off the mark with a quick three points.

'We've got the belief and confidence we can make a good start and make big things happen in this group. It is a long road, but every minute we are together counts towards that end goal.

'The change in the amount of teams that qualify has given us a boost. That, coupled with the players we've got, we are really confident we can hit the ground running.

'It is a group filled with tough teams, but we feel we can compete with them all.'

Wales manager Chris Coleman will travel with a squad that contains star men Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, and their combined impact is not lost on Allen.

'We've got the likes of Gareth and Aaron, who have played consistently at the highest level for their clubs, and they are going to bring that to the table for us as well, which is fantastic,' he said.

'We expect to perform, and we have the quality to win the game. It's as simple as that, really.

'There is strong competition for places, and that always breeds success.

'No-one can rest on their laurels. They know if they take their eye off the ball and don't perform to the level expected, then someone else is going to take their place.

'In training, you can see the standards have improved, and that can only hold us in good stead, really.'
