An 18-year-old has died after allegedly tombstoning into a disused quarry in a new take on the 'ice bucket challenge'.

Cameron Lancaster was found in Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, after a four-hour search in the deep water. 

Police were called to the disused site shortly before 5pm on Sunday, where the teenager is thought to have spent the day with friends.

It is claimed he jumped feet-first into the water in response to the internet craze that has seen people around the globe pour buckets of ice water over their head for charity. 

Tragic: Cameron Lancaster, 18, was found in a quarry after allegedly tombstoning for the ice bucket challenge

Discovered: His body was pulled from Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, at 9pm on Sunday

Emergency services were sent to the scene and the man's body was recovered at about 9pm. 

Mr Lancaster was believed to be from Burntisland, around seven miles from the scene.

The quarry is a popular site for 'tombstoning', an activity where people jump feet-first off a cliff into shallow water. 

In a statement released by Police Scotland, his family said: 'Cameron died in a tragic accident. His death is such a great loss.

'During his short life, he touched so many people with his friendliness, kindness and thoughtful generosity of spirit. He will be hugely missed by his family and friends.

'The family are finding it hard to come to terms with this sudden loss and would ask for privacy at this sad time.'

A police spokesman said: 'Inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances of what happened and Police Scotland's thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time.' 

SNP councillor Alice McGarry, who lives just 150 yards from the quarry, said she knew a number of new tombstoning videos had been posted on YouTube this week.

Tributes: People paid tribute to the 'generous and thoughtful' teenager who was said to have jumped 80 feet

They show youngsters plummeting up to 80 feet into the water.

The councillor added that she had seen numerous youngsters in the area over the weekend.

The tragedy comes two years after the Coastguard condemned tombstoning in the quarry, branding it 'foolhardy and dangerous'.

Mrs McGarry said: 'Because we live so close to the quarry we were aware of what was going on.

'In fact my husband and daughters had just been picking brambles nearby before it all kicked off.

'There were fire tenders, ambulances, the police helicopter. At first we heard someone had broken their back and someone had jumped in to save him.

'But then we just heard it was a teenager.

'There have been one or two incidents. It's 30-plus years since there was a fatality at the quarry. Whatever happened, it's really awful. Really upsetting.'

Found: Emergency services reached the site in Inverkeithing, south Scotland, by helicopter 

Locals posted tributes and speculated about the cause of the boy's death on Twitter.

Rory Fell said: 'Crazy about that lad from Inverkeithing, thoughts go out to his family and pals alike.

Euan Donaldson wrote: 'Tragic to hear a boy died at inverkeithing quarry today. Apparently was trying to do the ice bucket challenge. Thoughts are with his family.'

Two years ago there were warnings of a serious accident when a video, titled 'Inverkeithing Quarry Big Jump' was posted on YouTube.

The jumper is given a countdown before taking the plunge into the water.

Fred Caygill, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), said then: 'Jumping from height into unknown depths of water from cliffs, from a quarry face, bridge or harbour wall is foolhardy and dangerous.'

Tributes 
were paid by Cameron's school, remembering him as a dedicated musician 
and member of a local sailing club who had only left school in May.

Iain
 Yuile, headteacher at Cameron's former school, said: 'Everyone at 
Inverkeithing High School is shocked and saddened by the news.

'Cameron was a very popular pupil who had a great passion for drama and music.

'Most recently he performed at our Annual School Awards Ceremony in June.

'Our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time.'
