Comedy news show The Roast, broadcast a controversial animation depicting Prime Minister Tony Abbott's mother having sex with a solar panel

A controversial animation aired by ABC's The Roast, has depicted Tony Abbott's mother having sex with a solar panel.

The comedy news show's skit, which aired on Monday night, was focused on analysing the government's review of the renewable energy policy, when it asked the question 'does Tony Abbott hate the environment and what does he have against renewable energy?'

In response, presenter Nich Richardson introduced the animation which showed Tony Abbot in a shirt that read: 'I love the earth' while walking into his mother's bedroom in 1966 after hearing suspicious noises.

'Mum, what's that noise? Mum, what's happening? Who's that next to you. Solar panel!'

The solar panel, emerging from the sheets, then stated: 'I'm your new daddy, get used to it.'

Fast forwarding to the 'present day', the animation showed Mr Abbott sitting at a desk while a voice asked 'Prime Minister, what are we going to do with all these solar panels?'

'Destroy them all! No solar panel is going to be my daddy!' Cartoon Abbott replied.

The cartoon version of Mr Abbott was shocked to find his mother in bed with a solar panel who said: 'I'm your new daddy, get used to it'

Mr Richardson, addressing the show's audience, went on to say: 'It is literally the only logical reason why he would destroy a renewable energy policy that is working so well'.

It's not the first time the ABC has broadcast controversial fictional footage of a politician, with the skit serving as a reminder of the television series At Home With Julia, which in one episode depicted former prime minster Julia Gillard having sex with her partner while wrapped in the Australian flag. 

More recently, the Chasers were criticised of their depiction of journalist Chris Kenny having sex with a dog in 2013.

Despite dubbing the depiction 'tasteless', ABC's managing director Mark Scott defended the skit.

'Did I like it? No, not very much.Do our policies give a pretty broad licence? Yes,' Mr Scott said, according to Mumbrella.

' Will there be occasions when we say no that isn't appropriate? Well there will be occasions like that and there have been occasions like that in the past.

'But this was on a high profile issue, a high profile person, those of us in the public eye have different standards applied to us as far as satire is concerned and that's how we saw it but I didn't like it much.'

Daily Mail Australia has approached the ABC and the Prime Minister's office for comments.
