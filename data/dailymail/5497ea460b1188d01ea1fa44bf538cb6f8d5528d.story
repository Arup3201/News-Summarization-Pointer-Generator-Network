Paula Deen's name will soon be proudly plastered on a new restaurant, despite many believing it had been dragged too far through the mud to return.

The TV chef's comeback trail appears to be in full swing, and it's leading her to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where she will open the doors to 'Paula Deen's Kitchen' in the summer.

A hub for tourists visiting Dolly Parton's 'Dollywood' theme park and the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Pigeon Forge draws about 10 million vacationers a year - and Deen hopes to cash in.

Comeback? Paula Deen, pictured on February 23,  is launching a new restaurant as she strives to return to fame

The news comes after the Savannah, 
Georgia, celebrity launched a new company, Paula Deen Ventures, to 
manage her return to fame following her racism scandal last year.

Earlier
 this month, Deen, who lost many of her sponsorship deals after she 
admitted to using racial slurs, announced the company was getting a 
massive $75 million from a private investment firm.

On
 Wednesday, she said Paula Deen Ventures was pouring $20 million into 
the 20,000-square-foot restaurant, which will be at The Island real 
estate development.

The restaurant is expected to open in late summer this year.

The TV chef already operates The Lady & Sons in Savannah.

Deen's
 new company comprises Paula Deen Foods, Paula Deen Media, Paula Deen 
Restaurants, Paula Deen Cookware and Paula Deen Home.

According
 to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the private investment company, 
Najafi Media, is an affiliate of Najafi Cos., which often chooses to 
invest in enterprises that have run into trouble.

Deen
 lost four buffet restaurants in casinos operated by Caesars 
Entertainment last year during the fallout from the controversy.

It
 also led to Deen's Food Network show being canceled and the loss of 
dozens of product endorsements, including Smithfield Foods.

After announcing Paula Deen Ventures 
earlier this month, Deen made her first major public speech last Sunday,
 and began maneuvering for a comeback.

She turned a beachside cooking demonstration into a public apology for the racist comments that decimated her career last year.

The former Food Network star took the stage to prepare chicken and dumplings at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, but before beginning asked the crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment.

Without ever explicitly discussing 
the allegations or comments she has admitted making, she said she was 
glad to be back and that, 'I am not a quitter.'

'We
 have come off of a very hard summer my family and I, my team, my 
partners,' she said to a cheering crowd of several hundred fans.

'But 
you know, I have heard on more than one occasion ... that I've never 
apologized. So if anybody did not hear me apologize, I would like to 
apologize to those who did not hear me.'

Deen has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since then, even avoiding the Food Network's 20th anniversary party last October. But lately, she has made it clear she wants back.

And Sunday's crowd seemed primed for it all, shouting out to her 'You don't need to apologize!' and 'We want you back, Paula!'

'Ya'll's cards and letters that I got, helped me get out of bed every day' she replied.

Midway through the demo, Food Network star Robert Irvine joined Deen onstage.

Before a roaring crowd, Irvine then got down on his hands and knees while Deen straddled his back and rode him across the stage, a reenactment of a gimmick they'd done during a previous festival.

'I'm back in the saddle!' she yelled to the crowd.
