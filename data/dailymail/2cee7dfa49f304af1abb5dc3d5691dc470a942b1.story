Vanished: Hany Nabil Mustapha, 46, was trying to sailing from Poole, Dorset, to Hayling Island, near Portsmouth

A BUSINESSMAN disappeared at sea only hours after buying a yacht and sailing off to meet his wife.

Hany Mustapha was last seen sailing out of Poole harbour with his new purchase on Saturday, the day after he had celebrated his 46th birthday.

He was planning to travel 46 miles to Hayling Island, near Portsmouth, where his wife Liz, 44, was to join him the next day.

But his yacht, Brigand, was found grounded on a sandbank with the engine still running and one sail up, near Brighstone, Isle of Wight, at 5.15pm on Saturday.

Despite an extensive search by coastguard helicopters and RNLI lifeboats, no sign of him has been found and the search was called off on Sunday.

Coastguards had received no distress signal from the Brigand and it is believed Mr Mustapha was wearing a buoyancy aid rather than lifejacket when he left the harbour.

An experienced yachtsman who is studying for his Master Yachtsman certificate, Mr Mustapha, from Worcester Park, South-West London, is a member of the Thames Motoring Yacht Club.

Described as ‘fit and active’ by his surgeon father Nabil, he is also a keen sportsman who cycles ‘everywhere he goes’ and plays cricket and golf.

The day before picking up the new yacht, he had celebrated his birthday at a Chinese restaurant in Surrey with his wife, his daughter from his first marriage, Nadia, 19, his parents, his sister May, 47, and her three children.

His family said he had been excited about collecting the boat and his trip to Hayling Island.

Mystery: 'Brigand', which Hany Mustapha had bought the same morning, washed ashore with nobody on board

Empty: Rescue services began a land, sea and air search after a member of the public found the boat

The small boat was found on the Isle of Wight with its engine running and one of its sails still up

He had driven down to Poole after the meal so he could be ready pick it up in the morning.Mr Mustapha is thought to have paid £750 for the boat, a  21-foot pocket cruiser, that had been advertised on eBay.

His relatives are baffled at his disappearance. His mother Laila said: ‘He loves the water and he did it [sailing] impressed when I went on his boat.

He is always very careful. If something about the water looked dangerous, he would not do it.’ She described her son and his wife as ‘very close’. ‘He has a very good relationship with his wife,’

she said. ‘She is always with him. She is a great rock for him. She encourages and supports him in every way.’

The birthday meal had been his daughter Nadia’s idea and she had come back from university in Aberystwyth to join the party, which was organised by her grandparents. 'He was so happy.'

Mr Mustapha’s mother  said. ‘He was joking, asking me if I had to put the 4 and the 6 on his cake. He just said “thanks so much for all of this Mum”.’

Mr Mustapha is director of several IT businesses and was described by family as ‘very successful’ and ‘determined’.

His parents are of Egyptian origin but he and his sister were born in Aylesbury.Neighbours in the cul-de-sac where Mr Mustapha and his wife live described him as ‘always smiling’.

‘We are all praying for him,’ said one. ‘He is such a nice person, he was always very friendly and good with the children. He is really lovely.’

A woman answered the door at the couple’s £430,000 semi-detached house but declined to comment.

A Solent Coastguard spokesman said: ‘The search has been suspended but if we get any new information that prompts us to an area then we will recommence a search.’

Earlier this month, millionairess Mary Unwin, 65, disappeared on a voyage around Land’s End in her new £32,000 boat, a wedding present from her husband. Hopes of her survival faded after wreckage was found along the coast.
