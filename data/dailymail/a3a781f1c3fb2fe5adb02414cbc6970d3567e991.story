Four people were arrested in Massachusetts on Friday after police stopped a car containing 1,250 packets of heroin with red stamps reading, 'Obamacare' and 'Kurt Cobain.'

The car was pulled over on Interstate 91 after officer Joseph Petty, who was making a traffic stop in Northampton, saw another vehicle pass by making several traffic violations. Evidence of illegal narcotics led Petty to call officer David Stucenski and a K9 named Frankie to sniff the stash, reported the Economic Policy Journal.

Tyler Robenstein, Ashley Beaulieu, Marquese Jones, and Sherod Green of were taken into custody and will face drug possession and conspiracy charges.

Robenstein was driving the car and was also charged with speeding, diving without a license, and failure to change lanes for an emergency vehicle.

CNN reported that the Hampshire County Jail released Robenstein and Beaulieu on bond and that Jones and Green were still being held.

State police told CNN that the stamps have nothing to do with Obamacare and are just nicknames for the strain of drug so that people know what they're getting.

'It's a branding by the particular drug dealer so when the drug gets out to the population, you know what it is,' said Police Lt. Daniel Richard. 'It's just a branding so you can say if this brand is good or bad. It's like putting Pepsi or Coca-Cola on a bottle.'

Richard told The Daily News that he'd heard of branded drugs, but never one called Obamacare.

The names stamped on the drug, 'Obamacare' and 'Kurt Cobain' are marketing tools so that buyers know what type of drug they are getting
