Huge price difference: The site of this modest one-bedroom trailer in the Hamptons in New York's Long Island was bought for just $300 in 1956. But nearly six decades on, the property (including the $15,000 trailer, pictured above) is on sale for a whopping $1.1million

All about the location: The property, owned by fisherman, Richard Lester, 79, sits in the exclusive Amagansett South enclave, where a home recently fetched $4million. Its new value, $1.1million,  is likely due to the Hamptons's popularity with celebrities and bankers

Another feature: In addition to a trailer, the site also features a blue-colored shed crammed with fishing gear and storage boxes

According to Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which has listed the site, it could easily be transformed into a 4,000sq ft house with a huge swimming pool.

On its website, the real estate company tells potential buyers: 'You are not dreaming, this mobile home is over a third of an acre on a private third of an acre flag lot in Amagansett South. Just a mile away from Indian Wells Beach, south of the highway location adjacent to a home that just sold for $4M.'

It adds: 'Use as is now, while you plan for your 4,000 square foot new house with 20 foot x 50 foot swimming pool.'

Speaking to the New York Post, Mr Lester explained how he had moved the $15,000 wood-paneled trailer to the $300 land in the late 1950s.

'I had to work my a** off to get that,' said Mr Lester, who lives in the small property with his wife, Tess, and still works at sea.

He added he was shocked by the site's new value, $1.1million, which is likely due to the Hamptons's popularity with celebrities and bankers.

Front garden: According to Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the site could easily be transformed into a 4,000sq ft house with an enormous swimming pool. 'Use as is now, while you plan for your 4,000 square foot new house with 20 foot x 50 foot swimming pool,' the firm says

Mobile home: Mr Lester explained how he had moved the $15,000 wood-paneled trailer (pictured) to the $300 land in the late 1950s. 'I had to work my a** off to get that,' said Mr Lester, who lives in the small property with his wife, Tess, and still works as a fisherman.

When asked if he ever thought he would land 'the big one' in the property world, he replied: 'Not in God’s world. I think it’s ridiculous!'

Listings agent Ray Lord, of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said the price of the site is based solely on its exclusive, highly sought-after location.

Indeed, the Hamptons is not only a desired location for wealthy homebuyers, but also a popular summer hot-spot for sociable multi-millionaires. 

There are now a handful of Hamptons owners who each year ask for more than a million dollars to rent out their pads for roughly two months.

Homes in the area come with the type of perks you would typically find at a five-star resort, including outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts. 

Many also feature indoor pools, basketball courts, bowling alleys, indoor half-pipes and racquetball courts that convert to squash courts. 

Speaking of Mr Lester's on-sale land, trailer and shed, Mr Lord said: 'Erase the trailer from your mind and it’s $1million for land.'

He added that all potential buyers so far have been builders. 'No one, I imagine, would build less than a three-bedroom, three-bathroom house,' he said.
