Road to recovery: Lyam Baker, 15, has finally been diagnosed with Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day

A teenager who used to vomit up to 15 times a day, spent six months on a psychiatric ward before her mother finally convinced doctors she had a physical condition, rather than a eating disorder.

Lyam Baker, 15, shrank from a healthy size 12 to a size zero within months after developing Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day.

But medics believed the teen was purposely making herself sick - and held her on a mental health ward for months before her mother finally convinced them she was suffering from CVS.

The condition caused Lyam, from Birmingham, West Midlands, to vomit up to 15 times a day - and at her worst, she weighed just six and a half stone.

Her mum, Carol, a nurse, desperately tried to convince doctors that her daughter was not suffering from an eating disorder .

But medics didn’t realise that Lyam was actually suffering from the rare condition, which started after she got scared on a school camping trip.

Ms Baker said: 'Lyam’s illness very quickly took over our lives.

'Her vomiting cycles were furious and frequent and she spiralled downwards quickly, and her weight declined rapidly.

'She went from being a bright, bubbly
girl, to constantly being exhausted and a shell of her former self- it 
is a very lonely illness.

'I
painfully watched my daughter withering away while the doctors kept 
insisting she was doing this to herself - she said she wasn’t and I 
believed her.

'I had to fight and fight to get the doctors to listen to me - I don’t want any other family to have to go through what I did.'

Weight loss: Lyam, shrank from a size 12 to a size zero within months - she missed almost two years of school with sickness episodes, which can be triggered by feelings of stress or excitement, occurring on an almost weekly basis

Onset: Lyam first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone

Lyam first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone.

She got so stressed that she started 
vomiting - and for the next 18 months, continued to suffer horrendous 
vomiting episodes that could last for up to five days - where she would 
be sick up to 80 times in a week.

The
condition meant that bright Lyam missed almost two years of school with
sickness episodes, which can be triggered by feelings of stress or 
excitement, occurring on an almost weekly basis.

Ms Baker said: 'Every time Lyam had another episode, she would be admitted to hospital for a few days and then discharged.

'Everyone
kept telling me it was a psychiatric issue, but I could see that it 
wasn’t. The consultant called in the mental health team and eventually 
admitted her to a psychiatric unit.

'While Lyam was there, staff would take away her vomit bowl, and even hold her against the wall in a bid to break the cycle.

'There
had been a brief mention of CVS when Lyam first started being sick - 
but doctors seemed to totally disregard it for months.

'I
was so worried they would never discover what was wrong with her, I 
used to cry myself to sleep at night. I thought I was going to end up 
planning her funeral.'

CVS is characterised by recurrent, prolonged attacks of severe vomiting, nausea and lethargy, with no apparent cause.

Vomiting persists at frequent intervals, 5-6 times per hour at the peak, for periods ranging from hours to10 days or more.

It most commonly lasts for between 1 and 4 days and the sufferer is generally in good health between episodes.

There is no diagnostic clinical or laboratory tests for CVS itself - it can be diagnosed when other condition have been eliminated.

Who gets CVS?It is thought that anyone can potentially get CVS. Sufferers are more likely than average to have a family history of migraine, and/or travel sickness sometimes.What triggers a vomiting episode?For many with CVS there is nothing obvious that starts an attack, for others some specific 'triggers' can be identified which may initiate a CVS episode. Physical stress is one of the most common triggers. Going without food for too long and sleep deprivation can also act as physical triggers.

When does it start?The onset of CVS can occur from infancy to adulthood. It most commonly develops between the age of 3-7 years and it can persist from months to decades. It affects males and females equally.

It
was only after almost 12 months on the ward that specialists eventually
realised that there was something physically wrong with Lyam - and were
able to give her medication in a bid to control the vomiting.

Ms Baker added: 'Lyam’s symptoms have subsided recently - she now hasn’t had an attack for a few months.

'She is slowly putting on weight again, and is able to go back to school.

'I am finally getting my daughter back. It’s very painful to talk about, but I need people to be more aware of CVS.

'We
don’t know exactly why her condition has improved suddenly, it could 
just be a hormonal balance - but we’re hoping she won’t have to suffer 
again.

'We need people,
and medical professionals especially, to be more aware of this 
condition and hopefully sufferers will be able to be diagnosed more 
easily.

'I don’t want any other family to go through what we have done.'

Dr Robin Dover, from the Cyclical 
Vomiting Syndrome Association, said: 'No-one really knows for sure what 
causes CVS, although in the last couple of years, there has been 
research carried out which suggests it may be caused by genetic changes 
that can be inherited.

'It’s
difficult to say how many people suffer from the condition, because 
diagnosis is so complicated and many people are never properly 
diagnosed.

'However, 
studies carried out in Australia and the UK suggest that somewhere 
between 0.1  and two per cent of the population can be affected at some 
point in their lives.

'There
are no tests to diagnose CVS, and therefore it is always a case of 
eliminating every other possible cause of sickness before a diagnosis 
can be made.

'Similar symptoms of vomiting can be caused by a range of problems from a brain tumour to kidney abnormalities.

'But
often the most hurtful thing that happens is that patients are told 
that they have mental health issues - it can be torturous for the 
sufferers and their families, and often ends up delaying a proper 
diagnosis.'

Brighter future: Lyam and her mother Carol: 'I am finally getting my daughter back. It's very painful to talk about, but I need people to be more aware of CVS,' said Lyam's mother
