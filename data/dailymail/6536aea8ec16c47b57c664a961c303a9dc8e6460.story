Jules Bianchi remains unconscious but breathing unaided following his horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix in October, his parents have announced in a statement.

The Frenchman was left in a coma, suffering a severe head injury after his Marussia left the track and crashed head-on with a recovery tractor which was on hand to clear away the wreckage of Adrian Sutil's Sauber - which had left the track in the same position moments earlier.

The incident took place on lap 43 of an action-packed race, against the backdrop of the approaching Typhoon Phanfone and with a red-flag falling earlier in proceedings.

Conditions worsened as the race neared its conclusion and, behind the safety car, Bianchi lost control - with the FIA panel which investigated the incident finding that the 25-year-old 'did not slow sufficiently' when approaching the dangerous area of the circuit.

Marussia has since folded amid financial difficulties and Bianchi continues his rehabilitation in his native France, with his parents releasing an update on his condition.

'As we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family, we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding Jules' medical situation, per our pledge to communicate continued information, when appropriate, to his many fans,' their statement read.

'It was a significant and very comforting step for us to be able to bring Jules home to France last month, to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends. This is very important for Jules and also for us.

'Since that time, Jules has received the very best treatment in the Intensive Care Unit of Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) and now at the CHU's rehabilitation centre for this kind of trauma.

'Jules' neurological status remains unchanged; he is unconscious but able to breathe unaided. Whilst there is no significant information to report, we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that Jules continues to fight, as we knew he would, and this has enabled the medical professionals caring for him to commence the planned, but very painstaking, programme of rehabilitation therapy.

'As we reflect on the events of the past few months, we would like to acknowledge once again the overwhelming warmth and affection shown towards our son. These continue to be challenging times for our family, but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through.

'We would also like to acknowledge the respect and support shown by the media towards our family during this time, for which we are extremely grateful.

'We will continue to provide information when it is possible to do so and our sincere appreciation to everyone who continues to pray for Jules.'

The rest of the Formula One field gathered at the start line of the Russian Grand Prix, just a week after Bianchi's crash, to pay tribute to their fellow driver's fight and many continue to post regular support on their personal social media accounts.
