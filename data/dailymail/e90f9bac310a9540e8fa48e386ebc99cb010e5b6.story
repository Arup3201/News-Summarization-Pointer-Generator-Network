Edwin Van der Sar has backed Louis van Gaal to remould Manchester United by splashing the cash on the 'right' players for the club.

The Holland coach was announced as David Moyes' successor earlier this week and will get to work on arresting the slide under the previous incumbent.

United have slid out of the Champions League for the first time in years, with portions of their squad needing a complete overhaul.

In safe hands! Edwin Van der Sar to sign the right new players for Manchester United this summer

Moving on: Van Gaal will take over at Man United after this summer's World Cup over in Brazil

And Van der Sar, who played under Van Gaal at Ajax, winning three Dutch league titles and a Champions League, is sure his ex-boss will be a hit.

'Van Gaal will spend the right money on the right player to ensure that they are right for United,' van der Sar told the Daily Mirror.

'He will know if they have the United DNA of the club inside of them. If not he will let them go and let them go to other clubs. You have to play and you have to fight for Manchester United. Not only come for the money.

'What’s more important? £20k or £30k more a week or the privilege of playing for a coach like van Gaal?

'Of course it’s going to be a tricky period for him with the World Cup deciding on what transfers he will need. But if anyone can cope with a situation like this it is van Gaal.

'His credentials in Spain, in Germany, in Holland with the national team speak for themselves.'
