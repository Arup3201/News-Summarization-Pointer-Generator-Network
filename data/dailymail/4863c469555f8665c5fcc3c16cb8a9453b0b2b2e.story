Police are still struggling to find a single lead on the murder of a 15-year-old girl two months after she was found strangled and burned.

Dominique Allen was last seen sitting on her sister's porch in Indianapolis at 4.30am on August 31.

Her burned body was discovered at 12.30pm the same day in the yard of a home three minutes' drive away on a busy street.

Detectives have since scoured the area and found her DNA in an abandoned property across the street from where she was buried, while an autopsy confirmed she was strangled then burned.

But despite the detailed forensic evidence from the scene which has round-the-clock traffic, they have not found a single witness and cannot pin their suspicions on anyone, simply saying it was 'an unknown random attacker'.

'We're jeopardizing the community by keeping this person out there,'  one of Dominique's sisters, Shenika Poindexter, told the Indy Star. 'Somebody knows something.' 

The investigation team believes Dominique - who was visiting the neighborhood - went on to the porch to cool off after an argument with friends.

A car is then thought to have pulled up outside the property, abducted the 15-year-old and taken her to the now-abandoned house three minutes away.

She was strangled to death and then taken across the street where her body was partially burned and buried, officers say.

They have no idea how many people were involved and cannot understand why there are no witnesses that saw Dominique near the home where she was killed.

Police normally patrolling the street had been called to a shooting at a nearby strip club at around 4:30am.

However, detectives insist it is strange that the killer managed to take Dominique into the house and then carry her body and personal effects across the busy street without anyone seeing.

Detective Marcus Kennedy, who is leading the investigation for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, said: 'There were lots of chances there.'

According to Dominique's sisters, she was shy and did not approach strangers.

After her mother died of Crohn's disease in 2012, shortly before two of her best friends were killed in a street fight, Dominique became quiet, they said. 

Call for action: Her sisters have blasted the stagnant case for 'jeopardizing the community' 

'I don't know why you had to do this. Whatever you do, wherever you go, justice is going to be served, in this life or the next,' Poindexter raged in an emotional attack on Dominique's murderer.

'I don't care, they will hunt you until you die. ... She did not deserve this, she did not deserve this, she was 15 years old.'  

In August, Detective Kennedy said: 'At this time, we believe it was random' and described how his team was combing registered sex offenders for possible leads and checking for reported runaways in case there are other victims.

However, the outlook has not changed in two months. 

Kennedy distributed a photograph of Dominique taken the last night she was alive. In it, she's smiling and wearing the sandals that were later discovered.

Her sisters said Dominique, who attended Ben Davis Ninth Grade Center, wanted to be a model and to attend Spelman College in Atlanta.

Deputy Mayor Olgen Williams, who lives a few blocks away from where the girl's body was found, comforted the family at the news conference.

'Pretty young lady, she had a future, and this evil person, or persons, destroyed her life,' he said.
