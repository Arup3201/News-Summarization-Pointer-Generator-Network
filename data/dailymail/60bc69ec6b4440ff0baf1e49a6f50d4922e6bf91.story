A 60mph waterspout hit Tampa, Florida, today, and was caught on camera by a tourist.

Robert Siegel, who is a spotter for the National Weather Service, took the picture while on vacation in the area.

It appeared just off northern Hillsborough Bay at 11.12am.

'Breath of God': Robert Siegel captured the strange weather phenomenon on camera just off the coast of Tampa today

Mr Siegel, of Colorado, snapped the photo as people fled the incoming storm.

'I opened the window, I opened the shades up and I see there is heavy wind and for literally about six or seven seconds, it was like the breath of God came down,' he said.

According to Yahoo News the water tornado hit the Westin Hotel and traveled down a channel between the Tampa Bay Times Forum and the Florida Aquarium.

It didn't cause any injuries but damaged roofing and downed light poles and trees.

Another onlooker, restaurant owner Rachel Prophet, said the waterspout made a 'howling noise' and smashed her restaurant awning through a window above her.

Damage: Part of the roof of the Westin Hotel was ripped off during the waterspout. Business owners on the coastline by Harbour Island said it sounded like a freight train

'I was sitting down eating breakfast, and the wind just started to blow,' she told Tampa Bay Online.

'It was a howling noise, a loud piercing noise. All the trees outside were just whipping, whipping, whipping.'

'I was a little shaken up,' Prophet said. 'I’m not going to lie. I was scared.'

Keith Weitzmann, a cook at the restaurant, said it sounded 'like a freight
 train'.

Bus driver Robert Hagemann told the website he was about to drop off passengers at the Florida Aquarium when the waterspout struck.

'It rocked the bus. It was a short duration, but it was powerful. All kinds of debris were flying around,' he said.

Once over land the waterspout became a weak tornado and cleared later in the afternoon.
