A day after the civil wedding that transformed one-time Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock into the Princess of Monaco, the South African and her prince, Albert II exchanged vows in the religious ceremony yesterday.

The happy both couple both answered 'oui' (yes) to the Archbishop of Monaco, Bernard Barsi, who conducted the service in front of 850 guests.

Wearing an off-the-shoulder Armani 
dress, the new Princess Charlene on Monaco looked serene and beautiful 
as she wed Prince Albert in the courtyard of the Prince's Palace.

The palace said the stunning gown took Armani's team 2,500 hours to prepare, of which 700 hours was spent on the embroidery alone, using 'kilometres' of platinum-coated thread sewn into 130 metres of off-white silk.

The gown would have been heavy for the new Princess, as she would have had to carry the weight of 40,000 Swarovski crystals, 20,000 mother of pearl tear drops and 30,000 'stones in gold shades'.

The dress's crowning glory was the five-metre long train made from 20 metres of silk tulle, which took 100 hours to make.

with oak and olive leave.

Accompanying
 the bride was her maid-of-honour Donatella Knecht de Massy and seven 
young bridesmaids from around Monaco and neighbouring French districts 
wearing traditional taffeta red and white outfits and straw hats.

During
 the service, the couple exchanged 18-carat white gold platinum rings by
 Cartier, with Princess Charlene laughing as she placed the ring on her 
husband's finger.

After the mass, the couple went to 
the nearby Sainte Devote Church to lay down her bridal bouquet in the 
tradition in honour of the Patroness of Monaco.

As the couple left the church, Princess Charlene was seen wiping away a tear as a choir sang.

The

world-class athletes streaming up the red carpet into the Prince’s 
Palace, with the British royal family represented by Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, Countess Of Wessex.

As guests made their way into the 
venue, photographers shouted at Czech supermodel Karolina Kurkova, 
dressed in a sober navy skirt suit, to strike a pose.

And
 the crowd of thousands of Monegasque citizens following the festivities
 on giant screens just outside the palace broke into cheers as French 
musician Jean Michelle Jarre swept by.

resided for centuries - include French President Nicolas Sarkozy, 
Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, U.S. soprano Renee Fleming and Armani, 
the Italian designer who made Charlene's wedding gown.

Louis XV restaurant in Monaco.

He has said freshly caught fish and vegetables grown on Albert's farm will be on the menu. A fireworks extravaganza will follow.

The couple was married in an intimate civil service on Friday inside the prince's palace.

Albert's
 sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie, were among several dozen 
guests at Friday's ceremony, which was held in the palace's sumptuous 
throne room where the prince's father, the late Rainier III, wed 
Hollywood legend Grace Kelly in 1956.

Time to celebrate: Princess Caroline of Hanover attended with her daughter Charlotte Casiraghi

Man for the job: Giorgio Armani - who designed Charlene's wedding gown, attended with his niece Roberta, as did Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld

The blonde beauty died in a car crash
 nearly 30 years ago, and this tiny principality on the Riviera has been
 without a princess ever since.

Known
 as a notorious ladies man, 53-year-old Albert long eschewed marriage, 
and many Monegasques had resigned themselves to forever having a 
bachelor prince.

The constitution was even modified to ensure the continuity of the Grimaldi line, one of Europe's oldest dynasties, in case Albert never produced an heir.

The prince acknowledged having 
fathered two children out of wedlock, but only his legitimate offspring 
would be able to succeed him. Rumours have swirled in recent days that a
 third illegitimate child had surfaced - prompting Charlene to allegedly
 try to call off the wedding and return to South Africa days before the 
festivities.

Extravagant ceremony:  The religious ceremony of the Royal Wedding of Prince Albert II of Monaco to Charlene Wittstock was taking place in the main courtyard at Prince's Palace

The palace has denied the reports, dismissing them as ‘ugly rumours’ prompted by spite and jealousy.

Charlene, 33, has told interviewers she would like to have children.

Only
 Monaco's fewer than 8,000 citizens and their partners were allowed 
access to the Rocher, the rocky promontory presided over by the palace, 
to follow Saturday's service on two giant screens.

Several thousands of Monegasques came out for the civil ceremony a day earlier, many of them sporting dark suits or evening gowns and heels despite the scorching temperatures.

One of the attendees, 72-year-old Marie Malghreli, was still glowing from her family's brush with royalty.

‘My husband last night touched the prince's hand and then the princess touched my husband's hand - my husband was touched - and I was standing next to him and I was jealous,’ she said. ‘She is really pretty, she's delicious.’

Charlene was wearing a blue, ankle-length ensemble press handlers said was designed by the princess herself.
