A man doused his body with gasoline and set himself on fire in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City this morning, officials said.

The motive behind the self-immolation is not yet known, except that the unnamed man carried a piece of paper with the phone number of his daughter.

The 51-year-old man was ablaze in the square when a passing Jesuit priest ran to his aid to smother the flames with a jacket.

Self harm: The man entered the square after 8am this morning, carrying his daughter's phone number on a piece of paper, before setting himself on fire

The priest was later joined by two police officers who used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze.

The
 unnamed man was treated at a nearby hospital and transferred to a 
larger one, with serious burns to the upper part of his body.

The police officers were treated at the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries to their hands.

The attack took place the day after Pope Francis held his final public audience of the year in St Peter's Square.

Helping hand: The man is conscious and covered in a jacket following the self-immolation, before being taken to hospital

Out of danger: The man in St Peter's square after the fire was extinguished by a Jesuit priest and two policemen, surrounded by witnesses

Questionmarks: It is not clear why the man set himself on fire in St Peter's Square

Saved: The man was covered up before taken to hospital along the two police officers who put out the fire on his body

Saving grace: The man had to be taken to hospital near the Vatican to receive treatment to severe burns on his upper body

Thursday morning's scene was in stark 
contrast to the joyful scenes the day before where thousands gathered to
 greet the Pope the day after his birthday.

The mass capped off a year of renewed public popularity for the Catholic Church and the papacy, thanks to its new head.

Pope
 Francis has won over faiths and non-faiths alike since being elected in
 March to replace Pope Benedict and was selected as the Time Magazine 
Person of the Year.

Yesterday
 was a double celebration for Pope Francis, who turned 77 on Tuesday, as The 
Advocate, America's oldest gay rights magazine, chose him as the 'single
 most influential person of 2013 on the lives of LGBT people.'

Stark contrast: Pope Francis holds his final weekly audience of the year in a sunny St. Peter's Square on Wednesday
