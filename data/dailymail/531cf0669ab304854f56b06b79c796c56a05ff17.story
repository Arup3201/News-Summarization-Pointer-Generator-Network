The days where gaming was none other than a sedentary activity are long over. And perhaps no other title embodies this more than Nike+ Kinect Training.

For it is clear from the moment you’re thrust into the capable hands of one of the game’s PTs, that this is not a game, but a virtual gymnasium.

Upon selecting either a male or female instructor, you are first put through a basic fitness test to evaluate what needs to be improved. There are lots of modes, ranging from Challenge Drills, to five-minute sessions.

Clever: The Kinect tracks your movements and tells you when your form is starting to fail

Cleverly, the game can identify specific weaknesses - for example, if one side is stronger than the other - and then tailor workouts to suit your needs.

Working very much like an exercise class, the instructor first shows you a move, and then you repeat it a specific number of reps.

Cleverly, an avatar is shown on the screen to ensure that you can check your form. Exercises won’t start until you are in the correct position, too.

If your form dips, the instructor will tell you or hints will appear on the screen. Unfortunately, the latter means taking attention away from doing the actual exercise, which only acts as a constant reminder that you are, in fact, just playing a game.

This can also affect your total Fuel Print at the end of each workout, with some likely to find the inevitable and unavoidable loss of points a slight annoyance.

At the end, workout data is saved and can be tracked on graph, or sent to central Nike+ servers for a breakdown of Fuel across platforms.

Visually, although clearly not a game concerned with cutting-edge graphics, it's nevertheless impressive.

Menus are clear and easy to navigate, and environments varied. But the real technological achievement comes through its integration with the Kinect.

Although not perfect, the IR tracking performs well most of the time, showcasing just how far games in this genre have come since Wii Fit.

Varied: You won't just be stuck in a gym. The game takes you out in the open sometimes to keep things fresh

Although it maps out your room, taking into account large furniture, you may find that space is an issue with some of the more dynamic exercises. Indeed, to get the most from this game you need an open space.

If motivation is lacking, there is a Group Training section. This allows you to work out with a friend, or challenge other Nike+ users from around the world.

In theory, it works brilliantly, but given that Halo 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 are released this month, a large amount of users may look elsewhere for multiplayer options.

Overall, a well-balanced, solid game that will get you fitter from the comfort of your living room.
