Jose Mourinho fired a warning to his Premier League rivals last night by insisting his Chelsea team can dominate for the next 10 years.

After a summer of change at Stamford Bridge that has seen Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and David Luiz depart and £75million spent on Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis, the Portuguese manager believes he has a squad capable of recreating the continued success he enjoyed during his first spell in charge.

War cry: Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea can dominate the league for the next 10 years

Chelsea kick off their campaign at newly-promoted Burnley on Monday night and Mourinho is confident his players will respond to the challenge.

‘We have the squad that we want to have,’ he said. ‘It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So, I like my squad very much.’

On his way? Atletico Madrid have entered talks over World Cup winner Andre Schurrle

However, one player who may be leaving Chelsea is World Cup winner Andre Schurrle, with Atletico Madrid in talks over a potential deal for the Germany winger. The 23-year-old only joined Chelsea from Bayer Leverkusen last summer, for £18m, but has failed to hold down a regular first-team place. Mourinho, though, would prefer to sell other foreign players.
