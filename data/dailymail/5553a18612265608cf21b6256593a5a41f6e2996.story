Courtroom riot: TV's Judge Joe Brown was tossed in jail Monday for inciting the crowd in a Memphis juvenile courtroom

Former TV Judge Joe Brown, who was jailed on a contempt of court charge issued by a Tennessee juvenile judge on Monday, is a free man once again.

Brown, 66, was sentenced to five days in jail after he worked the courtroom into a froth as he questioned the authority of Magistrate Harold Horne while he was there representing a client in a child support case.

'He all but had that courtroom in a riot,' said Juvenile Court Chief Magistrate Dan Michael.

But later on Monday a lawyer for Brown went before another court and found that judge was more lenient, the former TV judge was then released on his own recognizance, reports WMC-TV.

Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket.

He was booked into the Shelby County jail in Memphis Monday afternoon. According to the Shelby County Sheriff's Office, Judge Beasley signed an order releasing Brown on Monday evening.

'This is politically motivated,' said Brown on his release. '[The woman I represented has] been going through this for eight years. There was no date of birth, no names, no birth certificate. She doesn't know who the devil they're talking about.'

On his release from jail on Monday evening, Brown claimed that the charges against him had been 'politically motivated'

Brown was Shelby County Criminal Court judge for 10 years before leaving the bench in 2000 to focus on his then two-year-old nationally syndicated television show. The show got canceled last year.

Earlier this year he turned in a petition to run for the Democratic nomination in the race for Shelby County's district attorney.

According to WREG, the fight was sparked after Brown was told there was no record of the case he was there to plead.

In audio taken during the heated exchange, Brown becomes progressively angrier as the magistrate schedules a court date in April for his client.

'He then began a diatribe against Mr Horne and the authority of the court,' Michael said.

'You want to get in to this, let's get into this, this sorry operation needs to stop!' Brown yells at the magistrate in audio taken from the scene.

Horne had 
Brown removed and gave him a day in jail, but Brown began to scream ever
 louder as he was dragged away and it won him four more days.

Brown repeatedly berates the magistrate and insists he lacks the authority to send him to jail.

'Ten dollars, that's all you got,' the audibly shaken former TV star tells the magistrate. 'I looked it up!'

The
 shocking outburst had some wondering if Brown's behavior has something 
to do with an old grudge from his days as a Shelby County Criminal Court
 judge or possibly his run for office.

On the theory about bad blood from his days on the bench, Juvenile Court Judge Curtis Person denied that Brown had been deliberately targeted.

'We will not allow anyone to act contemptuous towards this court. Heâ€™s just like everybody else.,' he said.

But asked about the possibility that it was all a stunt to win votes, Chief Magistrate Michael said only:

'Within
 five minutes there were three or four different attorneys down here 
seeking to represent him. You can draw whatever conclusion you want to 
draw.'
