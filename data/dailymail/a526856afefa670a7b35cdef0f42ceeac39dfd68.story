This man has starred in more Hollywood blockbusters than your favourite A lister - but you've never seen his face, until now.

Colin Follenweider has built a career performing the stunts too dangerous for the actors - and is paid to make the actions of film heroes a reality - making him Hollywood's most in-demand stuntman.

The 38-year-old from Los Angeles, California, has appeared in giant film franchises including Die Hard, X- Men, Iron Man, Avatar, Transformers and Spider Man.

During the filming of Spider-Man 3, Colin was pulled behind the camera truck on a 4x8 sheet of plywood. In the picture - taken in Cleveland - he is discussing the next shot

The stuntman spends his working day on locations all over the world getting hit by cars, punched in fights, thrown into walls and flying around on wires - and he loves every minute of it.

Colin said: ‘Every stunt man needs to know how to take a punch and fall down, get hit by a car, fall down some steps, that's what we do every day.

‘If you're smashing through glass, you're always going to get cut, hurt, banged up - if you're going to get hit by a car, despite the training, you're still getting hit by a car, and that hurts.

‘Stuntmen are there for situations which are too dangerous for the actor, ultimately we're expendable where the lead in a film isn't.’

Colin was a gymnast at school and has used his athleticism and training to become a regular in massive block-buster movies.

As a 19-year-old, Colin started performing in live stunt shows before moving on to Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas.

His first appearence on the big screen was in Princess Diaries Two where he hada tiny part as a soldier being knocked out the way by a horse - and since then Colin has played a part in a multitude of films and television series. He has 68 stunt credits to his name on IMDB.

Colin said: ‘I'm a gymnast so I specialise in aerials and wire work but I love parkour and free running, it's important to do it right and do it convincingly for the movie.

‘My biggest job was Spider Man Three. I loved flying around the city on wires and being thrown from explosions.’

'A lot of our job is also training the actors we work with, the more of their own stunts they can do, the better for the visual authenticity of the film.

‘Some actors have never taken a punch before, training them so they're up to scratch in a fight scene is essential, so the scene looks good.’

Although some action scenes take place on the green screen, Colin has travelled to film sets all over the world.

He said: ‘I spent four months in Puerto Rico working on a film called The Losers where I doubled Chris Evans and Oscar Canada, the weather was beautiful and I couldn't believe how lucky I was.

‘I also doubled Shia LaBeouf in a film called Eagle Eye and was chased by Billy Bob Thornton through an airport.

‘We spent two weeks jumping on conveyer belts in a ship yard. It was like an adult version of snakes and ladders - it was so much fun and looked incredible on film.’
