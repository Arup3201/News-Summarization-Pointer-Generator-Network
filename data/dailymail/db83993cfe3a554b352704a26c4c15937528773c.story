Andros Townsend has taken advantage of Tottenham's fourth round exit from the FA Cup by jetting out to Dubai with his girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan.

The 23-year-old's girlfriend uploaded a picture of herself alongside the Tottenham winger with the caption, 'Dinner with my boy on our last night in Dubai'.

Townsend was allowed to soak up the rays in Dubai with O'Sullivan over the weekend due to Tottenham's elimination from the FA Cup  on January 24.

The England international previously showed his support to O'Sullivan during the World Darts Championship back in December. 

O'Sullivan, who also posted a snap of herself in the sea, was one of the walk on girls during the London event at Alexandra Palace.

Meanwhile, Townsend will be hoping to face Fiorentina in the Europa League on Thursday.

Tottenham face the Italian outfit at White Hart Lane in the first leg of their two-legged Round of 32 tie.
