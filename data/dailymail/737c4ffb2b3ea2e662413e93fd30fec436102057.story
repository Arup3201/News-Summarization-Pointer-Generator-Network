Nico Rosberg is facing a five-place grid penalty for Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix after suffering a gearbox failure in final practice.

Rosberg, 29 points ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the battle for the drivers’ championship, sat out the majority of the morning session with the issue and failed to post a competitive time.

In contrast, team-mate Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend ahead of qualifying later on Saturday.

Mercedes mechanics worked on Rosberg’s car during the session, and are said to be hopeful they won’t have to replace the gearbox unit and escape a subsequent penalty. 

Hamilton, who hasn’t started from pole since May’s Spanish Grand Prix, is desperate to close the gap to Rosberg with only seven races remaining.

'I can't leave Monza without points, but I've felt the same thing for the last seven races,'he said. 

'Hopefully this weekend the brakes won't go. You never know what is going to happen, it's scary not knowing what is ahead of you.

'But I'll just continue to race the way I do. I've always raced hard and I feel that is what I've been hired to do.

'That's what I've done since I was a kid, and it is what has got me to where I am, so I don't see anything has changed in that respect.

'I feel it's important for me not to change. The team have hired me to win the championship, to get them as many points as possible and to bring the car home.

'I have generally been doing that every race. If you look at my 150-odd races, I have brought it home in a large portion of those. That's what I do, and that's what I plan to do moving forwards.'
