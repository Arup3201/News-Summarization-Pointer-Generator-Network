Security guards had to rescue a family of dogs who became stranded on a 590ft-high glass bridge in China.

The group, including several puppies, became spooked when crossing part of the bridge that has glass panels covering the floor.

It is understood the animals followed tourists onto the suspension bridge at the famous Shiniuzhai Scenic Spot.

The move made the bridge a popular tourist attraction but it proved too much for the dogs who were too afraid to cross over the glass.

Security guard Xiong Yin, 35, said: ‘Some of the dogs did not seem to mind but the rest refused to step on the glass.

‘There was a risk that the dogs that were all very small might fall, and so we decided to remove them.

‘They were very popular with tourists that had been posing for pictures with them. But it was dangerous.’

He added that usually dogs and other animals avoided the bridge, but he believed these dogs had followed a small group of tourists that had been feeding them, and had hoped to get more food later by keeping behind the visitors.

The bridge is one of the most famous sights in the scenic spot in China's Hunan province.

At 300-metres-long and 180-metres-high, it is one of the world’s highest.

It was earlier this year that the glass floor was installed, with more expected to be added across the whole bridge next year.

The towering rock formations have become extremely popular with tourists and in addition to the bridge, a cable car was installed in 2009 as well as hundreds of meters of cliffwalks.

It was in 2012 that tightrope walker Aisikaier fell as he was attempting a 600-meter long route across the valley walking backwards with a blindfold on.

Strong winds caused him to lose his balance just 40 meters from the end of the rope, but his fall was broken by trees and he escaped without injury.
