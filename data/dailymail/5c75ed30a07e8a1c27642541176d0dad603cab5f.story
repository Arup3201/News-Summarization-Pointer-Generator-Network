Mike Holpin, a  recovering alcoholic from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, has an unusual way of keeping track of his children.

With 22 that carry his last name, 18 who don't and 'probably a few more', Mr Holpin is one of the UK's most prolific fathers with offspring aged between 37 and three.

To keep track of all his children, who were born to 20 different mothers, he has had their names tattooed across his back.

Prolific: Mike Holpin, 56, has 40 children with 20 different women but thinks he may have more

Although he insists that he loves all of his children, Mr Holpin is no longer in touch with some, while others were removed by social services thanks to his alcoholism and womanising.

Nevertheless, he says he is a changed character who wants nothing more than to reunite his vast brood - and would like to add a few more if he can.

'I'm as fertile as sin,' he explains. 'I don't believe in contraception and I love sex.'

According to Mr Holpin, his first sexual experience came aged nine but his baby-making career didn't really get underway until he got a job at a fairground in his late teens.

'Boys working on rides like that, they're only there for one reason and that's to pull women,' he reminisces. 'Good looking boys are better but funny boys are spectacular. 

'You have to do some manoeuvring but me, I thought, I just want sex. I'd pat them on the rump and if they say f*** off then they're not really up for it. If they say yes, then great.'

Taken: Because of his alcoholism, many of his children were taken by social services and grew up in care

Although Mr Holpin has had many girlfriends, he admits to having had only six serious relationships, all of which fell victim to his ongoing battle with alcohol.

His children too have suffered because of his alcoholism, with nearly all being taken into care as a result.

It is, says Mr Holpin, his biggest regret. 'Due to my drinking and my womanising, most of my kids have gone through the care system,' he explains.

'It makes me feel like s*** because they've suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I'm an alcoholic. I'm still an alcoholic - I just don't practise it.'

Now the reformed character is hoping to reunite his huge brood and fulfil the promise he made to each child as they were removed.

'When they went into care, I made a promise that no matter how long it took, I will get my kids home,' he says.

Perfect: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect

Adding: He hopes to add to his family, aged between 37 and three, in the future

'I miss all the fun we used to have so I guess getting them back, my life will be set. My life will be perfect.'

Mr Holpin also says he would like to add to his family with the help of his fiancée Diane but can't resist reminiscing about the pulling techniques he used in the past.

'There's nothing nicer than a single fellow with a baby,' he smirks. 'Sex? It's sex is all it is.  You could look like the back of a bus but sex is sex. You do doggy style if she's ugly.

'I'm only 56,' he continues. 'I'll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I'm doing what God wants.' 

Now, he says, he is a reformed character. 'I've got so much love in me for my kids, it's spilling over,' he says. 'I need them more than they need me to be honest. I can't be without them.'

He also says he hopes his children will be able to forgive him, both for their upbringing in care and for his lengthy reproductive career.

'I can't make up for what I've done,' he admits. 'All I can do is be there for them now. I'll keep fighting.'
