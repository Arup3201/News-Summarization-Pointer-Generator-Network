President Barack Obama has named executives from Google and Twitter to two key positions on his technology policy team on Thursday.

The White House says Megan Smith will serve as chief technology officer in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, while Alexander Macgillivray, formerly of Twitter, will be her deputy.

Smith was vice president of the Google X lab that worked on projects like driverless cars and Google Glass eyewear, and led acquisitions for the company like Picasa and Google Maps.

Macgillivray most recently was general counsel and head of public policy at Twitter.

Smith replaces Todd Park, who started two successful health technology companies before joining the government. Park recently returned to California, but continues to work for the administration, recruiting tech experts into the government.

Macgillivray replaces Nicole Wong, who left the White House last month.

Wong had been legal director at Twitter and a former Google lawyer before she joined the White House, and helped lead the recent White House review of big data and privacy issues.
