After their numbers came in to make them £161million richer, Britain's biggest EuroMillions lottery winners declared they were going to have 'so much fun'.

And almost twelve months later, Colin and Christine Weir are still doing just that - by spending some of their fortune on a luxury indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi.

The couple want to build the improvements to their £850,000 mansion in Largs, Ayrshire, which they bought with their winnings last year.

Lavish: Colin and Christine Weir have submitted plans for a raft of improvements to their £850,000 mansion

Plans submitted to North Ayrshire Council show the project will feature a full-size swimming pool, a spa pool, changing rooms with shower facilities, a plant room and airing cupboard.

The pool room will be connected to the main house through a new hallway and include Roman-style ornamental statues

Colin, 64, a former Scottish Television cameraman, and his wife Chris, 56, have also applied to build another, more traditional, conservatory at the side of the house with a balcony on top.

The property already has a cinema and stables, and it emerged last month that proposals for a luxury greenhouse, featuring automatic lights and rain sensors, had been submitted to the council.

Neighbours have been invited to view the new plans, and Historic Scotland is also likely to be consulted as the mansion is a listed building.

The couple, who have been married for more than 30 years, have hired York-based firm Oak Leaf Conservatories to carry out the work.

A source said: 'The plans show that the pool house and conservatory are going to be very luxurious.

'Colin and Chris have been in the new house for a while now and must feel it's time to put their own stamp on it.

'The project will cost a few quid but it's not as if they can't afford it.

Having fun: Colin and Chris Weir became Britain's biggest lottery winners when they scooped the £161million jackpot last July

'All the paperwork has been sent to the council's planning department and it is expected it will get approval barring any serious objections.'

The Weirs lived in a modest £180,000 three-bedroom home in Largs when they hit the jackpot in July last year.

They said they visited their local chippy three times a week and drank Coke and Irn-Bru, but the big win put a champagne lifestyle within their grasp in an instant.

Things didn't go smoothly at first, as the couple went to Spain after receiving letters from hundreds of people begging them for cash.

The way they were: The couple lived in a modest three-bedroom house before their jackpot win. They gifted the property to a neighbour after they bought the mansion

But the couple soon showed their generosity, gifting their old home to a neighbour after they bought the mansion last September.

They are sponsoring 15-year-old Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsay in his first season competing in European and Italian Formula Three events.

Earlier this month it emerged that Mr Weir had pledged to give £750,000 to his local football team, Largs Thistle, to help them clear debts and improve their facilities.

And the couple made a seven-figure donation to the Scottish National Party to support its campaign for Scotland to break away from the rest of the UK.

Mr Weir is a lifelong supporter of the SNP and stood as the party’s candidate in Ayr at the 1987 General Election – coming fourth in the poll.
