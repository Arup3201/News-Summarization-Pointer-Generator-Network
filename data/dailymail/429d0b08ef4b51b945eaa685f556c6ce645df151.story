Tottenham are edging closer to agreeing a groundshare with MK Dons while work is carried out on their new stadium and are also considering the prospect of playing up to three Premier League games at Wembley.

Spurs have held formal talks with the League One outfit about the possibility of fulfilling their 2017-18 season fixtures in Milton Keynes. The stadium is almost 50 miles away from White Hart Lane but has good road and rail links from London.

Sportsmail understands discussions between club officials were positive as Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy moves nearer to securing a temporary home, when building work means they cannot play at their current ground.

Tottenham are edging closer to agreeing a groundshare with MK Dons following positive talks with the club

The north London club will need to move out of their current White Hart Lane stadium for the 2017-18 season

Spurs will be moving 48.3 miles away but stadium:mk does have good road and railway links from London

Spurs could also play  three matches at Wembley Stadium with a maximum of 37 events allowed per year

Tottenham and MK Dons wouldn't be the first to find reasonable success with ground sharing.

Fulham and QPR: The west London clubs shared Loftus Road for two season between 2002 and 2004 while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped.

Crystal Palace and Charlton/Crystal Palace and Wimbledon: Crystal Palace shared Selhurst Park with Charlton between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to Wimbledon until their extinction in 2003

AC Milan and Inter: Both called the San Siro home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two Milan teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them.

West Ham made it clear they would not enter into negotiations with their rivals over the use of the Olympic Stadium, and backlash from supporters surrounding a move to Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium would prove to be too great.

Any deal struck with Wembley would be dependent on the limitations imposed by Brent Council, with a maximum of 37 events per year currently allowed.

Tottenham would have to seek permission from the Premier League if they were to seal a contract with MK Dons and the national stadium but there are no rules preventing clubs from playing in two separate locations during a campaign.

The club have confirmed they will move away from their current home for one season when work finally begins on their 56,000-capacity ground as part of the Northumberland Development Project.

Given stadium:mk holds 30,500 - just six thousand fewer than White Hart Lane - it would represent an agreeable arrangement for Tottenham. The venue will host a Rugby World Cup game next year and Spurs were impressed with the facilities during the televised Capital One Cup win against Manchester United in August.

Levy still remains at loggerheads with a local business in north London - Archway Sheet Metal Works - over one piece of land on the site for the new stadium. If that is resolved, Tottenham can press ahead with plans to relocate to Milton Keynes.

A Tottenham spokesman said: ‘As we have said, we will not be commenting on speculation concerning any individual venues and continue to explore all options.’
