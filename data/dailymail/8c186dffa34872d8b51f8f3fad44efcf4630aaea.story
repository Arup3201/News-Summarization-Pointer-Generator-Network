The prime minister of Belgium was today bombarded with one of his country’s national dishes – chips and mayonnaise.

Charles Michel was attacked by activists protesting against austerity measures imposed by the European Union.

The 39-year-old, who is the youngest premier in his country’s history, was about to make a speech in Namur, in the southern Wallonia region of Belgium, when he was covered in the gooey mess.

Bombarded: An activist squirts mayonnaise all over Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel today as he was about to make a speech in Namur, in the southern Wallonia region of Belgium

‘Four women posing as students jumped out and started covering him in mayonnaise,’ said one onlooker.

‘Chips were also flying towards his head. His security guards looked very worried, but he seemed to take it all in his stride, smiling broadly.

’Chants of ‘Michel – release us from austerity’ could be heard, as the protesters said they were former members of the Femen women’s group.

All were dressed in black, and some wore masks, in the attack, which was broken up by the guards, who reported the protestors to police.

The young premier, who took office in October, leads a coalition that is planning major public sector cutbacks while also raise the retirement age in Belgium to 67.

After being covered in mayonnaise, he cleared himself up and carried on with his speech without his jacket. 

‘I felt like a bit of mayonnaise,’ he joked. 

Belgium often claims that chips originated in their country, where they are served with mayonnaise, but France disputes this, saying it invented ‘French fries’.
