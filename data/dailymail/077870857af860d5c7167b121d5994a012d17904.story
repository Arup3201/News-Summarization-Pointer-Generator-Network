England are on track to take on Brazil after enjoying a relaxing train journey to London today.

Roy Hodgson’s side, who face next year's World Cup hosts at a sold-out Wembley tomorrow, travelled by coach to Birmingham International rail station before boarding a Virgin Voyager service to the capital.

The England squad and their army of support
staff were, obviously, accommodated in first class, in carriages 
specially partitioned off from the public.

Once they had arrived in London, Hodgson confirmed that Ashley Cole will start the match in order to win his 100th cap. The Chelsea left-back will become only the seventh player to reach a century of caps for the Three Lions.

Asked if Cole would start, Hodgson told reporters: 'Yes he will. He'll start the game, then I'll have to see what to do with Leighton (Baines), who has been doing very well. Ashley will definitely start.'

Centre of attention: Ashley Cole, speaking to Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere, will claim his 100th cap against Brazil tomorrow

Hodgson did, however, rule out the possibility of Cole leading the side out at Wembley tomorrow in place of captain Gerrard, who made his 100th appearance for England in last November's friendly with Sweden.

Hodgson said: 'I don't see any reason why the captain should let anyone else lead the team out. 'Ashley does his talking and work on the field and I don't think he's ever pushed himself forward during his 100 appearances as a potential captain of the team.

'I think he's just very happy to be a key player in the team so I'm pretty certain he won't be trying to rip the armband off Steven tomorrow.'

Gerrard agreed that Cole should now be considered an all-time great. 'I think he deserves to be in there,' he told Sky Sports News. 'I look at the players I played with throughout my career and I think he's been one of the most consistent.'

Tributes: Gerrard and Hodgson lavished praised on Cole ahead of his 100th cap

What you been listening to then, lad? Leighton Baines and Gary Neville may have discussed the latest Indie tunes - but we're not sure about Frank Lampard's choice (left)

On the platform, Arsenal’s 19-year-old forward Alex 
Oxlade-Chamberlain carried a pillow – not because he was expecting to be
bored by team-mate Theo Walcott’s conversation but because footballers
carry their own pillows to minimise the risk of infection.

It’s those small margins that make a difference at elite level.

The squad, who normally stay at the 
Grove outside Watford, were heading for their central London hotel, the 
Churchill on Portman Square, with the delights of Oxford Street around 
the corner.

England will take a matchday stroll 
in the Mayfair neighbourhood tomorrow, as exclusively revealed in 
Charles Sale’s Sports Agenda column last week, although a walk down one 
of the world's best-known shopping thoroughfares might be a step too far
in embracing city living - as they want to do at Brazil 2014 with a 
base in Rio.

Sir Bobby Charlton will welcome the 
squad at Wembley as the former Manchester United star will be part of 
the ceremony before the game, which falls on the 55th anniversary of the
Munich air disaster.

There will be a moment of silence 
before kick-off in memory of those who died in Munich and to remember 
those killed last month in the Brazilian nightclub tragedy.

Pele had agreed to attend as guest of honour at what is the first friendly of the FA’s 150th 
anniversary year but has been forced to pull out due to a recent hip 
operation.

The Brazilian legend originally hoped to be over the effects of the surgery but has been advised against travelling.

The referee for tomorrow’s match will
be Pedro Proenca, who took charge of Chelsea’s Champions League triumph 
over Bayern Munich last season. He also refereed the Euro 2012 final.
