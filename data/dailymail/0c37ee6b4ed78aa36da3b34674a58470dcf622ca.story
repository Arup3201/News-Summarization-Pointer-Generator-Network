A group of Iranian dancers who were arrested for making a 'vulgar clip' to Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy have been released on bail.

The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran tweeted Wednesday morning that everyone who featured in the video, that Iranian authorities claimed 'hurt public chastity,' has been let go, though its director is still being held.

One of the dancers, fashion photographer Reihane Taravati, has also posted a photograph on Instagram with the caption: 'Hi, I'm back. Thanks you @pharrell and everyone who cared about us love you all so much and missed you so much.'

Freed: A group of Iranian dancers arrested for making a 'vulgar clip' to Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy have been released on bail. One of the dancers, fashion photographer Reihane Taravati, has also posted a photograph on Instagram with the caption: 'Hi, I'm back'

The friends were arrested on Tuesday after police took offense at the video, which shows three men and three unveiled women dancing in the streets and on the rooftops of Tehran.

Williams protested the arrests on Facebook, posting: 'It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.'

This sparked the creation of the Twitter hashtag #freehappyiranians and finally Iranian authorities caved to the pressure. It's not clear how much longer the director will be detained.

The video titled 'Happy in Tehran' features the group dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world.

But after the video hit YouTube and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of Western news sites like the Huffington Post, authorities hunted down its stars, interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail.

Sad: These six young residents of Tehran have been arrested for remaking Pharrell's feel good hit video Happy

Pharrell responded to the shocking arrest late Tuesday in a tweet expressing is dismay

'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia according to the ISNA news agency.

By Tuesday night, the Grammy award winning singer had weighed in on the controversy.

'It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,' Pharrell tweeted, with a link to a New York Times blog story about the arrests.

The arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered Islamic authorities.

'Following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary, all the suspects were identified and arrested,' said Sajedinia.

The Iranians' rendition of the hit angered authorities who seemed to fear it was evidence of a new generation casting aside the old Islamic lifestyle for Western ideals (a still from the remake is at left, with Pharrell at right)

Islamic law requires women to cover their heads in public. Authorities called the video 'vulgar'

Their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions. Sajedinia said they 'confessed to their criminal acts.'

Islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public. The video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on Tehran rooftops, sans headress.

The move comes a perplexing time since just recently Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke publicly in support of loosening the state's cencorship of the internet.

'We ought to see (the Internet) as an opportunity. We must recognise our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web,' said Rouhani according to the official IRNA news agency.

The young people were publicly shamed as their interrogation was aired on Iranian television along with clips of their video

'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia

'Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner, grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword, lest we take a bullet in this culture war?' he said in his weekend speech.

In a interview with IranWire last month prior to the arrests, one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of Iran and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere.

'Despite all the pressures and limitations,' she said, 'young people are joyful and want to make the situation better. They know how to have fun, like the rest of the world.'
