At first glance, they look like elaborately-patterned tea cosies.

But these wooly designs are actually adorable outfits for tortoises - and are flying off the creators knitting needles.

Tortoise-lover Katie Bradley started crocheting the outfits for her seven pet tortoises as a family joke.

Tortoise-lover Katie Bradley started crocheting wooly designs - including these dinosaur outfits - for her seven pet tortoises as a family joke

Found under the pumpkin patch! After posting pictures of the cosy designs on her tortoise blog, she was soon inundated with requests to make them for tortoises around the globe

Firestarter! Katie, from Vancouver, Canada, said: 'My first cozy started out as a fun little joke. I came across a picture of a tortoise with a doily on its shell, and had a good laugh'

Katie has seven tortoises and says she loves their 'wise eyes' and how no one is frightened of them

But after posting pictures of the cosy outfits on her tortoise blog, she was soon inundated with requests to make them for tortoises around the globe.

And now tortoises around the world are being decked out dressed as sharks, pumpkins - or just in pretty patterns.

Katie, from Vancouver, Canada, said: 'My first cozy started out as a fun little joke. I came across a picture of a tortoise with a doily on its shell, and had a good laugh.

'I decided to take it a step further, and crocheted a few little cozies in simple designs, tried them on my tortoises, and took pictures.

Don't go into the water! The wacky designs range from vegetables to great white shark outfits

It takes roughly up to 40 minutes to create each suit, which are now sold on Katie's online Etsy shop

'I posted pictures on my tortoise blog and shared them on one of the tortoise forums, and very quickly, they became popular.

'I started getting requests to make them to sell, so I listed some in my tortoise-themed Etsy shop. They started selling as fast as I could make them, so I just kept making more.

'I enjoy coming up with different designs, and have a few more up my sleeve that I haven't started making yet.

'I found that they were really handy for spotting the tortoises quickly when I had let them out in the garden - I can see where they are immediately.'

Mother-of-two Katie, 36, has seven tortoises - but has had to take to taking her yarn and crochet hooks wherever she goes, to fill every spare moment with knitting the creations.

She added: 'If I can work without interruption, it takes roughly up to 40 minutes to create each suit, depending on the design.

'I love treating my pets. I rescued three of my tortoises, one of them, Norbert, was forgotten in a barn stall and wasn't given food or water for six months before he came into my care.

'Some creature had bitten his feet, and he was terribly ill. Yet, with proper care, food, water and warmth, he is now a happy, healthy little fella who will likely live for another 100 years.

'Tortoises are living fossils, they have survived since around the time of dinosaurs. Some say they have been around for more than 400 million years! It never ceases to amaze me how tough and well-adjusted to their environment they are.

'Their wise old eyes will follow you around with such interest when you are within view of the enclosure. I have yet to meet a person who is afraid of a tortoise, which can't be said of most reptiles.'
