Tasmania's speedy teenager has done it again; after smashing the country's 100m under-18's record in September, Jack Hale has come up with a new jaw-dropping record.

The 16-year-old scooped up a gold medal at the All Schools Track and Field Championships in Adelaide on Saturday, sprinting 100 metres in 10.13 seconds.

Although a 3.4 metre per second tailwind meant Hale couldn't claim the time as a new record, the time was the fastest run by any Australian this year, regardless of wind.

Jack Hale, 16, took out gold in the 100m under 18's event at the All Schools Track and Field Championships in Adelaide on Saturday

When compared to Australia’s fastest ever sprinter, Patrick Johnson, whose fastest time was 9.93 in 2003, the difference is a matter of milliseconds – 0.2 to be exact.

But the 16-year-old is also not too far off the standard set by world champions of the likes of Usain Bolt, who’s all-time fastest in the 100 metre sprint remains 9.58, achieved at Berlin in 2009.

His time was also less than half a second slower than favourites such as Carl Lewis and Linford Christies, whose fastest times remain 9.86 and 9.87 respectively. 

Hale, who was already ranked 1st in Australia's youth and ranked 6th in the world by the International Association of Athletics Federations for his 10.42 second run in October, told Fairfax that although he was happy with his new time, he'd prefer to have achieved it legally.

'It was a strong wind but hopefully I can go somewhere near that with a legal 2.0 … I have to do it legally then I'll be happy,' he said.

'I am extremely pumped. The start was horrible; it's the first time very I have had someone to chase down which makes me happy and pushed me to a lot quicker time.'

Running neck-to neck with his competitor Rohan Browning in the first 60- metres or so, it wasn't until the last moment that Hale threw himself over the line first, with only 0.05 seconds to spare before Browning came second.

The teen has been set as Australia's next big hope at the Olympics since September when he first smashed the country's 100m under-18 record by running 100 metres in 10.44 seconds at a race meet in Hobart.

The crowd watched on in amazement as a star was born on the track when Hale, who until this year only competed in long jump, also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record.

Hale's running time has also been compared to the personal bests of world champions such as Jamaica's Usain Bolt and USA's Carl Lewis

Hale, who was until recently a long jump specialist, says he has set his sights high in the sprinting arena.

'At the moment I'm not extremely serious about it, but in the future if I keep improving I'll definitely want to take it to the Olympics with a gold medal,' he told ABC.

Hale's trainers were also impressed with his amazing performance calling it 'sensational' and 'beyond what we were expecting'.

Brian Rowe, from Athletics Tasmania, told ABC Hale was already 'very talented' for achieving such a great time so early on in the season.

'A young fellow, 16-year-old, comes out of the winter, does a bit of winter training for the first time, already very talented, and is more than capable, although 10:44 is a bit beyond what everyone was expecting.

'To achieve that so early in the season, at what many would say were the school sports, is absolutely astounding, and an outstanding performance by a young man who has only been known as a long jumper.

Hale is part of a new crop of talent, some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in Oregon.

The Tasmanian Institute of Sport had supported young athletes who were able to access training tracks around the clock.
