The police charged the woman who crashed into a car driven by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's mother with driving under the influence on Monday.

The head on collision happened on August 2 in Clermont, Florida, but Dwayne, 42, only revealed the details on Sunday.

The women jumped two red lights as she was chased by the police, according to TMZ.

Not happy: The Rock, seen in July promoting Hercules, said he is angry with the drunk driver who hit his family's car

The Hercules star's mother, Ata Naivia-Johnson was returning from a charity event with his cousin, Savelina 'Lina' Fanene, a WWE Diva.

The Lake County Sheriff's Department explained the accident happened just minutes after police started following the intoxicated driver.

Johnson, whose pro-wrestling name is The
 Rock, shared a scary looking photo on Sunday of the wreckage which 
included two white cars smashed in the front with an ambulance in the 
background.

'My
 mom & cousin...were struck head on by a drunk driver this week - 
they lived,' he captioned the post. 'First reaction is to find the 
person who did this and do unrelenting harm to them.'

The Fast & Furious 6 actor then added, 'But
 then you realize the most important thing is my family lived thru this 
and we can hug each other that much tighter these days.'

He also wrote, 'Hug your own family tighter today and be grateful you can tell them you love them.'

Ata and Savelina were in the white 2012 Cadillac Escalade the star gave his mother for Christmas in 2012.

The drunk driver 'suffered facial injuries and was taken to the hospital,' the site added.

Savelina posted a photo of The Rock visiting her in the hospital.

Without any makeup on and wearing prescription glasses, the beauty was almost unrecognizable.

She pulled a funny face as she sat in her hospital bed.

Dwayne has had a busy year.

He not only promoted his big swords-and-sandals epic Hercules, but he recently completed shooting Fast & Furious 7 opposite Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel.

He also shot San Andreas, about the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California; The Rock plays a rescue helicopter pilot in search of his daughter.

San Andreas is a major fault line in California.

The star appeared on the cover of UFC magazine's September edition and to celebrate shared an Instagram photo of himself topless while holding the issue.
