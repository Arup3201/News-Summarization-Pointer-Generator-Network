As Albert Einstein once said, time only exists 'so that everything doesn't happen at once'.

But the problem of it passing too slowly or quickly has now been examined by a psychologist who looked at how our emotions, health and age can dictate the speed of the day in our minds.

BBC Radio 4 broadcaster Claudia Hammond found that time - the most common noun in the English language - speeds up as you get older and passes faster if you are relaxed rather than scared.

Her book, Time Warped, available from Canongate Books in paperback at Â£8.99, also explains how time passes twice as fast if you are in amusing company, rather than with someone who is boring.

She looked at how time dramatically expands in a near-death situation - using the example of BBC journalist Alan Johnston, who was taken hostage in Gaza in 2007 and released four months later.

The psychologist also studied French explorer Michel Siffre, who in 1962 spent two months living in an underground cave to discover how isolation from daylight, clocks and routines would affect him.

He completely lost track of time while in the cave and his waking days lasted from six to 40 hours, but the average length was around the same time as the length of a day on Earth - 24 hours.

Ms Hammond also studied how fear or hearing somebody cry can slow down time, and said that half of people believe time is moving towards us, while everyone else sees themselves moving through it.

People always believe they will have more free time in the future, she said, adding that there are plenty of practical methods for ensuring we can try our best to accurately estimate our schedules.

But while we may spend much of our lives worrying about time, there is surprisingly no single part of the brain for specifically measuring the passing of minutes and hours, Ms Hammond revealed.

Human beings instead tend to process events in three-second intervals - representing how long it takes to complete a handshake or the rhythm of speech - and sync this with clock times, she said.
