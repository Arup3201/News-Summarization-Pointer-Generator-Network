Mayim Bialik rose to fame through her television
portrayal of a free-spirited teenager named Blossom and it seems her character's
personality traits are now mirrored in her own life.

The actress, who played the lead role in Eighties American
sitcom Blossom, has written a parenting book titled Beyond The Sling: A Real-Life
Guide To Raising Confident, Loving Children The Attachment Parenting Way.

The 36-year-old, who now stars in The Big Bang Theory as the brainy Amy Farrah Fowler, details how she breastfeeds her three-and-a-half
year-old son Fred and how she and her husband allow him and older son Miles, six, to sleep on mattresses on the ground with them every
night.

Unconventional: Blossom star Mayim Bialik has a book about the attachment parenting method she has adopted. She has two sons, Fred, three and Miles, six

The Los Angeles-based star, who also has a PhD in neuroscience, follows the Attachment Parenting
method originally coined by Dr William
Sears, a U.S. pediatrician.

The unconventional technique also involves potty training without
diapers, a natural birth and wearing a baby in a sling to ensure they remain
physically close to a parent’s body.

Dr Bialik told Newsok.com: 'When we treat our children
kindly and expect love and give love, we hopefully are raising children that
then expect that and give that to the world around them.

'It is very consistent with a 'green' style of parenting.'

Role model: The actress' unusual technique involves breastfeeding until her kids are three and co-sleeping with her children on mattresses on the ground

She and her husband of eight years Mike Roosevelt, 36, live
in a one-bedroom house.

There is no playroom for their sons because the couple
do not believe in supplying their children with expensive toys.

Dr Bialik, who is a spokesperson for America’s Holistic
Moms Network, said: 'Our society's obsession with consumerism, especially in
the realm of baby things, baby soaps and baby products… that's something that
my husband and I, partly for frugality and partly for environmental reasons,
have really rejected.

New role: Dr Bialik currently stars as Amy on CBS's The Big Bang Theory

'We figure everything out without spending a lot of money on
that kind of stuff.'

She kept both of her children close to her person for many
of their first months by placing them in a sling across her body every day.

The $35 sling was used for both Miles and Fred, who were
kept laid down rather than upright to ensure the baby kept its natural shape.

The couple have also allowed their children to develop correct
toilet habits as soon as they realise their body’s natural signals.

Dr Bialik said in regards to diaper use: ‘You’re basically
training your child to use their pants as a bathroom and two years later we
have them turn around and do all sorts of complicated manipulations to get them
to unlearn.’

She added that she is motivated by a desire to be the best
parent she could possibly be.

‘Most of our life is centered around trying to be the parents
we want to be.’

The actress achieved her PhD in neuroscience in 2008.

She looked to her doctoral thesis while she was researching her new book.

She focused on the hormones of human attachment, which are often a big part in the emotional bond a parent forms with their child.
