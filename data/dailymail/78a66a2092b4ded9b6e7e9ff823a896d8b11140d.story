The Polar Vortex Part II is getting ready to roll back into town.

Leading meteorologists are warning the Mid-Atlantic is in for a repeat of last winter, which was noted as the 34th coldest such period for the contiguous 48 states as a whole since modern records began in 1895, according to weather.com.

Now, with a month-and-a-half left of fall, the forecasts are in, and another polar vortex looks set to hit the Northeast from January and not let up for months.

Accuweather are reporting that New York will again experience above-average snow and freezing temperatures, however neither is expect to hold out as long as the brutal winter of 2013/14.

'I think, primarily, we’ll see that happening in mid-January into February but again, it’s not going to be the same type of situation as we saw last year, not as persistent,' AccuWeather.com Expert Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok said.

Get ready: Winter will arrive without delay, according to Accuweather.com, with frigid air from another polar vortex seeping down into the country's midsection and Northeast as early as November

Here comes the snow: Meteorologists are predicting higher-than-normal snow totals for cities west of the I-95 corridor. Washington, D.C., Boston and New York will also be affected, and Philadelphia will be hit hard

Reprieve: In some good news for the Midwest, the area is expected to experience temperatures seven to nine degrees warmer than last year, with noticeably lighter snow forecast for Chicago and Minneapolis 

'The cold of last season was extreme because it was so persistent.

'We saw readings that we haven't seen in a long time: 15- to 20-below-zero readings.'

People in more than two dozen states from the Southeast to the Northeast felt last year's polar vortex - a weather phenomenon where frigid air breaks free from the North Pole and plunges south, according to News Mic.

This year higher-than-normal snow is predicted for cities west of the I-95 corridor, including Baltimore and Harrisburg.

Around 70 inches of snow is also expected to slam Philadelphia.

Washington, D.C., Boston and New York will also be affected.

For the rest of the country, Accuweather expressed concern for the area between Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast.

Warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which have not been cooled this year by a tropical cyclone, could provide extra fuel for winter storms in the south, according to MSN.

The region will experience a predominantly wet winter.

In some good news for the Midwest, the area is expected to experience temperatures seven to nine degrees warmer than last year.

This should be true for Duluth, Minnesota, and Green Bay, Wisconsin.

There are also predictions of below-normal snowfall.

Chicago and Minneapolis are especially not expected to get as much snow as previous years.

The northern and central Plains will endure roller-coaster temperatures, Accuweather said.

For the west coast, there is no suggestion the record-drought in California will worsen.

However, besides some rain forecast for December in the north part of the state, the winter will be drier than normal.
