He has been delighting children and adults alike for 350 years with his unconventional methods of dealing with his wife and child, not to mention policemen, doctors and even crocodiles.

But a killjoy tried to bring the curtain down on a Punch and Judy show when he accused organisers of glorifying child abuse.

Puppeteer Les Clarke was stunned when an angry member of the audience interrupted his show at Saddleworth High School in Uppermill near Oldham to complain about a violent scene involving Mr Punch and his baby.

Stunned: Les Clarke has been holding Punch and Judy shows for 25 years, but only now has he been accused of glorifying child abuse

Mr Clarke, 63, said: 'I was doing my second show of the day when it got to the part of the show where Punch is looking after the baby.

'It’s a knock-about comedy but in my show he doesn’t hit the baby, but it’s part of the fun to think he might.

'All of the kids in the audience shout
out as he puts a bucket on the baby’s head and looks like he is going 
to hit it with a club.'

That's not the way to do it: A man complained after Mr Punch shoved his baby's head into a bucket and threatened to hit it with a stick

The man, who has not been named, first made a complaint to his partner, Kay Wilson, and then to Rotary officials.

Mr Clarke said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t think the guy could be serious.

'I have been doing it for 25 years and it’s the first response like this I’ve ever had.

The earliest recorded evidence of Punch and Judy can be found in the diary of Samuel Pepys.

After a visit to Covent Garden in 1662, Pepys wrote: 'Thence
to see an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles there, which is
very pretty, the best that ever I saw, and great resort of gallants.'

In the late Victorian era the show evolved into entertainment aimed primarily at children.

Ancient members of the cast,
such as the Devil and Punch's mistress Pretty Polly, were written out due to fears they were inappropriate.

The term 'pleased as Punch' is derived 
from Punch and Judy and comes from Punch’s characteristic sense of 
gleeful self-satisfaction.

'The funny thing is that I regularly 
do shows for children aged between three and 10 and they always 
understand that it is a silly show. It is not real life. They have fun 
shouting at Punch and telling him off for hitting everyone.

'They shout "you shouldn’t be throwing the baby out of the window" and they find it really funny.”

In the section of the show that 
caused the complaint, Punch steals the baby’s sausages but then falls 
over, which he blames the tot for.

He then puts a bucket on the baby’s head and threatens it with a stick.

Mr Clarke, a former designer, said: 'I
thought the man was joking when he first complained the puppet was 
encouraging child abuse.

'Traditional Punch and Judy shows 
have been around for 350 years. Mr Punch chasing the baby is just 
part of the show’s heritage. We were speechless.'

Rotary Club member Mike 
Hall met the complainant.

He said: 'I was completely taken by 
surprise. I was so astounded I just walked away, shaking my head.'

Mr Clarke said he regularly performs at shows, parties and events as well as regular appearances at care homes.

He said Punch and Judy shows are more popular now than when he began in the business.

He said: 'They are such great fun and 
it gives children a live experience away from computers and televisions.
It’s a really interactive experience that everyone can enjoy.'

Who's a pretty boy then? Certainly not Mr Punch, whose antics caused outrage with one member of the audience at a community fete
