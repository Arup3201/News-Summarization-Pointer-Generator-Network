Cleared: Russell Woolwright leaving Bournemouth Crown Court today. He was found not guilty of two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as as an adult in a position of trust

A PUBLIC school teacher accused of engaging in sexual activity with a ‘flirty’ female pupil spoke of his frustration yesterday after he was cleared of any wrongdoing.

Russell Woolwright, 30, said the false allegations had forced him to resign from his job as an economics teacher at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, where he had worked for five years.

The girl, who was 17 at the time, sent Mr Woolwright a series of inappropriate emails – but he insisted there had  been no sexual contact.

After having to endure a four-day trial in which he was charged with making the teenager perform a sex act on him  during an encounter in an alleyway,  he said the system leaves all the  ‘power with the pupils and not with  the teachers’.

Mr Woolwright met up with the girl after she pestered him with a string of lewd emails including one she titled ‘party in my pants’.

He said he told the girl to stop contacting him and twice backed away when she tried to kiss him.

After the police later learnt of the  email exchange between the pair,  the girl ‘embellished’ her version of events and claimed she carried out  the sex act.

But a jury took just 90 minutes  to find him not guilty of two  counts of causing or inciting  sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust.

After the verdict at Bournemouth Crown Court, Mr Woolwright said: ‘It’s a huge relief.

‘I now feel I can go out again without being judged and I can get on with my life which I am having to rebuild from scratch.’

He went on to say: ‘This trial has not only affected me but also my friends and family.

‘It has made me realise the power is with the pupils and not with the teachers. An allegation can be made at any time.’

Mr
 Woolwright also revealed that he would like to get back into teaching 
again, but said he would be ‘more wary’ of situations involving students
 in the future.

The girl, 
who cannot be named for legal reasons, started emailing the teacher 
after they bumped into each other in Wimborne, Dorset.

'I love my job': Mr Woolwright was forced to resign from his role as an economics teacher at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, pictured, where he had worked for five years in the wake of the allegations

On October 25 last year he was sent an email from a friend of the complainant which he received on his mobile phone.

The first message said ‘[she] wants you’ and another one read: ‘Hurry up Wussy Russy.’

The
 girl, described in court as ‘flirtatious’, then sent an email which was
 titled ‘party in my  pants’ and boasted of her sexual prowess in a 
follow-up message.

Mr 
Woolwright insisted that he was angry and shocked by the nature of the 
messages, and claimed he had only decided to meet up with the girl so 
that he could tell her to stop.

He
 told the court: ‘I saw it as an opportunity to say “look these emails 
really have to stop. It’s inappropriate in the language that’s been 
used.”’

He emailed both the girls in the days following the encounter to urge them to delete the emails they had swapped.

When
 he was questioned by the police he acknowledged he had been wrong to 
put himself anywhere near the girl at the time and admitted that he 
should instead have taken up the matter with the school’s headmaster.

He told officers: ‘I don’t want this allegation to ruin my job at Canford and also my teaching career because I love it.’

Mr
 Woolwright, from Bristol, flatly denied the girl’s version of events 
when they were put to him by prosecutor David Bartlett during the trial.

He is currently not teaching but working for a company which manufactures audio devices.
