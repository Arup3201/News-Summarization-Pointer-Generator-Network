Simon Kerrigan has been named in the England's second Test squad to face India to start this week.

The Lancashire spinner had been with Alastair Cook's men at Trent Bridge before being sent to get some county overs under his belt as they began a County Championship game against Nottinghamshire in Liverpool.

Kerrigan got the chance to turn his arm over briefly at Aigburth and will link up with the international side imminently, with the Red Rose allowed to bring in a replacement.

Nobody has been dropped from the squad, with the spinner coming in as the 14th member of the Test party.

That sees Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes, not selected for the opening game of the series, included too.

Selecting Kerrigan signifies an about-turn by England following the appointment of Peter Moores as coach earlier in the year. It had looked as if the 25-year-old was set for an international exile after a difficult debut against Australia at the Oval last year.

He was carted around the park during eight difficult overs that eventually went for 53, but has rediscovered some form so far this season, taking 28 Championship wickets, and Moores knows all about him given the pair's previous relationship at Old Trafford.

England selector Mick Newell, who is also Nottinghamshire coach, said at Aigburth on Sunday: 'Simon Kerrigan is the key man, he is very much the future for England.'

Experience: Kerrigan suffered after being selected for England against Australia at the Oval last summer

The player himself appears buoyant after finding his form again, saying recently: 'Since the last innings of the Warwickshire game at Edgbaston, I've felt really good about my bowling.

'This game has been a little bit of a step back, but I'll keep plugging away and doing what I'm doing, and hopefully I'll get back to my best.

'Over the last three weeks, it's been getting to where I wanted it to get to. There's still progress to be made, which is the same with any bowler I guess.

'But I work hard at my skills, as hard as anyone, and hopefully I'll get to where I want to get to.'
