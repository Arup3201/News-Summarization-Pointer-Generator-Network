Pep Guardiola believes his Bayern Munich side were the best team in their group by some distance after they booked their place in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday night.

Guardiola's men stormed to a 3-0 victory over CSKA Moscow at the Allianz Arena thanks to strikes from Thomas Muller, Sebastian Rode and Mario Gotze.

Bayern finished seven points ahead of second-placed Manchester City to top Group E and Guardiola feels his dominant side were the best team throughout the campaign despite the 3-2 loss to Manuel Pellegrini's outfit in November.

'We lost only once in the group stages and were better than the opposition in every game,' said Guardiola.

'I am proud of the entire squad. We were outstanding. We were always focused. Everybody did very well.'

Rode, who scored his first goal in the Champions League against the Russians, feels his side were easily the best team in the group despite their slip-up at the Etihad.

'It was a nearly perfect group stage,' said Rode. 'It’s a pity that we lost at Manchester City (at the Etihad Stadium). Now we are looking forward to the draw of the last 16 on Monday.

'Moscow played very defensively and we wasted some good chances.

'The first goal in the Champions League is always something special, but it‘s more important that we won this match.'
