Fans of Mexican fast food chain Chipotle are urged to try asking for a mysterious item called a quesarito when they next visit their local branch.

A quesarito – essentially a quesadilla wrapped into a burrito – doesn’t feature on any Chipotle menu but the internet is alive with rumors about it existence and how you can go about ordering one.

The company won’t officially confirm the existence of the super burrito, but it does exist.

It even has its own Facebook page, which describes it as ‘the most delicious combination of goodness that one can indulge in at the ever popular Chipotle.

'It will revolutionize the way that you eat burritos because you will never eat a normal burrito from Chipotle again after you've experienced the quesarito.’

One online reviewer, who claims to have tasted the fabled fast food, has given it a very positive review.

‘The use of the quesadilla gives the 
burrito a nice crisp sear as well as a solid layer of cheesy goodness. 
The cheese cools pretty fast though and isn't as gooey as some may like 
but I like it,’ he writes on Brand Eating.

Secret menu items are the stuff of legend for hardcore fast 
food fans with chains including Starbucks, McDonalds and In-N-Out Burger all reputedly selling adapted versions of regular menu items if they are requested.

A spokesperson for Chipotle has denied 
the existence of a formalized secret menu, but has admitted that branches 
can prepare two off-menu items - 
nachos and quesadillas.

The line machinery at Chipotle isn't customized to make these items in restaurants, so workers have to improvise placing the cheese on top of the hot means because they don't have melted nacho cheese. 

These secret items aren't in any operations manual either, so employees are left to teach each other how to do the off-menu concoctions, creating an 'oral history,' reports Fast Company.

Be warned however the quesarito is not for those on a calorie controlled diet, weighing in at a whopping 1,540-calories.
