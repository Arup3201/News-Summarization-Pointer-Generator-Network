Sex Pistols front-man Johnny Rotten - real name John Lydon - urged voters to ignore Russell Brand

Veteran punk front-man Johnny Rotten has urged youngsters to ignore  Russell Brand – and make sure they get out and use their vote.

The Sex Pistols lead singer, who once claimed to be the antichrist who wanted to ‘destroy passers-by’, said Brand was a 'b**hole'.

Rotten, also known by his real name John Lydon, said: ‘If you don’t vote, you don’t count. It’s only a century ago that none of us had the right to vote and we don’t want to go back to that route.’

The 58-year-old refused to say who he supported, adding: ‘I’m very wary of tagging my name on to supporting any of those phoney b*****ds, but don’t be like Russell Brand.’

The remarks, to the Cheltenham Literature Festival, come after Mr Brand sparked controversy after calling on voters to ignore the upcoming election.

The Hollywood star and comedian told the BBC: 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.'

He added: ‘It is not that I am not voting out of apathy. I am not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class that has been going on for generations.’

Brand said Mr Lydon's experience at state school ‘seemed to primarily be the installation of a belief system that placed his generation and class at the bottom of an immovable hierarchical structure’.

But Mr Lydon urged people dissatisfied with politics to take their grievances to their local council.

‘Go to town hall meetings and give them f***ing hell,’ he said.

‘I’m not being flippant. If you don’t start locally you’re not going to change the world.’

It is not the first time Mr Brand’s comments have been criticised in public.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the comments were likely to further entrench people’s anger with politicians.

He pointed to figures showing that ‘older people, wealthier people, better educated people, engaged people’ are most likely to vote, which ‘young people, poor people, badly educated people’ are the least.

As a result politicians of all parties ‘fear alienating’ the more engaged, while choosing to ‘ignore’ those who do not bother voting, placing them instead in the ‘firing line’ for spending cuts.

‘Paradoxically the more those who are not engaged are ignored, targeted under the austerity programme and dismissed, the more alienated and disillusioned they become. Politicians they say "don’t give a damn about us".’

The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog has warned that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future.

But Mr Brand is not the only public figure to reveal that they had lost faith in the political process. 

Veteran former BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates.

Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman said he once decided not to vote because the choice was so 'unappetising'

Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.

‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write ‘none of the above’ on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’

But Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example.

Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’
