The grieving families of Britons who died overseas have hit out at the incompetence and insensitivity of Foreign Office staff employed to help them.

They have accused consular officials of being uncaring and unhelpful – and even of failing to dress appropriately – making their heartache even more traumatic.

The damning criticisms come in a report by a cross-party panel of MPs which ordered the Foreign Office to improve its services to bereaved families. MPs also demanded an inquiry into claims some torture victims were failed by consular staff.

Despite being ‘tested’ in recent years by people getting into trouble when taking more ‘adventurous’ holidays, and by other crises, the service has cut its staff by more than half.

And in a hard-hitting report, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warned the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) ‘not to dehumanise and minimise the service’ in the pursuit of ‘excessive cost-cutting’.

MPs also raised concerns over the lack of British staff among consul employees as more than 90 per cent of those jobs are now filled by local staff. The Committee revealed how some families dealing with the tragic death of loved ones abroad felt ‘entirely let down’ by consuls.

Karen Walchester, whose son was found dead in Tenerife, told MPs there was ‘no one to take responsibility for care of a broken-hearted family trying to muddle through a chaotic system whilst in terrible grief and confusion. The FCO say they are helping the family when someone dies abroad, but most of what they do can be found on the internet’.

MPs concluded there was ‘substantial anecdotal evidence’ that the consular service had at times ‘fallen well below the expected standards’ – including repeated failures of communication and compassion

The family of a teacher murdered in Havana in March 2012 told MPs that the handling of their tragedy had been ‘wholly incompetent’.

They said: ‘We had an expectation that in such a time of crisis there would be an infrastructure of solid support, with efficient, robust consular assistance. This was not the case. The FCO added significantly to the trauma and confusion.’

A witness to the Committee, whose partner died in a plane crash in Nepal, spoke about flying out to visit the crash site only to find embassy staff were waiting dressed in shorts and T-shirts.

MPs concluded there was ‘substantial anecdotal evidence’ that the consular service had at times ‘fallen well below the expected standards’ – including repeated failures of communication and compassion. Official consular guidance to families affected by the murder of a relative overseas was also branded ‘timid’.

MPs also called for a specific investigation into claims some consular staff failed to offer their full protection to torture victims.

They heard claims that FCO officials in Dubai had failed to take a proper record of one Briton’s injuries, ‘had not been sympathetic or compassionate’ and did not apply diplomatic pressure until his friends took their story to the press.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Some of the issues the Committee has identified, including our response to murders abroad, are areas that we are already working to improve.’
