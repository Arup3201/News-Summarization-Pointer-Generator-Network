Brussels has sparked outrage in Denmark by proposing to outlaw their traditional pastries.

Christmas festivities have been dampened in Copenhagen by the prospect that this could be the last year its citizens will be able to eat their kanelsnegler or cinnamon rolls.

The end to the beloved pastries comes from EU limits on the amount of coumarin, a naturally occurring toxic chemical found in the most commonly used type of cinnamon, cassia.

The European Union has angered Denmark by proposing to outlaw the country's traditional pastries

Kanelsnegler - very popular in Nordic countries - contain high amounts of cinnamon.

But the ban is not expected to affect British lovers of Danish pastries, because the types we get here do not contain such high levels of cinnamon.

Hardy Christensen, the head of the Danish Baker's Association, said: 'It's the end of the cinnamon roll as we know it.

'Cinnamon rolls are of course a traditional Danish baked product. We've been making bread and cakes with cinnamon for 200 years.'

The proposed ban follows plans by Denmark's food safety agency to implement the EU regulations on the amount of 'everyday fine baked goods' - limiting coumarin to 15mg a kilo.

Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, said: 'An average person would have to eat so many Danish pastries in order to affected'

But in Sweden, the government has 
classed their cinnamon pastries as a 'traditional and seasonal dish' - 
allowing them to use cinnamon at over three times higher, 50mg per kilo.

There is anger in Denmark that its government has not stuck up for its cinnamon pastries as much as the Swedish government.

They have simply given kanelsnegler a temporary reprieve until February.

Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, said: 'An average person would have to eat so many Danish pastries in order to affected, they would certainly die of obesity before being hurt by a low level of cinnamon.

'We don't need the nanny state or the EU to tell us what to do and certainly not how many Danish pastries we should eat for Christmas.'

British research has concluded that 'the extent to which coumarin is bad for the health' is debatable.

And the CBI has advised cinnamon importers into Britain that: 'Research has shown that the average dietary intake of the UK population does not exceed safe limits.'

A study for the UK Food Standards Agency in 2010 found that the average dietary exposure to coumarin in the UK was 55 times less than the EU's definition of the 'tolerable daily limit' of 0.1mg per kilo of body weight.
