Ryan McDonald, a physics student at Oxford University, said his prospective trip to Mars is putting a dampner on his love life 

One of the British volunteers who wants to be chosen for a pioneering mission to Mars has admitted that the prospective one-way journey  is hampering his love life.

Ryan McDonald, 21, is the youngest - and the only man - among five Britons who have been shortlisted for the Mars One Mission, which is aiming to send people to live in space by 2025.

The Oxford University physics student, who is also president of Oxford University Space and Astronomy Society, applied for the trip because he wants to leave a legacy. 

But he said today that the potential life-changing mission leaves him with little hope of finding love.

He told The Daily Mirror: 'Being single makes it easier for me at the moment because what kind of conversation start is it to say "I'm going to be leaving the planet in the next 10 years".

'I'm full-on focused on the mission... So I wouldn't be able to have a future with anyone if I started a relationship.'

But Mr McDonald, from Derby, said he 'wouldn't rule out' an extra-terrestrial relationship once he has been propelled into space.

Mr McDonald has been shortlisted for the mission alongside Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham University, Dr Alison Rigby, 35, a lab technician from south east London, Maggie Lieu, 24, an astrophysics student at the University of Birmingham, and Clare Weedon, 27, a systems information manager from Addlestone, Surrey. 

The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews.

They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round.

The majority of the 100 applicants come from the U.S., 31 from Europe, 16 from Asia, seven from Africa and seven from Australia.

The team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth. 

Mr McDonald, a sci-fi fan, is currently designing a Thermal-IR camera for a future sample return mission to Mars’s moon Phobos, which could one day select the first landing site on the moons of Mars.

Of his enthusiasm for the Mars One mission, he said: ‘To search for evidence of past or present life, to speak to and inspire school children back on Earth, to build the first civilisation on another planet… How could anyone say no to that!’

He added: 'The most important thing to do in life is to leave a legacy. A lot of people do that by having a child, having a family. For me this would be my legacy.'

While the experience may be amazing, it will certainly be tough. The crew of four will have to contend with temperatures as low as -62C and high radiation levels.

They could also be at risk of suffocation, starvation and dehydration.

If all goes well, additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars.

There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation.

In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission in 2011.

In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions' to test individuals' responses to stressful situations, the current shortlist will be reduced to 40.

Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the Red Planet.

Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice.

Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission. 

Last year, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that any manned mission to Mars would result in the crew dying after 68 days, while critics have pointed out that the estimated cost of Mars One is a fraction of the amount proposed by Nasa.

The privately-funded mission is estimated to cost $6 billion (£4 billion).

The robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022.

The time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list, but candidates are expected to know whether they have made the cut by the end of this year.
