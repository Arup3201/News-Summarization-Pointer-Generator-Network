Sunderland will ‘review its position’ regarding suspended winger Adam Johnson after police extended his bail following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.

The club suspended the 27-year-old ‘pending the outcome of the police investigation’ when he was arrested at his £1.8million mansion in County Durham on March 2.

It was confirmed on Tuesday that Johnson has now been told to report back to a Durham police station at 10am on Thursday, April 23.

The gates at Johnson's £1.8million mansion were shut following his arrest earlier this month

And the club said in a statement: ‘Following the decision by the police today (Tuesday), the club will be reviewing its position and will not make any further comment at the present time.’ 

Johnson has missed their last two matches but could now be available to new boss Dick Advocaat if the club decide to lift the player’s suspension.

Sportsmail reported on Tuesday that Johnson has been training at home with a fitness coach in the hope that the case would be dropped.

Meanwhile, Durham Constabulary issued a warning to those using social media that identifying the alleged victim is a criminal offence.

A spokesman said: ‘Durham Constabulary is aware this investigation has resulted in considerable rumour and speculation, much of it on social media and in relation to the victim.

‘This has caused distress to the victim and her family and is very unhelpful while we still have a number of actions to carry out as part of our enquiries.

‘We stress again the warning we have already given, that anyone who publishes anything which may identify the victim of a sexual offence is committing a criminal act and will be dealt with accordingly.

‘At the time of the man’s arrest, media reports suggested a weapon had been recovered from the house. This has now been fully examined and confirmed to be an item which does not require a firearms certificate, therefore no further police action will follow.’
