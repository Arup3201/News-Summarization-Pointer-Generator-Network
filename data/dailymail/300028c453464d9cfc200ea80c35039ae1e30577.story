Jack Wilshere is set to be reprimanded by Arsene Wenger after he was embroiled in a third smoking storm in 15 months.

And the Gunners boss was handed another headache on Thursday after revealing star man Alexis Sanchez will miss the north London derby on Saturday through injury.

Photographs emerged this week of Wilshere, who is recovering from ankle surgery, holding a shisha pipe while on a night out with friends.

And Wenger is said to be concerned after Wilshere, who has not played since injuring ankle ligaments in the home defeat by Manchester United in November, was caught in yet another compromising situation.

The Arsenal manager will wait to hear the midfielder’s version of events before deciding on the level of punishment, but the club are understood to have taken a very dim view of the matter, particularly given Wilshere has previous.

The 22-year-old, who could be fined, will be reminded of his responsibilities once again by Wenger after his latest misdemeanour.

In the latest photo Wilshere can be seen holding a shisha pipe, though as of last night there was no confirmation that he had taken a puff.

No doubt aware of the latest controversy surrounding him, Wilshere responded last night by posting on Instagram a video and pictures of him training, accompanied with the message: ‘Worry about your character not your reputation, because your character is who you are and your reputation is only what people who don’t know you think about you!’

News of Wilshere's smoking is bound to infuriate manager Arsene Wenger yet again

Shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco, usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, through a bowl and hose or tube 

Despite the riposte, Wenger will be frustrated that he has to deal with yet another smoking-related controversy involving one of his players.

Wilshere has been caught smoking on two other occasions and Wenger will again face awkward questions about his young midfielder during this morning’s pre-match press conference ahead of tomorrow’s clash against Tottenham.

Gunners keeper Wojciech Szczesny was fined by the club for smoking in the showers following the defeat by Southampton on New Year’s Day. On a positive note Wilshere will return to full training next week after his two-month spell on the sidelines.

However there was more concerning news regarding Sanchez, who will miss the trip to White Hart Lane with a hamstring injury, as will Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has a groin problem.

It was hoped Sanchez would be available to face Mauricio Pochettino’s side after missing last weekend’s 5-0 win over Aston Villa.

Wenger confirmed: ‘Alexis is not ready. He is not far away, the Leicester game (on Tuesday) is a possibility. He is of course very difficult to keep quiet. He is training but it’s light training.

‘Jack is back in full training next week, hopefully from Sunday.’
