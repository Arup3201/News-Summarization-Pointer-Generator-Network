A notorious 
Rockefeller impostor has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the
death of a man whose bones were found buried beneath a California home in 1985.

Christian Gerhartsreiter was tried 28 years after the 
disappearance of newlyweds John and Linda Sohus in a heavily 
circumstantial cold case.

Much of the prosecution’s evidence focused on 
the strange behavior of the man who adopted many names including Clark 
Rockefeller. He masqueraded as an heir to the fabled oil fortune for 20 
years.

The verdict was reached on Wednesday after the jury deliberated about a day.

Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter of Germany is found guilty of first degree murder in his murder trial in Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles, California, today

Authorities said Gerhartsreiter was a German immigrant who lived 
another life long ago, occupying a guest cottage at the home of Sohus’ 
mother in the ritzy suburb of San Marino.

He was known then as Chris 
Chichester and intimated he was of royal lineage. He joined the church, 
befriended residents and told some he was a film student.

A friend
said Linda Sohus once described the tenant in the cottage owned by 
John’s mother as 'creepy' and said she and her husband never spoke to 
him.

The town folk didn’t connect him with the disappearance of the Sohus couple in 1985, but shortly after they vanished, so did he.

No
trace of Linda has been found but John’s bones were unearthed during 
excavation of a swimming pool at the San Marino property in 1994. With 
no clues, the mystery went cold again.

Gerhartsreiter, who went by the alias Clark Rockefeller,was found guilty of killing his landlord, John Sohus, in February 1985

The German native who consorted for years with New Englandís social elite by pretending to be a Rockefeller was convicted Wednesday in Los Angeles of first-degree murder

But across the country, a man variously known as Chris Crowe, Chip 
Smith and Clark Rockefeller was inventing new lives for himself.

This
impostor wormed his way into high society and talked his way into 
important jobs. He married a wealthy woman and controlled her funds, but
his identity unraveled when he kidnapped their daughter during a 
custody dispute. She testified that he became increasingly paranoid when
police begin inquiring about him.

When he was unmasked, he became
the subject of magazine articles, true crime books and TV movies that 
sought to explore his bizarre story and get to the heart of the man 
behind the pseudonyms.

The resulting publicity led California 
authorities to revisit the Sohus disappearance. They realized the man in
custody in Boston was not an heir to the Rockefeller fortune but was 
the man who had lived in San Marino decades ago.

Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 52, was accused of bludgeoning his landlady's adult son with a blunt object and then digging a 3-foot-deep grave in the backyard of the victimís home

Already serving 
time for the kidnapping of his young daughter in a Boston custody 
dispute, Gerhartsreiter was close to the end of his sentence and headed 
for freedom when the murder charge changed that. After a quarter 
century, authorities believed they had linked him to the disappearance 
of his old neighbor, Sohus.

Defense attorneys suggested that Linda
Sohus, not their client, killed her husband. But no motive was offered
for her or Gerhartsreiter to have killed the young man.

Prosecutors
filled in the blanks of the defendant’s whereabouts during the decades 
of his disappearance. But some details were unlikely ever to be 
explained.

He chose not to testify in his own defense and much of 
the trial testimony came from people now hobbled by age who knew him in 
San Marino as Chris Chichester, a stranger with a murky past.

Yesterday, prosecutor Habib 
Balian told the jury that Christian Gerhartsreiter murdered John Sohus 
in San Marino 28 years ago and said that all the evidence they needed to
convict him was there.

'This
isn't a movie, a book, a TV show, a docudrama,' the Deputy District 
Attorney said in his closing argument, referring to the fact that the 
case has been turned into all of those things over the years.

'This case is about two people who lived and died,' Balian said.

Gerhartsreiter is on trial in California, U.S. for the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his home in San Marino with his wife, Linda

Defendant 
Christian Gerhartsreiter was charged only with the murder of Mr Sohus in 
suburban San Marino, but the prosecutor was allowed to say he 
believes Gerhartsreiter also killed Mr Sohus' wife, who remains missing 
after nearly three decades.

'She's
dead', Balian said repeatedly as he described the disappearance of 
Linda Sohus and her husband, John - newlyweds he said had no reason to 
vanish.

The
bones of John Sohus were unearthed in the backyard of his mother's 
former house in San Marino a decade after he and his wife disappeared. 

He was found to have died from multiple fractures to the skull, probably
caused by a blunt instrument such as a baseball bat.

Gerhartsreiter
lived as a tenant on the property in 1984 and 1985, but called himself 
Chris Chichester then. 

He vanished around the same time the couple 
disappeared in 1985, according to witnesses.

As part of his closing argument, Balian used a Powerpoint presentation that showed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle falling into place.

Balian predicted that the defense would seek to paint Linda Sohus as the murderer of her husband.

Previously the trial heard from Gerhartsreiter's ex-wife Sandra Boss, right, to whom he lied about who he was

'They're going to 
batter her over and over and say she was the mastermind,' Balian said in
his presentation. 'But all the evidence in this case is going to point 
you to the fact that only one person was the mastermind. ... He is 
charged with murder.'

However,
defense attorney Jeffrey Denner was less demeaning of Linda Sohus than 
he was of his own client. He said Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant, 
was a white-collar criminal with a long list of offenses including 
identity theft and immigration fraud.

'Over
a period of time in this country, he committed a lot of crimes with 
which he was never charged', Denner said. 'It's no wonder he would want 
to stay under the radar.'

But the lawyer said his client had not been running from a murder investigation.

The defendant, seen here with pen in his hand, took copious notes as the prosecutor summed up the case against him

Denner noted that 
no trace evidence was scientifically connected to the defendant, and he 
suggested it was more likely that Linda Sohus had a 'dark side' of her 
life that led her to kill her husband. But he offered no evidence to 
support that contention.

'That's
the stuff that reasonable doubt is made of', he told jurors. 'You don't
know what happened. If you don't know what happened, you can't convict 
anybody.'

Balian noted that Monday was the 28th anniversary of the day Linda and John Sohus were reported missing.

'What do we do with a case 28 years old?' he said, acknowledging there are no eye witnesses or physical evidence in the case.

'Circumstantial evidence is just as powerful', Balian said as he detailed the pieces of his puzzle.

'Not
only does he flee, he changes his identity and discontinues contacts 
with friends. Why? Because he's a murderer', the prosecutor said.

Eventually,
Gerhartsreiter turned up on the East Coast using the name Clark 
Rockefeller and living well at the expense of his wealthy wife.

Gerhartsreiter was previously prosecuted for kidnapping his own daughter and is serving a prison sentence for that crime.

Defense
lawyers have suggested that he lived a life of pretense, making up wild
stories about royal lineage, but they say he never killed anyone.

'He
lied at will and his life was based on that', Denner said. 'He said he 
was a filmmaker and he could amend the script anytime he wanted.'

Balian reminded 
jurors of testimony by former friends from San Marino. A woman 
remembered seeing dirt in his yard where a large hole had been dug.

A
forensic expert said traces of blood were found on the concrete floor 
beneath a rug in the guest cottage the defendant occupied, bt it was 
never clear if the blood was human or animal, and it was not linked to 
Gerhartsreiter.

The
prosecutor also emphasized what was found in the backyard grave along 
with bones - plastic shopping bags from the University of Southern 
California and University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, two colleges the 
defendant attended.

'The case is easy', said Balian. 'The evidence is right in front of your eyes.'

The only thing missing, he acknowledged was a motive. Why would the defendant kill John Sohus?

'The
prosecution need not prove why', he said. 'It's not part of our burden 
of proof. Nor do we need to prove the type of weapon used or where he 
was killed.'

Superior Court Judge George Lomeli instructed jurors 
that if they cannot agree on the charge of first-degree murder, they 
have the option of considering second-degree murder, which does not 
require premeditation.

He told jurors to return Tuesday for Balian's rebuttal before the start of their deliberations.
