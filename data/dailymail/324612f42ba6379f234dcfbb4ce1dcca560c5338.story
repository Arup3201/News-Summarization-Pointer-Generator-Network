This Peke was at his peak.

Malachy
 the Pekingese wobbled off with best in show tonight at the 
Westminster Kennel Club, becoming America's dog to the delight of an 
adoring crowd that called his name.

The four-year-old bobbing pompom won his 115th overall best in show title. He 
beat out a Dalmatian, German shepherd, Doberman pinscher, Irish setter, a
 Kerry blue terrier and wire-haired dachshund at Madison Square Garden.

Handler
 David Fitzpatrick gave Malachy a little help - he carried him a short 
way onto the green carpet for the final line-up, shortening the long walk
 the ring. Malachy's pink tongue popped up from his silver-and-white 
fur, his eyes sparkling like black diamonds as he soaked in the cheers.

Judge
 Cindy Vogels picked the winner as fans hollered for their favourites. 
The number two show dog in the nation this year was clearly the most popular,
 and Malachy won after taking the toy group here last February.

The
 champion at Westminster wins a coveted silver bowl, but not a cent of 
prize money. Instead, the prestige of this title lasts a lifetime for 
any owner, and brings a wealth of opportunity in breeding potential.

This was the fourth time a Peke won at Westminster, and the first since 1990.

Right
 before the champion was picked, a woman was stopped by security as she 
appeared to try to reach the ring. A few years ago, a PETA protest took 
place in the centre area.

Several top choices lost out early as underdogs ruled the breed judging.

A
 black cocker spaniel called Beckham who was the nation's number one show dog
 and a wire fox terrier named Eira picked by many to win proved once 
again it takes more than a great reputation to own the green carpet.

Because
 no matter how many blue ribbons or silver bowls or shiny trophies any 
dog brings to Westminster, there's a phrase that ultimately decides who 
wins the top prize.

A half-hour demonstration outside Madison Square Garden Tuesday took a different focus on Mitt Romney and his oft-told story of traveling with his Irish setter, Seamus, strapped to the roof of his car.

Mr Romney has said he put the dog inside a crate and strapped it to the roof rack in 1983 for a 12-hour drive from Boston to Canada.

The protesters held signs that said 'Mitt is Mean' and 'Dogs Aren't Luggage' and 'I Ride Inside.'

A few curious passers-by stopped to talk to the protesters, one many hollered in a hurry: 'Dogs don't vote!'

Al Alvarez held a sign in one hand and the leash to Petey the bull terrier in the other.

'I think Romney's attitude toward dogs was indicative of his attitude toward the most vulnerable in our society,' he said.  

'Dog on the day,' fanciers say.

More
 than 2,000 purebred dogs were entered overall and Marlene Ness came 
from Canada to show her black cocker, Ace, at Westminster for the first 
time. Her main opposition? Beckham, a popular pick to win the whole 
thing.

Yet on this day, Ace was aces.

'I should have bought a Lotto ticket,' Ness said.

The
 fans crowded around Ring 3 seemed to sense an upset, cheering for 
Beckham but then yelling for the smoother-looking Ace. Judge Donald 
Sturz Jr studied them intently, checking their body type and making 
them run around several times before making his final choice.

On this afternoon, Ace was in the right place. Best dog of his breed.

'Today was our day,' Ness said. 'Eye of the tiger, baby!'

Ace, however, was topped by the Irish setter in the sporting round.

Eira
 made a real early exit. She won the prestigious National dog show that 
was televised on Thanksgiving Day and was the top terrier last year. 
That meant a lot - terriers often rule Westminster, with wire foxes 
winning the silver bowl more than any other kind.

It was, however, a really big day for a Tibetan mastiff, and even more so for his owners.

Major
 won his breed, a nice start for Debbie Parsons and Brad Slayton. A few 
hours later, the co-owners from the Seattle area made it a special 
Valentine's Day - they got married in the backstage benching area where 
hundreds of dogs are housed.

With dogs 
brushing by, people climbing on crates to get a better view and the 
total crush of the crowd, it made for a somewhat chaotic scene.

Winner: Martha Stewart's Chow Chow dog named GK or Ghenghis Khan, won best in its breed Monday causing the celebrity to take to Twitter in celebration

Coming or going: A French Bulldog is seen inside its cage, one of more than 2,000 entries in 185 breeds and varieties

Break: Groomers are seen taking a break from America's most prestigious dog show which will conclude Tuesday evening

Awaiting competition: Dog handler Sarah Congoleton sits with Sedona, an English Springer Spaniel breed, who will face a black cocker spaniel named Beckham who was the No. 1 show dog last year

Cherilyn
 Frei, a chaplain and director of family support for Ronald McDonald 
House in New York and the wife of Westminster television host David 
Frei, performed the five-minute ceremony.

The 
54-year-old Parsons wore a pale pink Vera Wang gown and the 58-year-old 
Slayton donned a silver tux, with each sporting accents of Westminster 
purple.

The 120-pound Major stood right between them, giving away the 
bride, and they kissed him to celebrate.

'This
 dog brought us together,' Slayton said. 'Today,' he added, choking up,'
 I bought a Valentine's Day card for my wife, not my girlfriend.'

More than 2,000 entries in 185 breeds
 and varieties were at the 136th Westminster.

Bonding time: Michelle Paulin and Storm, a Dogue de Bordeaux, sat in the judging ring at the dog show Tuesday

Anticipation: Mellisa Foehkolb and Roy, a German Wirehaired Pointer, waited their turn to go in the judging ring Tuesday

Strut: Once in the ring, a Komondorok named Raaza shook her thick, long strands at her owner's side

Captured: The Komondorok appeared to nearly draped the carpet with her long white locks

The nonsporting and 
herding champions were to be picked later Monday night, and the best in 
show will chosen on Tuesday evening.

Among
 the early winners in breed judging: a xoloitzcuintli called Giorgio Armani and a chow chow co-owned by Martha 
Stewart, a nice start for the
 alphabetically challenged contestant during Fashion Week in New York 
City.

Celebrities are fairly common at 
Westminster â€” Glenn Close, Kristin Davis and Mary Tyler Moore have made 
appearances â€” and Stewart made her presence known with her dog called 
GK.

'Ghenghis Khan did it!' she tweeted. 'Best of Breed at Westminster!!!! Big deal.'

Demonstration: Outside the show Tuesday afternoon, a demonstration got political in a gathering of 'Dogs Against Romney' after the presidential candidate admitted to once putting his dog on his car's roof

Can't vote: Members of the media gathered around an English bull terrier named Petey during the small protest which caused one passerby to remind them that dog's can't vote

Puppy passion: A woman inside the show showed off her tshirt, helping affirm the member's unconditional love and respect for their dogs, no matter their voting rights

Closing up: Trinity, a Neopolitan Mastiff, waits to go in the judging ring Tuesday, leading up to the day's final judging this evening of Best in Show

Profile peaks: With celebrities a common sight to see, Glenn Close, Kristin Davis and Mary Tyler Moore have made appearances

Expanding: In a few years, there could be up to 240 breeds at Westminster with the expanding pedigrees possibly accompanying Old English Sheepdogs like this one

The xoloitzcuintli, formerly known as the Mexican hairless, is among six new breeds at this year's show.

They're called a 'show low' for short and Giorgio Armani drew cheers from the fans crowded around the ring when he was picked as the best of his breed.

In a few years, there could be up to 240 breeds at Westminster.

To get to Westminster, a breed must meet American Kennel Club criteria â€” there has to be an ample population with a three-generation pedigree, a geographic spread of those dogs and a parent club to establish breed standards.
