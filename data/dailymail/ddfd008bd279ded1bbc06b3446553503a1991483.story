He confessed last year that becoming a grandfather made him feel ‘really rather old’.

But Prince Charles clearly dotes on Prince George, as this never-before-seen photograph of the baby’s christening last year shows.

The delightful family snapshot was visible in the background of a live internet video-link conducted by the Prince yesterday in Clarence House, his London home.

The Q&A session was broadcast by the website Google as part of its ‘Google+ Hangout’ series. Hosted by Alex Jones from BBC’s The One Show, it was a chance for Charles to chat with young people around the country.

And it was quite a step forward for the 66-year-old Prince, as Miss Jones pointed out: ‘This is the first time ever that His Royal Highness has used technology like this.’ 

Charles said: ‘Some modern methods of communication – Twitter, Facebook – are not exactly my forte, yet I am well aware that it is possible to reach an enormous number of people quickly through technology.’

Support: He made the comments while taking part in a Google+Hangout at Clarence House

Support: The Prince of Wales did the chat to support charity Step Up To Serve

It also marked the first anniversary of the £iwill campaign which he launched with support from leading politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron. 

The campaign, run by charity Step Up To Serve, aims to make social action the norm for all 10 to 20-year-olds in the UK by 2020.

Youth social action is defined as 'young people taking practical action in the service of others', such as volunteering, fundraising or campaigning.

'Some modern methods of communication - Twitter, Facebook - are not exactly my forte,' said the Prince during the event.

Enjoying himself: Charles appeared to enjoy his first online public discussion

'Yet I am well aware that it is possible to reach an enormous number of people quickly through technology.'

He urged organisations to join the campaign. 'We want helping others to become the norm for 10 to 20-year-olds across the UK,' he added.

The 30-minute event, which was hosted by Alex Jones from BBC’s The One Show, gave Charles the opportunity to talk to young people both in the room with them and joining in from around the country.

Speaking after the event, an admiring Jones said: 'This is the first time ever that His Royal Highness has used technology like this.'
