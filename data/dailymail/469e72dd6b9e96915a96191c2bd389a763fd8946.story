A baby boy was born in mid-air aboard a Royal Navy helicopter as an emergency team rushed his mother to hospital.

Marcus Daniel McLachlan, who arrived somewhere between the Isles of Scilly and Truro, is the second child ever delivered on one of the Queen's emergency vessels.

Doctors are still unsure what location to put on the birth certificate.

The unusual incident happened when heavily pregnant Ella McLachlan unexpectedly went into labour at her local hospital in Helston, Cornwall, at 5.05 yesterday afternoon.

Delighted: Ella and Barney McLachlan with new baby Marcus who was born on a Royal Navy rescue chopper

Without the facilities to deliver a child, doctors were forced to summon a Search and Rescue R193 helicopter from 771 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Culdrose.

Mrs McLachlan tried to hold on, with a medical team and husband Barney on board for support.

But just minutes into the flight, there was a change of plan and midwife Sue Watkins had to deliver the child in the back of the vessel.

The astounded Navy pilot, Flight Lieutenant Jon Owen, had been planning to land early on a make-shift landing strip due to fog.

But a call from the back meant he had to stay airborne.

He said: 'I gave the crew a "10 minutes left to run" heads up so they could prepare for arrival.

'However, the midwife shouted back that baby was preparing for his own immediate arrival and that we needed to get ready to deliver in the air.

Location: Doctors are still unsure what to put on the birth certificate. He was born two miles south east of Truro

Startled: Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris Royal Navy and Pilot Flight Lieutenant Jon Owen were flying the chopper when Mrs McLachlan exclaimed she couldn't hold on any longer. They were forced to stay airborne

Birthplace: Royal Navy Search and Rescue helicopter from 771 Naval Air Squadron where Ella McLachlan gave birth to a baby boy with help from the crew as they were taking her to hospital

'I simply looked at the other pilot, Lieutenant Paul Smalley, and we continued to fly as mother nature took over.'

They kept flying until baby Marcus was born weighing 5lb 3oz at 7.24pm, approximately two miles south east of Truro.

Once landed, the family were taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, where they are all doing well.

Mr Lachlan, a baker, said: 'We thought we’d have a relaxing day. Then at the end of the afternoon Ella started feeling some cramps.

'We went to see the midwife for an examination and she confirmed Ella was in labour and that she needed to call Culdrose to pick us up.

'The Culdrose boys were immense, absolutely phenomenal. At one point they had to shine a light for Sue.

'They were hugely caring and did us brilliantly. They always deliver and always look after us.'

Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris, the observer on board added: 'It was an exciting evening.

'We planned to transfer the mum direct to Treliske Hospital in Truro but baby had other ideas.'

He assisted the midwife, along with Petty Officer Aircrewman Gary Kneesh, for the birth.

'It’s pretty uncommon to announce to the Coast Guard that you had launched with seven persons on board, but were preparing to land with eight,' he said.

The Sea King helicopters of 771 NAS are summoned to emergencies more than 200 times a year.
