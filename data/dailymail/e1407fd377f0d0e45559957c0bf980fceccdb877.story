The parents of 10 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre have begun legal steps to sue the manufacturers of the AR-15 assault rifle Adam Lanza used to commit his December, 2012, massacre.

Twenty first-graders were shot dead and six teachers during the shocking school shooting and 10 parents have filed court documents as of Monday indicating they plan to file wrongful death lawsuits.

The filings were made in a probate court opening legal estates in their children's names and most of those parents checked a box on the forms saying they intend to file wrongful death actions, with themselves as administrators.

Grief: Lynn and Christopher McDonnell, the parents of seven-year-old Grace McDonnell, grieve near Sandy Hook Elementary after learning their daughter was one of 20 school children and six adults killed after a gunman opened fire inside the school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012

While the initial documents do not state who the targets of these lawsuits could be, several families met with attorneys from Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, a Bridgeport, Connecticut law firm, to discuss legal action against Bushmaster.

Bushmaster is the North Carolina based manufacturer of the AR-15 assault rifle 20-year-old Lanza used.

In addition, according to the Hartford Courant, there have been discussions about suing Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza and Newtown because of a lack of security at the school.

The statute of limitations in Connecticut dictate that Sunday is the last day any civil lawsuits could be filed.

According to the Hartford Courant, the families would sue the insurance company that holds the policy against Nancy Lanza's Newtown home where her son shot her dead in the morning before his killing spree.

Negligence:On December 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his way into the school with a Bushmaster rifle and killed 20 children and six educators, then shot himself to death with a handgun. The school shooting came after Lanza killed his mother, Nancy (left), at their Newtown home

The estate is worth $64,000.

Several parents who filed the estate documents didn't immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.

The probate court filings involve 10 children killed in the massacre: Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Jesse Lewis, Ana Marquez-Greene, Grace McDonnell, Jack Pinto, Jessica Rekos, Avielle Richman and Benjamin Wheeler.

State investigations into the shooting indicated that Lanza was interested in mass killings, played violent video games and had books that dealt with death. 

State police reports also included descriptions of Lanza's disturbing childhood writings, his access to his mother's legally owned guns and his mental health troubles and sporadic treatment.

Home: Despite being handed over to Newtown, the home of Nancy Lanza would be valued as part of the estate should the parents of 10 children killed in Newtown sue  

Days after the killings, lawyer Irving Pinsky asked a state agency for permission to sue the state for $100 million on behalf of an unnamed 6-year-old survivor of the massacre, saying state officials failed to shield his client from foreseeable harm. 

Pinsky withdrew the request days later.
