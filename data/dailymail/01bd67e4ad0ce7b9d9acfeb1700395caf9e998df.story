A Miami boy who as electrocuted to death just days after his seventh birthday lives on as celebrities pose with a self portrait he drew month before his death.

Though Calder Sloan was killed April 13 due to a faulty underwater light in his family's pool, he's since posed--at least in spirit--with celebrities like Miami Heat center Chris Bosh, Senator Bill Nelson and the national ABC News team.

He's also traveling the world thanks to the social media campaign started by a family friend that's urged strangers to snap Mr. Awesome in places from the Hollywood Sign to a plane en route to Panama.

Paying tribute to Mr Awesome: Calder Sloan, 7, was killed when faulty wiring in his family's swimming pool electrocuted him in early April. Now a self-portrait he drew months before his death has become a viral sensation bearing his family nickname

High praise: Calder's colorfully scribbled face has touched so many so deeply that it adorned the facade of American Airlines Arena in his hometown of Miami

The heartwarming tribute to a vibrant, constantly smiling little boy was hatched when Jim Cahill, a friend of Calder's father Chris Sloan, printed a copy of Calder's drawing and posted it to Facebook.

Cahill urged his friends on the social network to do the same.

Before anyone realized, Calder's drawing, along with its new Mr. Awesome title, which comes from the boy's family nickname, had become a viral sensation.

Now the little boy is traveling the world and inspiring some seriously famous folks to pay tribute to him, much to the surprise and joy of his still devastated family.

The sentiment is huge and almost enough to match the sheer horror of the freak accident that took his Calder's life.

Calder
 was racing his nanny's adult son across the backyard pool in Miami, 
Florida when the man felt a shock in the water, leaped out and yelled 
for the boy to get out too.

But Calder, who was underwater and couldn't hear him, suddenly received a massive jolt that threw him out of the water.

Seeing America: A Sloan family friend posted the drawing on Facebook and urged his friends to print it off, take a picture and do the same. Mr Awesome has seen the desert of the Southwest and the characters of the Walk of Fame

Famous faces: Well-known folks like U.S. Senator from Florida Bill Nelson and Miami Heat superstar Chris Bosh are just a couple of the people who've honored the tragically killed boy

Widespread: Celebrities honoring Calder have spread beyond South Florida, like Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez (seen here with his daughters)

Neighbors rushed to the home and performed CPR on the boy before paramedics arrived.

Neighbor Fabian Pesantes, who was giving him CPR, told News10:
 'As I was touching the water, to wipe off my mouth, I was getting 
zapped. As I was performing CPR on the boy I was getting zapped.'

The
 boy's parents, who were visiting friends, received a call and Calder's 
father, Christopher Sloan, said he heard his wife scream, 'Is Calder 
dead?' as she ran outside.

The couple raced to Jackson North
 Medical Center, but their son had already passed.

Heartbroken: Chris Sloan spoke to reporters about his son as he stood in front of the family pool that killed him

Scene: It appears that he was shocked through a light fixture at the back of the pool that was improperly installed

Beautiful family: Calder smiles alongside his parents Chris and Carla and younger brother Caleb

Remembered: Calder, a sports lover and energetic young boy, was called 'Mr Awesome' by his family

Sloan said 
that about nine months ago, he noticed that the pool light was broken so
 they hired a contractor to fix it. Among the family's grief and the 
chaos of organizing the funeral, they have not yet tracked down the name
 of the contractor.

Calder's dip into the pool on Sunday was the first time anyone had been in in months.

North Miami requires permits and 
inspections on pool electrical work, city spokeswoman Pam Solomon said, but city building
 department records don't indicate any permits at the Sloan home.

Electricians told family members earlier this week that the light switch to the 
pool wasn't grounded properly, so power that should have
 been diverted from the pool was instead going directly into it.

'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said.
