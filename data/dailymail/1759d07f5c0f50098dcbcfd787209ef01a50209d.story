Whenever there is nothing happening, Lewis Hamilton usually provides the entertainment. He can be exceedingly good and occasionally frustrating, but he is never boring.

Bless him, because the new era of turbo-charged V6 engines began quietly here in sunny Jerez with more action in the garages than out on the track.

But just before lunchtime on the first day of this pre-season test, Hamilton left skid marks on the pit-lane after his gleaming Mercedes failed on him, and he plunged into the tyre wall at the first turn.

Lewis Hamilton also crashed out on his first day of testing with Mercedes last year.

The British driver lost control and careered into a tyre wall just 15 laps into his first session in Jerez.

According to eye witnesses, debris 
was strewn along the straight. It was estimated Hamilton was travelling 
at 160mph when his machinery disintegrated.

'Front-wing
 failure,' confirmed Mercedes spokesman Bradley Lord, soon after a truck
 had transported the damaged chassis back to the team's spanner 
collection. 'The cause is being investigated.'

That
 was Hamilton's 18th and inescapably final lap of the day. Mercedes' 
'Keep Fighting' message to Michael Schumacher, who lies in a coma after a
 skiing accident at the end of last year, was seen no more.

Uninjured
 himself, Hamilton spoke later, looking downbeat. He periodically 
displays this countenance, not always for a reason that is obvious. 
Perhaps the car was not as good as he had hoped, perhaps he was annoyed 
to be sitting out the session. Who knows? His answers were unrevealing.

To
 the chagrin of his team, the headline news was Hamilton's smash, 
whereas, in fact, their car was encouragingly the first to run and, 
despite the setback, they completed more laps than any rival bar 
Ferrari, for whom Kimi Raikkonen was the quickest performer of the day.

It
 was a day of very limited running: the teams combined completed just 93
 laps, compared to 657 on the equivalent day last year.

McLaren
 and Marussia did not turn a wheel in anger, and Red Bull's world 
champion Sebastian Vettel managed just three laps as dusk fell, none of 
them timed, after 'a silly mistake' delayed their progress.

Fitting
 the new powertrains, complete with their mind-bending energy recovery 
systems, was clearly proving a tricky task for all concerned. McLaren, 
who suffered an electrical problem, are rotating shifts of workers 
through the dark of night. Cups of coffee and bags of nuts are at the 
ready.

But, on the 
upside, the significant change in rules mean that Formula One is at the 
cutting-edge of technology again, where it belongs.  Other than the lack
 of action, there were two major debating points here.

Leading the way: The returning Kimi Raikkonen was fastest on the opening day of winter testing

The
 first was over the shape of the new noses. Ugly, say some, but do they 
really frighten the horses? I think we'll become accustomed to them in 
time.

More concerning 
was the view of Adrian Newey, Red Bull's design guru, who thinks that 
the lower snouts could be dangerous. He said: 'Cars now can effectively 
"submarine". If you hit the back of a car square on then you go 
underneath and you end up with a rear crash structure in your face.'

The second debate was over the sound of the new engines: loud or enough or not? Nobody drove flat out on Tuesday so
 we did not get the full answer, but, still, they are definitely quieter
 (as was inevitable because sound energy is now being recycled rather 
than emitted as a banshee scream as it was on the old 2.4litres petrol 
engines).

The result 
is a resonant growl in a lower register. There is a hint of an old, 
chain smoker's throaty rasp to it. I prefer the new 'music' and it is 
undoubtedly less injurious to one's eardrums.
