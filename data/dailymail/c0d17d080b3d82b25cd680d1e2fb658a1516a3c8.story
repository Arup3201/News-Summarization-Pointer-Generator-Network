The body of one of the two men who were allegedly 'ejected' from their boat while cruising in an aligator-filled Florida lake was found on Wednesday.

Police reported the body of boater Jason Cobb, 30, was discovered but they did not disclose the condition the body was in or if there was any evidence that the dangerous animals were involved in his death.

They have still not found any trace of his friend Charlie Jackson who went missing at the same time around 1.30am on Saturday.

The boat was found abandoned about 12 
hours after the two men are thought to have went missing, and the Orlando Sentinel reports that two life jackets, paddles, keys to their 
truck and beer were all found on board.

Police have not yet run toxicology 
reports on Mr Cobb's body to tell if he had been drinking at the time. Two of the beer cans found on board were unopened and there was one that had been partly opened when police arrived.

Cobb's body was found at 5pm on Wednesday in an area of water near Bird Island that is about six-feet deep.

Mr Jackson's father Bill, 55, admitted: 'It doesn't look real good for them. I'm just facing reality.'

Family members said the two missing men had attended a bachelor party before heading out on the lake after midnight on Saturday.

The group launched Mr Jackson's 15ft Bass Tracker boat from the marina at Black Hammock Adventures in Seminole County about 1am, said Joy Hill, an Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman.

The boat was found Saturday afternoon undamaged and with the keys in the ignition in cattails less than a mile north of the fish camp, near Bird Island.

'It appears they may have been ejected from the vessel,' Hill said in a statement.

Lt Hudson said Sunday's search concentrated on the wooded northwest shoreline near where a family friend found the fishing boat in a 'weeded area'

Authorities have searched the lake using helicopters, boats with sonar technology, and ATVs.

He also said the family was briefed about the search efforts, which could transition into a recovery mission.

Lt Hudson confirmed that Mr Cobb and Mr Jackson attended a gathering at the Black Hammock fishing camp prior to setting off on the water.

The camp is a popular tourist attraction and private boat ramp for locals in a rural section of Seminole County. It includes a full bar, restaurant, wildlife exhibit and offers air boat tours.

Lt Hudson would not say if the two men had been drinking.

The sheriff said: The men left from Black Hammock (Adventures) Fish Camp about 1am on Saturday, headed to Lemon Bluff in Osteen but didn't make it

Lt Hudson said: 'We've done the water search, and right now we're focusing our efforts on the shore, where the vessel was found.'

Family members said the gathering was a bachelor party. The weather that night was wet and stormy with temperatures in the mid-60s, according to the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Temperatures tumbled overnight.

About 1am, the men headed home toward Lemon Bluff boat ramp in Volusia County near Osteen, where Mr Cobb lives.

The boat was turned over to family Saturday once investigators determined it held no evidentiary value for the search.

Asked about the threat of alligators, Hudson said it is unlikely the reptiles were out because cold temperatures sends them into underwater caves to stay warm. He said they go into a hibernation-like state and don't eat or hunt as much during the winter.

Officials were more concerned about the cold weather. Hudson said if the men are still out there they may have succumbed to the effects of hypothermia as overnight temperatures the last two nights dropped to the low 40s and near freezing with wind-chill factors.

'We deal with possibilities and probabilities. It's possible they're still alive, yes,' Lt Hudson told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Is it probable? I don't know.'

Family members did not want to talk about either of the men and said they simply wanted to continue the search.

'We really don't have much to say. We are tired and just want some peace', one family member said.
