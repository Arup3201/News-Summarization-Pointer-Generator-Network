Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on how much of a 'proper bloke' he thinks Stoke City's Steve Sidwell is and how impressed he was with the atmosphere when his Barnet side visited Bristol Rovers' Memorial Stadium last week.

BIG TIME CHARLIES

How refreshing it was when I visited White Hart Lane, having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade in a private box, to bump into Stoke City midfielder Steve Sidwell.

He is not short of money, played for endless Premier League clubs and had just had a good win at Tottenham Hotspur.

We walked towards each other in a corridor of the stadium, him with his Stoke City tracksuit on, and he said, 'Well done at Barnet. I see you're six points clear.'

Allen thought that Sidwell was a 'proper, humble bloke' after having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade

I thought what a proper bloke and a proper man he was. The majority of top players earning fortunes are big-time and forget their roots. Sidwell is humble, hard-working and a decent person.

It only seems like yesterday I saw him play for Arsenal reserves at Barnet's old Underhill ground on a Tuesday night against Southampton. I remember he got a yellow card for a crunching tackle on a young Saints midfield player.

Sidwell stood out from the rest of that Arsenal team, not only for his ginger hair but for his tenacious tackling which set him aside from all the nice footballers in the Gunners side. He is a top professional.

MITCH IS MAKING MOVES AT SPURS

I gave Paul Mitchell, who has just been appointed Tottenham's head of recruitment, his first job after his playing career was so cruelly ended.

Mitch is old school, from up north, who tells it as it is. He was a tough-tackling midfielder and I'm sure over the next couple of years they will recruit players to put more steel through the spine of Spurs' team.

Mitch was a player of mine at MK Dons. He was an old-fashioned central midfield player, a steady up-and-downer. But one Saturday afternoon, 10 yards in front of me in the dugout, he was involved in a horror tackle and was rushed to hospital.

That night, I arrived at the hospital and the orthopaedic consultant called me in, pulled the curtain and told me the injury that Mitch had received was similar to the impact of a car crash.

His ankle where it met his shin bones was mashed up and he told me there and then that he wouldn't play again.

Round the corner was his mum and dad and his lovely wife. His contract was up at the end of the season and they were yet to hear the news.

We decided not to tell him and not to tell them and Pete Winkelman, the MK Dons chairman, promised me that we would give Mitch another year on his contract to help him recover.

Within that time through his rehab and recovery he would start work doing opposition analysis, which turned out to be his pathway forward as he couldn't play again.

RAMBUNCTIOUS ROVERS SUPPORTERS

I've been lucky enough to visit a few Premier League games over the past six months, but very few can match the atmosphere and passion of Bristol Rovers supporters when we visited the Memorial Stadium on Tuesday last week.

In what was biblical rain, seven-and-a-half thousand turned up and sung their hearts out saluting every tackle, challenge and refereeing decision like it was a Champions League final, FA Cup final and Premier League title decider rolled into one.

After relegation out of the Football League on the final day of last season, they could've turned their backs, but it looks like it's made them even stronger.

ALLEN'S ANALYSIS 

Player I keep hearing about... Harry Beautyman.

I've been watching an attacking-midfield player for three years since I went to see Sutton United against Basingstoke to scout them ahead of my Notts County side meeting them in the FA Cup.

I picked out a boy that night who was skinny but energetic, athletic and enthusiastic for the game. He caught my eye back then and recently he played against us for Welling United and once again attracted my attention. He was such a danger in the final third and I put him on my list to get next summer.

Then that crafty Barry Fry goes and signs him for Peterborough United on loan last week. Keep an eye out for Harry Beautyman.

One thing I'd change about... The reputation of lower league football...

People say lower-level football is fading, but I don't agree. We're still in touch with supporters, it's more affordable for the general paying public and the old adage that is kick-and-rush is a complete load of b******. There are good coaches, good managers and the Vanarama Conference is a great league to be involved in.

Allen does not believe lower-level football is fading - he thinks the supporters are still enjoying it

THE BIG ISSUE 

Having watched Tottenham against Stoke, many of the Spurs supporters were saying that Mauricio Pochettino is not the answer and they need a new manager. Gordon Bennett, I thought, he's taken over and inherited players who lack character and guts. The spine of the team is like weak orange squash.

There's no tenacity, very little fire, and nothing for the Tottenham supporters to shout about.

Yeah it's lovely being able to kick the ball with your leg going round the back of your other leg, whatever move they call it, but playing 40 games up and down the country week-in and week-out, tracking full backs, competing man-for-man, and the supporters and owners must be shaking their head at the shocking recruitment.

It's no wonder Paul Mitchell has been brought in from Southampton.
