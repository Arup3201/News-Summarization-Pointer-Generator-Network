Interpol and Thai police are trying to locate two English schoolgirls who have gone missing while visiting their mother in Thailand.

Interpol have now put out an alert and Thai police have issued an arrest warrant for their 33-year-old mother on suspicion of abducting her daughters.

Alina and Annie Day, aged ten and six, went missing on June 1 while visiting their mother in Pattaya, Thailand.

The pair, who live with English father Robert Day in Sevenoaks, Kent, were reported missing when their mother Onwarat Gamlem failed to return them to their dad, who was granted full custody in a 2010 divorce settlement.

Police and Interpol are now hunting Gamlem - formerly known as Wiganda Day and Onwarat Suphikunphong - on suspicion of abducting her daughters.

According to Thai sources, the woman claimed she had taken her daughters to the zoo but a visit to her home revealed she had fled, removing SIM cards from iPads and mobile phones to avoid detection.

Police and 
embassy officials are concerned for the well-being of Annie and Alina, 
along with their three-year-old half-brother, Marvin, who is also 
missing..

Interpol is said to be aware of the situation and appeals have been made across Thailand for the children's safe return.

The girls' father, 48-year-old Robert Day, is still believed to be in Thailand helping the search for his missing daughters.

The girls' school confirmed they had not been in lessons since before the start of the May half term.

They are pupils at Sundridge and Brasted Church of England Primary School, in Sundridge, Kent.

Friends took to Facebook to express their shock about the kidnapping with some speculating that the breakup of Robert's marriage to Gamlem four years ago may have broken down after she tried to sellÂ  their daughters to him.

Friend Sharon Saunders, from Sheffield, wrote: 'Rob is an amazing dad.

'Since his ex-wife walked out on him leaving the girls behind, he has loved and raised them.

'His mum and dad even moved in to help to bring up the girls. They have been living in a close and loving family and will be traumatised and frightened at not having seen or heard from their dad.

'They have never been away from him before since the day they were born. Rob is heartbroken and so are their grandma and grandpa.'
