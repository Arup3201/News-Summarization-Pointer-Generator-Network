Manchester United have spoken to Sporting Lisbon about central midfielder William Carvalho as the ailing club try to beef up their squad before the transfer window closes on Monday.

Manager Louis van Gaal needs reinforcements after a desperate start to the season that has seen his team take just a point from two Barclays Premier League games and crash out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 at League One MK Dons.

The Dutchman is keen on a deal for Juventus and Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal, but United are also in contact with Sporting about Carvalho after the Portuguese club dropped their asking price to £23.8million.

It is unlikely United will buy both players and chief executive Ed Woodward is concerned rival clubs will try to take advantage of United’s crisis by demanding inflated prices.

He is also aware he has competition for Carvalho from Arsenal, who can offer the Portugal star European football.

However, Van Gaal has made his needs clear in recent days and Woodward has permission from owners the Glazers to spend big once again after the British record £60m paid by United to Real Madrid for Angel di Maria this week.

United only concluded a deal with Lisbon for defender Marcos Rojo last week and have concerns about getting involved again after the protracted nature of that deal.

Equally, though, they have concerns over Vidal’s knee after it needed surgery last season and they at least know their good relationship with Portuguese agent Jorges Mendes could help them get a deal done for 22-year-old Carvalho.

Meanwhile, United have interest in Tom Cleverley and Danny Welbeck from ‘five or six’ clubs and either could leave before Monday. Welbeck, understandably, would prefer to go to a club at the top end of the league while Cleverley may choose to run his contract down.

United also have offers for Japan playmaker Shinji Kagawa but perhaps unsurprisingly are struggling to move on Brazilian failure Anderson.

The club will officially unveil Di Maria on Thursday and he will go straight into the team for Saturday’s game at Burnley.
