The CIA is part-funding a $600,000 study to find out whether it can control the weather using geoengineering.

It is backing the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) study to investigate whether geoengineering - such as solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal - could be used to curb the effects of climate change.

According to NAS, the study will look at 'a limited number of proposed geoengineering techniques' and is funded by the CIA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well a NASA, The Independent reported.

The CIA is part-funding a $600,000 study to find out whether they can control the weather using geoengineering - perhaps stopping dramatic weather such as this lightening storm in Chicago

The purpose of the study is to look 'generally on the potential impacts of 
deploying these technologies, including possible environmental, 
economic and national security concerns,' according to the NAS website.

The CIA told U.S. news website Mother Jones: 'It's natural that on a subject like 
climate change the Agency would work with scientists to better 
understand the phenomenon and its implications on national security.'

Geoengineering is a controversial idea 
that involves the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth's climatic 
system with the aim of combating global warming- in this case to change the weather.

One of the techniques, solar radiation management is purely theoretical at the moment.

The idea is to reflect sunlight in a bid to block infrared radiation, which some scientists think could stop temperatures rising.

There has been much speculation over the years as to whether the U.S. government is interested in geoengineering and has set its sights on manipulating the weather, according to The Independent.

Weather manipulation is a particularly contentious in the U.S. after commentators have claimed that huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as Oklahoma (pictured), were actually deliberately made by the US government using the Harrp antenna in Alaska

There are claims that it has controlled the weather before, including rumours that they tried to cloud-seed during the Vietnam war, by spraying substances into the air to produce artificial clouds that resulted in rain or snow.

It has been reported that the Chinese government has seeded clouds in territories that were suffering severe droughts, to force it to rain.

It was claimed that they also seeded clouds ahead of the 2008 Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing to divert rain to other places.

They also reportedly fired iodine crystals into rain clouds over the city to ensure that inclement weather did not ruin the big event.

Weather manipulation is presently particularly contentious in the U.S. after commentators accused the government of deliberately creating huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as Oklahoma.

They claim that the huge weather events were conjured up using the Harrp antenna park in Alaska.

China has previously made artificial rain (pictured) in northern provinces to fight a severe drought as well as reportedly at the Beijing Olympics to ensure a sunny ceremony
