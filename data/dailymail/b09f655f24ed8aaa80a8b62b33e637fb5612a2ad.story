Liam Plunkett took almost as much pride in his maiden Test half-century as the two wickets in two balls that kept England in the second Test.

Plunkett, who was dismissed off the last ball of the day at Headingley when he first acted as nightwatchman against Sri Lanka, this time showed the batting style which marks him out as bowling all-rounder material.

‘I take pride in my batting, I love to bat,’ said Plunkett, who volunteered to go in ahead of Matt Prior on Friday night with the new ball imminent. ‘I started out as a batsman at junior level and I still work hard at it.

‘Last night I was trying to line it up and was prepared to take one on the body if necessary but then I had the freedom to play my shots. It’s great to get a 50.

‘I’m absolutely over the moon with it.

‘I’ve been working hard to be honest with you. I’ve felt good with the bat all year and I’ve been working on some stuff. Last night when I came in as nightwatchman I worked really hard on lining it up and I felt in good nick and then came out in the morning a little bit more confident.’

Plunkett, who has been used mainly as an enforcer in his second coming for England, admitted that he got it wrong in the first innings when he was culpable as India scored at least a hundred more than they should have on a green pitch.

‘I’m an aggressive bowler and that’s how I got back in the team and I didn’t want to take that away from myself because if I did, I’d just bowl little swingers,’ said Plunkett. ‘But I got my lengths wrong in the first innings. I adjusted second time around and bowled a lot better.’

But Plunkett regretted wasting Saturday afternoon’s opportunity to claim a hat-trick - his third such chance in Tests this season.

‘I guess the lesson is not to bowl a wide one like that,’ said Plunkett. ‘I was just trying to be aggressive but I got my line wrong.’

Plunkett was a member of the Yorkshire attack who conceded 472 in the final innings to a Chris Rogers-inspired Middlesex as they lost a remarkable championship game at Lord’s this season.

He was adamant on Saturday night that this pitch will get better for batting as the Test continues.

‘It’s still nipping around but if you get in there are runs to be had,’ said Plunkett. ‘We are willing to chase whatever we need to on this wicket.

‘We’ll come out hard again. If we get a few early ones it’s still a good pitch and still a good cricket wicket. The wicket’s only going to get better so we’ll go hard in the morning and see what happens.’

Cheteshwar Pujara, the first of Plunkett’s victims in those two balls, said India were aiming for a 350 lead but would still fancy their chances if they could set England 300 to win.

‘The bounce is very uneven, a couple are keeping low and others are kicking,’ said Pujara, in a rather different assessment of the third-day pitch to that offered by Plunkett.

‘If we bowl well I’m confident we could defend any total.’

In truth, anything more than 250 will seriously test an England side who have forgotten how to win and a nervous chase is in prospect for Cook and England over the final two days of this Test.
