A property developer says he is being hounded out of a Welsh town by anti-English racists after  his historic court house was repeatedly targeted by vandals.

Aaron Hill claims his windows have been smashed 46 times, graffiti has been daubed over his walls and people have even urinated through his letter box. 

The businessman, from Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire, bought the former magistrates court in Caernarfon, north Wales and moved in after converting it into a five-bedroom home.

English property developer Aaron Hill claims the windows of his north Wales home have been smashed 46 times by 'anti-English racists'

But the 48-year-old says he has been repeatedly targeted by an anti-English mob in the town, which is 85 per cent Welsh speaking.

The former social worker said: 'I have been told: "You need to f*** off where you belong. We don't want you here. We'll burn the place down".'

Mr Hill said he told the attackers he has Welsh heritage - his grandparents were from Abertillery, South Wales.

Mr Hill has reported the vandals to North Wales Police, saying the age range of the attackers is usually between 30 and 50

He has reported the vandals to North Wales Police, saying the age range of the attackers is usually between 30 and 50 - but there have been some who are older.

Mr Hill said: 'The oldest person I've seen break the window was about 65. He was with his wife and another couple walking down to the pub. 

'I was in the hall putting a light fitting up and he walked up to the window and put his elbow through the glass, said something in Welsh and then I got, "F***ing English" at the end of it.'

Former social worker Mr Hill has installed a firebox on the letter box at the Grade I listed property along with CCTV cameras to catch the culprits.

Mr Hill, who lives alone at the property after separating from his wife, claims the attacks have stopped after he starting displaying a Welsh flag in a downstairs window.

But he has had to pay £1,600 for replacement sash windows, Walesonline reports.

North Wales Police said they have recorded 11 incidents against Mr Hill in the last year including seven for criminal damage, two for theft and two for anti-social behaviour.

A police spokesman said: 'Local officers are aware of these incidents and have mounted operations to try and apprehend the culprits.'
