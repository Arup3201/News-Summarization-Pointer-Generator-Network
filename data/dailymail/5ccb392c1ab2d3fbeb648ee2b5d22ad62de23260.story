A 41-year-old man accused of strapping fireworks to a Pitbull and lighting them before leaving the badly-burned canine in an alley to die, has been charged.

Carlos Efrain Duarte was arrested on Thursday and charged with felony animal cruelty over last year's July 4 'prank' which left Pitbull with third-degree burns to his chest, paws and rear legs.

Police said a witness saw Duarte pull the dog out of the bed of a pickup truck and dump him in a Van Nuys, California, alley.

The tragic story made headlines across the country as the Los Angeles Police Department's Animal Cruelty Task Force worked to find the attacker.

Back in form: Indy the Pitbull has made an incredible recovery since he was brought into Westlake Village Animal Hospital with severe burns  across his body

Affectionate: Indy won over the public and his carers with his incredibly loving demeanor, in spite of the trauma he had suffered

But about seven months on, the precious pooch has made an incredible recovery and is in training to become a therapy dog.

According to Patch, a good Samaritan found the injured canine and took him to an animal shelter.

The pup spent four days at the shelter and was then turned over to the New Hope Rescue Team, which named the pooch 'Indy', short for Independence Day.

Indy was later taken to the Westlake Village Animal Hospital, where he has been rehabilitated.

KTLA-TV
 reported that veterinarians 
performed numerous surgeries and skin grafts to save Indy's life.

Everyone who worked with Indy was taken aback by his incredibly sweet demeanor, despite the violence he suffered

Veterinary technician Allison 
Polumbus, who  worked with Indy during his recovery, choked up as she
 told KTLA about his unspeakable injuries.

'It’s really hard to see an animal in this kind of pain,' she said, wiping away tears.

'We saw him without the bandages. It’s horrific, it’s gory, and you can’t even imagine the pain he’s in.'

The
 horrific abuse case, and Indy's remarkably sweet demeanor, made 
headlines around America, with more than 1,200 people following his 
progress on Facebook page, INDY.

The incredible tale of survival also inspired
 talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, who helped raise money for his care and
 visited him at the animal hospital with her wife, actress Portia de 
Rossi.

Indy has now been adopted and is in training to become a therapy dog.
