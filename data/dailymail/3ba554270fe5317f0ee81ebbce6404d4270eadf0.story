A UK seaside town has banned MTV cameras from filming wild nights out there because it does not want to be portrayed as Britain's answer to Magaluf.

Tourism bosses in Blackpool, Lancashire, revealed they have refused permission for TV show Geordie Shore to shoot footage there, as it does not want to be cast in a ‘detrimental light’.

The reality show had planned to film in pubs, clubs and strip bars before returning to more late-night drinking at their hotel.

The programme was due to be shown on MTV in Geordie Shore's ninth series.

However, the request comes after a video showing an 18-year-old girl carrying out a sex act on 24 men at a Carnage Magalluf party in Magaluf, Majorca, came to light.

The footage has sparked outrage, with local mayor Manu Onieva voicing his ‘absolute indignation’ at the video, and at the claims that it was the result of an ‘everything-goes’ party culture.

In the UK,
 Blackpool tourism bosses said allowing Georgie Shore to film wild 
nights out in the town would show the area in a 'less than savoury 
light'.

They issued a warning to club owners and the town's businesses to steer clear of the Geordie Shore cast as their 'less than savoury antics' were completely 'off message' for the resort.

Councillour Graham Cain said: 'On a daily basis we receive requests from production companies to film in Blackpool.

'As
 a town which relies on tourism we have to careful about allowing 
programmes to be filmed which may show the resort in a detrimental 
manner.

'We prefer to work with companies that appeal to our target market of families and do so on a regular basis.

'All requests are carefully considered but on this occasion we chose to refuse Lime Pictures' application for permission.'

Lime Pictures confirmed they made an enquiry to film in the resort but refused to comment on the refusal.

Geordie Shore follows the trials and tribulations of a group of young men and women from Newcastle and the North East where the show is normally set.

The last series raked in more than a million viewers on average per episode.

The council’s decision to try to make Blackpool look squeaky clean follows its down market portrayal in Channel Four's 999 What's Your Emergency series.

Hoteliers said it was hugely damaging for the town with people calling up to cancel bookings having watched the controversial show.

Meanwhile, Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner has confirmed he also featured in the Magaluf sex act video as the girl asked him whether he wanted to be 'number 25'.

The reality TV star can be seen at the end of the footage sticking his middle finger up at the blonde woman, who then walks away.

Speaking to The Mirror, he said he been taking part in the bar crawl, but had decided not to take part in the sex game, calling it 'the most shocking thing I've seen.'

'The girl was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a "holiday" if she took part in this game'
