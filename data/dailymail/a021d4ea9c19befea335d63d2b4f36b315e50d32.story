A teenager who attacked a vision-impaired pensioner on a public bus will be released from jail on Thursday after being sentenced to three years behind bars. 

Layni Cameron, 18, was sentenced at Southport District Court on Monday for attacking Paul Buttigieg, 77, on a Gold Coast bus back in February.

She was handed a three year jail sentence by Judge Tony Rafter, but having served nine months in custody she will be released on Thursday.

Cameron and her friend Larna Watmough, 21, bashed Mr Buttigieg on their way home from the races back in February.

A fellow passenger filmed the assault on the elderly man and the women were widely condemned after the footage went viral. 

In court on Monday, Cameron also pleaded guilty to a string of other charges.

At the time of the attack on Mr Buttigieg, Cameron was on bail for holding up a Surfers Paradise store with a knife.

Watmough, who pleaded guilty for her part in the vicious assault, was given a two-month suspended sentence back in September.

While handing down his sentence for Watmough, Magistrate Gary Finger labelled the pair as 'louts' and 'idiots' for their behaviour.

'You attacked a defenceless old man with impaired vision... you certainly must be proud of yourself,' he said.

'Your actions were deplorable. To say they were deplorable is an understatement.' 

Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said at the time Watmough's sentence was 'manifestly inadequate'. 

He announced the Director of Public Prosecutions would act on his behalf in Queensland's district court when he appealed her two-month sentence.

In the video, Watmough and Cameron could be seen kicking and punching Mr Buttigieg as they hurled verbal abuse at him.

Onlookers yelled for the women to stop and 'leave the poor man alone', before another male passenger eventually stepped in and forced the offenders off the bus.

The women had earlier been yelling obscenities at several passengers on the bus.

Watmough presented a handwritten note to the court during her sentencing in which she apologised to the man for the incident.

The two-page letter told of her regret about the shocking attack which also saw her receive a 12-month probation for the public nuisance charge and ordered to pay $500 in compensation. 

'If I could go back and walk off the bus I would,' the letter read.

'My actions that day were completely out of character. All (sic) though its seems like I'm that person, I can assure you that I'm not.'
