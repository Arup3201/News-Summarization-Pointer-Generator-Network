Sex is the top topic on voyeuristic site Pencourage.com, where subscribers post anonymous diary entries online

New anti-social network Pencourage, which allows users to publish anonymous diaries online, reveals a salacious peek into the country's private lives.

On subscribing, users input their postcode, which is kept private to voyeurs but has allowed the site to conduct extremely revealing research. 

The research found that Londoners’ journals on the female dominated site are three times more likely to focus on
sex than those living outside the capital.

Londoners were also nearly three times more likely to have a career
that’s disruptive to their relationship and were over four times more likely to have an
affair because of a career or with someone within the same company.

But despite certain differences, the most popular tag by the site’s 5,000 users whether they lived in or outside of London was ‘sex’.

Uploaded journals - which allow users to anonymously post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music, videos or photos - were twice as likely to discuss sex over ‘career’ and close to three times more likely to focus on sex over ‘love’ (where not relating to sex).

Sex made up 15% of all entries, half of which showed an emphasis on infidelity. New relationships were the second most popular subject matter and careers was third, appearing in just under 8% of posts.

Pencourage founder Peter Clayton explains, 'We conducted experiments using key word search on several batches of users that had known postcodes, so they could be separated into "in London" and "out of London".

'Whilst the subjects were the same: sex, relationships, career and love, the way each was discussed starkly differed.

'The biggest trend was that out of London, the top subjects were treated as quite separate items. If they talked about relationships it was about a relationship and nothing else. In London, journals of relationships included heavy references to career and sex.

'In London, sex was more often linked to infidelity, usually through work, quite often with someone from work and explained by the pressures of work.'

On Pencourage.com subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown

According to Dr. Michael Sinclair, consultant psychologist and clinical director of London-based City Psychology Group (www.citypsychology.com), 'These results confirm that women focus on sex despite the socially constructed belief that they don't as much as men.

'It is perhaps the anonymity of this site that provides them with a safe place without judgement to do so.

'It is unsurprising that those living high-pressured lives will often link other seemingly unrelated aspects with their career and job challenges.

'Given the amount of hours that people spend at work these days especially in the capital, it’s understandable that sex and romantic relationships are increasingly occurring in occupational contexts and often affecting or being affected by work.

'Furthermore, the fast paced, competitive and instant gratification culture that exists in cities coupled with more people, available options and choice clearly impact the sexual behaviour of people living and working there.'

There are already over 4.5 million words posted on the site: the equivalent of 50 average-sized novels.

USERNAME: Waiting For a Life

Extract 1: Something strange is going on

As you know, Jon (my ex) came and
stayed with me a few days whilst Hubby was away. It was so good to spend time
with Jon. It reminded me why I loved him and what we once had together and for
a millisecond I was transported back to those days and was wondering why we
split up - but I soon came to.

It seems, however, that Jon stayed in that dream state. He rang today and left
a message saying he very much likes Mr Waiting but that if I ever felt.

I was shocked and super angry. What on earth does he think he's up to? Telling
me that I am even more beautiful than before, that I am a Lady and have a
"real sophistication" doesn't mean I am going to go running to him.

Sure, he has money galore, looks that stop women in the street, manners of a
true gentleman and tastes in culture that make me want to swoon but then
there's Mr W.

Extract 2: Waiting for a life

The Pencourage homepage is bursting with secrets waiting to be read

I woke up this morning with dread
in my mind. It is such an awful feeling. It is worse than a panic attack (for
me) because it is all consuming and lasts for weeks sometimes.

I know what it is about and have looked for help to shake it off but no one
seems to be able to help. Even meditation doesn't help.

It is all about the fact that I feel like I am an empty shell, that I have
lived my life in fast forward, that it has been so packed up with experiences
that now it has come to a stand still. My childhood has consumed 'me' and there
is no way to escape the issue that I have nothing, NOTHING, to look forward to.

Oh sure I have the odd bit and bob but there is nothing that will change my
life, turn it on its head, and I seem to need that. I know I should be content
with what I have but I feel .....
I don't know. Words don't cover it.
