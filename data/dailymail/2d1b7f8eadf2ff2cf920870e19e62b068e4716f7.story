A Headmaster who ran a dating website and private health club from his school earned £390,000 in one year, MPs were told yesterday.

Sir Greg Martin pocketed £161,000 as sole director of a leisure centre that operates on his school’s site.

He also received more than £229,000 in basic salary and pension contributions as executive head, the Commons public accounts committee heard.

And bizarrely, the committee was told Sir Greg ran a dating website that has the same address as the school.

Sir Greg Martin, who had an income of almost £400,000, was accused by MPs of ‘taking his eye off the ball’

The dating business had a Twitter account featuring pictures of a woman in black underwear, the MPs were told.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said she was ‘gobsmacked’ by Sir Greg’s pay at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London.

‘You are being paid a lot of money as a headteacher. You take yourself a generous slug of money, which we believe to be public money,’ she said.

Sir Greg was challenged about dating firm The Coterie London, which he set up with friends and used the school site as a registered address

‘You then find time – with your school having been seen as excellent but now only being rated as good by Ofsted – to set up a dating agency.

‘When I looked, somebody called Saffron, who works on the Twitter account, was semi-nude with all sorts of black underwear all over the place.

‘It seems deeply inappropriate for a head teacher to do that on premises where you are also conducting educational business.’

MPs expressed disbelief at the Twitter account of 'Saffron' who was working for the dating agency

It is not known if Sir Greg makes a profit from the dating business, but the £390,000 combined package of his health club role, salary and benefits made him the best-paid school leader in the country in 2012/13.

In 2013/14 the head took home £44,000 less because his school payouts were lower than the year before.

The academy trust faces being hit with a financial notice to improve by the Education Funding Agency. The agency can bring in new staff – including a new head – if it is not satisfied.

It is concerned about the contracts that allow Sir Greg to operate the leisure centre.

The cross-party panel of MPs said the money generated from Sir Greg operating a leisure and accommodation business from the site of the school should have gone back into the education of the students.

Mrs Hodge added: ‘It was wrong to take the money. The £161,000 you made could have been used to benefit the education of children.

‘You had a perfectly good salary as a headteacher of more than £200,000.’

Sir Greg insisted the leisure business cash subsidised school lunches, evening childcare and free boarding.

MPs praised the Durand Primary School in Stockwell for its educational achievements, but questioned Sir Greg's other financial interests

He said: ‘There’s a swimming pool you wouldn’t have had, there’s a boarding school you wouldn’t have had, there’s middle schools you wouldn’t have had, there’s subsidised food, there are small classes. Are you saying that’s wrong?’

Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department for Education, said the ministry had concerns with the set-up of the leisure contract.

Sir Greg protested that MPs should not be quizzing him about his private life and private business interests

In a statement issued after the hearing, Sir Greg said Durand’s success was underpinned by private investment and he was proud that it was ‘driving aspiration and expanding choice and opportunity for children’.

Sir Greg applied to set up a state boarding school in West Sussex only for South Downs National Park to reject the proposals.

It is understood that his dating site is called The Coterie.

Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said it was wrong that Sir Greg had found time to set up a dating agency while his school was downgraded from excellent to good
