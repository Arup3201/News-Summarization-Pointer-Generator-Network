Civil rights advocates and lawyers say recent cases involving Texas State Troopers conducting roadside cavity searches with little or no cause indicate 'some sort of standard practice'.

In two recently publicized cases on opposite sides of the state, troopers have pulled over women for minor infractions - which the women often deny - and ended up conducting cavity searches.

In both incidents, the troopers' dash-cam captures the women being probed in their private parts by a female trooper summoned to the scene by the initial male officers.

Officials have deemed the searches, conducted in full view on the side of the road, unconstitutional and say that there is no official policy encouraging the searches.

But lawyers for the victims and civil rights advocates say that the fact the two incidents occurred in separate parts of the state and involved different officers indicates some kind of department complicity.

'The fact that they both happened means there is some sort of [department] policy,' Jim Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights Project told the New York Daily News.

'It’s such a prohibited practice. I don’t know why they think they can do this. It’s mind-boggling.'

Peter Schulte, an attorney and former Dallas police officer, said that the practice may have spread around the state from region to region, rather than being an order from above.

'I think the Department of Public Safety is trying to figure out who in the world trained these troopers to think that this is OK,' Schulte told the Daily News.

'The law just doesn’t support that. It just doesn’t.'

Out: State trooper David Ferrell, pictured, has been suspended after subjecting two women to invasive body cavity searches

Pulled over: The women were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas

The victims of the first invasive search, Angel 
Dobbs, 38, and her niece Ashley Dobbs, 24, filed a lawsuit against the 
two troopers and the state Department of Public Safety last December.

The
 women, from Irving, Texas, claim in the suit that they were violated when Trooper Kelly Helleson 
subjected them to a humiliating and invasive body search that was caught
 on video.

The 'unconstitutional' search took 
place in full view of passing cars on State Highway 161, near 
Irving.

Ashley and Angel Dobbs claim the trooper used the same blue 
latex gloves while searching both of them.

The women were initially pulled over by Farrell after he saw one of them throw a 
cigarette butt out the window.

Farrell can be heard in the 
disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly 
smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed 
to find any evidence of it in the car.

Despite that, he requested the women be searched because they were 'acting weird'.

Violating: Helleson, pictured left, also rubbed the women's breasts

Angel Dobbs passed a roadside sobriety test and the women were given warnings for littering.

'This has been an eye-opening experience
 for me,' Angel Dobbs said on the video. 'I've never been pulled over, never searched like this. I was 
totally violated over there a few minutes ago... this is so embarrassing
 to me.'

'They didn’t even search my socks or my shoes,' Angel Dobbs said. 'I just couldn’t fathom how you could search someone’s butt and their vagina, and not search their socks or shoes.'

The suit reads: 'Angel Dobbs was 
overwhelmed with emotion and a feeling of helplessness and reacted 
stating that Helleson had just violated her in a most horrific manner.'

The two women are also suing the 
director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steven McCraw, who 
they claim ignored previous complaints about 'unlawful strip searches, 
cavity searches and the like.'

'Unconstitutional': The search is being deemed unconstitutional in the lawsuit

The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.'

He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers.

The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life.

'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com.

Her
 niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go 
through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's 
humiliating.'

The Texas trooper who performed the 
roadside body cavity searches of two women using the same latex glove 
was indicted on charges of sexual assault and two charges of 
official oppression.

A Department of Public Safety spokesman said Friday that Helleson was fired but is appealing that decision.

The trooper who called Helleson to do the search, David Farrell, was indicted on a theft charge, according to the Dallas Morning News.

In the second case, friends Brandy Hamilton, 26, and Alexandria Randle, 24, told reporters how they were ordered out of their vehicle, not permitted to put on clothes to cover the bikinis they'd been wearing at the beach that day, and given cavity searches right by the side of the road.

The disturbing video of the event, which was caught on the dash-cam, captures one of the women asking in disbelief, 'Are you serious?' when the officers tell her they're going to give her a cavity search.

Speaking about police searching people for drugs, Brandy Hamilton said, 'If it comes to that, then take the person into jail, you don't have to do it on the side of the road.'

 The women are suing the Texas Department of Public Safety and the sheriff of Brazoria County, Texas, where the stop occurred. Their lawyer alleges that the search was meant to humiliate them and was conducted without probable cause.

Routine: Randle and Hamilton were pulled over for speeding but were then subjected to an invasive search that left them feeling violated

Disbelief: The Trooper calls for a female officer because he's not going to get near the young womens' 'woman areas'

The female officer who performed the invasive search, which included inserting a finger into the women's vaginas, is also accused of using the same pair of gloves to search both women. Attorney Allie R. Booker told MailOnline her client's case is startling similar to the Dobbs case.Booker said a third case, that has yet to become public, bears the same hallmarks as well.'How are these people behaving in the same manner, hundreds of miles away from each other. There's got to be some factor at the DPS that makes these officers think they can do this,' she said.Miss Hamilton and Miss Randle were on their way home to Houston from Surfside Beach on May 28, 2012, when they were stopped for speeding by DPS trooper Nathaniel Turner.Turner immediately asks both women to step out of their car. Both were wearing only their two-piece swimsuits from their time at the beach.Ms Hamilton, the driver, asks if she can put her dress on to cover up.

'Don't worry about it. Come out here,' the trooper tells her.

Violated: Hamilton is handcuffed despite not having committed any crime, and Officer Turner didn't allow her to cover up her bikini after  ordering her out of the car

Hard to watch: Hamilton asks, 'Do you know how violated I feel?' but the officers are clearly unconcerned

Turner says he can smell marijuana in the car and accuses the women of smoking and driving. He later claimed that he found a piece of a smoked marijuana blunt under the back seat of the car.

He then makes the two women sand on the side of a busy highway in their swimsuits while he calls for backup.

'One of them has got her zipper open on her pants of her daisy dukes shorts - whatever they are,' the trooper says on the radio. Two more troopers show up - including Jennie Bui. Bui, as trooper Turner explains, 'is going to search you.'

'I ain't, because I ain’t about to get up-close and personal with your woman areas… she is going to put some gloves on,' he says.

'You're going to go up my private parts?' asks Hamilton, sounding bewildered.

Both women can be seen with pained looks on their faces as the trooper probes their genitals. Miss Randle sobs uncontrollably as she is probed.

At one point Turner says: 'Don’t smoke weed in your car and you won’t have to go through this.'

Booker, the lawyer for the two women, said the behavior of the troopers was outrageous.

'If the cavity search alone isn't enough and say it's their fault that you basically just sexually assaulted them - that's humiliating,' she said.

Turner later released both women and issued Miss Hamilton a citation for possession of drug paraphernalia. She is still fighting the charges in court, though she contends the marijuana wasn't hers.

Trooper Bui was fired last week by the DPS. Trooper Turner has been suspended, Booker said.

'These police officers are here to protect and serve,' Brandy Hamilton told KHOU11.

'And they did not protect me at all. Not one of them.'
