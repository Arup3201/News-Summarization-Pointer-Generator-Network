The parents of a missing 6-year-old Washington have submitted to lie detector tests to help investigators and searchers looking for little Jenise Wright.

However, the results likely will not be released to the public, said Kitsap County sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson.

The tests were taken Monday night as the search continued in the east Bremerton neighborhood around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park.

Officials meeting Tuesday morning were planning their next step, Wilson said.

Where is Jenise? Kitsap County sheriff's deputies are searching for Jenise Wright, 6, who is missing and was last seen Saturday night at her home in east Bremerton, Washington

Jenise was last seen Saturday night when she went to bed. Her family noticed her missing Sunday morning but didn't become worried and call for help until that night when she failed to show up for dinner - only 24 hours later - because she had left the home on previous occasions and wandered around the neighborhood.

'My head’s just swimming, I don’t know what to think,' Jenise’s 
father, Jim Wright, told Q13 Fox. 'She went to bed, she was asleep. 
Wake up, [and I think] she’s probably out running and playing.'T

The family felt it was relatively safe because the mobile home park is fenced, Wilson said.

The search began early Monday and grew to involve about 100 searchers from ten agencies including three dog teams in the neighborhood and surrounding wooded area.

Their job Tuesday is checking all 103 homes in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park. Local police are also interviewing registered sex offenders in the area, the Bremerton Patriot reported.

Meanwhile, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home of the Wright family.

The little girl's disappearance was being called a missing person case with 'suspicious circumstances,' Wilson said. Most missing children would have surfaced by now, he said.

The investigation now includes the FBI, Washington State Patrol and detectives from nearby police agencies.

They are 'looking at the entire spectrum of possibilities: Has the child sustained an accident? Has the child been abducted? Has the child come to harm?' Wilson said.

The FBI has resources 'that we can only dream about — investigative tools, personnel that specialize in child abduction,' Wilson said. 'We're not calling it an abduction, but why not get those resources early on, examine all the possibilities.'

The two parents live in the home in a blended family. The 8-year-old and 12-year-old were the only other children in the home last weekend. A 16-year-old boy was out of town. Two others at the home are adults.

Other residents in the park described Jenise as outgoing and unafraid to talk to anyone.

'She's really independent, she's tenacious,' the little girl's father, James Wright, told KOMO-TV, describing the neighborhood as safe and saying his daughter roamed the park.

Jenise is described as 3 feet tall, weighs 45lbs and has black hair. She'll be a first-grader this school year. She shared a bedroom with her sister.
