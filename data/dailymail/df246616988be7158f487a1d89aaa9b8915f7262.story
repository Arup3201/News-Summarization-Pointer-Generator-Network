Paul Scholes has criticised Jose Mourinho's touchline behaviour and believes the Chelsea manager's antics are counter-productive to his team's ambitions.

Citing Mourinho's constant berating of officials in the Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool, Scholes argued that Sir Alex Ferguson was far better at managing games from his technical area.

The United legend, who spent his entire club career playing for Ferguson, argues in his Independent column that Mourinho is doing himself and his team no favours.

Scholes writes: 'There were many games over my career for Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson would get out his seat and come into the technical area to have his say if he believed that an intervention needed to be made, or a point expressed to a referee.

'People like to think it happened all the time but, believe me, in 19 years playing for him you recognised that he knew how to pick his moment.

'Watching Chelsea against Liverpool on Tuesday night, my feeling was not so much that Jose Mourinho was looking for the opportune moments to appeal against a decision or make his presence felt. Rather for most of that 90 minutes, and the 30 minutes of extra-time that followed, Mourinho seemed to be under the impression that it was him who was refereeing the game.

'The funny thing is, that the more Mourinho does it, the more that referees will be inclined to ignore him. If you spend an entire game jabbering away at an official you will very soon acquire a reputation as an annoyance best ignored. The whole process is counter-productive.'

Scholes added: 'No-one doubts that Mourinho has a fine record as a coach, with two Champions League titles and the possibility of winning a third Premier League with Chelsea this season. The refereeing of matches he can safely leave to someone else.'
