The delay in Raheem Sterling signing a new contract with Liverpool coincides with big changes at Impact Sports Management, who represent the England star.

Agent Aidy Ward is in the process of leaving Impact to set up his own business and is taking Sterling and West Brom striker Saido Berahino with him. Another England international, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain of Arsenal, may follow.

There has been speculation for some time that Ward, who works closely with that trio, would break away from the Rob Segal-run operation. Ward’s new company will also have athletics and boxing clients. Rising British heavyweight hope Anthony Joshua, an Olympic gold medallist, was linked with Ward before he turned professional.

There will be short-term complications in any new deal involving Sterling or Berahino because of their current representation contracts with Impact, who look after nearly 200 players.

But Segal said: ‘Everything is being worked out between myself and Aidy in a very amicable fashion, despite some in our industry suggesting otherwise. Aidy wants to go it alone and I can understand the reasons but we will continue to work together when it suits us.’

With most of the negativity about Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup coming from the powerful UK press, the organising committee hope a British candidate emerges from the global recruitment search for their World Cup communications director to be based in Doha.

UEFA look to be playing a highly tactical game over the FIFA presidential election since Michel Platini declared he was not going to challenge Sepp Blatter. But instead of supporting another candidate, UEFA are happy both Dutchman Michael van Praag and Prince Ali of Jordan  are standing as they want as much anti-Blatter noise as possible over the next four months.

Meanwhile it is likely that Blatter’s stooge candidate Jerome Champagne will get the five nominations he needs to contest the race because the Swiss will want one friendly rival in the mix whom he can control. The FA are expected to support Prince Ali even with Van Praag deciding to stand and Chile’s Harold Mayne-Nicholls another possibility.

London 2012’s organising committee gained the name ‘NOCOG’ because of their frequent refusal to be linked to parallel events owing to the restrictions on using the Olympic brand. So the legion of LOCOG alumni now working for England rugby 2015 have tried to be more accommodating for the Rugby World Cup by setting up a separate Festival of Rugby 2015 with its own logo and branding.

Sky deadline revamp

Sky Sports News are making much-needed changes to their transfer deadline day coverage after the fiasco of the last window. Two reporters had to seek sanctuary inside grounds from fans’ protests, while sex aids were brandished by mischievous supporters in front of the cameras at two other chaotic venues.

This time around SSN, who go ludicrously over the top at the end of the transfer window, intend to make next Monday more of a studio-based day. This will involve many of their leading pundits analysing the day’s events, plus more news of deals across Europe. Sky are asking clubs to allow their reporters to deliver their frequent updates from inside the grounds so any demos or exhibitionist behaviour can be avoided. However, Sky will not say how many Premier League outfits have agreed to let them in.

Meanwhile, with Sky believing they invented deadline day TV coverage, BT Sport are sure to antagonise them with their ‘mellow yellow’ promo featuring Robbie Savage that lampoons Sky’s colour motif on the day. However, after stirring things up, BT need to prove themselves by breaking some transfer news.

Mark Pougatch's arrival at ITV as their lead football presenter next month is timely. ITV are in the process of gaining World Cup cricket highlights for terrestrial showing, and Pougatch has hosted ITV’s IPL cricket coverage. However the World Cup action is likely to come as a self-contained package and will not be presenter led.
