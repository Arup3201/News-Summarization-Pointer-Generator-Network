He lives for his four children so it's hardly surprising that David Beckham loves showing off the tattoos he has dedicated to them.

In his new fragrance campaign, the footballer proudly showcases his ink inscription to his daughter Harper.

The inking sits just above his tattoo
 of Jesus being carried by three cherubs, which are meant to symbolise 
sons Brooklyn, 12, Romeo, eight and Cruz, six.

Phwoar! David Beckham looks chiselled in his new advert for his fragrance, Intense Instinct, and ensures that his ink tributes to his children are on show

Beckham
 said at the time: ‘It’s Jesus being carried by three cherubs and 
obviously the cherubs are my boys and so my thought of it is that at 
some point my boys are going to need to look after me and that’s what 
they’re doing in the picture. It means a lot.’

The 38-year-old looks chiselled as he poses topless in the new shot for his fragrance, Intense Instinct. 

'Inspired by David’s sharp judgement, self-belief and his ability to overcome any obstacle, Intense Instinct is an aromatic and fruity fragrance that will inspire any style-conscious, focused and driven man,' reads the fragrance's description.

David said: 'Intense Instinct is an invigorating and contemporary fragrance for men with green, luminous notes and woody undertones.

'I believe it’s important to trust your instincts in life and this has inspired this new limited edition of my fragrance.'

David Beckham has been the top selling 
male celebrity fragrance since 2006 with the launch of his eponymous 
scent.

Since then Superdrug has sold over 1.5 million bottles bearing 
Beckham’s name. Until now.

It’s a battle of the boys in the £400m+ UK male fragrance market as Beckham sees the first serious challenger to his fragrance empire in the form of hip hop icon Jay Z.

Since launching on Valentine’s Day this year, Jay Z’s fragrance debut, GOLD JAY Z, has outsold Beckham’s latest scent by 8:1, based on two weeks of sales for both launches.

Superdrug even predict that Gold Jay Z will be the biggest male fragrance launch of the year, with multi-million pound revenues.

And it seems that sweet success runs in the family with Beyonce's Rise fragrance topping Mother's Day gift lists.
