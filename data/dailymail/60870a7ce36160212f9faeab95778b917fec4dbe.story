Two siblings and best friends discovered they were pregnant on the same day - and gave birth on the same day nine months later.

Step-sisters Lydia Crispin and Dawn Bamber - who also share a birthday of April  1 - each discovered they were mothers-to-be by chance on June 18 last year.

And the pair both gave birth to their daughters on February 28 this year -  despite both having different due dates.

Step-sisters Lydia Crispin and Dawn Bamber each discovered they were mums-to-be by chance on June 18 last year and both gave birth to their daughters on February 28 this year

It means the next generation of their family will be able to celebrate their  birthday together - just like best friends Lydia and Dawn, of Euxton, Lancs.

Lydia, 24, who lives with husband Danny, said: 'I had spoken to Dawn, because I  always confide in her, and told her I was thinking of having a baby. She said she had been thinking about it too. We said we would always tell each  other if anything happened.

'On June 18, I did a pregnancy test and found out it was positive, and the  first person I phoned was Dawn. 

'That night, she texted me to see if I was still awake and if she could phone  me. She was crying her eyes out and told me she was pregnant.'

They decided not to tell anyone until after their scans and got their parents,  Sue and Keith Bamber, together for a family meal.

Despite both having different due dates, they beat the odds, which means the next generation of their family will be able to celebrate their birthday together - just like they did

They told them they had won a prize and presented each parent with a gift bag  containing a picture of the babies from the scans.

The step-sisters went through pregnancy together, sharing each milestone and  preparing for the future. They both planned to give birth at Chorley And South Ribble Hospital, Lancs.,  with Dawn's baby due on February 15 and Lydia's on February 20.

Dawn, 25, who is engaged to Duncan Riding, said: 'It was unbelievable. I didn't  think for a minute that they would arrive on the same day.'

Both pregnancies went past their due dates and plans were made for Dawn's baby  to be induced at Royal Preston Hospital, Lancs., on February 28. And the day before, Lydia went into labour at Chorley Hospital.

Baby Summer was born at 12.30am on February 28, weighing 7lb 12oz and Dawn's daughter Courtney was delivered at 7.50pm that day, weighing 10lb 11oz

Lydia said: 'I was looking at the clock at 11.30pm hoping it would go into the  next day, because I knew Dawn was being induced.'

Baby Summer was born at 12.30am on February 28, weighing 7lb 12oz. And Dawn's daughter Courtney was delivered at 7.50pm that day, weighing 10lb  11oz.

Lydia said: 'When we finally got the phone call to say she had had a little  girl, we were over the moon.

'For our girls to have the same birthday, like us, is lovely. They will grow up  together and probably go to the same school.'  Dawn, who works at Cheeky Monkey's play centre in Chorley, added: 'I think they  will be best friends like me and Lydia.'

Experts say the odds of two sisters discovering they are pregnant and giving  birth on the same days are a million to one.
