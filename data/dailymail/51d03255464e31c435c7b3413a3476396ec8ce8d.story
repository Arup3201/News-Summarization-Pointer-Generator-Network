A sporty 28-year-old woman with an existing heart condition died after suffering a fatal heart attack at the wheel of her car while driving to a party.

Jemma Rozier, 28, from Swindon Village in Gloucestershire, was found slumped in the driver's seat of her car at a junction.

Paramedics were called and she was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save her.

Her heartbroken mother Clare, 49, said: 'It shouldn't be this way round. Devastation is the first thing that hits you.

'We were talking about her finding a husband and having children. 

'She was just a normal 28-year-old living her life.'

Tragedy struck after Ms Rozier left her family home and headed to a party at around 8.45pm on March 14.

She was found unconscious in her car just a few miles away by a passer-by who dialled 999.

Ms Rozier, who worked at Capita Insurance in Bishop's Cleeve, was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors could not save her.

The keen sportswoman had a 'floppy valve' due to a heart condition but lived an active life and had shown no signs of ill health before the incident.

She was a Brownie leader in Guiting Power, a keen cyclist and had recently taken up salsa dancing.

Her mother added: 'She'd had regular check-ups and everything was fine.

'She was fun-loving. She was very keen on fitness. She cycled everywhere and went running with me. We're all runners in the family.

'I don't think many people probably knew about her heart condition, because it didn't restrict her.

'Never once was it a problem for her. It was a complete shock.'

Her father Edward, 54, said: 'It was all so surreal until we went through and saw Jemma. We went through the motions but it just didn't seem real.'

Jemma leaves behind her younger sister, Natalie, 25, who recently returned from a 13-month trip around Australia, New Zealand and America.

Natalie, a fitness instructor, said: 'She meant the world to me. We were best friends as well as sisters.'

Jemma's funeral takes place 2.30pm Friday March 27 at St Michael's Church in Guiting Power.

The mitral valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber, and helps control blood flow through the heart.

During each heartbeat the smaller upper chambers of the heart contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers.

The mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium, and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood, to prevent backflow.

When the valve closes, its two leaflets (flaps) normally seal the valve shut. 

Tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side.

Problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body. 

Severe problems can lead to heart failure - which is where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced.

There are three main types of problem:

- Mitral regurgitation (also called 'mitral incompetence') – where there is a backflow of blood through the valve, often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse

- Mitral stenosis – where the valve doesn't open as wide as it should, restricting blood flow

- Mitral valve prolapse - where one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and don't close tightly, often leading to backflow of blood 

These conditions can each occur alone or in combination.
