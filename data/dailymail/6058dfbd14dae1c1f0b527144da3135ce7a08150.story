We are more accustomed to seeing him speed around the Silverstone track in a super car.

But Lewis Hamilton  has added another string to his bow by turning model for designer fashion site Mr Porter this week.

The 28-year-old Formula One racing driver has stepped out from behind the wheel to pose in a sultry shoot around the famous track for the site's latest digital magazine.

The young sports star poses in casual knits and denim jackets at the place he feels most at home and speaking about his personal style, he said: 'I try not to make it difficult for people. But when you put something on, you’ve got to feel comfortable in it, and comfortable being seen in it.

'It’s like a new layer of skin.'

But fashion aside, there's only one thing on his mind: a win at this weekend's British Grand Prix.

It may have been five years since Lewis shot to stardom on the race track at the tender age of 22, but he is still keen to prove he's a force to be reckoned with.

Particularly after the public have hit out to say that he has lost his focus due to spending too much time in the recording studio focusing on his music, as well as a certain high-profile relationship with the glamorous Nicole 
Scherzinger.

Speaking ahead of this weekend's challenge, the notoriously competitive star said: 'I’m still hungry.'

And it seems that his social life takes a back seat in favour of his success.

'I haven’t been out to a club for a year
 and a half and that might seem strange for a guy in his 
20s, but for me I feel that’s just the path that I’m on.

'That’s what I 
need to do right now to stay focused,' he said.

With the Mercedes driver tipped to lead the British charge this weekend, Lewis has spoken out to say victory in the British GP is the 'ultimate' achievement on the F1 calendar.

He even likened winning at Silverstone to lifting the World Championship.

He is the last Briton to have claimed a home victory at Silverstone in 2008 driving for McLaren.
