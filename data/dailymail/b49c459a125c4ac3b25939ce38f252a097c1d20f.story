Oscar Pistorius was allegedly looking at pornographic websites the night his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was shot and killed, it has been suggested today.

The paralympian used his mobile phone, which was recovered at his home in Pretoria, to access the material online, reports from in the South African media suggest.

A document, believed to be court papers leaked from the investigation, are thought to state data from the phone shows he would have visited the sites while Ms Steenkamp was in the building.

The document goes on to state the sites are in 'direct contrast to that of a loving couple spending their time together', it is alleged.

The reports come two days after it was claimed neighbours heard screams in between gunfire on the night Ms Steenkamp was killed.

Court documents suggest a final round of shots ‘extinguished’ the screams, it is believed.

On Valentines day 2013, Pistorius is alleged to have shot the model four times 
through a locked bathroom door of his home in a gated community in Pretoria.

Pistorius denies the charge of murder and says he thought his girlfriend was an intruder.

He goes on trial on March 3.

Pistorius took to Twiiter on the anniversary of the shooting and said: 'No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva.

'The pain and sadness - especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.'

The claims come as the athlete was pictured posing with fans in Johannesburg.

Meanwhile, the family of Ms Steenkamp are said to be struggling with the trail now just weeks away.

The model's father Barry, 69, recently suffered a near fatal stroke.

He is now at home in Port Elizabeth and is said to be recovering.

Mr Steenkamp's brother Mike said his condition was a direct result of the forthcoming trial.

He told the Sunday People: 'When my brother opened a newspaper report about the upcoming trial and an out-of-court settlement, it broke him to pieces.

'That's why he had a stroke. He is not coping very well.'
