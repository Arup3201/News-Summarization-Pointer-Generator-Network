Wayne Rooney is on course to break Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goalscoring record at the club, but the Manchester United captain has struggled to find the net at the home of one their fiercest rivals.

Ahead of Sunday's crunch clash at Anfield, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal will be hoping his star striker can lead by example when United travel to Liverpool.

Rooney was on target as United swept aside Tottenham at Old Trafford on March 15 - taking his league tally to 11 this season.

However, the 29-year-old's record at Anfield is a poor one during his time at United and at boyhood club Everton. 

In 10 appearances at the ground, Rooney has only managed to score once.

That goal proved decisive though as United ran out 1-0 winners against Liverpool in January 2005.

Since then however, the stats make for unimpressive reading for Van Gaal's talisman - with the forward having failed to score in his subsequent seven appearances at Anfield.

Furthermore he has only produced two shots on target in total in those following matches and nine overall. 

Despite this, Van Gaal will be hoping Rooney can rediscover his goalscoring touch at Anfield as United battle for a place in the top four against Brendan Rodgers' side.

Defeat for United would see them drop below Liverpool into fifth with just eight Premier League games remaining.
