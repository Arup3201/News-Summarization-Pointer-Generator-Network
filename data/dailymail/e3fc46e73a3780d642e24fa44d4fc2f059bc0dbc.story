The Florida mom accused of murdering her two teen children was 'without a doubt' insane at the time of the slayings, a psychologist testified Monday.

However, prosecutors argue that 53-year-old Julie Schenecker knew what she was doing when she shot dead daughter Calyx, 16, and son Beau, 13, in January 2011 - and has simply convinced everyone into believing she's crazy.

On Monday, psychologist Dr Eldra Soloman testified for the defense as they seek to acquit Schenecker by proving she's mentally ill.

Crazy: A psychologist and psychiatrist testified in the trial of Julie Schenecker on Monday, the 53-year-old Florida mom accused of shooting dead her two teen children in 2011. They both agreed that she was insane at the time of the slayings. Pictured Monday in court

After spending 20 hours with Schenecker, and reviewing the accused's medical history, Dr Soloman diagnosed her as bi-polar with psychotic features.

'I think without a doubt that she was insane at the time of the shooting and during the week prior to the shooting,' Dr Solomon told the jury. 'Even psychopaths don't kill their own children.'

'They may be able to kill other people's children, but sane people have it wired in their DNA to protect their children,' she added.

Dr Soloman says Schenecker developed severe mental illness after being molested at the age of seven and started to think about suicide when she was just 12 years old.

Six months before the killings, Schenecker went off her medications, resulting in a 'downward spiral' which ended with Calyx and Beau's deaths.

Around that time, Schenecker started behaving bizarely, telling her therapist that she wanted to get pregnant at the age of 49 so she could immediately give the child up for adoption.

Dr Soloman believes Schenecker wanted to commit suicide, but didn't want to leave her children motherless - fearing that her daughter was becoming bi-polar and that her son would be molested just like her.

So she decided to kill herself and take 'her children with her to heaven' in order to protect them from the evils of the world.

After shooting dead her two children, Schenecker took several pills which put her to sleep - but did not prove lethal.

Schenecker's husband and the father of her children, Army Col Parker Schenecker, was deployed in the Middle East at the time and the two have since divorced.

When she woke up the next morning, Dr Soloman says Schenecker was very upset.

'She said she was very angry at herself because she failed,' Solomon said. 'She was very upset because she didn't succeed at killing herself.'

Forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Maher also testified and agrees that Schenecker was legally insane at the time of the shootings.

'My conclusion is she knew what she was doing ... but she did not know it was wrong. She believed she was protecting her children from something that was terribly horrible; she believed she was going to stay with her children and bring them with her to heaven, and it was a part of her necessary duty as a mother to do this,' Dr Maher said.

However, the prosecution has been arguing that the slayings were premeditated, and not the result of a mental breakdown.

The jury previously heard recordings of Schenecker telling detectives that her teens were mean and that she hoped they were dead just hours after their bodies were found.

'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, 'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.'

She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide.

'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.'

Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him.

'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to police Detective Gary Sandel. 'What do you think?'

'They're dead,' Det Sandel replied.

Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest.

'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said. 'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.'

Schenecker also wrote about her 'disrespectful' children in her journals but Dr Soloman said those were merely 'ramblings'.

Schenecker is facing two counts of first-degree murder and has plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty.

If acquitted by reason of insanity, the mother would be committed to a hospital until she is no longer a danger to herself or others.
