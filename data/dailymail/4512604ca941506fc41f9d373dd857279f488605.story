Never one to keep his opinions to himself, Karl Lagerfeld has landed in hot water with a pressure group for 'rounded' women.

The Chanel creative director, 80, faces legal action from women's pressure group Belle, Ronde, Sexy et je m'assume (Beautiful, Rounded, Sexy and fine with it).

He is accused of defamation after stating that: 'Nobody wants to see curvy women on the runway.'

And he didn't stop there, blaming France's public health deficit on 'fat people' and their illnesses.

Lagerfeld appeared on the French chat 
show Le Grand 8 and claimed 'the hole in social security' was all down 
to 'diseases caught by people who are too fat'. He also made his comment about curvy women on the catwalk

The Belle, Ronde, Sexy et je m'assume group has filed a complaint
 with the court in Saintes, near Bordeau, as reported in the Sunday Times.

According to French news agency AFP, 500 people have already signed a petition against Lagerfeld's views.

'These insults by celebrities must stop,' said Betty Aubri√®re of Belle, Ronde.

'We're
 sick of it. There are a lot of young girls who don't feel comfortable 
in their skin and for them to hear comments like that is terrible for 
them.'

The defamation complaint accuses 
Chanel's creative director of displaying a 'discriminatory' attitude 
towards those with fuller figures. If found guilty, Lagerfeld could be 
fined.

That might not make much difference to a man known as the Kaiser, but it may give some satisfaction to those he has insulted.

Ever since slamming Adele for being 'a little too fat', Lagerfeld has hardly hidden his opinions on women and weight. Last year, the German-born designer, based in France, said that she has a pretty face and a divine voice, despite being 'too fat'.

Adele said: 'I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that.'
