Portugal coach Fernando Santos has started his makeover of the national team by naming five new players, including Southampton captain Jose Fonte in his first squad selection.

Santos took over from Paulo Bento last month and is trying to turn around Portugal's recent dip in form, which included a 1-0 loss to Albania in its opening European Championship qualifier.

Santos turned to talented youngsters as he picked defenders Fonte, Cedric and Ivo Pinto, and midfielders Adrien Silva and Joao Mario, who have never played for Portugal.

Saints skipper Fonte was included on a preliminary 40-man list earlier this week and has now made the final cut.

He will link up with his international teammates next week, following Sunday's trip to Tottenham.

Portugal travel to France, who have Saints midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in their squad, on Saturday, October 11, before visiting Denmark on Tuesday, October 14, for a crucial fixture.
