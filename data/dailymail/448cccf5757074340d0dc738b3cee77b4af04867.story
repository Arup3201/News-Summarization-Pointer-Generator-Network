A hospital patient was refused toast as she recovered on a ward after being told by nurses it was a fire risk.

Joan Wigmore, 64, asked for a slice of toast for breakfast as she recovered from complications following an operation at Barnet Hospital, north London.

But she was left stunned when nurses on the Quince Ward claimed the option of toast was too dangerous and instead offered her a choice of either cereal or bread and jam.

Mrs Wigmore, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it.

‘When I am not feeling well toast is about all I can face for breakfast - but they told me it was a fire risk.

‘I wasn’t insisting they have a toaster in the ward - I just don’t see why they couldn’t have brought it to me from the kitchen.’

A spokeswoman for the Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust, which runs Barnet Hospital, said toasters had been banned on wards because they kept triggering smoke alarms.

She said: ‘It’s not possible to get toast to patients before it goes cold because many wards are too far from the kitchen.

‘Instead, we offer patients cereal or bread with butter and jam, as well as tea or coffee for breakfast.

The Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust, which runs Barnet Hospital, apologised for the incident and said toasters had been banned on wards because they kept triggering smoke alarms (file picture)

‘However, when patients make particular requests we always try to be accommodating.

‘We would like to apologise to Mrs Wigmore because in this instance a member of staff should have taken her toast from the restaurant.’

Mrs Wigmore, who is now recovering at home, added: ‘They should give me a year’s supply of toast now instead - delivered straight to my front door.’
