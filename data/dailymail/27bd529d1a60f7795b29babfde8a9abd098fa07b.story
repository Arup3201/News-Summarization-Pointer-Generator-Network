It was certainly a result that raised a few eyebrows. Arsenal, often so timid on the road against the big teams, producing a masterclass to whack a great big dent in Manchester City's title hopes.

In the cold post-mortem of Sunday's game, after the thrill of Santi Cazorla's penalty and Olivier Giroud's header, it was found that the Gunners had just 35.33 per cent of possession.

It means they saw less of the ball on Sunday than in any of their Premier League matches since 2003 and yet still came away with a very impressive victory.

But while Arsene Wenger's team are renowned for adopting a passing game, craving the ball at all times and working it around to try and force an opportunity, they can also win without it - especially on the road.

Indeed, a study of their possession stats from every away match since 2003 shows that they won seven of the eight matches in which they had a smaller share of the ball.

Sunday's match at the Etihad Stadium tops the list but there are plenty of other examples.

In November 2008, Arsenal saw just 40.22 per cent of the ball at Stamford Bridge, and yet still beat Chelsea 2-1 thanks to a double from Robin van Persie.

STATS COURTESY OF OPTA 

The Gunners won at Tottenham thanks to Rosicky's goal back in March after seeing 40 per cent of the ball

Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring at Anfield earlier this season. Arsenal had just 36.48 per cent of the ball

And in March last year, they defeated Tottenham at White Hart Lane thanks to Tomas Rosicky's winner having enjoyed a mere 40.38 per cent of possession.

Back in December, they earned a 2-2 draw at Liverpool despite only having 36.48 per cent of the ball.

Matches against their fellow top-four candidates aside, Arsenal have also shown a capability to grind out results when starved of possession at Swansea, Blackburn and West Ham in the last few years.

It shows that possession of the ball is not the be-all and end-all in any match.

Curiously though, while Arsenal can grind out results with just 35 or 40 per cent possession on their travels, it's a different story at the Emirates.

Lukas Podolski celebrates with Jack Wilshere after scoring in Arsenal's 7-3 win over Newcastle in December 2012. In a bizarre game, the Gunners had just 44.1 per cent of possession but scored seven goals.

Most sides visiting north London find themselves under the cosh but occasionally some come and dominate.

Manchester City, visiting in January 2013, won 2-0 after restricting Arsenal to just 39.72 per cent of the ball.

But conversely, Arsenal beat Tottenham 1-0 in September 2013, thanks to Olivier Giroud's winner, after seeing a mere 43.14 per cent of possession.

And, perhaps the most bizarre of all, Arsenal's 7-3 rout of Newcastle United in December 2012 came after they enjoyed just 44.1 per cent of the ball.
