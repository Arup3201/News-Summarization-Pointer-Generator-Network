Mortgage approvals have dropped by a fifth as the winter chill intensifies in Britain’s housing market.

Figures from the British Bankers’ Association reveal tougher rules on lending have put the brakes on home loans.

The number of mortgages approved on house purchases dropped to 36,717 in November – down for the fifth straight month and a 20 per cent slump on the same period last year.

Levels are now at their lowest since April last year, when the housing market was just beginning to heat up.

Richard Woolhouse, the BBA’s chief economist, said: ‘Today’s figures show quite a sharp chill to the housing market in recent months – with house purchase approvals during November 20 per cent lower than a year before.’

Experts say the slowdown in the housing market has been driven by tougher affordability checks introduced in April as part of the Mortgage Market Review – designed to stop households overstretching themselves.

In some cases applicants in their late thirties and forties are being refused mortgages because lenders feared they may be ‘too old’ to repay their loans into old age.

In further evidence that the housing market is cooling, figures released this week indicated that property prices are falling all over Britain as the sector ends the year with a whimper.

Average values fell in nearly a third of UK postcodes in the three months to November, according to property website Hometrack. In spring last year there were falls in fewer than one in five areas.

There are also growing concerns that houses have become too expensive in areas such as London and the South East.

A major shake-up of the Isa market has driven a dramatic increase in the amount of cash being tucked away in the tax free savings accounts.

Savers ploughed £12billion into schemes in the year to November – up from £8.7billion on the same period last year, according to figures released yesterday by the British Bankers’ Association.

Experts have attributed the 38 per cent surge on the launch of the new ‘super Isa’ in July – in which the annual cash allowance was raised from £5,670 to £15,0000.

However, analysts last night said savers are still getting a poor deal, with interest rates at ‘all time lows’. The Bank of England says the average easy access cash Isa, where there are no restrictions on withdrawals, has a rate of just 0.82 per cent – below the current 1 per cent rate of inflation. A saver would earn just £123 in a year on an investment of the full £15,000.

Even the best high street deals – by National Savings and Investments and the Post Office, offer rates of just 1.5 per cent. Santander’s Easy Isa and Halifax Variable Rate Isa saver have annual interest of just 0.1 per cent.

Charlotte Nelson, of comparison website Moneyfacts, said initial hopes that reforms would herald better deals for savers have not transpired.

She added: ‘Whilst it is great news that more savers are investing into Isas since the increase in allowance to £15,000, the fact remains that rates have slumped to all time lows.’

She said savers were paying a high price for government-backed home loan schemes and record low interest base rates.

Despite the recent slowdown, overall house prices in Britain are still up on the same period last year. Office for National Statistics figures last week showed the average property is now worth £271,000 – up 10.4 per cent year on year.

David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London & Country, said: ‘The availability of finance had been limited by the Mortgage Market Review. There has also been a lot of talk about a housing bubble – which may have dented confidence.’

Bank of England governor Mark Carney is among those who believe the Chancellor’s radical reforms of stamp duty – unveiled in the Autumn Statement earlier this month – could inject new life into the housing market.

The overhaul equates to a tax cut for 98 per cent of homebuyers, with only those buying properties worth more than £937,500 paying more.

Mr Woolhouse added: ‘It will be interesting to see what impact the stamp duty changes the Chancellor unveiled in his Autumn Statement will have early in the New Year. They could prove a modest stocking filler for homebuyers and estate agents.’

Tougher rules on lending under the Mortgage Market Review were introduced in April to force lenders to prove their customers will be able to afford to pay off loans.

Fearful of breaking the rules, banks are turning down older applicants who are likely to be making repayments in retirement when incomes are lower.

A report last month warned that borrowers in their 40s are being shut out as the average age of a first-time buyer rises to 36.
