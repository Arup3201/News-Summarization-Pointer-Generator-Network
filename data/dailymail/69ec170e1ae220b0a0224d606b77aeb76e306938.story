Each December, when the draw for the second round of the Champions League takes place at UEFA headquarters on the banks of Lake Geneva, the ties always look so appealing for the English sides.

There are a few ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ as UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino presides over the draw, but generally we are cocksure about the English teams chances of reaching the quarter-finals.

When Manchester City draw Barcelona again, we convince ourselves that the Catalans are not the team who redefined the game when they won the Champions League in 2006, 2009 and again in 2011 at Wembley.

Luis Suarez scored a terrific double to condemn Manchester City to defeat at the Etihad on Tuesday

Lionel Messi was in top form despite missing a penalty as Barca produced a masterclass performance

On Tuesday night, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez wiped the floor with City at the Etihad and will wonder how on earth they only won that first leg won 2-1.

So, 24 hours later we moved on to the Emirates, brainwashed into believing that Monaco were the weakest team left in the competition because they scored only one goal in the group stages.

They kept five clean sheets in six group games, too, but again there was conviction in the air when Arsene Wenger sent out a team with five hugely influential forwards in his side.

Monaco’s response was to rely on a classic European model of counter-attacking football, scoring three times to surely put this tie beyond the reach of Arsenal in the Stade Louis II on March 17.

Only the hippest hipster will pretend he knew too much about the way Monaco would approach this game before they trained at the Emirates on Tuesday night. The rest of us were simply guessing.

So was Arsene Wenger and as tough as this may sound on a guy who has taken team to the 2006 Champions League final against Barcelona, he was exposed tactically. It was brutal, and ruthless.

For all his other qualities, too numerous to mention here, plotting the downfall of the an opponent at the highest level is an area of the game has never been the Arsenal manager’s forte and it is not use pretending otherwise. In Europe, a sharp tactical mind, is gold.

Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Jose Mourinho and the three-time European Cup winner Bob Paisley are among the great tacticians at this level. Wenger does not belong in that category.

Arsenal approached this first leg like they would a home game against Newcastle or Stoke in the Barclays Premier League, expecting to wallop them and send the fans home happy.

What a mistake to make as goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Dimitar Berbatov and the substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco deep into injury time piled on the misery.

This is European football, where the sharpest and most astute tactical minds plot and plan the two legs weeks in advance. For all his faults Mourinho approaches these ties like a battleship commander, placing himself in every single scenario ahead of these mammoth European ties. It is the only way.

Jose Mourinho (centre) has become a tactical mastermind in the Champions League and his results say that

It is one of the reasons why the Chelsea manager, who won the European Cup with Porto in 2004 and again with Inter Milan in 2010, has been so successful in this elite environment.

Predictably, wearily, it feels like it is time for another radical rethink of the English game after the gung-ho approach of City and Arsenal this week. We are going soft here, fellas, and going out.

For City to progress they will have to score a minimum of two goals in Nou Camp on March 18. Arsenal will need at least three.

Sure, it is not over yet, and there will be many who point to the success of the English teams in this competition over the past few seasons.

Manuel Pellegrini (right) has been critcised by some fans for getting his tactics and team selection wrong

Manchester United beat Chelsea in Moscow (2008), they lost badly in the final to Barcelona (2009 and 2011) before Roman Abramovich at last got his hands on the European Cup in the Allianz Arena in 2012.

There is a sense that the English game got a bit too giddy, but then how does that explain Mourinho’s five successive semi-finals, from 2010 to 2014 with Inter (when they won it), Real Madrid and Chelsea? The reason is because he plans for every eventuality, reasoning that the more information he can pass on his players the better the chance they have of getting through.

As Wenger has been reminded yet again, sending 11 men out with a ball just won’t wash at this level.
