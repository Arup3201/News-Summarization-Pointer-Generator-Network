Victor Piturca has resigned as Romania coach in order to take charge at Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad.

Piturca's decision comes after Romania's 2-0 win over Finland on Tuesday moved them up to second place in Group F of the Euro 2016 qualifiers ahead of next month's meeting with group leaders Northern Ireland.

'The Romanian Football Federation and Victor Piturca have cancelled today, October 16 2014, by mutual consent, the contract for the post of coach of the Romanian national team and the contracts of the other members of coaching staff,' a statement on the Romanian Football Federation (FRF) website said.

The FRF has called a press conference for Monday to discuss their next step with the national team.

Al Ittihad were recently linked with a move for Neil Lennon prior to him taking over at Bolton, while former Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis also turned down the post.

Posting a picture of Piturca holding a scarf alongside club officials on their official Twitter account, a tweet said: 'Victor Piturca. The current manager of #Ittihad'

Piturca, 58, had been in his third spell in charge of Romania, taking over in 2011 after previously guiding the national team to the European Championships in 2000 and 2008.

Al Ittihad are second in the Saudi Arabian Pro League on goal difference, having won all six matches so far, but they have been seeking a permanent replacement for Khalid Al Koroni since August.

Tony Pulis earlier rejected the chance to take charge of the Saudi Arabian outfit
