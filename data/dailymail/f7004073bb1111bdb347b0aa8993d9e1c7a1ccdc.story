A Wisconsin Christian university is dropping the word 'Crusaders' from its sports teams, saying the word doesn't fit with a 'more global society.'

The Maranatha Baptist University in Watertown and its sports teams have used the name since the college's founding in 1968.

The decision coincides with a recent name change, from Maranatha Baptist Bible College to Maranatha Baptist University.

Updating: The Maranatha Baptist University is dropping the name 'Crusaders' for its sports teams and mascot, but says it has not received any complaints about the name

The university's executive vice president stresses that the school has received no complaints about the name Crusaders.

'The heartbeat behind this was not political correctness, but expanded opportunities for our students,' Matt Davis told Fox News.

Davis says the change had long been in discussion among the university's Board of Trustees, who decided that 2014 was the appropriate time.

Tradition: The college has used the name Crusaders for nearly 50 years

The word Crusades - defined by 
Merriam-Webster as 'any of the military expeditions undertaken by 
Christian powers in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries to win the Holy 
Land from the Muslims' - to some speaks of heroics, but for others - 
namely Muslims - it speaks of bloody murder.

'Times
 change and we understand that context changes,' Davis told Fox News. 
'Our world has changed since 9/11 and we’ve become a more global society
 with the Internet.'

Ibrahim Hooper, communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Mail Online that he welcomes the 'Crusaders' change, but said CAIR finds team names or mascots that incorporate race or ethnicity more problematic, particularly those pertaining to Native Americans.

Changes: The school has recently changed its name from Maranatha Baptist Bible College to Maranatha Baptist University

'Our main
concern has been with stereotypical and racist team mascots or school
nicknames,' he said, adding that he 'welcomes the spirit of change.'

The university is now fielding suggestions from its students, stakeholders and alumni for a new name and mascot for its teams.

'We’re having a blast with the process,' said Davis. 'It’s a fun process, but it’s also a serious process.'

The new name will be revealed in the spring.

The university's mission is to provide a 'Christ-centered, biblically based liberal arts education... providing each student with a platform to fulfill God’s plan for his or her life.'
