It is the destination of choice for the rich and famous, but jet setters headed for St Bart's by plane must navigate a steep descent over a busy road as they come into land.

These photographs show just how perilous the journey to the luxury holiday isle can be, with the aircraft seemingly just a few feet from a hill top roundabout before it lands.

The small silver plane also appears to narrowly miss a motorbike, before reaching the tiny runway on the Caribbean island.

Tight spot: The aircraft must navigate a steep descent over a road before landing

The airstrip at Gustaf III airport is so small that pilots are required to have special training just to be able to land there.

And on a windy day the journey in can be even scarier, while planes departing the airport almost skim the heads of sunbathers making the most of the good weather.

The airport, situated in the village of St John, has been rated the world's third most dangerous by History Channel programme Most Extreme Airports, although it has also topped polls for the best approach.

St Bart's, or St Barthelemy, has long been the destination of choice for many wealthy celebrities, including recent visitors Princess Beatrice, Olivia Palermo and George Lucas, especially during the winter months.

However, stars such as Simon Cowell and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich tend to avoid the airport and arrive by yacht.
