Prosecutors have called for a life sentence for the man who bashed a 10-month-old baby to death during a burglary at a home in Bendigo on June 15, 2012.

The Supreme Court was told 21-year-old Harley Hicks, of North Bendigo, hit Zayden Veal-Whitting more than 30 times in the face and head with a baton made of copper wire wrapped in tape.

Prosecutor Michelle Williams said there was 'almost has no explanation' for the murder.

'We consider what he did was an extreme, extreme way to respond to any thought of self-preservation, to react in such a violent way,' she told the Victorian Supreme Court in Bendigo on Monday.

Zayden's mother Casey Veal, who frantically tried to revive her baby after finding him in blood-stained sheets in his cot, said she and her older son Xavier 'both died that day'.

'I may stand before you alive and breathing but I'm but a shadow of my former self,' she wrote in a victim impact statement read to the court.

'This also has denied Xavier the mother he once knew.

'Xavier lost not only his brother but his true mother.'

Ms Williams told Justice Stephen Kaye the prosecution wanted a life sentence with a non-parole period.

'I will repeat that it is an evil killing without any rational explanation, so we will maintain our submission for a life sentence, however we say that it is appropriate for your honour to apply a minimum sentence.'

She said a minimum term is consistent with sentences involving the murder of children including that of Robert Farquharson, who drowned his three sons in a car on Father's Day in 2005.

Defence barrister David Gallowes agreed with the gravity of Hicks' crime but said his client's consumption of alcohol, marijuana and ice before it might have contributed to its ferocity.

'There is some prospect of rehabilitation even if the prognosis is poor,' Mr Gallowes said.

Ms Williams said Hicks had an extensive criminal record, with nine court appearances before his murder trial dating back to 2007 for crimes including wilful damage, thefts and burglaries.

She said Hicks breached almost all of the orders, including good behaviour bonds and community corrections orders, given to him.

Mr Gallowes said Hicks' parents separated when he was eight and neither offered an appropriate home environment.

The court also heard that Hicks drifted into drug and alcohol abuse and was sexually abused as a teenager.

A psychological exam found Hicks had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a conduct disorder and an anti-social personality disorder.

MailOnline reported details of the murder after Hicks was found guilty of murder, aggravated burglary and two counts of theft amid a robbery spree in the Bendigo suburb of Long Gully on June 15, 2012.

Hicks is awaiting a sentencing date.
