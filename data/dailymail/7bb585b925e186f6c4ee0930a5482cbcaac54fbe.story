Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have failed in attempts to convince a federal judge to suspend jury selection because of last week's attacks in France. 

Lawyers representing 21-year-old Tsarnaev had argued on Tuesday that the bloody events in Paris that left 17 dead had once again placed the 2013 marathon bombings 'at the center of a grim global drama.'

According to the lawyers, a delay would have allowed some time 'for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events - and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case - to diminish.'

Appeal: Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in courtroom sketch from January 5) have failed in attempts to convince a judge  to suspend jury selection because of last week's attacks in France

Comparison: The defense had argued that the bloody events in Paris had once again placed the 2013 marathon bombings that killed three and wounded 260 'at the center of a grim global drama'

Jury selection for the trial began last week when some 1,350 candidates filled out questionnaires at U.S. District Court in Boston and will continue on Thursday when the first group of 20 jurors is brought in for follow-up questioning, a process known by the Latin phrase 'voir dire.'

'My detailed review of the juror questionnaires in preparation for voir dire has so far confirmed, rather than undermined, my judgment that a fair and impartial jury can and will be chosen to determine the issues in this case,' U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said in a electronic court filing on Wednesday.  

Lawyers for Tsarnaev had said that potential jurors had been instructed to avoid media reports about their client's case, but were exposed to reports about the massacre in France. 

'Almost immediately after the attacks, the press, politicians, and commentators drew parallels between the French attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing,' the lawyers wrote.

In the marathon case, authorities say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planned and carried out the attack as retaliation for U.S. wars in Muslim countries. 

Three people were killed and more than 260 were wounded when twin bombs exploded at the finish line on April 15, 2013.

Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police days after the bombings. Dzhokhar, 21, could face the death penalty if convicted.

In the Paris attacks, which began January 7 on the third day of jury selection in Tsarnaev's trial, two gunmen, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, burst into the Paris offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. 

A total of 17 people were shot dead in a three-day terrorist killing spree, including four hostages inside a kosher deli. The Kouachi brothers and a third gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, were killed by police in two raids. 

More than 1,350 prospective jurors in the Boston bombing trial were called in to federal court in Boston last week to fill out lengthy juror questionnaires. The judge will begin questioning individual jurors Thursday.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have asked repeatedly to delay the trial and to move it outside Massachusetts, where almost everyone seems to know someone connected to the marathon or personally affected by the 2013 bombings. 

Federal Judge George O'Toole Jr. has rejected the defense requests.

Last week, officials in Boston drastically stepped up security measures in light of the attakc sin France.

White SUVs from Homeland Security lineed up bumper-to-bumper in front of Boston's federal courthouse Friday while others periodically circled the block.

Boston police officers patroled the perimeter on foot, and a dark special operations van was stationed near the entrance.

In the harbor nearby, armed US Coast Guard boats plied the waters, and inside the court building officers with dogs roamed the hallways.

Boston police spokesman Michael McCarthy said his department was not aware of any credible threats.

Boston's federal courthouse is used to heightened security, most recently in 2013, when notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger was tried, convicted and sentenced there.

Law enforcement officials will be keeping a watchful eye on the demonstrators and onlookers the proceedings periodically have drawn, as well as the hundreds of prospective jurors who have been filing in and out of the courthouse complex.

They'll likely also be keeping tabs on social media, where Tsarnaev's supporters and bombing conspiracy theorists have been active.

The heightened awareness extends to nearby businesses along the rapidly developing waterfront.
