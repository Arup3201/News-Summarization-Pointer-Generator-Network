A man, who became famous on the Internet as Kai 'the Hatchet-Wielding Hitchhiker', pleaded not guilty on Monday to a murder charge via a lawyer who spoke on his behalf.

Caleb McGillivary, 24, is accused of killing 73-year-old lawyer Joseph Galfy, whose body was found on May 13 in his Clark, New Jersey home.

During an appearance on Monday in a Union County jail courtroom, McGillivary questioned Judge Brenda Coppola Cuba at times about his plea and bail. He wore an oatmeal-colored T-shirt and stood in a part of the courtroom enclosed by thick glass.

McGillivary said a private attorney is attempting to contact him but claims he was not allowed to use a phone in jail.

The judge told McGillivary he would be allowed to make a phone call.

Lorraine Stanley, the public defender representing McGillivary, said friends have been working to get defense attorney Miles Feinstein involved in McGillivary's case.

A woman who answered the phone at Mr Feinstein's office said he was in court.

McGillivary took a star turn in February after intervening in an attack on a Fresno, California utility worker.

He described himself as 'home free' instead of homeless and said he's from West Virginia. He is actually Canadian.

McGillivary at times appeared confused about the charges against him and the way the American legal process works.

He asked the judge to 'elaborate' on the charges, and asked if he would be able to 'postpone the plea' if he was represented by a private lawyer.

Stanley told McGillivary she was pleading not guilty on his behalf to 'get the ball rolling'. The case will now go before a grand jury.

McGilivary was told at the end of the proceeding he is being held on $3 million bail.

'Ok, fine. Cool,' he said.

Authorities say McGillivary and Galfy met in New York City. McGillvary stayed at Galfy's home. He was arrested in Philadelphia days later.

Kai became an Internet celebrity after
he thwarted a deadly attack on a California woman with the help of his 
hatchet in February. 

But 
despite appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and an immediate fan base, his hero 
status quickly disintegrated after he was accused of murdering Joseph 
Galfy at his home after they met in Times Square.

Galfy's body was found two days later. Their earlier encounter was caught on surveillance video.

The 73-year-old was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide indicated the encounter was sexual in nature.

On his Facebook page, McGillvary's last post before he was arrested said: 'What would you do? if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted.'

One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.'

Photos and a YouTube video from early March show the 24-year-old vagrant getting an elaborate tattoo on his right cheek which helped police apprehend him after a Starbucks barrista recognized it and told police.
