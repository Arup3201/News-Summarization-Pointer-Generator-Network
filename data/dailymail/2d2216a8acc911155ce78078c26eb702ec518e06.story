Tennis star Serena Williams was today forced to withdraw from China's Wuhan Open after falling ill with a virus during her second-round match.

The 32-year-old American, currently ranked world number one, was beating French opponent Alize Cornet 6-5 in the first set when she suddenly asked for treatment beside the court.

She had her temperature and blood pressure taken by a doctor, before she officially withdrew and was helped from the court by a trainer. She was reportedly later taken to hospital as a precaution.

It comes just two months after Williams was forced to retired from a doubles match with her sister Venus after a mystery illness left her completely disoriented and unable to serve or throw the ball.

Today, the player, who appeared fatigued throughout the match, apologized to fans for withdrawing from the $2.4million hard court competition, according to Sports Illustrated. 

In a statement, she said: 'I felt dizzy and nauseous in the first set and unfortunately could not continue.

'The tournament organizers have done an amazing job preparing the facilities for this year's event and I really hope to come back to the Wuhan Open in 2015.'

The match, which was held at the Optics Valley International Tennis Center in Wuhan, was the first Williams had played since winning her 18th grand slam title in the U.S. Open. 

It is also the third she has dropped to 24-year-old Cornet so far this year, with the Frenchwoman previously having triumphed at Dubai in February and in the third round at Wimbledon. 

The latest result means Cornet is the first player since Justine Henin in 2007 to beat Williams three times in year, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) said.

Another elimination: Williams's withdrawal followed the elimination of the tournament's No. 2-ranked Simona Halep of Romania, who was ousted by Spain's Garbine Muguruza (pictured following her victory) 2-6, 6-2, 6-3

Williams's withdrawal followed the elimination of the tournament's No. 2-ranked Simona Halep of Romania, who was ousted by Spain's Garbine Muguruza 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.

Muguruza, who beat Williams in the second round at the last French Open, dropped the first set in 35 minutes but rallied to win the first four games of the second set and the last four  of the third. 

Meanwhile, Chinese player Li Na dropped out of the competition last week. The two-time major winner called it quits on her professional career, citing knee injuries.

Previous illness: Williams's illness on July 1 saw her struggle to throw, hit and serve a ball while competing in a Wimbledon doubles match with her sister Venus. The star was later seen crying beside the court (above)

Williams's illness on July 1 saw her struggle to throw, hit and serve a ball while competing in a Wimbledon doubles match against Germany's Kristina Barrois and Switzerland's Stefanie Voegle. 

She was later pictured crying at the side of the court as a medic treated her.

Earlier this month, the star missed all of her morning TV appearances after reportedly partying until the early hours of the morning with Danish player Caroline Wozniacki following her US Open win.

Williams was due to appear on NBC's 'Today', ABC's 'Good Morning America' and 'Live With Kelly and Michael' with her trophy, but canceled because she was apparently too tired from her antics.

During the night out, she partied with Wozniacki at Tao and VIP Room, where their group of more than 25 ordered Champagne and vodka and danced until 3am, according to the New York Post.

Her late nights, along with her recent disappointing doubles performances, have reportedly irritated her older sister, who is known for her more laid-back lifestyle.
