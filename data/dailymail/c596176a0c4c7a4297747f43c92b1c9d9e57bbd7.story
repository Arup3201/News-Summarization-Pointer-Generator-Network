A terminally ill cancer patient has crossed off the last item on his bucket list - jumping out of a plane.

After more than two years of harrowing treatment and surgeries, Brian Nagle, 51, was told doctors could do nothing for more for him.

So, after walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding, holding his first grandchild and riding on a motorcycle, he plunged to earth from 14,000 feet in a tandem skydive with a trained instructor.

The daredevil experience was actually delayed, once by surgery and a second time when doctors said a rough landing could result in bleeding due to blood thinners he was taking for his treatment.

However, those concerns were set aside after he entered hospice.

'They have run out of options for me,' the Blaine, Minnesota, man told USA Today.

Nagle was 49 when he went to his doctor complaining of stomach pains, but he was misdiagnosed with an ulcer.

Two months later, he was told that what he in fact had colon cancer and the cancer had spread. Now 51, his body is riddled and his liver is started to fail.

But Nagel said he's come to terms with his condition.

Granddaughter: He got to meet his first grandchild

'I'm ready. I think I'm more ready than my kids and my wife and my family,' he told USA Today.

His daughter, Katie Popp, told the newspaper that he has a matter of weeks to live.

'That was hard to hear,' she said.

So the family set off to the Baldwin location of Skydive Twin Cities while he still could. 

He had planned to skydive with both his daughters, Katie and Nicole Schuman.

However,
 word spread on Facebook and soon two dozen friends and relatives signed
 up to the plunge too. A crowd of supporters came to watch and cheer him
 on.

Bike: And also ride a motorcycle, which is always something he's wanted to do

'You don't realize it until something like this happens how many people are out there, ready to just help you fight,' Nagle told the newspaper.

When the time came, Nagle stepped out the plane's door and grinned as he free-fell at 120 miles an hour to the ground surrounded by loved ones.

He said he's also ready for his next, and final trip.

'I believe in heaven, I believe there is a place I'm going to go that's going to be a better place and I'm going to see people that have passed before me,' he told USA Today after his jump.
