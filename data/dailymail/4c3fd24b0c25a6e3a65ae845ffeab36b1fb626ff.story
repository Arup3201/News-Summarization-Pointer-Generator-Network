A possessive boyfriend who beat his petite girlfriend to death while shouting 'log on, log on' after becoming obsessed with the idea that she was having an affair on Facebook has been jailed for life.

Kane Boyce, 34, brutally murdered Paula Newman, 20, in New Addington, south London, after she refused to hand over a password to one of her social media accounts.

He stamped on her head and nearby residents heard piercing screams as he attacked her and shouted: 'If you don't log on, we'll see what happens.'

Following the brutal attack, which caused Miss Newman to suffer a major haemorrhage, Boyce drove her to a friend's house where he showered her as she slipped in and out of consciousness.

He failed to call an ambulance until the following morning and she was taken to hospital where she died from her injuries.

Boyce, an electrician from Erith, southeast London, has now been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years before parole.

The jury was told that while Boyce had the ability to charm women, he had a history of being manipulative, controlling and extremely violent to his partners.

The Old Bailey heard how he admitted manslaughter in relation to Ms Newman's death but was found guilty of murder following a trial by jury.

Sentencing Boyce, Judge Paul Worsley QC said he was 'controlling, obsessive and violent' towards women.

He said: 'The attack was a sustained and brutal assault using fists and feet and your superior force.

'I regard you as a man who has demonstrated that you are a danger to young women who form relationships with you.

'Paula was a vulnerable woman. Besotted by you, she was only 20 and you were 13 years her senior, almost a foot taller and you weighed some seven stone more than she did.

'You had a history of violence and controlling behaviour towards her.

'You have a record of cowardly attacks towards other women going back 15 years.'

Boyce, wearing a pink shirt and grey blazer, stared straight ahead impassively as he was sentenced.

The court heard how he flew into a fit of rage on November 12, 2013, when Miss Newman stopped him from reading her online messages and refused to hand over her Facebook password.

The Old Bailey heard how Boyce was 'obsessed' with looking at Miss Newman's Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him

He was 'obsessed' with looking at her Facebook account because he suspected she was cheating on him, the Old Bailey heard.

He claimed they both accessed each other's Facebook accounts to 'give each other lives' on the Candy Crush mobile phone game.

'You get four lives an hour or something,' he said. 'I went on her phone to send myself a life so I could carry on playing.'

On the evening of the murder, he attacked Ms Newman in his car and then followed her as she tried to escape to a nearby field in the New Addington area of south London.

Neighbours heard 'piercing female screams' as he pushed her to the ground, hit her and stamped on her face, causing a major haemorrhage.

He then bundled his girlfriend back into his car and drove her to a friend's house where he showered her and left her lying naked on the bed.

At 6am the next morning, he drove to a stretch of road and collected Miss Newman's shoe and body warmer from beside a fence.

When he returned home, paramedics were finally called, but Miss Newman  could not be saved.

Following her death, Boyce lied about the attack and claimed she had suffered a fit. He also destroyed any evidence linking him to the crime.

Prosecutor Gillian Etherton, QC, said: 'This defendant is a man who is jealous, obsessive, controlling, and violent.

'The defendant, in a violent rage, beat and it would appear kicked or stamped on Paula's head causing her severe and irreparable brain injury which brought about her death.'

The court heard how Miss Newman had been planning to leave Boyce in the weeks before her death.

'It appears that at the beginning of their relationship, the defendant treated Paula well and gave her gifts, but within a few months this changed', she said.

'The relationship was up and down to say the very least.

'By the end of the summer, Paula was confiding in those close to her that they were serious problems in the relationship, they were arguing, she told those close to her that the defendant was controlling, abusive and possessive and she was unhappy.'

Stefani Taylor, a friend of Miss Newman, told police: 'He had complete control of her and I have never seen her like that before.

'I pleaded with her to leave him but she would always say she loved him.'

Miss Newman, who was five foot three inches tall and weighed under nine stone, started dating Boyce just seven months before he killed her and they first shared a house in Beckenham, London.

The court heard how she told a friend four days before her death that she wanted to move out, and asked for help removing her possessions to avoid Boyce noticing until she had actually left.

'Paula also confided in her niece Nicola Newman that the defendant wanted her to stay in the house all the time - she felt like a prisoner', Ms Etherton said.

Ms Etherton added that the day before her death, Boyce was heard complaining that Miss Newman would not let him into her Facebook account.

'In the weeks prior to Paula's death, and indeed at the time of her death, this defendant became obsessed with getting access to Paula's Facebook accounts', she said.

Boyce told a friend: 'I've asked her for this Facebook account and she won't give it over to me for love nor money.'

He also posted online: 'I knew she was f****** cheating on me, lying cheating slag', the court heard.

In sentencing Boyce, Judge Worsley said Miss Newman 'had her life ahead of her'.

He told the court: 'She was a much-loved member of her family.

'You ended that life when you lost your temper with her because you disapproved or disagreed with her Facebook friends.

'You were controlling abusive and violent.

'You attacked her on the edge of a housing estate when she got out of the car to escape your violence. You took her to the ground and you beat her and kicked her and she sustained a subdural haemorrhage.

'There is evidence of a stamp and a mark of an upper trainer could have caused the mark to her face.

'You failed to call an ambulance because you feared that they would recognise the bruising on her face chest and arms as signs of violence. You tried to conceal what had happened.'

The judge described Boyce's explanation in court as 'another tissue of lies' and added: 'You have lied throughout in an attempt to save your skin.'

Boyce shook his head as he was led down to the cells.

In a victim impact statement, Miss Newman's brother Gary Newman said her four brothers were wracked by guilt that they could not protect their younger sister.

He said: 'Losing Paula has left my family feeling sad, shocked, cheated and devastated.

'The incident has totally destabilised my family and it is a day to day struggle for each member of our family.

'We are all devastated and confused and want to know the truth about what happened to our sister.'

Mr Newman said Miss Newman was 'the baby of the family' and described her as 'an amazing person.'

He added: 'Paula was a lovely beautiful girl who we saw growing into a beautiful young woman.

'We were just starting to feel that Paula was standing on her own two feet.

'When the family gets together it doesn't feel the same anymore because Paula isn't there.

'She should have lived a long, healthy, happy life. She had a kind, carrying nature and was always there for you.

'It hurts to think that all we have are memories of her, and won't get the chance to hold her and hug her again.'

'We know that nothing will ever bring her back but the family are putting their faith in the judicial system and can only hope that Kane Boyce gets his just rewards.'
