Letters show how 'shaky' Hitler's hold on power was at times and how 
unpopular the Second World War became among the German masses

Letters written by ordinary Germans to Adolf Hitler during the dark days of Nazi Germany have been discovered in a Russian archive.

The fascinating correspondence, which will surprise many with their critical tone, begins in 1924 and goes right through to the Fuhrer’s last days as he cowered in a Berlin bunker in 1945.

The documents, which were found in a Russian archive, have now been translated into English and reveal a side of the Nazis that is rarely considered.

Support: Gustav Jaindl of Vienna wrote this letter to Hitler thanking him for the integration of Austria into the greater German Reich.  His letter is among those recently found in a Russian archive and which are now published in a new book

They show how the popularity of Hitler's National Socialists party was carefully managed as support grew among the German population - and beyond.

But, more surprisingly, the letters 
also show how 'shaky' Hitler’s hold on power was at times and how 
unpopular the Second World War became among the masses.

His office even received, and replied to, letters from Jews complaining about his party's increasingly anti-Semitic stance.

Chillingly, the British editor of a 
book publishing the correspondence, Letter To Hitler, claims the 
collection shows how a similarly totalitarian regime could emerge today.

Dr Victoria Harris said: 'Some letters from people who idolise
 him are totally fawning, but you get the impression from the others 
that he could easily lose his approval.

'The biggest lesson I learned was how shaky his popularity was and how the regime had to work hard to maintain popularity.

'What is chilling is that you can see how he built his support and how you could see it happening elsewhere.'

The Nazis carefully filed all the letters that their leader received, copied the replies and filed those as well.

The letters grew in number through 
the 1930s as the Nazi party became more powerful, and include thousands 
wishing Hitler a happy birthday.

The correspondence includes letters 
from Jews unhappy with his policies, and from others pointing out to 
Hitler what he ought to be doing.

From Mrs von Ponief in 1930

As early as 1925 the direction of the National Socialist party was being questioned, especially its lack of religious revival.

Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess responded
 to one such enquiry by stating that religious revival was not among the
 goals of the Nazi Party.

Hess replied to another correspondent in 1925 who asked whether Hitler drank.

The reply was: 'Mr Hitler does not 
drink alcohol, except perhaps a few drops on very exceptional occasions.
 He does not smoke at all.'

Support for anti-Semitic policies was received from a Mrs von Ponief in 1930.

She wrote: 'In order to do completely
 Jew-free work, we must require our members to agree not to buy from 
Jews, in this way we can gradually succeed in driving Jews out of 
retailing and thus put the middle-class back in the saddle.'

The letters also show how well 
Hitler’s book Mein Kampf was doing, and in 1932 his publisher wrote to 
him: 'Between the beginning of this year and 21 May we have been able to
 sell a total of 29,385 copies of your work. Therefore we are crediting 
you with a payment of 21,157.20 marks...'

Another writer wanted permission to market 'Hitler Cigarettes', but the offer was declined.

One letter from a Jew showed how integrated into German society they were and how the discrimination surprised them.

Heinrich Herz wrote: 'But what I 
cannot say I am satisfied with is the one-sided treatment of thousands 
of my co-religionists, whose feeling and thinking are just as German as 
mine.

'How much I should like to help build up my beloved Fatherland, if only an opportunity to do so were offered me.'

In 1934, as Hitler built up a head of
 steam, the fawning letters grew in number and included this from 
Stanislaus Jaros, who wrote: 'I am prepared, like my father, even to 
sacrifice my life, when Germany is involved and you, my Leader, call.'

As war approached, correspondents 
kept asking for peace. In 1938, Josef and Elli Jablonski wrote: 'It 
makes us happy and glad to know that peace exists and will remain.'

The correspondence has been gathered in new book Letters To Hitler

As the Second World War headed to its
 conclusion many wrote to Hitler with ideas for new weapons, but the 
letters asking for autographs and showing declarations of support fell 
to zero.

But some remained faithful unto the 
end, like Justizrat W von Zezschwitz, who wrote: 'But it may be granted 
to your prudent, temporising leadership, as we all confidently hope it 
will, at the right moment, with fullest health, to put a compelling halt
 to the enemy who has penetrated so far into German lands in the East 
and the West.'

Dr Harrissaid: 'Through
 the 1930s the letters grow in number and Hitler received many before 
the elections in 1933. And he got thousands on his birthday.

'The high point was in 1938 and then the numbers of letters dropped off quite suddenly when the war started in 1939.

'In the 1930s, the letters show veneration and excitement but also strongly-worded criticism.

'People wrote to complain about 
specific aspects of his policies. In 1934, he received a letter from a 
Jew who was not practising, but still had the confidence to write.

'Surprisingly those who complained 
often received feedback and it is clear that the regime realised the 
importance of popularity.

'Hitler said that popularity was the 
most important aspect of authority and by replying to the letters the 
regime was giving the illusion of paying attention.

'And the longer the war went on the more they needed to enhance their popularity.

'It is also clear what a strategic 
error it was to start the war because the people saw Hitler as someone 
to bring peace and they didn’t want to go to war.

'And they did feel able to write to 
Hitler about it and the letters were carefully filed away and copies of 
replies that were sent were filed alongside the letters.

'There is even one objecting to a relative being sent to Auschwitz.'
