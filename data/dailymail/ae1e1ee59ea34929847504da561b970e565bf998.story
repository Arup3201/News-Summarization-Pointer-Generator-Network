A family whose house became engulfed in flames died of acute smoke and fume inhalation, according to results from an autopsy released on Sunday.

Investigators have not identified the cause of Saturday's fire in McKeesport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which killed a recently married woman, her four young children and her disabled father-in-law.

But the Allegheny County medical examiner's office identified the victims as Hope Jordan, 27; Dominic Jordan, 7; Autumn Jordan, 6; Serenity Jakub, 3; Victoria Jordan, 2; and Ronald Egenlauf Sr., 55.

The sole survivor of the McKeesport blaze, Hope Jordan's husband, Keith Egenlauf, 23, remains in hospital in critical condition. 

Relatives said he was burned over 55 per cent of his body. 

The fire in McKeesport broke out around 6.42am in the two-story home.

Keith Egenlauf and his wife initially fled the flames, but they returned to the burning two-story house in McKeesport, 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, in an effort to save the others, according to their family.

The father and son had lived in the yellow wood-frame house for about 10 years, according to the younger man's aunt Donna Ackerman.

Keith Egenlauf and Jordan were married on December 7, according to their Facebook page.

Andrew Jakub, Serenity Jakub's dad said his daughter lived mostly with him in McKeesport but was visiting her mother this weekend. 

He told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review his daughter was like 'a ray of sunshine' who loved to dance and listen to music.

Laverne Egenlauf, the mother of Keith and wife of Ronald, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette she had recently moved out of the home.

Still, she added, 'He may heal, but he's lost everything.' 

Investigators said the fire off the 300 block of Express Alley is one of the worst in recent memory.
