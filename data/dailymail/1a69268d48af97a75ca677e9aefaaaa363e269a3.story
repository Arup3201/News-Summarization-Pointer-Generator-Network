Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off against Cordoba for punching, kicking and slapping defenders 

Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has once again stated his desire to play in the MLS once his glittering career at the Bernabeu is over.

The Spain international has spent his entire career with Los Blancos after being handed his debut as a 16-year-old and his current contract expires in 2017.

'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure.

'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden..

'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.'

The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. 

US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS.

'Where we are now is we have our national-team players here, and quality Latin players have always been in the league, but the category that has grown most is the name players that are coming,' Gulati told WSJ.
