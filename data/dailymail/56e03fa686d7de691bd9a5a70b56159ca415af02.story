Former Vice President Al Gore has addressed President Barack Obama's lackluster performance in the first 2012 debate, blaming his less-than-stellar performance on the Mile High City.

Denver, Mr Gore said, is five thousand feet above sea level and Mr Obama did not have the necessary time to adjust to the altitude.

'I'm going to say something controversial here,' Mr Gore said on CurrentTV, before dropping his bewildering hypothesis.

Seriously? Former Vice President Al Gore has addressed President Barack Obama's lackluster performance in the first 2012 debate, blaming his less-than-stellar performance on the Mile High City

Face-off: Denver, Mr Gore said, is five thousand feet above sea level and Mr Obama did not have the necessary time to adjust to the altitude

He went on to argue that while Mr Obama had just arrived, the Republican nominee Mitt Romney had been training in Denver.

'Romney did his debate prep in Denver,' Mr Gore said.

'Obama arrived in Denver at 2p.m. today, just a few hours before the debate started.'

The amount of time either candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker's performance, Mr Gore argued.

Challenge: The amount of time eiter candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker's performance, Mr Gore argued

'When you go to five thousand feet, and 
you only have a few hours to adjust...' he said, implying that Mr 
Romney's extended period in Colorado's capital gave him an edge on the 
President.

The other CurrentTV pundits did not buy Mr Gore's theory.

Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), is the term to describe a variety of nonspecific symptoms, acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure, resembling a case of 'flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover,'It commonly occurs above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet) during acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes. The official elevation of Denver, however, is exactly one mile or 5,280 feet (1,609.344 m) above sea level.

'I just came from LA the same day,' Current TV host Cenk Uygur said. 'You know what I did? I drank two cups of coffee coming out here.'

Another hole in Mr Gore's argument is that Mr Obama never spoke more eloquently than in 2008, when the Democratic National Convention was held in Denver and the President accepted their nomination.
