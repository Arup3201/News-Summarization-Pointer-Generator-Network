Women across Brazil have united by taking pictures of themselves, wearing little or no clothing, with the words 'I don't deserve to be raped' in a protest against the attitude that revealing clothing justifies rape.

The online campaign has flooded social media after it was revealed that 65.1 per cent of Brazilians partly agreed with the statement that if a woman was provocatively dressed - she deserved to be abused. Over half of those surveyed were women.

Brazilian women and men of all ages have tweeted pictures of themselves baring all in the controversial campaign to change perceptions in the country.

This woman does a gesture as well as holding the poster which reads '#IDon'tDeserveToBeRaped'. The hashtag #EuNaoMereçoSerEstrupada, which translates as #IDon'tDeserveToBeRaped has gone viral.

'I don't deserve to be raped either' reads this poster. This woman and hundreds of others have rallied in support of the campaign by tweeting revealing pictures

The hashtag #EuNaoMereçoSerEstrupada, which translates as #IDon'tDeserveToBeRaped has also gone viral.

One woman is pictured holding a paper checklist which reads: 'A man without a t-shirt is: hot, is going to play football, wants to be raped - it's obvious'.

The ironic poster then shows the rape answer with a a cross next to it - revealing that this is the correct answer.

Men too have backed the campaign by posting pictures of themselves on social media also holding anti-rape banners bearing slogans such as 'No woman deserves to be raped'.

A shocking 65.1 per cent of Brazilians either partly or wholly believed the statement was accurate. And 66.5 per cent of the 3,810 respondents asked were women.

Another statement said: 'If women knew how to behave, there would be less rape,' with which an astounding 58.5 per cent of people agreed with.

The survey answer came at the same time that the institute revealed that 50.7 per cent of rape victims in Brazil were under 13 at the time of abuse.

The pictures were posted after journalist Nina Quieroz asked women to post pictures of themselves with the hashtag and showing that they loved their bodies in response to the survey responses

'Clothes do not define character!! #No woman deserves to be raped. #I don't deserve to be raped'

She asked women across the country to post pictures of themselves with the slogan on March 28 at 8pm - but two days later posts in support of the campaign are being uploaded.

The journalist said that pictures could be clothed or unclothed - as long as they illustrate that women's bodies belong to them.

The pictures have been shared across the world. One man tweeted: 'No woman deserves to be raped. I am ashamed to be a man and have to say something so obvious.'
