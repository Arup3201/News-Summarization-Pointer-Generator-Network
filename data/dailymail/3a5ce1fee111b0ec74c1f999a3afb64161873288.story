A South Dakota mom's blog post ranting against her sons' school's rules against toy guns has gone viral and won her friends and enemies.

Stephenie Metz, 29, says that, despite a society that might frown more and more on toy guns, she'll always let her sons play with theirs.

'I feel like this teaches them to do the things they want to do, while respecting others' rules and regulations,' Metz writes in a post that also criticizes bullied girls who 'contemplate suicide' and parents who pay too much attention to their children.

Firing off: Mommy blogger Stephanie Metz's rant about bans on toy guns in school has gone viral, angering many but making the South Dakota 29-year-old a hero to others

Her blog The Metz Family Adventures is usually more lighthearted and features posts about their travels, cooking, and her son's type 1 diabetes.

But a post from October 25 titled Why My Kids Are NOT the Center of My World was a bit of a departure.

'This post contains subject matter about which I feel very strongly.  As are most emotionally heated issues,' writes Metz. 'I suppose it's controversial.  But hey, I feel how I feel and that's not going to be changed.'

Metz was provoked into writing the post, which had over 500 comments as of Wednesday evening, by something her son said to her.

Rant: After her son decided not to take an action figure to school because the drill in its hand looked like a gun, Metz fired off a tirade about over parenting and how society should let boys be boys and girls be girls

He was looking for something to take to show and tell and decided on an action figure that held a little drill.

But then he changed his mind: 'I better not take this.  My teacher will probably think it's a gun, and then I'll get in trouble.'

Metz was blown away and began to wonder if her boys, who love to play with toy guns, would one day be the target of hatred because of their 'typical boy-ish behavior.'

Controversial: 'My kids are not the center of my world': The 21-year-old says a bullied girl who 'contemplates suicide' feels too entitled to a 'world-wide pity party'

'How long before they get suspended from daycare???  How long will it be before one of them gets upset with a friend, tells that friend to go away and leave them alone, and subsequently gets labeled as a bully?'

Times are changing, Metz says, and she doesn't like it.

'The mentality of our society in 2013 is nauseating to me, friends,' she writes.

Metz says that there was once a time when boys could be boys and shoot toy guns at each other and 'killing the bad guys.'

'Today, those little boys - if caught doing that - are labeled as threats, and immediate action is taken to remove that threat from the group,' she says.

As for young girls, Metz says their typical behavior is being punished these days, as well.

She writes of an imaginary girl named Susie who is picked on and called names:

'Susie's whole world crumbles around her, she contemplates suicide, and this society encourages her to feel like her world truly has ended, and she should feel entitled to a world-wide pity party.'

Meanwhile, the girl calling Susie names is 'acting like - gasp - a teenage girl acts.'

To be fair, many of the comments on Metz's blog are positive and commend her for daring to question current wisdom about firearms and bullying.

Metz says she has been mindful not to give herself completely into motherhood in order that she not forget the other things she is: wife, professional, and workout enthusiast.

She lets her kids be, she says, in order to make them better people and thinks the world could use a dose of letting kids be.

'I know that I can't change the mindset of modern parents,' she writes. 'I just want to make sure that I raise my sons to grow into respectable men who can thrive and succeed, due to having been prepared to do so.'
