With her soft dark hair and huge doe eyes, her lips gently pursed and her daughter seated on her lap, Annie Barker looked every inch the respectable Edwardian wife.

But with war just around the corner, life for Annie, a mother-of-two who lived in East London, was about to be turned upside down.

After her husband was sent to fight on the Western Front, Annie took a job in a cafe and it was there she would meet and fall in love with a docker named Richard Luck. Tragically, it was a meeting that would have fatal consequences.

‘I have loved this man, and he loves me, from the first time I met him . . .’ Annie wrote in her diary at the time. Less than a year later, Annie’s life was in freefall, ending with her suicide in 1918.

Now the story of Annie and her doomed love affair have been turned into a novel - although this is one tale where the truth is even more shocking than fiction.

'There was great pressure to conform to 
the strict moral codes of the "respectable" working classes,' explains author Juliet West, who first came across Annie's story while working as a journalist at the Daily Mail.

'When war 
came, women were expected to do their duty, to roll up their sleeves and
 support the war effort wholeheartedly.'

In 1915, when Annie was 23, her husband Arthur was called up, joining the Poplar and Stepney Rifles in the December of that year.

With Arthur shipped off to France shortly afterwards, Annie was left to bring up two children on the meagre separation allowance of 3s 6d a week, topped up to 7s by the Government.

It wasn't enough and so, Annie took a job in a cafe. There, she regularly encountered a handsome young docker named Richard Luck and the two swiftly embarked on an affair.

'I can imagine she might have been 
reluctant to work in the munitions factories,' adds Juliet. 'Although the work was 
well-paid, handling the chemicals could have a serious effect on 
workers’ health.

'The café must have seemed a much safer option and 
another perk was that Annie was allowed a meal with each shift. Food 
became scarce as the war dragged on, so this would have been a 
bonus.'

Despite the affair, Annie, who was described by her employer as ‘respectable, sober and hard-working’, continued to write regularly to her husband as he fought in France, Greece and Egypt.

But in late summer 1917, Annie's carefully constructed world came crashing down when she discovered that she was pregnant.

'It would have been clear that the father was not Annie’s husband – he had been away for 16 months without leave,' says Juliet.

'Annie was shunned by her family and forced to leave her job. She moved out of the East End terrace she’d been sharing with her sister without leaving a forwarding address.'

In fact, Annie hadn't moved very far at all, taking her two children and moving in with Luck in a fourth-floor flat in Whitechapel.

But even then she wasn't able to escape the opprobrium heaped on her for falling in love with a man not her husband.

'There’s another "d" word which would have haunted Annie – the notion of disgrace,' adds Juliet. 'It’s not a word we hear so often now, but for much of the 20th century it was a standard insult to women who had fallen foul of the strict moral codes which governed working class families.

'Annie would have been branded a disgrace to herself, to her family, and to her country.'

Worse was to come. In July 1918, six weeks after baby Annie Elizabeth was born, Annie received a letter from her husband that announced he was being allowed home from the Front on leave.

Convinced that his return would mean being separated from her children and a life in the workhouse, Annie could see only one way out.

On the morning of July 18th, police arrived at the flat in Whitechapel to find Annie and her baby lying dead in bed. Both had died from poison. Annie was just 26.

'Well, there are plenty like me,' wrote Annie in what would prove to be her last diary entry. 'I shall not be missed for long.'

Luck, then 32, attempted to follow by throwing himself under a train at Aldgate East station but was unsuccessful and instead found himself under arrest for the murder of Annie and her child.

Two months later, he was convicted of their murder and spent the rest of the war in prison before being recommended for release in 1921.

'The law stated 
that if there was a suicide pact and one person survived, the survivor 
was automatically charged with murder,' explains Juliet.

'Richard was sentenced to hang 
but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after a 
petition was sent to the Home Office.

'In 1921, Richard was recommended 
for release, but there the trail goes cold. The most likely explanation is that Richard 
changed his name when he was released.'

Annie's two children, a son and a daughter, were left to be brought up by relatives while her husband Arthur was devastated by his wife's death.

Baker, a decent, straightforward man, was both bewildered by his wife's actions and left distraught by her death which he was told of in a blunt telegram that read: 'Wife and baby dead. Suicide.'

According to his granddaughter Joan, Arthur 'never recovered from what happened'. 'He tried to drown his misery with 
drink,' adds Juliet. 'He died in hospital in the 1940s.'

Annie herself was largely forgotten, sensationalised in media reports at the time but left in the shadows by her own family who wanted nothing more than to forget what had happened.

'I don’t think Annie was a bad or 
immoral person so I truly think she reasoned it out and
 decided that suicide was the most honourable escape,' says Juliet.

'Poverty plays a huge part.
 There was simply no money, and once her husband discovered the affair –
 he was finally due home on leave in July 1918 - the separation allowance would have been stopped.

'The next option would have been a 
home for "fallen women" or the workhouse. She would have been separated 
from her baby and her older children and she would never have been able
 to live down the shame.'
