If Manchester United’s new-look frontline is going to start firing fours and fives, there’s a still a danger the boys at the back could concede one more.

While we have been salivating over the prospect of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria joining forces with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, reinforcement at the other end of the park was somewhat neglected.

Yes, Marcos Rojo arrived from Sporting Lisbon, but a 24-year-old debuting in the Premier League hardly fills the void left by the exits of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.

Plenty to ponder: Louis van Gaal (centre right) has a wealth of talent going forward but is vulnerable at the back

And then there is Louis van Gaal’s preferred choice of formation: 3-5-2. Rather than mask the shortcomings of those in defence, the system has, thus far at least, left them exposed and seemingly confused.

It does not matter how an opponent attacks them – be it land or air, centrally or wide – panic ensues at every advancement.

Two were conceded at home to Swansea and four at League One MK Dons in the League Cup, the latter seeing Jonny Evans terrorised by lower-league frontmen. Even at Sunderland – a 1-1 draw – United’s backline was shambolic and was spared only thanks to some errant finishing.

Tough start: Manchester United are yet to win this season and are out of the League Cup

Phil Jones is on trial for club and country at present – he’ll line up for England in Switzerland on Monday night – while the international credentials of the injured Chris Smalling will also be under scrutiny on his return.

Luke Shaw remains absent through injury and Tyler Blackett has less professional appearances (16) than his age (20).

There has even been talk of Michael Carrick – another confined to the treatment room – reverting from midfield to centre-back in a bid to aid their cause.

Attacking talent: Manchester United signed Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria in the transfer window 

Settled it is not and Van Gaal and his backroom team will need to put in some serious hours on the training pitches of Carrington over the coming months.

Here, Sportsmail takes a closer at look at who they’ll be working with…

Phil Jones

Sir Alex Ferguson once said Jones could become one of the club’s greatest-ever players. In his defence he’s still only 22 and has ample time to prove Ferguson right, but on recent evidence his former manager’s words appear folly. He is error prone and lacks the defensive cunning of a Ferdinand or Vidic.

(Defensive) Rating: 6.5/10

Error prone: Phil Jones is struggling to live up to the hype of his early career 

Marcos Rojo

He was labelled Argentina’s weak link prior to the World Cup but played his part in the team which finished second to Germany and emerged with his reputation enhanced. But at £16m and given the defensive woes at Old Trafford, there is already pressure on him to right their rearguard wrongs – and that is perhaps too much expectation given his lack of experience.

Rating: 7/10

Unknown quantity: Marcos Rojo has not played for Manchester United yet following his move

Jonny Evans

He’ll be in no hurry to return to Stadium MK. But League One looked about his level during the Capital One Cup humbling and that would have done little for his confidence. He is, of course, far better than that showing but questions remain over his credentials as a United starter.

Poor display: Jonny Evans had a nightmare evening against MK Dons in the League Cup

Chris Smalling

Smalling and Jones were supposed to be the future of United and England. Both, however, are fighting to restore damaged reputations. Smalling is yet to mature into the leader many hoped he would and, at 24, this is a big season for the former non-league defender.

The future? Chris Smalling has yet to mature into the leader that many expected him to become

Luke Shaw

There has already been much debate over his fitness and physique and, before he’s even kicked a Premier League ball for the club, the 19-year-old finds himself under the spotlight. If Van Gaal is to persist with 3-5-2 then Shaw – an orthodox left-back – will have to learn how to adapt his game to a wing-back posting.

Teenage kicks: Luke Shaw became the most expensive teenager in England when he joined for £30m

Tyler Blackett

The 20-year-old has started the season in the side but isn’t expected to stay there. At Sunderland, in particular, he was torn between his centre-back duty and filling the hole at left-back exposed by Ashley Young’s reluctance to defend. This backline is hardly the preferred environment to blood a promising youngster.

Rating: 6/10

Young hope: Tyler Blackett has made a number of appearances this season but could soon be replaced 

Rafael

Injury means he is yet to feature this season but a wing-back role would surely be to his liking and there is little competition at right-back should Van Gaal switch to a traditional four.

Rating: 7/10

On the sidelines: Rafael has missed the start of the season due to injury 

Michael Carrick

He has previously impressed at centre-back but that was in a team on the front foot. It will be a different scenario entirely were the midfielder to find himself under siege.

Rating: 6/10

Moving back: Michael Carrick is a midfielder but has impressed at centre back in the past

Daley Blind

He’s been brought to the club as a midfielder but he nonetheless appeared in defence for Holland under Van Gaal and could well find himself back there were their problems to persist.
