From the moment of birth to adolescence to becoming a woman, the relationship between a mother and daughter is complex, sometimes challenging and constantly evolving.

Photographer Julia Fullerton-Batten has explored the dynamic bond in a poignant series of work entitled Mothers and Daughters.

She enlisted dozens of mother and daughter pairings to pose for her work, but was mindful of creating a superficial environment.

'I only needed to orchestrate the 
sitters moderately to show the essence of their emotional bond. They 
created their own small world together, at the same time, through the 
staging of the scene, reviving my memories of my own family's 
relationships,' she told My Modern Met.

She told the website that the photos show the full cycle of the relationship - 'the babe-in-arms is fully dependent on the 
mother, but at the other end of the age sale, the mother often becomes 
dependent on her daughter to satisfy her emotional needs.'

The project was inspired by the German photographer's past - she reflected on her mother's relationship with her three daughters as well as their grandmother.

Ms Fullerton-Batten was born in Bremen and spent most of her childhood in Germany and the 
United States, before moving to the UK when she was 16.

She now lives in
London and studied studied photography at the Royal Berkshire College of Art
and Design.

She started her professional career in 2001 and is now a 
well-established professional photographer, rapidly developing a
reputation as one of the leading young photographers in Europe.
