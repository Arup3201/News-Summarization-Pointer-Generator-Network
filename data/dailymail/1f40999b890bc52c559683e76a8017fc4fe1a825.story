'First what I do is get my tape measure and then I measure its circumference and get the weight of the product.

'People like to know whether its rigid, flexible or floppy and if it has balls as well.' Explaining the secret of writing product descriptions for dildos, editorial assistant Cazz Thornton plonks a plastic member onto a set of scales.

It might sound bizarre but for Cazz, and the rest of the 130 strong workforce at Lovehoney, Britain's biggest sex toy retailer, this is business as usual.

And its certainly not a job for the faint-hearted. From dealing with queries on butt plugs to dispensing advice on how to escape from a chastity belt and sending out more than 3,000 orders a day, the staff at the company certainly have their hands full.

Now a new fly-on-the-wall series are to go behind the scenes at Lovehoney, shedding light on the goings on at the Bath-based retailer, whether developing new toys or fielding queries from customers.

The business was founded in 2002 by a pair of former technology journalists, Richard Longhurst and Neal Slateford who identified a gap in the market for non-seedy sex toys for women, long before E.L James made whips and nipple clamps a regular part of the nation's sex life.

After an initial £9000 investment, the company is now worth £30m. 'All of the websites were presented in a 
really pornographic way and it was people coming from the porn world 
into the sex toy world and trying to sell products that way online,' explains Longhurst of his eureka moment.

'We came at it from a totally different way - we're both internet nerds 
and it's a female-friendly website.'

Now he's hoping that sales will get another boost in the shape of the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey film, and hopes to cash in via the company's official 50 Shades range.

'It was such a blindingly obvious thing to 
do,' explains Slateford. 'There's this massive best-selling book with loads of sex toys in it 
and obviously, it has got to be good to get the license to do sex toys
 based on the book.'

Having approached author E.L James for approval, Lovehoney launched its 50 Shades range, which includes a spanking paddle, riding crop and love balls, in 2012 and recouped the initial investment within four months of the launch.

Now, with filming for 50 Shades of Grey: The Movie well under way, the pair are excited about the retail possibilities and have sent a selection of products to director Sam Taylor-Wood in the hopes they'll feature in the film.

'We've sent a 36" bamboo cane, a red Swarovski crystal 
nipple clamp and ostrich feather tickler [among other things],' explains Longhurst. 'It's a once in a lifetime 
opportunity.'

If they're used, however, it won't be the first time that a Lovehoney product has enjoyed a moment in the spotlight.

'We had one of our 50 Shades products, the Sweet Sting riding crop, in a Britney Spears video,' adds a gleeful Longhurst.

'It was for her smash hit song, Work 
B***h.' Mischievously, he adds: 'Britney can obviously recognise quality when she sees it.'

Although Longhurst and Slateford take centre stage, the new series looks set to make stars of the rest of the Lovehoney staff as well.

Along with editorial assistant Cazz, later seen gamely packaging up a buzzing 'sex machine' to send to an eager reviewer, there's sweet former bank worker Chelsea who spends her days fielding inquiries about the correct way to use vibrating eggs, and Andrea Bartlett, doyenne of the returns department.

Donning rubber gloves as she unpacks an eye-opening selection of returned items, Andrea specialises in reading out the complaints, many of which are hilariously funny, straight-faced before offering a sympathetic quip to colleagues, Roy and Jax.

'This is Bam, one of our big boys,' she explains, a giant 12" dildo drooping gently in her hand. 'It turned out to be too large so they sent it 
back. Whatever floats your boat I suppose.'

Reading from the accompanying note, she adds: 'Sorry to have to sent this item back - he is too big for a 4ft 10" 
girl. If you could send me a six inch, that would be fine.'

'She probably took one look at it and crossed her legs!' laughs Andrea.

Elsewhere in the company, Lovehoney staff are seen doing everything from compiling product reviews to giving their opinions on quirky items that range from the 'armadildo', an armadillo shaped member, to the 'winter willy warmer' and Slateford's latest invention, the vibrating finger.

'Right now this is basically a pumpkin carver with a couple of latex fingers stuck on the end,' he chortles. 'It's really powerful!'

Working at Lovehoney is clearly not for the faint-hearted, although all of the staff appear to love what they do - even if it does make telling their parents what they do tricky.

'You never know how people are going to 
react when you tell them you're running a sex toy business,' says Longhurst, who only plucked up the courage to tell his mother about the business long after he established it.

'I
 didn't know how she was going to react so I kept it quiet from her for a
 bit,' he continues. 'I remember when I was younger, at the age of about eight, calling 
my sister a dildo at the dinner table and my mum flew off the handle, 
she went absolutely mental!

'She was like, "Do you know what a dildo is? 
Do you know what that is?" and I didn't so she said, "It's a rubber 
penis!"

'I remember thinking to myself, "Why would anyone need a 
rubber penis?" Now,' he adds, laughing, 'I know.'

All clear: Roy checks a naughty French maid outfit to make sure its 100% unused and thus, resellable

Tough job: Andrea prepares to inspect Jessica, the deluxe 'teddybabe' returned to her department

200 items appear in Andrea, Jax and Roy's in-tray each day and range from vibrating love eggs to 'teddybabes'.

Each comes with a note explaining why it didn't make the grade. Here are five of the funniest read out by Andrea:

On 'teddybabe' love doll Jessica:

'It was the wrong type you sent - this is the deluxe model instead of the smaller standard. I also think it looks ugly.'

On a purple dildo:

'Why am I returning this? I bought it for my girlfriend and as soon as 
she opened it, she laughed at me, slapped me round the face with it and 
put it back in its packaging. She demands that I send it back. It's 
unused.'

On the Earth Love Doll:

'This has been returned because my son is only 15 and his parents 
were not happy when this arrived in the post!'

On the Lovehoney snug plug:

'I am returning my items as I found with the Lovehoney snug plug, it 
was slightly too small. With the cock rings, I found them too 
uncomfortable to wear and they ripped out some of my public hair. I 
would like to have a refund if that is possible.'

On a pair of handcuffs:

'I
 am returning the items enclosed for various reasons. The sleeve with balls 
split and some balls came out inside my wife. The handcuffs were thrown at 
me and my wife called me a b***** for thinking of using them.'
