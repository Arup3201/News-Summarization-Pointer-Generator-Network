The pilots of a Southwest Airlines flight that mistakenly landed at the wrong Missouri airport were grounded Monday, less than a day after they touched down at a small airfield that gave them only half as much room as normal to stop the jet.

Southwest declined to name the veteran pilots of Flight 4013, which was traveling Sunday evening from Chicago's Midway Airport to Branson Airport but instead landed at tiny Taney County Airport seven miles away.

No one was hurt, but after the 124 passengers were let off the plane, they noticed the airliner had come dangerously close to the end of the runway, where it could have tumbled down a steep embankment if it had left the pavement.

Uncommon around these parts: A small crowd gathers at the M. Graham Clark Airport in Hollister, Missouri Monday to see Southwest Airlines jet that landed there by mistake. The pilots who mistakenly landed the jet there Sunday were grounded Monday pending an investigation

Whoops: Pictured is the flight path of Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 on Sunday. The flight, carrying 124 passengers and five crew members, was scheduled to go from Chicago's Midway International Airport to Branson Airport but somehow veered 9 miles off course

'As soon as we touched down, the pilot 
applied the brake very hard and very forcibly,' said Scott Schieffer, a 
Dallas attorney. 'I was wearing a seatbelt, but I was lurched forward 
because of the heavy pressure of the brake. You could smell burnt 
rubber, a very distinct smell of burnt rubber as we were stopping.'

Scheiffer tweeted that the pilot informed passengers that they were at a smaller airport.

After the jet stopped, a flight attendant welcomed passengers to Branson, Schieffer said.

Then,
 after a few moments, 'the pilot came on and said, "Ladies and 
gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport."'

Passengers were kept on board for about 75 minutes before the doors opened.

'We
 have all deplaned from @SouthwestAir 4013, and the mood is somber now 
that we realized we were 40 feet from the edge of a cliff,' Schieffer 
tweeted.

Southwest 
spokesman Brandy King said it's common for pilots to be grounded while 
the airline and federal aviation officials investigate.

Both
 pilots are Southwest veterans. The captain is in his 15th year flying 
for the carrier. The first officer will mark 13 years in June, the 
airline said.

At first, Schieffer said, he 
considered the error only an inconvenience. But once he got off the 
plane, someone pointed to the edge of the runway, which he estimated as 
about 100 feet away.

'It
 was surreal when I realized we could have been in real danger,' he 
said. 'And instead of an inconvenience, it could have been a real 
tragedy.'

Mark Parent, 
manager of the smaller airport also known as M. Graham Clark Downtown 
Airport, described the distance as closer to 300 feet. He said the 
runway is built partly on landfill. At the end, there is a 'significant 
drop-off,' with a ravine beneath it, then busy U.S. 65 on the other 
side.

Welcome to Branson? Confused passengers were first told by a crew member they'd landed at the correct destination. A pilot then spoke on the intercom: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport

Wrong runway:  Flight 4013 from Chicago landed at Taney County Airport instead of Branson Airport. The Boeing 737-700 carried 124 passengers and a crew of five

He said a Boeing 737 had never landed at the small airfield, which normally handles light jets, turboprops and small aircraft for the charter, corporate and tourism markets.

No one was at the airport when the Southwest flight landed. Airport employees had gone home about an hour earlier but were called back after the unexpected arrival, Parent said.

The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating, but agency spokesman Tony Molinaro declined to elaborate.

At the time of the landing, around 6 p.m., skies were clear, with the temperature in the 50s, said Jeff Bourk, executive director of Branson Airport.

Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said there were 124 passengers and five crew members on the flight. He also said the landing was 'uneventful.'

'Our ground crew from the Branson airport has arrived at the airport to take care of our customers and their baggage,' Hawkins said. 'The landing was uneventful, and all customers and crew are safe.'

He said he had no explanation for why the jet landed at the county-owned airport, which primarily serves charter, corporate and general aviation flights. It was originally developed by the College of the Ozarks.

Tony Molinaro, Federal Aviation Agency spokesman for its central region, says the FAA is investigating the incident.

Where they landed: The jet landed at Taney Airport. The runway is half the length of the one at Branson airport

The flight was scheduled to go from Chicago to Branson, and then on to Dallas.

After last nights landing, passengers were then bussed to the correct airport to continue their journey.Â 

The M. Graham Clark Airport started as a dirt runway in the late 1960s. The longest of the two asphalt runways there is 3,738 feet.. At the commercial Branson airport, the concrete runway is more than 7,000 feet in length.

In December, Southwest Airlines announced it will cease operations at the Branson Airport in June after serving the airport for about 15 months.
