A dying Bristol City supporter inspired his beloved team to victory on Saturday and saw the Robins move out of the League One relegation zone.

Mark Saunders, who suffers from lung cancer and has just days to live, was granted access to the club's Ashton Gate dressing room and delivered a rousing team-talk to the team's players.

Attending his last-ever game, the 54-year-old and his brother Bill were invited into the dressing room after club officials found out about his illness.

However Mr Saunders took the opportunity to give 
the players a firm ticking off for their recent poor form - and 
delivered an emotional speech which left some players choking back 
tears.

He told them 
in no uncertain terms how ‘privileged’ they were ‘with their flash cars 
and huge wages’ and one last win would grant his dying wish.

The
 rousing pre-match ‘Fergie hairdryer’ speech inspired the team to a 2-1 
win over Gillingham - lifting them out of the relegation zone with only 
their third win this year.

Mr Saunders' brother Bill, from Bristol, said: ‘He said he was going to speak to them and I told him he better ask the manager.

‘He
 marched right in and Steve Cotterill [the manager] was at the front 
with his clip board and he tapped him on the shoulder and asked if he 
could speak to the team.

‘He said yes, and got all the players in from the treatment rooms and everything, and Mark just went for it - it was brilliant.

‘He said he had followed the club for 30 years and had gone through some scrapes as a fan.

‘He
 said that people traveled all over the country to follow and support 
them and it was a pity that the players weren't fighting like the fans 
are.

‘He said how privileged
 they all are. That they should think of their mum and dad who took them
 training every wet and cold Wednesday night so they could follow their 
dreams.

‘He said "I've 
walked past all your flash cars in the car park, I know how much you get
 paid, you should remember how lucky you are".

‘He
 said how privileged they should feel that fans go across the country to
 follow them every step of the way and they had to step up their game 
and give something back after they had been so poor and so disappointing
 to so many people this season.’

'This is a family right here, Bristol City. We the fans, when we are out there, we have each other's backs - we help each other out. You guys, you need to work together as a team.

'You've got your wages and your fancy cars in the car park - just remember who you are playing for. When you pull your shirt on remember this is our club. We pay £80 a week to come see you play - that's half or quarter a man's wages. We follow you because we love the club.

'And you need to get it sorted and get out there. You get your kits, your rubdowns - but just remember your mum and dads who stood with you and took you to practice before you got that. Now get out there and win this match.'

The team were apparently stunned into silence and hanging on Mark's every word before they erupted into applause.

The
 inspired team powered onto the pitch and put in one of their best 
performances of the season with impressive goals from Simon Gillett and 
Sam Baldock.

Bill, an 
electrical wholesaler, said: ‘I think it did make a difference. Mark was
 sat between the two goal scorers for the photo. I think it made them 
think twice about things.

‘I just wanted to make it a special day for him and I think it was.’

Married Mr Saunders  was diagnosed with lung cancer in April last year - just a month 
after his brother Ken was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus.

Sadly Ken, 57, passed away in December and weeks later Mark was told the disease had spread to his brain and was terminal.

At
 the start of last month he was told he could have as little as six 
weeks left, and in the last few days the disease has stolen his ability 
to talk properly.

He knew 
that the Gillingham fixture last weekend at City's Ashton Gate home 
ground would be the last he would be well enough to attend.

Mr Saunders, who has three older sons with wife Wendy, is splitting his final time between the family's home in Bristol and a hospice.

Speaking after the match, manager Steve Cotterill said his players had been put in their places by Mr Saunders' emotive speech.

He
 said: ‘He wanted to have a little chat with the players as he didn't 
feel as though he was going to see next Friday out, which puts football 
into a bit of perspective.

‘We were quite choked in the dressing room. What can you say to someone like that?

‘He
 gave a little speech to the lads and it was more or less his dying wish
 that he wanted three points today, so what we want to do is dedicate 
that win to Mark and his family.

‘It was tough to listen to him, it's quite emotional just thinking about it, but hopefully we gave him a good weekend.’

Ahead
 of the game, Bill posted on Facebook fan sites inviting all his 
brother's friends to join them in a number of pubs before the game on 
Saturday.

More than 500 people turned up to share a drink with their pal before they headed to Ashton Gate.

The changing room visit was arranged by Bill's friend who is related to City owner Steve Lansdown.

Bill added: ‘It was very emotional, but then the last eight months have been like that, so I'm kind of used to it now.

‘I've been to every oncology appointment with him and I just wanted to make it a special day. I think it was.’
