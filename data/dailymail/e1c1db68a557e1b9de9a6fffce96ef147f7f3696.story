Model Katie Cleary is beginning to share the details of the days leading up to the suicide of her estranged husband, Andrew Stern, 40, who fatally shot himself in the head at a California shooting range on June 22.

‘His last e-mails and text messages to me were very truthful and heartfelt conveying the message that he was trying to do whatever he could to make his life better despite his own personal challenges,’ Katie wrote in the caption of a photo of Andrew she has posted on Instagram.

The former America’s Next Top Model contestant also shares the last message she ever sent to Andrew, as he fought his losing battle with crippling depression: ‘Whatever God brings you to, He will bring you through.’

Harbinger of healing: 'I had to post this picture again after watching Heaven Is For Real,' she writes. 'An angel appeared in our pic in Lake Como. I know Andrew is healed and at peace with the angels in heaven'

Good times: Katie says she will never forget the man she shared some of the most important things in life with

Katie was caught cozying up to Leonardo DiCaprio and Adrian Grenier in Cannes just weeks before Andrew's death, with some friends believing the revelation of Katie’s flirtations sent her husband over the edge.

It’s a claim Katie denies, and the animal rights activist went on CNN’s HLN on July 28 to refute the rumors before talking about the plight of Borneo’s orangutan population, which is in danger of losing their habitat to palm oil plantations.

‘I loved him very much,’ Katie, 32, said. ‘He was my heart and soul and the fact that this happened the way it did is so tragic and he was a huge animal lover and I wanted to do something to honor his memory.

'And so me and my foundation, Peace 4 Animals, decided to purchase a piece of land in Borneo on behalf of him through World Land Trust and I think this is the best way to honor him.’

Cozy: Katie was photographed in Cannes with Leonardo di Caprio last May, a month after Andrew filed for divorce 

As MailOnline reported, just days before the television interview Katie learned Andrew left her nothing in his will, which he signed in 2007 — three years before their marriage. Instead, the late entrepreneur’s parents are the sole beneficiaries of his estate, including $408,000 of savings.

But Katie seems to harbor no anger toward Andrew, who had filed for divorce in April after four years of marriage.

‘I will never forget my love, best friend and someone who I shared some of the most important things in life with,’ she writes in her tribute message on Instagram.

Katie's father, Thomas Cleary, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, told MailOnline last month that his daughter is distraught by her husband's death.

'This is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my son-in-law.'

The one-time Deal Or No Deal beauty reveals the extent of her pain. ‘My heart is heavy with such a sadness of loss that I had never thought imaginable. Andrew was a wonderful human being with such a big heart who did so much to contribute and help others,’ she writes.

Last photo: Just hours before he killed himself, Andrew was partying with a group of friends at a trendy Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. He posted this picture on his facebook page

‘He was always a person who went out of his way to be a mentor and leader to those closest to him. Andrew had a smile and laugh that radiated and that will always be etched in my memory.’

‘The last 5 years we spent together have been some of the best and most challenging times of our lives and helping Andrew through these trials and tribulations in his life have given me a perspective that shows how life is so precious and fragile and should be cherished every moment of every day,’ says Katie.

She has maintained she officially split from Andrew eight months before his death and that the photos of her with Leonardo at the Gotha nightclub during the Cannes Film Festival in May were harmless.

Katie 
recently posted another Instagram photo that shows her with Andrew at 
dinner on a vacation they had taken to Lake Como in Italy. In a corner 
of the photo a bright orb hovers over them — and Katie claims it’s a 
sign Andrew is now okay.

‘I
 had to post this picture again after watching Heaven Is For Real,’ she 
writes.Heaven is for Real is a films about a little boy's trip to heaven.

‘An angel appeared in our pic in Lake Como. I know Andrew is 
healed and at peace with the angels in heaven.’

Pet project: Both Katie and Andrew were avid animal rights activists. Katie's foundation has purchased a piece of land in Borneo to aid the orangutan population to honor here late husband

‘May God bless his soul and everyone he has touched throughout the 40 years we were blessed to have him here on this earth,’ Katie says in her tribute to Andrew, adding ‘I will always love you, your memory will live on and you will never be forgotten.’
