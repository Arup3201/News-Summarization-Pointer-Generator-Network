West Ham United's move to the Olympic Stadium is being hailed as a step to the future by the club's owners.

And finally the dream to turn the Olympic Stadium into a world class football stadium is taking shape as the Hammers' look to become a club capable of challenging Europe's elite.

West Ham co-owner David Sullivan revealed astonishing ambition earlier this week, claiming that the stadium should help the club fight for titles and European trophies within five years.

To many fans, including those who support the Hammers, it was taken with a pinch of salt. But why not? The move to the Olympic Stadium certainly gives them the foundations to work with.

The original stadium, which was designed as a largely temporary venue and never intended to host Premier League football, cost £429million to build, with the conversion costing a further £154m.

But when complete, the facilities on offer will be the benchmark for luxury hospitality in world football, providing seats with unrivalled views of the action.

To start with the West Ham faithful were cautious when it came to walking away from the Boleyn Ground, a place they have called home since 1904.

But impressive membership sales hints that fans have been won over by the visions of the club, accepting that it's time to move on if they want their side to be competing with Europe's elite.

Already membership for The Royal East lounge has completely sold out, less than four months since it went on sale, and following the form of The Forge 1895 lounge which reached capacity in December.

Just 50 places remain available in The Arnold Hills lounge, a relaxed dining area named in tribute to the visionary founder of West Ham.

West Ham will leave the Boleyn Ground and move into the stadium in time for the 2016-2017 season

Work to turn the stadium into a suitable home for a football team continues 

And The Boleyn, the club's dedicated matchday fan bar, has also been a popular choice with more than a quarter of the tickets already snapped up. 

West Ham United Vice-Chairman Karren Brady said: 'We have been delighted by the enthusiastic response to our Club London offering.

'We can promise all the supporters who have signed up as members that the facilities and matchday experience will exceed all their expectations. I look forward to welcoming them all to our first game in 2016.'
