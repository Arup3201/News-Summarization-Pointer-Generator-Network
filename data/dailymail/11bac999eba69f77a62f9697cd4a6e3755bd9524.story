Police are searching for Kyshan Van Der Zanden, right and his daughter Lylah, centre, after he allegedly snatched her from her mother Gemma Mountney, left

Spanish detectives have launched a hunt for a Belgian man who snatched his toddler daughter away from her British mother.

Kyshan Van Der Zanden, 22, made sure that his partner Gemma Mountney was out of the house all day by treating her to shopping vouchers and a trip to the spa.

He then packed up his and his daughter Laylah's belongings from their Alicante home and fled before the 21-month-old's mother returned.

Ms Mountney believed that Van Der Zanden had dropped the little girl off at nursery earlier, but instead he had hidden her with friends while he got her mother away from the house and packed.

Although Ms Mountney called the nursery after noticing some of Van Der Zanden's belongings were gone when she returned home at lunch time, her partner had told nursery staff to lie to her because he had planned a surprise family day out.

It wasn't until early evening when she went to pick up her daughter that Ms Mountney discovered the ploy and called police.

Ms Moutney, who moved to Spain from Thame, Oxfordshire, ten years ago with her family, said: 'It is absolutely heartbreaking.

'He was the single person in the world who I thought would never do something like this - I'm devastated.

'I
miss Laylah so much and I just want her back in my arms and to be 
giving her a huge hug. I thought he loved and cared for me and Laylah - 
clearly not.

Van Der Zanden told Ms Mountney that he had taken the couple's daughter to nursery school

'If I could speak to him I would just urge him to bring her back. Bring her back to her mum so I can just hold her in my arms.'

She met Van Der Zanden on a night out three years ago.

They
set up home together in the coastal town of Calpe, and as far as Gemma,
a full-time mother, was concerned, everything was perfect.

Speaking today she said: 'It was absolutely fine. When he came back 
from apparently dropping her off at nursery he gave me a kiss and told 
me he loved me.

Ms Mountney's family have been appealing for information on Facebook

'[I went out 
for my facial and went to the shoe shop he had given me vouchers for - 
looking back he was doing his best to make sure I was out of the house 
all day.'

'He had called the nursery in the morning and told them she wasn't going to be coming in.

'He said he had a surprise for all of us as a family - to go and have a lunch and a family photo shoot - and to lie if I called up.'

The Guardia Civil - the Spanish police force - has issued alerts to airports and ports all over Europe.

Ms Mountney said they are now treating it as a kidnap case and her family has taken to Facebook in a bid to track down Laylah by publishing family pictures.

She noticed Laylah's passport and identity cards were missing two weeks ago, but when Van Der Zanden said he thought they had been lost and offered to organise replacements, she took his word for it.

She fears Laylah and her father might be on the run in his home country of Belgian where his parents Nancy and Peter Van Der Zanden still live - or in Dubai where his father has business links.

Two days after Laylah went missing, Ms Mountney's family finally got through to Van Der Zanden's mother who at first claimed she had no idea anything was wrong - but then slammed the phone down.

Hours later she admitted she 'knew where Kyshan was' but put the phone down and has not been in touch since.

Van Der Zanden distracted Ms Mountney, pictured with Laylah, by giving her shoe shopping vouchers and treating her to a spa trip

A spokeswoman for reunite International Child Abduction Centre, confirmed the charity was working with the family.

He said: 'It's so sad every time we see it, but what is particularly upsetting in this case is how young the little girl is.

'She must be very confused at the moment and probably doesn't understand what is going on.

'The
first step we need to take is to establish exactly where her father has
taken her, which the Spanish police are currently assisting with.

'Once
we know where the little girl has been taken we can then help the 
mother decide what the best option is with regard to getting her back 
safely.

'Unfortunately cases
like this are rising and we are now seeing over 500 cases per year of 
children being abducted by their parents.'

A spokesman for Guardia Civil in Calpe said they were aware of the case and were investigating.

Police believe that Van Der Zanden may have returned to his native Belgium with his daughter
