 President Barack Obama will announce his intent to nominate prosecutor Loretta Lynch for his next Attorney General tomorrow, a move that would give the top U.S. law enforcement role to a low-key prosecutor with deep experience in both civil rights and corporate fraud cases.

A statement released by the White House Press Secretary on the Attorney General Nomination said that President Obama will make the announcement in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, and will be joined by Attorney General Holder and Ms. Lynch.

Lynch, 55, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would be the first African-American woman to hold the job if confirmed by the Senate

'Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. Attorney’s Offices in the country,' says a White House Press Statement.

'She will succeed Eric Holder, whose tenure has been marked by historic gains in the areas of criminal justice reform and civil rights enforcement,' concludes the statement.

President Barack Obama also played coy today  before the official announcement when asked by a reporter if he'd settled on a particular candidate. 

'You’re going to be the first to find out, Major, along with everybody else,' Obama facetiously told CBS News' Major Garrett before The White 

Earlier today, Sources close to the Obama administration told Reuters that
Lynch was a top contender to replace outgoing Attorney General
Eric Holder, who announced in September that he would resign.

The sources said they expected that if Lynch were selected,
she would generate little controversy, making for a smooth
Senate confirmation process.

Her nomination will be one of the first big changes for
Obama to announce after Republicans won control of the Senate in
congressional elections on Tuesday. Lynch was one of several
candidates Holder had recommended to succeed him.

Lynch emerged as a leading contender after a previous top
choice, former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, pulled out
of consideration amid concerns her involvement in controversial
Obama administration decisions could complicate her
confirmation. 

Other candidates who were reportedly being considered were Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Perez may have undergone special scrutiny in the Senate confirmation process, however, over a 'secret deal' he allegedly cut with the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, when he worked at the Justice Department. The issue came up in a 2013 confirmation hearing when he was under consideration for labor secretary and would be a sticking point again if Obamahad chosen him.

Holder, one of Obama's closest allies, had a rocky
tenure as attorney general. He clashed frequently with
congressional Republicans over gun control, same-sex marriage,
and a desire to try terrorism suspects in civilian instead of
military courts.

In one 2011 email released earlier this week, Holder
referred to Republican members of the House Oversight Committee
chaired by Darrell Issa as 'Issa and his idiot cronies.'

A Greensboro, North Carolina, native, Lynch earned her
college and law degrees at Harvard, worked in the Brooklyn U.S.
Attorney's office between 1990 and 2001, and served in the top
post from 1999-2001 and since 2010.

Lynch developed a close relationship with Holder through her
work on the attorney general's advisory committee, which she has
chaired since the beginning of 2013.

In her first stint in the U.S. Attorney's office she oversaw
the prosecution of New York police officers who were convicted
in connection with the torture of Haitian immigrant Abner
Louima, an incident that became a national symbol for police
brutality.

More recently, her office has brought several high-profile
cases, including the indictment, in April, of New York Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican, for fraud.

Her office has worked closely with Justice Department
headquarters on several big corporate fraud cases, and helped
investigate Citigroup Inc over shoddy mortgage securities
the bank sold, which led the bank to enter into a $7 billion
settlement in July.

Lynch's office also was involved in the December 2012 $1.2
billion accord with HSBC over the bank's lapses in its
anti-money laundering controls.

Prosecutors in Brooklyn are also investigating a member of
Putin's inner circle, Gennady Timchenko, in connection with an
oil trading and money laundering probe.
