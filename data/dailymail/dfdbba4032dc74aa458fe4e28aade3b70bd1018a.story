The boyfriend of young mum Becky Ayres, who was stabbed to death at her home, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder.

The 25-year-old man, named locally as Liam King, is being questioned by police on suspicion of murdering Becky, 24, at their home in Salford, Greater Manchester and remains in custody.

According to one of Becky's friends she was about to end her relationship with Mr King after the christening of her three-year-old son Riley this Sunday.

One friend said: 'Its such a tragedy, Becky was a devoted mother to 
Riley and a lovely friends. We were all heartbroken. Riley was due to be
 Christened on Sunday but we heard Becky had been unhappy in her 
relationship with Liam.

'He doted on the little the boy but things 
weren't working out between Liam and Becky. It's possible that the fact 
they were living together meant they were getting under each other's 
feet.

'We believe she wanted out and was planning to end their 
relationship after the Christening. Everyone's devastated - the real 
tragedy is her little boy who will now be without his mother.'

Becky and Mr King were in the same year group at Wentworth High School but only struck up a relationship in late 2012

Becky and Mr King were in the same year group at Wentworth High School but only struck up a relationship in late 2012.

Neighbours also reported hearing screams and shouts coming from the house in the run up to the grim discovery.

Chief Superintendent Mary Doyle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'A woman has been killed and our thoughts 
are with her family and friends at what is obviously a totally 
devastating time for them.

'I would like to reassure residents that 
we do not believe there is any danger to the community, we believe this 
is an isolated incident and are not looking for anyone else in 
connection with her death.

'We have a team of highly skilled 
detectives already working on this case but if anyone has any 
information they think can assist please call us.'

Becky's son Riley was not at home at the time and had been staying with a relative

Tributes from friends of Miss Ayres flooded in from friends and social media users.

Close friend Lee Blackman, 24, who used to live with Becky, said: 'I feel sick, this can’t be real. She was a beautiful person.

'I’m truly shocked at the moment, I’m numb. We used to work together and rented a flat.

'She was a lovely girl and will be sorely missed.

'She had a son Riley, my heart goes out to him.'

Natalie Cadogan Leigh wrote: 'God bless you Becky taken away so early in life.

'My heart goes out to your family and friends at this most difficult thing they have ever imagined.

'Salford has lost another Beautiful Lady and you are truly honored and will not pass in vain. God bless.'

Riley was not in the property at the time of Miss Ayres' death and was on a sleepover with relatives.

Friends of the boy's father, who is in the armed forces, said they had been left ‘gutted’ by the loss of a ‘wonderful girl’.

Greater Manchester Police said they are not looking for anybody else in connection with the death.
