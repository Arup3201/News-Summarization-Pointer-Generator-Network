The company which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to oil giant BP has been fined $1.4billion after admitting its role in the Gulf of Mexico disaster that triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.

Swiss-based Transocean pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act after its rig exploded in April 2010, killing 11 workers and spewing millions of barrels of oil into the ocean.

The deal with the U.S. Department of Justice comes after BP agreed its own $4.5billion settlement with authorities back in November over criminal charges relating to the disaster.

The U.S. Department of Justice said Transocean admitted its crew members were 'negligent in failing fully to investigate clear indication that the Macondo well was not secure and that oil and gas were flowing into the well'.

BP, which has long argued that it was not the only company responsible, said: 'In settling, Transocean has acknowledged that it played a significant role and has responsibility for the accident. Transocean is finally starting, more than two-and-a-half years after the accident, to do its part for the Gulf Coast.'

Under the terms of the proposed deal, Transocean will pay its fine over five years, and the Department of Justice will not pursue further prosecution of the company.

Assistant attorney general for the US Justice Department's Criminal Division Lanny Breuer said: 'Transocean's rig crew accepted the direction of BP well site leaders to proceed in the face of clear danger signs - at a tragic cost to many of them.

'Transocean's agreement to plead guilty to a federal crime, and to pay a total of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in criminal and civil penalties, appropriately reflects its role in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.'

Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well, is the only company not to have settled over the disaster.

BP said: 'Unfortunately, Halliburton continues to deny its significant role in the accident, including its failure to adequately cement and monitor the well.'

The oil giant pleaded guilty to 14 felony 
counts relating to the fatal explosion in November last year.
The plea agreement
included 11 manslaughter charges, plus one felony count for obstruction
of justice relating to BP's false statements made to Congress about the
amount of oil leaking from the well.BP will pay $4.5 billion in fines and other fees to settle the charges - the largest payment of its kind in U.S. history.

Last
month it was reported that BP was sending a team of investigators to 
check if any further oil is leaking from the site of the 2010 spill.

The
oil giant was set to investigate whether an oil sheen revealed by 
satellite pictures was evidence of a possible new leak from the 
containment dome put in place to secure the site, according to a CBS 
News report.

There were 
more than 100 crew members on board the rig at the time of the explosion
on 20 April 2010, including seven BP employees and 79 Transocean team 
members.

Meanwhile the full environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon disaster is still unknown almost three years later.

Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days after the explosion before it was finally capped.

Almost 70,000 square miles of the gulf were at one point covered in oil slick - an area roughly the size of the state of Oklahoma.

More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill.

Many
dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination.

The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the 
government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will 
collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf.
