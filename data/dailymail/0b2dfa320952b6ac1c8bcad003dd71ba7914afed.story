A nurse who successfully fought Maine's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients may be free to go wherever she pleases, but her boyfriend has been told to continue to stay away from the campus where he's a nursing student.

Ted Wilbur insists that the University of Maine at Fort Kent (UMFK) asked him to stay away after his girlfriend, Kaci Hickox, hit the headlines amid attempts to quarantine her after she returned from treating Ebola patient in West Africa.

The university contends he voluntarily agreed to stay away, and the voluntary agreement remains in effect.

Ted Wilbur remains barred from returning to his studies at the University of Maine at Fort Kent despite his girlfriend Kaci Hickox being declared 'not contagious' by state officials on Friday

Ray Phinney, associate dean of student life and development at UMFK, said on Monday that the university is willing to revisit the agreement.

‘I am not concerned he is a threat to anyone’s health,’ Phinney told The Bangor Daily News. ‘My only concern is how the other students would react to him being here.’

However some of Wilbur’s classmates have expressed concerns about him returning to class sooner than November 10, when the 21-day Ebola incubation period expires for Hickox, admitted the dean.

'Ted is aware there are some real concerns,' Phinney said. 'Most [students] are concerned about the "what ifs," like, "What if Kaci begins to show symptoms?"'

Hickox, who contends that she poses no real danger because she's not showing symptoms, fought attempts to quarantine her after returning from Sierra Leone last month.

A Maine judge sided with her on Friday, rejecting the state's attempt to restrict her movement.

The big 'What if?' Some of Wilbur’s classmates have expressed concerns about him returning to class sooner than November 10, when the 21-day Ebola incubation period expires for his girlfriend

The judge signed a final order on Monday. Even with the order, Hickox has said that she plans to stay away from public places out of respect for local residents.

She and Wilbur live together in Fort Kent in an off-campus home.

Steve Hyman, one of Hickox's lawyers, said there's no reason for Wilbur to be prevented from setting foot on campus.

He said attorneys plan to talk to Wilbur to see what he wants to do between now and November 10, when the incubation period ends.

While Hickox completes her monitoring period, Wilbur has been participating in his UMFK accelerated nursing program via online classes.

He admitted to the media last week that taking his classes online was not ideal and prevented him from taking exams or participating in on-campus assignments.

‘No matter what, the safety of our students is our number one concern and that extends to Ted,’ said Phinney.
