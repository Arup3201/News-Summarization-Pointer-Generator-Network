A wife went into a blind panic when she opened a letter from the council that said her husband had died after he had nipped down the local for a pint.

Bernadette Atkinson, 51, and the couple's son Karl arrived home to find the letter but no sign of her husband Anthony.

Mr Atkinson, 52, had popped out for a swift drink only to return an hour later to find his wife in 'hysterics'.

The letter, from the Chorley council tax department, read: 'Please accept my apologies for writing to you at this time, but we have received information that Mr Anthony Atkinson has sadly passed away.'

'Nearly had heart attack': The letter from Chorley Council's tax department stating that Mr Atkinson had died which his wife found when she arrived home

It goes on to ask Mrs Atkinson to call a member of staff to 'provide further information'.

Karl, 26, said: 'My mum nearly had a heart attack. My dad wasn’t in when we got home - he had gone out - and we were busy reading that my dad was dead.

'It turns out he went to the pub for a pint with his brother, but we didn’t know where he was and all of a sudden this letter was saying he had died.

'He had been in the house all day and so would have been in when the post arrived, but because it was addressed to my mum, he didn’t open it.

'My mum was in hysterics.'

To their surprise, Anthony walked back through the family’s front door around 45 minutes later.

'My dad was understandably really angry,' said Karl. 'It was a bit of a strange situation, because he was reading a letter saying he wasn’t with us anymore.'

Blunder: Mr and Mrs Atkinson are now seeking an apology from the council for the letter and want to find out who the information came from and why the letter was sent

Karl phoned the council and says he was told the information had come from the registrar, but when he contacted the register office, they could not find a record of his father’s death.

After visiting the council offices, he claims he was given a different explanation.

Karl, a bakery worker, said: 'The story changed to say a distraught family member had been in touch saying that my dad had died.

'I’m really angry. It’s really unprofessional of them.'

To add insult to injury, Mr Atkinson was even reminded to pay the council tax during one phone call with the council.

The family is now seeking an apology from the council for the letter and wants to find out who the information came from and why the letter was sent.

Karl added: 'It seems nothing is happening. They haven’t told us whose fault it is or where they got the information from.'

An investigation has been launched by Chorley Council.

Gary Hall, Chief Executive of Chorley Council said: 'We have apologised unreservedly to Mr Atkinson and his family, both in person and by letter which has been accepted by them.

'I can understand the distress it must have caused them.

'We received the information in good faith and went through our usual checking process.

'However, there have obviously been some problems with it in this case and we are investigating what happened to make sure it doesn’t happen again.'
