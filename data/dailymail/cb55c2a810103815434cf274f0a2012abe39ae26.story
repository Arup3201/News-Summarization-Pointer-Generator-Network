Luis Suarez will  be allowed to make his La Liga debut in the El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona, despite the match being moved forward by a day due to television demands.

The former Liverpool striker's ban was due to end on October 25 - the same day the La Liga clash at the Bernabeu will now take place  - but Suarez becomes eligible from midnight on October 24. 

The original fixtures placed the El Clasico on October 26 but the Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed Suarez's suspension will  end hours before the rearranged match, should manager Luis Enrique hand him his debut against Real.

Permission: Luis Suarez will still be allowed to make his La Liga debut in the El Clasico against Real Madrid

Allowed: The match was moved forward by a day due to television demands but Suarez can still play

Phew! The former Liverpool striker's ban   ends midnight on October 24 - the day before the El Clasico

Oct 21: Barcelona vs Ajax (Champions Lg)

Oct 24: Suarez's ban ends at midnight

Oct 25: Real Madrid vs Barcelona (La Liga)

Barcelona responded after a Sportsmail enquiry, and said: 'It has also been confirmed (on Wednesday) by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) that Uruguayan Luis Suarez will be able to play in the game as his suspension will have been served.'

The Uruguay striker was slapped with a four-month ban from all football-related activity and given a nine-game international suspension by FIFA for biting the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil.

Barcelona appealed the decision in the CAS following Suarez's £75million switch from Anfield to the Nou Camp on a five-year deal.

The La Liga club did so in the hope it would be reduced to two months, but the suspension was upheld. Suarez was, however, cleared to make his debut in a friendly against Mexico's Club Leon and given permission to train with his new team-mates.

Happy about that, Luis? Suarez will be eligible to play, should Luis Enrique hand the striker his La Liga debut

At the time, a CAS statement read: 'The sanctions imposed on the player by FIFA have been generally confirmed. 

'However, the four-month suspension will apply to official matches only and no longer to other football-related activities (such as training, promotional activities and administrative matters).'

Suarez will also play with Lionel Messi and Co in the second El Clasico of the season at the Nou Camp on March 21 or 22.

Changed: The El Clasico was drawn to be played on October 26 when the La Liga fixtures were announced

Training: Suarez's ban was upheld but the striker was cleared to train with his new Barcelona team-mates
