For the past days and nights, they had waited in this great city in the rain. Swathed in pale blue and white, they had waited for their little genius to take the next natural step forward, waited for him to bring the greatest trophy home across the border.

Lionel Messi was ready, after all. He had achieved everything else over these past years. And, during a compelling month in enemy territory, he had brought Argentina to this final almost on his own.

But not all stories end the way they might and last night Argentina's captain could not put his signature to the final chapter.

He had the opportunity, too. That is what will haunt him.

Messi played well enough for 90 
minutes as Argentina subdued what most thought would be superior 
opposition, but when the defining chance came early in the second half 
he couldn’t take it.  

It was a proper opportunity too, the type he consumes without blinking for Barcelona.

Played in down the inside left channel by Lucas Biglia, Messi suddenly had green space ahead of him.

When
 he is operating at his instinctive best, these chances fly past 
goalkeepers so fast they hardly hear them, never mind see them. Top 
corner, near post, is usually a decent bet.

Here,
 though, Messi dragged his shot across the goal and wide. The replays 
made it look better than it was. It lacked conviction and it was never 
going in.

A goal then and a 
strangely introverted German side may not have recovered. As it was, the
 Europeans hauled themselves to extra-time and, once they were there, 
the reserves of energy afforded them by a semi-final stroll against 
Brazil became apparent.

Messi’s
 own father had actually expressed doubts about his son’s ability to 
maintain a persistent threat deep in to this tournament. According to 
Messi Snr, his boy had been feeling heavy-legged.

Unsurprisingly,
 there was little sign of that last night during regulation play. World 
Cup finals have a habit of providing adrenaline surges.

Beyond
 that and in to extra-time, though, the 27-year-old began to feel the 
effects of the great weight he has carried here over the last four 
weeks, namely his nation's hopes, and an extended semi-final against 
Holland last Wednesday.

On 
the way to the stadium here yesterday, the Argentina supporters crammed 
on to Rio's metro system and sang songs in his honour. This, they felt 
sure, was to be his night, the occasion he gave tangible credence to 
their claims that Argentina produces better footballers than Brazil.

At
 times, he looked as though he may produce as his performance fitted 
with the narrative of his tournament. His moments of recognisable genius
 were fleeting but they were still there.

The
 skip to the by-line past Matts Hummels early on was from the classic 
Messi play book, so was the imperious pass he played out to Ezequiel 
Lavezzi not long after. The cross that followed was side-footed in by 
Gonzalo Higuain, but he was offside.  

There were other moments, too, times when the burners came on and he accelerated past white shirts.

In
 extra-time, though, Messi’s influence receded. Early in the added 
period he should have been at the far post to convert a low cross from 
Sergio Aguero.

Aguero was playing as a substitute, though, and Messi was not. By that time his race was run and he was not alone.

Earlier
 on in the day, Messi had emerged from the team bus looking a little 
uncomfortable, a little cowed. It appeared, just momentarily, as though 
expectation hung heavy.

Four
 hours later his final act of the day was to trudge sombrely to the 
presentation platform twice, once to accept the Golden Ball and once his
 loser’s medal. Only FIFA could put a losing finalist through that and 
not once did his expression change.

He
 place in the pantheon remains, of course. He doesn’t need a World Cup 
winner’s medal for that and it should be remembered that this is some 
way from a great Argentina team.

Victory here would have put him in the elite company of his some of his heroes, though. His chance may not come again.
