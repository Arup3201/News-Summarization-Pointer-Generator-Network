Margherita Missoni has welcomed her first child - a baby boy named Otto Hermann Amos - in Sumirago, Italy.

The fashion heiress, 30, and her racing driver husband Eugenio Amos, 28, announced the happy news via Twitter and Instagram.

According to WWD, the newborn was ten days overdue, and Margherita had impatiently been charting her growing bump and preparations for Otto's arrival on her Instagram and Twitter feeds.

The last update before the birth came on Thursday when she revealed that she had broken her wrist while out walking in the countryside, and would be induced.

Posting a photo of herself with her husband, bandaged writs in shot, she wrote: '#KeepOnSmiling #BrokenWrist #WhenTheGameGetsToughJustLaugh @eugenioamos spend the last few hours as a twosome #waitingforotto shouldnt take much longer [sic]'

Then yesterday, she posed a photo of a tiny blue knitted sweater bearing the name Otto by way of a birth announcement, accompanied by the words: 'Hello! Finally #ottohermann! [sic]'

The name Otto, which is also the Italian
word for 'eight' pays tribute to Ottavio Missoni, Margherita's 
grandfather who died earlier this year. Hermann is a family name on the 
Amos side.

The birth marks the arrival of the fourth generation of the Missoni fashion family.

But while Margherita's Instagram feed paints a portrait of a joyful pregnancy, she admitted in an interview recently that she has been affected by recent strains on her family.

Not only did they have to cope with Ottavio's passing, but they had to go through the 
disappearance and subsequent death of Vittorio Missoni, Ms Missoni's uncle and marketing 
director for the family brand.

'Of course, it was especially hard for me because I'm pregnant,' she told The Times in a profile published last month.

Ready and waiting: Margherita posted intimate snaps of her baby's nursery while waiting for his arrival. Fashion consultant and stylist Coco Brandolini created these pillows for Otto

'I've
had a very intense pregnancy, with all the things that have happened, 
but it wasn't my father; other family members have had a harder time.'

She credits the Missoni family's strong bond for getting through the year.

'It has helped that there are so 
many of us and we are so tight. It's easier than if I were having to 
face it all on my own,' she said.

It is the first time a member of the
family has spoken publicly about Vittorio since his plane, which went missing off the coast of Venezuela, was 
discovered in June.

He, his partner, Maurizia, two friends and two crew members 
were en route to mainland Venezuela from the Los Roques archipelago when
their small aircraft went missing on January 4.

Months of searches 
began and the aircraft was eventually found in deep water off the coast 
of the South American country on June 28.
