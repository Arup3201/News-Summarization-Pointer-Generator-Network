To see their children settle down and start a family of their own is a common desire among parents the world over.

But while many know they can only nag their children about it, mothers and fathers in Shanghai have a more hands-on approach.

Parents and relatives of unmarried sons and daughters take matchmaking into their own hands by searching for suitable partners at the 'wedding market' in the Chinese city's People's Park.

Parents and relatives advertise their unmarried children at 'wedding market' at Shanghai's People's Park

Whereas men vastly outnumber women across China, in Shanghai the roles are reversed.

Professional matchmaker's charge hundreds of pounds to desperate parents in a bid to find their unmarried daughter a suitor.

Every Saturday and Sunday afternoon, parents flock to the park to peruse the hundreds of advertisements left there.

Song Li, who founded an online dating 
service, told CNN that, unlike the rest of China, there are almost three
times as many women looking for husbands or boyfriends. 

Therefore she charges more than £300 for women to join her service - but men can join for free.

She said: 'There is a shortage of superior men'.

Some parents at the park even admit their children do not know they are being advertised at Dating Corner.

The market, set up in 2004, has a corner specifically for parents of children who live abroad.

One mother said she goes to the market in search of a partner for her 36-year-old daughter who lives in Toronto.

She told CNN she wants to find someone who is tolerant, open-minded and has a stable job for her daughter.

However, she said: 'I can't give you my name because my daughter doesn't know I'm doing this and I don't want her to find out.'

The small adverts hung from strings in the park cost about £2 and are displayed for five months.

For an extra £10 fee, people are given access to phone numbers.

The strips of paper consist of people's height, salary, age, job, education, home town and occasionally more details about their family values and personality.

As well as parents, there are also professional matchmakers who make a living from trying to find suitors.

The market has previously been described as 'match.com meets farmers' market' but it aims to help solve the gender imbalance. 

China's One Child Policy and the importance of family lineage both fueled the need for the market.

Increasing numbers of educated, career driven women - of 'left-over women' - are also delaying marriage.

Selective abortions because of the one-child policy means far more males are born than females - 118 boys to 100 girls.

There are now 20million more men under 30 than women of the same age and the gender imbalance is continuing to widen
