When motorcycle fanatic Brian Hill spotted the bike of his dreams on sale for around £40 he was heartbroken.

It was 1968 and as a penniless, 21-year-old student he couldn't scrape the funds together to buy the Vincent HRD classic.

Instead he advised his friend John Lumley to snap it up, insisting it was a fantastic find that would one day pay off.

For more than 40 years the pair still kept in touch from time to time and Mr Hill, from Longfield, Kent, always joked that he was now able to pay John £40 for the bike.

In 2009, he received a sad phone call to say John had passed away from pancreatic cancer - but in an unexpected final gesture of kindness, he had left Mr Hill the 1937 Vincent Rapide in his will.

The value of classic motorbikes has rocketed in the intervening years, and the rare motorcycle would now be expected to fetch around £225,000 if put up for auction.

When Mr Hill received the British-built Vincent, the 15th of just 78 ever made, it was still in bits in the original tea chests it was first sold in.

But he was determined to ride the bike just as he had always wanted, and spent eight months and around £10,000 restoring it.

Mr Hill, now 66, said: 'My father used to have a Vincent motorbike when I was a child and they really got into my blood.

'He sold it in 1960 when I was only 13 and so I never had the chance to enjoy it. When I got my bike licence I decided I wanted a Vincent. One day I was at a bike meeting when I saw an amazing model, the Rapide, that was made in the 1930s.

'I fell in love with it straight away. Two or three years later I had a call from a friend who told me there was a 1937 Vincent Rapide for sale on the south coast.

'He said it was in bits in a box and that the seller wanted £50 for it.

'Back then £50 was a lot of money and I was still a student. I asked my dad for the money but it was about four times his mortgage and he said no.

'Seeing as I couldn’t buy the bike I phoned a friend of mine, John Lumley, and told him about it.

'John was a bit older and had a good job so he could afford to buy it.'

Time capsule: The classic bike arrived in two tea chests and had to be assembled by Brian from scratch

Time and effort: Brian spent eight months and more than £10,000 restoring the Vincent

'He went to see the seller and managed to knock a tenner off so he got it for £40.

'We remained friends and every few years when I would see him I would joke that I had the £40 to buy the bike now, and he would just smile at me.'

Mr Hill said he had no idea that John would have been so generous as to leave the much sought-after Vincent to him.

He added: 'It was very sad to hear John had died but at the same time I was told he had kindly left me the same Vincent Rapide I had told him about all those years ago.

'I was incredibly touched by the gesture. When the bike arrived it was still in bits, in exactly the same condition it was in in 1968.

'I never thought for one moment that after 40-odd years I would own the very same bike. I knew John would have wanted me to use the bike so I spent £10,000 restoring it over eight months.

'It is a beautiful bike that still turns heads 75 years after it was made. I’m determined to get out and ride it as much as I can - it’s what John would have wanted.'

Vincent Motorcycles were once among the most desired models in the world.

The company was founded in 1928 by Philip Vincent after he acquired a small motorbike manufacturing firm by the name of HRD Motors.

Based in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, engineers built high-speed motorbikes primarily for the expanding market in the United States.

In 1948, the 'Black Shadow' was hailed as the world's fastest production-made motorcycle.

A 1952 998cc model set a six-hour world speed record at more than 100mph - an incredible achievement for the era.

The tiny British company was so far ahead of its time, it wasn't until the 1970s that Japanese manufacturers came along with faster production machines.

Vincent Motorcycles was forced to cease production in 1955 after suffering heavy financial losses.

But the fantastic machines built in just 27 years of production have become a cult favourite among enthusiasts and collectors.

A string of models have recently sold at auction for more than £200,000.

Earlier this year, a Black Lightning model sold at auction for a whopping £246,000.
