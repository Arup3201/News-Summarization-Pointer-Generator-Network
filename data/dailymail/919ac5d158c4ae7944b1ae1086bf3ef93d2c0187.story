A top Hollywood banker who is suing the Los Angeles police after officers allegedly beat him up claimed to have taken bath salts just two days earlier, it has been revealed.

Brian Mulligan, who serves as vice chairman of media for Deutsche Bank, claims he was brutally attacked by the LAPD, leaving him bruised, bloodied, and with lacerations across his face.

He has denied allegations by the police that he had admitted taking marijuana and bath salts - but he was recorded talking to an officer about his drug use just two days before the LAPD encounter, according to CBS This Morning.

Bruised and broken: Deutsche Bank's Brian Mulligan, pictured left, before surgery, and right, after surgery to repair various lacerations and a nasal fracture; he alleges he was attacked by the LAPD last May

Mulligan, 53, was stopped by the LAPD
three times on the night of May 15 last year - the third time when he 
was seen allegedly trying to break in to moving cars.

When
officers tried to subdue him, the high-profile executive was injured, 
and eventually when to hospital with multiple facial lacerations and a 
broken nose.

The police
report on the incident claimed Mulligan had said he was high on bath 
salts and marijuana, but the banker's lawyer denied this.

However,
it has now emerged that on May 13 he told a Glendale police officer he 
had been taking 'white lightning' - another name for bath salts, which 
are a form of synthetic methamphetamine.

The
officer made a recording of the 10-minute encounter, which started when
Mulligan approached the police saying: 'I know this is gonna sound 
crazy, but I feel like there are people following me - I feel like there
was a chopper, do you hear a chopper?'

When
the policeman assured him that he was not being followed, Mulligan 
described himself as 'a little paranoid', adding: 'I could be nuts.'

The
officer asked him if he was on medication, and Mulligan replied: 'My 
lawyer will kill me if I say this, but I went to a head shop and I 
bought some of that white lightning stuff... I don't know what it is, 
but it was bad.'

As the policeman warned him about the dangers of the fashionable drug, the banker said, 'I've probably used it 20 times.'

The officer continued his caution and concluded: 'It will continue to become worse if you don't stop.'Mulligan
said that he had last taken the drug two weeks previously, though he 
appeared to accept that he was still suffering from its effects.

The
tape has been turned over to the LAPD, who have said that based on 
audio analysis and the recollection of the officer involved, they are 
satisfied that the man on the recording was indeed Mulligan.

According to an initial police 
report, Mulligan appeared 'out of it' after officers responded to 911 
calls about a man trying to break into people's cars at a drive-thru in 
Highland Park.

Mulligan seemed to be 'under the influence based on his behavior', Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told MailOnline.

Officers said they were told by Mulligan he was high on marijuana, had ingested ‘white lightning,’ and had not slept for four days.

The bank executive was spotted wandering in a confused state by passers-by at around 10.40pm on May 15.

Due to his erratic behavior, officers called a senior officer to the scene, who carried out a drug evaluation.

Mulligan told officers he was 'tired and exhausted' and asked to be escorted to his car so he could collect his belongings to go to the local Highland Park Motel.

When they reached the vehicle, there was a large amount of money in the car, causing officers to call for back-up. Mulligan was then left at the motel by officers without further incident.

He said, she said: Police officers said they found Mulligan walking near this Los Angeles-area Jack-in-the-Box

At around 1am that night, the same officers who dropped Mulligan off at the motel responded to reports of a man trying to get into vehicles.

They saw Mulligan
in the street, running into oncoming traffic. Officers called him 
back on to the sidewalk, but rather than comply, Mulligan assumed a
‘combative stance’, striking martial arts poses.

At that point, officers claimed they 
were forced to subdue Mulligan, adding that a ‘use of force then 
occurred' before he was arrested.

The businessman's injuries required him to be admitted to hospital for facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures. 

In August this year, Mulligan sued the LAPD for $50million, saying that he was battered by the police during the encounter.

According to court documents, the Deutsche
Bank executive further alleged that the LAPD officers in question were 
holding him hostage at the motel where he was staying as a means to 
steal the $5,000 he had on his person at the time.

Held hostage? Police say that he requested to be taken to the Highland Park Motel to rest, but his lawyer claims he was held hostage there

Mulligan’s
lawyer Michael Flanagan said in his claim that the officers stopped him 
on a sidewalk in Los Angeles and discovered $5,000 cash in his car.

At that point, Mr Flanagan said that his client was driven to a hotel and told he would be killed if he attempted to leave. 

He was also told that he would not be allowed to call his wife Victoria, to let her and their children know where he was.

When, after a few hours, Mulligan did try to leave, Mr Flanagan said that police found him and beat him mercilessly.

'At that point, he was in such great fear that he believed the LAPD officer were not truly LAPD officers but may be impostors bent on robbing or killing,' the suit reads.

Mulligan was booked for resisting arrest as well as interfering with law enforcement.

The Deutsche executive suffered facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures, which will require extensive reconstructive surgery.

His attorneys estimate that the incident has caused him the loss of $500,000 already and in the coming years, amount to a loss of $5million.

Mulligan, a graduate of the 
University of Southern California, has worked at numerous high-profile 
firms, including Fox, NewsCorp, and Universal Studios.

Premiere Magazine voted him as one of the '50 most powerful people in Hollywood' and the Los Angeles Business Journal voted him 'One of the 10 most prominent bankers in Hollywood'.

From
2003 to 2008, he served on the board of Napster as the Director, 
Chairman of Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and a Member
of Executive Committee.
