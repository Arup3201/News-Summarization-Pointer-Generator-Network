A rare video has captured the moment a beluga whale gave birth to her calf in an aquarium in south-central China.

The footage captured at Changsha Underwater World in Hunan Province shows eight-year-old white whale Zhuo Ya birthing her calf while a number of spectators look on, the Telegraph reported.

The whale can be seen swimming around her tank with the tail of her baby emerging from her body.

When the calf fully emerges following a five-hour labour, gasps can be heard from excited onlookers.

The baby quickly swims off and is later seen at the surface of the water, taking its first breaths in the company of its mother.

Staff at the aquarium said it was the first time a beluga whale had given birth in China.

Zhuo Ya carried her baby for fifteen months before giving birth on Tuesday.

The beluga whale was brought to China from Russia in 2010.

She will be given a two-year break from performing for visitors so she can properly care for her baby.

Staff will also monitor the baby whale's progress, including when it starts to take breast milk.
