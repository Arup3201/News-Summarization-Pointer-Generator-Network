A Ukrainian porn-star is hoping to become the first in her profession to be granted asylum in the European Union because of her job.

Anastasia Grishay, who is known by her screen name Wiska, claims that she is being persecuted in her home country because of her work on porn films.

She is requesting asylum from the European Union after fleeing to the Czech Republic in 2010 when she was investigated for allegedly producing and distributing pornography.

The Czech authorities have rejected her asylum request but Ms Grishay intends to appeal to the European courts.

Ms Grishay told The Times: 'I have been given 15 days to leave the country. They don’t care that we can’t go back to Ukraine.'

The actress, in her early thirties, claims she was forced to flee Ukraine after welfare officers threatened to take her children into care because her job made her unsuitable to be a 'worthy mother'.

She added: 'I was left alone with a child, worked as a model in various magazines. When I was asked to star in a porno movie I accepted because I needed the money. I have been trying to explain that I did not do it out of a love for the business but because I had to feed my son.'

Ms Grishay now has three children with the youngest born in the Czech Republic.

The porn-star is being supported by Femen, a group of Ukrainian feminists who stage provocative demonstrations such as stripping naked outside parliament and cutting down crucifixes.
