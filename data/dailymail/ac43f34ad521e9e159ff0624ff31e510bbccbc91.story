Nigel Farage has boasted he is fighting fit for the general election after he lost weight while giving up alcohol for January.

The Ukip leader used a major speech in the Movie Star Cinema in Essex to set out his party's pitch for May 7, where everything from popcorn boxes to a smart car had been branded in Ukip colours.

Ruling out a coalition with either Labour or the Tories, Mr Farage set out Ukip policies including taking workers on the minimum wage out of income tax and scrapping tuition fees for science and engineering students.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared at the Movie Star Cinema in Canvey Island, Essex to set out his party's pitch for May 7

Mr Farage boasted that he had lost weight and could now get into old suits after giving up alcohol for Dry January, but that didn't stop him tucking into Ukip-branded popcorn

Mr Farage used his first speech of the election year to claim that the Ukip 'people's army' will shake the Establishment in the general election on May 7.

Appearing in Canvey Island, Essex, the Ukip leader was introduced on stage by Castle Point candidate Jamie Huntman who claimed Mr Farage 'refreshed the parts that other politicians cannot reach'.

The party leader joked that it was 'very nice of him, after a dry January'. Mr Farage would not say how much weight he has lost, insisting he had not 'looked at the scales'.

But he said: 'I did do 'dry January' and have lost a substantial amount of weight doing so.

'I'm fighting fit for the upcoming campaign. I didn't weigh myself at the start of January or at the end but I am wearing suits that I haven't squeezed into for years.'

Mr Farage is famous for enjoying a pint of beer in front of the cameras but was overheard saying he 'wouldn't mind a G&T' as he arrived at the venue. 

The unlikely health regime did not stop Mr Farage from tucking into a tub of Ukip-branded popcorn as he appeared at the cinema.

Mr Farage used his speech to rule out entering a coalition with either Labour or the Tories after the election

With the polls showing that no party is likely to get an overall majority in May, Mr Farage ruled out entering a formal coalition government with either Labour or the Tories. 

He said the three main parties do not 'believe in Britain' and predicted Ukip would win 'significantly more' than two or three seats.

The only firm 'red line' commitment he made during the speech was that the party would not compromise on its call for an EU referendum.

Mr Farage added: 'We will not enter a coalition, no matter how tempting ministerial cars may be.

'We will only do a deal with anyone on the condition that there is an in/out referendum on the EU.'

He said Ukip was the only party standing up for the little man and that it would not engage in 'dirty politics' as its opponents 'turned nasty'. 

Ukip branding for the event covered popcorn boxes, posters, balloons and even a smart car

Mr Farage claimed his party was digging in to 'the ethnic community vote', adding that there would be 'lots of Ukip candidates' from minorities in the general election campaign

Castle Point is a key target seat for Ukip, with Mr Farage predicting his party will win 'significantly more' than two or three seats natonwide

Mr Farage also claimed his party was digging in to 'the ethnic community vote', adding that there would be 'lots of Ukip candidates' from minorities in the general election campaign.

He told the crowd: 'We have crossed the class barrier in British politics. That is a remarkable achievement for Ukip and we pick up support from across every social spectrum.

'And we are also beginning now to dig quite deep into some of the ethnic community vote in this country as well, because people that have come to this country legally, that have made this country their home, that have integrated within our society, they want the Ukip agenda as much as anybody else.

'And what you will see during this election campaign are lots of Ukip candidates from the ethnic minorities. It is something the commentariat in Westminster probably won't understand but I think all of us in this room do.'

Mr Farage, who is running to be an MP in South Thanet, said the party's policies - aside from taking the UK out of the EU - included taking those on the minimum wage out of tax, scrapping tuition fees for science and engineering students, stopping HS2 and injecting £3bn more a year into the NHS.

He added he would 'fight' for a right of recall for MPs and axe taxes such as the so-called 'bedroom tax' and Labour's mooted mansion tax.

But last night he claimed the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies.

He said: 'We will have a fully-costed manifesto, with policies across a range of issues. But I actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates. We are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic.

'It's about a state of mind, an attitude. We are on the side of the small guy, we are on the side of patriotic people, we believe in a Britain that is free and independent with a proper border control policy, and people know that.'

Labour frontbencher Jon Trickett said: 'No single speech is going to hide UKIP and Nigel Farage's long-held beliefs on increasing NHS privatisation and further tax breaks for those at the top.

'The truth is UKIP are a party of Tory people, Tory policies and Tory money: they are more Tory than the Tories.'
