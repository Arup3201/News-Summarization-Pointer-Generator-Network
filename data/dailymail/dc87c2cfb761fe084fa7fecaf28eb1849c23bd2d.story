A police officer accused of Tasering to death a black ex-Marine is due to appear before a court in a separate $10million racism and brutality case.

Anthony Carelli is accused of attacking Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 67, after he accidentally triggered a medical alert in his sleep.

The former marine was shot by a stun gun and beanbag guns as officers arrived at his apartment in White Plains, New York. He died the same day.

Carelli is also one of six police officers accused of beating two brothers as they were arrested - and describing them as 'rag heads' in 2008, the New York Post reported.

Jerry Hatter, who is of Jordanian descent, was left with a black eye after allegedly being beaten by officers in 2008. His brother Salameh Hatter was also attacked.

The brutality case - unrelated to the death of Kenneth Chamberlain Snr - is due to go before a court on April 23.

The brothers claim they were handcuffed to a pole in a police station and beaten with batons.

Although no criminal charges were ever brought, the pair are taking action in the civil courts.

The pair claim they did not resist arrest.

As it was revealed that Carelli is to appear in court, union officials called for him to 
get a fair hearing over the death of Mr Chamberlain Snr who was shot in 
the early hours of November 19.

Police had withheld Carelli's name since he fired the shots last autumn. He now faces an anxious wait to see if he will be indicted by a grand jury over the shooting.

Kenneth Chamberlain's son Kenneth Jnr told the New York Daily News: 'I’m for (Officer) Carelli getting a fair hearing.

'Let the facts speak for themselves. 
But did my father get a fair hearing? No, he (Carelli) played judge and 
executioner right then and there.”

The victim, who had also worked as a correction officer, died in hospital hours after he was Tasered.

At
first officers said the shooting was 'justified' as self-defence 
because the 'deranged' victim had first attacked officers with a hatchet
and knife.

But, four months later, a grand jury is now being convened to look into alleged inconsistencies in the record of the involved officers' version of events.

Victim: Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, 67, who was shot twice with a Taser by officer Carelli

This is because fresh evidence, in the form of a recording from medical alert company LifeAid purporting to reveal everything said inside the apartment, has come to light.

Two videos which capture some of the incident, from a building security camera and also attached to a stun gun used by the police, have also emerged.

Lawyers for Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Jr, say police were called to the sleeping 68-year-old's housing project home in the early hours of the morning.

He had accidentally triggered his LifeAid pendant and then failed to respond to calls.

On arrival he told officers banging on 
his door they were not needed. But they heard banging come from the 
apartment and thought someone could be in serious danger.

An hour-long stand-off ensued and he became more agitated as he saw armed police arriving.

On
the recording an officer is apparently heard screaming 'I don't give a 
f*** n*****, open the door', a second yells 'I need to use your bathroom
to pee', while others taunted him about his military background.

Claims: A chronically ill heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and Tasered him twice in the chest (file picture)

On one of the videos, police are 
shown prying part of the door open. A metal object, which could be what 
police thought was a hatchet, slips through the gap and falls in the 
hallway.

They remove the 
hinges to the door and, on entering the flat, see Chamberlain standing 
in his boxer shorts, with his arms at his side and hands empty.

Family lawyer Mayo Bartlett, a former 
Westchester assistant district attorney, told the New York Daily News: 
'The minute they got in the house, they didn’t even give him one 
command.

'They never mentioned 'putyour hands up.'
They never told him to lay down on the bed. The first thing they did 
... you could see the Taser light up ... and you could see it going 
directly toward him.'

Uproar: The case is similar, some say, to the killing of Trayvon Martin (left) by George Zimmerman (right) which sparked outrage because the latter has never been arrested

Almost 200,000 people have signed an online petition demanding justice in the case.

Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore confirmed a grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this month.

The outrage follows the shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin, 17, who was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, in February.

Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence after being sucker-punched by the teen in a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

The fact Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the U.S.

Confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman's criminal past, and Trayvon's history of truancy, drugs and graffiti.
