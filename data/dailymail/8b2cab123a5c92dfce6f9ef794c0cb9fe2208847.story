New shoes, new Novak. Sometimes the simplest solution is best and so it came to pass that a change of footwear helped stop Novak Djokovic skidding out of these Championships.

For two-and-a-quarter hours he slipped and stumbled, complaining about his trainers as he blew a one-set lead — losing the next two 6-3, 7-6 to Marin Cilic.

At one stage, in the third set tiebreak, he lunged for a drop shot and got tangled in the net. The biggest fish in the draw didn’t look like he was worth keeping.

Then came a signal to Boris Becker in the coaching seats and down came a new pair of shoes. He found his footing, his backhand and, more significantly, distracted himself for long enough to win the final two sets 6-2, 6-2.

On the slide: Novak Djokovic had trouble with his footing against Marin Cilic

Footwear: Djokovic called for a change of shoes to get back in the match

‘Maybe with the shoes it was just a mental thing,’ he said. ‘Whatever, it worked.’ What is in no doubt is the top seed will need to tighten up his act for his semi-final against Grigor Dimitrov.

Normally so composed, it was surprising to see the Serb riled by the noise drifting into Court No 1 as Andy Murray’s defence of his title ended in the central arena.

‘I think both of us thought it was too much in a way,’ said Djokovic. ‘With Andy losing in straight sets, it was obviously a result that all stadiums, even on Court One, wanted to see. I said to the chair umpire, “Let’s just stop the match, put it live on the big screen and let’s watch it until they’re done. It’s going to be better for all of us”.’

With every groan, he got more agitated. His backhand, normally so effective, lost its direction, while Cilic emerged from an attack of nerves in the first set to dominate with huge groundstrokes.

Going the distance: Djokovic needed five sets to beat Cilic

But in winning the third set he committed the error he felt turned the match in Djokovic’s favour. He had just broken the No 1 seed for 6-5 when he followed through on a smash and hit the net with his racket in the first point of his service game. He went on to lose his serve, which seemed academic when he won the tiebreak 7-4, but the effect lingered.

‘That changed the momentum around,’ said Cilic.

‘I ended up using too much energy for that third set. Mentally, as well.’

Then came the new shoes, a bit of silence outside and, ultimately, the turnaround as Djokovic broke serve twice in each of the fourth and fifth sets.

At times he was brilliant, dominating the rallies and reading Cilic’s much-improved serve.

But the concern will be that he has not regularly reached the levels he is known for.

If there are any chinks in his armour it is likely Dimitrov will find them.

One to beat: Dimitrov is the form player on grass this Championships

Djokovic said of the Bulgarian: ‘The fact that he hasn’t lost a match in the grass court season this year says enough about his quality. Also winning against Andy on grass.

‘I’m sure many people look at him as a potential Grand Slam winner. Maybe here, maybe in the Grand Slams to follow. His game has improved a lot.

‘A new wave is able to challenge the best and contend for Grand Slam titles.’

With that, he was asked about those shoes. ‘I have to think about that,’ he said. ‘If they’re lucky, I’ll wear them.’
