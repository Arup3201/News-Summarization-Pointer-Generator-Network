Andy Murray’s Manila Mavericks fell to defeat in their opening contest of the first International Premier Tennis League.

The Scot is playing in the four parts series along with some of the top names in the game past and present, with the first round of fixtures played in the Philippines this weekend.

Maria Sharapova came back from 2-5 down in her clash with Kristina Mladenovic to win 6-5 before Murray faced US Open champions Marin Cilic in the final singles needing a 6-2 win to force a shootout.

Murray enjoyed teaming up with Sharapova in the mixed doubles during the inaugural round-robin International Premier Tennis League 

The four franchised teams will visit each other (although star names might not play in all the matches. For example Murray is only expected to play the first event in Manila) and the home team decides the order of play.

Matches are five sets and will involve a one set contest in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and men's legends singles. The winners are the team that gains the most games within five sets and not the winner of the most sets like usual in tennis.

If a set is tied at 5-5 then players play out a timed tie-break to decide the winner. In addition there are no advantage scores, meaning the winner of the point at deuce takes the game. 

A shot clock of 20 seconds is used in between points to keep the momentum of the matches quick and the change of ends only lasts a minute. 

The scoring system is rather labored: The winning team picks up four league points, the losing team receives two league points if they win 20 games, only one point if they win 10-19 games and gain no points for less than 9 games. The winning team pockets $1million each match.  

Murray and Sharapova lost 6-4 in their mixed doubles set against Nenad Zimonjic and Kristina Mladenovic 

MANILA MAVERICKS: Andy Murray, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Kirsten Flipkens, Maria Sharapova, Daniel Nestor, Carlos Moya, Treat Huey.

SINGAPORE SLAMMERS: Serena Williams, Andre Agassi, Tomas Berdych, Lleyton Hewitt, Daniela Hantuchova, Nick Kyrgios, Bruno Soares, Patrick Rafter.

MACROMAX INDIAN ACES: Roger Federer, Pete Sampras ,Gael Monfils, Ana Ivanovic, Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Fabrice Santoro.

UAE ROYALS: Novak Djokovic, Caroline Wozniacki, Malek Jaziri, Goran Ivanisevic, Nenad Zimonjic, Marin Cilic, Kristina Mladenovic. 

Murray surrendered an early break to Cilic to fall 2-1 behind but managed to respond to force a tie-break at 5-5 all.

Team coach and player Treat Huey said to Murray at the changeover 'you're all over him', as the Mavericks tried to stay in contention. 

However in the timed tie-break Cilic built a decisive lead to beat Murray and secure the UAE's victory 29-24. 

Earlier on Friday, the first team contest saw the Micromax Indian Aces beat the Singapore Slammers 26-16, with charismatic Frenchman Gael Monfils playing inspirational tennis.

Monfils defeated 2002 Wimbledon champions Lleyton Hewitt 6-1 after Ana Ivanovic had thrashed Daniela Hantuchova 6-0 to enable the Micromax Indian Aces to cruise to victory. 

30 players are included in the four franchise teams, including the likes of Roger Federer, Djokovic, Murray, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.

The tournament heads to Singapore second, before fans in India and the UAE are entertained through the first half of December.

Captains Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic did not play in the opening ties for their sides after winning the Davis Cup and Barclays ATP World Tour Finals respectively in the past fortnight.
