American airports have had security increased after al-Qaeda published instructions on how to make an 'undetectable' bomb to bring down passenger jets.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that the TSA will now begin searching more travelers, especially in wake of the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris.

While Johnson said that there was 'no specific, credible threat' of an imminent attack, recent calls by al-Qaeda and ISIS to attack Western civilians, police and soldiers left them with little choice but to urge on the side of caution.

The latest edition of al-Qaeda's English-language, online magazine, Inspire outlines how to make the bomb from household goods and without using metal components that would show up in airport security checks.

Al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), writes that it has spared 'no effort in simplifying the idea' so that every 'determined Muslim can prepare'.

The 'hidden bomb' instructions are contained in the latest edition of Inspire which features a civilian airliner on its cover.

'This group, AQAP, is absolutely determined… to try and [carry] out an attack on a U.S.-bound airplane,' said Matt Olsen, former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant.

Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year

'The prospect of AQAP trying to get a bomb on an airplane has been, for the past several years, at the top of the list for concerns of the U.S. counterterrorism community.'

The magazine tells readers how to make the device from 'simple materials that are readily available around the globe', then goes on to tell them whereabouts on a plane to detonate the device to cause maximum damage.

Charlie Hebdo magazine killers, Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, are thought to have travelled to Yemen to be trained by AQAP, where at least one of them met Anwar al-Awlaki, the group's former spiritual leader.

Awlaki, who was killed by U.S. forces in 2011, founded the quarterly published Inspire magazine, which has been linked to seven out of 10 terror plots against British targets since 2010, the Sunday Times reports.

In 2009, AQAP sent Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a graduate of University College London, on a mission to blow up a passenger jet over Detroit. He hid the bomb in his underwear, but it failed to detonate. Abdulmutallab was jailed for life in 2012.

The newspaper quoted an explosives expert who was sceptical the bomb AQAP was advising readers on how to build would evade detection. The expert wasn't sure how effective it would be either, saying it was more likely to burn rapidly, 'in the manner of a firework'.

In the same issue of the magazine the group called for a new generation of 'lone wolf' terrorists to blow up American Airlines, United and Delta planes using bombs made in their kitchens.

AQAP wrote that the high-profile airlines should be targeted in a bid to gain headlines and 'crush the enemy's economy'.

Released on Christmas Eve, the disturbing publication names the four companies because of their size - including United, the 'world's largest airline with 86,852 employees'.

Praised: The Boston bombings (left is suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) and 'underpants bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right) are both mentioned in the magazine, whose possession in the past has led to arrests 

Also targeted are Air France and British carriers British Airways and easyJet - alongside high-profile U.S. figures Bill Gates and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.

Continental Airlines is also singled out despite the fact that it stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United to form United Continental Holdings.

The latest edition has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide called Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.

The guide was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year's Boston Marathon bombings.
