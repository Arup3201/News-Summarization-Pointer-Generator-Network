A judge has shaved slices off the squabbling owners of a famous New York deli, claiming he couldn't care less about the couple who 'made millions of millions of dollars on the backs of dishwashers and cleaners and pastrami slicers' they allegedly underpaid.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper admonished Carnegie Deli owners Marian and Sandy Levine during their divorce proceedings Wednesday after Mrs Levine accused him of making light of pastrami puns at previous court dates.

According to The New York Daily News, he retorted, saying he '(couldn't) care less about both of these people, in a sense' and slammed them for wasting the court's time.

The Levines recently agreed to a $2.65 million settlement after they were accused of cheating workers out of wages for more than 10 years.

They are now divorcing after a 22-year marriage because Mr Levine allegedly had an affair with a former hostess at the deli.

Cooper recently ordered Mrs Levine, who inherited the business from her father, Milton Parker, to pay over $11,000 in alimony to her retired husband.

And on Wednesday he denied Marian Levine's motion to throw out this decision. According to the Daily News, she claims Mr Levine lied about his assets, stole shared money by forging her signature and purchased a $1 million home in Florida in his daughter's name to cut her out.

Cooper said in court that Mrs Levine's lawyers had accused him of making light of a joke made by Mr Levine's lawyer who referred to one of Mrs Levine's claims about alleged missing funds as being 'all smoked meat and mirrors.'

But Cooper said it was arrogant to suggest he spent that much time thinking about them.

'This is not a case where I lose sleep at night,' he said, according to the Daily News.

'This is not some case where I have people with disabled children, where I have people who can't afford to make next month's rent.'

However, Cooper later apologized if he did in fact offended anyone.

Mr Levine left swiftly after the hearing while Mrs Levine sobbed in the courtroom, according to the newspaper, before telling waiting reporters she would like to tell her story at a later date.

The Carnegie Deli, located at 854 7th Avenue adjacent to Carnagie Hall in Midtown, was opened in 1937 and is now in its third generation of owners.

The Parker family's delicatessen is among the most visited restaurants of its type in the city, according to the New York Convention & Visitors Bureau, and is often dubbed the most famous deli in America.

In April, a judge signed off on multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit filed by 25 current and former Carnegie Deli workers who said the owners had been cheating them out of wages for years.
