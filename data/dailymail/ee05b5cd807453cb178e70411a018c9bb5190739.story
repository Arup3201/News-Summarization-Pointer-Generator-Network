Kevin Signo, who died in a freak accident as he attempted a back-flip while rehearsing a dance with friends

A teenager died after a back-flip went horribly wrong during a break in rehearsals of a traditional dance routine.

Kevin Signo, an 18-year-old Baylor University freshman, died Sunday after a bizarre accident as he attempted the acrobatic move when he and his friends took a break from rehearsing traditional dances with the Filipino Students' Association.

The pre-biology student from Frisco, Texas, hit his forehead and suffered a fatal spinal injury, according to a justice of the peace who spoke to theÂ Waco Tribune-Herald.

His parents, Henry and Jackie Signo, told NBC their son was shy in high school but had thrived socially since arriving at Baylor, in Waco, Texas.

The Signos said Kevin dreamed of being a doctor and had signed legal documents to say he was an organ donor because he liked the idea that he could help others in the event of a tragedy.

He was an organ donor who had a legal document drawn up, donating his eyes, skin, bones and organs.

'He knew exactly what could be used for and what was important,' Mrs Signo said.

Mr Signo added: 'We're very happy to have had him for a short time.'

At least two busloads of students from Baylor are expected to make the trip to the funeral, which will take place on Saturday.

'Kevin was a very bright, well-liked 
and involved student on our campus,' said Baylor spokeswoman Lori 
Fogleman. 'He had so many friends here who will miss him terribly'.

His Facebook page said Kevin went to Frisco High School and was originally from Carol Stream in Illinois. His parents announced plans to provide a scholarship in his name at Baylor.
