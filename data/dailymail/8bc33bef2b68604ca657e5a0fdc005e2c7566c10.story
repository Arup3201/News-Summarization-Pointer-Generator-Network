A shockingly, gruesome new ad campaign has been launched to show the potentially fatal danger of distracted driving.

Using the slogan 'U Drive. U Text. U Pay', the $8.5million, government campaign will run across the U.S. from April 7 - 15. It will feature on TV, radio and in digital advertisements.

The ad shows a teenage girl at the wheel of a car using her phone and chatting to friends before suddenly a truck appears out of nowhere, smashes into the side of the vehicle and causes catastrophic damage.

The shocking new ad shows just how dangerous distracted driving can be as the two teenage girls are hit by a truck after the driver was texting at the wheel

The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 3,328 people were killed 
and an estimated 421,000 injured in distraction-related crashes in 2012.

Three-quarters of young people (71 per cent) have admitted to sending or writing text messages while driving while 78 per cent said they have read a message while driving.

According to research, five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting. When traveling at 55mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field blindfolded.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said: 'This campaign puts distracted driving on par with our efforts to fight drunk driving or to encourage seatbelt use.'

The new ads, which will run in English and Spanish, aim to bolster distracted driving demonstration programs in California and Delaware of high-visibility police enforcement and fines.

The efforts have reduced hand-held phone use over a widespread area.

The ad campaign, which features three young friends, will run across the U.S. this month in English and Spanish

The ad shows three teenage friends chatting and laughing in the car while playing music. As the car reaches a stop sign, the teenage driver looks down at her phone.

In the passenger window, a truck can be seen - but the car glides through the Stop sign before a horrifying, fatal collision is shown.

Currently, 43 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for drivers of all ages.

In 12 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands drivers of all ages are banned from using hand-held cell phones while driving. In 37 states and D.C., cell phone use by novice drivers is not allowed.
