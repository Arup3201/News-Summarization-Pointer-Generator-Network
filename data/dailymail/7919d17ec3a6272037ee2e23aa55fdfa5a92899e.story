Betting shops would be banned from opening in a town centres under Lib Dem plans to curb gambling.

Communities minister Don Foster wants to change the law so that every new bookmakers requires planning permission to set up business.

But he faces opposition from Tory colleagues in the coalition, who have moved to make it easier for betting shops to open.

Mr Foster will use next month’s Lib Dem conference in Glasgow to set out plans for new laws to halt the spread of betting shops, which have taken over in many deprived areas.

He will call for betting shops to be put in a new separate planning use class, allowing local councils to reject applications.

Labour’s controversial Gambling Act would also be amended to allow councils to take into account the ‘cumulative impact of a proliferation of gambling activities’ when considering applications.

Warning: Local government minister Don Foster wants to change the law to curb betting shops

In May new laws came into force allowing betting shops to open up in pubs without planning permission in what was dubbed a ‘free for all’ on Britain’s high streets.

The rules have been introduced for a two-year period to try to make it easier for people to fill empty shops or start new businesses without having to seek permission to change property from one use to another.

The Local Government Association has repeatedly called for more powers to curb the problem.

Bookmakers have swamped the UK's shopping parades – with numbers up 25 per cent since 2008 - and in one London borough, Newham, there are currently 82 - six per square mile.

Around almost every corner in this generally deprived part of East London are shops where people can stake £100 a spin on casino-style gambling machines, which are as addictive as crack cocaine

The liberalisation of gambling laws by the Labour government in 2005 is blamed for a surge in the number of betting shops.

At present betting shops are in the same planning use class as banks and building societies.

It means they can open without planning permission in many cases where banks have moved out.

There are also growing concerns about big money gambling machines found in many betting shops, where users can stake £100 a spin on a casino-style jackpot payout.

They account for more revenue than the traditional bets placed on sporting events.

A government review by TV retail guru Mary Portas describes gaming outlets as a ‘blight on the high

Street’, and warned their proliferation is creating unsightly gambling ‘clusters’ on struggling shopping streets.

Earlier this year Newham Council refused to allow a further betting shop in an already over-crowded street, but it was overturned on appeal.

Mr Foster will argue that local councillors ‘should be empowered to decide whether or not to give approval to additional gambling venues in their community’.
