The mother of two toddlers who drowned in a friend's pool while she slept inside was arrested yesterday after a four-month investigation in La Mesa, San Diego.

Tassie Behrens, 26, faces charges of felony child abuse, being under the influence of drugs and possession of marijuana for sale, and is expected to be booked into Las Colinas jail, UT San Diego reported.

The children, two-year-old Jason Bradford and his 16-month-old sister, Harley, were found floating in the pool of a La Mesa rental home on May 13.

The children's mother, Tassie Anne Behrens, 26, was asleep when her two toddlers ended up in the pool

Behrens told investigators her son 
Jason woke her up that morning at 8am to ask for his sister Harley, but
 she allegedly went back to sleep.

The mother then found both children floating face down at 9:45am and Harley was pronounced dead just before 10.30am.

Jason lived for another 13 hours before succumbing to his injuries.

Behrens and a male friend who lived at theÂ  house took the children to La Mesa Fire Station 13 (about 15 minutes away), where paramedics tried to revive the toddlers.

Firefighters at the station were 
unable to revive the toddlers, and they were rushed to Sharp Grossmont 
Hospital, where Harley was pronounced dead at 10.27am. Her brother was 
transferred to Rady Children's Hospital, where he died at 11.25pm.

Stressed: Behrens wrote on her Facebook page about her struggles of raising two young children on her own

Behrens
 later told detectives that the reason she did not call 911 but rather 
chose to drive her dying children to a fire station is because she did 
not want to get her friend in trouble for failing to install a fence 
around the pool, according to Lt. Glenn Giannantonio.

Sherrif's
 deputies later around 60 marijuana plants growing at the home and a 
resident Larry Dangelo, 44, was arrested on drug charges and suspicion 
of running the marijuana-growing operation out of the basement at the 
house.

The 26-year-old mother initially lied to officials by saying that the children were found in a pool in a Spring Valley mobile home park, but later admitted that they were discovered at the Le Mesa home.

At least 60 marijuana plants and drug-making equipment were seized by members of the regional Narcotics Task Force.

Court records obtained by the paper show Dangelo has a criminal record dating back to 2000, which included 18 charges ranging from forgery of documents to burglary.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree burglary and was sentenced to three years' probation after spending a years in jail.

The mother of the two children told authorities she had been asleep and woke up to find the two children unconscious in the pool

Detectives do not believe that Dangelo was the person who accompanied Behrens as she drove her children to the fire station.

Behrens' male friend lives in a trailer on the property surrounding the million-dollar Sunset Avenue rental home.

Posts on Behrens' Facebook page paint a portrait of a young woman who had been struggling with the responsibilities of raising two children on her own, especially while recovering from a broken ankle in April.

'This is so crazy chasing after 2 babies when I cannot even walk on my own,' she wrote April 13.

'At least I can take cast on and off.If anyone feels like helping me by giving me a break from chasing kids around feel free to message me.lol'

In a message posted a day earlier, the 26-year-old lamented that no one offered her a helping hand, and she has vowed to do 'absolutely everything' on her own.

'Its [sic]only me n[sic] my two babies. the loves of my life,' Behrens wrote.
