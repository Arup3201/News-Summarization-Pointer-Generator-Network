A University of North Carolina at Charlotte freshman has died after falling from the seventh floor of his dorm.

Joshua Helm, 18, was found Sunday morning around 9:30 a.m. by a resident assistant on a first-floor overhang of Moore Hall. University spokesman John Bland confirmed the student fell from the seventh floor, where students say Helm's room was.

It is unclear whether drugs, alcohol or suicide led Helm, of Durham, to his fall.

â€œThough the investigation is still underway, there appears to be no foul play involved in this incident,â€
