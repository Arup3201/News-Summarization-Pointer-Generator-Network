Mixed martial arts fighter, 'War Machine', whose real name is Jon Koppenhaver, has been arrested on suspicion of beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she thought she might die

The 32-year-old fighter was captured in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley on Friday, August 15

The MMA fighter is accused of beating his ex-girlfriend Christy Macky so badly on August 8 that she told police in Las Vegas she thought she might die. 

Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping.

She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. 

Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. 

According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. 

Ms Mack, an adult film actor, said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife.

She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife.

She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego.

'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me.

'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 

'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.'

Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. 

She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side.

'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 

Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver

'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife.

'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 

'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.'

Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her.

'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. 

'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.'

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife.

'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 

'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.'

Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past.

Mack said in an online statement: 'I have no recollection of how many times I was hit'

After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt.

A hotel guest told KTLA-TV in Los Angeles that she summoned police to the hotel after seeing a large man yelling, pushing and grabbing the hair of a woman who was trying to calm him down.

He was eventually captured by police in Simi Valley on August 15. 

Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver. If convicted, it could land him in prison for more than 25 years. 

The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007.

He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year.

He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.
