Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic remain on course for a domestic treble having defeated ten-men Dundee United 2-0 in the League Cup final.

Kris Commons and James Forrest fired in the goals to beat Dundee United, who had captain Sean Dillon sent off to compound their misery.

Find out how each player performed at Hampden Park...

Dundee United's captain Sean Dillon is sent off by referee Bobby Madden for a tackle on Emilio Izaguirre

DUNDEE UNITED

RADOSLAW CIERZNIAK 6

Clawed away Commons initial effort but unable to reach rebound. Not a prayer as Forrest settled the issue but saved penalty.

SEAN DILLON 5

Will curse fact he was off injured as Celtic scored but could have no complaints as red was produced for lunge on Izaguirre.

JAROSLAW FOJUT 6

A helpless bystander as Commons struck. Won vast majority of long balls Celtic threw into his area.

CALLUM MORRIS 6

Was relieved to see Griffiths fire into side-net after short back-pass. Will take pride in keeping Griffiths quiet.

Paul Dixon of Dundee United (left) struggled to cope with the pace of Celtic's James Forrest (right)

PAUL DIXON 6

Spurned decent free-kick chance but corners hit their intended spots. Conceded penalty which was saved.

RYAN MCGOWAN 6

Started on right midfield was repeatedly pressed back by Stokes. Booked for scything Brown down.

PAUL PATON 6

His industry and anticipation were the main reasons Celtic couldn’t play through United. Subbed.

JOHN RANKIN 6

Gordon smothered his effort with the game goal-less. Unable to affect the game from his station on the left of midfield.

CALUM BUTCHER 6

Stayed touch-tight in midfield to Brown which ensured the Celtic skipper didn’t get the run of the game.

Jackie McNamara (centre) and his Dundee United players are clearly gutted after the League Cup final loss

RYAN DOW 6

Hit the turf upon being nudged by Brown but probably a little too easily for Bobby Madden’s liking. Tireless shift.

MARIO BILATE 5

Asked to fill Ciftci’s boots and struggled initially. Tested Gordon with stinging drive but subbed before the hour mark.

THE MANAGER 5

Irate that Dow didn’t win penalty but, on reflection, Jackie McNamara will concede Dillon pulled the rug from beneath him.

SUBS

Anier (Bilate, 59) Erskine (Paton, 72).

CELTIC

CRAIG GORDON 7

Alert to deny Rankin then fielded Bilate’s deflected drive. Precious little to do once United were a man light.

EFE AMBROSE 7

Defensively sound and provided additional width with his frequent adventures up the right. Couple of terrific passes into the final third.

JASON DENAYER 7

Deila was grateful for his blistering recovery pace on more than one occasion. Won his individual battle with Bilate with something to spare.

Kris Commons put The Bhoys ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions 

VIRGIL VAN DIJK 7

Almost opened the scoring with looping header and took the minimal attacking threat of United in his stride.

EMILIO IZAGUIRRE 7

Fortunate to escape booking for upending Dow then found himself on receiving end of Dillon’s reckless lunge.

NIR BITTON 7

Couple of heat-seeking passes from deep deserved better. Jarred his knee and made way for Henderson.

Celtic captain Scott Brown used all his experience to guide Celtic to victory at Hampden Park on Sunday

SCOTT BROWN 7

Anxious moment as Dow went down from his nudge. Sluggish start to the game but relished the task of dragging his side over the line.

KRIS COMMONS 7

Kept his composure to fire his side ahead at the second attempt. A goal that justifies the new contract in itself.

STEFAN JOHANSEN 8

Herculean work-rate is now taken as read but the Norwegian’s game intelligence is now a standard feature of every Celtic performance.

Stefan Johansen (left), was in fine form on Sunday, clashed with Dundee United's Ryan Dow 

ANTHONY STOKES 8

Lively and effective down the left. A day of redemption after failing to trap for the Inter match.

LEIGH GRIFFITHS 6

Uncertain touch and runs that went rewarded added up to a frustrating day for the striker. Made way for Guidetti.

THE MANAGER 8

A deserved triumph for Deila. Now has the chance to follow Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill by winning the Treble.

SUBS

Forrest (Commons, 69) Guidetti (Griffiths, 69) Henderson (Bitton, 81).
