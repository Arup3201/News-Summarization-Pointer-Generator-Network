Robin van Persie has been afforded three weeks off by Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and won't join the squad on their trip to America.

The Holland striker revealed that he was in need of a break after the Dutch finished third at this summer's World Cup, with the news coming in direct contrast to Wayne Rooney's treatment, who was made to cut his holiday short in order to join the pre-season camp.

Van Persie missed eight games towards the end of last season for United and was running on near empty during Saturday night's win against Brazil.

That's me on holiday, lads! Robin van Persie has been given three weeks off at the end of the World Cup

Not in the USA: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal decided to give his talisman the time off

The striker played 548 minutes through the tournament and Van Gaal feels he requires an extended rest in order to be fully fit and firing before the start of the new Premier League season.

'I need that,' Van Persie said. 'It was a tough tournament. Every match I gave it my all. That was just it, more wasn't possible.'

While the difference in treatment for Rooney, his England team-mates and Van Persie comes as Van Gaal's first potentially controversial decision in charge at United, it also appears to be a correct one. Van Persie missed 27 games for United last season and the consensus is that he could do with an extended rest.

That wasn't something afforded at the World Cup. The 30-year-old scored four goals, including a stunning header against Spain in the opening game, and was the focal point spearheading the attack for his boss.

They enjoy a close friendship, with Van Persie expected to be handed the captaincy ahead of Rooney at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal was full of praise for his talisman as the Dutch landed home at the weekend. 'If you know where he came from and what he's done, all you can do is compliment him,' the 62-year-old enthused.

Van Gaal himself has insisted he doesn't need any time off and can't wait to get started at Carrington.

‘I don’t need a holiday,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s great to have such an exciting challenge. To work daily with young people is something I don’t need time off to rest for.

'I’ve only met two people from the daily management, the chief scout and the chief executive officer. And two of the owners.'

'It’s time I got to know more people. I will do my best. Whether that’s enough for the fans, I will wait and see, but I hope that will be the case.'
