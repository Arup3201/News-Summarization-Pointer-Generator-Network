One of the policewomen murdered in cold blood may have made a desperate attempt to Taser their killer moments before they were gunned down, it emerged last night.

A 50,000-volt stun gun was found on the ground at the scene of Tuesday’s bloodbath and detectives are trying to establish if either PC Fiona Bone or PC Nicola Hughes tried to discharge it.

The non-lethal weapon was out of its holster, prompting speculation that one of them had grabbed it before being killed in the gun and grenade attack.

Such was the speed and ferocity of the ambush, officers doubt that the pair had any chance to defend themselves.

The officers were lured to their deaths after being called out to investigate what turned out to be a bogus report of a burglary, leaving them at the mercy of a murderous police-hater.

The Taser – which fires barbed darts with copper cables attached which paralyse suspects for a short time – is a key line of inquiry as investigators try to establish exactly what happened.

The twist emerged as:

Greater Manchester Police confirmed they had found a Taser which was being carried by one of the officers at the crime scene in Hattersley, Greater Manchester.

A senior source said: ‘It may well be that one of these officers bravely tried to tackle the gunman with the Taser.

Shock: Members of the public hug each other as they lay tributes to Pc Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone

Tributes: Two men bring flowers to the spot closest to where PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone were killed

Support: Officers help a man in a wheelchair bringing flowers to the scene where the two policewomen died

‘It was found lying on the ground out of its holster and we are trying to ascertain whether it had been discharged or not.’

A 28-year-old man was yesterday arrested in Hattersley on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

Cregan, 29, is also being questioned over the officers’ deaths and the killings of father and son David and Mark Short earlier this year.

He handed himself into police a short while after Tuesday’s murders.

A desk officer at a local police station kept him talking while an armed unit was scrambled to the scene and he was arrested.

Police were today granted more time to question Cregan.

Greater Manchester Police chief Sir Peter said officers remain under threat after the deaths of the two policewomen.

He said he could not be sure all the explosive devices had been recovered from the area where they were attacked.

‘We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there,’ he said.

Investigation: Police forensics staff work near the scene in Greater Manchester where two unarmed female police officers were killed in a gun and grenade attack, which led to the arrest of a wanted man

‘I would want that to be the message. This has been a long-standing criminal feud between different outfits in Manchester and in the Tameside area (of Greater Manchester).’ 

He said that the force had issued Osman warnings – notices given to people under threat of being murdered or seriously injured – to ‘a large number of individuals’. Sources denied children were among them.

Sir Peter reiterated that the force had no prior intelligence about the address in Abbey Gardens where PCs Bone and Hughes were sent to investigate a bogus report of  a burglary. There was nothing to indicate a greater than normal threat, he said.

'We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there'

Sir Peter Fahy, Greater Manchester Police chief

The chief constable confirmed that Cregan was on bail over a fatal pub shooting at the time of Tuesday’s double murder.

Mark Short, 23, was shot dead at the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, on May 25. In June, Cregan was arrested in connection with this death and released on bail.

Sir Peter said there had been insufficient evidence to charge Cregan over the death and he had to be released.

He added: We often get to a point where there is not enough evidence to justify a charge and therefore a person has to be released under the time limits set by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

‘That is what happened in this particular murder which led to Cregan and others being bailed while further inquiries were made on a large number of fronts until we reached a position where there was enough evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service to authorise a charge for murder.’

The post mortem examination for both officers has concluded that they died as a result of gunshot wounds.

It had not been known initially if shrapnel from the grenade had played a part in their deaths.
