Oxford student Charlotte Coursier committed suicide six hours after her boyfriend ended their relationship

A 'talented and gifted' Oxford University student hanged herself after her boyfriend of 11 months ended their relationship.

Charlotte Coursier was struggling to cope with a 'campaign of harassment' inflicted on her by a college lecturer, as well as the torment of having aborted a pregnancy.

An inquest heard how Miss Coursier was found dead at home by her housemates in June last year.

The coroner was told she had been bombarded with 'crazy and rambling' emails sent by Dr Jeffrey Ketland, a former college lecturer, who followed her to Oxford when she moved from Edinburgh.

He harassed the 25-year-old after the pair had a sexual relationship, claiming he saved Miss Coursier's life after she overdosed while they were both at Edinburgh University, the inquest heard.

Miss Coursier left the Scottish university to study a post-graduate course in philosophy at St Edmund Hall College in Oxford in October 2012.

Dr Ketland had also moved to the city, securing a lecturing post at one of the colleges in Oxford, the coroner was told.

Three months prior to moving to Oxford, Miss Coursier had started seeing Ben Fardell, from London.

A statement by Mr Fardell, read to the inquest, revealed he had recently come out of another relationship when he started dating Miss Coursier.

The statement said: 'In the first six months there were 
issues of trust and commitment in the relationship.

'But
 Charlotte was much better in the new year. Then, in February, 
she discovered she was seven weeks pregnant despite taking 
contraception.'

Mr Fardell told his girlfriend that he was not ready to be a father and supported her as she came to the 'incredibly difficult' decision to terminate the pregnancy.

After cancelling her first appointment, Miss Coursier's abortion was carried out on March 25 - something she later described as 'murdering her child'.

'She was very low for 
weeks after this and she found it very difficult to get over having 
murdered her child, as she put it,' said Mr Fardell.

'Although she stopped mentioning it after a while I'm not sure she ever got over it.'

Nicholas Graham, assistant coroner 
for Oxfordshire, heard that while at Edinburgh University, Miss Coursier had started a sexual relationship with lecturer Dr 
Ketland.

After the relationship ended and she graduated, Dr Ketland also moved to Oxford to start working at Pembroke College - after holding another post elsewhere.

Miss Coursier told Mr Fardell she had contacted Dr Ketland in a friendly manner ahead of going to Oxford and he responded to her in a way that began politely but quickly descended into crazy, rambling accusations.

Ms Coursier then shared her concerns with Mr Fardell and showed him the emails she had exchanged with Dr Ketland.

'He thought he saved her life in Edinburgh and in doing so, he managed to destroy his own,' Mr Fardell said.

'She
 went to see him in a professional capacity to seek help and advice. His
 abuse of her made an already fragile girl even worse.

'She found the whole thing very distressing and disheartening and thought nobody would believe her and that they would take Jeffrey's side.'

Miss Coursier reported Dr Ketland to Thames Valley Police on May 19, and raised the issue with the student advisory services at the university.

Dr Ketland was issued a warning by police officers, under the Harassment Act.

Mr Fardell said he felt the 
relationship was holding both he and Miss Coursier back, and after 
considering what to do for several weeks, he decided to break up with 
her.

On June 10, after spending the weekend together in London, Mr Fardell told the 25-year-old he wanted to end their relationship.

'Charlotte
 pleaded with me not to break up with her and she talked about how hard 
she had been trying to make things better,' he said.

'She was crying and told me "I don't want to live without you".'

After parting ways at 11.45am, Miss Coursier sent two text messages to Mr Fardell and tried to call him three times.

He was unable to answer the calls as he was on the train, the inquest was told.

Miss Coursier's housemates did not see her arrive home but at 9pm found her phone ringing on the sofa. The house phone rang shortly afterwards.

Miss Coursier's housemate Brooke Berndtson answered the call, which was from Mr Fardell.

She went to the 25-year-old's room, but discovered her body slumped against the wall, lifeless.

Fellow housemate Yuukki Ohta rushed 
to help and called 999. Despite attempts to revive the philosophy 
student, Miss Coursier was pronounced dead at her home shortly after 
10pm.

Detective Sergeant Rhian Evans said police discovered no suicide note.

A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as hanging.

Mr
 Fardell said: 'I can't help but feel my breaking up with her was the 
tipping point but I understand I am not responsible for her death.

'I deeply regret not picking up the phone when she called. I wish she would have waited for me, I would have come to Oxford.'

Assistant coroner, Mr Graham read a statement from Professor Keith Gull, principal of St Edmund Hall, describing Miss Coursier as a 'rising star' and citing references from Edinburgh University lecturers which ranked her in the top five of all undergraduate students they had taught.

'Many thought she was the most gifted philosophy student in her year,' said Professor Gull.

'She was a delight to have in the faculty and is a great loss to us all.'

Charlotte's mother, Margaret Marklew from Birmingham, and brother Henry sobbed as Mr Graham recorded a verdict of suicide.

Dr Ketland has asked us to make clear that he was not asked to give evidence at the inquest and he denies the allegations Ms Coursier made about this conduct. He moved to Oxford before she did and had contacted the authorities over his concern about her mental state.
