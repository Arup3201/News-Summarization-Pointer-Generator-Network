‘We were expecting a little wedding in the corner,’ Meinhardt said. ‘This is definitely more than we could have ever asked for.’

The couple, who met at Chester High School in Northern California, initially planned to marry in October but had to postpone the wedding when Ruffer's deployment was extended, according to KOLO-TV.

The bride had inquired about an airport wedding about three weeks earlier, saying Ruffer wanted to get married the moment he laid eyes on her after returning from his Navy assignment.

'Dylan said he wanted to marry me the moment he set eyes on me, so I wondered if we could get married in the airport,' Meinhardt told

Businesses and community members rallied
after hearing about the plan. The Peppermill casino offered a spa 
package so the bride could prepare, while the Eldorado casino donated a 
honeymoon suite and limousine.

The airport catering service prepared food for the reception in a fully decorated section of the baggage claim area and featured a DJ.

‘A lot of people were absolutely stunned to see a wedding in the terminal,’ airport spokesman Brian Kulpin said. ‘It's not something you see in the airport every day.’

Dylan's family says they were overwhelmed by the of, not only of Dylan and Madison, but the entire community.

'I think our heart just all went out to them.' said James Ruffer, Dylan's grandfather, 'To see them so much in love and knowing that we had something very special planned for them.'

The Ruffer family says Madison will join Dylan to start their lives together in Virginia, some time next month.
