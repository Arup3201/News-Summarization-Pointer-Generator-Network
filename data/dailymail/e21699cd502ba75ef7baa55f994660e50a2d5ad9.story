Authorities are looking for three Asian men suspected of gang raping and beating a University of California, Santa Barbara student.

The 19-year-old woman was attacked by several men sometime between 11pm Saturday and 4am Sunday, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said.

The student was not sure where the attack happened, but it was either on the school's campus or in the neighboring community of Isla Vista, Hoover said.

Scene of the crime: The student said the attack happened somewhere between the UCSB campus and Isla Vista

Sheriff's deputies and UCSB police were searching the campus Sunday, trying to determine where the alleged crime took place.

'The group acted together to commit the crime,' the spokeswoman said.

The woman was able to return to her residence and tell her roommate. She was then taken to a local hospital for treatment.

There were no known witnesses, and the woman's name was not being released.

'We have two really big challenges in this case: there were no witnesses that we know of, and we donâ€™t have much detail as to the description of the suspects,' Hoover told KTLA.

'Right now, what we have to go on is that the suspects are described as Asian males. Obviously this is a lot for the victim to go through, so we are working with her to try and get a better description and to find who did this,' Hoover added to CBS Los Angeles.

On Sunday, sheriff's deputies and UC Santa Barbara police appealed for the public's help.

'It's a very active investigation,' Hoover said.

The Santa Barbara News-Press reported that another woman was sexually assaulted in Isla Vista early Saturday. Authorities said the assailant met the woman outside a party and took her behind a car, where he assaulted her. He remained at large.

Hoover said investigators didn't know whether the crimes are related.

The string of recent sex assaults has led many women on campus to fear for their safety.

'There have been many, many things that have happened in Isla Vista in general so I think that the police doing the IV foot patrol helps out but its not enough,' UCSB graduate Julia Gellar said.
