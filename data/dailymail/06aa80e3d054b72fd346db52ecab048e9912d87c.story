America has made significant progress in race relations since the Civil Rights Act was signed 50 years ago, Attorney General Eric Holder said today, but 'our work is not complete.'

'As it stands our society is not yet color blind nor should it be given the disparities that still afflict and divide us,' he said this morning at a Department of Justice event commemorating the signing of the 1964 legislation.

'We must be color brave and must never forget that all our made better and more prosperous if all are given equal opportunities.'

'We must be color brave': Attorney General Eric Holder said today that America has made significant progress since the Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964, but 'too many' Americans still face discrimination in society

'And we must never hesitate to confront the fact that... in too many places' in America ' the echos of injustices stretching
 back nearly four centuries continue to reverberate,' Holder continued. 'These echos from 
times past are still heard by too many in our nation today.'

The landmark civil rights legislation banned discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and color, but 'too many' women and minorities, as well as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender individuals, still face discrimination, Holder, the nation's first black Attorney General, told attendees of today's ceremony.

And if their problems 'were felt so acutely by the majority of Americans, I believe our national dialogue and the response to these problems could be very different,' he said.

Holder called on Congress to 'renew the spirit' of the Civil Right Act by passing Democrats' equal pay for equal work legislation and making reforms to fair housing and lending laws that allow for discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status.

Furthermore, Congress should pass legislation that guarantees non-discriminatory learning environments for LGBT individuals and make updates to to the Voting Rights Act, he said.

‘As a people we have never been content to tie ourselves to an unjust 
status quo' no matter how many other people in society are 'content' to do so, he said in encouraging Congress to pass his suggested reforms.

The Justice Department official touted his own department's efforts to prevent Republican-backed voter identification laws 'leveled under the dubious guise of voter fraud prevention' from taking effect.

Holder and other Democrats claim the laws are unfair to young people, the elderly and minorities, and violate voting rights.

The Obama administration has made 'sweeping' changes to ensure that all Americans receive equal protection under the law, Holder said, but the government can't end discrimination in America all on it's own. Americans must take it upon themselves to stop discriminatory behavior.

As a society, ‘we must be willing to acknowledge the problems that we face and to talk frankly about inequality,' he said, if we are to 'ultimately eradicate it.'

'And we must look at our great nation and reflect on its history with 
clarity and with painful honesty, with open eyes and deep understanding
 of who we have been, who we aspire to be and who we are today.'

President Lyndon B. Johnson shakes the hand of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the July 2, 1964 signing of the Civil Rights Act. Government officials memorialized for the signing of the bill today in Washington, D.C. at historically black college Howard University

The Justice Department held today's even memorializing the July 2, 1964 legislation in tandem with historically black college Howard University, which is located a few miles up the road from the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also gave remarks in addition to other Justice officials and Howard University representatives.

Holder, who gave the keynote address today, has been the Obama administration's official spokesman on racial issues throughout the last five and a half years, often saying what President Barack Obama - who did not speak at the event - is unwilling or unable to say for political reasons.

In a 2009 speech, Holder ruffled feathers by saying that  'in 
things racial,' Americans 'have always been and continue to be, in too 
many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.'

Holder stood by his remarks in an interview over the weekend, telling ABC News' Pierre Thomas, 'I
 think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial 
issues and to engage 'one another across the color line [to] 
talk about racial issues.'

In the interview, Holder previewed his remarks today, saying the country has 'made a great deal of progress' since the Civil Rights Act was passed, 'but
 there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the 
place that is consistent with our founding ideals.'
