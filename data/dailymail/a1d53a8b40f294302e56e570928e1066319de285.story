A bungling cat burglar fleeing the scene of a break-in was caught on camera falling head first out of an upstairs window.

Stuart Marsden, 48, had shimmied up a drainpipe to clamber through a sash window in the hope of grabbing valuables from a pensioner's upstairs bedroom.

But he was forced to flee empty handed when he was disturbed by a relative of the 85-year old householder who had family over for tea.

Watch the CCTV below

Bungling burglar: Stuart Marsden, 48, fell out the window during the burglary in Blackburn

As he tried to make his escape after being disturbed, Marsden slipped as he was grabbed by the legs and fell 15feet - landing on his head as he tumbled from the terraced property.

He was caught on CCTV footage falling to the ground before he got to his feet and limped away from the scene.

Despite making his getaway, he was arrested after police recovered DNA from a woolly hat he dropped at the scene.

Amazingly it was the second time Marsden had survived a fall during a bungled cat burglary. In 2010 he suffered a fractured pelvis, ankle and wrist when he jumped from the first floor window of the home of another pensioner.

Today Lancashire Police issued CCTV of
the raid after career criminal Marsden, from Blackburn, was jailed for 
28 months. He pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal.

Preston
Crown Court was told the raid occurred in March after Marsden walked 
past the victim's house in Blackburn and noticed an upstairs window was 
open.

Assuming the property 
was empty, he clambered up the drainpipe unaware 85-year-old Jean West 
was in the lounge downstairs with her daughter, son-in-law and grandson.

Son-in-law
Neil Morrison, 38, from Edinburgh, heard Marsden climbing up the 
drainpipe and went outside to investigate - only to see the intruder's 
legs disappearing through the upstairs window.

Mr Morrison then ran upstairs and made a grab for Marsden and a struggle broke out out.

He tried to stop the intruder climbing back out of the window only to be kicked repeatedly in the face.

But as Marsden broke free he slipped and fell head first onto a porch roof, before landing on the ground below. He was arrested the following month.

He claimed he had carried out the burglary in a bid to get money to pay for a deposit on a flat, and to pay for flights to Spain so he could look for work.

At Preston Crown Court Marsden, who has 67 previous convictions including 12 for burglary, asked for two similar offences to be taken into consideration.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne told him: 'Your recording of offending is appalling.'

Fall: Marsden topples off the sloping roof and onto the floor. In total he fell around 15ft

Getaway: Marsden is seen limping away down the street. Although police didn't catch him immediately, he left his hat at the scene and was caught by his DNA

After the case, Mrs West, a widow who has five children and eight grandchildren, said: 'I am just really surprised he survived that fall going out of that window head first like that. It is a real drop but he got what he deserved preying on an old lady like that.

'I'm just glad I had family round at the time because if I had been on my own I think the shock of him being in the house would have killed me.

'We heard a noise. My son-in-law went to check it out and came running back inside saying he had seen a man climbing into my bedroom window.

'Neil ran upstairs and switched on the light as the man dived onto the floor to try and hide between the wardrobe and the bed.'

Flee: Marsden thought the property was empty - and didn't realise the 85-year-old woman was in with her family at the time

She added: 'This is the second time I have been burgled. The first time was about two years ago when a man sneaked into my house at tea time and hid under the stairs for hours.

'When I went to bed around midnight it just felt like something was wrong, so I kept getting up. Around 3am the man popped out from under my bed, apologised and ran off.

'That was horrific, especially thinking about what could have happened. To be targeted again is horrible.'

Detective Inspector Paul Langley, from Lancashire Police said: 'This CCTV footage shows the lengths opportunist thieves will go to. If they see an open window or door, they will take their chances and, in Marsden's case, risk life and limb to get into your home.

'I hope people are reassured that Marsden is now off the streets and behind bars for a considerable amount of time.

'At the same time, I hope this acts as a warning to residents to make sure they lock their doors and windows before they go out and before they go to bed.'

In the previous burglary in Bolton, Greater Manchester in August 2010, Marsden was disturbed by a neighbour of his 76-year old victim after he clambered up a drainpipe to steal her handbag.

He assumed the house was empty and leapt out of a landing window to escape only to be seriously injured in the fall. He later appeared in court on crutches after undergoing surgery and was jailed for 16 months.
