Kate, who is five months pregnant, wore a black UK Scouting hooded top with black skinny J Brand jeans and boots as she helped eager youngsters to ice a cake blindfold.

Kate worked as a volunteer for the Scout Association when she and Prince William lived in Anglesey, North Wales, and looked delighted to be helping children at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony earn a new badge.

Scouting for royals: The Duchess of Cambridge exchanged high end fashion for a hoodie as she helped out a Beaver Scout colony tonight, teaching the eager youngsters at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony to ice a cake blindfold

Woman in black: Kate, who is five months pregnant, wore a black UK Scouting hooded top with black skinny J Brand jeans and boots as she helped the children earn their disability awareness badge

It promised to be a messy evening as the Duchess helped the Beavers, aged between five and eight, learn about life with disabilities.

As well as teaching the children to ice a cake, Kate  cut up a chocolate bar with boxing gloves, learned the Scout Promise in sign language, and helped children put a wet suit on blindfolded, supported by two-times world para triathlon champion Steve Judge.

In return, the children  earned a disability awareness badge.

The Duchess went to the meeting at Old Ford Primary School in Bow in the East End to highlight the Scout Association’s new campaign, Better Prepared, designed to bring Scouting to 200 of the most deprived parts of the country.

Good cause: The Duchess of Cambridge learns sign language as she meets one young girl at the newly established  Scout colony. Her visit was in support of the Scout Association's 'Better Prepared' campaign – a project designed to reach 200 of the most deprived areas in the country

Shown the ropes: Kate was shown around by Carlos Lopez-Plandolit (centre), the Beaver Scout colony leader, who became a volunteer about a year ago after coming to Britain five years ago from Spain to work for a technology company 

Jam packed evening: As well as teaching the children to ice a cake and learn the Scout promise in sign language, Kate was due to help the children to cut up a chocolate bar with boxing gloves and put a wet suit on blindfolded

Royal seal of approval: The Duchess gives a thumbs up sign to one young Scout after she masters the promise in sign language

But the movement, which has 446,000 youth members and already works in 70 of the 100 most deprived parts of the UK, will need to recruit 1,000 more adult volunteers to make it happen in those 200 areas. 

Across the country, Scouting needs 16,000 more adult volunteers to ensure that it can give the 40,000 young people on its waiting lists a place. 

The Beaver Scout colony in Poplar and Bow was launched last year. Wayne Bulpitt, UK Chief Commissioner of The Scout Association, said: 'We’re delighted that the Duchess has been able to help us celebrate the launch of Better Prepared – a project designed to reach 200 of the most deprived areas in the country, so all young people can access life-changing, everyday adventure. 

Task master: Kate looks concerned as she is handed a red boxing glove for her next assignment at the meeting

Getting to grips: Kate attempts simple tasks, such as chopping up a chocolate bar while wearing a pair of boxing gloves

Getting the giggles: Kate got stuck in to the activities, laughing as she joined a group of Beavers trying to cut up and eat Mars Bars using boxing gloves to simulate those with mobility or coordination problems

Reaching out: The Duchess tries to grab a plastic fork while wearing her boxing glove, to the amusement of Scout leader Mr Lopez-Plandolit

Familiar: Kate worked as a volunteer for the Scout Association when she and Prince William lived in Anglesey, North Wales, and looked delighted to be helping children at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony win a new badge

One of the gang: The Duchess was quickly given a UK Scouts scarf of the 23rd Poplar group tied in a friendship knot and got down to activities with the children

'The Duchess has seen at first-hand how Scouting helps young people develop, during her time as a volunteer in North Wales.'

He added: 'Where else, for £1.50 a week, can young people develop skills such as leadership, organisation, drive, loyalty, commitment, passion and compassion, and self-confidence? These are the attributes that young people need in order to get ahead in life. 

'As we look for 1,000 adult volunteers to help us launch 200 new Scout groups, we are working to make it as easy as possible for adults to fit volunteering in around their busy lives – this is how we change our society: with many people doing a little bit.'

A bite to eat: Kate also had a go at eating a bit of chocolate bar using chopsticks. 'No pressure,' the Duchess muttered to herself, as the cameras were trained on her

Helping hand: Kate teaches the young girl how to use the chopsticks to pick up sweets during one activity

Proud: The little girl manages to eat a fizzy lace with her chopsticks, thanks to the help of the Duchess who is clearly pleased with her efforts

Surprise visitor: The children had not been told beforehand that the Duchess was coming and when she arrived, one older Scout shouted out: 'Oh my God, it's Princess Kate'

Kate was shown around by Carlos Lopez-Plandolit, the Beaver Scout colony leader, who became a volunteer about a year ago after coming to Britain five years ago from Spain to work for a technology company. 

'It's the most exciting thing that happened to me in five years,' said Carlos, 31. 

'Scout groups like the one that the Duchess is visiting this evening give young people access to some fantastic opportunities that they might not have access to otherwise. 

Under instruction: Kate helped guide the hands of Fynley Gooch, 7, as he sat with a neckerchief covering his face and tried to squeeze icing over a fairy cake

Offering support: The Duchess holds the chocolate cake still so the young boy can decorate the treat without making a mess

No peeking! Kate laughs as she lifts the Scout's blindfold to make sure he is not peeking as he tries to ice the chocolate cake

'As someone who had never considered volunteering with The Scout Association until recently, I can’t recommend it enough.

'It’s a brilliant experience for those who love adventure and working with young people. Being a volunteer changed my life and I am proud I can change the life of the young people in the community in which I live and work.'

The children had not been told beforehand that the Duchess was coming and when she arrived, one older Scout shouted out: 'Oh my God, it's Princess Kate.' 

She was quickly given a UK Scouts scarf of the 23rd Poplar group tied in a friendship knot and got down to activities with the children, practising learning how to use sign language to say the Scout Promise. 

The Duchess helped one group of children put on blindfolds to simulate blindness but did not have a go herself at that stage.

At the next table, however, she certainly got stuck in, joining a group of Beavers trying to cut up and eat Mars Bars using boxing gloves to simulate those with mobility or coordination problems.

Taking part: At the final table, Kate sat with a group of children trying to put icing on some fairy cakes while blindfolded. She used her Scout scarf to cover her face and show the children what they needed to do

Changing places: After finishing Fynley's cake, Kate had a go at being blindfolded and he took his turn to guide her in decorating the cake

She also had a go at eating a bit of chocolate bar using chopsticks. 'No pressure,' the Duchess muttered to herself, as the cameras were trained on her.

At the final table, Kate sat with a group of children trying to put icing on some fairy cakes while blindfolded. She used her Scout scarf to cover her face and show the children what they needed to do.

She took her blindfold off and helped guide the hands of Fynley Gooch, 7, as he sat with a neckerchief covering his face and tried to squeeze icing over a fairy cake.

It was getting increasingly messy and chaotic on her table, as the blindfolded boy sitting on her other side, Kai Benjamin, 8, flapped his hands around trying to find a cake.

Pleased with her handiwork: Kate lifts her blindfold, after Fynley helped her to ice the cake and seems impressed with her efforts

Follow my lead: Kate had used her Scout scarf to cover her face and show the children what they needed to do

Rewarded for their efforts: When she had completed her cake decorating, Kate joined the 20 Beavers sitting in a circle and then, when everyone stood up, went around the circle, presenting each with a disability awareness badge

After finishing Fynley's cake, Kate had a go at being blindfolded and he took his turn to guide her in decorating the cake.

Fynley turned out to be not as patient as Kate, however, and at one stage walked off.

Carlos, the Beavers' leader spotted him making a break for it. 'It's OK, he's here,' he said, returning Fynley to the Duchess. 'Can you tell me please when he walks away,' Kate said, giggling.

When she had completed her cake decorating, Kate joined the 20 Beavers sitting in a circle and then, when everyone stood up, went around the circle, presenting each with a disability awareness badge. 'Well done,' she told each Beaver. 'Oh my gosh, look at all your badges,' she said to one. 'How many? Have you been counting them?'

Then Kate joined all the Beavers in using sign language to say the Scout's Promise - 'I promise to do my best, to be kind and helpful and to love my world' - before singing along to their farewell song 'Goodnight Beavers'.

After she had left, Carlos said: 'It was amazing. She's really spontaneous. She's naturally gifted with children. I think she had a great time.'
