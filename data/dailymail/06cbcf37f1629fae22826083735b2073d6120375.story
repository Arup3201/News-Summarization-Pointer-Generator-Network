Authorities have found eleven mutilated corpses,
many of them decapitated and burnt dumped by the roadside in
southwest Mexico.

The gruesome discovery was made on Thursday in the same state where 43 trainee
teachers were abducted and apparently massacred two months ago,
local authorities said.

A law enforcement official said the bodies were found near the city of Chilapa, an area that is known for gang violence and plantations of opium poppies.

The area is not far from the rural teachers' college known as Ayotzinapa, 43 of whose students disappeared in September and are believed to have been killed by a drug gang. 

The grisly discovery came just hours before embattled
President Enrique Pena Nieto was set to announce a series of
measures to improve law and order in a land grappling with daily
 drug gang violence.

Some of the naked torsos of the corpses were burnt,
photographs published by local media showed.

Nieto took office two years ago vowing to restore order
in Mexico, where about 100,000 people have died in violence
linked to organized crime since 2007.

But the shocking case of the trainee teachers has disrupted
his efforts to focus public attention away from violence and
onto a raft of economic reforms he has pushed through Congress.

Protesters: The demonstrators clashed with police over the presumed massacre of 43 students

Nieto has been under pressure from mass protests to end
impunity and rampant brutality by security forces since the 43
students were abducted.

Details of his plan have not been announced, but government officials have tried several similar anti-crime plans in the past, with mixed results.
