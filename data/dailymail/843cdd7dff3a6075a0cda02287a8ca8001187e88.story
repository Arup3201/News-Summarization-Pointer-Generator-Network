Late last year a body building champion and personal trainer from Christchurch, New Zealand, was caught smuggling illegal recreational drugs from overseas.

Stephen Michael Raymond Orton, who won the title of world champion at the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association in Italy in June 2013, admitted to importing nearly $100,000 worth of an ecstacy mimic from China.

On Thursday he was due to appear in Christchurch District Court for sentencing, according to stuff.co.nz. His lawyer was expected to seek a discharge without conviction.

This is so he would still be able to travel internationally for bodybuilding competitions, something that may be hindered if he were to spend time behind bars.

In May he pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the Class C drugs, which is said to have been about 700 grams of methylone.

According to court files seen by The Press, the 24-year-old was arrested after he admitted to receiving a number of packages which had been intercepted at Auckland Airport.

Custom officials then carried out what is known as a 'controlled delivery', where one of the packages is monitored while it's sent to the intended address. This took place on November 28.

Orton admitted he was the intended recipient and told police he had been instructed to leave the packages on the porch of his house, and would be paid $500 for each delivery.

The bodybuilder, who works at NZ fitness chain Les Mills, also told officers he thought the packages may contain an ingredient to make drugs but he did not know for sure.

The 709 grams which customs seized was estimated to have a street value of nearly $95,000 once it had been cut with other substances.

On Thursday he was set to appear on court for sentencing over the two charges, which he pleaded guilty to in May

Orton is active on social media and often posts photos and videos of his training sessions

Orton has a strong social media presence and often posts photos and videos of his workouts to his Facebook page and YouTube channel.

He calls himself 'The Ox' and asks people to 'Follow me on my quest to reach my dream of a Professional Bodybuilding status.'

The New Zealander has apparently been making waves in the bodybuilding industry, and has been pinned as a possible future Mr Olympia, the competition made famous by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
