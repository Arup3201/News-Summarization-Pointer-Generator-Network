Swansea midfielder Jose Canas has left the club and joined Spanish club Espanyol after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.

Canas made 35 appearances in all competitions for Swansea last season following his free transfer from Real Betis.

The 27-year-old was signed by former Swansea manager Michael Laudrup in the summer of 2013 and featured heavily in the club's Europa League campaign.

But Canas' last game for the Welsh club was at Everton at the end of March and new manager Garry Monk told the Spaniard in the summer that he was not part of his plans.

Canas, who had also been linked with Spanish club Elche, returns to La Liga by joining an Espanyol side that has picked up one point from their opening two top-flight matches.

'Everyone at Swansea City would like to thank Jose for his services to the club, and wish him well for the future,' said a club statement.
