Marilyn Manson attempted to avoid the paparazzi heading into the airport - by scrawling obscenities across his face in black pen.

The goth singer, dressed fully in black with hat and mirrored sunglasses, had 'f*** you' written on his face and neck as he entered the terminal at Los Angeles Airport on Friday.

Manson, otherwise known as Brian Hugh Warner, was accompanied by his glamorously-dressed girlfriend Lindsay Usich who seemed more than happy to smile for the cameras.

Attention-seeker: Manson explained to fellow travelers that the obscenity wasn't directed at them but at the paparazzi lying in wait outside LAX

The rocker explained to a fellow traveler while waiting in security line that he had made the statement so that the paparazzi could not sell pictures of him.

The comment, posted by j_patrick_12 on Reddit, said: 'I just went through the LAX security line with Marilyn Manson. He had F**** scrawled in large letters across the bottom half of his face, with what appeared to be a grease pencil.

'As we each removed our boots in the security line, he kindly explained that it was not directed at me or anyone else in the airport, but rather at the paparazzi, so that they couldn't sell any photos of him that they took. He was really apologetic about it, and covered his mouth around young children while apologizing to their parents for exposing their child to profanity.'

However unfortunately for Manson, the stunt appeared to backfire with the photos appearing all over the Internet.

The apparently publicity-shy Manson also posted the picture of himself on Twitter with the message: 'Re-LAX. If you are close enough to read this...'

Manson has reportedly been in a relationship with American photographer Ms Usich since March. She is credited as having produced the cover art for his latest album Born Villain.Â
