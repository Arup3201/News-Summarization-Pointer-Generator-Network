Police have found a woman's body in the trunk of a car belonging to a couple and their four young children who went missing in Southern California.

The Honda Accord belonging to Daniel and Erica Perez and their sons, aged from six to 11, was found near a hospital about half a mile from their home in Montebello, police said.

Capt Luis Lopez would say only that a dead woman was found in the trunk, but would not provide her identity or cause of death, deferring those and other details to the coroner's office.

Lopez called the discovery 'alarming', adding: 'We are concerned for their safety'. 

He said: 'At this point, Mr Perez is considered a person of interest, so if he’s seen or the children are seen we urged everybody to call the police department.'

The family had not been seen since Friday and neither adult had been answering their phone.

Lopez said an Amber Alert is now being issued for a 2014 black Toyota Camry with California license plate 7FDS891 connected to the family.

'We are concerned for their safety': Police are searching for the couple's four sons Jordan, 11, Jaiden, 9, Tristan, 8, and Alex, 6, after their car was found around half a mile from their home

Family members told investigators the couple's marriage was unstable and there was a history of domestic violence, police said.

They made a public plea for the safe return of the children -  Jordan, 11, Jaiden, 9, Tristan, 8, and Alex, 6.

Their aunt Pamela Valdez said: 'Please, Daniel, please just drop the kids off. They are innocent.'

Montebello is about 15 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
