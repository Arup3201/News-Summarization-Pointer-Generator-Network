Business tycoon Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States is 'becoming a third-world country,' declared the nation's true unemployment rate is 'probably 21 or 22 percent,' and warned that Barack Obama's approval ratings were approaching the malaise of 'the late, great Jimmy Carter.'

Carter, the 39th U.S. president, is very much alive.

The gaffe took the luster off of an otherwise energetic presentation at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C., one that was lacking any hint that Trump might run for president in 2016.

Railing against federal tax and other economic mandates that will trigger in the years after President Barack Obama leaves office, Trump said he predictions of 'economic catastrophe' in 2017 and 2018 are flying through the business community.

'Whoever's president [then], good luck!' he exclaimed. You're going to have to be very smart. You're going to have to be very sharp.'

A frustrated Donald Trump said he's anticipating economic calamities right after President Barack Obama leaves office, and said the U.S. is 'becoming a Third World country'

Still kicking: Rumors of Jimmy Carter assuming 'late, great' status, as Trump referred to him Thursday, are greatly exaggerated

'Our country is in serious, serious trouble,' Trump lamented. 'We owe $17 trillion – our debt. How do you pay off $17 trillion? ... We have deficits that no one can even comprehend.'

Obama, he insisted, is 'so weak and so pathetic' that China's leaders know they can devalue their currency without any consequences.

'They believe that they can get away with it,' Trump said. 'And believe me, they're taking our jobs, and they're taking them big-league .... They have no respect for our leader.'

Unemployment, Trump told thousands gathered at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, is 'probably 21 or 22 percent' in 'real numbers.'

'When you give up looking for a job, it's like they consider you employed,' he complained.

The U.S. Department of Labor said in January that the nation's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent. But the so-called 'U-6' unemployment measure, which counts short-term workers and those who have taken themselves out of the labor force,' is early twice as high – 13.1 per cent.

MailOnline couldn't find any economic research suggesting a 21 or 22 per cent unemployment rate in the U.S.

Trump could get into the presidential race in 2016, but seemed to suggest he'll sit it out

Trump said he sees 'so little leadership from the White House,' topped off with a crumbling infrastructure – airports, roads and bridges – that slows down business entrepreneurs

'We're becoming a third-world country,' he complained.

After noting briefly that the Obamacare law 'has to be changed – has to be!' Trump warned conservatives that siding with advocates of immigration reform will bring Election Day legitimacy to a slew of new Democratic Party voters.

'Every one of those votes goes to the 
Democrats.... you will not get any of those votes no matter what you do,
 no matter how nice you are, no matter how soft you are,' he said.

Coming down on the side of closed-border hawks, an exasperated Trump threw up his hands.

'We're either a country or we're not. We either have borders or we don't,' he told an appreciative crowd.

'I mean, you have a border, you have a country, and if you don't have a border, what are we? Uh, uh, uh – nothing.'

Trump will appear at an April 12 summit in New Hampshire alongside Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Minnesota Rep. Marsha Blackburn.
