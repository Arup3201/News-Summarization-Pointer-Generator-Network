Smears: Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in 1993 in a racist attack in Eltham, South London, that shocked Britain

Police have found ‘no evidence whatsoever’ that undercover officers were tasked with smearing the family of Stephen Lawrence, a chief constable said yesterday.

And the man who made the smear claim has so far refused to speak to the team investigating his allegations.

Mick Creedon, who is leading an inquiry into the activities of Scotland Yard’s now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad, told MPs he has not seen anything to back up the dirty tricks allegations.

He was responding to allegations last 
month from Peter Francis. The former undercover officer alleges that in 
the aftermath of Stephen’s murder he was ordered to find ‘dirt’ for use 
against members of his family.

Mr
Francis, 47, said he was also asked to target Stephen’s friend Duwayne 
Brooks, who witnessed the 1993 murder in Eltham, south-east London, and 
other campaigners furious at the failure to bring the killers to 
justice.

Yesterday it 
emerged that Mr Francis, who suffered a mental breakdown before leaving 
the Met in 2001, has so far refused to speak to Derbyshire Police chief 
Mr Creedon about his Lawrence family smear allegations.

Speaking
at a meeting of the Commons home affairs committee, Mr Creedon admitted
his 20-month inquiry – codenamed Operation Herne – had uncovered 
references to relatives of the murdered teenager among the files of 
Scotland Yard’s undercover units.

But he said this was purely because officers were targeting protest groups that they feared could spark violence.

Asked if there was evidence of a smear campaign, Mr Creedon replied: ‘No, none. There is limited reporting within our incident room that relates to Stephen Lawrence’s murder, including references to Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville.

‘There is no evidence whatsoever. We are really keen to speak to officers deployed at that time, including Peter Francis.’

Target? Duwayne Brooks, a friend of Stephen's who witnessed his murder, was among those allegedly targeted by undercover officers who were trying to get 'dirt' on those involved in the campaign for justice

Mr Creedon said he was keen to meet Mr and Mrs Lawrence and hoped to be able to reassure them about his work. He said a public inquiry, which has been called for by the family, may not be the best way to get to the truth.

He added: ‘I may be naïve but I hope to explain how we can investigate this and build trust.’

It is understood that Mr Creedon’s team is examining previously archived Special Branch documents and files relating to the Lawrence case in an attempt to establish the truth about Mr Francis’s allegations.

Home Secretary Theresa May indicated yesterday she would back a public inquiry if it was supported by lawyer Mark Ellison QC who is leading a review of allegations of police corruption in the original investigation into Stephen’s death.
