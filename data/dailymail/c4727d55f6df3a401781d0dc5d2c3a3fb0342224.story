One of Britons' favourite places to visit in North Africa has been named the world's top destination by TripAdvisor users.

With its desert landscape and bustling souks, Marrakech came out on top in the website's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time.

It finished ahead of Siem Reap in Cambodia and Istanbul in Turkey, which finished second and third, respectively. London missed out on a spot in the top five, finishing sixth.

Marrakech came out on top in TripAdvisor's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time

Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic rounded out the top five. 

Some results were surprising, as New York failed to make the top ten for the second year in a row.

Traditional holiday destinations in North America and Western Europe were trumped by cities or resorts in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.

London ranked sixth in TripAdvisor's study, behind Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic

1. Marrakech - £60.272. 

2. Siem Reap - £37.71

3. Istanbul - £71.66

4. Hanoi - £27.06

5. Prague - £57.83

6. London - £162.25

7. Rome - £86.72

8. Buenos Aires - £63.21

9. Paris - £114.34

10. Cape Town - £77.21

The awards from the world's largest travel review site judge destinations on a worldwide scale, in Europe and in the UK. 

Siem Reap in Cambodia leaped in the ratings from last year, gaining seven places to take second place.

In fourth place, Hanoi offered the cheapest hotel rooms at under £30 a night.

Last year's runner-up, Rome,  slipped five places to take seventh place. 

London similarly slipped from third to sixth place, although it is only one of three cities which have secured a top ten spot five years in a row.

'The competition among global tourist destinations has never been tougher,' said TripAdvisor spokesperson James Kay.

'A combination of low average booking rates and fantastic traveller reviews on TripAdvisor has helped Asian, African and Eastern European destinations steal a march on old favourites like New York and Rome.'

New York, one of the world's most visited cities, failed to crack the top ten for the second year in a row

Steve Jackson, TripAdvisor's top contributor of photos in 2014, said: 'Marrakech is one of those cities that should be on everyone's bucket list.

'It's a fantastic city to explore, rich in history and culture, and between the sea of street activity, bright colours and striking sunsets, it is a truly intoxicating experience.' 

In the UK it was the northern cities that took the top spots, taking eight of the ten best rated UK destinations.  

Blackpool, famed for its tower and beach, had the cheapest hotel room rate out of the UK's top destinations

Despite London being named the best UK city, Llandudno and Torquay beat rivals Liverpool, Belfast and York. 

Lake District's Keswick featured in the top ten for the first time beating Glasgow.

Blackpool, in sixth place, had the cheapest hotel room rate in the top ten at £76.21, less than half the rate for a similar room in London.
