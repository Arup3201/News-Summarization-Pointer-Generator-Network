Click here to read Matt Lawton on how the Liverpool boss put his faith in 3-4-3

Liverpool have not suffered Premier League defeat since falling 3-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Sunday’s match at Anfield is a measure of how far they have come.

United have been more hit and miss in that period, but still only lost twice in the league. They produced their best display of the season in the 3-0 victory over Tottenham.

Plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while Brendan Rodgers and Louis Van Gaal have toyed with their systems.

Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 3-4-3 formation favoured by Liverpool to fit as many attackers in as possible. Why not.

The Liverpool and Manchester United composite XI selected by Sportsmail

Goalkeeper – David de Gea

The outstanding goalkeeper in England and arguably the best in the world right now. Seems to pull off a save a real substance every game, offers good distribution, and exudes calm from his penalty box.

David de Gea has been outstanding between the sticks for Manchester United this season

Centre-back – Chris Smalling

A surprise perhaps, but turned in one of his best games in a United shirt against Spurs. He was strong, brought the ball out with assurance, and picked a pass more than once.

Chris Smalling produced one of his best performances of the season in United's win over Spurs last week

Centre-back – Michael Carrick

Not his ideal position but for want of excellent defenders could easily operate here. His anticipation and experience are valuable. A breathe of air to United’s team after returning from injury.

Centre-back – Emre Can

Has blossomed in his converted role in Liverpool’s back three. Deceptively quick because of his hulking frame, and an excellent ball player.

Emre Can 

Right wing-back – Adam Lallana

Such a skilful player clever enough to function in a variety of positions. Offers energy and trickery down the flank and a threat when cutting in.

Left wing-back – Ashley Young

Has enjoyed a really consistent season and seems to be growing under Van Gaal. A menace down the left n recent games with renewed drive and end product.

Centre midfield – Philippe Coutinho

Dazzling talent and goal threat from any range. The oil to make the midfield cogs roll seamlessly along and possesses the imagination to unlock defences in the final third.

Centre midfield – Jordan Henderson

The steely core to the team and the best-performing midfielder in England right now. Two stunning goals from distance in his recent back catalogue and a formidable mentality to seep across the side.

Right wing – Raheem Sterling

Brings whippet pace to stretch defenders and is illustrating his flexibility by coping intelligently to requests by Rodgers for positional changes. An absolute terror at his optimum.

Left wing – Daniel Sturridge

Has not yet burst to life since his comeback from injury, but offering enough glimpses to force his way into this imaginary line-up. A potent scoring danger and able to assist as well.

Striker – Wayne Rooney

Back to his best as a snarling centre-forward, with five goals in his last six games, so let him continue there. Vast experience, vast ability and a ferocious desire to win.

So six Liverpool players to five from United, eight Englishmen, and a team full of attacking intent. Marouane Fellaini would be first off the substitutes bench to offer a physical presence up front.
