So far, police appear to at a loss as to who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week.

So far, police appear to at a loss as to
 who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in 
the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week.

The shooting of the popular lawyer has 
stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in
 Florida's state capital.

A fund was set up at the start of the week to benefit his sons Benjamin Amichai Markel and Lincoln Jonah Markel.

Those close to him have spoken of how he loved his students, his colleagues, his friends, his scholarly work, and helping all those in need.

'Most of all, he loved his faith and his family. Ben and Lincoln were his heart. Danny will live every day in our hearts, and we must work together to ensure his most beloved little bears know how much their Abba was loved and what a great, wise, amazing man and father he was...and how much he loved them,' the site states.

As the investigation gathers pace, police have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of
 a white Toyota Prius that was seen close to the crime scene.

'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent.

'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.'

However,
 with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to 
reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will 
volunteer and incriminate themselves.

'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said.

Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, a day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far.

'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway.

Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am last Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home.

He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries.

'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.'

Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father

Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013

Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic.

Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming.

He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg.

Intentional? Police are investigating the 
possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside
 his Tallahassee home on Friday morning

Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year.

They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues.

Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect.

A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel.

'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read.

'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous.

'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.'

Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by their friends death

His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key.

Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.

'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.'

Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened.

'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught.

'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire.

'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'
