Dark matter is one of the holy grails of astrophysics - for decades scientists have been trying to work out exactly what this invisible matter is.

It’s thought to make up the majority of the universe yet experts still do not understand what it is.

A new study, however, using public data from Nasa’s Fermi space telescope might finally provide some answers.

This false-colour image of the centre of our Milky Way reveals excess gamma ray emissions that could be the result of dark matter particles colliding

Assistant Professor Dan Hooper and his colleagues at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, have been studying a signal at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy since 2009.

Consisting of a haze of gamma rays - extremely high energy radiation - the scientists are now convinced that the signal was produced by dark matter particles crashing into each other.

As they destroy one another, these release gamma rays into space, giving rise to a perceivable glow at the centre of the Milky Way.

Similar detections in nearby dwarf galaxies, those smaller than our own, could further suggest the theory may be correct.

Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It
cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be 
out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we 
can see.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists and 
is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or 
where to find it.

‘This is the most compelling signal we’ve had for dark matter particles – ever,’ Hooper told New Scientist.

To confirm their finding, the scientists had to rule out other possibilities for the signal, including the gamma rays being produced by a distant pulsar or rapidly spinning star.

They found the gamma rays produced a sphere nearly 10,000 light-years wide around the galactic centre, ruling out the possibility of pulsars being the source.

‘That doesn’t rule out things that no one’s thought of yet,’ Hooper added.

‘But we’ve tried pretty hard to think of something without success.’

If their findings turn out to be correct, it poses some tough questions about dark matter.

Previously, scientists had thought dark matter was made of a hypothetical particle known as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP).

If dark matter is being produced and colliding at the centre of our galaxy, however, then it is much more likely to be a heavier particle.

This would cast doubt on some of the previous evidence for dark matter we have from experiments on Earth.

If the detection found by Professor Hooper and his team is shown to match similar signals at the heart of other galaxies, it will more strongly suggest their findings are correct.

Hooper and his team used data from Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), in orbit since 2008, to make their discovery

If other galaxies are found to have similar signals at their centres it could could confirm the findings
