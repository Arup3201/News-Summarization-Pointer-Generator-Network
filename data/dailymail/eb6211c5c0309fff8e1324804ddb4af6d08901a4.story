West Ham outcast Ravel Morrison has completed his medical with Lazio and is set to finalise his move to the Serie A club.

The 21-year-old's visit to Rome to sign a pre-contract looked in danger on Tuesday after West Ham initially blocked the trip because he did not have permission to fly to the Italian capital.

But Morrison's free transfer will be confirmed when he signs the papers to join Lazio on July 1 ahead of the next Serie A season.

West Ham knew they could not stop Morrison, who is expected to sign a three-year deal. 

His contract with the London club expires this summer, and he was recently dumped in their Under-21 squad by manager Sam Allardyce.

La Lazio Siamo Noi wrote on their website: 'Medical examinations completed by Ravel Morrison.

'Along with one of the agents of his entourage, Nick Rubery, and the team manager Maurizio Manzini, the talent of West Ham is now directed to the Sports Center of Formello. 

'Waiting for him, the papers to be signed to become - as of July 1, 2015 - a Lazio player.'

Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was in August
