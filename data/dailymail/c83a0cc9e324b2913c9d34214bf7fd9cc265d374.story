A Japanese company has set up an exclusive holiday programme for teddy bears.

Sonoe Azuma, 38, of Unagi Travel, based in Tokyo, Japan, organises stuffed animal tours throughout Japan, Europe and the United States.

Unagi is the name the Japanese use for eels, and the company takes its name from when Ms Azuma used a picture of the fish as her online avatar, and her friends began taking pictures of themselves with an eel on various trips around the world.

While the idea came to Ms Azuma as a bit of a joke, it offers the owners of the stuffed animals a chance to see some fantastic locations throughout the world through the eyes of their toys.

The photo's of the teddy bear's holiday are posted onto Unagi Travel's Facebook page, so the owners get to witness some of their adventures.

Prior to the owners shipping out their bear to the Tokyo base, they must fill out a questionnaire regarding the cuddly toy's dietary requirements, keen interests and hobbies.

There are a number of tour packages to chose from. Your bear can be whisked on a mystery tour for $35 and could end up anywhere in the world.

Then there are the set tours; Tokyo is $45, Onsen Hot Spring costs $55, with Kamakura also priced at $55. 

The client is expected to cover the cost of posting the toy out to Tokyo, with the company paying the return leg. The furry friends must weigh no more than 250 grams.

The toys are selected for a special journey - it could be a 'mystery' which has seen toys posted all over the world and to famous tourist hotspots

One satisfied customer is Colin Green, who lives in Hull, Massachusetts, US.

He sent his girlfriend Megan Small's stuffed cat, Meggy Weggy, on a trip to Japan.

Speaking to Inquisitr, Mr Green said: 'You're vicariously living through your stuffed animal. Because Megan and I eventually want to go to Japan… now we have a tour guide we can bring. She scoped it out for us.'

The stuffed animals will spend between two and three weeks in a city.
