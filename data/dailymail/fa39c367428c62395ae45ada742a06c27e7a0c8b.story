A woman has pleaded guilty to torturing and starving her teenage stepdaughter and keeping her locked in the basement.

The 43-year-old woman from Madison, Winsconsin, admitted one count of first degree reckless endangering safety and one count of causing mental harm to a child at the beginning of her trial in Dane County.

As part of a deal with prosecutors, four other charges against the unidentified woman, who faces up to 25 years in jail, were dropped but read into the record.

Guilty plea: A 43-year-old woman from Madison, Wisconsin (pictured) is accused of abusing her teenage step-daughter (file picture)

Her victim, a 15-year-old girl, was found barefoot and thinly clothed by a neighbour after running away from home in February last year.

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the girl suffered years of abuse at the hands of her stepmother, father and stepbrother.

Criminal charges filed allege that the girl was beaten, starved and sexually abused.

She was allegedly also forced to eat her own excrement.

Officials at various agencies had reportedly missed several opportunities to rescue the girl from her plight.

A passing motorist had called police in January 2011 after trying to talk to the girl who seemed fragile and whose bare feet were purple.

But when police called at the girl's home no one answered and officers left.

In 2007 allegations were made that the girl had been molested, but those allegations were not corroborated by the girl herself.

According to records obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, police visited the girl's home 10 times in total.But most of the reports that brought them to the family home centered on the girl's stepbrother.

After she ran away in 2012, she was examined by specialist doctors who said that the girl had been subjected to 'serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation.'

Her father was found guilty of felony child neglect last month, but no verdict was reached on four other charges.

Her stepbrother, who has been charged with two counts of sexual assault and one count of child abuse will be tried in June.

None of the parties involved have been named by the Milwaukee Journey Sentinel to protect the victim's identity.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
