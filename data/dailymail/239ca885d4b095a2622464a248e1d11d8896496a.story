ENGLAND

ALASTAIR COOK - 5

He needs to ask himself: ‘Am I making this England cricket team a  better team?’

From the outside it doesn’t appear that he is. At the moment the same mistakes are happening time after time, whether it be batting collapses, being bounced out, bowling too short.

The captaincy doesn’t come naturally to him but it is not something you are going to give up easily, believe me. It is the best job an England cricketer can have but he needs to decide if he is making a difference.

Ready to walk: Cook leaves the crease after being dismissed during day four of the second Test 

Defeat: Cook leaves the field after India's victory on day five of the second Test at Lord's

Looking forward: Cook's leadership qualities have come under fire during his time as England captain

VIDEO I will not walk away - Cook

Would we miss Cook the captain if he didn’t turn up at The Ageas Bowl? No, I don’t think so. But are we missing Cook the world-class batsman with all those Test hundreds? Yes, definitely.

When I gave up the captaincy I literally woke up one morning and decided I’d had enough. I’d started to notice in the field that I’d lost the dressing room and I knew inside I was out of energy and it was affecting my decision-making. I knew my time was up.

I didn’t think me being captain would make England a better team and that is what Cook must decide. I’ve heard people say that there is no one else but that is not a good enough reason to keep the status quo.

If you decide he is not the right man for the job then you can find someone else.

What went wrong: Cook, third left, and coach Peter Moores, second right, look on during day five

SAM ROBSON - 4

Having seen Murali Vijay bat on a pitch like that he should have learned you have to leave the ball well outside off-stump. With Robson, Cook and Ballance at the top of the order England are very  one-paced.

GARY BALLANCE - 8

Another very good hundred in the first innings and looks a good, solid player like a lot of the young lads in the side. Very reliable and will bat at No 3 for a while.

IAN BELL - 4

A victim of the curse of the England Player of the Year award. A bit like Matt Prior the year before, the wheels have come off since he got it. He will consider himself unlucky in this Test but his lack of runs is going under the radar because of Cook’s struggles.

Shock: Ian Bell looks on in disbelief after being bowled by India bowler Ishant Sharma at Lord's

JOE ROOT - 7

Excellent counter-attacking cricket in the second innings. He will be  disappointed with the shot he got out to but he needs to be  positive. He’s a solid, tough cricketer and looks more  impressive every time I see him.

MOEEN ALI - 6

Got runs in both innings and some useful wickets as well. Looks a very elegant player but he needs to work on the short ball because he cannot take his eye off it like he did yesterday just before lunch.

Lonely walk: Matt Prior has decided to take some time out from England duty following the defeat

Uncertain: Prior looks on from the home team balcony during England's loss to India at Lord's

MATT PRIOR - 4

I'm not surprised he has decided to step aside for now because of injury. He looks shot to me, both mentally and physically.

The selectors need to look at the senior players and decide if they are past their best. Prior has been a fantastic wicketkeeper-batsman — one of  England’s very best — but he has to decide if he wishes to go on long-term for his country.

Another injection of youth and mental energy could well help England because there are clearly still some mental scars from Australia. There are some battered and bruised players in that team at the moment. Prior played a poor shot in the second innings before the new ball.

BEN STOKES - 5

I thought he bowled well in both innings and pitched the ball up. He bowled with passion and seems to be the go-to man.

Unfortunately his batting has fallen off a cliff and, in that respect, it looks as if he is mentally just gone.

STUART BROAD - 5

Guilty of bowling too short in the first innings and needed to pitch the ball up more. He and Anderson both bowled too short on that first day and it cost England the Test.

LIAM PLUNKETT - 8

It was a big game for him because everyone was asking whether he would be able to bowl on a green pitch and he showed he could. Useful runs and looks a very good all-round cricketer.

JIMMY ANDERSON - 6

At least he corrected his mistakes from the first innings but in the old days he would have used those  conditions better. He seems to have become more of a hit-the-deck bowler as he has got older.

Former England captain Hussain thinks Cook would perform better without the burden of being captain

He also believes Prior's decision to step back from England duty is a good one, with the wicket-keeper struggling for fitness and form

Hussain thinks Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett were the standout performers for England, while Ajinkya Rahan led the way for India at Lord's
