A U.S. designer has created a thought-provoking video of what a world policed by ‘security drones’ might look like.

Alex Cornell’s video, which is set on the streets of San Francisco gives a drone's-eye view of the city and suggests what sort of security operations the controversial technology might be used for.

The film, which is called ‘Our Drone Future,’ explores the technology, capability and purpose of drones as he predicts their presence will be ‘increasingly pervasive in the skies of tomorrow’.

The drone in the video which is produced by Mr Cornell, a designer and co-founder and creative director of San Francisco-based firm Firespotter Labs, is able to read information about the city far below, including the number of cars and people on Golden Gate Bridge at any given time.

‘In the near future, cities use semi-autonomous drones for urban security. Human officers monitor drone feeds remotely, and data reports are displayed with a detailed HUD (heads up display) and communicated via a simulated human voice (designed to mitigate discomfort with sentient drone technology),’ he explained on YouTube.

‘While the drones operate independently, they are “guided" by the human monitors, who can suggest alternate mission plans and ask questions,’ he said.

The security drone in the video can analyse traffic density, detect if there is any ‘malicious intent’ from drivers, identify specific people in cars and predict criminal activity in certain areas.

The machine specialises in predictive analysis and the security drones can re-task themselves to investigate potential threats, which raises many questions about whom is in control of whom.

As the video draws to a close the viewer digests just how much flying robots might be able to glean about the lives of humans below.

There is also the spectre of a ‘humans versus drones’ struggle as the robot encounters ‘fierce civilian resistance’.

While drones are currently used in wars and controlled by human operators, there are plans to roll out the technology in less sinister ways.

Amazon has announced plans to deliver packages by drone in the next five years and German delivery service DHL has just conducted a test flight that could one day see medicine flown to hard-to-reach locations using remote-controlled drones.
