When one of Sean Abbott's team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK.

That's according to friends and mentors from Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-west Sydney institution where the 22-year-old known to his mates as Sabs or Sabba grew up belting cricket balls.

Three days after Abbott bowled the fatal ball that critically injured Phillip Hughes, local club members have joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming cricketer. 

Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.'

The Australian team doctor, Dr Peter Brukner, spoke of the concerns for Abbott, who had been at St Vincent's Hospital, where Hughes lost his life, and had been receiving support from his teammates

'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events. 

'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, "Don't worry about it, it's okay".'  

Today, it is the Australian cricketing community who are patting Abbott on the back, after what doctors said was a 'very freakish' accident. 

Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke have both consoled the devastated cricketer, who was just doing his job.

And they were far from alone. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have both spoken in support of the struggling cricketer.

Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'. 

And social media users posting #putyourbatsout tributes penned scores of well wishes for Abbott. 'Shed a tear today, devastated for Phil Hughes, his family, Sean Abbott and cricket lovers,' said one. 

Abbott, who Club sources said was a focused and mature player even in his youth, is an inspiration for many of the young people who take to the pitch at Baulko.

'We're very proud of him for being our first Australian representative,' said Baulkham Hills Cricket Club Vice President Peter McLoughlin. 

The club's Facebook page is chockers with Abbott's achievements and the club has invited Abbott to speak its next crop of cricketers in the past. 

His love of sport was encouraged at Hills Sports High School, near Seven Hills in Sydney's west, and he was playing representative cricket for Parramatta by his mid-teens. 

Despite the recent accident, Abbott has had a stellar year on the pitch

Former test quick Staurt Clark said that Abbott had just been 'doing his job', which was to 'intimidate' the batsman

The star spinner, who has rugby league in his blood, has had a stellar 2014 on the pitch despite the recent accident. 

He came to the attention of national selectors in May when he took out the Steve Waugh Medal, the Sheffield Shield's best player of the season - a high honour. 

In a photograph in October, Abbott appeared pleased to be awarded his green and gold Australia One Day International hat by cricket legend Dean Jones.  

'He's a genuine type of guy who's worked hard to get there and he knows where he came from, if you know what I mean,' Mr McLoughlin told Daily Mail Australia. 

'All kids want to be Allan Border or Steve Waugh or bloody something and when you see a bloke who played for your club, they all know hard work will get them there, hopefully.' 

Mr Chatman said: 'He'll just be so devastated it's a ball he bowled. For him, I know he'll really struggle.'

But, Mr Chatman said, he's got plenty of support. From the highest levels, too. 

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 

'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him.

'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.'
