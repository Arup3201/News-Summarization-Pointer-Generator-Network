Sunderland manager Gus Poyet criticised the inconsistency of referee Craig Pawson after their defeat against Liverpool.

Pawson sent Sunderland midfielder Liam Bridcutt off for two bookable offences at the Stadium of Light, but Poyet feels the official failed to show the same discipline for Liverpool.

Poyet believes Liverpool winger Philippe Coutinho should have been sent off for committing the same fouls as Bridcutt, and that Pawson put in an unacceptable performance.

'The foul (by Bridcutt) stopped an attack and if I'm being honest it could have been a yellow card,' Poyet said.

'But by the same rule Coutinho should also have had two yellow cards. 

'You cannot pick and choose - you either referee by the rules or by common sense, and I think the referee picked when he was going to referee by the rules and when by common sense, and that is not acceptable.'

Sunderland have not won at home since October, and Poyet begged for patience from unimpressed supporters after they made their feelings clear at the final whistle.

'We are trying and I think they (the fans) need to accept reality - I think they should look at what has been going on for four or five years and I think they should be a little more patient now,' he added.

'It's true that we don't give them too much and it's unfair to ask the fans for anything - we have to make sure we give them a few wins at home so they can enjoy them.

'We need to be positive. I think we lost the first 45 minutes of a very important game and when you do that against a team like Liverpool, normally you get punished - then we tried and played better when we were down to 10 men.

'But on the day it was not enough so it is a good way of learning that you cannot give too much away in a game like this.'
