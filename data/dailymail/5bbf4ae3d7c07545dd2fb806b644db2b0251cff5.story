Four women have testified about intimate relationships they had with a man while he was married to a woman he is now accused of strangling.

Samantha Duffy, Sabrina Lucia Strieck, Julie Hansen-Freeman and Renee Stewart told the court in King County, Washington that they had sexual relations with David Pietz while he was married to Nicole Pietz, who was found dead in a wooded area in Burien in February 2006.

Stewart also said Pietz also told her that he regularly drugged his wife's drinks with ecstasy to loosen her up and encourage her to take part in a threesome.

On trial: David Pietz is accused of murdering his wife after prosecutors claim he was unhappy in their marriage

Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz

The testimony comes in stark contrast with the loving, concerned husband Pietz portrayed as he took part in television interviews pleading for information after his wife went missing. Prosecutors claim he killed her after he became unhappy in their marriage.

Strieck, a former co-worker, testified that she and Pietz began a relationship when he was engaged.

'He told me he cared about me,' she said, King 5 News reported. 'I asked him why he was getting married, he said 
that at that point, it was too late to back out of it.'

She said their affair continued after the couple married and Ms Duffy said they also had a sexual relationship when he was with his wife.

Hansen Freeman added that she had an encounter with Pietz and another woman, explaining: 'Me, Katie and Davie. It was just the three of us kissing.'

Stewart, who Pietz met at a gym, 
testified that they kissed and said he told her he had twice put Ecstasy in his wife's drink 
while they were out. Nicole Pietz was a recovering drug addict.

Mistress: Sabrina Lucia Strieck testified that she had an affair with Pietz before and after he was married

Cruel: Renee Stewart said Pietz slipped Ecstasy into his wife's drink so she would go along with a threesome

Affair: Samantha Duffy said that she had sex with Pietz, while another woman said they kissed

On one occasion when she was out with the couple, Pietz propositioned her for a threesome and slipped his wife the drugs, Stewart said in court.

'He told me that he would put it in her Red Bull,' she said. 'He was just trying to loosen her up to get her to do a threesome.

'She became overtly sexual. She was willing to do things that seemed to be out of her character.'

The testimony came after jurors heard a recording of Pietz's interview with police in which he said he never used drugs and had a low sex drive.

'I don't have much of a libido,' he told police in the interview. 'She was usually, yeah just kind of opposite roles of what the stereotype is.'

Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in

Search: Investigators search their home after the disappearance and remove their computer

For years, there were no charges 
brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz, 34,
last year and charged him with second-degree murder after advances in 
technology.

Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in his marriage and now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence.

Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested earlier in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the scene, police said.

Investigators claimed there were contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test before refusing to undergo a second.

Mr
Pietz told police that on January 27 he got home from work around 
midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already 
sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest.

Emotional: Earlier this week, Gael Schneider, Nicole Pietz's mother, unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with the accused killer in court

Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case

The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day.

Mr
Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned
dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived.

He claims that she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit.

However, police said that forensic 
tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz
had been killed around midnight on January 27.

When
her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at 
night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; 
friends said she only took it off at night to clean it.

Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife

Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace.

And
DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her 
car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the 
University of Washington.

But defense attorneys have argued that their case is weak and that there were no eyewitnesses.

'It's not based on any direct evidence, and it's not going to show that David Pietz took Nicole's life,' Pietz's defense attorney Cooper Offenbecher said, ABC News reported.
