A Brazilian man who was stabbed in the head at a house party drove more than two hours to hospital with a 30cm knife sticking out the side of his skull.

Bleeding profusely from multiple stab wounds, Juacelo Nunes travelled 60 miles from the remote village of Agua Branca to the municipality of Teresina - both in northeastern Piaui state.

Upon arriving at the hospital with the blade still embedded in his head, doctors discovered the 39-year-old had  severed nerves and veins in his face - injuries that could easily have proved fatal.

But despite the serious nature of his injuries, the motorcycle taxi driver is expected to make a full recovery and is looking forward to spending tonight's New Year celebrations at home with his wife.

Mr Nunes was stabbed in the head after a fight broke out at a house party in Agua Branca at 4.30am on Sunday morning.

Witnesses said he had got into a dispute with one man, who then called over three of his friends to carry out the attack, which also left Mr Nunes with stab wounds to his throat, shoulder and chest.

As the four men battered Mr Nunes, at least one of them pulled out a knife and began stabbing him in the face and upper torso. The final blow saw a knife narrowly miss his left eye, pass through his mouth and embed itself in the right side of his upper jaw.

Remarkably Mr Nunes did not lose consciousness at any point and was able to stagger away from his attackers into his vehicle. He then made the grueling two hour, 60 mile journey along jungle roads to hospital in Teresina.

Once there he underwent three hours of emergency surgery to remove the blade.

'The knife passed through several nerves and veins, structures that can quickly kill a patient' said Gilberto Albuquerque, the director of the hospital in Teresina, told Brazil's G1 news website.

He added that the 39-year-old was recovering surprisingly well.

Mr Nunes said that he cannot remember the exact moment the knife entered his head, but said that he knows he did not faint or lose consciousness at any point. 

'I thought I would die and only came to believe when I saw what happened to me, because if someone told me I would not have believed it.' 

Mr Nunes' wife Francisca Pereira said she was shocked when she saw him with the knife in his skull, adding: 'I did not believe when I saw my husband like that... I thought he was going to die. It was a miracle.' 

The couple now plan to spend a quiet New Year's Eve at home with their family.
