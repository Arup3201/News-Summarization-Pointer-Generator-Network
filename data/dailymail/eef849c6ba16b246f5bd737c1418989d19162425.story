South 
Korean President Park Geun-hye tearfully apologised today for a ferry 
disaster that killed about 300 passengers and 
said she would break up the coastguard for failing in its duties.

Park
 has been hit hard by an angry nationwide outcry over the government's 
response to South Korea's worst civilian maritime disaster in 20 years 
and the seemingly slow and ineffective rescue operation.

Polls show support for Park has dropped by more than 20 points since the April 16 disaster.

'I
 apologise to the nation for the pain and suffering that everyone felt, 
as the president who should have been responsible for the safety and 
lives of the people,' Park said in a televised national address, her 
first since the Sewol capsized and sank with 476 passengers and crew on 
board.

She fought back sobs 
as she remembered some of the teenagers who perished trying to help one 
another, calling them heroes in an unprecedented show of emotion.

Park,
 who is serving a single five-year term, is the daughter of Park 
Chung-hee, the former military strongman who ruled for nearly two 
decades in the 1960s and 1970s. She lost both her parents to assassins.

At least 286 people were killed and 18 remain missing. Only 172 people were rescued, with the rest presumed to have drowned.

Of the passengers, 339 were children and their teachers on a field trip from a high school on the outskirts of Seoul.

Park
 vowed sweeping reforms to improve oversight, as well as tough 
punishment for bureaucrats and businesses whose negligence endangers 
public safety.

Investigators believe that the Sewol ferry, pictured, capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo

'A 
20-year-old vessel was bought and refurbished to add excessive capacity,
 then it was loaded with much more cargo than allowed with a false 
reporting on weight, but not a single person in the position to 
supervise stopped any of it,' Park said.

She
 singled out structural problems within the coast guard as the main 
reason why there was such a high casualty toll from an accident that 
played out on national television as the vessel gradually sank with most
 of the passengers trapped inside.

'Had
 there been an immediate and proactive rescue operation after the 
accident, we would have been able to reduce the casualties,' Park said.

The
 coast guard's rescue duties would be transferred to a national 
emergency safety agency to be set up and the national police will take 
over its investigative function, she said.

Some
 of the crew, including the captain, were caught on videotape abandoning
 ship while the children were repeatedly told to stay put in their 
cabins and await further orders.

Park
 has apologised in person to many family members of the victims but her 
administration has faced continued criticism and nationwide anger for 
its handling of the disaster.

Park's
 public support has dropped to 46 percent, from 70 percent before the 
accident, according to a recent poll. Her formal apology and the 
blueprint for bureaucratic reform have been criticised for coming too 
late, while her decision to break up the coast guard has also been 
questioned.

'Although we 
need to integrate government functions on safety and disaster 
management, dissolving the coast guard all of sudden can make more 
problems that may be difficult to fix,' said Professor Lee Jun-han of 
Incheon National University.

Park
 said the coast guard had not only failed in its search and rescue duty 
but that, in its current form, it would be unable to prevent another 
large-scale disaster.

'The 
coast guard continued to get bigger in size but did not have enough 
personnel and budget allocated for maritime safety, and training for 
rescue was very much insufficient,' she said.

All
 15 surviving crew members were indicted last week, including the 
captain and three senior crew members on homicide charges. The remaining
 11 crew were indicted for negligence.

The
 prosecution says the ferry was structurally defective after a 
remodelling to add capacity and was massively overloaded with cargo. A 
sharp turn then caused it to list and capsize.

The Sewol had been on a supposedly routine journey from the mainland port of Incheon south to the holiday island of Jeju.
