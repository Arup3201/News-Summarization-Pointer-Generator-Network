Most women prefer swimsuits to be as miniscule as possible – providing optimal opportunity to tan – but a new trend seemingly tries to achieve the opposite result.

Long-sleeve swimsuits, in which modesty takes precedence over a golden glow, have emerged as summer’s newest beach silhouette. While some boast sun-protecting benefits, not all are as resolute in their functionality.

The stylish wetsuit-like one-pieces are popping up everywhere from Urban Outfitters and ASOS to Neiman Marcus; and for beach-goers who want to show off slightly more skin, cropped, long-sleeve rash guards are proving to be the new ‘bikini’ of the season.

The long-sleeve swim styles run the aesthetic gamut from refined, understated elegance to loud, youth-inspired prints. While some promote their styles as a stylish antidote to the sun, with fabric that helps block a full-spectrum of UV rays, others have adapted to the trend with a full focus on fashion.

Many of the more tasteful, functional interpretations come from the trend's pioneer - a Dallas-based sun protectant clothing label named Cover.

The brand, which first introduced its long-sleeve one-pieces in 2012, is now hawking the styles at Neiman Marcus, as well as a luxury shopping site operated by Harper’s Bazaar.

It is the brainchild of Lisa Moore, who was inspired to create the label in 2007 after her little sister developed melanoma at the age of 23.

In an attempt to find her sister a chic suit that offered sun protection, Ms Moore quickly realized how few options there were. She set out make sun protection a personal pursuit by educating women how being smart about the sun does not mean skimping on style.

After the success of her rash guards and bikini bottoms grew, Ms Moore decided to launch a long-sleeve all-in-one style in five years later – a roll-out that doubled her company’s volume.

The designs are produced of a tightly-woven spandex that she says physically blocks sunrays from burning the skin underneath. They have consistently sold out each season – forcing her to reorder multiple production rounds from her manufacturers.

While many of Ms Moore's designs are offered in solids, with a contrast-colored waistband, she has also collaborated with contemporary artist Richard Phillips and photographer Gray Malin on a few styles that have been screenprinted with vivid pieces of their work.

In promotional shots the suits offer a somewhat nostalgic appearance, that on models, provides a refined silhouette reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's gamine conservatism.

But according to Ms Moore, the suits’ full-coverage sensibility is intended for women of all ages and body types, even extending beyond those with whittled waists.

She told MailOnline: ‘It’s actually very flattering…one of the nice things about it for larger size women is you can actually wear your best fitting bikini top underneath and keep it covered up – it provides the support you want and when you have larger arms you can feel more comfortable with this coverage.’

With fit fears abated, Ms Moore’s designs still draw misconceptions about their ability to regulate one’s body temperature. Conventional wisdom would lead one to believe that sitting in the sun wearing full sleeves would provide a sweating experience akin to an outdoor sauna.

Funner fare: Seea's $143 one-piece, and Yes Master's cut-out style (now on sale for $19.99 at Urban Outfitters) are reminiscent of designs popular beside the mainstage at this year's Coachella festival

But Ms Moore contests that her suit’s 
microfiber fabric adjusts according to the surrounding climate.

‘If you are in a cooler beach climate like northern 
California you remain dry and they protect you from the wind. If you are
 in a hot climate and it’s slightly damp it keeps you cool,’ she said.

Similar suits by American label Parasol, whose all-in-one styles are horizontally striped like a Petit Bateau bodysuit, claim to offer protection that equivocates to an SPF 50.

But for all of these designs' built-in functionalities, there are countless more long-sleeve styles that simply appear to be bikini recreations of outfits seen at this year’s Coachella festival.

Many retailers are describing their long-sleeve bikini designs as cropped rash guard sets, in reference to the surfboard-burn protecting shirts: lending an edge of athleticism to what is otherwise a pairing of a spandex crop top and underwear.

A cropped rash guard being sold at PacSun for $29 is formatted as a cropped baseball tee with a pineapple decal covering each breast. A $175 blue paisley style by Milly may have arms that extend down to the wrists, but its midsection abruptly ends just under the bust line.

While they may be appropriate, depending on your taste, for a DJ set poolside in Miami or at one of Thailand’s many beachfront raves, these suits’ classification as ‘rash guards’ are at odds with their actual performance - let alone their ability to block out the sun.

Fashion, not function: Many new swim tops, including Milly's $175 creation (left) and LA Heart's $29 design (right), are touting themselves as 'cropped rash guards,' and in doing so abandon the true principle of rash guards to begin with

Dr Lisa Airan, a New York-based dermatologist who often makes appearances on Vogue’s weekly best-dressed lists, explained to MailOnline: ‘People wear rash guards on a surfboard because there can be a lot of friction between the board and your skin – you can actually get superficial burns with the paddling if you are out there for hours.’

An avid surfer herself who often ventures to Maui for its massive waves, Dr Airan says that consumers seeking sun-protection need to be cognizant of the sun’s strength in their surrounding environment.

‘I have actually gotten sunburnt through fabric – I still wear a full layer of sunblock underneath the wetsuit,’ she says of her surfing procedures.

‘The sun can be so strong, if you want to wear [these suits] because you are hanging out on the beach and want to look cool, that’s one thing, but if you are surging and out there for hours you can get burned.’
