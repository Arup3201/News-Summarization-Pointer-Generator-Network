The price benefits were obvious. But some felt more than a little embarrassed to put Tesco’s blue-and-white-striped Value range in their baskets.

So much so, that the supermarket was forced to ditch the range completely.

The chain has admitted it relaunched the budget own-brand because shoppers ‘didn’t feel comfortable’ about picking it up.

Britain's biggest retailer, Tesco, has ditched its basic Value range

It has been replaced with a newly 
designed Everyday Value range, which features brightly coloured, more 
upmarket-looking packaging.

Andy Yaxley, commercial director of Tesco 
Fresh Food, said: ‘Embarrassed is probably the wrong word.

But customers told us that they questioned the quality of the Value brand because of the packaging and some didn’t feel comfortable putting it in their trolleys.

‘Tesco was the first supermarket to launch a value range. . .but customer needs have changed. We have listened closely to what our customers want and Everyday Value will provide products that taste better, look better and are healthier.’

Facesaver: The old and new labels. Tesco admitted that 'customers didn't feel comfortable' about putting value products in their shopping baskets

The new design features a smarter 
white and orange livery and forms part of sweeping changes that include a
revamped premium range.

The
retail giant said it is introducing posh bottled water which it has 
shipped in from Norway – the Voss brand will sell at a hefty  £4.89 a 
bottle.

The changes, which have been trialled over the past six months, are part of a £1 billion investment which will see 25pc of the grocer’s store space refitted this year.

It is also re-launching its frozen food department for the first time in 5 years, kitting its bakeries out with wood fittings and trialling patisseries. Clothing will be relegated to the back of the store to make way for fruit and vegetables at the entrance.

Customers will also be able to use a new scanning system so they will not need to pass items through tills. They will be able to scan their products as they put them into bags in their trolleys and then pay at the end.

It also found that shoppers felt its meat aisle was too clinical, so chief executive Phil Clarke had the shelves tilted at an angle to improve visibility and made the aisle ‘warmer’.

He said: ‘We are starting to seen green roots of progress. Some of the changes are already being rolled out in all Tesco stores and some are on trial.’
