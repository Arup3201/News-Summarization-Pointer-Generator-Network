Chelsea's Lewis Baker has spoken of his pride at captaining England's under 20 side and believes he is only just setting out on his journey with the Three Lions.

The 19-year-old, who is currently out on loan at League One side MK Dons, featured for England in their 1-1 draw with Mexico at Barnet on Wednesday night.

Aidy Boothroyd's team won the penalty shoot-out 4-2 after Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom won and then scored a penalty in normal time to cancel out Jose Ramirez's opener.

On the responsibility of being captain, Baker told Sportsmail: 'It's a great honour for me. Aidy chose me to be captain at the start of the campaign and that was a massive lift for me personally.

'But everyone in the team, we're all captains on the pitch in the game and we showed today that we can be a team and stick together through the bad times.

'I try to lead by example in what I do on the ball and off the ball. Everyone's aim to get to the under 21s and the seniors.

'All we can do is keep working hard, keeping doing what we can do and give your best.'

Although England looked the more likely to score after Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino was sent off for fouling Akpom for the penalty, they had been second best for much of the friendly at The Hive.

As they look towards the Toulon Tournament at the end of the season, Baker believes there is some room for improvement, starting with Sunday's friendly with the United States at Plymouth.

'We didn't perform today at the level we have performed at in previous games,' he admitted.

'They were a good side; I thought first-half they had the upper hand and could have scored a few goals but we kept persevering, stayed in the game, had a little talk at half-time on how to get better and we got the result.'

Akpom, who has been on the fringes of Arsene Wenger's first team all season, took his England under 20s tally to four when he drilled home his 78th minute penalty.

And Baker appreciates his game-changing qualities: 'When Chuba goes through on goal, everyone gets out of their seat because they know Chuba is a great goalscorer. He's done well today, getting the penalty and he scored in the shoot-out as well.'

On a personal level, Baker has scored two goals in five appearances for the Dons since arriving from Stamford Bridge and is set to play a pivotal role as Karl Robinson's men push for promotion.

He said: 'I've been playing under 21 at Chelsea for a while now and so the next step was to go on loan and at MK Dons now I'm under great care with the manager and the players.

'With the talent we have got at MK Dons there's no reason why we can't get into the play-offs or even gain automatic promotion.'
