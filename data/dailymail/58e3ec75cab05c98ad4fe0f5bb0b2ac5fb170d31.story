Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy has been arrested with his cousin and a friend on suspicion of rape.

A 34-year-old woman claims she was raped by three men and the Metropolitan Police have arrested three men at an address in Fulham, west London.

At this stage all three remain in custody.

The alleged 
victim visited the 26-year-old Premier League striker at his flat last 
week believing him to be alone.

A police statement read: 'Officers 
from Sapphire are investigating an allegation of rape which happened on 6
May in the west London area.

'The allegation was passed on to the 
MPS by Kent Police on 8 May after the 34-year-old female victim reported
it to them on the previous day, 7 May. The victim alleges she was raped
by three men.

'On the morning of Wednesday, 15 May 
three men, [A] aged 26; [B] aged 23; [C] 22 yrs, were arrested at an 
address in Fulham on suspicion of rape - they remain in custody at a 
west London police station.'

Goalscorer: Remy has performed well since joining Queens Park Rangers in the January window

Remy, who is paid £80,000 a week, joined QPR in January for £8million but was unable to help the team avoid relegation from the Premier League.

He is expected to leave the west 
London club this summer, with top clubs such as Arsenal, Tottenham and 
Liverpool reported to be interested in signing him.

Remy will hope to be available for the already-relegated Rangers' final game of the season away at Liverpool on Sunday.

A QPR spokesman said: 'The club is aware of the allegations regarding Loic Remy, but due to police investigations is unable to comment.'
