Plumbing disasters in South Australia has been exposed by an association who claim such 'predatory practices' can potentially put homeowners' lives at risk. 

This has prompted the plumbing industry to hold a crisis meeting this month with the state consumer watchdog.

Various examples of 'bad plumbing' were revealed in this month's edition of the Plumbing Industry Association of South Australia magazine and The Advertiser, including a bathroom sink which empties into a toilet bowl and a witches hat throne.

Bad plumbing in South Australia is a growing concern and can potentially put homeowners' lives at risk, a plumbing association claims

The association's membership manager Paul Worthington says the poor quality of work undermines the industry's integrity whilst it can also be costly and deadly for consumers.

'There are predatory practices where customers are being ripped off as plumbers are taking short cuts to save money,' Mr Worthington told Daily Mail Australia.

'The SARS outbreak was a direct result of poor plumbing - so that's the kind of potential we're facing here.'

He gave a number of examples including a photo of an exposed copper gas pipe, which is supposed to be installed at least 300mm underground, and a bathroom sink which empties into a toilet bowl.

The Advertiser also published images of other examples of shoddy plumbing such as a witches hat toilet, a tap which doesn't quite reach the sink and a bathroom with no leg room.

Mr Worthington says he was made aware of the diminishing standards nine years ago, when he first surveyed association members.

He has since been lobbying for this issue and says the scheduled meeting with Commissioner for Consumer Affairs Dini Soulio is long overdue.

'We found that 75 per cent of our members wanted better policing of work practices and the feedback is still overwhelming,' he said.

'The standards and regulations do exist but they need to be enforced in a methodical way that will keep plumbers on their toes.

'Ever since the self-regulation system came into place about 10 to 15 years ago, the quality of work has deteriorated.'

Mr Worthington says the decline in plumbing income, increasing material costs and lacking number of inspectors have all played a part in the reduced standards.

'There's huge pressure to get the job but this just isn't good enough and it's exposing people to unnecessary risks,' he said.

'We shouldn't be worried about these kind of building practices in a first world country.'

This month's meeting will see the state's key stakeholders, which include the housing industry, master builders, plumbing and electrical associations, highlight the failings of the industry.

Daily Mail Australia is waiting a response from the Commissioner.
