Rory McIlroy is looking forward to a hero’s welcome in Northern Ireland this weekend and hoping to parade both his major championship trophies at Old Trafford on Saturday.

‘I’ll definitely be at the first game of the season with the Claret Jug and while I don’t know if I can parade the Wanamaker Trophy at the same time, I will try,’ said the Manchester United fan.

McIlroy made it two majors in four weeks with his gripping, one-stroke victory in the USPGA Championship on Sunday and will spend the next few days trying to keep his feet on the ground. ‘I’m trying not to think about my place in the game because if you start thinking like that...’ said McIlroy, his voice trailing off.

‘I was happy to be a two-time major champion but now I’ve got four and the only active players who have got more are Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. I’m level with Ernie Els and Raymond Floyd who are both in the Hall of Fame, so it is pretty lofty company already. The next one would be huge to pull off because then I’d be alongside Phil and Seve Ballesteros. It’s too much to think about.’

There’s no rest for Rory. After this week he will be back in America for four weeks and the FedEx Cup play-offs — he is the runaway leader for the $10million bonus. Then it is on to the Ryder Cup in 45 days where he is ready to assume the role of team leader. 

Asked if he thinks he will be a target for the Americans, he replied: ‘I think it’s not only their team who will view me in those terms but my own as well. It’s only my third Ryder Cup but I am ready to be the talisman and drive us forward. I realise I have that responsibility and I am comfortable with it. In my first two I felt out of place offering an opinion but I realise I have a place in the game now that warrants that. I know I can lead this team.

Centre of attention: The in-form Northern Irishman has now won two consecutive majors

‘I don’t know whether seeing my name on the PGA leaderboard affected the other players but you have to think it counted for something, especially after how I have been playing. It is another thing to have in my locker. It was a great feeling to win in a dogfight because I’d never done that before in a major. 

‘I think satisfaction and joy are the two things I am most feeling right now. I said at The Open I was determined to keep going forward. I never thought it would happen in my wildest dreams and I know I will probably never have another summer like it.’

American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson said: ‘I just wish he was on my team. He is making the game look easy — he knows it and the rest know it.’

Leading the way: McIlroy is on target to become on of the game's greatest players following his latest triumph
