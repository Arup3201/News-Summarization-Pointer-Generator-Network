Parents and children in Monroe, Michigan are protesting as a eight-grade teacher remains suspended from his job following a history lesson which included the subject of the use of blackface in entertainment during the 1800s.

Alan Barron, 59, was placed on paid administrative leave two weeks ago after an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School sat in on Barron's lesson about Jim Crow racial segregation laws. As part of the lesson, Barron showed the class a video about the use of blackface by white performers of the time to imitate African Americans.

The administrator objected to the video, and Barron, a teacher for 36 years in Monroe, was suspended. He is currently two weeks shy of his planned retirement.

Parents and students are speaking out about Barron's suspension, many defending his character as well as his choice of lesson plan.

'She was more offended that they stopped the video,' Adrienne Aaron, mother to one of the students in the classroom, told The Monroe News about her daughter's reaction to seeing the video.

'It had nothing to do with racism.' said Aaron, whose husband is African American. 'History is history. We need to educate our kids to see how far we’ve come in America. How is that racism?'

Many other students and parents took to Facebook to voice their dissatisfaction over Barron's suspension. Commenting on the local news' post about the issue, the outcry was nearly unanimous in it's support for Barron.

'We want you back Mr. Barron' wrote Cody Leach, a student of Barron's 
that posted with the hashtag '#freemrbarron'. He also posted a picture 
of a t-shirt made with the hashtag printed on it.

'Wow. So now it's offensive to teach the truth?' wrote Rita Page Thompson, a resident of Ann Arbor, Michigan, in another comment. 'Would the administration have preferred that the subject matter be totally ignored?'

Some residents of Monroe have move forward with voicing their displeasure with Barron's suspension, organizing an event called 'Reinstate Mr. Barron immediately!' The event currently has over 200 people RSVP'd to attend. 

'As a parent of past students of Mr. Barron's, I am appalled with the 
Monroe County school district.' wrote Angela Neill, another resident of Monroe, on the event's page. 'They should be ashamed of themselves. It 
is a sad day when you blemish the record of one of the best teachers 
Monroe has to offer, just before his retirement.'

As a result of his suspension, Barron is barred from attending district functions, which includes a banquet to honor retiring teachers.

The school district would not comment on the issue, a spokesman for the district refusing to confirm that Barron had been suspended and instead saying that he was 'on leave.'
