Two college freshmen from Minnesota were found fatally shot inside a Pine Island home Monday in an apparent murder-suicide, according to police. 

Olmsted County Sheriff's deputies responded to a home in the 6900 block of 100th Street North at around 4pm after getting a call from one of the victims' relatives.

When officers entered a heated shed on the property, they came upon the body of 18-year-old Kayla Jill Koranda. Lying nearby they found Nicholas Roecker, 19, who was clinging to life.

Roecker was rushed to Mayo Clinic Hospitals, where he died a short time later, according to officials. 

Olmsted County Sheriff David Mueller told the Minneapolis Star Tribune a handgun used in the suspected murder-suicide was recovered at the scene.

The 19-year-old victim, who lived in the house with his family, attended the University of Minnesota- Duluth, while Koranda was a student at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis.

Sheriff Mueller told MailOnline over the phone Tuesday that it appears the victims were just friends and not a couple. 

According to a statement from the 
sheriffâ€™s office released to MailOnline this afternoon, the two deceased
 were classmates at Lourdes High School - a Catholic institution in 
Rochester. Koranda and Roecker were also Facebook friends.

Last
 year, Koranda received the Olmsted Medical Center Auxiliary award of 
$1,000 offered to students who wish to pursue careers in health care.

Roecker
 played varsity football for the Lourdes Eagles and was listed on the 
honor roll during his senior year for earning a GPA of 3.5 or higher. 

Scholar: Roecker studied science and engineering the University of Minnesota-Duluth where he enrolled after graduating from Lourdes High School with a GPA over 3.5

Too young: Koranda was also a graduate of Lourdes High School and studied liberal arts at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis

Relationship: Police believe Koranda, pictured here with her family, was just friends with Roecker

The 19-year-old man was a science and engineering major living at Griggs Hall. Koranda studied liberal arts and resided at Middlebrook Hall.

'The depth of their relationship is still not known at this time,' the Sheriffâ€™s Office said in a statement. 'However, it is believed that they were just friends.'

Mueller told the Star Tribune it is believed that Roecker was the one who fired the fatal shots. According to sheriff, Koranda went to visit her friend Monday because he was suffering from depression.
