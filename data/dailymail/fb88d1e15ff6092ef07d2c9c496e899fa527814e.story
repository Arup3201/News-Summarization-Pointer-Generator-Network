Hundreds of British troops will no longer be sent to help with the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq this month, amid fears of further casualties on the battlefield in an election year.

Downing Street were last night said to be worried that significantly stepping up the UK’s military campaign in the Middle East could influence the general election campaign.

Senior officials apparently fear there would be a public backlash if serving UK soldiers were killed while training Iraqi security forces against jihadists.

Not going: British military advisers instruct Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Arbil,  Iraq, in November last year. Hundreds of British troops will no longer be sent to fight Islamic State militants in Iraq this month

Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, announced in December that hundreds of British troops would be sent to Iraq in January in a dramatic escalation of the war on terror.

But in an embarrassing mark of cross-party disarray, the Ministry of Defence yesterday admitted there will be nowhere near that amount sent to the war-torn country within that timescale.

Plans to train the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi security forces to counter threats from roadside bombs and defeat militants are still being ‘scoped’, an MoD spokesman said. 

This was the same line given by the department in early November.

Whitehall sources told the Mail: ‘Downing Street does not want any news of UK troops heading for Iraq overshadowing the election campaign. 

'They are now looking at delaying the training announced by Michael Fallon.’

The MoD was unable to provide any timescale as to when the hundreds of soldiers would be deployed to the battlefield.

It is understood a decision to consider delaying the plans came following a US report into deaths of serving personnel in Iraq.

A source added: ‘The Conservative’s concern about Iraq and the potential for soldiers being killed has been reinforced by the US report which was raised at a recent meeting.’

The US Department of Defense announced late last year that Marine Corporal Jordan L Spears had died while taking part in Operation Inherent Resolve – the codename given to the military campaign against Islamic State.

The 21-year-old was lost at sea after the MV-22 Osprey he was in lost power shortly after take-off from the USS Makin Island in October.

The plane was operating in support of the mission in Iraq and Syria, Navy officials said at the time. Days later, Lance Corporal Sean P Neal, 19, died in a ‘non-combat related incident’ in Baghdad.

His death was described as the first death of an American service member in the fight against Islamic State.

On Monday, Defense Department spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said US soldiers and Marines at Al Asad air base in western Iraq had been coming under ‘regular’ mortar fire from insurgent forces.

Mr Fallon announced in December that hundreds of British service personnel would be training Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamist jihadists as soon as this month.

A ‘force protection’ deployment of combat-ready soldiers was also expected to be sent to defend the military training teams, who would be based at four US bases inside Iraq, Mr Fallon said.

The new mission would mark the first significant deployment of ground forces since the last British troops withdrew from Iraq three years ago.

Soldiers were set to teach the Iraqi army vital skills, such as how to counter deadly roadside bombs, in a mission which was likely to lead to claims of ‘mission creep’.

He announced: ‘Our role now, apart from the air strikes, is increasingly going to be on training.

‘Particularly, a key skill we are going to be helping with its counter-IED, particularly vehicle explosive devices which the Iraqi army hasn’t come across for some time, they don’t know how to handle, they haven’t got the kit or the bomb disposal people to deal with it.

‘So the training we are going to be offering in January will be in infantry skills and some of the basics but particularly on how you deal with IEDs, given all the lessons we have learnt from Afghanistan.’

A handful of British trainers have already been deployed to Iraq to work with the Kurdish and Iraqi security forces.

But the move signified Britain’s commitment to a ‘large-scale venture’ in which US-led training programmes are set to be rolled out to soldiers fighting against militants taking over swathes of the country.

They were expected to join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale.

It is understood they were to include soldiers from the 2nd battalion Parachute Regiment, who would protect the training teams.

Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters.

British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – were asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge.

The announcement by Mr Fallon came after the UK and other allies agreed to support the initiative, which will be spearheaded by 3,500 US troops.

The US-led Coalition Training Force was set to include 1,500 troops from Britain, France, Australia and Germany who would train Kurdish and Iraqi troops at the bases in Baghdad and Erbil.

An MoD spokesman said the details had not been finalised but the Government remained fully committed to playing an ‘active role’ in the international coalition to defeat Islamic State.

A spokesman said: ‘The National Security Council agreed that we should do further work to scope the additional assistance we could offer to the Iraqi military. 

'As the Defence Secretary has made clear, details have not been finalised. At this stage no firm decisions have been made.’
