When James Richards decided to ask his partner of 13 years to marry him, he wanted it to be an extra special occasion.

So the romantic 35-year-old, from Swansea, South Wales, decided to aim high - and attempted to enlist the help of his favourite pop star.

James wrote to Paloma Faith, contacting her through her Facebook page, to ask if she would lend a hand popping the question to his other half Chris Howells. 

Chris (right) was on a train home when he received the message, he says he was overwhelmed but immediately said yes to partner James (left)

But he never expected a response and was shocked when the Stone Cold Sober singer recorded a personal message for Chris, 42.

And James' efforts paid off with his Chris taking one look at the platinum-selling singer's clip and saying: 'Yes!'

In the intimate video, Paloma leans in to the camera and says: 'Hi Chris, it's Paloma Faith. I've got a little secret for you.

Paloma points out that the couple have been together for 13 years and it is about time that they get married

'James, your boyfriend thinks that you've been together for 13 years now and it's about time that he asked you to marry him.

'I think you should say yes. Thirteen years is kind of a given. Anyway, good luck to you both. Bye.'

The red-headed singer ends the 30-second black and white clip by blowing a kiss down the lens.

Designer James said: 'I was really shocked.

'When I got in touch asking for her help I had been expecting a tweet or Facebook status not a live recording!'

Make-up artist Chris, 42, saw the video when he was travelling home from Birmingham by train.

He added: 'I was totally overwhelmed, but obviously I said yes!' 

Paloma tells Chris that she thinks he should say yes to the proposal before wishing them both luck 

When James contacted the singer via Facebook he had only expected a tweet or a status not a personally recorded message
