Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer believes the use of technology in football will go far beyond the use of merely goal-line cameras in the future.

The Bayern Munich honorary president thinks there will be a time when referees are a thing of the past, and will subsequently be replaced by drones hovering all over the pitch.

Speaking to Sky90, Beckenbauer - who won the World Cup as a player and manager with West Germany - said: 'We are living in a century that's all about technology. We all know that it doesn't end with goal-line technology.

'At some point, we won't even need a referee any more. Drones will be keeping an eye on whatever happens on the pitch at some point.

'I genuinely think this is the future. I won't be alive when it happens, though, so it's up to other people to fight it.

'This isn't something that's been discussed at FIFA. It's just a personal idea of mine.'
