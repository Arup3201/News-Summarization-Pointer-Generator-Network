The brute force of Mixed Martial Arts was on show on Monday night when Vitor Nobrega fought Ireland's Philip Mulpeter for the International Pro Combat welterweight title.

Defending champion Nobrega unleashed a devastating kick to Mulpeter's side which sent a ripple through the fighter's body, captured perfectly by a photographer.

Nobrega buried his left foot into Mulpeter's body, creating a dent as the picture was taken - the effect of the contact made the more dramatic as it skewed the skull tattoo emblazoned on his back.
