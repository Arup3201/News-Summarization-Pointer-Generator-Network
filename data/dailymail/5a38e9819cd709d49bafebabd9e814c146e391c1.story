Chris Froome and his team at Sky have had their ethics questioned by one of the leading anti-doping advocates in cycling on the eve of the Tour de France.

In a fascinating interview with Sportsmail, Christophe Bassons also warns that cycling’s rejection of Lance Armstrong could have dire consequences.

‘I don’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling, because I think it is possible,’ said the French former professional rider.

Ethics: Team Sky have come under-fire from Bassons who asks himself 'a lot of questions'

Bassons was a key adversary of Armstrong and he argues that Sky’s use of TUEs (therapeutic user exemption certificate) is no different to using the blood-boosting drug EPO.

Speaking in Leeds on Friday to promote his updated autobiography - ‘A Clean Break’ - Bassons said it was wrong for Froome to race in April’s Tour de Romandie using a TUE for an asthma medication.

Froome was not in breach of UCI or WADA rules but Bassons thinks Team Sky and Froome have been exposed compromising their principles.

‘Doping is about eliminating all obstacles to win a race,’ said Bassons.

‘I ask myself a lot of questions about Team Sky. I have the impression that they talk a lot and say a lot of things because they don't want to talk about other things.

‘The fact is Froome has shown his mentality by taking this product. He had a problem, he was ill and he took this product. He eliminated the obstacle to him winning.

‘It's not that different from taking EPO because you're tired and your haematocrit is low. Just because it's legal, it comes down to the same mentality.

‘Armstrong said years ago: “I've been tested 500 times and never tested positive.” That's the same mentality guys have got today. They just don't want to test positive.

‘It's not about where the authorities draw the line, because people thinking about that are also only thinking the priority is not to test positive.

‘My dad was a bricklayer. If he was ill he wouldn't take a drug so he could carry on, he'd go home and rest. There seems to be this obligation with Sky to perform at any cost. That worries me.’

As a rider Bassons earned the nickname ‘Mr Clean’ because of his refusal to dope, even though he was a member of the Festina team that was busted for carrying doping products in a team car just before the start of the 1998 Tour.

A year later he would write a newspaper column claiming the peloton was riddled with drug cheats, leading to an infamous confrontation with Armstrong during the race. Two years later he retired from cycling disillusioned.

A courageous man who for the last 10 years has worked in anti-doping in his native France - he tries to educate young athletes against the dangers of drugs in sport - Bassons said on Friday he could see unfavourable comparisons between Team Sky and the US Postal Service team that dominated the Tour under the leadership of Armstrong.

Sky have won the last two Tours under Sir Bradley Wiggins and then Froome, with the latter favourite to win the race for a second time this year.

‘What's also true is Sky have definitely gone against a lot of received knowledge in the sport,’ he said. ‘There were a lot of things we thought weren't possible and they've shown that they are possible.

‘They have a collective force like US Postal had. They communicate with people like US Postal did and they seem to produce riders who don't have any muscles and are very powerful.

‘Twenty years ago, almost, it was Festina, 10 years later it was Armstrong. I don't want to say that in the next few years Froome is going to be the next big scandal, but what they ought to do if they've got nothing to hide is communicate differently and stop communicating in that way, like US Postal used to do.’

Team Sky insisted earlier this week that it abided by the rules. In Friday's press conference, Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford said: ‘We set out to try to win this race with a British rider and ride clean and we've achieved that.

‘We're a clean team, we play by the rules. We are happy that WADA is happy with us and we are happy that the UCI is happy with us.’

Basson also argued that it was wrong that a former doper, Bjarne Riis, is a team principal for Tinkoff Saxo in this year’s race.

‘In 1999 Armstrong was far from alone in doping,’ he said. 'Everyone was doing it. It’d not acceptable that people like Bjarne Riis are still in the sport when we are trying to restore the credibility of cycling.

'Look at Laurent Jalabert. We know now he was a doper and yet he is working as a cycling commentator on French television, on a public channel I pay for with my television licence. I am paying for Laurent Jalabert.’

Questionable? Tinkoff Saxo team principal Bjarne Riis is a former doper in cycling

Bassons met up with Armstrong in Paris last December, giving the American the opportunity to apologise for the way he had treated him.

‘I compare the 1999 Armstrong to the 2013 Armstrong and they were two completely different men,’ said Bassons.

‘I saw a very tired man. He couldn’t look you in the eye. In 1999 he never dropped his gaze. Now he was scratching the table. He was nervous. He drank two glasses of Vodka before the interview and he drank afterwards as well.

‘I work in anti-doping with young people and I don’t always agree with the message the anti-doping bodies put out; about this war on drugs that is all about protecting people’s health. Because the war on drugs quite clearly hasn’t protected everyone’s health.

‘Frank Vandenbroucke, Jose Maria Jimenez, Marco Pantani, Philippe Gaumont, they’re not dead because of doping. They are dead because of the way they were rejected.

Different: A 'nervous' Armstrong 'drank two glasses of Vodka before the interview' claims Bassons

‘Maybe Armstrong is stronger than I imagine but I don’t want to hear that he has been found hanging from a ceiling, because I think it is possible.

‘In 1999 most riders were using drugs and others would have done the same thing as him. They would have acted in the same way and created the same system around them but they weren’t as strong and as intelligent as him.

‘By creating that system he created a lot of bitterness towards himself and now people are jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make themselves look good by condemning him.

‘But they are not assuming responsibility for their actions and what they did at the time.’

The UCI have ordered an independent inquiry into cycling’s doping past - CIRC - in the wake of the Armstrong revelations of last year.   

Bassons is unimpressed. ‘I haven’t spoken to CIRC,’ he said. ‘Every 10 years or so cycling has something like this. We had Festina in 98 and then the Armstrong affair. Now we have this thing with Froome and the TUEs, and it seems like WADA and the UCI might have facilitated something that shouldn’t have happened. We should be looking at the present.

'I don’t like talking about the past, even though I am here, because the focus needs to be on the present and what is happening now. That’s where we should be focusing our energy.

‘It’s ridiculous we are focusing our energy on something that happened 10 years ago when Bjarne Riis is still the manager of a team.

‘It is harder to dope these days because the tests are much more sensitive. But the biological passport is a problem. It’s a shield everyone hides behind but it has good things and bad things.

‘Riders can take microdoses of drugs like EPO. You are not tested between 9pm and 6am and if you take a microdose of EPO at 9.01 pm it will not be detectable by 6am the next morning. I know the mentality hasn’t changed in cycling.’
