Captured on camera: A childcare worker is facing a battery charge after being caught on CCTV allegedly kicking a 20-month-old boy in the face

Wrong move: Alexis J. Wilson-Britten, 22, a teacher at a former Kids R Kids day care center in Riverdale, Georgia, was arrested on Friday after the surveillance footage surfaced

Dismissed: The clip, which has now been made public, shows her apparently pushing pupil Jayden Reece away with her foot as he approaches her with a toy held in his hands

He appears to hold the object up to protect himself from the blow.

Jayden is the son of fellow day care worker and teacher, Kimberly Johnson.

She told CBS46 that she became concerned about the care being provided at the center after her other son, Ayden - Jayden's twin brother - came home from  on Thursday with a fractured arm.

Ayden apparently injured himself in the playground but Wilson-Britten had not reported it to administrators.

After Johnson informed the daycare center manager of  the teacher’s 'poor performance' her actions were reviewed.

It was then that the 'kicking' incident came to light on surveillance video.

Clayton County Georgia Police spokeswoman JaQuitta Williams told WSB-TV that Wilson-Britten performed the same action 'not once, but twice' although the released footage does not show the second strike.

Facing charges: Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday

Robert Phelps, the owner of the daycare center, said Wilson-Britten was going to be fired the day she allegedly kicked Jayden.

Her dismissal was linked to a prior case when she allegedly taped a pacifier to another toddler's mouth to stop her from crying.

Police said Jayden wasn't injured in the incident, but they are investigating the injury to Ayden.

Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday.

The incident remains under investigation. A spokesperson who has rights to the Kids R Kids franchise said it terminated its agreement with the location in Riverdale more than a year ago and is not associated with the chain.
