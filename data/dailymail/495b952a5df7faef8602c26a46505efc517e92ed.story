Barbara Walters has weighed in on 
disgraced Clippers owner Donald Sterling's health after his estranged 
wife said that she thinks he has dementia.

'I won't use the word dementia- I'm not a doctor,' Walters said on Good Morning America today.

'I did find him very vague and confused by certain things so I could see that someone could get that impression.'

Her opinion: Barbara Walters was meant to interview Sterling alongside his allege mistress but he stormed out

Change of plans: Donald Sterling was seen leaving the Four Season in Los Angeles when Walters' interview with Stiviano was happening on May 2

Walters most recently interviewed Sterling's estranged wife Shelly, but she also previously met with Donald himself.

More
 than a week ago, the newswoman was set to interview both Donald 
Sterling and his alleged mistress V. Stiviano, but only ended up 
interviewing Stiviano.

Reports surfaced later that Sterling did show up to the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, but didn't go to the suite for the interview.

There
 were reports from onlookers in one of the elevators who said that 
Sterling was screaming at Stiviano and calling her a 'media whore'.

For
 Shelly's part, she drew on the fact that when she asked him about the 
racist recording, her 81-year-old estranged husband didn't seem to 
remember making the remarks.

She
 told Walters that when she asked Donald about the recordings, he said: 
'I don't remember saying that. I don't remember ever saying those 
things.'

'I said, "Well, this is the tape." And he says, "Hmm. I don't remember it." That's when I thought he had dementia.'

Sterling's health is not a new issue to be brought into the scandal, as it was earlier reported that he had prostate cancer, though Shelly Sterling did not talk about her estranged husband's health any further.

Solo: Donald Sterling was scheduled to sit with V. Stiviano during her 20/20 interview but he allegedly yelled at her and stormed out before the cameras started rolling

When asked why they hadn't divorced in spite of the fact that they have been estranged for more than a year, she gave no clear answer, saying only that in spite of the fact that sheÂ  is 'very strong' normally, she was 'very weak' in her marriage.

'For
 the last 20 years, I've been seeing attorneys for a divorce,' she told 
Barbara Walters. 'In fact, I have here, I just filed, I was going to 
file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce.'

Shelly Sterling says the decision to wait on making the request official was made by her financial advisor.

'Not now,' she recalled him saying before admitting that 'eventually I am going to [divorce him].'

Her connection to her husband of more than 60 years is important at this time because she owns half of the basketball team and while her husband has been banned from the NBA.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he hopes to force Sterling to sell the team he has owned since 1981, but he has also indicated that he does not want Shelly to have an ownership role in his place.

She plans to fight that vigorously, telling Walters that she wants to keep her half of the team.

'I will fight their decision,' she said.

'(The team) means a lot (to me). I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times. And it's my passion and I love it and it's my legacy to my family.'
