A man sent to prison for 25 years for sexually assaulting a child has been sentenced to another 40 for hiring a hit man to kill the prosecutor in his case.

Edward Carreon, 32, of Chicago, was convicted earlier this year for solicitation of murder for hire after he planned to kill the pregnant lawyer who has handling the child molestation case against him.

Carreon, who planned to pay hit man 'Marcus' when he got out of prison, had received the name of an alleged assassin from a fellow prison inmate while awaiting sentencing for his 2011 assault.

Convicted child molester Edward Carreon, 32, was sentenced to 40 additional years in jail after conspiring to hire a hit man and kill the woman prosecuting his sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl

Correspondence between Correan and an undercover officer who went by the name Marcus reveals that the prisoner wanted to pay $25,000 for the prosecutor to be murdered with 'two shots to the head'

However, the call he made from jail to was actually to an undercover sheriff's department official who he offered $25,000 for the murder.

'Two shots to the head is what I want,' Carreon wrote to the officer in a early 2013 letter, according to WGN. 

Carreon signed the letter 'Love Eddie' and talked about Marcus 'doing his homework' in finding the prosecutor.

Profanity- laced jailhouse conversations between the two were also recorded, during which Carreon said that he wanted the evidence used against him to be destroyed. 

Over the course of multiple meetings in early 2013, he also identified the prosecutor, who has not been named by media reports, in photos.

Correan, who met with the undercover officer multiple times in early 2013 before his sentencing, signed his letter 'Love Eddie'

The child molester, who was convicted in 2013 of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old multiple times, used to live two blocks from an elementary school

'While this was an extremely alarming threat to the safety of one of my assistant state’s attorneys, we also consider it a threat to the integrity of our entire criminal justice system, so we are extremely grateful for this verdict,' Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement. 

The targeted prosecutor has said that the plot rattled her and her entire family.

She is still working for the attorney's office. 

Carreon was given 25 years for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl on numerous occasions in 2011 and then trying to convince her that the relationship was consensual after she turned 13.

He formerly lived in the Brighton Park area of Chicago two blocks from an elementary school, according to the Chicago Tribune. 

If he serves all of his terms, Carreon will not get out of jail until he's 97.

He has two previous convictions of domestic battery against his children's mother.
