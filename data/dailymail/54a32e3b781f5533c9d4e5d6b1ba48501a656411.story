A Florida woman accused of stabbing her boyfriend to death told police she did it because he 'put a curse on her.'

Amanda Lopez, 26, of Tampa told police that her 57-year-old ex-boyfriend Larry Lee Fryer had 'done something to her' and that the only way to free herself from under his malicious spell was to 'kill him.'

Lopez was arrested on Monday and charged with first-degree murder and was taken to Osceola County jail on Tuesday without bond.

Under his spell: Amanda Lopez, 26, told police when she was arrested on Monday that she 'stabbed her ex-boyfriend because he put a curse on her' and she sought to end it 

News 13 reports that Lopez told investigators she plotted to kill Fryer for over a year.

Fryer was discovered with stab wounds in an apartment on Lake Trivolia Boulevard after he called 911 shortly after the assault.

'Hurry,' Fryer said breathlessly over the phone to 911.

'What's wrong,' said the 911 operator.

'I've been stabbed,' he responded with just minutes of life to spare.

'Sir, who stabbed you? said the operator before sending authorities to the bloody scene.

Fryer was taken to the hospital where he later died. An autopsy report showed the Fryer had been stabbed eight times

A neighbor of Fryer's said that anything is possible--even black magic.

He speculated that perhaps Lopez was really possessed by someone or maybe that she just wanted to murder someone.

'It could be anything,' said Fryers neighbor Joey Stuart.

'It could be a cover-up that she did want to murder somebody or it could be that she really was possessed by someone.'

Stuart added that some people believe in demons and demonic possessions but that they can seek help for it.
