AÂ  'lynch mob' called for the death penalty against three men accused of raping a woman for more than an hour before throwing her from a moving bus were brought to court.

Roads and railways have been closed in New Delhi today as police try to regain control after days of protest and pitched battles between police and demonstrators.

Today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm and vowed to get justice for the 'monstrous crime'.

Lock down: Authorities shut down roads in the heart of India's capital to try to end the week-long protests

Bus driver Ram Singh, 36,
 fruit seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and gym helper Vinay Sharma, 20, are 
accused of gang-raping and beating the 23-year-old student on December 
16.

Eight days later she remains in a critical condition and doctors said she is still on respiratory support.

The
 three suspects were brought to Saket court yesterday where hundreds of 
protesters gathered to 'thrash the brutes' with others calling for them 
to be hanged.

Some even tried to barge into the court but they were repelled by police.

The suspects, who were remanded at Tihar jail until January 6, refused to do a identification parade.

Sharma
 told the court: 'We do not want to undergo (the parade) because we have
 committed a heinous crime. We should be hanged for this.'

Another suspect, Akshay Thakur was remanded in judicial custody on Saturday night.

Mukesh Singh, the brother of Ram Singh, has already been picked out in an identification parade by the male friend of the victim.

A sixth suspect is under Juvenile Justice Board as he is a minor and will take part in the identification parade on Monday.

During days of protests, more than 100 people and about 60 officers have been hurt.

Police used batons, teargas and water cannon to try and disperse the demonstrators.

Candle-light vigils have also taken place in other Indian cities.

The demonstrations are the biggest New Delhi has seen since the 2011 protests against corruption.

Today, police barricaded roads 
leading to India Gate, which has been the focus of protests and many 
metro rail stations were also closed, crippling movement around the city
 of 16million.

The Government has faced criticism for the use of force used against protesters, the failure to implement laws to protect women in India's 'rape capital' and for how slow it has been to respond to the strength of feeling.

Prime Minister Singh said in a televised address: 'I appeal to all concerned citizens to
 maintain peace and calm. I assure you we will make all possible efforts
 to ensure security and safety of women in this country.'

He has come under fire for remaining largely silent since the rape.

He 
issued a statement for the first time on Sunday, a week after the crime.

Sonia Gandhi, chief of the ruling Congress Party, has met some of the 
protesters to hear their demands.

Social activist Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre
 for Social Research in Delhi said: 'There is a
 huge amount of anger. People are deeply upset that despite so many 
incidents there has not been much response from the state and the 
government.'

Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury said: 'People are not reacting to just one rape case. They are reacting to the general malaise, the frustration with the leadership. There is a feeling that the leadership is completely disconnected.'

The protests overshadowed an official visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin and disrupted his schedule.

New Delhi has the highest number of sex crimes among India's major cities, with a rape reported on average every 18 hours, according to police figures.

A global poll by Thomson Reuters Foundation in June found that India was the worst place in the world to be a woman because of high rates of infanticide, child marriage and slavery.

Since last week's rape, the authorities have promised better police patrolling to ensure safety for women returning from work and entertainment districts, more buses at night, and fast-track courts for swift verdicts on cases of rape and sexual assaults.

Reported rape cases in India have increased by 9.2 percent to 24,206 cases in 2011 from 22,172 the previous year, according to the National Crime Record Bureau,

'This is not about that one rape,' said trainee fashion designer Shruti Sharma, 24, at a protest today.

'This is about how crime is rampant in our cities. We are angry at the government for not ensuring the safety of its citizens. The judiciary is slow. Cases take too long.'
