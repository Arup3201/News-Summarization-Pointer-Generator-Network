A terrified teenage couple were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels.

Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and her boyfriend Ged Sykes, 18, were checking out of their five-star hotel in Krakow, Poland, when staff demanded £41 to pay for the towels, which were lightly marked with mud.

The young couple, who were on holiday earlier this month for Ged’s 18th birthday, said the situation escalated when they had no money to pay for them and staff called two 'burly' armed police officers who demanded their passports.

Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and Ged Sykes, 18, were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels

Francesca, an A-level student, said: 'I was absolutely petrified. Our flight was two hours away and I thought I was going to be arrested or shot.

'We had used the towels to lie on when we visited a park and they were very lightly marked with soil.

'We had handed them in four days before we were leaving so the hotel could clean them but staff waited until we were getting picked up to be taken to the airport before they raised an issue.

'They told us they were stained but you could see they hadn’t even tried to wash them.

'We had no money left and couldn’t pay so they called the police.

The teenage couple had used the towels to lie on during a visit to a park while on their holiday in Krakow  

'Two big officers arrived straight away carrying guns and blocked the exit so we were trapped in the hotel.

'They didn’t speak any English so we couldn’t explain our side of things and they just kept demanding our passports.

'They took them from us and then our taxi to the airport couldn’t wait for us anymore and drove off.

The couple were terrified when hotel staff called the police and demanded they hand over their passports. Miss Stefanyszyn feared they would miss their flight home and be arrested

'I was crying my eyes out. I thought we were going to be arrested or stranded in Poland.

'I’d never been on holiday without my parents before and I just didn’t know what to do.'

Francesca phoned her father Taras, 49, who paid the 200 Zloty over the phone with his credit card.

Mr Stefanyszyn had booked the trip for the pair, paying for flights, a five-night stay at the Crown Piast Hotel and transfers, as a present for Ged’s birthday.

He said: 'It was early in the morning and I got a very distressed phone call from Fran.

'She had never been away on her own before and she was in tears.

'She felt very threatened by the two burly police officers who had turned up armed with guns and truncheons.

'I asked to speak to the manager but they were really aggressive with me on the phone and said he wasn’t around.

'If I hadn’t been able to pay over the phone they would probably have been arrested.

'There were no niceties and they were bang out of order.

'Fran and Ged brought the towels home with them for us to see and they weren’t even stained.

'They just had a few marks on them so I couldn’t believe how they had reacted. 

The couple were staying in the five star Crown Piast Hotel in Krakow, as part of a birthday gift to Mr Sykes from his girlfriend's father, Taras Stefanyszyn

'They hadn’t even attempted to clean them.

'I think they saw two kids and thought they could get more money from them.

'It’s such a shame because I suggested Krakow when they were deciding where to go. I love the place and thought it would be a really safe place for them to go.'

The couple only just managed to catch their flight home thanks to the intervention of Francesca’s father and washed the towels when they arrived home.

It was the couple's first holiday alone together to celebrate Mr Sykes's 18th birthday

Francesca, who is of Ukrainian and Russian descent, said: 'All of the marks came out with just one wash.

'The whole thing was a horrible experience and it means I will be really cautious when I next go on holiday.

'I didn’t know how to deal with what happened and now I’m wary at the thought of travelling anywhere.

'I couldn’t stop crying and I dread to think about what would have happened if my dad hadn’t answered his phone.'

Taras says he has contacted the hotel since the incident to complain but they have refused to apologise.

A spokesman for the hotel said the matter was very important to them and that they would investigate it before responding properly.
