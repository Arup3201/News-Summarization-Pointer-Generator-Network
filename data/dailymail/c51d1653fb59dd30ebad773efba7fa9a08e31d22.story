BBC bosses caused consternation after they invited Mr Galloway onto the panel in Finchley, which has the largest Jewish community of any parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom. 

Last year MP Mr Galloway was interviewed by police on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after he declared his Bradford constituency was an 'Israel-free' zone. 

He previously refused to debate with a student at Oxford University because he was Israeli. 

Tensions boiled over when Question Time audience member Gabriel Rosen asked him: 'Why is anti-Semitism rising in the UK and does a certain member of the panel bear some responsibility?'

As Mr Galloway was about to answer others then shouted: 'You're not welcome here' and called him 'scum'.

Mr Galloway said: 'Am I on trial here? Zionism and Israel are different things from Judaism and Jewishness.

'Anti-Semitism is a foul form of racism that in the 1930s led to the Holocaust. If I had been born then I would have been the first in the line in the recruitment office to fight fascism'. 

Another audience member yelled: 'You support Hezbollah' and Mr Galloway was accused of supporting violence against Jews.

He told the crowd: 'You are in favour of some political violence but against other political violence. You're in favour of freedom of speech for some people, but not for others'.

He added: 'You will not stop me speaking however much you shout' and told them: 'You be the lions, I'll be Daniel'.

Other guests on the programme included Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, her shadow counterpart Tristram Hunt and Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland, 

Britain's Jewish community had reacted with fury to the decision to have him on the show.

Mike Freer, the Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said the invitation was 'deliberately provocative'. He added: 'The BBC can't have done it by accident.

'Given what's going on in the world it is a slap in the face for the local community. It lacks sensitivity.'

Mr Freer and the Jewish Leadership Council, which brings together major Jewish organisations, wrote to the BBC challenging the decision, and asked whether it is a 'responsible move'.

The Community Security Trust, a charity which monitors anti-Semitism and organises security for schools and synagogues said: 'If the BBC didn't understand the strength of feeling in the community about George Galloway, I think they understand it now.'

Mr Galloway was thrown out of the Labour party in 2003 but made a comeback with the Respect party in 2005 in East London. He returned to Westminster in March 2012 after winning the seat of Bradford East in a by-election.

He was interviewed by West Yorkshire Police last August after saying at an event, which was filmed: 'We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone. We don't want any Israeli goods; we don't want any Israeli services; we don't want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college.

'We don't even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so. We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel - and you have to do the same.' 

In November 2012, during an anti-Israeli demonstration in his Bradford constituency, he told those present: 'We do not hate Jews. We hate Zionism, we hate Israel, we hate murder and injustice.' 

The Question Time controversy centred around a question that one audience member asked about a rise in anti-Semitism in the UK.

But the question also included a reference to the MP for Bradford West bearing some responsibility for this rise, an inclusion he said that had not been agreed beforehand.

The anti-war politician said the host David Dimbleby later apologised to him for this, but it represented what he said was a set-up within the BBC.

'A lot of people are very unhappy about it as it was a set-up,' he said.

'It was very poorly chaired by a man I admire but who let himself down immensely. It showed the opposition in a very bad light and I don't know who was advising them.

'It is defamatory and worse and it was not the question that was asked. The question that was tabled and agreed was not the question that was asked.

'He added his own words and David Dimbleby should have stopped and re-shot that question, as it's not a live show.

'David Dimbleby apologised to me afterwards for the man adding on that bit, but he should have made it clear to the audience that this trick had been played and not just apologise afterwards.

'To accuse a parliamentarian of 27 years of being responsible for a spike in anti-Semitism is totally ludicrous.'

Mr Galloway also took issue with the make-up of the audience, saying there was not a single Muslim among them, despite there being many in the borough where it was filmed.

Fellow panel member Jonathan Freedland also did not escape his ire, as he said he had stoked the fires and for that he would never forgive him.

'There was not a single Muslim person in the audience even though there are 50,000 Muslims in the borough,' he said.

'Jonathan Freedland was the prosecutor in chief, he lit the touch paper and then smugly retired and for that I will never forgive him.

'Any anti-Semitic attack of any kind is utterly despicable but there are at least ten times the number of attacks on mosques. 

'Mr Freedland claimed there had been 1,000 attacks on Jews but there have actually been 84.

'The impression was given that people are roaming around the UK looking for Jews to attack but far more people are walking around Britain looking for Muslims.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'Question Time invites panellists who reflect a significant range of opinions on a number of different topics. 

'Whilst Mr Galloway's views are entirely his own, as an MP he has a right to appear on the programme and has done so previously. 

'Subjects for discussion are chosen by our audience ahead of each show and this edition of Question Time will be no different.' 

The BBC later said in a statement: 'We are satisfied the programme was conducted appropriately and fairly.

'Each week Question Time aims to have an audience that reflects the ethnic make-up of the area where we are filming, as well as being politically balanced.

'This week's audience was no different and included people from a range of different faiths.'
