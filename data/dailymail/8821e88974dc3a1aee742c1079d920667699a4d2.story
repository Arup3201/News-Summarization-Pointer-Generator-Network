Police say 40-year-old Clinton D. Inabnitt was waiting for Stanziano and that witnesses described him wordlessly shooting the attorney.

Inabnitt is charged with murder.

A police citation says Inabnitt told 
officers that he shot Stanziano because the attorney declined to help 
him with a problem Thursday night and laughed at him.

 Police Department spokesman Shannon Smith declined to describe the 
problem but said Stanziano would not have been able to help.

According to an arrest citation reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader, Inabnitt later admitted to being angry not because Stanziano denied him help but because he laughed at him.

The accused murderer lives in an apartment directly across the street from the attorney's office.

Witnesses have told police them the man had been contact with Stanziano on Thursday evening and had previously threatened the attorney

Inabnitt allegedly fired seven shots from a 9mm pistol at him from less than 15 feet away as Stanziano arrived for work.

Stanziano was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:12 a.m.

Among Stanziano's high profile cases was an acquittal last year for a Wayne County man accused of murdering his 20-month-old son after the boy drank drain cleaner in a mobile home that was host to a meth production operation.
