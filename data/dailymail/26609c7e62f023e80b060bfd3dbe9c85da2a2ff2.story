Fewer children are walking to school than a decade ago, despite schemes to encourage families to reduce their reliance on cars.

Campaigners have described the decline as a ‘national scandal’ as the rate of obesity among children rises.

An analysis of the latest Government figures shows just 41 per cent of children in England walked to school last year compared with 44 per cent ten years earlier – a total drop of 300,000 pupils.

National scandal: Fewer children are walking to school than ten years ago, as obesity rates soar among young

Pupils were least likely to walk to school in London, where just 36 per cent of children went on foot, followed by 39 per cent in the South East.

Campaigners said parents were still worried about their children’s safety on busy and congested roads.

Joe Irvin, chief executive for Living Streets, a charity supporting pedestrians, said: ‘It’s a national scandal that fewer than half of our children now walk to school.

‘Traffic congestion is a major deterrent to parents allowing their children to walk to school so many choose to drive their children, adding to the problem of stressful, congested areas around schools and unwittingly becoming part of the rising issue of safety outside the school gates.

‘We need to prioritise our children not traffic and we’re calling on the Government to develop a coherent action plan for sustainable school travel which would enable our children to walk to school safely and easily.

‘Over the next 10 years, pupil numbers are going to explode and without action now, our streets are will grind to a halt and children’s health will be put at risk.

‘Making our streets safer for children not only benefits their health today, but safeguards their wellbeing in the future. The time has come for the Government to commit to putting pupils first.’

Pupils instead tend to travel to school in the car or on buses. In most areas, just one per cent of pupils cycle to lessons.
