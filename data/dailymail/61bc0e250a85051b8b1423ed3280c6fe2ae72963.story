Two American tourists have been arrested for carving initials into the Colosseum in Rome.

Before they were spotted, the women, 21 and 25, were able to carve a J and an N into a brick wall on the first floor of the west side of the Colosseum.

After carving the eight-inch high letters, the women posed together for a selfie. 

The women, just two of six million tourists that flock to the Colosseum every year, used a coin to engrave the letters, La Stampa reported.

They are said to have broken away from their tour group before - but other tourists saw what had happened and alerted security.

Police charged the women with 'aggravated damage on building of historical and artistic interest', according to Republica. 

After they were caught, the women  apologized to Piazza Dante police and Captain Lorenzo Iacobone.

They said: 'We apologize for what we did. We regret it but we did not imagine it was something so serious. 

'We'll remember for a lifetime.'  

According to the Guardian, the section damaged dates back to the 1800s - a key period of restoration.

A spokesman for the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome is quoted as saying: 'It’s not an original wall but it’s nevertheless antique.'

With approximately six million visitors to the Colosseum each year and ever-increasing staff cuts, policing the site has become a major problem.

Sadly many of the stones bear the unsightly engravings of tourists keen to leave their mark.

The Californians’ lawbreaking comes little over three months after a Russian tourist was caught carving a 25cm letter into the Colosseum. The 42-year-old was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a €20,000 fine, although owing to a lack of funds he has not paid the penalty.

He was said to be the fifth tourist seen defacing the Colosseum in 2014. A father and son from Australia and teenagers from Brazil and Canada were also caught out last year. 

Built in the first century CE, the Colosseum is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site.

In order to make the  UNESCO list, a site must have a special cultural or physical significance.

The Colosseum, which is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, was named after a colossal statue that once stood nearby.

The structure 'accommodated games of great popular appeal, such as hunts and gladiatorial fights' until the end of the Ancient Age, according to the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. 

The organization adds: 'The building was, and still is today, a show in itself. 

'In fact, it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators.'
