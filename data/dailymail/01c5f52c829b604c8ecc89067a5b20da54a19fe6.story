British stylist Gok Wan has taught women all over the world how to look good naked, but has now found himself in hot water down under by trying to get ladies to cover up.

Appearing in an Australian TV commercial for bras from clothing giant Target, the bespectacled fashion guru generated viewer complaints to the Advertising Standards Bureau for referring to breasts as 'bangers' and 'assets', which some people found 'offensive' and 'degrading'.

Despite complaints, however, the ASB decided there was no breach of code, commenting that the advert's overall tone was 'positive and lighthearted' and
intended to draw attention to the importance of 
buying the correct bra size, according to Karen Collier of the Herald Sun.

Gok Wan is, despite being gay, no stranger to the female breast, thanks to his television show in which he teaches women how to look good naked

On the advert, Wan appears dancing through the Target store with several topless women, saying: 'Hi, I'm Gok Wan at Target, and I'm all about your assets, but 85 per cent of you do not know your true bra size... but we've got bra fitters in every store, so there's no excuse: your bangers will never feel more loved.'

Critics complained the advert was demeaning and compared women to meat, while others were disappointed that the campaign featured a gay man.

One said : 'I have never called, or even heard another woman, or man for 
that matter, refer to women's breasts as bangers, bangers are a slang 
term for a sausage, I do not want my breast referred to as meat.'

But Target said the 'playful' ad stood parallel with brand values: 'It
contains words used in common parlance, such as 'assets' to encourage 
women to think about themselves in positive terms.

'The
term 'bangers' is used in wry acceptance that not everyone thinks about
their breasts in positive terms. It is an irreverent term of 
affection.'

Speaking about their choice of star for the campaign, they commented on Wan: 'He feels good about who he is as he is. He is playfully irreverent, 
colourful and fun. He has a great capacity for making other people feel 
good about themselves too.

'Target
strongly believes that a person's sexuality is irrelevant to their 
worth as a person. Target makes no apology for using a gay man in its 
advertising.'

Despite complaints about Gok Wan's use of the word 'bangers', the ASB decided there was no breach of code, commenting that the advert's overall tone was 'positive and lighthearted'

The ASB said: 'The
board considered the term 'bangers' and recognised that some members of
the community may be offended by the reference to women's breasts as 
bangers.

'The 
board considered that the word is not commonly used in Australia in this
manner but that in this instance, it is not used in a derogatory way 
and that the use of the term bangers is one that is used by Gok as part 
of his programs and persona.

'The board considered that the term 'bangers' is not inappropriate and not strong or obscene language in this context.'

The term has since been replaced with 'boobs', a more commonplace Australian term for breasts.
