The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have started legal action against a photographer amid reports that he tried to take a picture of Prince George in a London park, it was revealed today.

A spokesman for the couple said: ‘The Duke and Duchess have taken legal steps to ask that an individual ceases harassing and following both Prince George and his nanny as they go about their ordinary daily lives.

‘An incident last week has prompted their royal highnesses to seek reasonable assurances from the individual about his behaviour.

‘The individual was spotted at a central London park in the vicinity of Prince George, who was removed from the park immediately.

‘There is reason to suspect that the individual may have been placing Prince George under surveillance and monitoring his daily routines for a period of time.

‘The Duke and Duchess understand the particular public role that Prince George will one day inherit, but, while he is young, he must be permitted to lead as ordinary a life as possible.

‘No parent would tolerate the suspicion of someone pursuing and harassing their child and carer whilst their child is playing in a public park or going about their daily activities.’

The statement came in response to newspaper reports that a photographer had apparently tried to take pictures of the prince in Battersea Park.

The London Evening Standard reported that there had also been an episode when a photographer was told to move on by police when he was seen waiting outside Buckingham Palace, where Prince George is sometimes taken to swim in the palace pool.

It is understood that William and Kate want Prince George to have the freedom to experience normal childhood activities, like going to the park and playing with other children, without the threat of harassment or being placed under surveillance.

It is also understood that the individual has already been spoken to by protection officers about his behaviour towards members of the Royal Family on previous occasions over a number of years.

It is not the first time the couple, who are expecting their second child, have had concerns about their privacy.

Earlier this year, a German newspaper published a photograph showing Kate's bottom.

The Duchess is pictured walking with William during their tour of Australia when a gust of wind blows up her dress at the back.

German tabloid Bild caused controversy by running the image, with one commentator describing the move as ‘utterly tasteless’.

And French magazine Closer sparked anger by printing topless images of Kate, 32, while she was sunbathing on a private holiday with William, 31, in September 2012.
