The last letter written by Dambusters hero Guy Gibson on the day before he died has been sold at auction for more than £11,000.

The RAF pilot wrote the note to his secretary Joyce Meade to thank her for helping to type the proofs for his autobiography, and enclosed a gold brooch with the Air Force's wings.

But the very next day, Gibson was killed at the age of 26 when his Mosquito plane crashed during a night-time sortie over Germany.

Unaware of his fate, Ms Meade replied to the letter, thanking him for the 'delightful surprise' and saying she would wear the jewellery with 'great pride'.

Letter: Guy Gibson wrote this note to his secretary the day before he died in September 1944

Gift: The RAF hero also included this gold brooch with the wings which are the symbol of the Air Force

Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his role in leading the 'Dambusters' raids on the Mohne Dam in 1943, one of the best-known operations of the Second World War.

The next year, he asked Ms Meade to type up his memoirs - which he had, poignantly, wanted to call The Boys Die Young.

He wrote his note of thanks on September 18, 1944 - but on September 19, he went missing over Germany, and his body was later found and buried by locals in the Dutch town of Steengbergen.

Gibson's death was not officially announced until nearly four months later.

His last letter was postmarked from 54 Base, RAF, Coningsby, Lincs, and addressed to Ms Meade's home in Balham, south London.

It reads: 'My Dear Miss Meade. I am enclosing a little gift in the form of a gold RAF brooch in deep appreciation of the work you put in on my book.

'It was very nice of you to spare all the time and I'm glad to say the book is now getting passed for censorship.

'When it does get published I shall make another little gift to you so that you can buy something for yourself.

'But in the meantime all the best and thanks very much. Yours sincerely, Guy Gibson.'

Ms Meade kept the letter from Gibson - as well as the reply she sent which he never received - for the rest of her life, before leaving the notes and brooch to a friend when she died in 2000.

The items were sold at auction in Battle, East Sussex this week - and although the estimate was set at £300, they ended up going for a total of £11,200 including auctioneer's fees.

Mark Ellin, of Burtsow and Hewett, said: 'I suppose the gift and letter was a last chivalrous act performed by Guy Gibson. They are very poignant items considering what happened to him the following day.

'Any items connected with Gibson or the Dambusters are extremely rare and are hardly ever seen on the open market. The men were held in such high regard in Britain and abroad.

'We had seven telephone bidders, but they dropped out at £3,000 and it was left to two men in the room.

'The under-bidder told me afterwards that he had to drop out - as how could he explain to his wife that he had spent £11,000 on a letter?'

Gibson made his name in May 1943, when he led 'Operation Chastise' aimed at destroying the Mohne and Eder dams.

The RAF aces used Barnes Wallis' bouncing bomb to cause catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories in Germany's Ruhr Valley.

The next year, during an extended break from flying, Gibson was encouraged to write his memoirs, which were published posthumously in 1946 under the title Enemy Coast Ahead.

Guy Gibson was the perfect choice to lead the 617 Squadron - colloquially dubbed 'the Dambusters' - even though he was just 24 at the time.

He had a flawless record, leadership skills and could fly the new Lancaster.

The success of the Dambusters, which wiped out the Mohne and Eder dams and seriously damaged the German war effort - made Gibson the most highly decorated pilot in the RAF.

The raid became one of the best-known operations of the war thanks to the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd. 

He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

Usually, former commanders moved on to senior office-based roles to see out the rest of the war after a successful raid.

Army leaders and politicians encouraged Gibson to do so, as if he was captured or killed it would have seriously damaged British morale, but he insisted on retaining his place as an active pilot.

He was initially posted at a Lincolnshire bomber base at East Kirkby on a strictly non-operational basis.

However, after persistent pestering from Gibson, the top brass decided to let him lead a bomber squadron into Germany.

On September 19, 1944, Gibson led a huge force into Germany to attack railways and industrial targets at Monchengladbach and Rheydt.

He did not return from the operation in his Mosquito fighter, and mystery and controversy have surrounded his crash ever since.

Gibson orchestrated the attack and ordered the bombers home, but was then never heard from again.

His plane was seen plunging into the ground at Steenbergen in Holland. Part of his remains were later found, and buried where they were discovered.

It was long thought that he had suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but in recent years it has been suggested that Gibson was the victim of friendly fire.

Sir Barnes Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb, said of Gibson: 'For some men of great courage and adventure, inactivity was a slow death. Would a man like Gibson ever have adjusted back to peacetime life?

'One can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through. Facing death had become his drug.

'He had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade. Perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their Bomber Command Valhalla.

'He had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it. But that was the kind of man he was. A man of great courage, inspiration and leadership. A man born for war - but born to fall in war.'
