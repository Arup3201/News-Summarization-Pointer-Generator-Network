Brunei is to become the first East Asian country to adopt Sharia law despite international criticism.

Sharia punishments will include severing of limbs for theft and death by stoning for adulterers andwill be introduced over a period of three years.

The tiny state on the island of Borneo is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and relies on oil and gasexports for its prosperity. 

Strict laws: The move was announced by Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and will come into effect from tomorrow

Almost three-quarters of those who live in Brunei are Malay Muslims but there are also Buddhist andChristian communities.

The move was announced by the 67-year-old sultan.

He said: 'Today I place my faith in and am grateful to Allah the almighty to announce that tomorrow,Thursday, May 1 2014, will see the enforcement of Sharia law phase one, to be followed by the otherphases.' 

From tomorrow people will face conviction by Islamic courts and fines or jail terms for offences like  pregnancy outside marriage, failure to perform Friday prayers and propagating other religions.

A second phase comes into effect 12 months later covering offences for theft and alcohol consumption by Muslims, punishable by whipping and amputations.

The death penalty, including by stoning, will be introduced in the final phase a year later for offences including adultery, sodomy and insulting the Koran or the Prophet Muhammad.

Most of the laws will also apply to non-Muslims.

That raises concern among Western workers in the oil sector and tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese Bruneians and 30,000 mostly Roman Catholic Filipino migrant workers.

About 20 per cent of residents are non-Muslim, including substantial Buddhist and Christiancommunities.

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights denounced the new system for applying the death penalty to a wide range of offences.

Several of the penalties constitute torture under international law, said Emerlynne Gil, SoutheastAsia legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists.

'A lot of these provisions and penalties discriminate against women. Stoning to death normally has ahuge impact on women because more often than not they are found guilty of these crimes.'

This week celebrities, including U.S. television personality Ellen DeGeneres and British actor Stephen Fry, announced will be boycotting the hotel chain owned by the sultan on grounds thatthe new laws criminalised homosexuality.

The Dorchester Collection of hotels is owned by the Sultan of Brunei. 

American shoe designer Brian Atwood and 
fashion designer Peter Som are mobilising the fashion industry to 
boycott The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles which 
are the only U.S. hotels that are part of The Dorchester Collection.

Gay rights organisations in the Asia Pacific have condemned the move to Sharia law.

'It may open the floodgates for further human rights violations against women, children, and other people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,' two such groups wrote in the Malaysian Insider.

'Penalty by death sentence contravenes several international human rights laws.

'Further, death by stoning constitutes torture or other cruel, degrading and inhumane acts of punishment, thus a clear infringement of international humanitarian principles and universal human rights.'

A Christian priest in Brunei said he was concerned by the development, but hoped the new system would be enforced less strictly than set down in the written law.

'They have been giving seminars to different groups to clarify,' said the priest, who declined to beidentified.

Authorities, he said 'seem genuinely concerned' at suggestions that the system would have an all-pervasive enforcement network.

Brunei's top Islamic scholar denied any suggestion the system would lead to extremes, persecution or cruelty.

'It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning', Awang Abdul Aziz was quoted as saying by statemedia after the law was announced.

'There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.'

Brunei officials have said there will be a high burden of proof required to sentence suspects toharsher punishments. They say criminal cases rose by a third between 2000 and 2008.

Arrests for drug abuse surged 50 per cent last year from 2012.

Diplomats say it remains unclear how the new system will work in practice and operate alongside thepolice and courts under the existing British-based legal system.

The religious turn taken by the sultan contrasts with a reputation for decadent excess gained by the royal family.

Pop idol Michael Jackson was paid a reported $17 million to give a concert in Brunei in 1996 tomark the sultan's 50th birthday.

Details of the lavish lifestyle of the sultan's brother, former finance minister Prince Jefri, including owning hundreds of luxury cars and a large yacht - became public during a family legal feud.

Critics say the new penal code will give authorities expanded powers to stifle dissent at a time whenpalace officials are concerned about dwindling energy reserves.

'A common concern among the palace elite is that the gas is going to run out. The population's loyalty has been bought with gas money,' said Maung Zarni, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics who quit the Darussalam Brunei University in 2013 over what he said was a lack of academic freedom.

Responding to a rare outbreak of dissent on social media, the sultan warned in February that anyone criticising the new laws could be punished under their provisions.

Leaders of Malaysia's Islamist PAS party, part of the opposition, say the move has accelerated theirbid to install sharia punishments in Kelantan state, which they control.

In Indonesia, some districts have sharia-inspired by-laws but Aceh is the only province allowed toimplement it as law.

The province has its own sharia police force and courts that enforce strict laws against gambling,promiscuity and alcohol.
