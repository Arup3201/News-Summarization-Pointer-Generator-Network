A pedophile teacher who replaced Bin Laden on the FBIâ€™s most wanted list after spending five years on the run faces decades in prison after pleading guilty to filming children in school bathrooms.

Eric Justin Toth, 31, now faces up to 30 years in jail after years of abuse which was only uncovered after a school camera that had been in his possession was found to have child pornography on it.

A tip off from a tourist eventually lead to his arrest in Nicaragua earlier this year, where he travelled using a fake passport, and was found living under an assumed name with fake credit cards.

Eric Justin Toth, 31, faces up to 30 years behind bars after admitting to hiding a camera the children's toilet at a school where he was a teacher

According to his plea bargain he now faces between 22 and 30 years behind bars. Appearing in court he answered simply 'yes' or 'no' to questions asked of him, except for correcting the age of one of his victims.

His sick behaviour was discovered after a school camera was found to have child pornography on it, but In fact Toth had been taking sinister videos of children for years, across several different states.

Court documents revealed that in 2005 Toth had taken pictures and video of a sleeping camper on a school trip in Wisconsin, and two years later filmed himself abusing a prepubescent boy.

According to court documents Toth also filmed a sleeping camper on a trip in Wisconsin in 2005, and recorded himself abusing a prepubescent boy in 2007

The former school teacher and camp counselor spent five years on the run and replaced Osama Bin Laden on the FBI's most wanted list after his crimes came to light

He also installed hidden cameras in the bathroom of Beauvoir School, Washington, where he worked as a third grade teacher. That camera captured footage of 15 children aged under 10.

'Eric Toth is every parent's worst nightmare: a serial predator who took advantage of his position as a camp counselor and a teacher to sexually exploit children in his care,' U.S. Attorney Ron Machen said in a statement.

After the camera was found to contain child porn, Toth was taken off campus by security, but fled before police could apprehend him.

He then moved across states, living in Texas and Arizona before finally settling in Nicaragua.

At one point his car was found at Minnesota airport containing an apparent suicide note and a flash drive with images of child pornography on it, suggesting he kept up his sick fantasies while on the run.

Toth was placed on to the FBI's Most wanted list following the death of Osama Bin Laden and the eventual publicity lead to a civilian tip-off that he was living abroad.

Toth pleaded guilty to producing child pornography, identity theft and misusing a Social Security number.

His attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.
