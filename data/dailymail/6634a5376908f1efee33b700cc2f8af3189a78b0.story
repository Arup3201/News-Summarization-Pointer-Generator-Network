Manchester United and Arsenal are likely to be the beneficiaries of the footballing meltdown of Jurgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund, with Mats, Hummels, Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan ever more likely to leave at the end of the season after the 2012 Champions League runners-up from slumped to the bottom of the Bundesliga.

Wednesday night’s 1-0 defeat against Augsburg witnessed the extraordinary scenes of goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller climbing the perimeter fence to sympathise with angry fans after the home defeat left them three points from safety. 

Hummels, too, was pictured talking to fans through the metal grille of the fences and apologised to fans.

The bottom of the Bundesliga as it stands

But with Bild Zeitung, Germany’s most powerful newspaper, now asking: ‘Is Klopp still the right man for Borussia Dortmund?’ it seems clear that the next few months will mark the end of the era for the team that so charmed Europe in 2011 and 2012 with its high-energy incisive football.

Klopp himself has to show improvement by the Schalke derby match at the end of the month or face the sack, according to Bild: an extraordinary fate for a man touted as Arsene Wenger’s successor just a few months ago.

Klopp’s team though also looks ready to be broken up as the strongest personalities, who made up its backbone in the run up  to the Champions League final, seem ready to leave.

Reus’ departure in the summer is set and it was significant that the player received the worst possible mark from Bild of 6, indicating ‘awful’ for Wednesday night's display, with the comment that he was more of ‘liability than leader, more of a risk than a creative force’ and that he appeared to be ‘longing for Spain.’

Reus, who sustained an ankle ligament injury on the eve of the World Cup finals last year, has his heart set on a move to Barcelona, but their transfer ban means that he will no longer be able to move there in the summer. Real Madrid are likely to step into the breach as the club most likely to sign him.

Bayern Munich have been the traditional destination of Dortmund players, Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski having taken that route in the past two seasons, but relations between the club are now so bad after Bayern's chief executive Karl Heinz Rummenigge publicly revealed that Reus has a £20million buy-out clause, that a deal there would be impossible.

Manchester City and Manchester United’s only chance will be if Real decide not to pursue him. Arsenal and Chelsea would also bid – but Arsenal’s surplus of midfielders means they may not be willing to pay the kind of wages he will be offered elsewhere.

Hummels of course has been Louis van Gaal’s No 1 choice of defender ever since he took the United job last summer and though the club was unable to buy him from Dortmund last summer, the fall-out from this calamitous season and Hummels’ own comments that he would consider his future at the end of the season mean that he is likely to end up at Old Trafford – though Dortmund will demand £30million.

Hummels is high up on Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal's transfer wish-list  

Gundogan is a player who was highly-rated and desired across Europe two seasons ago – but who has since spent the best part of last season out with a back injury, which meant he missed out on last year’s World Cup triumph.

Arsenal had him high up their list of targets prior to that injury and will sign a defensive midfielder in his role over the summer. The German, whose contract runs until 2016, has a buy-out clause of £16m. Arsenal are likely to look at other options first but if he can demonstrate some of the old form, he could yet end up at The Emirates.

For now though all three star players and Klopp have a relegation battle with which they need to contend. Prior to the five-week winter break, almost all pundits were convinced that, bad though things were, there was no chance of Dortmund being relegated. After two games back, no goals and no wins, that certainty no longer holds.

Bild ripped into Dortmund following their latest loss and suggested that Klopp has until the Revierderby with Schalke on February 28 to show there is 'light at the end of the relegation tunnel' otherwise his job is under threat.

They add that the greatest example of how standards have fallen this season is star man Marco Reus, who 'displays a body language more like Bambi than Rambo.' They say his heart is already set on a Dortmund exit, most likely to Spain.

Bild add that Ciro Immobile was a bad buy and doesn't fit into Klopp's system at all.

Ruhr Nachrichten are scathing in their ratings, with Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin Grosskreutz, Reus and Immobile receiving a score of 5. In the German ratings system, 1 is regarded as 'excellent' and 6 as 'awful'.

New signing Kevin Kampfl and defender Sokratis both receive 4.5, while the highest marks of 3.5 are given to Roman Weidenfeller, Never Subotic and Nuri Sahin.
