Online donors have contributed over $21,000 to the medical expenses of a Phoenix boy savagely mauled this summer in a park by a pit bull, whose life was controversially saved by a tens of thousands petition signatures and a judge's ruling.

Kevin Vicente, 4, will never fully recover from the attack on February 20, but his mother has thanked the generosity and support they have received through internet donations in just 10 days since the fund open, with one anonymous donor giving $13,000.

'I wish that it had happened to me instead of him, but there's nothing I can do,' mom Flora Vicente told AZ Central.

'Then he sees me and says, ''Don't cry mommy, I love you''. But then five minutes goes by and the same thing happens again.'

Mrs Vicente, whose family is in Guatemala, had to quit her job to care for her little boy.  

Savagely mauled: Kevin Vicente, whose face was virtually ripped off in a dog attack in February, has received over $21,000 in online donations in just 10 days

Scarred for life: Kevin Vicente suffered a broken eye socket and jaw in the February mauling, and has months, if not years, 
of reconstructive surgery ahead of him

Spared: Mickey the pit bull who attacked four-year-old Kevin Vicente February 20 in Phoenix won a reprieve from a judge, who ruled that the dog will be neutered and defanged instead of being euthanized

Support: Kevin's mother, Flora Vicente (right), said she was disturbed by the support people gave the dog that attacked her son

Adding to her pain is the fact the animal responsible for her son's mauling - a pit bull cross named Mickey - arguably received more support than her child, whose face was virtually ripped off by the dog.

'It disturbed me at first that they placed more value on an animal than on a child, and that they made me feel very bad,' she said.

'For me he is worth gold.'

In March, an Arizona judge spared Mickey's life, chosing to have him neutered, defanged and microshipped, rather than euthanized.

'There would be absolutely no possibility of the animal ever doing this to someone again,' Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffin ruled, adding that the dog must remain in a facility for the rest of his life and cannot be adopted.

Kevin  was left with a broken eye socket and jaw after the attack, and has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him.

The question of whether the pit bull should live or die attracted a team of top death penalty lawyers, with candlelight vigils riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media, who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. 

Kevin was playing in a yard where his sitter had taken him, when he walked within the 18-foot radius of the dog's chain next door. 

Public outcry: The Change.org petition to save Mickey recieved 65,000 signatures

Gifts: Kevin has been receiving cards and presents from kind strangers 

Getting better: Now 10 months after the mauling, Kevin is better but still has a long way to go

Donations: A fundraising effort for Kevin exceeded its goal of $20,000 in just over 10 days, and there is still a month remaining when donors can contribute to the site

Witnesses testified that little Kevin grabbed Mickey's bone and dropped it when the dog growled. 

When the toddler made no attempt to flee, the pit bull went on the attack, MyFox Phoenix reported. 

Guadalupe Villa, whose boyfriend's mother was looking after Kevin the day of the attack, filed the vicious-dog court petition that started the case, saying Mickey has a history of acting without provocation and killed one of her dogs.

Animal advocates struck back, saying both the dog and boy are victims and Kevin's baby sitter was negligent in letting him play near the animal 'unsupervised.'

They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up. 

Life sentence: The white-and-brown pit bull will live out his days in an animal shelter without the possibility of ever being put up for adoption

Judge Griffin said several people shared some responsibility for the attack. 

The judge pointed out that there was a 'Beware of Dog' sign on the property's fence but the gate was left open and children were allowed to play near the dog.

'This whole case has been very, very distressing to me,' Griffin said, adding that Kevin will pay the price for the rest of his life.

A half dozen animal rights advocates attended the hearing in T-shirts that bore a paw mark and a slogan, 'Save Mickey.'

One of them, Veronica Lee, said the hearing showed that the baby sitter wasn't watching closely and that Mickey was kept chained.

'We were not here to put a dog above Kevin,' Lee said. 'We were just here to make sure justice was served.'

Nightmare scenario: The dog grabbed Kevin's face and would not let go, causing severe injuries

Luis Acosta, who said he's not related to anyone involved in the case, disagreed with the judge's decision.

'Who is going to see to it five years from now that this dog still hasn't been adopted out?' Acosta said.

Those hoping to rescue Mickey took their cause to Facebook, where a 'Save Mickey' page garnered more than 65,000 likes.

On the Facebook page, the pit bull's supporters clarified Tuesday evening that Mickey's fangs will not be pulled out, but rather ground down.

The dog's supporters recently used social media to organize a candlelight vigil and even a YouTube video plea.

Animal rights activists also took their cause to Change.org, creating a petition to save Mickey from being euthanized that has drawn nearly 65,000 signatures - 10,000 shy of the threshold for the petition to be taken under consideration by the White House.

Mickey has been living in a cage at the Maricopa County Animal Control and Care Center.
