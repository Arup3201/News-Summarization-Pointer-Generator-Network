As wholesome childhood rituals go, it is up there with writing a letter to Santa and leaving a lost tooth under a pillow for the fairy to find.

But one traditional Easter egg hunt in Seattle at the weekend turned nasty.

Police officers had to intervene when a fight broke out between two mothers during the childrens' rush to retrieve as many chocolate treats as possible.

The Easter egg hunt at Woodland Park 
Zoo on Sunday afternoon turned sour after 'one woman reportedly pushed a
child aside as her own child was scrambling toward some brightly 
colored eggs', a statement on the Seattle Police Department blotter 
said.

Officers say the two women had to be separated three or four times, according to aÂ CBS Seattle report.

Only one mother was still there when police arrived. She said she did not wish to pursue charges against her attacker.

Her decision left officers without 'any info that could crack the case', police said.
