An Austrian artist has figured out how be in three places at the same time with the help of two robots.

Alex Kiessling is today creating a work of art simultaneously in Vienna, London and Berlin in what he described as a world first.

33 year-old Kiessling is using an infra-red sensor to trace the movements of his pen and send the signal via satellite to the industrial robots on Trafalgar Square and Breitscheidplatz.

Viennese artist Alex Kiessling is painting a 'Long Distance Art' picture in Vienna, Austria today

The artist, who said he has a life-long fascination with robots, is using two ABB IRB 4600 industrial machines, each 2.8 metres high and weighing in at 435 kilograms.

The robots will be controlled via satellite to produce the Berlin and London artworks.

Kiessling said it took more than six months to perfect the technique and the software used.

The cross-border project is called ‘Long
 Distance’ and claims to bring together art and technology in a way that
 has never been done before.

Kiessling said that as he learned to work with the robots, he increasingly questioned the concepts of original and copy.

‘What are the machines doing, actually?’ he asked during a news conference.

‘It appeared to me in working with the machines that it was less about a kind of copy and more like a clone.’

The artist is drawing a ‘hybrid head’ - one full face with two half heads on either side.

The heads will be joined together and exhibited as a panel painting in Vienna and London.
