John Guidetti has seemingly distanced himself from a longer stay at Celtic by telling Dutch media he wants to return to Feyenoord 'perhaps as soon as possible'.

The Swede scored 20 goals when on loan in Rotterdam in the 2011-12 season and remains hugely popular with Feyenoord fans.

Guidetti, who made the comment in an interview with RTV Rijnmond, will become a free agent at the end of the season when his loan at Parkhead from Manchester City expires.

The 22-year-old striker placed talks about a permanent deal in Glasgow on hold in January as he endured a long scoreless run. Guidetti has since scored twice in his last four appearances - raising his tally to 13 overall - but it remains to be seen whether Celtic will put forward a lucrative contract offer to try to persuade him to stay. French giants Marseille and Southampton have also been linked with interest in the striker.

Meanwhile, Ronny Deila claims he wants Craig Gordon to stay with Celtic for the remainder of his career.

The Parkhead boss has already spoken with chief executive Peter Lawwell about the possibility of a new contract for the keeper, who signed a two-year deal when he joined the club last summer.

Gordon's excellent performances since then have been key to Celtic's progress under Deila and brought the 32-year-old firmly back into contention to be Scotland's No1.

According to reports in England, they have also attracted the attention of Chelsea, who have apparently included his name on a list of candidates to be back-up to Thibaut Courtois next season.

Deila, though, is keen for the former £9million man to remain in his squad for as long as possible.

'He's a great goalkeeper and a man we want to keep at the club,' insisted the Norwegian. 'We will do everything to keep him here. I understand why other clubs are looking at him because he's had a fantastic season. Myself and Peter have already talked about this. It's also about what Craig wants and hopefully he wants to stay here and be with Celtic.'

Gordon's acquisition on a free transfer was one of the best bargains of recent time in Scottish football.

Asked what value he would now place on the ex-Hearts and Sunderland man, Deila replied: 'I can't sell him. I don't want to. I want him here for the rest of his career.'

On the prospect of Gordon signing up for life on the Chelsea bench after coming through two years of injury anguish and rekindling his career at Celtic, Deila said: 'It would be a shame but I don't think he wants to do that – he wants to play football until the end of his career.

'It's a rumour and we will see what's in it. There will be clubs interested if he wants to go, but we want to keep him.

'He's performed great and without him we wouldn't have gone through the group stage (in the Europa League).'

Gordon will again form Celtic's last line of defence as they seek to open up a nine-point Premiership lead with victory over St Johnstone on Wednesday night. Emilio Izaguirre and Kris Commons are, however, sidelined with knocks.
