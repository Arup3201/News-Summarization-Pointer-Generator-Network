Completely Bare, the waxing and laser hair removal salon founded by former Real Housewives of New York cast member Cindy Barshop more than 16 years ago, has rebranded and is under new management after it was revealed that the 50-year-old is busy focusing on other projects.

The New York-based salon, which Ms Barshop opened in 1998, announced the re-vamp on December 5, unveiling its new name - Spruce & Bond - as well as a new website and logo.

Justin Joffe, CEO of the newly re-launched chain, told MailOnline that while Cindy is no longer a part of the day-to-day management team, she will still take an active interest in the running of the salons.

'Cindy was the visionary for our brand and created the foundation that we are leveraging to scale nationally,’ he said. 

'As our company re-launches as Spruce & Bond, a new management team has taken over day to day operations as Cindy is exploring other ventures, but she is very excited about the re-launch and for Spruce & Bond's future.'

The salon, which previously offered a wide variety of beauty treatments from 'vajazzling' to 'vattoos' (temporary tattoos in the bikini area), is now offering a streamlined selection of services and will focus only on waxing, laser hair removal and brow treatments.

Spruce & Bond's new management team has also simplified its pricing; a signature bikini wax will cost $75, laser removal is $1500 and a brow shaping session is $50, compared with the $225 a 'Foxy Bikini' (in which real fox fur was applied to the bikini area) previously cost.

The company, which currently has three locations in Manhattan and one in Westchester, will also open six new outposts in the next 18 months.

Ms Barshop, 50, joined the Real Housewives of New York's cast in 2011, but remained on the Bravo series for just one season.

The mother of twin girls Jesse and Zoe, now four, replaced Bethenny Frankel on the show, but was let go along with Jill Zarin, Alex McCord and Kelly Bensimon following season four.

She told E! News that filming the reality series was 'a lot of work', adding: 'I didn't realize how difficult it was going to be. It's like being on Survivor!'

She later said that she appeared on the show to promote Completely Bare.

'I went on the show for business reasons. I realized reality TV would give me more national exposure than the beauty-focused TV I had been doing,' she told Go Girl Finance in 2012.

'When I started in business, you had to be in magazines, then you had to go on all the talk shows. Now it’s reality TV.'
