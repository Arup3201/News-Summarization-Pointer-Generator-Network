A 100,000-signature petition demanding that Welsh cancer sufferers get the same access to treatment as English patients was handed over by campaigners yesterday.

They called on the Welsh government – which is run by Labour – to create a special fund to pay for advanced but expensive new drugs.

Cancer victims in Wales have been forced to use their own savings or move to England to get cutting-edge medication recommended by their doctors.

If they do try to get the treatment in their own country, they must make bureaucratic ‘individual patient funding requests’ – which are frequently rejected.

By contrast, English sufferers have access to 71 types of pioneering cancer treatment for free on the NHS. 

They are available through the £200million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund, which was set up in 2010.

The petition of 98,230 names was handed to Conservative members of the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff yesterday. 

It was started by Julie McGowan after her friend Ann Wilkinson, a 76-year-old bowel cancer sufferer from Monmouthshire, was initially denied funding for the life-extending drug Avastin.

Mrs McGowan said: ‘We are all part of the National Health Service and I believe Welsh patients should have the same access to these drugs.’

Professor John Wagstaff, from the South West Wales Cancer Institute in Swansea, said the lack of a Cancer Drugs Fund in Wales was a ‘serious issue’. 

He added that his own success rate for getting drugs approved through the independent request scheme was just 15 per cent.

In 2011 the Rarer Cancers Foundation estimated that setting up a Cancer Drugs Fund for Wales would cost around £3.3million a year, depending on which treatments it included.

The charity’s chief executive Andrew Wilson described the inequality in access to treatment as ‘devastating’ for patients. 

Stephen Crabb, the Tory Welsh Secretary, added: ‘Welsh Labour’s continued refusal to adopt the scheme is pure politicking. The Labour Government in Cardiff need to start putting the needs of Welsh people above desire to save face on their own poor policy choices.’

But a spokesman for the Welsh government said: ‘We are proud in Wales that patients have access to proven and cost-effective treatments for all conditions, not just cancer.

‘We will not be replacing our system with a cancer drugs fund – the chair of the Cancer Drugs Fund in England has admitted it provides funding for drugs which have “no impact on survival” and “uncertainty” about whether quality of life is improved or not.

‘Research published in the British Journal of Cancer earlier this year concluded that Wales had a faster uptake of medicines most recently launched and subsequently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence than England.

‘We spend more per head on cancer care than in England and we do not agree with spending millions of pounds on non-approved medicines.’
