Future opponents of Manchester United might want to make sure they remember their shinpads – after Louis van Gaal's players were given a Thai boxing demonstration at Old Trafford.

Under the watchful gaze of martial arts expert Master Sken, players including Michael Carrick, Ashley Young and Adnan Januzaj were given a run through in the ancient method of Muay Thai. 

But fans need not worry about even more injuries at the Theatre of Dreams - because the session was put on with the full blessing of Van Gaal.

The hands-on Dutch manager, who signs off all player appearances, gave the the outing the green light after being assured by the club's media team that it would not involve any risk of injury.

A United source told Sportsmail: 'The guys from the media team had the idea. They are always trying to find engaging content for our audiences around the world and this was for the Manchester United App.

'The players seemed to enjoy it and were laughing and joking about it. It was pretty light – and more of a demonstration really - I'm not sure the manager would appreciate any more injuries.'

On his Facebook page, Master Sken, based in nearby Stockport, wrote about a dream coming true.

'Since I was a child I love Muay Thai and all sport,' he explained. 'Football in particular. I am always a very long loyal fan of Manchester United Football Club and used to live very close to United football Stadium. I have just been asked to teach all the players.'

The session took place 24 hours after Van Gaal's men lost 1-0 at home to Southampton.

The insider added: 'It might have been a good way to clear their heads.'

United launched the app last February and it is available in 17 countries including Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Malawi.
