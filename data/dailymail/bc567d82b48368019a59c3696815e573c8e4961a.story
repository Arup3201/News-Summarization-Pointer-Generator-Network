Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub?

Manchester City will block any attempt by Yaya Toure to force a transfer following bizarre claims that the new Premier League champions failed to celebrate his 31st birthday properly.

Toure’s agent Dimitry Seluk has warned that the £200,000-a-week Ivory Coast star could quit City this summer, accusing the club of treating him like ‘a nobody’ at a party attended by owner Sheik Mansour and other dignitaries in Abu Dhabi last Tuesday.

It emerged on Tuesday that Toure was, in fact, presented with two birthday cakes, on the flight to Abu Dhabi and at the team hotel, and a message on the club’s official Facebook page wishing him a happy birthday received 250,000 ‘likes’ — the most of any post ever on the website.

This was not enough for Seluk, however, who drew comparisons with Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala buying Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos a £800,000 Bugatti car for his 38th birthday in 2011.

He claimed that Toure is so unhappy over the snub that he may be tempted by a return to Barcelona, who sold him to City for £24million four years ago. ‘There is a big possibility that Yaya will leave this summer,’ he said. ‘He is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don’t care about him. It was proof.

‘In a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good wishes. But when you have a big party to celebrate the title and no one comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want?

‘He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti.

‘The club’s owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the Premier League but when they and the players were all together, none of them shook his hand on his birthday. It shows they don’t care about him. This isn’t about a new contract — it’s about human relationships and City have shown they don’t respect him.

‘If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool. But at City Yaya is no hero. He’s nobody. That’s how the club make him feel.

‘He’s very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will if things carry on like this. If you ask 100 per cent or 50-50, better 50-50 than 100. This is not about money. In fact, he would take less to return to Barcelona. All the staff at Barcelona, and players, liked him. He felt like Barcelona was his home.’

Happy birthday to you! City posted this on their Twitter on May 13

Size matters! Part of Dimitry Seluk's unhapiness is apparently down to the 1000kg cake enjoyed by City's owners

Toure has been a key figure in helping City win the Premier League and Capital One Cup this season, scoring 24 goals in 49 appearances from midfield.

But the controversy comes a year after he threatened to leave because there were not enough shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop or posters of him around the Etihad Stadium. On that occasion, City placated him with a new four-year contract until 2017 and increased his salary to £10m a year, but there are unlikely to be any concessions this time.

Although there is a desire within the club to remain on amicable terms with one of their biggest stars, sources insist Toure will not be sold and there will be no more re-negotiations for a player who has three years left on his contract.

One insider dismissed the latest claims yesterday, insisting that Toure is ‘loved at every level of the club’. City gave the player considerable backing when he was the victim of racist abuse during a Champions League tie away to CSKA Moscow in October.

The player later tweeted to tell his followers not to believe anything that did not come from him personally, but then made a bizarre U-turn.

Toure wrote: ‘Thanks for all the birthday messages today. Card from City just arrived... Must have got lost in the post. Haha.’

He then tweeted: ‘Jokes aside. Please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously’ before posting: ‘Everything dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after world cup to explain.’

Please: @BeardedGenius struck up a tongue-in-cheek appeal for clubs to show Yaya Toure some love
