These neon waves may look supernatural, but they are created by one of nature’s smallest creatures.

Millions of plankton glowed like fireflies to light up a Welsh beach, enabling a photographer to capture this eerie spectacle.

Scientists believe the phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction.

Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism.

It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton.

The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light.

Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction.

Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways.

Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat.

Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators.

Millipedes also glow to put predators off from eating them.

Kris Williams caught the ghostly scene at Penmon on Anglesey's east coast where he watched the tiny organisms riding waves and being washed up on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the water.

Williams, of Beaumaris, said the effect, called bioluminescence or cold light, looked like lightning in the water.

‘It’s always at twilight, which is around 11pm at this time of year.

‘It's more abundant in summer - I guess the warmer waters trigger it off and it's always been an electric blue - though of varying shades and intensity.’

The photographer said he had seen the glowing plankton around six times in the last 12 to 18 months at Penmon.

‘You tend to see it at high tide and you need a bit of movement to stir up the plankton,’ he said.

‘Some displays are stronger than others but it's incredible to watch. Some friends of mine came down to swim in it last weekend - to get themselves lit up in the water - it was great fun.’

Williams
 said that sometimes the effect only affects a small area of water, 
while other times it stretches all along the coast.

‘When
 the waves break it almost looks like a lightning storm in the wave. 
When you walk on the pebbles at the water's edge, the pebbles light up.

‘You could put your hand in the water and watch it light up, then see the glowing particles slipping through your fingers.’

Dr Andy Davies, a marine biologist at 
Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, explained: ‘The light is 
created by small organisms called plankton, which are producing this 
light through a complex chemical reaction.

‘This whole process is known as bioluminescence. Many organisms use very similar methods to produce light, including fish, jellyfish, squid and even fireflies.

‘It's an example of how organisms have evolved complex responses to external stimulus.

Dr
 Davies said he had seen bioluminescence only twice in five years, but 
said that late spring and early summer are the best times to see the 
phenomenon.

Bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals, especially in the open sea and in insects.

‘Most
 marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the 
wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater,’ he said.

‘However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.

‘Sometimes
 thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of 
bioluminescent bacteria in the Milky seas effect to watch.’

Lightning bolt moment: Williams said the effect (pictured) called bioluminescence or cold light, looked like lightning in the water. He added that the phenomenon is seen at twilight at this time of year and is more abundant in the summer - perhaps because the water is slightly warmer
