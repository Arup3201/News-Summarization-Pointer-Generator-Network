A 4,400-year-old love story has been uncovered in the ancient Egyptian burial ground of Saqqara.

Archaeologists excavating a tomb of a couple and their children have revealed a relief painting depicting a love scene.

The tomb belonged to a singer working for the Pharaoh, named Kahai, and his priestess wife Meretites.

The scene shows the husband and wife gazing lovingly into each other's eyes, with the priestess Meretites placing her hand over her husband's right shoulder

The colour painting, dating back to the time when the great pyramids were being built in Egypt, is extremely rare.

The scene shows the husband and wife gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes, with Meretites placing her hand over her husband's right shoulder.

Only a handful images showing an affectionate embrace survive from the Old Kingdom (2649 B.C. to 2150 B.C.).

In the scene, Kahai is wearing a leopard’s skin and is is holding a staff and scepter, which served as symbols of authority.

Saqqara is an ancient burial ground in Egypt located near the entrance of the Nile Delta.

Most of Saqqara was buried in sand until the mid-19th century, when Auguste Mariette uncovered the Serapeum.

Since then, it has been a gradual process of rediscovery.

Old Kingdom pharaohs were buried within Saqqara’s 11 major pyramids, while their subjects were buried in the hundreds of smaller tombs.  The name Saqqara is most likely derived from Sokar, the Memphite god of the dead.

Meretites is wearing a long, tight dress with shoulder straps that appear to leave a breast exposed.

The tomb was first discovered in 1966 and published in a book in 1971, but the discovery was mainly recorded in black-and-white.

At the time of the discovery, mummified remains were also found, but it is not certain if they belonged to the family members.

The image has now been unveiled in all its incredible colours by Macquarie University's Australian Center for Egyptology.

Miral Lashien, a researcher at Macquarie University told LiveScience that the tomb of Kahai is an example of the importance of women.

The frequency of their representations in the artwork in the tomband the equal size to their husbands or brothers suggest equal status.

This kind of embrace was not limited to romantic love.

Another image showing a similar pose was found from Pyramid Age Egypt depicting two men who were likely twin brothers, said Ms Lashien.
