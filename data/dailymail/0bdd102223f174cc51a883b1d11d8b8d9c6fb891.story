It may have become renowned for vajazzles and fake tan, but Essex has just achieved a new status that certainly won't leave other regions 'well jel'.

Wheatley Road in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex has been named the slowest street in the country for broadband, tied with Erw 
Fawr in in Conwy, Wales, with average download speeds of just 0.60Mbps. 

This is 96 times slower than the fastest speeds in Loundes Road, Derbyshire and 30 times slower than the national average speed of  17.8Mbps.

This is 96 times slower than the fastest speeds in Derbyshire and 30 times slower than the national average of 17.8Mbps

To put these speeds into perspective, it would take residents in these two streets an average 15.2 hours to download an 
HD-quality film.

And roads in Essex feature six times in the list of the UK’s 50 slowest streets - more than any other county - according to the latest consumer speed test data collected by comparison site uSwitch.com.

Princes Avenue in Maylandsea, Chelmsford, for example, is the slowest Essex street after Wheatley Road.

With an average speed of 1.15Mbps, it would take 23 minutes to download an album.

The research is based on almost two million speed tests run by broadband users over a six-month period.

It also found only 15 per cent of Brits are receiving broadband of 30Mbps or higher - the speed classified by the EU as being 'superfast’.

Figures from Ofcom confirm that superfast broadband is now available to almost three quarters (73 per cent) of the UK, yet only 9 per cent of the population is using it.

Residents
 of Loundes Road in Unstone, Dronfield, Derbyshire are enjoying the 
fastest download speeds in the country, of 57.58Mbps.

By comparison to the slowest streets, residents of Loundes Road could download a HD movie in just nine minutes.

Four in 10 Brits are experiencing speeds of under 5Mbps. At 5Mbps, it takes 13 minutes to download an episode of a TV show

The fastest broadband measured in London was found in Camel Road in E16, at 34.62Mbps, while the slowest street is Grange Gardens in Hampstead - where the average download speed is just 1.19Mbps.

But the scourge of sluggish speeds isn’t limited to just 50 streets.

Four in 10 (40 per cent) Britons are experiencing speeds of under 5Mbps.

At 5Mbps, it takes 13 minutes to download just one episode of a TV show.  

Marie-Louise
 Abretti, broadband expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'There are still areas 
in the UK which experience broadband speeds so slow the service is 
negligible.

'Broadband
 is now widely considered the fourth utility, but our speed test data 
shows that not everyone is getting a decent service.

'Poor
 connectivity can severely affect local businesses, impact house prices 
and children’s education, which is why it’s crucial the government keeps
 its eye on the ball when it comes to improving UK broadband 
infrastructure, particularly in remote rural areas.'

*The national average is 17.8Mbps
