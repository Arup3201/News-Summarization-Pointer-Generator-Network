The BBC has already spent £6.5million on relocation deals for just 549 staff moving to its new headquarters in Salford.

Dozens of workers have been given tens of thousands of pounds each to fund their move.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information act show that already three members of staff have received in excess of £80,000 to pay for their moves, with two getting about £85,000.

The BBC's new Salford base has been operational since May 2011, and began broadcasting from the site in September

Another has received £70,000, with two others getting £67,000 and another £64,000 as the true individual cost of the move is laid bare.

The BBC’s offer to workers moving to Salford includes payments for stamp duty, estate agents fees, not to mention up to £3,000 a head to buy carpets and curtains.

Others have received up to £1,900 a month, before tax, to rent a home in the North West, in a deal which lasts for up to two years, allowing them to temporarily maintain current homes.

The corporation has even provided a house-buying scheme which sees it, through an external company, buying staff’s properties for 85 per cent of their market value.

The new figures, which cover the period up to mid-November, also show more than a dozen people have been given between £40,000 and £50,000 with almost 30 receiving between £30,000 and £40,000 and about 35 individuals in the £20,000 to £30,000 band.

The figures are set to rise further as they do not even cover the remaining 250 individuals in the first phase of the move.

BBC Presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new MediaCityUK complex in Salford.

A further thousand roles are being relocated to Salford in a second phase, although it is currently unclear how many people will decide to move with their jobs.

The BBC has already moved its children’s department, sport, Radio 5 Live as well as part of its new media division to Salford and hopes to move BBC Breakfast there next month.

Presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new MediaCityUK complex in Salford.

Broadcasting bosses had originally earmarked £30million for relocation deals and believe that they will fall well within budget for this.

Nevertheless some of the large individual payments will raise questions about the controversial move and whether the attempts to make the BBC less London-centric’ are too costly.

There is also a provision for temporary accommodation costs to be paid for up to six months and duplicate costs for gas, water and electricity and council tax can also covered for those caught in a housing chain.

The BBC’s scheme will pay for estate agent fees of up to 1.5 per cent of the sale price, and the £3,000 towards ‘household goods’ like carpets and curtains for those moving house.

The so-called Remote Location Allowance, allows people to receive up to £1,900 a month for two years, if they are not in a position to fully move from their London home, such as in cases where children are taking exams.

Figures provided under the Freedom of Information request, cover up to mid-November, and account for almost 550 out of about 800 people that opted to make the move as part of the first phase.

About 1,500 roles have moved from London in the initial ‘migration’,

Other costs incurred by the BBC include interest payments on bank loans for the house-buying scheme and paying tax liabilities on relocation payments.

Most up to date figures show 160 people are on remote location deals and only 30 people have taken part in the BBC’s house-buying scheme, with vast majority buying houses in the traditional way.

The Salford base has been operational since May 2011 and began broadcasting from the site in September.

The BBC says that by next month the first phase of the move will be complete.

BBC North human resources director Ken Lee said the new figures represent a ‘snapshot’ at a point in time and said the corporation’s packages had been benchmarked against other organisations.

He said the deals were not about ‘enrichment’ but making sure people did not lose any money as a result of relocating their jobs.
