David Axelrod has said goodbye to his mustache - his faithful companion for the last 40 years.

The idea to part with the facial hair first came during the 2012 presidential race when Axelrod, President Obama's senior campaign adviser, announced he was so confident that the Democratic incumbent would win the key battleground states of Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania that Axelrod would shave his mustache if Obama failed to claim victory.

When Obama was declared the winner, Axelrod's stache was safe...but he turned the idea into gold for a good cause. After raising $1 million for epilepsy research, Axelrod appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe in New York on Friday and freed his upper lip of the hair that had nested there for 40 years.

Scroll down for video.

This is a mustache: In October, David Axelrod told the Morning Joe hosts he would shave his mustache if Obama lost the key battleground states of Minnesota, Michigan or Pennsylvania in the election

Now you see it, now you don't: Axelrod held on to the facial hair since Obama was successful in the election but he ultimately ditched the stache for charity

When Axelrod put his mustache on the line in an October interview on Morning Joe, in the lead up to November 6, the race to the White House really began to heat up - with many in the media joking the New York native might have to part with his long term accessory.

Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough in turn had said he would grow a mustache if Romney lost Florida or North Carolina.

After Obama's re-election, and his victory in Florida, Axelrod didn't need to pay up but Scarborough, apparently uncertain of how the new look would suit him, decided to use the publicity to help a good cause.

Axelrod has a daughter, 31-year-old Lauren, who suffers from epilepsy and he decided to launch a fundraising effort in early November to benefit CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), a non-profit that Axelrod's wife, Susan, started in 1998.

In return, Scarborough kicked off the effort with a $10,000 donation as part of the  'Slash the Stache' campaign.

The moment of truth: Axelrod was surrounded by his wife Susan (left), MSNBC host Joe Scarborough (second from left), Steve from eShave and host Mika Brzezinski (right) for the momentous shave

Faithful friend: Axelrod, 57, has had the stache for 40 years and said he was up all night preparing to say goodbye to the facial hair

Axelrod said if he could raise $1 million in one month, he would come on Morning Joe and shave the mustache.

In the course of the month, over 2,608 donors pledged $1,051,679.

High profile donors included real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who donated $100,000, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who gave $200,000. Other donors included President Obama, George Clooney and Tom Hanks.

'It took David's mustache to bring Donald Trump and President Obama together,' the hosts joked on Friday about the bi-partisan participation.

With the fundraising mark met - Axelrod said he would make good on his promise.

'I will keep my part of the bargain and surrender the stache at 7:15 on @ Morning_Joe!' he tweeted late Thursday in anticipation of his transformation on Friday.

Do not try this at home: Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski stepped in with an electric razor but Axelrod didn't look too sure about her participation

Saying goodbye: The professionals stepped in, with Steve from eShave leading the effort

Cleaning up: The barber also used a straight razor to shave away the hair that has rested on Axelrod's upper lip for 40 years

Axelrod was joined by his wife Susan and Morning Joe hosts Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for the day of reckoning.

In the lead up to the shave, Axelrod admitted, 'I'm very attached to it.'

'Does your mustache have any last requests?' Scarborough joked.

'I was up all night, to be 
honest with you. Itâ€™s a little unsettling. I was up last night talking to it...it keeps saying 'Why, why, why, do we have to do this?' he added, though he conceded that the end did justify the means.

Gone but not forgotten: Axelrod prepares to see himself without a mustache for the first time in 40 years

Did I really just do that? At first, Axelrod seemed uncertain about his choice

Satisfied customer: After a few moments getting used to the idea, and with a little encouragement from his wife, Axelrod couldn't help but smile

Axelrod's wife was on hand for the ordeal. The couple married in 1979, when he was already sporting a mustache, and she has never known him without the facial hair.

'It was very dark then,' she said about the state of the stache in his youth, 'It has lightened,' she added euphemistically about it aging gracefully.

Throughout the chit-chat, Axelrod closed his eyes and braced himself for the inevitable moment, saying he bet his friends at the White House were watching...'and laughing.'

A new man: David Axelrod shaved his mustache on Friday as part of his campaign to raise $1 million for epilepsy research

Scarborough offered to help out but Axelrod said he 'was not going to let Joe Scarborough near my neck with a straight razor.'

A professorial from eShave, Steve, was on set to do the actual deed.

The 57-year-old looked pain as the razor came down and the hair began to fall.

After the shave, his wife complimented him on his new look and even Donald Trump called the show to congratulate Axelrod for his commitment to charity and willingness to go under the razor for a good cause.

But the suspense continued even after the mustache was gone.

'Slashthestachers, stay tuned. At 4:30 p.m. on CNN, one of DC's remaining mustachioed personalities is going 2 put his whiskers on the line,' Axelrod tweeted after this appearance on Morning Joe about his next media spot.
