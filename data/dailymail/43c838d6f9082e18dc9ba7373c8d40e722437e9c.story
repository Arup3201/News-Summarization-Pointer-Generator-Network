George Osborne today said he was ‘proud’ that the UK government is spending more on foreign aid.

The Chancellor risked the wrath of Tory backbenchers who have called for cuts to international development by announcing an extra £800million for 2015-16.

But to meet the coalition’s pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid, money from the Home Office and Business will count towards the target.

Aid: The coalition has committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid, while cutting elsewhere

Proud: George Osborne defended the decision to increase foreign aid spending while cutting other Whitehall departments y up to 10 per cent

Right wingers on the Tory backbenchers have repeatedly called for an end to the protection given to overseas aid.

Along with health and schools, it was one of the only areas of spending ring fenced by Mr Osborne in his search for an extra £11.5billion of cuts in 2015-16.

In total the UK will spend £12.22billion in its Official Development Assistance commitment.

It means it will spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015 on helping the poor overseas. It includes an extra £809million in the DFID budget.

Around £100million in science research for helping poor countries from the Department for Business will also count towards the ODA target, along with £100million of Home Office funding for asylum cases.

Spending: Only foreign aid, NHS and the spy agencies have seen increases in the departmental programme and administration budgets, with most departments suffering cuts of up to 10 per cent

Infrastructure: Billions of pounds in extra building projects have been directed towards transport, justice and business in an attempt to kickstart growth

Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘Fairness also means refusing to balance the budget on the backs of the world’s poorest.

‘I know not everyone believes we should fulfil our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on development.

‘But I do – and I’m proud to support a Government that is the first in our history to meet our pledge and meet it not only this year, but next year and the year after.

‘Of course, overseas development is about more than just the DFID budget, and we comply with internationally policed rules.

‘But the DFID budget is the lion’s share, and it will be set at £11.1 billion in 2015-16.

‘Even in tough times, the decisions we make mean we keep to our commitments.’
