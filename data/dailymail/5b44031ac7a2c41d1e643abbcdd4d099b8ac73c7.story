There was more than one occasion watching England’s 2-2 draw against Ecuador on Wednesday night when I had to blink twice and make sure it was Ross Barkley not Paul Gascoigne who was pulling the strings.

Not since Gascoigne has an England midfield player performed with such panache, vision, skill and bare-faced cheek as Barkley showed in Miami.

There were dribbles, step overs, nutmegs, probing passes and a goal threat – the sorts of things that not only take opponents out of the game and open them up but also make them fearful.

Running the show: The way Ross Barkley beat players against Ecuador was reminiscent of Paul Gascoigne in Italia 90 (below)

Gazza had all those attributes and that is why he is still revered by a generation, especially for how he transformed England at the 1990 World Cup.

But now at last there seems to be a genuine heir, in football terms at least. The manner in which Barkley set up Rickie Lambert for England’s second goal in Miami was straight out of Gazza’s mercurial manual.

The big question is will Roy Hodgson have the balls to unleash Barkley at Brazil 14 as Bobby Robson did Gascoigne at Italia 90?

Judging by Hodgson’s comments in the wake of Wednesday’s game he is not ready to take the ‘gamble’. Yet in many ways his reluctance echoed that of Robson ahead of Italia 90, so perhaps  he is bluffing.

Hodgson has described constant questions about Barkley as an obsession. Robson felt the same way when the press corps kept banging on about Gascoigne.

Bank on Barkley: Roy Hodgson has said it'd be a 'gamble' to play the Everton star but he must start

Of Barkley’s exciting display in 
Miami, Hodgson said: ‘He lost the ball an awful lot of times as well. If
 he’s going to be the player we want him to be he has to make better 
decisions of when he turns with the ball.’

It is what Robson kept saying about Gazza in the build up to Italia 90.

Indeed it should be remembered that Gascoigne, 23 by the start of that tournament, was as much an international rookie as 20-year-old Barkley is now.

Gascoigne had played bit-parts in the qualifiers and it was only in a friendly match against Czechoslovakia in late April that he pushed himself into the frame when he scored one and made three in a 4-2 win at Wembley.

Even then, Robson harboured doubts but when it came to the crunch he went with Gazza’s maverick style rather than the more ‘reliable’ Neil Webb and Steve McMahon.

Maverick style: Gascoigne jinks through the Cameroon defence during the Italia 90 quarter-final

After a dour opening draw against 
Ireland, England came alive in another draw against Holland where 
Gascoigne’s lust for the game and penchant for the unexpected offered 
England a new dimension.

For once a Dutch team playing England looked scared of an opponent who could out play them.

Galvanised by Gazza, England went on to produce some of their best football at a major tournament until losing to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final.

Given the system Hodgson plays, there is actually more margin for ‘error’ by putting Barkley in the team especially if he replaces the jaded and over-hyped Wayne Rooney. Also Barkley’s personality is less erratic than Gascoigne’s, as is his discipline.

Decisions: Roy Hodgson is facing the same quandary over Barkley as Bobby Robson (right) did over Gascoigne

The game breakers - players who have the skill and bravery to take on opponents in the tightest positions - are liable to lose the ball as Barkley did against Ecuador.  It sometimes even still happens to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

But these are the players who raise teams to a different level and put a smile on the face of supporters.

Gascoigne did that for England in 1990 and Barkley can do that this summer.

So what if England can’t win the World Cup? Hodgson, as Robson did, should at least give it a try.

Barkley is an international novice, as Gascoigne was in 1990
