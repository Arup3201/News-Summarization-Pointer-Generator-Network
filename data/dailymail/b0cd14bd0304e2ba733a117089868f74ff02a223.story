A top solicitor shouted 'I'm a fucking lawyer and you can't stop me' when he was told he was too drunk to catch a train, a court heard today.

Roger Harris, 67, then called railway worker Euan Cameron a ‘Scottish a******’ when he confronted the lawyer at a station in the City of London.

Harris, a partner at property specialists Bower Cotton Khaitan, had drank three glasses of wine at the Old Bell in Fleet Street after his train was cancelled.

When he returned to City Thameslink last January 29 to catch a later service he was denied entry to the platforms.

‘Mr Cameron believed for his own safety he shouldn’t be travelling,’ said prosecutor Shazia Ahmed.

‘He advised him to go and sober up. Mr Harris responded by saying, “I’m a f***ing lawyer and you can’t stop me” and trying to push past him.’

The two began struggling and Harris then struck out at Mr Cameron, pushing him in the chest.

The lawyer continued hurling insults as he was detained and arrested, at one point telling the victim he was a ‘Scottish a******’.

He added: ‘Do you know what I do with a******* like you? I will roll you up and throw you out. I’m a f***ing lawyer.’

Harris was arrested at the scene and 
kept in a police cell for seven hours until he was released in the early
 hours of a January night this year.

Mr Cameron said: ‘It left me feeling shocked. I absented myself from work the day after the incident.’

Harris asked for his case to be heard at the Old Bailey, where he admitted assault by beating.

He was cleared of a more serious charge of racially aggravated assault after prosecutors offered no evidence.

Judge Charles Wide QC fined him £350 and ordered him to pay £100 compensation and £85 court costs.

He said: ‘This was utterly disgraceful.

‘There you are, a 67-year-old man of good character and good standing, under the influence of drink.

‘People doing public service, as Mr Cameron was, deserve the protection of the courts and will get it.’

Jonathan Gold, defending, said: ‘He’s a person that has been very successful in life and not a person prone to this.

'He called Mr Cameron every name under the sun and one of them happened to refer to where he was from.’

The Old Bailey heard how Harris called the railway worker a 'Scottish a*******'

'There was no affect on Mr Cameron at all. It’s very much an petulant push rather than any serious intention to cause any harm.'

He asked for the judge to impose a lenient sentence because he claimed the lawyer earns just £2,000 a month.

Harris, from Ardingly, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, admitted assault by beating.

He was found not guilty of racially aggravated common assault - a charge he denied - after prosecutors offered no evidence.
