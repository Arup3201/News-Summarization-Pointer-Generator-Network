Hero firefighter Jimmy Martinez was off duty when he saw the first aircraft crash into the World Trade Center 13 years ago before racing to his assigned station house in Staten Island. 

Now the 24-year veteran is facing a life-or-death battle with a rare form of blood cancer, which he believed was caused by breathing toxic dust from the scene of the disaster. Such was the rush to get to Ground Zero, many of Martinez's colleagues didn't even have basic safety equipment such as masks or respirators.

The 54-year-old firefighter was diagnosed last year with multiple myeloma in June 2013 and now needs a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. 

Firefighter Jimmy Martinez believes his cancer was caused by breathing in toxic dust from 9/11 

As soon as Jimmy Martinez saw the second aircraft crash he raced to Ground Zero to help with the rescue

Martinez said the area was covered by toxic dust but his main thoughts were about rescuing other people 

Since his diagnosis, the father of three has undergone five intensive rounds of chemotherapy, but requires stem cell treatment to control the incurable disease. 

Six members of his firehouse died on 9/11 while four others have gone on to develop cancer.

New research has shown that emergency service personnel who spent long periods of time at Ground Zero following the disaster have a 20 per cent higher change of developing cancer compared with the general population.  

A study published in The Lancet in 2011 proved the link between working at Ground Zero and an elevated cancer risk. 

The Fire Department of New York even lists the names of men who have died from cancer linked to 9/11 on a memorial to their fallen colleagues.  

Now the firefighter is trying to encourage people to sign up to a national bone marrow register in order to help sufferers like himself. 

Speaking to Fox News, Martinez said: 'I knew that there was potential for great harm, but I just didn’t think it would come in the form of cancer as multiple myeloma years later. So now I’m no longer fighting fires, I’m basically fighting for my life, hoping for a donor.'

He added: 'In my firehouse alone, over the last few years, including myself, there have been five men diagnosed with cancer; two with multiple myeloma, one with leukemia, one lymphoma and one with lung cancer

'So if you multiply that by all the firehouses throughout New York City, I think you start to get a picture of what we’re dealing with here.' 

Six members of his old firehouse in Brooklyn died on 9/11 while four others have developed cancer 

He told the Huffington Post that he has no regrets about his actions on 9/11 even though it is responsible for his cancer. 

He said: 'Every firefighter on the job would say if they had to do it all over again, they would. That’s the way it goes. There’s nothing like having a job where you help people for a living. Any time you go out and come across someone in need, you think about your own family.

'And then there's the brotherhood. We work together through thick and thin. Form really strong bonds. I don’t know too many other jobs out there that offer that. It’s rewarding on so many levels.'

Medics treating Martinez were able to harvest some of his own stem cells and give him a transfusion that has sent the cancer into partial remission. 

But in the longer term he will require a donor. As a result he is involved in a massive awareness raising campaign to get people to join the national bone marrow register. 

Potential donors only need to supply a simple cheek swab which takes only three to five minutes.
