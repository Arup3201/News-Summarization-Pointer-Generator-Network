Germany has demanded justice today following the death of a 17-year-old exchange student who was shot in Montana on Sunday morning.

Diren Dede, from Hamburg, was killed when 29-year-old Markus Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts into his garage after Dede set off home intruder alarms inside. It is not clear what Dede was doing inside the garage.

Julia Reinhardt, spokesman for the 
German consulate in San Fransisco, said the investigation should make it
 clear it is illegal to kill an unarmed juvenile just because he is trespassing.

The German consulate in San Fransisco has demanded justice today after exchange student Diren Dede, 17, was shot to death in the early hours of Sunday

Dede was killed after Markus Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts into his garage after Dede entered and set off intruder alarms. It is not known what Dede was doing in the garage

'We consider what happened completely out of proportion to the probable risk,' Reinhardt added.

Meanwhile Dede's father, Celal, has travelled in Missoula to collect his son's body from his host family. He arrived last night with a family friend but refused to comment on his son's death.

At the time of Dede's killing, the teenager was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and was due to leave the U.S. after the school term ended in just six weeks.

Just days before the fatal shooting, Kaarma told a woman that his house had been broken intoÂ  twice and he had been staying up at night, waiting to shoot an intruder, court records said.

Kaarma's attorney, Paul Ryan, said his 
client plans to plead not guilty to a charge of deliberate homicide 
because Montana law allows homeowners to protect their residences with 
deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed.

There had been a number of break-ins 
in the neighborhood and Kaarma believed the police weren't doing 
anything about it, Ryan said.

'We
 know with no question the individual entered the garage. Kaarma didn't 
know who he was, his intent or whether he was armed,' Ryan said.

Prosecutors allege the 29-year-old wild 
land firefighter shot into his garage without warning after an intruder 
tripped sensors he had installed.

Kaarma
 and his partner have remained in their home since he was released on 
$30,000 bond on Monday. A sign on their front door Wednesday told 
visitors not to ring the bell.

According
 to the Missoulian, Kaarma and his wife have received anonymous death 
threats on Facebook and are now afraid to leave their home.

Just days before Dede was shot dead, Kaarma allegedly told neighbours he had been staying up at night and waiting to shoot an intruder after his house was broken into twice

An official from the German consulate is in Missoula to assist Celal Dede in recovering the body and to meet with local law enforcement and prosecutors, Reinhardt said.

'This is very important to us, and she is there to put pressure on the authorities to investigate thoroughly,' Reinhardt said. 'We don't have any doubt that this will happen.'

Dede's family in Hamburg told the German newspaper Bild the family has lived in Germany since 1977, and Diren has two sisters ages 19 and 21.

He was to be in the U.S. for just another six weeks, but now the family plans a burial in Turkey, the newspaper reported.

Diren Dede played soccer for his Missoula high school and in Germany. His former team in Hamburg was to play a charity match Wednesday to help the family pay for the funeral and other costs.
