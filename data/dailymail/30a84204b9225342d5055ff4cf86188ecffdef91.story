Scandal: A four-year-old girl lived with a foster parent who was a suspected paedophile for two weeks after the council was warned, it emerged today (file picture)

Child protection campaigners have slammed social workers who allowed a four-year-old girl to stay with a foster parent for two weeks after they suspected he might be a paedophile.

Bristol City Council failed to act instantly after police warned them the vulnerable child lived with an alleged sex offender, which the NSPCC believe could have put her at 'serious risk of harm'.

The local authority has spent two months fighting a High Court battle to prevent details of the case being reported.

But Mr Justice Baker found the council was 'unjustified' in trying to keep criticism of its staff secret, and has overturned the gagging order.

'It is in the public interest that these allegations are published,' he said, according to The Sun, who fought the injunction.

Jon Brown, NSPCC head of sexual abuse programmes told MailOnline: 'As soon as there are fears for the safety of a child they should be given the protection they need.

'Any delay could leave them at serious risk of harm. And anyone who works with vulnerable children should be properly vetted to ensure they are going to provide the right level of care and attention.'

A Family Proceedings Court hearing was told how the four-year-old child lived with the unnamed man for three months and then Bristol City Council were approached by police on May 14 2012 to say he was suspected of viewing child pornography.

The same day the girl, called Child A in court papers, told her biological father and her social worker that another child living with the suspected paedophile had tried to throttle her.

Her real father called the police about the strangling, officers then told social services, who failed to act for a day, did not get her seen by a doctor and then the young girl was still sent back to the foster home.

It took Bristol City Council another six days to decide what to do with the girl and then another seven days to remove her from the alleged sex offender's home

The foster father then committed suicide a day later, and it was found he had downloaded explicit pictures of children in 2010 but these offences were only revealed in 2012.

The child was originally sent into foster care because of violence at home.

Her biological father told The Sun: 'I am livid. They said she wasn't safe at home but they put her whee someone had been downloading child abuse images.'

Bristol City Council told MailOnline it takes its child protection duties seriously.

'This has been a very sad case for all involved.

'We have only ever sought the judgment of the court on this case to 
protect the interests of children, which the judge has very properly 
done through his ruling, and which we welcome.

'As soon as it was confirmed the foster father was the prime suspect around the download of indecent images, we took immediate action, with the removal of children from the foster carers’ home.

'We are always determined to learn from experience and are undertaking a thorough evaluation of practice, which will be reviewed independently.

'This will consider if there are any wider issues or learning to be taken from this case.'
