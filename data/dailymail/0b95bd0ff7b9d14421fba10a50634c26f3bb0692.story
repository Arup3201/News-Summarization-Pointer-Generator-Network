Chelsea have been caught up in ANOTHER love scandal after it was reported that the partner of Kevin De Bruyne became embroiled in an affair with team-mate Thibaut Courtois. 

In scenes reminiscent of the scandal surrounding John Terry and Wayne Bridge, Caroline Lijnen allegedly started a relationship with Courtois behind De Bruyne’s back, according to a Belgian gossip magazine story.

Both players are on loan this season. De Bruyne, 22, is set to leave Chelsea this summer after an impressing Werder Bremen. Courtois, 20, on loan at Atletico Madrid, is seen as the long-term successor to Petr Cech.

It is reported that Courtois and De Bruyne’s 20-year-old girlfriend exchanged explicit pictures on Facebook. 

The magazine reports that Caroline 
Lijnen became frustrated at life with De Bruyne in Bremen and moved to 
Madrid where she enjoyed a liaison with Courtois.

De Bruyne was said to be ‘devastated’ upon hearing the news. 

A source in the magazine said: 'In 
the Madrid house she cheated on Kevin. He didn't know anything, but when
 he discovered about it, he went crazy. It was a huge shock for him.’

The Belgium team-mates are said to 
have since rekindled their friendship after holding clear-the-air talks 
before their country’s clash against Macedonia.

And a spokesperson from the Belgium FA claimed they now laugh about it. Press officer Stefan Van Loock told Story, this afternoon: 'We don't deny that there have been private problems between Thibaut Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne.

'But I've talked to both of them and they both confirm this case is closed for them. They have finished the quarrel. The guys talk again to each other and they even make jokes again.

'It's true the national manager has talked to both of them about the case. But it never has had any impact on the Belgian national team. .'It's a shame this case has gone public.'

Belgium boss Marc Wilmots is reported to have acted as peacemaker after visiting both players and reading them the riot act before the match against Macedonia on March 26.
