And then there was one. Arsenal were victorious in Monte Carlo, as many thought they would be. They didn’t win big enough to progress, however, as few thought they would do.

Tasty side, Monaco. Well organised, disciplined, brave, resolute. The region may be famous for speculation and bold gambles, but Jose Mourinho would be proud of the side produced by his compatriot Leonardo Jardim.

This was a pragmatic, impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half.

RATINGS BY ROB DRAPER IN MONACO 

It was horribly tense for Monaco once Aaron Ramsey scored Arsenal’s second with 11 minutes to go — but, once again, in this competition Arsene Wenger’s team lost it in the first leg. That third away goal at the Emirates Stadium was the killer. It was the one Wenger’s players could not match.

Monaco knew they had done the hardest yards in London and ultimately settled for heroic defeat. It was like watching one of Nick Faldo’s fourth-day specials. They played to par, laid up at the big one, didn’t take the course on, and won.

As Arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away, Monaco pressed forward and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then.

Instead, Arsenal were left with hope right until the end, a goal short of the last eight. It is the hope that does for you in the end, of course. It probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs.

The goal that brought Arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in Champions League history came in the 79th minute after Theo Walcott hit a post with a side-footed shot. A rare moment of blind panic saw full back Layvin Kurzawa clear horribly straight to Ramsey. He took a touch and struck it low into the far corner.

Cue pandemonium in the closing stages, not least when referee Svein Oddvar Moen, from Norway, signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time.

Yet, really, Arsenal did little with it. They lumped it in, Monaco hoofed it out. Predictably, Monaco’s hoofs were better than Arsenal’s lumps. It really isn’t their game. Nor is the high-tempo, high-energy, gung-ho rollercoaster that was Tottenham Hotspur’s famous comeback against Inter Milan in the San Siro, a repeat of which may just have rattled the French side.

Four goals and a goalkeeper down at half-time, Tottenham pulled it back to 4-3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time.

Yet they had Gareth Bale in the ranks that night. Arsenal have lovely passers and schemers but nobody who is going to terrify a back four as Bale did.

The best they could offer was Olivier Giroud trying to pretend he was Marouane Fellaini, with Mesut Ozil in the Michael Carrick role. Monaco lapped up his timid floaters. A more furious approach might have disturbed them, but Arsenal lacked that verve. Equally, Monaco’s centre halves, Wallace and Aymen Abdennour, were exceptional — a different league from the Inter team that Tottenham faced.

So it is now down to Manchester City, the last Premier League team standing, to restore English pride and claim a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. They trail 2-1 with a return leg in Barcelona’s Nou Camp. Nobody is holding their breath. They were the rank outsiders going into these rematches.

Aaron Ramsey's strike in the 79th minute was the 300th goal in European competition that Arsenal have scored under Arsene Wenger.

England did not have representation beyond the second round in 2013, either, but twice in three years will be a bitter pill to swallow. Arsenal were the better team last night but then they had to be.

They had significant levels of possession in the second half without really threatening goalkeeper Danijel Subasic for long periods. For Monaco to progress on away goals appears close but, once again, Arsenal deceive. They were never in a winning position, on aggregate, in the 180 minutes of the tie.

Arsenal grew into the game after a flat opening 15 minutes enlivened only by a cross from Hector Bellerin that Giroud headed wide.

The yellow card given to Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez for diving after 41 minutes was a poor decision by Norwegian referee Svein Oddvar Moen.

Maybe the contact wasn’t enough for a penalty but it wasn’t a dive. You can see what Sanchez thought of the referee’s decision!

From there, however, the game began to progress along familiar lines, Arsenal in the ascendancy, Monaco retreating to massed ranks of stout defence. 

For a while it looked as if they were more than capable of holding out — Monaco are a tight defensive unit with that most old-fashioned of qualities, a couple of big units who don’t mind putting a foot in — but Arsenal got a breakthrough after 36 minutes.

It was Danny Welbeck who set up the goal, driving forward and slipping his final pass to Giroud, who was left with only Subasic to beat. 

Giroud’s shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded and struck him on the shoulder.

With Subasic stranded on the floor, Giroud reacted quickest and after scanning the immediate area, seized on the loose ball, rifling it into the roof of the net with Monaco’s covering defenders helpless.

After his travails in the first leg — hooked by Wenger to utter derision, having missed enough chances to put Arsenal in the quarter-finals – this was a perfect response.

 He had at least guaranteed to outstrip the two marks out of ten he previously received from French newspaper L’Equipe.

Just two minutes later, Arsenal could have been further ahead. Alexis Sanchex hit a cross which was cleared under pressure from Giroud and fell to Welbeck whose shot was blocked, sprawling, by Abdennour. Even then, it spun and almost squeaked over the line as Subasic scrambled to recover.

Sanchez was booked for diving, which seemed harsh — it didn’t look like a foul, but not a dive either — and Wenger may take a dim view privately of Ozil’s decision to swap shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia at half-time.

True, it was at Kondogbia’s request, but it hardly fitted in with the cold determination required to conjure victory against a team that had not conceded three goals at home since 2011. 

Sure enough, one of Kondogbia’s first acts of the second half was to go in late on Santi Cazorla, provoking a scream that could be heard all around the Stade Louis II. That was a different kind of souvenir to take home.

From the free-kick Ozil’s dipper was flicked over by Subasic, in no mood to return any favours. So one it is.
