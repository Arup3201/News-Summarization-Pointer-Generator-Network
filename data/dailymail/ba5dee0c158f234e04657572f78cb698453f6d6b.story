A diver has filmed the moment a great white shark appeared out of nowhere and started circling him  off the coast of South Australia.

Chris Rapson, 32, was diving with a group at Glenelg Tyre Reef, an artificial reef near Adelaide, on Sunday when he caught sight of the great white 18 metres below the water.

'One of the other divers mentioned he saw a shark and he decided he was going to surface,' Mr Rapson told MailOnline.

'People say all the time they see them but you never actually do, so we kept exploring the reef.

'Then it appeared out of nowhere.'

The great white was just three or four metres from Mr Rapson and his fellow divers when he decided to follow the deadly shark so he could film it.

'It was poor visibility – you could only see three or four metres. It makes it harder to see and I've heard sharks hunt when it's murky,' he said.

'I wasn't scared… I guess it was pretty crazy.'

The 32-year-old said poor visibility meant the shark appeared out of nowhere and started circling him just four metres away

Mr Rapson, who works for the Australian Army, was eventually pulled back by the other divers but not before he captured the eerie footage.

'We decided to resurface and it kept circling until we got to about 7-8 metres (from the surface),' he said.

'In diving you have to do a safety stop at five metres below the surface for a few minutes but the other divers didn't stop.

'I did and that was the only time I got concerned… great whites actually like to come up and attack from below.'

Mr Rapson has been diving for 18 months but said this was his first encounter with a shark

The divers were on a charter diving boat and managed to exit the water safely despite their close encounter

The divers, who were on a charter diving boat, all managed to exit the water safely.

 'The other divers were shocked, they couldn't believe it. Another guy said he's been diving for 35 years and he's never seen (a shark),' he said.

It was the Keswick resident's first encounter with a shark since he started diving 18 months ago and it was the second time he has dived at Glenelg Tyre Reef.

Mr Rapson works for the Australian Army and lives in the Adelaide suburb of Keswick
