St Mirren are close to being sold to a consortium of Argentinian investors spearheaded by lawyer Ricardo Pini in a deal worth £1.5million.

Sportsmail understands that an agreement has been been reached in principle - and funds for the sale of shares are expected to change hands this week.

Chairman Stewart Gilmour, vice-chairman George Campbell, director Bryan McAusland, former secretary Allan Marshall and Evelyn Purves, widow of former director Jim, put their 52 per cent stake in the club up for sale in 2009.

Former directors Ken McGeouch and Gordon Scott are also expected to sell their shares – giving the new owners a 75 per cent majority stake in the club.

Pini and his brother Sebastien were given a tour of St Mirren Park and the club’s Ralston training ground with Scottish agent Neil Murray last month.

The two were previously involved with Chilean club Rangers de Talca, before selling their shares last year following the club’s relegation to the country’s second flight.

After failing to buy Motherwell, their deal to buy Premiership St Mirren will be completed following the collapse of ‘advanced talks’ between the Paisley club and an English consortium last week.

Those negotiations floundered when one of the group, 52-year-old Thavar Mohammed, was found to have a conviction for fraud.

It’s understood, however, that the offer from the Argentine group is higher than that of the English group.

The deal will place the future of caretaker manager Gary Teale under scrutiny – with the South Americans likely to install their own manager.

Former River Plate coach Guillermo Almada, a Uruguayan, is the bookmakers favourite for the post, with former Newcastle United icon and retired Peruvian international Nolberto Solano also interviewed by the group and a potential name for the job.
