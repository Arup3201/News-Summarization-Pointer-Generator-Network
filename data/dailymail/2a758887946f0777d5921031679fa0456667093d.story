This breathtaking set of pictures captures the skyscrapers Hong Kong from the perspective of the mass of humanity which swarms at their feet.

French graphic artist Romain Jacquet-Lagrèze captured the vertigo-inducing vistas on a visit to the city, which he credits with inspiring within him a passion for photography.

'It's easy to get a measure of a building from afar, but you can't really appreciate a towering city structure until you've craned your neck up the length of its spine, admiring the way its reflective edges seem to scrape the sky,' he said.

With a population of seven million squeezed into an area of just 426 square-miles, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

That lack of living space, combined with a vibrant capitalist economy based on low taxation and light-touch regulation, spurred demand for ever denser constructions which have made it the world's most vertical city.

Stunned by this architectural 'race to the sky', Mr Jacquet-Legrèze says he felt the need to use his camera to create this set of pictures, entitled Vertical Horizon, to share his feelings about the city.

'Hong Kong is not a 2-D place that follows the flatness of a map but instead a volumetric place, where elevators leading us to restaurants, shops, home or our working place should deserve their own street names,' he said.

'Vertical Horizon is a reminder on how we are nothing more than a bee in the big beehive, chipping in our bit into the greater realm of society.'

Mr Jacquet-Lagrèze is a French graphic artist with a Masters in multimedia and art from East Paris University. His interest in photography began during his period of working in Los Angeles and Tokyo, and subsequently blossomed into a passion after his arrival in Hong Kong.

He said it's the geometry of the urban environment and the vivid lives it shelters which are the aspects of Hong Kong that inspire him most.

Light at the end of the tunnel: He says he felt the need to create this

about the city's 'race to the sky'

'The angles in which I make the shots emphasize the large scale of the structures around us in contrast to our own little being,' he said. 'Being conscious of our humble condition, to me, is the first step to move to our full potential and reach for our vertical horizon.

'The name Vertical Horizon is an obvious reminder of our competitive Hong Kong skyline where each building is trying to be the tallest, the boldest, the most beautiful, the youngest, the oldest or the most famous.'

Looking down: Despite the cramped living 
conditions and cut-throat economy, Hong Kong ranks highly for its quality of life and on the 
Human Development Index

Mass of humanity: The city state, which passed 
from British to Chinese rule in 1997, also has the highest
 average IQ score out of a survey 81 countries around the world

The remarkable city state, which passed from British hands to nominal Chinese rule in 1997, has numerous high international rankings in various aspects.

Its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, and Human Development Index are all ranked highly by international bodies.

According to estimates from both United Nations and the World Health Organisation, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world last year.

It also has the highest average IQ score out of a survey 81 countries around the world.
