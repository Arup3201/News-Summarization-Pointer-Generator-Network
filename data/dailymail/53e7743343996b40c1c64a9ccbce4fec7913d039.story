Former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel has sparked speculation that he could make a return to the club after posting on his official Twitter account that he was on his way to Merseyside.

The 27-year-old still remains a popular figure among the Liverpool faithful after proving to be a useful squad player during his four years at the club.

Since leaving the Reds in 2011 the Holland forward has since gone on to play for 1889 Hoffenheim and Ajax, as well as his current side Kasımpaşa S.K.

Babel is arguably still in his peak and could still have his best years ahead of him after struggling over the past few seasons.

With that in mind he could still be worth taking a look at if Brendan Rodgers is keen on adding a utility forward to his ranks, with Babel's pace and keen eye for goal his key attributes to watch out for.

Elsewhere, Liverpool have agreed a fee of £8.5 million for QPR striker Loic Remy. The Frenchman scored 15 goals in 30 appearances on loan at Newcastle last season, and with Luis Suarez departing Anfield for Barcelona, Brendan Rodgers views the 27-year-old as the ideal replacement for him.
