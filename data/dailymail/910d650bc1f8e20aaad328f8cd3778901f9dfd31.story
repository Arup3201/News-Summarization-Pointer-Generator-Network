Hundreds of French schoolchildren left stuck on a ferry stranded in the English Channel for more than 24 hours finally made it home last night.

The Oscar Wilde had been delayed from its arrival at Cherbourg, France, from Ireland by more than 24 hours after rough seas prevented a safe dock despite five attempts.

And just when the estimated 500 passengers thought their ordeal was over, the Irish Ferries ship doors failed to open. They were forced to wait a further four hours for engineers to fix the problem.

Most of the 500 passengers were French schoolchildren returning to Cherbourg (pictured) from a trip to Ireland

At least 100 vehicles, including several trucks, were involved in the pile-up on the autobahn in Germany

The journey from Ireland to France was meant to be overnight but ended up taking two days.

Treacherous conditions in the English Channel prevented the Oscar Wilde - the company’s luxury flagship - from docking at the French port as scheduled on Monday at 2pm.

But when it finally berthed after five attempts yesterday - 24 hours later than expected - the seafarers anxious to disembark were forced to remain onboard a further four hours when the boat’s bow doors jammed.

Irish Ferries blamed 'a hydraulic failure' for preventing them from letting passengers - including 245 French pupils returning from a school trip to Ireland - back onto dry land.

Normally in such circumstances a ship would sail back out of its berth and reverse in again so passengers could alight through the stern, or rear, door.

But because conditions in the English
Channel remained dangerous, harbour authorities warned the ship's captain
against moving the ferry.

A total of 245 French school pupils were among those onboard.

Snow and freezing temperatures made travel difficult for commuters

Hundreds of flights were cancelled after Frankfurt airport was closed yesterday afternoon

It was one of a series of weather-related travel problems in Western Europe in the past 48 hours.

At least 20 people were injured, six 
seriously, after an horrendous 100-car pile-up on 
the autobahn near Munzenberg, Germany, caused by the treacherous 
conditions.

Meanwhile, 
Frankfurt airport closed at midday yesterday after recording about five inches of 
snow with more than 100 flights already cancelled and many others 
delayed.

In Paris, a quarter of outbound flights were cancelled at Charles de Gaulle airport and Belgium has seen a record 1,000 miles of traffic jams during morning rush hour.

Spokesman Hagen Vetter said Autobahn 45 in Germany looked 'like a battlefield' following the horrific crash yesterday afternoon.

The
motorway was completely shut down in both directions while rescue 
services tried to pick through the wreckage to reach those inside, some 
of whom had to be cut out.

Heavy drifting snow had already led to several accidents in the area before the collision.

Commuters choose to go by bicycle in Antwerp, Belgium, rather than get caught in traffic

Office buildings in the French capital - like those in the European Union's capital, Brussels - were only partly full and high-speed trains are stuck in their stations.

The
French train network SNCF urged commuters in the Paris region to stay 
home instead of trying to reach downtown 'because of the unfavorable 
evolution of weather conditions.'

Paris airport screens flashed with red 
warnings after the French civil aviation authority ordered 25 per cent of
flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport canceled, and 20 per cent of 
flights out of Orly Airport.

Instead of the onset of spring, Belgium had a record 1,000 miles of traffic jams during morning rush hour as snowdrifts turned roads slippery and reduced vision. A strong wind made conditions even tougher.

Thousands of commuters were left stranded on snowed-in platforms after many trains from Belgium were canceled, including some of the Thalys high-speed trains to France, Germany and the Netherlands.

Roads around northern France were blocked by snow or closed by transport authorities, and trucks were banned from several routes.

Nearly 500 cars were blocked near Cherbourg where snowdrifts piled up almost two feet and winds reached more than 60 mph.
