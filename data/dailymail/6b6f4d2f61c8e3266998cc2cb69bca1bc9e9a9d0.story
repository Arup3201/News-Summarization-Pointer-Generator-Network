West Ham want the Premier League to take firm action against Fulham if it is proved they tapped up Ravel Morrison.

The midfielder is at the centre of a row between the clubs after Fulham head coach Rene Meulensteen said he knew that Morrison, 20, wanted to move to Craven Cottage and confirmed that their bid for him had been rejected by West Ham.

It is understood that Fulham offered £7.5million for Morrison and midfield partner Mo Diame, which was dismissed by West Ham, who value Morrison alone at £10m.

West Ham claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move.

After Fulham beat Norwich 3-0 in their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday, Meulensteen said an offer for Morrison had been ‘knocked back’ and added: ‘Yes. He does want to come here.’

Asked how he knew, Meulensteen, who worked with Morrison at Old Trafford, responded: ‘I’ve known him obviously for a long, long time.’

West Ham are understood to want swift action against their fellow relegation strugglers, who are 16th, one place and one point above them.

On Wednesday Fulham issued a statement which read: ‘When asked the question regarding the player Ravel Morrison in last night’s press conference, Rene Meulensteen answered honestly, that a bid had been made to West Ham United for the player and that the bid had been rejected.’

Morrison has 18 months left on his current deal worth £15,000 a week and contract talks to improve it broke down last month.

It has emerged that a clause in Morrison’s contract means his wages leap to £60,000 if an offer of £10m is lodged and he has made his desire to leave clear to friends.

At a press conference last week West Ham manager Sam Allardyce denied the player had told him he wanted to move to Fulham but added: ‘I’m not surprised there’s another rumour about Ravel Morrison.’

He is West Ham’s top scorer with five goals in all competitions but has played only once since December 21, with a groin injury given as the reason for his absence.

A Premier League spokesman  confirmed that a complaint had been received from West Ham and that they are looking into the matter.

Both clubs will be asked for their observations and the League will decide if Fulham have broken any rules.

Carlton Cole has signed a new 18-month contract after his short-term deal ran out on Monday. His wages are in the region of £40,000.

It represents a remarkable turn-around since last summer when the former England striker was regarded as surplus to requirements but he has  scored four goals in 11 league games since October.

‘I’m really happy,’ said Cole. ‘I’ve worked hard to get to the position I’m in right now. I just want to help the team push on and get further up the table.’

Andy Rolls, West Ham’s head of sports science, has beaten off stiff competition to land a role at Arsenal as one of four first-team physios.

Sportsmail understands that Rolls decided to quit his job last October, long before Hammers co-owner David Sullivan questioned the medical advice behind signing Andy Carroll.

Sullivan said Carroll would not have been signed had they known he would be out for so long, adding: ‘When we signed him we were assured by the medical staff that the very, very latest he would be back was September 1.’
