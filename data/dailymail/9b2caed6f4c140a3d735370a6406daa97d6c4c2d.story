Rampage: Truc Hyunh attacked a customer who complained about bad service before brandishing a butter knife at officers and kicking them as she was dragged away

An Idaho waitress was arrested after hitting a customer, threatening cops with a butter knife and then kick them as she was hauled out of a Vietnamese restaurant where she worked, police said.

Truc Hyunh’s rampage Saturday afternoon at Pho 79, in Boise, started when a customer complained of bad service – she hit the customer in the face, authorities said.

Hyunh, 29, told KBOI the wild waitress has a history of problems and that she spent three months in a hospital last year, they hope she gets help after this latest incident.

‘She hit the customer. I hear boom. I go out and tell her no no no,’ Pho 79 owner Henry Do recalled to KBOI.

Police soon showed up, and officers noticed ‘physical evidence of the battery on the victim, including a bruise on the victim's jaw,’ according to a Boise Police press release.

The cops confronted her in the kitchen and she pulled a butter knife on them, Do recalled.

Do was standing in the doorway to the dining room and they were standing in a small area barely big enough for three people when she became aggressive, he said.

Hyunh grabbed the knife, positioned herself in ‘a fighting stance and verbally challenged the officers,’ police said.

Grand exit: Hyunh reportedly kicked the officers who dragged her out of the establishment

They eventually convinced the mother of five to put the knife down and arrested her, but she repeatedly kicked police as she was dragged out, both Do and authorities said.

She was charged with felony battery on a police officer, misdemeanor resisting arrest and obstructing an officer, authorities said.

Both the customer and Do declined to press charges, but Hyunh was booked into the ADA County Jail and has yet to be released.

Do said told KBOI she no longer works at the restaurant though.

‘If she come back? No,’ he said while shaking his head.
