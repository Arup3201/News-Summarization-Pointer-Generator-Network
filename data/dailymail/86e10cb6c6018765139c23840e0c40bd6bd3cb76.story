Liverpool stars spread some early festive joy as they delivered Christmas gifts to the children at Alder Hey Hospital on Thursday afternoon.

The entire team paid a visit to the wards, where young patients were delivered presents by their sporting idols such as Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling.

The squad split into five groups to ensure that no child was left empty handed.

Club captain Gerrard said: 'I have been visiting Alder Hey for many years now and it is such a special place. Our visit is always a day of mixed emotions but it's always nice to meet the children and their families and create as many smiles as we can.

'It's important to the players and the club to give something back and provide positivity to our young fans, many of whom are facing tough times.'

Manager Brendan Rodgers added: 'Our Christmas visits to Alder Hey are always very special and memorable. It's a privilege for the team to have the opportunity to meet with the children and their families to show their support.

'It's great that our visit can bring so much happiness to those that need a little lift, which is very important to me, the players and the club.'
