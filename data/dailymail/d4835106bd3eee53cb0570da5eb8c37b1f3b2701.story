Mugshot: Michael Turner was charged with DUI and speeding early Tuesday, shortly after the Falcons beat the Denver Broncos.

Atlanta Falcons running back Michael Turner was hit with drunken driving charges right after his team defeated the Denver Broncos during their Monday Night Football contest.

Turner was jailed on charges of DUI and speeding early Tuesday - hours after he scored a touchdown in the team's win over Denver.

Turner, 30, of Suwanee, Georgia, was booked into the Gwinnett County jail in metro Atlanta just after 5am.

He spent barely two hours behind bars before he was released on $2,179 bond, jail records showed.

A Gwinnett County police officer pulled over Turner's black Audi R8 on Interstate 85 northeast of Atlanta after clocking the car's speed at 97 mph - 32 mph over the speed limit, said Cpl Edwin Ritter, a police spokesman.

'The officer made contact with the driver who identified himself as 30-year-old Michael Turner of the Atlanta Falcons,' Ritter said in a news release.

'The officer could smell an odor of alcoholic beverage coming from the driver and proceeded to conduct a DUI investigation.'

No other details were immediately available.

Hours before his arrest, Turner and the Falcons celebrated a 27-21 home victory over Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos.

Manning’s first loss as a Denver Bronco came after the veteran quarterback threw an interception in each of Denver’s first three possessions.

Turner scored the Falcons' first touchdown after jumping over a pileup of Atlanta and Denver linemen in the first quarter.

It was Turner's 51st touchdown for the Falcons, a team he joined in 2008 after four seasons with the San Diego Chargers.

Last year, Turner rushed for 1,340 yards and 11 touchdowns.
