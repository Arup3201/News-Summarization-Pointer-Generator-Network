A Christmas tree that might make Charlie Brown think twice is getting kicked to the curb a little early after residents of a Pennsylvania town complained it was too ugly.

Reading's spindly 50-foot spruce drew the ire of residents who said it was ruining their holiday spirit.

Now a group led by the city council president is raising money to buy and decorate a more impressive replacement. The current tree is topped with a lighted pretzel, a nod to the area's many bakeries.

That's no tree!: Pennsylvania residents look on during the Christmas the tree lighting but can't help but be disturbed by the tree's lackluster look 

Outraged: 'It’s nasty, it’s pathetic and they shouldn't have it here,' resident Martin McNeil told reporters 

The puny pine was a last-minute stand-in taken from a city park. The city had planned to get its tree from a farm, but the owner wouldn't let the crews drive on the wet ground when they went to pick it up.

Officials are hoping to have a do-over tree lighting ceremony next weekend.

'It’s nasty, it’s pathetic and they shouldn't have it here,' resident Martin McNeil told Fox.

McNeil said not even a squirrel would climb in the tree whose leaves have already begun falling.

Another angered resident spoke her mind in Spanish with a fiery fervor that could be understood by anyone. 

A community has raised about $1,000 to pay for a spiffier Christmas pine.

They’re looking for a total of $5,000 to pay for the decorations and other expenses.

Dying: Leaves of the unpopular Christmas tree in Pennsylvania have already begun falling on the ground 

Fury: This resident spewed hated of the tree in Spanish but any language speaker could gather the meaning
