Germany ended 24 years of hurt on Sunday night by winning the World Cup – and the players wasted no time in celebrating the achievement.

Mario Gotze’s goal in extra time won Germany their fourth World Cup – and first as a united nation – as they beat Argentina 1-0 at the Maracana.

Joachim Low and his players partied with the trophy in Rio de Janeiro after the game and were joined by their wives and girlfriends.
