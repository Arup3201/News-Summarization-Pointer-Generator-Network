When it comes to a beloved child's birthday, parents have long gone all out to ensure that their day is as special as possible.

But it seems that pleasing the little darlings is setting parents back more than ever, as the typical cost of a children’s birthday party rises to more than £214.

On average, a parent will fork out an average of £214.54 per party, while 64 per cent say they want to ensure their child enjoys a ‘super sweet 16’ style bash every single birthday.

Extravagant: Parents are so desperate to please their children and outdo their friends that they spend, on average, £214 per party

Research found a third of mothers and fathers splash out on their children's birthday bash to guarantee it is ‘better than their friend's’.

And the pressure is so great for one in 11 parents (nine per cent) that they would spend a staggering £800 - at least - on a party for their child.

The study looked at the growing trend of hugely extravagant celebrations thrown by parents for their children's birthdays.

So fancy are some birthday parties that two per cent of the 1,000 parents surveyed said their child has received an iPod in their party bag.

Furthermore, 16 per cent said their child had found make-up in their party bag, while four per cent had received gift vouchers.

And as part of the research, children aged between 5-13 were also polled to find out the criteria for the perfect party.

According to the young respondents, the ideal party would be held at a theme park and last five hours eight minutes, with 30 guests invited.

Meanwhile, the bash should also involve them receiving 17 presents, lunch at Nando’s and even a guest appearance from footballer David Beckham.

Interestingly though, children would rather their grandparents, 47 per cent, and school friends, 67 per cent, attend their party than One Direction.

In contrast, the study also asked the parents polled how their children’s parties differ to the ones they had when they were growing up.

Perfect combination: Children voted their top birthday party would see David Beckham in attendance and be held at a theme park with lunch at Nando's

One in five, 21 per cent, admitted they didn’t even have a birthday party while growing up.

And those who did said on their gift list were items such as clothes, board games and outdoor activity games - not televisions and games consoles.

Gary Kibble, from Littlewoods.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'Though the blueprint for the ideal party is quite staggering, parents needn’t feel under pressure to make these parties become reality.

'It’s great if parents can include some elements of the blueprint in their kids’ parties but it’s not essential to have them all, like David Beckham attending.

'What is refreshing from this research, is children put immediate family and close friends higher up on their guest list than their favourite celebs.'

The only way is pop: The children would also love to see One Direction at their party and have Justin Bieber's music on repeat
