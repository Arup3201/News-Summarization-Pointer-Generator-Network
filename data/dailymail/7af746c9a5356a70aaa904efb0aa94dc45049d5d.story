Danny Cipriani's England recall will be confirmed on Wednesday when Sale's fly-half is included – along with Nick Easter – among the replacements named by Stuart Lancaster for the clash with Wales.

The 27-year-old playmaker forced his way back into the national squad last month on the back of a series of outstanding performances for his club this season. 

Now, with Owen Farrell missing from the entire RBS 6 Nations after suffering a knee injury, Cipriani has earned the right to a bench place, as understudy to the starting No 10, George Ford.

This selection represents a triumph for dogged perseverance and the consistency of his form for Sale, despite the disappointment of being omitted from the England squad for the autumn series at Twickenham last November. 

It also provides encouragement that a place in the World Cup squad is there for the taking, which should in turn further reduce the fading chance of Cipriani taking up the option of a move to France, which would leave him in Test exile.

Last June, he won two caps in New Zealand, following a period of five-and-a-half years spent off England's radar – during which time he had a spell with Melbourne Rebels in Australia. 

Cipriani's last appearance in the Six Nations came way back in March 2008, when he shone against Ireland on his full debut at Twickenham – scoring 18 points in a compelling personal display.

Easter is being similarly rewarded for refusing to believe that his international career was over, even at the age of 36. 

The Harlequins No 8 has been an enduring force at club level since his last Test appearance, in the quarter-final defeat by France that heralded the end of England's ill-fated 2011 World Cup campaign.

Now, in the absence of Gloucester's Ben Morgan – who is recovering from a broken leg – he will have an opportunity to make his presence felt from the bench and, in the process, reignite his own prospects of being a part of the global tournament later this year.
