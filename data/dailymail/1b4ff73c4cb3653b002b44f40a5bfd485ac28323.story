Aston Villa chief executive Tom Fox insists the club will not bow to pressure from fans to axe manager Paul Lambert.

The 45-year-old Scot has come under fire after Villa picked up just three points from their last seven Premier League games, slipping to 15th place in the table. Their next two fixtures are against Arsenal and Chelsea.

But Fox believes it would be wrong for him and owner Randy Lerner to put all the blame on Lambert's shoulders, and that sacking him would be a gamble no different to 'flipping a coin'.

The Villa chief added: 'When things aren't going well, fans bay for that type of blood. That's not the way that I or the owner are going to make a decision.

'I think football's a funny business and I think to put it all on the manager, again, that's a bit of a false narrative.

'There's a lot of things happening at this football club, and clearly what happens on the pitch is a focal point. Clearly the manager is the one person who can really influence that, so everyone focuses on it.

'Our focus for the last couple of months has been on making sure we support Paul to make us as successful as possible, and I think we're heading in the right direction.'

Lerner, who is prepared to sell Villa eight-and-a-half years after buying the club for £62million, has also faced criticism. 

However, Fox said: 'I don't think he's a motivated seller right now. I think he'll want to make sure that he's put Aston Villa on the best possible path for the future.'
