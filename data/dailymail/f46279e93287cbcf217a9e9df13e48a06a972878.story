Police in Arizona have arrested the mother and stepfather of an 8-year-old girl who was kidnapped and murdered last month on drug charges, accusing them of supplying methamphetamine to their daughter's killer.

A police SWAT team arrested 29-year-old Tania Ann Grogan and her husband, 28-year-old Ralph Pat Leroy Folster III, at their home in Bullhead City Wednesday evening. 

Folster initially refused to surrender to police but was taken into custody after a two-hour standoff at their residence in the 2400 block of Lakeside Drive.

Innocent: Isabella Grogan-Cannella, 8, was kidnapped and killed on September 1 in Bullhead City, Arizona

Arrest: A SWAT team descended on Grogan's home Wednesday after getting a tip about her alleged drug trade

Standoff: Folster initially refused to surrender and tried to escape, but eventually turned himself in 

According to investigators, the 28-year-old man had made an attempt to flee by going up to the attic and then attempting to climb into a unit next door before he finally gave himself up, MyNews3 reported.

Police say they learned the couple were dealing heroin and methamphetamine last month. They were booked on drug sales and possession charges, and Grogan faces an additional charge of manufacturing meth.

Detectives told AZCentral they believe Mrs Grogan likely furnished Rector with meth prior to the September tragedy. 

The mother is also being investigated for keeping her children in a dangerous environment. 

The body of Grogan's daughter, Isabella Grogan-Cannella, was discovered on September 3, a day after she was reported missing from her home.

Justin Rector, a 26-year-old family friend, has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping, child abuse and abandonment of a body. 

Rector is accused of abducting, sexually assaulting and murdering Grogan-Cannella in Bullhead City, after she went missing during a game of hide-and-seek late on the night of September 1.

The child was found two days later buried in a shallow grave, naked from the waist down.

Rector, who has been held in custody without a bond, now faces 35 years to life in prison for the charge of first-degree murder, and a possible 10 to 24 years for the alleged kidnapping, assault, and abandonment of a dead body.

A probable cause affidavit released last month stated that Rector told police that he had been smoking methamphetamine in an upstairs bedroom of his mother's home where Bella lived with her family.

Rector had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of September 1, Police Chief Brian Williamson said after the suspect's arrest.

Bella's 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw the girl with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. 

Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am.

Later that morning, Rector allegedly stole clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said.

Police arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance.

When her body was found on September 3, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said.

An autopsy determined that the little girl died of asphyxiation by strangulation.  

Rector has a long criminal history, including more than a dozen arrests in the past 10 years.

Just hours after Bella was reported missing, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect.

'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote.

Police have suggested that Grogan supplied meth to her friend, Rector, before he allegedly killed her daughter

'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.'

Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives.

In early September, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up.

Bella lived at the Bullhead City residence with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father does not live in the area.

Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs.

Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was ultimately found as relatives held each other and wiped away tears.

The girl was discovered wearing the same green, ruffled, sparkly tank top she had on when she was last seen, police said. However, authorities said she didn't have any clothing on her lower half, and they still are looking into whether she was the victim of sexual assault.
