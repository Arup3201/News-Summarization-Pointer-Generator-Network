Manchester United have quashed reports in Spain that they triggered Atletico Madrid defender Miranda's £24million release clause.

The 29-year-old centre-half played in the Champions League final extra time defeat against city rivals Real in Lisbon on Saturday.

Miranda was a mainstay for Diego Simeone's La Liga champions last season and Barcelona were also interested.

Key man: The Brazilian has been important for Diego Simeone during their La Liga title last season

Atletico are attempting to cash in on a player who will be 30 in September.

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari didn't pick the big defender in his World Cup squad - a decision that has come as a surprise given Miranda's recent performances.

Van Gaal has identified the heart of his
 defence as a problem area, particularly after the departures of Rio 
Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic has left the squad devoid of numbers.

Miranda is enjoying a renaissance on the continent since moving to Vicente Calderon three years ago.

He did move back to Brazil with Sao Paulo in 2006 after ill-fated one-season spells with Coritiba and Sochaux.

United have also continued to keep tabs on Paris Saint-Germain's Adrien Rabiot, who wants to leave the club over a lack of games.

The 19-year-old is highly thought of in France and is the source of interest from Premier League clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea.

He is one half of the best central defensive partnership in Europe and if Manchester United do manage to land him they will have some player. Think Ricardo Carvalho in the John Terry/Carvalho partnership in Jose Mourinho’s first spell at Chelsea.

Diego Godin is Atletico's Terry – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots, sliding into tackles and heading in set-pieces - while alongside him Miranda is the cool head; the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong. You don’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time.

Most commentators in Spain believe Miranda has been the best defender in La Liga this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his Atletico team-mate Felipe Luis have been left out of the Brazil squad – all the better for United who will get a player who has rested throughout the summer having put in the season of his career.

Six times Lionel Messi faced Miranda this season and the Argentine failed to scored, played out of the game by the 29-year-old who was consistently voted best defender in Brazil before Jorge Mendes helped bring him to Atletico Madrid from Sao Paolo in January 2011.

As well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals, giving Atletico the Spanish Cup last season by notching the winner at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid.

The fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone’s eye this season extends to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. The World Cup-winning manager enquired over the defender’s international status. Unfortunately for Spain, he had already played full internationals with Brazil and can’t follow Diego Costa in making the switch to Spain.
