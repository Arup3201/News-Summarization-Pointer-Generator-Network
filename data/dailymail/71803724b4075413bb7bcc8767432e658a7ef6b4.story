Title favourites Chelsea drew 1-1 with 10-man Manchester City after Frank Lampard came off the bench to salvage a point for the hosts against his former employers.

Here, Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players

MANCHESTER CITY 

JOE HART 6.5 - Not called seriously into action before the goal, largely thanks to the defending in front of him.

PABLO ZABALETA 7  - Got through some good work down the right hand side and teamed up well with James Milner. Rash tackle for second booking.

VINCENT KOMPANY 8 - A super example of leadership and intelligent defending from City’s captain. Won his duel with Diego Costa.

ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7.5 - A debut for the new signing and an impressive one, too. Looked like he had partnered Kompany for years.

ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 7 - Not always the cutest defender but doesn’t make mistakes either. A solid afternoon.

FERNANDINHO 7.5 - City’s most important holding player, the Brazilian was terrific again here.

YAYA TOURE 7.5 - Much improved after the horrors of Munich but couldn’t get forward effectively once City had ten

Frank Lampard scores against his former club but declines to celebrate his vital strike in the 1-1 draw 

JAMES MILNER 7 - An under-rated player by many people but came in and did a good job here. Delicate touch to set up equaliser.

EDIN DZEKO 7 - Relishing in an increased amount of game town and looked more dangerous than Aguero.

DAVID SILVA 6.5 - Couldn’t quite see enough of the ball to regularly hurt Chelsea but involved in equaliser.

SERGIO AGUERO 6.5 - Still doesn’t look himself after a run of injuries. Will get sharper with games.

SUBS : Sagna 6, Navas 6, Lampard  7

CHELSEA

THIBAUT COURTOIS 7 - Not worked overly hard but good low save from Aguero early in the second half. Dependable.

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 7 - A reliable influence on this Chelsea team, the big full-back rarely lets his team down.

GARY CAHILL 7 - Looks a better player than he is because of the influence of John Terry. It’s a partnership that works, though.

John Terry, pictured here confronting David Silva, proved he is still one of England's best defenders on his day 

JOHN TERRY 8 - On days like his he still looks like one of the best defenders in the country. Big games bring the best from him.

CESAR AZPILICUETA 7 - Still finding his way in this team but did a reasonable job on stifling the threat of Milner and Zabaleta down his side

CESC FABREGAS 6.5 - He is important to Chelsea’s rhythm and rarely wasted the ball. Lacked a decisive influence though.

NEMANJA MATIC 6.5 - Similarly, Matic’s importance to Chelsea is growing and he is dangerous when breaking.

WILLIAN 6.5 - Couldn’t see enough of the ball in the time he had on the field. Lacked some subtlety too.

RAMIRES 6 - Worked hard as always, especially in the first half when City had more of the ball.

EDEN HAZARD 7.5 - Coveted by City at one point, the Belgian has a devastating turn of pace over five years and worried the home team constantly with his direct running.

Eden Hazard provided the valuable assist for Schurrle during another impressive performance for the Blues 

DIEGO COSTA 7 - Suffered at the hands of the brilliant Kompany but managed to free himself long enough to feel Hazard in the run-up to the goal. 

SUBS: Mikel 6, Schurrle 7, Drobga, 6 

REFEREE: Mike Dean 5.5 - Too many cards in the first half meant that a red card was always a distinct possibility.
