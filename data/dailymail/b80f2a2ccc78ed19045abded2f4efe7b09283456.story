A determined great blue heron holds on tightly to its prey as a furry gopher attempts to wriggle free.

With all its tiny might, the rodent manages to pull its paw free from the clutch of the huge heron's beak.

This moment was caught by professional photographer Daniel Dietrich, 44, in Point Reyes, California.

Beak condition: A determined great blue heron holds on tightly to a furry gopher as it attempts to wriggle free

Seized: The heron grabs the unsuspecting gopher as it scuttles along a road

No escape: The heron is far too powerful for the gopher - but at least the rodent puts up a fight

Daniel, of Point Reyes but originally from New York, says: 'The blue heron first attempted to spear the gopher with its beak while the rodent retreated into its burrow.

'After failing to catch its dinner, the heron then used its beak to rummage further in the hole, before pulling the pocket gopher out by its front, left paw.

'The dangling gopher put up a good fight, however, and pulled his trapped paw free before attempting to escape.'

Struggle: The gopher tried desperately to get away from the heron's clutches

Hard work: The heron still hasn't managed to secure his dinner

Gulp: The gopher eventually loses the battle however and is swallowed headfirst

Unfortunately for the gopher, the struggle was in vain, as a few seconds later he was scooped up head-first by the heron and swallowed whole.

'It can sometimes take hours of waiting before the heron actually finds anything at all,' says Daniel.

'But the action is all over very quickly. It doesn't take long for the heron to catch its prey once it's located it.

'Red-tailed hawks often like to sneak in and snatch the meal, so the heron has to work quickly.'

Daniel was around 30 feet from the action when he took the photographs in July of this year.

In addition to gophers, great blue herons are often spotted feasting on fish, frogs, snakes, rats and mice.
