Disturbing: Frederick Hengl, 69, was accused of killing, dismembering and cooking his wife, Anna Faris, at their California home. He died in jail while awaiting trial

A San Diego County man accused of killing his 73-year-old wife and then cooking her body parts has died of cancer while awaiting trial.The district attorney's office announced Friday that 69-year-old Frederick Hengl of Oceanside died of prostate cancer September 27 in the jail infirmary.

Hengl had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, willful cruelty 
to an elder and committing an unlawful act with human remains. He would have faced 
25 years to life in prison if convicted.Hengl was arrested last November after neighbours complained of a foul odour coming from his home in the 400 block of North Ditmar street.

Police found the head of his wife, Anna Faris, in a freezer and dismembered parts of her body cooking on a stove.

An 
officer who entered the home through a window said he saw on the stove 
three pans containing what later turned out to be the remains of the 
elderly woman.

Since no one was home at the time, he climbed through the window and observed what appeared to be meat 
cooking in several pans on the stove.

Grisly find: The dismembered body of Anna Faris, 73, was found in this Oceanside, California home last November

Unusual couple: Neighbours of the couple say they were extremely strange with the victim frequently seen with her pants down on the street while holding a knife and her husband seen cross dressing

Police found the 69-year-old man, 
described by neighbours as a notorious cross-dresser, at a nearby bar and
after interviewing him realised that Hengl was in the process of 
dismembering his wife's body, according to law enforcement officials.

Flaherty said officers opened the 
freezer to discover Faris' head severed at the top of the cervical 
vertebrae wrapped in a bag. A meat grinder was 'in use' nearby.

When they entered the bathroom, 
investigators found a work bench with a saw and boning knife, along with
other cutting instruments. They also came across a plastic bag filled 
with chunks of freshly cut bone. 

Prosecutors believe Hengl killed his 
wife on or between the dates of November 1 and 16. Neighbours told 
reporters that they had not seen the woman in about a month and had 
heard the sounds of a power saw from the couple’s two-bedroom bungalow 
style home about two weeks ago.

Several neighbours said Faris had been
behaving strangely since last spring, walking around with pants around 
her ankles, rarely bathing, carrying a butcher knife and telling 
strangers things like 'God will smite you.'

Gruesome sight: Entering the home police wearing masks discovered what remained of Mrs Hengl whom they said had been dead for at least one day

Tipped off: Next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, said he alerted authorities after a horrible smell poured from the home for a week and a half

‘My neighbour was just telling me 
she'd chase her down the street with a knife or she'd have her clothes 
off, pants down; you could tell she was a little bit out of it,’ neighbour Brett Lord told 10News.

'She'd
stand there, feed the birds, talk to folks walking by and her pants 
would fall. She didn't seem to notice, ever,' neighbour Jerry Parnell 
told 10News.

Her husband, however, also has gained notoriety around town for dressing up in women's clothing and wearing makeup.

In one instance a neighbour described
seeing him wearing a floor-length purple dress coupled with a long 
pearl necklace and earrings. In his hand he held a purse, reports UT San Diego.

‘He would cross-dress and you almost couldn't recognise the guy,’ Mr Parnell said.

Police
say there are no previous reports of domestic violence from the home 
though neighbours said they had made calls on Mrs Hengl in the past.

'About a week and a half ago, I noticed a pretty gross smell,' next-door neighbor Erick Chavez, 21, told NBC San Diego.

By that Friday morning, it had grown absolutely unbearable he said, prompting him to report it.

Entering the home police discovered what remained of Faris whom they said had been dead for at least one day.

Arrested
outside a downtown bar was her 69-year-old husband with police 
questioning neighbours on possible power tools or heavy machinery heard 
coming from the home as of late.

'I just thought somebody was working in their garage,' neighbour Nancy Wells, one of several who confirmed such sounds told CBS8.

In addition to the loud sounds, Mr Chavez said Hengl had shown a particular attachment to his trash cans as of late.

Odd behaviour: Mr Chavez said that in addition to hearing power tools as of late, the victim's husband Frederick Hengl was seen frequently carrying his trash cans to and from the house, the backyard seen

'The
man was taking his trash cans back and forth,' Mr Chavez told News10. 
'He’s been going around the block, up and around, taking pieces of her 
and putting them in the trash; going around the block? I don't know,' he
guessed.

Hengl denied killing his wife, who reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The couple had been married 34 years.

His preliminary hearing was postponed recently because of his need for medical treatment. It had been set for November 18.
