Sausage factory: Nick Clegg defended schools reforms plans against claims pupils were being over-tested

Nick Clegg has defended plans for tougher tests for young pupils, insisting he did not want primary schools to become 'exam sausage factories'.

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted it was right for children's academic ability to be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five.

Under the shake-up 11-year-olds face being ranked against their peers across the country to better prepare children for secondary school.

Unions warned of a 'bureaucratic nightmare' for teachers who would spend their time 'drilling' pupils to pass exams.

But Mr Clegg insisted: 'I don’t want my children to become part of some exam sausage factory - far from it.'

He said too many primary schools see pupils leave having already fallen behind their peers.

He added: 'All we’re 
saying is it can’t surely be right that under the current standards a 
school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who
leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at
secondary school.

'This is
not to try and either humiliate or celebrate, it’s to give teachers and
parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the 
school system. That’s all it is.

'I
saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this 
was a lurch back to a name-and-shame approach, it’s not at all.

'So
it’s higher standards, more money, and the aspiration, the hope is 
simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life.'

The changes would see primaries having to 
ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk 
triggering an Ofsted inspection.

Pupils
could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put 
in 10 per cent achievement ‘bands’, showing, for example, if they are in
the top 10 per cent.

The consultation document contains a reference to a ‘new benchmark’ to assess ‘progress that has been made by 11-year-olds’.

It
says the ‘baseline’ test ‘could be at age seven, as now, where teachers
assess pupils; or a simple check of a child’s ability in the early 
weeks of a child’s career at school’.

But teaching unions were critical of the plan, warning over-testing could be counter-productive.

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said: 'The Government has a fondness for testing young children in the belief that the tests create reliable measures of performance. They don't.

'And, by relying only on what can be measured, they risk missing what matters. There is far more to being 'secondary ready' than a score on an hour's test. A teacher's judgment, built up over four years, has much to contribute.'

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said: 'It is difficult to see how a 25 p increase in the primary floor standard between 2010 and 2016 could be realistically achieved without wide-scale teaching to the test and other inappropriate drilling techniques.'

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'School level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high stakes accountability, with no framework for support or provision of resources, the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers which could undermine high standards.'

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education. He warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late, adding: ‘Children may have lost a vital year of learning by then.’

Currently just 60 per cent of 11-year-olds in a school are required to reach Level 4 in maths and English Sats – the standard expected of their age group.

Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg yesterday could be judged to be under-performing. They could be taken over and turned into academies.

The current marking system will also be axed, although its replacement has not been confirmed.

The point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised. At present, achieving Level 4C – the bottom third of the Level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable. Yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good GCSEs, including maths and English.

Mr Clegg confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £900 to £1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards. Around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support.

Critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of  learning at school. After taking national tests at seven, they sit more Sats in maths, English and science when they are 11. Some take their first GCSEs the following year and complete them when they are 16, making four sets of exams in ten years.

AS-levels and A-levels bring the total to six in 12 years. Mr Clegg’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years.
