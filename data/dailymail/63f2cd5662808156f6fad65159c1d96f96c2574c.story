A British fox has broken a walking record after trekking 195 miles to find a new home.

Wildlife experts tracked the adult urban fox, called Fleet, using a GPS unit fitted to a collar around his neck, and were updated on his location every 30 minutes. 

During the course of three weeks, Fleet travelled from Brighton, across Sussex, into Kent and ended in Rye, before the signal was lost - meaning the creature could still be on his journey.

An adult fox, called Fleet, pictured, was fitted with a GPS tracker. He made the 195-mile journey over the course of three weeks in December. Researchers claim Fleet was hunting for a new home after his son, Fennec, forced him out. The GPS signal has been lost meaning the fox could still be going

A team from BBC Two’s Winterwatch fitted Fleet and FEnnec with night-vision cameras to catch them interacting.

Footage revealed Fennec’s body language, with his low posture and ears, indicated he was now the alpha male.

The
 scientists also noticed Fleet was not at his best and concluded he was 
suffering from lung worm.

As Fleet was was no longer the leader in his 
territory, experts believe he set off in search of a new home.

Dr
 Scott said: 'We don’t exactly know what happened but we think Fennec 
pushed him out and that pressure caused him to leave and try to find 
somewhere else.'

Scientist Dr Dawn Scott led the research project after she discovered a father and son pair living at the end of a garden in Hove, Sussex.

Fleet, who is believed to be three years old, was the dominant member until his son, dubbed Fennec, grew up and took control of the territory.

Fleet left his home on 9 December before moving to a cemetery in Brighton.

He then headed north out of the city and across the A27 towards Hassocks, Sussex.

Fleet began to make his way back south, but appeared to change his mind and headed east.

By Christmas, Fleet was tracked in Heathfield and then crossed the county’s border into Kent.

He journeyed back into Sussex over 
the the New Year and finished up in Rye having covered a distance of 195
 miles (315km) in just over three weeks - the previous record was just 
32 miles set in Wales.

Fearing Fleet had been shot or hit by a car, Dr Scott and her team ventured to his last known location.

'We went to area where we last had a signal for him to see if he had been run over or injured,' said Dr Scott.

A tiny bat recently became the first on record to fly from Britain to mainland Europe - despite being just the size of a thumb.

Researchers
 from Exeter University attached a miniature identity ring to the bat in
 October 2012 as part of research into bat migration habits.

The
 Nathusius' pipistrelle bat was last seen near Bristol in 2012 before 
being discovered 370 miles away in the Netherlands last month.

It
 is the first known British bat to have crossed the North Sea and the 
finding gives weight to claims that the bats may migrate in a similar 
way to birds.

'We didn’t find anything so we assume he is still going. We had been tracking him since the autumn and the GPS systems can fail.

'Last time we had him he appeared to be heading back along the coast towards Hastings so I don’t think he was finished.'

Dr
 Scott said the results confirm foxes will move out to colonise other 
areas when populations in urban areas reach their maximum densities.

'We know they travel to find new territory but we didn’t expect to see him go quite so far,' added Dr Scott.

'Especially as Fleet is an urban fox. He was born in Brighton and Hove and raised his young there.

'It’s incredible. The GPS tracker updated us on his location every 30 minutes. We kept thinking he was going to settle down but he kept going.

'The data from the study is really important to help us understand the behaviour of urban foxes and especially how they differ from the rural fox.'

Early results last autumn showed the pair venturing a couple of roads in each direction for food, not uncommon behaviour for urban foxes. Initially, dominant Fleet ate first, but over the weeks the foxes’ behaviour shifted.

A team from BBC Two's Winterwatch fitted Fleet, pictured, with a night-vision camera. Footage revealed that Fleet's son Fennec's body language indicated he was now the boss. The scientists believe that because he was no longer the leader in his territory, Fleet set off in search of a new home

Dr Scott added: 'We don’t exactly know what happened but we think Fennec pushed him out and that pressure caused him to leave and try to find somewhere else.

'In Brighton and Hove we estimate there are 20 foxes per square kilometre, so there can be a lot of competition.

'We know they move between urban and rural areas but what happened next we were not expecting.'
