This is the moment a drunk female driver loses control of her car and smashes into a house on a quiet residential street - all caught on the dash-cam of another shocked motorist.

Footage of the incident has gone viral and shows the 50-year-old woman speeding past another car, swerving to the right side of the road and careering into the patio and wall of a house in the Western Australian suburb of Mandurah, about 70km south of Perth.

Gobsmacked neighbours can be seen walking towards the car immediately after the incident, which occurred at about 3.15pm on Sunday, where amazingly no one was injured.

A police spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the female driver was charged with returning a positive blood alcohol reading in excess of 0.05, but would not confirm the level of the reading.

Peel Traffic Senior Sergeant Chris Hoath said the car was a 'write-off' and described the dashcam as a 'pretty neat device'.

'People don't understand the actions their car can have when it's going too quickly,' he told the Mandurah Coastal Times.

A man by the name of Wayne posted the footage on the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page yesterday, prompting more than 700 comments from outraged viewers.

Some joked about the lady's wreckless driving with Ashley Pope sarcastically comparing the driver to a super hero: 'Are you sure it wasn't Batman going back to his cave?'
