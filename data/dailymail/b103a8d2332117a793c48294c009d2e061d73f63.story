Under fire: Nick Gargan, suspended chief constable of Avon & Somerset police, has been hit with fresh claims of sexual impropriety

A chief constable suspended over sex harassment claims left a previous post at the British embassy in Paris under a cloud after it emerged he had been in a close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter.

Nick Gargan, head of Avon and Somerset Police, was last night facing difficult questions about his conduct when he worked on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana.

High-ranking diplomats are said to have been disappointed with the judgment of the then-married detective, who had a key role in the probe into the car crash which killed the Princess and Dodi Fayed.

His posting as police liaison officer at the embassy in 1998 came while he was on secondment to the National Criminal Intelligence Service.

The job meant he acted as intermediary between Scotland Yard and French detectives.

According to a number of sources, his close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter was hushed up, and after returning home Mr Gargan, now 47, continued his rise through the ranks.

Sue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said that she was unaware of Mr Gargan’s unhappy spell in Paris when she appointed him chief constable last year.

Until a month ago, when he was suspended over claims he sexually harassed at least four female officers and staff in Avon and Somerset, Mr Gargan was being tipped as a potential future Scotland Yard commissioner.

He vehemently denies the allegations. It was unclear last night whether the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating the alleged sexual harassment, will also probe the Paris claims.

Mr Gargan, then in his early 30s, formed a close relationship with the daughter of a senior British embassy colleague.

It is believed the woman, who was younger than Mr Gargan, was working at the embassy at the time. She could not be reached for comment last night.

It is understood that the British ambassador to France at the time, Sir Michael Jay, and other senior embassy officials were alerted to the relationship.

A source said: ‘Mr Gargan’s conduct while he was working at the British embassy in 1998 was wholly inappropriate.

‘It was certainly poor judgment, especially when you consider he was working on the Princess Diana investigation at the time.’

In a statement issued on behalf of Mr Gargan, the Chief Police Officers’ Staff Association said: ‘This is a historic, private and irrelevant matter. When Mr Gargan ended his secondment with the National Criminal Intelligence Service in 1998, it was entirely his own decision.’

A former colleague of Mr Gargan’s at the National Criminal Intelligence Service confirmed that he had left the embassy posting ‘under a cloud’ but would not elaborate.
