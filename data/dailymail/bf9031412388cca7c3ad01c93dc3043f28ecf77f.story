A canister of radioactive material stolen from the back of a van a month ago has been found in a shopping centre.

The Iridium 192 substance, which can increase the risk of cancer, cause burns, radiation sickness or even death, was discovered at The Point Retail Park in Rochdale yesterday afternoon.

A 100 metre cordon was put in place while the fire service recovered the potentially lethal material. 

Dangerous: Specialist investigators from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue examine work on removing the canister containing radioactive material from The Point Retail Park in Rochdale

Operation: Safety officers check the canister found dumped in a car park a month after it was stolen

Warning: A member of the public alerted police about a 'suspicious device' in a Rochdale car park

The canister was stolen from a Peugeot panel van in New Line, Bacup, Lancashire, last month and police warned people not to touch it.

The material was being transported from Scotland to the south of England by a courier who had stopped overnight.

Iridium 192 is often used in industrial radiography to locate flaws in metal components and in radiotherapy to kill cancers.

It emits harmful beta and gamma radiation and has the potential to cause damage to human cells if they are exposed to it for a prolonged period of time. 

Potentially lethal: The Iridium 192 substance can increase the risk of cancer, cause burns, radiation sickness or even death

Missing for a month: The yellow canister was stolen from a van in Bacup, Lancashire, in February

US nuclear experts have stated that iridium-192 is one of a handful of radioactive isotopes that would be suitable for a dirty bomb.

A statement from Greater Manchester Fire Service said: 'Firefighters and a Detection Identification and Monitoring (DIM) vehicle were sent to the address where they worked with police colleagues to recover the item.

'As a precautionary measure police put a 100-metre cordon in place and traffic diversions were put in place around the area.

'DIM vehicles are provided by Government to fire and rescue services across the country. They are operated by highly-trained officers and can detect, identify and monitor a large range of chemicals and substances.'

Plan of action: Specially trained fire fighters discuss how to safely remove the canister

Successful: Officers managed to safely retrieve the canister from the car park
