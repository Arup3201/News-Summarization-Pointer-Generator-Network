Sexually explicit messages revealing the ‘dirtiest secrets’ of pupils from a secondary school have been anonymously posted on Facebook.

A message was posted on the site urging 
pupils at the school, near Barnsley, to send in their 'secrets' to be 
added 'anonymously'.

Six hundred people have now clicked 'like' on the Facebook page called Penistone Grammar School’s Dirtiest Secrets, which contains crude messages about fellow pupils.

Creepy: The Facebook page encouraged pupils at Penistone Grammar School near Barnsley to send in messages revealing their 'dirtiest secrets'

The senior deputy head at the school, Geoff Baddock, said the local authority was working with Facebook to tackle the 'appalling' page.

'We’re taking action to warn our students that it is inappropriate and they are putting themselves at risk,' he said.

'We would always take appropriate action against pupils who are putting the school into disrepute and support students who are at risk.'

He added: 'One of the aspects of social media is youngsters post things without realising the consequences of it.'

The school's senior child protection officer and deputy head teacher, Peter Crook, posted on the page in an attempt to stop pupil’s using it.

His message read: 'Hello everyone. I heard about this page today and it’s interesting what you find on FB. It needs removing ASAP, if not, I will take as much time as needed to find out who set this up. Mr Crook.'

Similar Facebook pages have been created for other schools in the area, including Barnsley College, Kirk Balk Community College and Darton College.

A ‘Kirk Balk’s Dirtiest Secrets’ was also set up on Monday night and was spotted by staff the following morning after they were alerted by concerned pupils.

The school's head teacher Val Malcolm said : 'One of the biggest issues is the children hadn’t realised what danger they were putting themselves in by putting up a picture on an open website and linking it to the school and their names.

'The pupils didn’t know who had set the page up. Some pupils had also left their personal pages accessible through the public page.

'Luckily it was a pupil who set it up but it could have been somebody looking to groom. That is the danger when you don't know these people. It gives a wonderful opportunity for somebody to take advantage.'

Mrs Malcolm said the site included 'childish and unsavoury' comments but that a lot were positive, denouncing the derogatory posts.

Three pupils have been excluded from the school temporarily and an assembly was held on Thursday involving pupils who spoke about the importance of e-safety.

Mrs Malcolm said the page was reported to Facebook within minutes of being discovered by teachers, but claims the site could have acted more swiftly to remove it.

Mrs Malcolm said: 'Facebook should have been acting within minutes. This is about the health and safety of children who may be foolish and not have thought [about] what they were doing, but this is also about the health and safety of those children.'

A Facebook spokesman said the page had been removed as it broke the website’s terms.

'Whilst we don’t comment on individual cases content can be removed for a number of reasons such as bullying or harassing another user,' said the spokesman.
