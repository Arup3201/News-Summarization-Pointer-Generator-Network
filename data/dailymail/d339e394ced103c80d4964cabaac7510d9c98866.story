Paul Lambert is convinced Aston Villa’s new swagger and style will keep them away from a relegation battle this season.

That view comes in spite of a 1-0 defeat at Swansea City on Boxing Day that left Villa only five points clear of the bottom three. But Lambert believes he has seen enough in the four games since Villa adopted a possession-based game to be sure of survival.

There have been signs of encouragement, namely the draw with Manchester United and the fact they dominated possession away against a team like Swansea, but Villa have taken only four points since ditching their counter-attacking, direct style.

Paul Lambert is convinced Aston Villa’s new swagger and style will keep them away from a relegation battle

Lambert, whose side are at home to Sunderland on Sunday, said: ‘We have changed a lot over the last three weeks or so, and the players have grasped it really well. They are enjoying having a lot of the ball rather than chasing it.

‘We have found a way that really suits us. There will be so many twists and turns throughout the season but if we keep doing what we’ve been doing we will be fine.’

Lambert added: ‘History tells you in years gone by you have to earn the right to stay in the league regardless of how big your name is or how big the club is.

‘They say get 40 points and see what happens. We have got 20, last year it took us until January time to get 20 so that’s an improvement.’

Lambert issues instructions to forward Gabby Agbonlahor in the defeat to Swansea City

Aston Villa have at least, and at last, witnessed a return to form for Belgian striker Christian Benteke 

Yet there is no escaping a dreadful goals tally of 11 in 18 Premier League fixtures.

But Lambert insists there is not a confidence problem in his side, of whom only Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann have reached three goals this season.

‘The way we have played over the last few weeks is nothing to do with confidence. It’s been to do with good goalkeepers — we have had some poor finishing but it’s not a lack of confidence,’ he said.
