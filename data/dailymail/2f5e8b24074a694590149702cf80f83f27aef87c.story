Suspended: Revoe Primary School headteacher Catherine Woodall (pictured) has been suspended amid allegations over the care of pupils

A headmistress and five staff have been suspended after a pupil who went ‘berserk’ was locked in a room to calm down.

The teachers placed the nine-year-old boy in the ‘time out’ room after he terrorised staff and pupils at his primary school.

When he got home he told his parents and they called the police, complaining of false imprisonment.

Officers started an investigation and six staff members, including the headmistress Catherine Woodall, 61, have been suspended from their jobs and questioned by detectives.

The police inquiry will also examine claims other children had been ‘locked’ in the room when they misbehaved.

Last night parents and teachers reacted angrily to the suspensions.

‘This child went completely berserk and was likely to cause injury,’ said one member of staff.

'If he had injured anyone then the brickbats would have been out and questions would have been asked over why they had not put him in a secure room. It’s not good enough.

'Teachers are afforded no protection from violence and when they are assertive and use common sense this happens.’

The incident happened shortly before half-term at the 442-pupil Revoe Community Primary School in Blackpool.

The school has a special education unit which deals with children with behavioural problems from across the borough. It is understood the boy had been referred there from another school.

He is said to have been arguing with staff over a minor incident in the classroom before losing his temper. He was restrained in a corridor before being placed in the ‘time out’ room. Once in the soundproofed room, staff were able to monitor him through the window.

Selina Lapworth, 28, a mother of four, said parents wanted to know more about why the teachers had been suspended.

‘Every school has naughty children and there are a few here but the teachers always seem to deal with it quite well,’ she said.

Incident: Six staff including the head at Revoe Primary School in Blackpool have been suspended after a boy, nine, was disciplined

‘It seems pretty heavy handed that she (the head) has been suspended and we’d like to know the reasons.’

The headmistress is understood to have
 been off sick on the day of the incident but was questioned as she has 
overall responsibility for decisions taken in the school.

Under education guidelines pupils with challenging behaviour should not be left locked up alone and unsupervised in such rooms.

Last night, at her home near Chorley, 
Mrs Woodall said: ‘I have been suspended. I have received a telephone 
call from the education authority threatening me that if I speak to 
anyone I will be disciplined, which is a bit ironic. So I am not willing
 to speak to anyone.’

Two heads from other primary schools 
in the town have been drafted in to manage Revoe, which was recently 
given a glowing Ofsted report.

Parent Emma Chadwick, 28, said it was 
time for an inquiry into the disciplinary methods of the school. She 
claimed her seven-year-old son was put in the ‘cupboard room’ for 
misbehaving last year. ‘It is disgusting that children can be treated in
 this way when they are at school,’ she said.

A police spokesman said: ‘This 
allegation, like any allegation involving the well-being of young 
people, is being taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly 
investigated.’
