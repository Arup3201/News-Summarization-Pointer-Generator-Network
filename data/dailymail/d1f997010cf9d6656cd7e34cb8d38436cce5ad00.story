David plays Dr. Stagg in a new theatre production of Pressure

All British actors these days tell you they'd really like to be in a Scandi drama like Borgen or The Bridge. Would any be as qualified as David Haig, though?

We may think of the star of Four Weddings And A Funeral – he was memorable as bumbling bridegroom Bernard – as quintessentially English (he blames the moustache he sported for most of his career), but one of the more curious discoveries about him is he speaks fluent Danish. He lived in Denmark in his 20s while he was (yes, really) training as a plumber.

'It wasn't an ordinary plumber, so I wouldn't be much good at fitting a toilet,' he says, apologetically, before the conversation turns to tricky  U-bends. 'It was more specialised – I laid pipes underground. I still have the certificate.' He also still has the language skills, crucially.

'I picked it up very quickly because in the part of Jutland I was in no one spoke English, and it's stayed with me.'

What he finds hilarious now is that when he was living in Denmark, all anyone wanted to talk to him about was how good British actors were.

'At that time, they were in awe of British drama. It was the time of The Forsyte Saga – those big productions British TV did really well before the low-budget competitiveness crept in.'

Heady days, and long gone. Now, he says, 'there's been a complete turnaround' and the entire British TV industry is looking to Scandinavia with lustful eyes. He's even tried to get himself cast in a Scandi drama.

You'd imagine they would have jumped at the chance given his CV. As well as the high-profile roles that get him recognised in Sainsbury's, he also has an Olivier Award for his theatre work including King Lear and Jim Hacker (in the stage production of Yes, Prime Minister).

Ironically, it was his fluency in Danish that ruled him out of his Scandi dream role. 'I wrote to a producer saying I couldn't think of anything nicer than playing a part in Danish. He wrote back saying, "We don't want Brits who come over and speak Danish. We want them to come and speak English." I didn't want to speak English. So that was that.'

Denmark's loss was our gain. His latest role, in the play Pressure, has taken him to the stage in Edinburgh, and is now moving to Chichester.

David's most famous role was as Bernard in Four Weddings and a Funeral, pictured here with Sophie Thompson who played Lydia

The production tells the true story of Dr James Stagg, a Scottish meteorologist summoned to Allied Headquarters in Portsmouth to advise General Eisenhower on weather conditions in the build-up to what became known as the D-Day landings.

As well as playing the lead role, Haig wrote the play. No, er, pressure then. He laughs. 'Well, I didn't write it thinking that I'd take the part. I actually approached some actors I had in mind, but they couldn't do it – so I was persuaded to do it myself. In a way it was fortuitous. I tried to channel all the angst I was feeling from writing the thing into the part. It's all about a man - a mere weatherman - feeling that the weight of the world is on him. He has to make a prediction that could win or lose the Second World War.'

It's an extraordinarily tense production, and he's been getting rave reviews in the part. His fans will wonder where the distinctive moustache has gone, though. He says he shaved it off to do The Madness Of George III on stage in 2011 and felt 'liberated'.

Unsung hero: David Haig as D-Day weather forecaster James Stagg

'My moustache tried to pigeonhole me for years,' he admits. 'I honestly can't remember why I had it in the first place, possibly for a part – I was always seen as an upper-middle-class military chap. But I'm free of it now and I must say I don't miss it. The real Dr Stagg had a moustache, so the fact that I didn't grow mine back for it says it all.'

At 58, he does seem to be at the peak of his career, trying to get that balance between writing and acting – and between jobs that offer creative opportunity and those that pay the bills. He's an open and thoughtful interviewee but a complicated man.

He says he's 'an upbeat person with a melancholy streak' and the upbeat side of him only wins through because of his wife. 'She's everything I'm not,' he says of Julia, a past MasterChef finalist who was an actress and still dabbles (she took her one-woman comedy show about the history of the potato to Edinburgh last year).

'She's an extremely calm person, whereas I'm not. I throw my energy into everything, can't make decisions.'

He half-jokes that the reason he still works so prodigiously is that they have five children. 'There was a terrifying time when I had four at private school at the same time,' he says. Now, ranging in age from 29 to 14, only two are 'officially' still at home, but the others – at drama school or university – keep popping in and out.

It all seems idyllic – the family has lived in the same house in south London for nearly 30 years – but the couple have known great tragedy. David's first 'life-changing' loss happened when he was 26. His younger sister Karen died from a brain haemorrhage in 1982, aged just 22, and his world turned upside down.

'It was the shock of it,' he says. 'She was such an effervescent person, a very energised person.' The effect on his life was incalculable. 'Nothing ever surprised me again. Ever since, I've never felt shock from people dying early. It doesn't mean I don't feel it greatly – I do – but it never shocks. I think my sister's death matured me in a way I wasn't expecting.'

In 1996, there was unthinkable pain when he and Julia lost a daughter, Grace, at birth. Ever since they have worked for SANDS, the stillbirth and neonatal charity. Julia has also recently qualified as a child counsellor; he has manned the phones at his local Samaritans office.

He says he doesn't want to sound trite, 'But there is something about grabbing your experiences in life and turning them into something positive. We've tried to do that. I know it isn't always possible, some things are too crippling, but what is the alternative? I do believe life is about gaining wisdom of some sort.'

Has all this loss shaped his own thoughts on growing older? 'I used to be very obsessed by the thought of the end,' he admits. 'Probably a few inches below the surface I still am, but I don't show it the way I used to. I try to be as zen as possible. It's the old cliché about seizing life while you can, isn't it? I've sort of attacked everything.'

In professional terms, there is little he hasn't achieved ('although I haven't written a film yet'). And at home he's as close to 'zen' as he's likely to get.

'I'll tell you what's lovely,' he says. 'When all the children are home and we're round the table and you can talk to them as fellow adults and friends. That's one of the nicest things in the world.'

Pressure runs at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, until 28 June. Tickets, www.cft.org.uk.
