Tottenham are making one final push to finally land Swansea defender Ben Davies.

The club's failure to strike a deal with Swansea has left Tottenham officials considering alternatives for their problematic left back berth.

But new Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is determined to have Davies as his first-choice left back next season and the club are ramping up their attempts to sign the player.

In demand: Both Tottenham and Liverpool want to sign Swansea left back Ben Davies

Exciting prospect: Ben Davies has already played 84 times for Swansea despite only turning 21 in April

Spurs' move for Davies has been complicated by Liverpool's interest in the defender.

And Tottenham are now trying to rush through a move as they look to beat the Anfield club to Davies.

Swansea want £12million, and it is understood Spurs will improve upon their original £8million offer.

Tottenham thought they had made a breakthrough in discussions towards the end of last month, after tabling an offer for the full back that they believed was enough to snare Davies.

However, Swans chairman Huw Jenkins pulled the plug on the deal at the last minute leaving Tottenham frustrated.
