The Brazilian government has spent £4.2 million ($7.2 million) on robots to prepare the country ahead of the Pope's visit next year and the Rio Olympics in 2016.

The iRobot 510 PackBots, built by Massachusetts-based robotics firm iRobot Defense and Security, have previously served in the war in Iraq and are described as 'multi-mission, battle-tested' robots. 

They are set to be used during the construction of Olympic stadiums to help clear routes and hunt for explosives.

The Brazilian government have spent $7.2 million (£4.2 million) on iRobot 501 PackBots to get the country ready for the Pope's visit next year, and for the Rio Olympics in 2016. The robots can clear routes, find hazardous material and carry out other reconnaisance missions across the country

The iRobot 510 travels at up to 5.8 miles per hour and can be fitted with sensors that detect hazardous materials. A thermal camera can also be fitted to the PackBot's chassis

After winning the government contracts, Frank Wilson, senior vice president and general manager of iRobot’s Defense and Security said:

'iRobot continues its international expansion, and Brazil represents an important market for the company’s unmanned ground vehicles.

'iRobot is excited to be providing the company’s state-of-the-art robotic technologies to Brazil as the country prepares for several high profile international events, including the 2014 FIFA World Cup.'

The £4.2 million contract also includes robot spares and associated equipment.

The company has delivered more than 5,000 robots to military and civil missions worldwide.

Its mobile robots have performed multiple missions for troops and public safety officers.

They can go into areas that are 
considered a risk to human life, including areas containing hazardous 
materials, as well as bring back data.

The robots bought by the Brazilian government are the iRobot 510 PackBot models and they have been hired until December 2013.

They are reminiscent of the Omni Consumer Products (OCP) robots from the 1987 film Robocop in the kind of missions they carry out.

The PackBots are battery powered and can climb stairs and slopes of up to a 60-degree angle.

They can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour, and continue to be fully operation in water up to three-feet deep. 

PackBots are waterproof and can work in all weather conditions.

iRobots including the 310 and the 510 PackBots have been sent to war zones, including Iraq, to help soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions. The robots can go into dangerous situations and collect data for troops. The iRobot can be fitted with GPS mapping technology, which means it can retrace its steps if communications are disrupted

iRobots can be used to clear routes and get rid of debris including gun shells and unexploded bombs. It uses sensors and built-in cameras to find the objects and can be fitted with small arms that can collect the items and move them out of the way

Depending on the mission, PackBots can be fitted with various payloads.

they can be fitted with sensors and tools including small arms to help carry and move items, explosive detection kits, a thermal camera, and cable cutters.

If the PackBot is flipped over, it can also automatically right itself.

If communication to the PackBot is cut off, the robot will retrace its steps to find its mission team. 

The UAP models of the PackBot are semi-autonomous, which means they can travel and make decisions by themselves.

It can automatically avoid bumps, debris and other obstacles and it uses GPS mapping to navigate around a mission area.

The 510 PackBots can climb up and down stairs and have a built-in inclinometer to help it navigate up slopes. It can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour up a slope of 60 degrees
