Air France has been told to pay a passenger 10,000 euros after ordering the pro-Palestinian activist off a flight to Tel Aviv because she was not Jewish.

The airline was also ordered to pay Horia Ankour 3,000 euros in damages together with her legal fees after refusing to take her to Israel from France last April.

The 30-year-old nursing student had wanted to attend the 'Welcome to Palestine' campaign which involved hundreds of supporters from across the globe trying to enter Israel in a bid to travel to the Palestinian territories.

After boarding the plane in the southeastern French city of Nice an Air France staff member asked whether she had an Israeli passport, 9 News reports.

When she said she did not the Air France employee asked whether she was Jewish. She was taken off the aircraft when she replied that she was not.

Some of Europe's biggest airlines cancelled around 300 tickets ahead of the Welcome to Palestine event under pressure from Israel.

Air France said that as she was on a list of undesirables supplied by Israel, she would not have been allowed into the country anyway.

Her legal case was backed by French prosecutors who said it was a clear case of discrimination, according to 9 News.
