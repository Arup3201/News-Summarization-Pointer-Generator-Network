A call by the Children’s Commissioner for England for a total ban on smacking children has angered family campaigners.

Maggie Atkinson said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to ‘physical abuse’, and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters.

She sparked controversy by calling for a total ban which would see parents facing criminal action for corporal punishment.

Maggie Atkinson said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to 'physical abuse', and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters

However, family campaigners claimed there were times when parents needed to smack young children because they were blatantly ignoring other punishments or warnings.

Under current laws, it is illegal for a parent to smack a child if it leaves a bruise, but a lighter smack or ‘reasonable chastisement’ are allowed.

Dr Atkinson said: ‘Personally, having been a teacher, and never having had an issue where I’d need to use physical punishment, I believe we should move to ban it. 

‘In law you are forbidden from striking another adult, and from physically chastising your pets, but somehow there is a loophole around the fact that you can physically chastise your child.’

Dr Atkinson, who has two adult step-children, said that despite her strong feelings about the issue, her office was not planning to fight for a ban next year.

Phillip Noyes, of the NSPCC, said: ‘It’s right that we continue to push to get children equal protection in law.

'It would not be intended to criminalise good parents but to put into law what more and more parents are already moving towards – finding better ways than smacking to discipline their children.’ 

But Margaret Morrissey, of family group Parents Outloud, branded Dr Atkinson’s comments as ‘extremely irresponsible’.

She said: ‘Of course nobody should thrash or beat or abuse a child but there are times when you have to show a child that the parameters have been passed.

‘Children have to realise there’s a limit beyond which you can go.’ 

A Government spokesman said: ‘Our policy on smacking is clear. We do not condone violence towards children. However, we do not wish to criminalise parents for issuing a mild smack.’
