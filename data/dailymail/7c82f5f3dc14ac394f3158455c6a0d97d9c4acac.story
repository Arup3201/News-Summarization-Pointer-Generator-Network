It may be the first day of spring, but don't pack away those snow shovels just yet.

Up to 36 million people are under some sort of winter weather advisory, while forecasters have warned Winter Storm Ultima will dump six inches of snow on the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Friday.

And a few locations, particularly in the higher elevations, could see even more of the white stuff, meteorologist Bruce Terry of the National Weather Service warned.

South central Pennsylvania will be in the bulls-eye of the storm and receive up to 10 inches of snow, he said on Thursday. Western Maryland could get slammed with up to 8 inches.

New England will be on the lower end of the snow totals but even Boston, which has seen a record 108.6 inches of snow, could get an inch or two more. 

The snow in New England - including Boston - will start Friday and possibly stretch through Saturday night. 

Terry said that of all the cities, New York will get hit the hardest. The Big Apple is expected to get four to six inches of wet snow.

'New York City and most places in the Northeast will see the coldest air since March 7 return to the region,' Accuweather's Evan Duffey said. 

Cold air from another arctic blast is chilling moisture along the Virginia coast.

That system will move north and east Friday, dropping snow and bringing rain, while temperatures will dip into the low- to mid-30s.

'It's just cold enough to snow,' Terry said.

By Saturday, it will be in the 40s in the Northeast and in the 50s in the mid-Atlantic, he said.

Temperatures are expected to rise further on Monday and Tuesday, raising concerns about flooding in the areas that still have snow pack on the ground.

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration says eastern New England and western New York will be hardest hit by this melt - with an estimated five inches of water locked in snowpack in eastern New England.

Melting is also an issue for the regions rivers which can become blocked with ice.

Meteorologist Ryan Maue, of Weather Bell Analytics, warned that spring might take a while to fully win out. Temperatures will remain unseasonable cool into next week and another system with snow potential is headed for the Midwest, he said.

'It's more of a nuisance at this point, especially after this winter,' Maue said.

The ongoing wintry mix comes as Boston has set an all-time snowfall record. 

A storm this past weekend dropped 2.9 inches of snow at Logan International Airport, pushing the seasonal accumulation to 108.6 inches and surpassing the previous record of 107.6 set in 1995-96.

The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30. Records go back to 1872.

'I wished I would have blocked the numbers from friends back in Southern California texting me screenshots of the 80-plus degree weather there,' said Matt Guerrieri who just moved to Boston.

But the snow that has already fallen didn't bury Bostonians' collective sense of humor.

Mayor Marty Walsh tweeted that the Boston yeti - a local who's been dressing up as the abominable snowman and walking around the city drawing laughs - would be taking over as interim mayor.

Bruce Mendelsohn, a Cambridge public relations executive, quipped, 'Boston has a rich tradition of leading the nation in the pursuit of liberty, freedom, sports titles and snowplows.'

But in what will come as a shock to many after the onslaught of snow, federal records show that this winter and has actually been the warmest since records began.

At nearly 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit above 20th century average, last month was the second warmest February on record globally, slightly behind 1998.

But the combined January and February temperature beat the old record for the first two months set in 2002. December through February broke the meteorological winter record set in 2007.
