Most typical five-month-old babies can't crawl, let alone drive, but an experimental buggy has given some lucky children the chance to steer their own robot.

Designed by researchers at Ithaca College in New York to assist babies with disabilities, the WeeBot encourages children to move around independently using the pint sized scooter.

Built from a motorised base, a booster seat and a Nintendo Wii balance board, the WeeBot was developed to stimulate the cognitive functions of children suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy or Down syndrome.

Intended for children who are unable 
to crawl because they suffer from a mental impairment, the WeeBot is 
supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their 
development.

'In 
typically developing infants, the initiation of independent locomotion 
heralds concomitant development in aspects of communicative, emotional, 
perceptual, cognitive and social behaviour,' states a study produced by 
the research team at Ithaca College.

'Typically
developing children whose mobility has been restricted for even 
relatively short periods of time have been found to demonstrate 
apathetic behaviour and depressed motivation,' states the study.

At
the moment though, the robots encourage children with disabilities to 
move around independently, at exactly the same time that other 
five-month-old infants have learned to crawl.

However, one of the scientists in the research team which created the WeeBot has said that the device is in fact only a developmental aid for children and parents should always encourage their child to walk.

'For children who are typically developing we would encourage parents to support their child's 'natural' development, because at each stage of motor development, children develop strength and skills that help them master the next developmental steps,' said Carole Dennis Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy at Ithaca College

'That said, we don't think that robot experience in and of itself would stunt development (unless children weren't provided sufficient experiences for typical movement development). 

'My colleagues (Sharon Stansfield and Hélène Larin) and I think that it might actually increase the motivation of children to move.

It is movement which some childhood specialists believes encourages mental development, as children seek out new environments for their brain to make sense of.

'We think that babies with disabilities are missing an opportunity for learning that typically developing babies have,' said Carole Dennis to Yahoo.

Previously, researchers had focused on providing babies with joysticks, however, the WeeBot relies on the baby simply leaning in the direction that it wants to travel.

'What I think is exciting is that we're pushing the age envelope much and much younger,' said Maria Jones, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Oklahoma who was not part of the WeeBot research.

The research team at Ithaca were driven on by findings of past research which indicate that developing children undergo dramatic mental changes when they start to move by themselves.

However, some children with disabilities do not begin to learn to explore their environment until they are three-years-old.

The WeeBot built by Ithaca College to enable disabled children to experience movement and learning and therefore increase their development

'We know the brain is aching for exploration,' said Cole Galloway, a physical therapist at the Univeristy of Delaware who is an expert in robot maneuverability devices for infants.

'It we treated a typically developing kid the way we treat these kids, it would be as it we put these kids in a closet of cage until they can take adult commands,' said Galloway.

To create the WeeBot, Dennis teamed up with physical therapist Héléne Larin and computer programmer Sharon Stansfield.

The Wii board part registers shifts in weight to the left  or right or forwards or backwards depending on how the child leans.

The Ithaca team added sonar-style instruments to the front and back of the WeeBot to halt the children running into obstacles.

The team discovered after a little training, 90 percent of able bodied infants could successfully control the device.

And then children with disabilities were given trial runs to see they would react.

One, a seven-month-old boy with Down syndrome only used the WeeBot satisfactorily nine-percent of the time, while a 15-month old with cerebral palsy became 85-percent proficient in use of the device.

The Segway was the first self-balancing electric powered transportation machine and was introduced in 2002

Researchers believe that the WeeBot needs more trialing before they can think about a cost-effective manufacture, especially in its safety features.

However, the researchers believe that the WeeBot genuinely aids in the development of mentally disabled children and will push to see them put into production.

'Some parents of typically-developing infants that we have worked with have mentioned that their children seem to be a bit frustrated when they aren't in the WeeBot, because they can't move,' said Carole Dennis.

'So the realization that there is a great world out there to explore might increase children's desire to get moving!'
