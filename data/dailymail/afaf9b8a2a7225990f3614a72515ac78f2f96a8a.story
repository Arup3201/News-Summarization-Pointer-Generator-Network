Juan Mata has apologised for Manchester United's abysmal performance at Leicester City, saying he shared the pain of the fans after they twice surrendered a two-goal lead.

United led 2-0 and 3-1 at the King Power Stadium before capitulating to lose 5-3 in a performance the Spaniard described as 'disappointing.'

Mata vowed to the fans that United would bounce back in their next two home fixtures against West Ham and Everton.

Juan Mata, who was a late substitute for Manchester United in their 5-3 defeat at Leicester, has apologised for their poor performance on his latest blog post

Mata was on the bench until the 76th minute at the King Power Stadium, when he came on for Angel di Maria

Writing on his blog, Mata, who came on for Angel di Maria 14 minutes from time, said: 'After a whole week waiting for the match I could not imagine a Sunday like this.

'The way back from Leicester to Manchester on the bus seemed really long.

'I kept thinking about how we lost a game that was under control, but the thing is we were ahead, they equalised and when we tried to get advantage again we lost.

'It's really tough to score three goals away and come back home with no points.

'On our way back to Manchester I was thinking about what had happened and felt so disappointed as all those that came with us to the stadium.

'Honestly, I feel very sorry that the weekend ended up for our fans in such a sad way.'

Mata's afternoon in Leicester was in stark contrast to his performance in last weekend's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers, in which he scored the fourth goal

The result exposed weaknesses in United's defence that Van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs must address

Saturday - West Ham (H)

October 5 - Everton (H)

October 20 - West Brom (A)

October 26 - Chelsea (H)

November 2 - Manchester City (A)

November 8 - Crystal Palace (H)

United were twice in a two-goal lead at Leicester but surrendered them both and had young defender Tyler Blackett sent off.

Mata, who was left helpless in attack as Leicester wrapped up the win, said United's performances would improve.

He wrote: 'There is time during the week to analyse what happened and learn from our mistakes so as not to make them again.

'Now we play two consecutive games in Old Trafford that we want to win for our fans. We will put our best efforts to it, you can be sure of that.

'I hope to be in a better mood next Sunday to tell you about the game and many other things, to try to put a smile in our face on Monday.

'Thank you for being there in the good and the bad times and never giving up. It is important to feel your support.' 

United were cruising to victory when Ander Herrera put them 3-1 up in the 57th minute

Jamie Vardy inspired Leicester's comeback and scored the goal that put them 4-3 up

United's miserable afternoon was compounded when Tyler Blackett was sent off for this foul on Vardy
