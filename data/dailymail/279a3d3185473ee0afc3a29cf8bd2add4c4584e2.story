A team of Greenpeace campaigners were arrested at the Champions League final in Lisbon before they were able to unfurl a banner in protest of Gazprom.

Ten people lived inside a concrete tube at the Estadio da Luz for three days, before being stopped on the roof, not being able to fix their message.

The SaveTheArctic team have been spotted at other European occasions this season, including a match between Basel and Schalke, who are sponsored by Gazprom, and a Real Madrid press conference.

Protest: Greenpeache campaigners wanted to unfurl an anti-Gazprom banner at the Estadio da Luz

Disruption: Protesters from Greenpeace hung a banner at the Real Madrid press conference

Fixed: A Copenhagen official puts the banner out of sight while Pepe and Carlo Ancelotti took questions

Hilarity: The Real Madrid find amusement as the official struggles to get it above the sponsor hoardings

'We love football at Greenpeace. We were excited about the Champions League Final. And we couldn't let Gazprom - and its bosses, watching from the VIP seats below - hide behind the game we love while it's threatening the future of the planet.

'We went to the stadium to ask UEFA to give Gazprom the red card. That message still stands.'

They had planned to fix a 50 meters squared banner – reading 'STOP GAZPROM – SAVE THE ARCTIC' – on the roof before the game.

Vladimir Putin’s state-owned oil giant is the ‘Official Partner’ of the competition in a deal said to be worth £130million over three years.

Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said: 'We were trying to fix a banner because we knew Gazprom’s bosses would be in the stadium, looking up. Gazprom has paid millions to splash its logo across the biggest and best sporting event in the world.

'They want to persuade us they’re a normal company, but they’re not. Their dangerous Arctic drilling programme threatens a beautiful region and the global climate. That’s what our protest was about. UEFA should ditch Gazprom.'

The final between Real and Atletico Madrid instead proceeded with it's opening ceremony.

Opener: Diego Godin scored first for Atletico Madrid against rivals Real
