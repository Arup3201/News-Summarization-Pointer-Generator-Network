Larry Flynt has offered Republican senate candidate Richard Mourdock $1million to prove he has had 'conversations with God.'

The bizarre challenge follows Mr Mourdock's comment during a debate last week that even when babies are conceived during 'that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.'

Mr Flynt - who is best known as the publisher of Hustler and other adult entertainment magazines - said in an open letter that among the evidence he would accept would be a 'verifiable transcript of [Mr Mourdock's] personal conversations with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God.'

Offer: The letter - which was posted by Mr Flynt on his website - asks Mr Mourdock to 'be kind enough to verify [his] claim for a wondering nation'

The letter, which was posted on Mr Flynt's website and published in a local newspaper - where he identifies himself as a free speech activist - gave
Mr Mourdock a deadline of 8pm on November 5 to respond.

'Please be kind enough to verify your 
claim for a wondering nation,' the letter requests

'I will accept for purposes 
of this reward any verifiable transcript of your personal conversations 
with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God, or messages 
addressed to you from God transmitted by any third party, including the 
Republican National Committee or the Romney/Ryan campaign.

'I assume that you would not have made 
this statement unless you had been authorised by God.

'No one who 
believes in God would ever use the Almightyâ€™s name in vain. That would 
be blasphemy,' Mr Flynt wrote.

'I am eager to receive your proof and pay my
$1 million reward to you.'

Controversial: The reward is similar to past efforts by the left-leaning businessman to embarrass public figures he disagrees with

Earlier this year Mr Flynt offered $1 million to anyone with proof of 'an illicit sexual liaison' involving former Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry.

During an interview with RTV6 news yesterday evening, Mr Flynt said he could not believe 'that someone who makes such a stupid, asinine remark still remains in the race for the U.S. Senate.'

'It just boggles my mind. I can't imagine that Indiana would elect this man,' he said.

Mr Mourdock said last week that he stood by his comment but regretted that his remark had been misconstrued, RTV6 reports.

Mr Mourdock will face Democrat Representative Joe Donnelly and Libertarian Andrew Horning in the November 6, general election.
