For years, modelling  has been one of the few industries where women's pay has far exceeded that of men.

But the new breed of male models could be about to change that. 

Thanks to social media sites like Twitter and Instagram, men who get paid to pose for a living are racking up tens of thousands of followers.

These lusting fans are the key to big modelling campaigns in this tech-savvy age. 

Female models like Cara Delevingne and Miranda Kerr cottoned on early in the game and have long been using their looks as a marketing tool, making them  doubly attractive to big advertisers. 

When a model with millions of followers posts an advert they have posed for onto their Instagram or Facebook page, the product is beamed onto huge numbers of phones and computers across the world, with no extra expense to the company.

So the model with more followers is of more use to the advertisers and can charge a higher fee for their work. 

What does this mean for us? More and more photos of male models - which is surely only a good thing.
