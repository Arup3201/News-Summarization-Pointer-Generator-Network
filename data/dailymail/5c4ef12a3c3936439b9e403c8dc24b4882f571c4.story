Thai authorities have been mocked for a social media campaign urging teenagers to refrain from having sex on Valentine's Day.

Ahead of February 14, the Culture Ministry's Moral Promotion Center issued their usual warning to young people to avoid sex outside marriage. 

But this year, the ministry's campaign was bigger after a recent survey showed 83% of young people said they planned to have sex on Valentine’s Day. 

So they also launched a Twitter hashtag in the heavily publicized campaign to urge youngsters to return to their respective homes after enjoying a dinner date.

Young people were asked to support the campaign called 'Just a Meal for Valentine's Day' by tweeting #DinnerOnly in Thai - but instead, the request attracted mockery.

This year's campaign came amid a morality overhaul initiated by Thailand's military government, which took power from an elected administration following a coup last May.

The Ministry of Culture said a recent survey it conducted found 83% of Thai teenagers planned to have sex on Valentine's Day, according to local media reports. 

Earlier this week, police asked parents and teachers to inform children of the 'dangers' of Valentine's Day and to avoid 'risky behavior'.

Police also warned nightclubs across the country not to admit underage customers. 

Major General Patipat Suban Na Ayuuthaya said that all police units would be on alert until Sunday to 'increase vigilance in risky areas' such as nightclubs.

He urged entertainment venues to call police hotlines to reports cases of youths trying to enter.

One all-girl's school in Bangkok took the extra step of holding a Valentine's Day self-defense class earlier this week. 

Thai media showed policewomen on stage in the auditorium of the Sainampeung School flipping a man before an assembly of hundreds of students.

Authorities annually warn youths to avoid 'inappropriate activities' on Valentine's Day, which is widely celebrated in Thailand. 

Narathip Pumsap, the Moral Promotion Center's director, said: 'Parents and teachers should create correct understanding about Valentine's Day with children.

She added that instead of engaging in intimacy, young people should 'show love to their family, society, themselves and the country,' the Khaosod newspaper reported. 

Despite its reputation as a freewheeling destination for sex tourism, Thailand's socially conservative authorities are on a constant mission to uphold the country's traditional Buddhist values. 

Hollywood movies are censored with sex scenes and cigarette smoking pixellated out, and Thai soap operas are not allowed to show alcohol consumption.
