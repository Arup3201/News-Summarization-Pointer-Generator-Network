A Connecticut man who posed nude for Playgirl 18 years ago, is suing his recent employer for harassment after co-workers taunted him about having posed for the magazine.

Daniel Sawka's former co-workers yelled 'Timber!' around the office after they found pictures online from a 1992 Playgirl photo shoot featuring him posing as naked lumberjack.

Sawka filed a lawsuit in Federal Court claiming his co-workers endlessly taunted him in the workplace and used company computers to search for the Playgirl photos.

Daniel Sawka ( seen here in a current headshot), a former Playgirl model, is suing his employer because co-workers taunted him in the office once they discovered pictures of him posing as a nude lumberjack

Sawka was hired to work for ADP Inc., a payroll company, as a district sales manager in 2009.

In his suit Sawka claims the harassment started a month after he was hired, when his co-workers found the nude photos online by Googling his name.

'Following the discovery of the nude pictures, employees in the office 
engaged in a pattern and practice of jokes, sexually charged comments 
and ridicule concerning the plaintiff and the pictures,' states the suit, as cited by Courthouse News Service.

The Playgirl shoot shows Sawka posing suggestively with an axe, as well as has several pictures featuring his fully nude form.

The suit goes on to say that despite Sawka's repeated requests for his co-workers to stop making comments and jokes about the photo shoot, their ridicule continued.

'Jokes
and comments were made by the defendant's employees including but not 
limited to comments about plaintiff's body parts, including his 
genitals, and a comment about what homosexual men viewing the photos and
what they would be doing while viewing the photos,' the complaint states.

Sawka worked at ADP Inc. until March 2011, at which time he claims he was 'constructively discharged.'

Sawka posed for Playgirl as a nude lumberjack in 1992. Once his co-workers found the old pictures online they tormented him around the office

He is seeking back pay, front pay, bonuses, personal days, lost pension and 
retirement benefits, costs, and damages for 
emotional distress for the lawsuit.

Though Sawka no longer models nude, he is still a model. Sawka is currently represented by Ramona's Model and Talent, LLC.
