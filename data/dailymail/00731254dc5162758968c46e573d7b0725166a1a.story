Undeterred: Aerosol attack victim Callum Watkins, 15, laid a wreath for Remembrance Sunday

This is the 15-year-old poppy seller who refused to quit after being attacked with a makeshift flamethrower.

Callum Watkins laid a wreath for Remembrance Sunday in his full cadet's uniform just days after he was attacked at a bus stop in Manchester city centre.

The schoolboy was left with minor burns after a stranger lit an aerosol spray and blasted it towards his face last week.

Undeterred, he vowed to carry on selling poppies for the Royal British Legion - and said he wants to train as an army paramedic.

Callum laid his wreath with friends from the Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment during yesterday's Remembrance Sunday parade in Manchester.

He said afterwards: 'Most of my mates were surprised that I still carried on selling the poppies. They've all been very good to me, they've helped pull me through it all.'

The teenager was waiting for a bus home at 6pm on November 1 when he was attacked outside Manchester Art Gallery, less than 100 yards from the city's cenotaph.

He had spent the day selling poppies and was wearing his camouflage uniform. 

Callum suffered minor burns to his face and singed hairs on his face and right forearm.

His mother Kirsty Sloan said last week he was 'very upset' by the incident and confirmed he was now recovering at home.

'His face is burned and he is not very well,' she said. 'We just want whoever did this caught so that Callum can put it behind him.' 

At yesterday's service she said the family had been inundated with well-wishers nationwide and an invitation for Callum to meet RAF officials.

His family has even been invited to afternoon tea with the Lord Mayor of Manchester Susan Cooley.

Parade: The teenager joined friends from the Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment for the Manchester service

The tribute by Callum was one of thousands by veterans and their families in Manchester city centre yesterday.

A service was led by Bishop of Manchester David Walker and faith leaders on the 100th anniversary of the First World War, which killed 23,792 soldiers from Greater Manchester.

Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, said: 'The centenary certainly isn't necessarily something to celebrate, but it is something that we should remember.'

Callum's attacker, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, was described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark hooded top. 

Detective Inspector Liam Boden of Greater Manchester Police said last week it was an 'appalling attack on a young man who was raising money to help remember all those who gave their lives'.

The 15-year-old said: 'Most of my mates were surprised that I still carried on selling the poppies'

He added: 'At this stage of our inquiries, we're keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act.

'Given the initial description we have of the offender, it may be that he was under the influence of something but whatever his motivation, his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life.'

'It is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body.

'Understandably, both he and his family are in a state of total shock and cannot believe someone would do this.

'We need to find who ever is responsible for this crime and I would therefore appeal to anyone who has information.'
