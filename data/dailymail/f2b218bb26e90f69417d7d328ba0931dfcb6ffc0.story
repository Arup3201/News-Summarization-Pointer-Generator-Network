The new version of wi-fi will offer higher speeds and more reliability - and is built to deal with several devices at once. It could be on the market late next year, according to router manufacturer Broadcom

A new version of wi-fi designed for homes where several devices are connecting to the network at once, all demanding data, could be on the shelves by the end of next year.

The new version should mean that streaming video and online gaming become much more practical in ordinary households - where current wi-fi standards often fail to deliver reliable service in a 'real world' situation.

Up to 22 per cent of households now have more than six wi-fi devices using their networks at once, according to networking specialists Broadcom.

Broadcom has confirmed that it will show off the new version of wi-fi at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas early next year - and ship products in 2012.

The new version of wi-fi  - known as 802.11ac - is designed to deal with households where lots of devices are connecting to the same wi-fi network.

It'll offer roughly double the range, should be more reliable at 'hanging on' to a connection, and will also work with previous devices.

The new version of wi-fi can deliver speeds of up to 1.3Gbps per second - in theory, delivering entire DVDs' worth of data in seconds.

'There’s a much wider 
highway for the traffic - and up to 20 channels to use,' says Rahul Patel of Broadcom

Downloading music should be near-instant, and streaming video through the home should offer no problems.

Even with the fastest version of wi-fi currently on offer - 802.11n - streaming video can cause problems.

Those problems become even more pronounced when several users connect at once.

Broadcom's VP of its wireless division, Rahul Patel, said, 'At 5Ghz you have 20 odd 
channels to use so you have more power and reach, there’s a much wider 
highway for the traffic.'

The new version of wi-fi will have roughly double the range - and up to 20 channels to cut interference and improve reliability

So far, the standard has not been ratified by the Wi-Fi Alliance - but Broadcom were hopeful that the standard would be ratified next year, and the company could deliver devices for year end.

'Consumers are demanding seamless, pervasive connectivity — something that will be possible with new technologies such as 802.11ac,' said Broadcom via a release.

Broadcom's research shows that 22 per cent of households now own six or more wi-fi compatible devices - a statistic that has quadrupled in the last three years.
