Matthew Hudson-Smith produced a storming final leg to win Commonwealth Games gold for England's men in the 4x400 metres relay.

The 19-year-old, competing at his first senior major championship, picked up the baton in second, but passed Trinidad and Tobago's Zwede Hewitt with 200m to go and, just when it seemed he had saved nothing for the finish, managed to hold off Chris Brown of the Bahamas to take the title.

The quartet, which also featured Conrad Williams, Michael Bingham and Daniel Awde, came home in three minutes 00.46 seconds to win by 0.05secs at a drenched Hampden Park.

The England quartet were missing Martyn Rooney, who finished fourth in the individual, but his absence was not felt.

Hudson-Smith's performance continues his meteoric rise from complete unknown to world-class one-lap runner.

He came into 2014 with a personal best from indoors of 48.76secs, having been predominantly a 200m sprinter, but has stepped up in distance and he proceeded to batter that time into oblivion.

His PB went down to 45.80s in May and then to 44.97 at this very stadium last month.

In between times he was disqualified at the British Championships, but he has bounced back in some style.

His split on Saturday night was timed at 44.56.

Raw emotion: The quartet couldn't believe it after Hudson-Smith pipped the Bahamas on the line
