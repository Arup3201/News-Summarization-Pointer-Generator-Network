A 20-year-old man and a teenage girl kidnapped and tortured a grandfather to death in a park restroom after he gave them a ride home, police have said.

Concerned family members had been searching for 58-year-old Mark Thomas after he was last seen giving two young people a ride home near Kansas City, Missouri on Friday.

But on Sunday morning, police found his body in a park at Smithville Lake.

The two people, 20-year-old Zachary M. Lisle and a girl who has not been named as she is a juvenile, had allegedly made him pull over before smacking him across the head with an object.

They then allegedly took him to a park restroom near the lake and bound his ankles, wired a bag around his head and partially severed his ring finger, KSHB reported.

Kansas City police said family members 
found his car at the North Star Village mobile home park, where Lisle had been staying.

Inside the vehicle, authorities found large amounts of blood, a knife and a 
knife sheath.

They also allegedly found that several of Thomas' ATM cards had been used at various locations throughout the metro since his disappearance.

On Sunday,
 his body was found at the park. Court documents stated that he died from a blow to the head.

Lisle has been charged with first degree murder, three counts of armed criminal action, and one count of kidnapping. His bond has been set at $1 million.

The juvenile was also arrested, but the Clay County prosecutor's office did not specify what charges she might face.

Relatives, who had set up a Facebook group in a desperate bid to find the beloved retired grandfather, shared their grief in a statement.

'Mark was someone that you could meet and spend 5 minutes talking to and feel like you've made a life-long friend,' one relative, Katrina Williams, said.

'He never had an unkind thing to say about anyone nor a dishonorable intention in his soul. He would have given anyone the shirt off his back. As is evident by the public outreach on the page.

'He touched countless lives. The world has lost a truly amazing person. We are heartbroken.'

She added on the Facebook group: 'Unfortunately, it is with a broken heart that I must update this and tell everyone that Mark has gone to be with the Lord.

'On behalf of our family and all of our friends, we want to thank you all for the outstanding response and shares in our attempts I find and bring him home. Much love to all.'
