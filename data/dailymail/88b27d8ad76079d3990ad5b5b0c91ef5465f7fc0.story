Snapchat’s popularity isn’t showing any signs of slowing after it leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app.

Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November.

Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent.

Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the Snapchat self-destructing messaging app, compared to 24% of Twitter app users. Snapchat’s popularity has more than doubled from 12% in November. Facebook is still the most popular social media app on 76%. At the bottom of the list (pictured) is Tumblr on 6.3%

Last year, its co-founder Evan Spiegel turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) acquisition bid from Facebook.

Facebook then launched a rival app called Slingshot in June. 

Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, followed this with the launch of Bolt.

In July, Ashton Kutcher tweeted his support for another Snapchat rival, called Taptalk.

Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location. 

Snapchat's popularity is also growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the the younger age group.

The figures were taken from comScore’s June Mobile Metrix report.

At the bottom of the list is Tumblr, which now accounts for 6.3 per cent of users.

Vine is used by 10.7 per cent of millennials, and Pinterest is just above on 17.9 per cent.

Google sits in fifth on 18 per cent.

comScore's vice president, marketing and insights, Andrew Lipsman wrote: 'Long term success in the social media sector is no given.

'Achieving critical mass is an important step in eventually reaching the winner’s circle, and with Snapchat it would appear to be right in that sweet spot. 

'If usage begins to accelerate significantly from this point forward, who knows how big it can eventually get?'

Last year, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) acquisition bid from Facebook.

At the time, co-founder Evan Spiegel said Mark Zuckerberg warned him his firm planned to launch a rival if he didn’t accept the offer.

True to his word, Zuckerberg’s Facebook launched Slingshot in June.

Last month, reports claimed Snapchat was in talks with investors, including Alibaba Group Holding, for financing that could value the company at $10 billion (£5.9 billion).

Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, then launched Bolt, but only in selected countries, including New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa.

In July, Ashton Kutcher tweeted his support for another rival, called Taptalk.

Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location.
