Victim: Ryan King, 20, who died after he was stabbed in the neck with a glass bottle at a 40th birthday party in Devon

A former boxer murdered his great nephew by slashing his throat with a wine glass during a family party at a country mansion, a court has heard.

Raymond Dupree is accused of killing 20-year-old Ryan King by stabbing him with a wine glass, after the elder man complained about music being played by teenage girls in the early hours.

Mr King was said to have calmly stuck up for the 13- and 14-year-old girls who were at the gathering, held on August 20 last year to celebrate Mr King's pregnant mother's 40th birthday.

Raymond Dupree, 68, argued with victim Ryan King, 20, after he intervened when Dupree told a group of 13 and 14-year-old girls to stop playing music.

It was alleged that Mr King told him to calm down after he ordered the girls to go to bed at 3am on August 20, 2011.

But Dupree responded by picking up a wine glass and stabbing it into his neck.

The party was being held at a sprawling rural estate in South Molton, Devon, for Mr King's pregnant mother's 40th birthday.

Witnesses said Dupree had been clenching a glass when he punched Mr
King in the neck as the party came to an end.

As Mr King fell to the floor clutching his wound, Dupree 
was said to have shown no remorse, saying: 'I’ve done him,' before 
leaving the estate and walking home.

A terrified Mr King told shocked onlookers that he thought he was going 
to die, while friends frantically called for help.

Mr King was taken to 
hospital but died later as a result of his injuries.

Speaking at the opening of the murder trial at Exeter Crown Court today,
prosecutor Simon Laws QC said Dupree 'grossly over-reacted to a trivial
dispute'.

Mr Laws said: 'A recurring theme is that he believed Ryan owed him respect and it was disrespectful to stand up to him. He felt it was very serious, serious enough for him to lash out.'

He added: 'There was simply no reason for Dupree to have used any 
force at all, still less the fatal force that he actually used.

'Mr King lost his life quite needlessly. His death was a product of Dupree’s bad temper and his pride.'

Exeter Crown Court heard Dupree and Mr King were among around 30 people 
celebrating Lisa Wilson’s birthday at the luxury Snurridge Manor House 
near South Molton in north Devon, which was owned by Dupree’s sister.

Revellers said the party was 'going well', with music, a buffet and karaoke.

But, as guests began to leave the party, witnesses said the atmosphere began to change.

Mr Laws told the court: 'Dupree was behaving in a manner which was, at the very least, overbearing.

The court heard how Mr King, pictured, told Dupree to calm down after he ordered teenage girls to go to bed at 3am

'Mr King intervened on behalf of a young girl that was bearing the brunt of the defendant’s temper.'

He said Mr King asked Dupree to leave the girl alone, prompting Dupree to say his relative should 'respect his elders'.

Dupree had apparently become angry that one girl had broken two glasses,
and that the teenagers, who had been drinking, should have been in bed.

Giving evidence, Mr King’s friend Shane Thorne broke down in court as he recalled the attack.

He said there had been 'a bit of a commotion about the music' at the 
party, adding: 'Ryan followed [Dupree] into the kitchen to ask why he 
was doing it to (squabbling with) his own family.

'Dupree hit Ryan in his throat with a glass. Ryan was really shaken up. I
walked up to him (Mr King) and saw the gash on his throat and all the 
blood.

'He kept saying: "I’m going to die".'

Dupree, who was stopped by police as he walked home from the party, 
initially said the incident had been an accident, and that it was a 'family thing' that had got out of hand.

He later said his great nephew had 'offered him outside for a fight' 
before launching a pre-emptive attack on the 20-year-old. Dupree, who 
lived at nearby Bishop’s Nympton, denies murder.

The trial continues.
