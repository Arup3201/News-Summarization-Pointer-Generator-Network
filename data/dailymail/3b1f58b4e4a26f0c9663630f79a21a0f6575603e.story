John McAfee has not been captured, despite a cryptic post on his own blog saying that he is in police custody.

Belize national police confirmed to MailOnline on Sunday that the whereabouts of the multimillionaire software developer are still unknown.

Additionally, authorities have issued no arrest warrant in the murder of McAfee's neighbor and fellow American Gregory Faull.

Multi-millionaire software developer John McAfee appeared on CNN for an interview on Friday and his blog was updated claiming 'unconfirmed reports' he had been arrest on Saturday

McAfee, 67, is wanted for questioning as a 'person of interest' in the case and remains at large, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said.

McAfee's blog, whoismcafee.com, was updated on Saturday 
afternoon with an 'unconfirmed report that John McAfee has been captured
 at the border of Belize and Mexico.'

'That is not true. He is not in police custody,' Officer Martinez told MailOnline on Sunday morning.

McAfee has frequently used the rambling blog to keep the world updated on his bizarre attempts to evade captured in the Central American nation, which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection.

He has in the past claimed that there exists enough material to keep the blog going for a year and has also stated that should anything happen to him a man named Chad would be put in charge of posting information - and it seems that day has come.

In Belize, a source at the U.S. Embassy speaking anonymously to reporters said that friends of McAfee denied he had been captured and that they and the police had no information on a possible arrest.

Rumors that the software developer has been apprehended come directly after an interview with CNN, in which he claimed his life was in danger and that he had tired of life on the run.

McAfee has been the subject of police interest since his neighbour, Gregory Faull, was discovered with a bullet in his head on November 11th.

In the brief talk with a CNN reporter, McAfee said, 'I will certainly not turn myself in, and I will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog.'

Claiming that he will either be arrested or get away, clarifying 'Get away doesn't mean leave the country. It means they will, No.1, find the murderer of Mr. Faull and, No.2, the people of this country - who are by and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out.'

McAfee and Faull repeatedly had run-ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with Wired claimed that the killers of Mr. Faull were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbour.

In fact, the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after another for McAfee, which began in May when his home was raided and police said they found multiple firearms and the 67-year-old living with a 17-year-old girl.

The CNN report also noted that police in Belize have said they don't consider 
McAfee a suspect in the killing; they say they only want him for questioning.

And yesterday, the ecentric fugitive millionaire 
software mogul, dropped the f-bomb on 
live television Friday while explaining his dislike for local 
politicians.

‘I
 do not donate to any political party. When I was asked to donate, I 
said, “Get the f*** off my property,”’ McAfee, 67, said during a 
telephone interview with CNBC from ‘an undisclosed location.’

He then apologized to the cable network for his verbal slip-up, one of many recent gaffes.

McAfee was in the midst 
of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed Belizean 
officers allegedly stormed his compound, arrested him and detained him 
for 14 hours with no food or water, and then let him go without charges.

When
 CNBC reporter, Robert Frank, asked McAfee why he thought the police had
 done that, he said it was because he ‘does not play by the rules.’

McAfee
 said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy, 
including police departments and homeless agencies, but not through the 
Belizean government itself.

‘I
 don’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out 
because if I give $5 million to the government, $10,000 goes to the 
people and $4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the 
politicians,’ he said. ‘I give directly to the people. And I have been 
doing this all along.’

McAfee, 
founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name, 
said he has been hiding out in the jungles if Belize and wearing 
disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies.

He would not say what the disguises look like because he has ‘a feeling’ he will be wearing them again soon, he said.

John McAfee has been a follower of alternative therapies and philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his business

The
 fugitive software mogul has been on the run from local police since 
November 11, the day after his American neighbour, Greg Faull, a 
52-year-old contractor from Florida, was found shot in the head.

Two
 days before Faull's body was discovered, four of McAfee's dogs were 
poisoned to death, making McAfee a 'person of interest,' Belize 
authorities have said.

McAfee
 says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in. He has said 
on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody.

He has also said the he was set up by the Belizean government and that 
it all goes back to a bribe he didn't pay to a politician.

But he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out.

Over the past three weeks
 he has given multiple media appearances, including two interviews with 
CNBC, an interview with The Daily Telegraph, an interview with ABC News,
 and an interview with Wired Magazine.

He also set up a blog,
 where he details his jungle adventures, his ongoing claims of 
government corruption, his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath
 salts, and his own personal investigation into Faull’s murder.

A
 few days after the news of his hiding made headlines, McAfee logged 
onto the Internet to seek technical support on how phone tracking works,
 Gizmodo reported.

Not surprisingly, skeptics are disputing the validity of McAfee’s claims.

The
 fugitive software mogul told CNBC Friday that he is beginning to run 
out of money and is having trouble getting cash from his bank in Belize.

‘My life has been up and down from a comfort standpoint,’ he told CNBC.

McAfee said he has no plans to leave the
 Central American country bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south 
and west by Guatemala, and to the east by the Caribbean Sea.

‘This is my home,’ he said.

McAfee has not been formally charged with murder and is only wanted for questioning, according to Belize National Security Ministry spokesman Raphael Martinez.

The country’s prime minister Dean Barrow has called McAfee ‘extremely paranoid, even bonkers.’

McAfee,
 who relocated to Belize in 2008 after losing an estimated $96 million 
due to bad investments, founded his namesake software company in 1987, 
initially running it out of his home in California.

He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994.

McAfee
 was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in 
New York City from 1968 to 1970. He has also worked for Xerox, Computer 
Sciences Corporation and Lockheed.
