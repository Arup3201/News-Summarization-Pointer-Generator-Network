Commenting on the high volume of sales, Paul Gainer, executive vice president for Disney Retail,  said: 'The powerful connection families around the world have with Frozen and its characters is truly a phenomenon that has only continued to grow over the last 12 months.

'This holiday season Disney Consumer Products has expanded product categories and doubled our presence at retail to meet the strong demand for everything Frozen.'  

Disney Consumer Products released the sales figures earlier this month but did not disclose exact dollar sales. 

Building on the craze, the company is set to launch 16 new Frozen-themed food and health products over the coming months, including branded fruit, juice, yogurt, bandages and a complete oral care line. 

Smash hit: Frozen, released on November 27 2013 in the U.S., went on to become the fifth-highest grossing film of all time, raking in $1.2 billion in box office earnings worldwide.

The huge demand for anything Frozen created a shortage of merchandise on Disney store shelves all over North American, as the popularity caught Disney Consumer Products by surprise. 

However, the limited availability of popular items may have helped ignite the frenzy for everything Frozen, which continues to swell as the holiday season kicks off.

According to a survey by the National Retail Federation, an estimated 2.6 million children planned to dress up as one of Disney's Frozen characters this Halloween.
