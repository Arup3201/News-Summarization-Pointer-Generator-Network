The SNP are on course to sweep across Scotland, wiping out senior Labour and Lib Dems, a devastating new poll showed today.

Labour election chief Douglas Alexander and Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander are among those who face losing their seats to the Scottish nationalists.

Polling in 16 seats by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found Nicola Sturgeon's nationalist party ahead in 15 of the 16 seats, putting the SNP on course to hold the balance of power after May's election.

Labour has been rocked by the extraordinary surge in support for the SNP in the wake of the independence referendum in September, despite voters rejecting their plan for separation.

First Minister Alex Salmond quit as SNP leader to be replaced by Miss Sturgeon, but now plans to stand for election to Westminster.

Polls have repeatedly suggested the SNP will make huge gains, with Labour facing heavy losses and the Lib Dems and Tories wiped out altogether.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been called back to the frontline to support new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy in an attempt to stem the losses. 

Lord Ashcroft's research focused mainly on Labour seats in areas which had voted in favour of independence, or only narrowly voted against.

Of the 16 seats, it found only Glasgow North East is likely to back Ed Miliband's party.

The swing from Labour to the SNP varies from 21 to 27 per cent. If a swing of 21 per cent was repeated across Scotland, Labour would lose 35 of its 41 seats in Scotland.

Writing on his website Lord Ashcroft said: 'Douglas Alexander, Labour's campaign manager and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, would lose his Paisley & Renfrewshire South seat with a swing to the SNP of 25 per cent.

'Elsewhere, (Alex) Salmond would be back in Westminster with a comfortable majority over the Lib Dems, and Chief Secretary Danny Alexander would lose by 29 points.'

The surge in support for the SNP puts Nicola Sturgeon's party on course to hold the balance of power, with Labour's Ed Miliband falling short of an overall majority

The most popular outcome for May, Lord Ashcroft found, is a Labour-SNP coalition, with 39 per cent of voters, including 62 per cent of SNP supporters and 79 per cent of Labour-SNP switchers, favouring that option.

Just 38 per cent of people said they were dissatisfied with David Cameron as Prime Minister and would rather have Ed Miliband.

Lord Ashcroft said an SNP swing of 21 per cent, as found in his research, repeated across Scotland on May 7 would endanger 35 of Labour's 41 seats there.

He added: 'But we cannot assume such a uniform swing. Most of the seats in this survey are in areas which returned a particularly strong yes vote in September, where the SNP attraction will naturally be greater; in future rounds of research we may find a different pattern where support for independence was lower.

'Even so, the prospect of losing heartland seats will be a blow to Labour's hopes: every seat they lose in Scotland means another they have to win from the Conservatives in England, while the national polls could not be much narrower.'

Lord Ashcroft said the polls should be seen simply as a snapshot, not a prediction, but advised the Labour party it has 'room for improvement' in its electioneering over the next three months.

Just over two thirds of those who have switched their support from Labour to the SNP said they had definitely ruled out voting Labour again this year, leaving the party with a third of voters who are 'at least open to the idea of returning', Lord Ashcroft said. 

Mr Murphy, elected the new Scottish Labour leader after Johann Lamont quit last year, admitted the polls show that Scottish Labour is 'well behind and has a big gap to close'.

He added: 'In the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are David Cameron and the Tories.

"It is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government. The more seats the SNP get from Labour, the more likely it is the Tories will be the biggest party and David Cameron will get into government through the back door.

"That would be a terrible outcome for Scotland but it's what might happen if Scotland votes SNP."
