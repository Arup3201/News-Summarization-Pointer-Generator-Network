This season of 19 Kids and Counting has charted Jill Duggar's courtship with Derick Dillard. And tonight, in the finale episode, we will finally see him pop the big question.

In a clip from the show, which airs at 9pm on TLC, a nervous Derrick, 25, is seen preparing for his date with 23-year-old Jill, the fourth child of Jim Bob and Michelle, who are devout fundamentalist Christians.

As he is seen doing his hair and choosing his clothes, he says: 'I went to bed last night, I was just looking at the rain and thinking, wow, I'm gonna propose tomorrow, to Jill, the most incredible girl ever.'Scroll down for video

What happens next... A nervous Derick Dillard gazes at Jill Duggar just moments before he proposes to her

Derick admits that a proposal may not come as a complete surprise to his girlfriend though.

'I have an idea that she, I'm sure, suspects something, cause she's really smart so it's hard to pull anything over on her,' he says. 'So I think she'll be suspecting something but maybe she doesn't know how it's going to happen or what exactly to expect.'

Unsure whether to keep the ring in its box, or slip it into a pocket, Derick calls on his mother for advice.

She assures him that keeping the ring in the box is the thing to do, and confirms that it cannot be seen when he slips it into his inside jacket pocket.

Casual: The couple are seen taking a walk after lunch with two of Jill's sisters trailing behind as chaperones

Surprise: Derick and Jill are stopped on their walk by country singer Walker Hayes, who, it turns out, penned a song about them especially for the occasion

Another clip from later in the episode, published on People.com, shows Derrick pulling off the first of his surprises - a serenade from country singer Walker Hayes, who had penned a song about them especially for the occasion.

Derick admits that as he and Jill were walking from the Mexican restaurant where they had just dined, he was 'trying to play it cool.'

'I was going over what I was going to say in my head,' he reveals.

Nerves: Unsure how to carry the ring, Derick calls on his mother for advice. She suggests keeping the ring in the box, and confirms that it cannot be seen when he slips it into his jacket pocket

Initially the couple are trailed by two 
of Jill's sisters, but the girls slope off, leaving the 
soon-to-be-betrothed couple to enjoy the music alone. As the song 
progresses, two other musicians, who had been masquerading as 
bystanders, join in, leaving Jill in little doubt that this is a special
 occasion.

As Derick predicted though, Jill already had her suspicions.

'I ... am like on the alert, basically, like, "What's going on?"' she says.

The
 clip concludes at this point, saving the big moment for tonight's 
episode. But as the season finale filmed in April, we already know that 
Jill accepted Derick's proposal.

Frugal: Jill and Derick have listed their wedding gift registry at Wal-Mart, asking for just modest items

Study buddies: Derick holds a degree in accounting while Jill is currently training to be a midwife

Happy couple: Jill was first introduced to Derick online through her father Jim Bob, and the two only met after several months of Skyping from afar

The couple, who made the announcement a day after they got engaged in a video on People.com, celebrated by holding hands for the very first time.

'I
 am so happy,' Jill told the camera.

Derick adds: 'It
 was great to hold her hand for the first time.'

The pair were initially introduced by Jill's father, Jim Bob, 48, who struck up a friendship with Derick several years
 ago, the two subsequently becoming 'prayer partners' while Derick was doing 
missionary work in Nepal.

'The
 first time we talked, he was in Japan, we met in Nepal [where her father played chaperone], he spent time 
in India and Israel and then came back to Arkansas where he met my 
family,' Jill explains.

Double date! Derick and Jill, seen here with Jill's sister Jessa and her boyfriend Ben, have been spending lots of time together since they started courting

Practice makes perfect? The young couple can be seen here cuddling up with Jill's nephew in an Instagram snap shared by her brother, Josh Duggar captioned 'Congrats to Jill Duggar & Derick Dillard #bf #gf'

Pitter patter of tiny feet? Starting their own family will surely be the next step after their upcoming marriage

The Duggars, from Tontitown, Arkansas, define courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is 
appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families.

Only
 once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold
 hands for the first time, but they will have to wait until their 
wedding day before sharing their first kiss.

The family first entered the spotlight in 2008 with a TV show titled 17 Kids and 
Counting - but have since added two more to their brood.

Smile
 for the cameras! The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on 
TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of 
Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17  - now 19 - children

They
 are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches
 that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should 
happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing
 their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating
 the world [but] we are following our convictions.'

Jill
 is not the first of her siblings to find a partner. She follows in the 
footsteps of her brother, Josh, who is married with three children, and 
younger sister Jessa, 21, who is currently planning a wedding to Ben 
Seewald, 19.
