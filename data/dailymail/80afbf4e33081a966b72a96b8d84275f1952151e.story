The Cairns house in which eight children were murdered last week, will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial.

Member of Parliament Gavin King said the fate of the public housing home at 34 Murray Street, Manoora was decided upon by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community.

'It's the right thing to do going forward to help with the grieving process,' Mr King said.

'It certainly won't be the State Government coming in over the top and deciding what that will look like, or indeed the timing,' he added of the future memorial.

While the house remains a crimes scene since the bodies of the four boys and four girls, between the ages of two and 14, were found on Friday, mourning friends and family continue to lay their tributes at a fig tree in a nearby park.

One of the ideas being circulated for the memorial is for the park to be extended to include the property's land.

Police are still unable to set a time frame to when their investigations will finish at the home of Raina Thaiday, 37, who is also known as Mersane Warria, and when the memorial will subsequently be built. 

'We are not even a tenth of the way through. There is a lot more work to be done and we will just keep doing it,' Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told the ABC of the ongoing investigation. 

Mr Asnicar said that hundreds of witnesses had already submitted statements to police, with more expected in the coming week. 

Plans are being made for funerals for the children however no date has been set. 

Mother-of-nine Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, has been formally charged with the stabbing deaths of the eight children in the Cairns home on Friday morning

Thaiday, who has been formally charged with the deaths of four girls, aged 14, 12, 11, and two, and four boys, aged 9, 8, 6, and five -who were found in their Murray Street home by their 20-year-old brother on Friday morning - 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet,' her lawyer said today. 

She is being held in Cairns Base Hospital under police guard, and did not appear in court when the charges against her were mentioned on Monday.

'She's presently on an involuntary treatment order, which means she will be assessed so once she has been assessed then it may go to the mental health court at that stage,' her lawyer, Steve Macfarlane, said outside Cairns courthouse.

'She's coping as best as she can in Cairns Base Hospital where she will be for a while.'

Asked by journalists about her state, Mr Macfarlane said: 'I'm not a doctor, but I think she probably knows what happened but doesn't realise it, it hasn't sunk in.'

Magistrate Alan Comans adjourned the case until January 30 and dismissed a request for is to be referred to the mental health court. 

'Until she's finished her treatment and police have finished their investigation there's not a lot that can be done,' Mr Macfarlane said.

Thaiday's lawyer also confirmed the alleged murderer has had visitors to her bedside.

'I'm aware that she has been visited by some people but how close a family member they are and how many people I am not aware of,' Mr Macfarlane said.

Inside court, no family attended the hearing as Mr Macfarlane requested the trial be heard in a mental health court.

Mr Comans rejected the request, saying: 'No, there is no need.'  

As police try and determine what could have driven Thaiday to allegedly murder seven of her nine children, along with a niece,  new details have emerged regarding her troubled past and recent erratic behaviour.

Neighbours have told how she reportedly ran through the streets on Thursday night screaming 'Don't let them take them away from us. God bless us. Forgive me for what I'll do'.

A local told The Courier Mail that after recently finding God, Thaiday believed mobile phones were 'the work of the devil'.

The Australian reported Thaiday's, whose nine children had five different fathers, struggled to find a stable home after falling pregnant at 14 and was allegedly attacked with a hammer a decade ago. 

An uncle of the eight children said Thaiday had begun expressing increased religious devotion, attending St Margaret's Anglican Church in Westcourt every Sunday for the month leading up to the alleged mass murder.

'She had this church DVD she was always watching. She'd started preaching to me in the last week or so. Always talking about God,' he said.

More neighbours revealed Thaiday was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found.

Senior investigators refused to rule out the possibility that drugs were a factor in Thaiday's behaviour.

The grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!'

Shortly after she gave birth to her first child she moved into cramped public housing in Manoora and was shunted between houses as her family grew, The Australian reported.

Anna Jackson, who has known Thaiday for more than 20 years, said she had been abused by a former partner, who allegedly bashed her on the head with a hammer.

Less than a week ago, one of the children's fathers moved out of the home  they shared after the children's uncle reported hearing fighting.

'He's been heard shouting at her that if she didn't stop, he was leaving. And then he did, moving into a house with other relatives,' he said.

'The dad wanted to take the kids up to Bamaga. That's what he told me he was doing, he'd been talking about it for six weeks.'

Thaiday appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns hospital, where she is being treated for stab wounds to the chest, which were possibly self-inflicted. 

At the house were heartbreaking scenes as family members made their way up to a willow tree where tributes have been left for the young alleged victims.

She was supported by other family members as she wailed, her eyes closed in raw grief as she clutched a small white towel to her face to wipe away her tears.

Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable.

He was frail and unable to hold his own body up as he screamed his children's names into the sky in a hoarse voice. 

The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the tree.

'Raiden', 'Rodney', 'Azza' and 'baby girl', the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably.

Detective Inspector Bruno Ansicar told reporters on Sunday the horrific scene was taking its toll on police.

'It's clearly the most tragic event we've had to deal with (in Cairns),' Insp Ansicar told reporters.

Vigils and memorials for the slain children, who ranged in age from two to 14, were held throughout Queensland on Sunday. 

Townsville and the Brisbane suburb of Inala also hosted memorials.
