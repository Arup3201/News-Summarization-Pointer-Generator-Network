His title as one of nation's most popular entertainers is confirmed.

And with a career spanning seven decades, a glamorous wife, half a dozen adoring children and an OBE to his name, audiences could be forgiven for thinking that Sir Bruce Forsyth hasn't got a care in the world.

But as the 85-year-old entertainer continues to delight viewers in his current role on Strictly Come Dancing, it has been revealed that he is also nursing his first wife as she battles with dementia.

The presenter has been caring for first wife Penny Calvert, 83, since 2008, when the former dancer’s health deteriorated to such an extent that she was moved to a residential care home.

Sadness: Bruce and Penny in 1961. The veteran entertainer has been a regular visitor to his ex-wife's nursing home, where she has been treated for dementia since 2008

And despite divorcing 40 years ago Sir Bruce remains a frequent visitor at the Kent care where Penny now lives and is apparently determined to keep her involved in family life.

His daughter Julie - his second child
with Penny– has spoken of her father's ongoing commitment to his former wife even as here health deteriorated.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror she said: 'It has become impossible to care for her anymore. My father and I continue to visit her. She might not recognise us anymore but we won’t forget her.’

Such is Sir Bruce's loyalty to Penny was received as a guest of honour at a special Mother's Day party at his Surrey home in 2009 where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers.

The event was attended by Sir Bruce's current wife Wilnelia, 54, all six of his children, eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren - his second wife Anthea Red fern, 65 even telephone to offer her good wishes.

Julie, 55, added: ‘We stood in a line for a photo and 
as I glanced around me, at my sisters, my half-sisters, half-brother, 
step-mother and mother, it struck me that this was probably my father’s 
greatest achievement.

How it was: Bruce fathered three children with Penny before their divorce in 1973

‘To
have three wives and six children who adore him and get along, without 
acrimony, rows or bitterness, is extraordinary. We are like a huge, 
extended family. When we arrived, he gave the women a bouquet of 
flowers. It was so typical of Dad’

But Penny did not appear in the family photograph and has rarely been seen in public since her split from Sir Bruce in the seventies.

She was also guest at her ex-husband's 80th birthday party in 2008 but after suffering a stroke that year was forced to move into residential care.

A source close to the legendary entertainer told the Mirror that despite two subsequent marriages Sir Bruce has remained close contact with his former wife and has been saddened by her illness.

The source said: 'Penny and Bruce divorced a long time ago but things heal over with time and considering there are three marriages involved in his life, everyone is very friendly and civilised.

'It is a testament to his current wife, Wilnelia, that Bruce has such a wonderful and close family, which includes Penny.'

Second time lucky: Bruce would go on to marry his Generation Game hostess, Anthea Redfern, with whom he has two daughters

Penny and Bruce met at the Windmill Theatre in London and became a song and dance double act before going on to marry in 1953.

They
had three daughters together, Julie, Debbie, 55, and Laura, 51, but 
their 20 years of marriage were wracked by the pressures of Bruce's 
growing fame - and repeated infidelities.

The pair finally parted company in 1973 after a decade of living apart lat the
same year he married former Generation Game hostess Anthea Redfearn, 
with whom he would have two daughters before their eventual divorce six years later.

Bruce
then married Puerto Rican former Miss World Wilnelia Merced – who is 32
years his junior – in 1983, three-years after they met while judging 
the 30th annual Miss Work pageant at London’s Royal Albert Hall.

Happy couple: Bruce with his third wife, former Miss World Wilnelia Merced who he married 20 years ago, sources close to the star have credited her with helping him maintain close relationships with his ex-wives

Four years later she gave birth to his first and only son, Jonathan.

The presenter has previously opened up about the strain his frequent touring would put on his first marriage.

‘Sadly, such prolonged absences eventually put a great strain on our marriage,’ he said. ‘There are always temptations. Whether you take them or not is up to you. It depends how happy your private life is.’
