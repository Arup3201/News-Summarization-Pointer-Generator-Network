A police officer who was captured on video pointing his semi-automatic rifle and threatening protesters in Ferguson, Missouri has resigned.

Lt. Ray Albers, who worked for the St Ann Police Department for 20 years, was put on indefinite leave from the St. Ann Police Department after video emerged of him swearing at protesters. 

But he resigned on Thursday after the city's board of police commissioners met and recommended to the board of aldermen that he be fired or quit, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 

Albers had been among the officers called in from neighboring areas to deal with the protests after Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson gunned down 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9.

Threats: Lt. Ray Albers, a 20-year veteran of the St Ann Police Department, was seen raising his gun and swearing at protesters on August 19. He has now resigned from his position

Captured: In the video, the police officer could be heard telling the protesters: 'I will f***ing kill you'

'I'm not condoning [Albers'] behavior whatsoever,' Chief Aaron Jiminez said on Thursday, the Post-Dispatch reported. 'It's very hard because he is a good friend, he was a good boss.

'There's going to be those who didn't like him who are high-fiving now. Altogether it's going to be a black eye on the city of St. Ann because he represented our department.'

On August 19, Albers had been captured in a video - that was later shared to YouTube -  showing him with his gun raised and telling the crowd: 'I will f***ing kill you. Get back.'

When asked his name, he responds: 'Go f*** yourself.' 

He only lowered his gun when a senior approached him and instructed him to put it down - an interaction that noted by the protesters.

Under control: He eventually put his gun down when instructed to by a senior officer. Authorities said before the cameras started rolling, protesters had thrown urine at the cop. He had also seen a man with a gun

Jiminez explained that, before the video started recording the scene, protesters had thrown water and urine at the police officer. He then spotted a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a gun.

Victim: The protests came after Michael Brown, 18, was gunned down by a police officer on August 9

After hearing a gun shot - not from the gun the men were carrying - he raised his own weapon and the group started to record him, Jiminez said. 

They were 'waiting for something stupid to happen, which they got,' he said. 'They won on this one.'

He said that the officer became worried when the crowd got close, but that his choice of language was still inexcusable.  

Jiminez added that if the incident had happened at any other time, he and the board believed Albers would have only been suspended without pay, the Post-Dispatch reported.

'He solved burglaries, homicides, stealings, you name it, the guy did it,' Jiminez said. 'He chose to work 14-hour days... Bottom line is... I have to do what's best for the citizens.' 

Albers' resignation comes after another police officer was fired in relation to the unrest. 

Glendale Officer Matthew Pappert lost his job on Thursday after he commented on his Facebook saying the protesters should be 'put down like rabid dogs'.

In another comment, he said: 'Where is a Muslim with a backpack when you need them?' 

Pappert later apologized, saying he was 'deeply remorseful' for the comments.
