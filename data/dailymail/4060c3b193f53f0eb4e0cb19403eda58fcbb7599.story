Showing off his crowing glory, this stallion looks like he is auditioning for a role in a shampoo advert as he flicks his shiny, long auburn mane for his audience.

The four-year-old buckskin lusitano was snapped horsing around in Florida, USA, by an equine photographer who said he even 'smiled at the camera.'

As these photographs show the aptly impressively named Veneno Imperial knows how to attract attention and strike a pose in these pictures by Darlene Wohlart.

Get my best side: Veneno Imperial, a four-year-old buckskin lusitano, was photographed flicking his hair and striking a pose for the camera in Florida, USA

Strike a pose: Professional equine photographer Darlene, 64 said 'He looked like he'd just stepped out 
of a salon, he seemed very happy with the way he looked, even looking 
like he was smiling at the camera'

A professional equine photographer the 64-year-old, from Ocala, Florida, said she had photographed many horses over the years but was still surprised with this stallion.

She said: 'He looked like he'd just stepped out of a salon, he seemed very happy with the way he looked, even looking like he was smiling at the camera.

'When I was photographing him it seemed like he knew what was happening, like I was doing a shoot for a magazine or something, he was definitely showing off for the ladies.

'Of course he was just shaking his head as horses do but I think the pictures are hysterical,' she added.

Darlene has been photographing horses all over the world and has more than 32 years experience.

She said: 'I have clients in the US, in Britain and I used to travel to South America as well.

'Now I live in Ocala which is known to have the most horses of any county in the United States, so it's perfect for me.'
