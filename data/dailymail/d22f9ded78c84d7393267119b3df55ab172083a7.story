From a castle to a very well stocked bar, these extraordinary pictures show the elaborate sheds built by Britons across the country.

The entries into the Shed of the Year competition include pubs, children's playrooms and even one with an allotment on its roof.

The pictures, released on the eve of the competition, come as research shows the average Briton spends one year of their live in a shed.
