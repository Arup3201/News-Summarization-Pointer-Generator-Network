A great-grandfather died three months after he was left 'traumatised' when he discovered a trusted carer had stolen from him.

Patrick Murray was left shocked after CCTV cameras set up by his family caught carer Claire Louise O'Hara stealing from his room in Stainton Way Care Home in Coulby Newham, North Yorkshire.

O'Hara, 37, has now been found guilty of theft after evidence, given by Mr Murray before his death, helped to convict her.

'Kind and funny' great-grandfather Patrick Murray was left shocked after a care home worker stole from him

Teesside Magistrates' Court heard cameras were installed by Mr Murray's relatives who suspected money was going missing.

Prosecutor Lynne Roberts-Plowman said: 'Family noticed that money had been going missing. They spoke to the care home manager who agreed to allow CCTV to be placed facing his wardrobe.'

The cameras captured footage of O'Hara entering Mr Murray's empty room and looking for the key to his safe, which she then opens and removes an item, believed to be a wallet.

She slips something into her pocket before locking the safe and putting the key back.

On the day of the theft, the anniversary of Mr Murray's wife's death, his daughter-in-law arrived at 11.30am to go for a day out, setting the CCTV running.

It was later discovered that £40 was missing.

O'Hara, of Thornaby, North Yorkshire claimed to police that Mr Murray had asked her to take the money to buy gifts for his twin baby great-grandchildren and that he suffered with memory problems.

But in his statements, Mr Murray, who died on July 1, two days after his 80th birthday, said: 'I'm 79 years old. I get £30 a week wages, which is kept in my wallet in the safe in my room.

'I did not give Claire permission to take money.

'I'm very upset and disturbed as I thought she was a lovely lass. I'm finding it hard to describe how I'm feeling.

'The fact that someone who I liked could do this has made me feel traumatised.'

O'Hara, who had worked at the home for eight years, repeated her claims that she had been told to take the money at her trial.

Magistrates found O'Hara guilty of theft and adjourned sentence for reports. She was given unconditional bail.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton said: 'He came to the care home after my mum Joan died - they were married for 58 years so that hit him hard and he was in a bad way.

'But he really picked up with the care he got and came through it. We have to say, we don't want people to tar the whole care home with the same brush. The care he received - even from Claire - was perfection.

'All these young girls looking after him, he was in his element. he liked it there.

'We chose Stainton Way because it appeared to be - and was proven to be - the best. I looked at a lot of homes.

Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton and son Michael Murray said he was never the same after the theft

'This theft occurred on the first anniversary of my mum's death - and Claire was well aware of the significance of that date.'

She said Mr Murray, who was also father to sons Michael and Antony and had nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, was a 'sociable chap' with a good sense of humour, but that he was 'never the same after this happened'.

She added: 'I thought it was despicable how they tried to suggest he had forgotten he'd asked her to take the money.

'We're just glad justice has been done for dad - it doesn't even really matter what the sentence is.'

Mr Murray's son Michael added: 'He was such a kind person. Even after everything, he started to worry about Claire - about how her family would cope if she went to jail.'
