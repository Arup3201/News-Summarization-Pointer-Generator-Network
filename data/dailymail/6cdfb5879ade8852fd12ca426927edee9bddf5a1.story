The famous artist Thomas Kinkade's signature has been appearing on new paintings, despite his death last year.

That's because a group of artists who studied under his tutelage are producing paintings which so closely resemble Kinkade's technique that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart from his original work - except that the new paintings are stamped with the word 'studios' beneath his famous signature.

Thomas Kinkade Studios 'continues in the path that Thom himself started and developed,' according to the company's website.

A group of artists who studied under Kinkade's tutelage are producing paintings which so closely resemble his technique that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart. This painting is by Kinkade

This was painted by the Thomas Kinkade Studios. Since Kinkade's death in April 2012, the artist's company has continued to release works bearing his trademarked signature, with one small addition: the word 'studios.'

Rather than reproducing  Kinkade's art, these 'Kinkadian' artists are actually creating new scenes that Kincade never painted by employing his brush and color techniques and focusing, just as he did, on artificial and natural light.

'Thomas Kinkade Studios carries on the Kinkadian tradition to create art that will stand the test of time and be treasured for the ages,' according to the website.

Kinkade died in April of 2012 at the age of 54 from a drug and alcohol overdose. Following his death, his widow Nanette Kinkade and girlfriend Amy Pinto fought over the artist's $66 million estate.

Kinkade, who had four daughters, started dating Pinto six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded.

Pinto claimed Kinkade wrote 
two notes bequeathing her his mansion and $10 million to establish a 
museum of his paintings.

The
 barely legible note read: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being of sound mind and 
body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto $10,000,000 in cash from my 
corporate policy.’

He also 
wrote that Pinto should have his two properties on Ridgecrest Avenue 
‘for her security'. It is signed and dated November 18, 2011.

Nanette Kinkade disputed those claims and sought full control of the estate.

Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, took her late husband's girlfriend to court to keep her from getting a share of Kinkade's estate

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives

The women came to a settlement in December, the details of which were not disclosed.

Kinkade, the self-described 'Painter of Light,' was known for sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes.

His
 work led to a commercial empire of franchised galleries, reproduced 
artwork and spin-off products that was said to fetch some $100 million 
each year in sales.

It is estimated that one in every 20 homes in American contains a piece an artwork by the 'Painter of Light.'

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)
