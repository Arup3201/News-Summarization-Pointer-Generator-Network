U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to return to work next week, almost three weeks after being sidelined by a concussion.

Her spokesman Philippe Reines says Clinton, 65, continues to recuperate at home and will resume her office schedule next week.

He says Clinton had no schedule this week because of a long-planned holiday.

Back to work: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham the office work next week, almost three weeks after being sidelined by a concussion

Aides and doctors say Clinton contracted a stomach virus in early December and became dehydrated, then fainted, fell and hit her head.

She was diagnosed with a concussion on December 13 and hasn't been seen in public since.

Clinton's illness led her to cancel an overseas trip and scheduled testimony before Congress about the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suffered her concussion after a fainting fit on the morning of Saturday, December 9, and has been recovering at home since.

The State Department says Clinton was dehydrated because of the virus and 
that she fainted, causing the concussion.

Clinton was unable to testify as scheduled at 
the December 13 congressional hearings into the September 11 attack against a 
U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, 
including the U.S. ambassador.

'Secretary Clinton's team contacted Senator [John] Kerry this morning
to inform them of the Secretary's concussion,' Jodi Seth, a Kerry 
spokesperson, said Saturday, December 15.

'Senator Kerry was relieved to hear that 
the Secretary is on the mend, but he insisted that given her condition, 
she could not and should not appear on Thursday
as previously planned, and that the nation's best interests are served 
by the report and hearings proceeding as scheduled with senior officials
appearing in her place.'

Clinton also pulled out of a week-long trip to North Africa and the Middle East because of the stomach virus that caused her to faint.

'Stamina:' At 67 years old, Clinton bragged to Barbara Walters just days before fainting that she is healthy and has plenty of energy and stamina

Only days before her concussion Clinton had said she was in excellent health during an interview with Barbara Walters.

At 65, detractors have claimed Clinton's advancing age and health make her too old to realistically serve as a two-term president were she elected in 2016.

'I am, thankfully, knock on wood, not only healthy, but have incredible stamina and energy,' Clinton told Barbara Walters.

Clinton has a history of fainting, having experienced a brief spell in in 2005 during an appearance before a women's group in Buffalo.

The former first lady is expected to step down from her role as Secretary of State in the beginning of 2013 when President Obama begins his second term.

At a State Department press conference in January 2012, she announced that she would be stepping down from the 'high wire of American politics' after 20 years as first lady, a senator from New York, and finally U.S. Secretary of State.

She told reporters at the press conference that 'it would be a good idea to find out how tired I really am.'
