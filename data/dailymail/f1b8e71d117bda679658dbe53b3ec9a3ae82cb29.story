A cancer sufferer achieved her dream of playing in her first college basketball game on Sunday, scoring the first points of the match.

Mount St Joseph freshman Lauren Hill, 19, was diagnosed last year with an inoperable brain tumor and was told she had years to live.

In September, doctors had a grim update - she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy.

Powering through: The NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to play its first game of the season against Hiram College two weeks earlier

But the NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to start its season two weeks earlier, and the team tipped off against Hiram College with Hill on the court.

NBC Sports reports that Mount St Joseph's had trouble with the practice drills for the first play they were planning for the game. 

When they finally ran it for real, it all ran smoothly, with Hill finishing under the basket where sank a layup to put Mount St Joseph on the board.

Hill is the last person trying to focus on her condition, though, saying to an interviewer, 'Let’s not call it my last game. This is my first collegiate game.'  

She was awarded the USBWA Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award at halftime as Summitt, the coach with the most ever wins in NCAA basketball, stood by her.

'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' Hill told Local 12 before the game.

Struggle: Hill was a standout player and former prom queen in high school, but has not let her terminal condition depress her

Hill learned she would secure a chance to play on October 1 during a surprise birthday party, the school informed her they'd gotten the NCAA waiver.

'I love the roar of the crowd, the squeaking of the shoes. I can't wait to be on this court and wearing #22,' she said then.

Since her new prognosis, she's been trying to raise awareness for her terminal condition, Diffused Intrinsic Pentene Gleoma, starting a campaign called #Layup4Lauren.

In a layup challenge on the site, a person is asked to spin around and try a layup with their non-dominant hand to simulate the struggle of playing with a condition like the one Hill has. 

So far, teams like Mount St Joseph and Xavier and people like Garth Brooks and Nick Lachey have recorded their challenge videos.

'She's a special person, Mount St Joseph coach, Dan Benjamin, said. 'This girl is so strong, she's dealing with death and all she's thinking about is everyone else.
