Al and Betty Perry celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary this week. But neither one of them would have lived to see it, if a quick-thinking police officer hadn't come to their aid.

The couple were driving down the highway near Tofield in Alberta, Canada, Saturday, when - from out of nowhere - a bolt of lightning struck their truck.

Video from the incredible moment was captured on a surveillance camera from a nearby warehouse and broadcast by CTV News.

The cab instantly filled with smoke as the electronics in the truck went haywire. The locked stopped working, the airbags deployed and Mr and Mrs Perry couldn't open the door.

This is the heart-stopping moment that Al and Betty Perry were hit by a lightning bolt as they drove down the highway in Alberta, Canada. Their truck was instantly engulfed in flames

The lightning strike was captured by the surveillance camera on a nearby factory. The cab filled with smoke and all the electronics were fried

'It’s an awful feeling to have,' Mr Perry told CTV. 'I saw our lives passing before my eyes..

'It sounded like a sonic boom,' he added.

'I turned my body and put my two feet up
 and tried to kick the window out. I don’t know how many 
times I tried.'

In the footage, the couple's car is seen driving along a road next to power lines and under stormy skies.

Lightning suddenly strikes the truck, and a halo of flames can be seen engulfing the vehicle as it continues down the road.

Mr Perry said he feared their truck would become a 'coffin' and added that he was concerned for his wife because she was recovering from a stroke.

Shocking: The truck began to light on fire around Mr and Mrs Perry and the cab filled with smoke

Impact: Potholes mark the road surface at the points where the lightning made contact

Lucky escape: Al and Betty Perry thought they would be overcome by smoke after their truck was hit

Fortunately, a police officer who had been driving behind them was able to break into the vehicle and help the couple to safety.

While the couple, who celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary just days after the strike, were given a clean bill of health by doctors, their truck didn't fare so well.

All of the air bags inside it had gone off, and the strike and flames had melted sections of the vehicle.

Two deep potholes also mark the road at the point where the lightning made contact.
