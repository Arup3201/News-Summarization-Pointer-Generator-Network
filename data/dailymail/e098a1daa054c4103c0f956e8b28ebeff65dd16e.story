George Zimmerman's wife is reaping more than $4,000-a-month from his defence fund despite splitting from him four weeks after he was cleared of murdering Trayvon Martin.

Shellie Zimmerman filed to legally end her marriage two days after breaking her silence during a television interview where she explained that her self-esteem had been 'beaten down' by her husband and his trial put a strain on their marriage.

And today TMZ revealed she is collecting the $4,300 stipend to cover her 'living expenses' even though the couple separated on August 13.

Zimmerman had raised some $300,000 to be used for his 'ongoing living expenses, legal costs, and fees for this matter', according to the solicitation on PayPal.

More confusing still, his legal 
defense website says: 'Currently George and Shellie are renting a secure
residence at a reasonable rate.  Their day-to-day living expenses are 
relatively modest as they want to preserve as many funds as possible for
an aggressive defense.'

It comes as Shellie's lawyer confirmed their split to The Orlando Sentinel on
Thursday and said that while the formal filing is imminent, the couple 
separated on August 13- exactly one month after he was acquitted of the 
teen's murder.

Shellie,
who told the court that she was two months shy of earning her 
registered nurse's license before dropping out of school, has no income 
and six-figure debts.

According to the paper, she has $103,756 in debt due to school and car loans as well as credit card bills.

She wants to have a mediator divide up the couple's assets equitably but she hopes to gain custody of their two dogs- a Rottweiller named Oso and a mixed breed named Leroy.

Her $12,729 in assets is attributed largely to her Honda Accord.

'After much soul searching and recent disappointments, Shellie feels compelled to officially end her six-year marriage to George Michael Zimmerman,' Kelly Sims said.

'The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,' the filing wrote.

Her brother-in-law Robert, who frequently made press appearances during the trial, said that Shellie has not yet filed the divorce papers but her legal team confirmed to him that they will be processed soon.

'According to Shellie's atty Kelly 
Sims - Shellie is preparing to file 4 divorce. Docs have not yet been 
filed in Seminole Cty. Pray 4 them,' Robert Zimmerman wrote on Twitter.

Shellie,
26, spoke to Good Morning America and told how the death threats that 
he husband received following Trayvon Martin's slaying came at a cost 
for their quality of life, forcing them to live 'pretty much Gypsies for
the past year'.

We lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone would find us and it would be horrific,' she said in the interview which aired on August 28.

Mrs Zimmerman stood by her husband throughout his lengthy criminal trial that sent them both into hiding when George became a symbol of racial tension.

She appeared at every court hearing for him before he was acquitted of second degree murder.  

Even now, she stands by his actions that night, when the neighborhood watch volunteer confronted a teenager he thought looked suspicious who was walking through his neighborhood.

When asked if she thought George had targeted Trayvon and murdered him in cold blood, she he's 'not capable' that kind of behavior.

'That's not his way,' she said.

With the exception of his latest speeding ticket, George Zimmerman's legal worries are currently over.

The same is not true for Shellie, however, as she appeared in court in late August to enter a guilty plea to lying under oath.

She
admitted that she lied when asked about she and George's financial 
situation when he was trying to meet bail after being arrested for the 
shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

'By
lying under oath, I let my God down, I let your Honor and the court 
down, I let my family and friends down, and, most of all, I let myself 
down,' she wrote in an apology letter.

She received 100 hours of community service and a year of probation, which she plans to fulfill with community service at a Christian ministry.
