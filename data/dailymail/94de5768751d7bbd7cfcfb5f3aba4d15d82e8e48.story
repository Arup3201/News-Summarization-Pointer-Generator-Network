After months of rumours, Facebook has officially launched its Facebook at Work pilot.

Designed to be used as self-contained social network within companies, the site has begun rolling out apps to a select number of 'partner' firms. 

Facebook at Work is available on the web, Android and iOS and the Californian tech giant described it as 'a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools.'

Facebook at Work is currently a pilot and is only available on the web, Android and iOS to a select number of 'partner' firms. The Californian tech giant described it as 'a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools'

Reports claim that the site features a News Feed, Groups, Messages and Events, like the original social network.

Privacy wise, Facebook at Work will only be accessible by people within a company.

And the tech giant said an employee’s Facebook at Work information is 'safe, secure, confidential and completely separate from their personal profile.'

Facebook confirmed yesterday that it will start placing clickable warnings over extreme 'graphic' content on its site.

The warnings, which are placed over flagged images and videos, state that the content might 'shock offend and upset'.

The move comes after the Californian social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images.

The warning asks the user 'are you sure you want to see this?'.

Content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items.

Videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of French policeman, Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in Paris during the Charlie Hebdo attacks. 

When the rumours first originated in November, sources said the site would likely launch without adverts. 

However, this may mean Facebook charges companies to use the app as an alternative way to make money. 

By launching an enterprise version of the site, Facebook is also taking aim at LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft's Yammer. 

Facebook staff were said to have been given a beta version of the ad-free Facebook at Work to test in December. 

A study last year found that more than 54 per cent of offices currently block Facebook on work computers to stop it distracting users. 

In October, Facebook  reported its quarterly profit nearly doubled to £511 million ($802 million), but saw its stock hit hard after outlining a plan to invest heavily in the future instead of using its short-term riches.

'We are going to continue preparing for the future by investing aggressively, connecting everyone, understanding the world, and building the next-generation in computing platforms,' said boss Mark Zuckerberg at the time.

'We have a long journey ahead.' 

The 10-year-old site currently has 1.35 billion monthly active users worldwide, while LinkedIn has more than 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories. 

When the rumours first originated in November, sources said the site would likely launch without adverts. However, this may mean Facebook charges companies to use the app as an alternative way to make money. By launching an enterprise version of the site, Facebook is taking aim at professional network LinkedIn

According to the professional site, users sign up to join LinkedIn at a rate of more than two new members per second.

The site lets professionals 'connect' with each other to form networks. It also has its own messaging service and news feed. 

But Nicholas Scholz, global product manager, collaboration, at software firm Novell isn't convinced: 'We already know enough about Facebook that we can start making conclusions as to where this will end.

Facebook has been looking to expand its services for year. 

Recently, it unveiled an app called Room that lets people chat anonymously in virtual 'rooms,' evoking the chat services from the early days of the web.

It is also testing a feature that lets users of the leading social network make purchases by simply pressing an on-screen 'Buy' button.

Meanwhile, Facebook completed its multibillion-dollar deal for mobile messaging application WhatsApp last year.

And in November, it revamped its privacy policy to make it easier to understand, after years of criticism. 

It has also introduced tools to help people manage what they share on the site.

The site's security was heightened at the end of last year when it rolled out default encryption, too.  

'This is the same site where members share everything and anything with Friends. 

'People of all ages leave privacy at the door when they sign-in to Facebook. 

'You can essentially equate Facebook to the party guy you want to hang out with on Friday night who's funny, popular and a bit crazy - but would you want to work with him?

'It seems Facebook is not just looking to build another social network to compete with the likes of LinkedIn.

'Instead, it is planning to offer enterprise collaboration. 

'Keeping the workplace IT environment safe and secure is a huge priority for IT departments. With this in mind, it's unlikely that Facebook will be able to stop IT from feeling comfortable with the safety of their information.'
