A hugely expensive and controversial wind farm was given the government’s go-ahead yesterday, building a permanent ‘blight on the countryside’, campaigners said.

The £365million project, the biggest ever in England and Wales, will involve erecting 76 turbines - each of which will stand 475ft tall.

Countryside lovers, who have been fighting the proposal for almost two decades, said the farm would be ‘ugly’ and ruin the local landscape of hills and valleys.

The beautiful South Wales countryside which campaigners fear could be ruined by plans to build a wind farm

But despite their petitions and appeals, they lost their struggle when permission was granted to build what will be among the highest turbines in Europe across 155 acres of countryside.

Each taller than the London Eye (443ft), it is claimed they will be able to produce enough energy to supply 206,000 homes.

But to those opposed to the Pen-y-Cymoedd development in South Wales, say that electricity will come at far too high a price for the area.

A spokesperson for the Glyncorrwg Action Group, named after an affected village, said: ‘Wind farms are ugly, inefficient and will spoil the wild beautiful areas around the village.

‘Our fight against the wind farm developers is one of David against Goliath, big business against small vulnerable communities.

‘Measures should be introduced to prevent the free for all by developers, that is taking place in areas such as Glyncorrwg.’

He continued: ‘This ugly, industrial 
wind farm development is totally unfair and it would ruin our landscape 
and our hopes to develop tourism.

‘This proposal will be detrimental to our future, short-term gain will lead to long term losses of our beautiful landscape.’

The development on rural land between the Welsh towns of Neath and Aberdare, was given the backing of the energy ministry.

The wind farm is being built by Swedish company Vattenfall is likely to cost around £300 million, with construction starting as early as next year.

Despite vocal objections local councils chose not to block to the scheme.

Former Welsh Assembly Member Dr Brian Gibbons, who has seen the detailed plans, said the move forward was a ‘disappointment’.

He added: ‘It is too big and far too intrusive to our local communities.’ 

The site of the farm is owned by the 
Forestry Commission Wales, which has worked with the company on the 
proposal, and is backed by the Welsh wing of the RSPB, whose director 
commented: ‘RSPB Cymru welcomes the positive approach Vattenfall has 
taken to nature conservation through the Pen y Cymoedd wind farm - an 
approach which will result in a net gain for wildlife in this area.’

Wind turbines are being switched off in Scotland because of fears for children's safety.

Up to 16 turbines at school sites in The Scottish Highlands are affected by the move, in what is being described as a 'precautionary measure' by council bosses.

The machines are being turned off following concerns raised by Highland councillors and residents earlier this year.

The building of two new turbines in Scotland have also been postponed.

SNP’s Inverness Central member Donnie Kerr, voiced concerns about their safety and refused to back their construction due to a lack of exclusion zone in either scheme.

Despite the turbine shutdown, however, Steve Barron, Highland council’s deputy chief executive has vowed to continue to press on with renewable energy schemes.

She
added: ‘We hope that other companies will adopt a similar attitude and 
that that this project will set the gold standard for wind farm 
developments in Wales and, indeed, elsewhere.’

Vattenfall
has pledged a benefits package to the community said to be worth £55 
million, including £3 million for habitat management and £6,000 a year 
for each megawatt of electricity paid into a community fund.

Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: ‘Onshore wind plays an important role in enhancing our energy security.‘It is the cheapest form of renewable electricity and reduces our reliance on foreign fuel.

‘This
project in South Wales will generate vast amounts of home-grown 
renewable electricity and provide a significant benefits package for the
local community.’

The green light for the project comes
after the Government released a joint report with industry body 
RenewableUK highlighting the benefits to the economy of onshore wind, 
including for local communities.

Vattenfall
said it would cost around £300 million to build the wind farm, creating
or supporting around 300 jobs in Wales, and once a final investment 
decision has been taken construction could start next year with the 
first electricity generated in 2016.

Piers Guy, Vattenfall’s head of onshore wind development in the UK, said: ‘Pen y Cymoedd is a major project that could be worth more than £1 billion to the UK economy.

‘We have consistently stated our commitment to making sure that we maximise the value of Pen y Cymoedd to the region and to Wales. This is now our priority.’

Campaigners are angry about the proposed wind farm project, which could look similar to these turbines erected in Lincolnshire (pictured)

Last month plans to build the world’s largest wind farm at one of Britain’s top tourist attractions are facing new opposition after protestors mocked up a video showing how the giant turbines will ‘blight’ the heavily-protected Jurassic Coast.

The £3 billion farm will be visible to the millions of tourists who visit the Dorset and Isle of Wight coast every year - and tourism chiefs fear it will drive visitors away from the area, currently England’s only natural World Heritage site.

It also emerged that the Royal Family could soon be cashing in on dozens of wind turbines - even though they have been condemned by Prince Charles and Prince Philip.

Energy firms have been given the green light for 45 windmills on Crown Estate land, which will rake in £1million a year in subsidies.

Homeowners living next door to the prospective wind farms in Wales and Lincolnshire accused the Royal Family of hypocrisy, after the Prince of Wales described them as a ‘horrendous blot on the landscape’ while his father called them ‘useless’ and ‘a disgrace’.
