A waitress got a tremendous tip and a lovely letter from a man who ordered a meal of hot dogs in honor of his dead brother's birthday on March 8 as part of a yearly ritual. 

The man, who was seemingly eating at Mac's Grub Shak in Spring Hill, Tennessee, ordered hot dogs at the restaurant because they were his brother's favorite meal.

After he finished the symbolic franks, the man left his waitress a $36 tip because that is how old his brother Wes would have turned on Wednesday.

In addition to Coney Island Dogs, the man ordered two beers and a spicy Dragon's Breath burger at Mac's

In addition to the tip, the man left a note on the receipt.

The server posted a picture of it online with the caption: 'This guy sat in my section tonight & left a note on the back of his receipt.'

The note read: 'Today is my brother's b-day. He would have been 36 today. 

'Every year I go eat his favorite meal (hot dogs) and tip the waitress his age. 

'Happy B-Day Wes.'

According to an enhanced version of the picture, the man also ordered two beers and a spicy burger to accompany his special Coney Island Dogs.

In addition to the two pork and beef dogs, which came topped with diced onions, chili, and mustard, the man had a Goose Island IPA, a Country Boy beer and a Dragon's Breath burger.

The Dragon's Breath is a half pound of premium Black Angus beef, seasoned with a special spicy blend.

It comes topped with Jack cheese, crispy fried jalapenos, Sriracha mayo, and applewood smoked bacon.

His bill came to $29.40, including tax. 

Mac's is operated by a father and son team who also own a catering company. 

Michael McCray, the son, told Daily Mail Online that he lost his brother as well and that his birthday is coming up soon. 

He said: 'The server the tip was written to has worked for me for several months. 

'On Sunday afternoon she came to my office crying and of course I was taken by surprise.

'I asked her what was wrong and she just put the receipt in my hand.

'I read it and broke down.

'What none of my employees know is that I too lost my brother.

'In just a few weeks he would have been 28. 

'It's odd that this man would choose my restaurant over any other place.'  

After a picture of the note was published on Reddit, one of the first commenters wrote: 'Happy birthday Wes! 

'This was so absolutely heartwarming and made me smile that someone would do this. 

'It rekindles my hope for people as a whole.'

Another person simply added: 'Happy Birthday Wes!'
