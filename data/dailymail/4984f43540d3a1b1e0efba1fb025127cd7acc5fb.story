Three more major Tory donors were rewarded in the New Year honours list, it emerged yesterday, as the political row over the ‘devalued’ system intensified.

Doug Ellis, James Wates and James Lupton received a knighthood and two CBEs respectively, for charitable and philanthropic work. They have given £370,000 to the Tory Party between them.

The revelation put fresh pressure on David Cameron, already under attack after a knighthood went to another Tory donor, Paul Ruddock, and a CBE to property tycoon Gerald Ronson, who was jailed for his part in the Guinness share-trading scandal.

construction firm Wates, has given £175,000 to the 
Tories since 2001

Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister had played no role in deciding who received honours.

Government sources pointed out that 
two major Labour donors, Capita boss Rod Aldridge and the founder of 
online gambling firm bet365, Denise Coates, had also been honoured.

But Labour accused the PM of using the
honours to reward Tory donors.

Doug Ellis, former Chairman of Aston Villa Football Club, gave £90,000 to the Tories in the run-up to the last election

And Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of 
the committee on standards in public life, said that although the four 
Tory donors had been honoured for their contributions to society, their 
inclusion threatened to ‘devalue’ the honours system.

Mr Ellis, who made his fortune in the 
package holiday business, gave £90,000 to the Tories in the run-up to 
the last election. He was knighted for services to charity.

Investment banker Mr Lupton has given 
£105,000 to the Tories in recent years. A former trustee of the Dulwich 
Picture Gallery in South London, he was awarded a CBE for services to 
the arts.

Mr Wates is deputy chairman of the 
construction firm Wates. His companies have given some £175,000 to the 
Tories since 2001. He received a CBE for services to construction and 
charity.

Mr Ruddock, co-founder of the 
Lansdowne Partners hedge fund, has given £570,000 to the Tories. His 
firm is said to have made £100million by betting on the collapse of 
Northern Rock. Government sources pointed out that he was knighted for 
his philanthropic work.

He is one of 
the City's wealthiest men, with a fortune estimated at £280million.

Among his philanthropic work, he is chairman of the Victoria and Albert 
Museum, for which he has helped raise more than £120million.

Mr Graham
told the Sunday Times: 'It is most unfortunate if there is a public 
perception that there is a clear link between honours and political 
donations.

Controversial: Gerald Ronson,

Ruddock, right, is to be knighted

No decision to make: A Government source said that the Prime Minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours

'If it is going to become a routine right under this government I think there should be... a closer look at the system.'

Andrew George, a senior Liberal Democrat MP, said the Coalition Government needed to 'keep the whole thing squeaky clean'.

Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'David 
Cameron promised to clean up politics, but in office he has shown he is 
utterly out of touch with decent British people. He is giving a 
knighthood to Paul Ruddock, who made millions from the collapse of 
Northern Rock and has given over £500,000 to the Tories.

'This tells you everything you need to know about the Tories' 
priorities. When millions of families are struggling to get by, it's the
Tories' friends in the City who get the rewards.'
