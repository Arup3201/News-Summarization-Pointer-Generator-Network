Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is pushing ahead with the signing of Porto’s £20million midfielder, Fernando, as he devises a strategy to win the Champions League next season with just 21 players.

Pellegrini plans to base his next European campaign around the Brazilian — one of the best holding midfielders in the world — after accepting that the team need to tighten up following three successive Champions League failures.

City are determined that Friday’s punishment by UEFA for breaking Financial Fair Play rules, consisting of a heavy fine and squad restrictions, will not alter their ambitions for next season.

Top target: Manchester City are chasing Porto enforcer Fernando for a fee of £20m

Policy: The sanctions will not change which players Manuel Pellegrini decides to chase

Strong: Fernando's team-mate Eliaquim Mangala is another player on Manchester City's radar

But UEFA want City to include the full quota of eight home-grown players in their squad of 21 — cut from 25 — and a UEFA spokesman confirmed: ‘All clubs will have to abide by the regulations.’

UEFA’s stance will force City into difficult decisions over who to leave out, although a senior club source said: ‘There will be no change in transfer strategy.’ That means Fernando, Porto team-mate Eliaquim Mangala and Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna are still expected to sign this summer. 

Javi Garcia and Matija Nastasic may be sold to raise funds, while a number of English players, including World Cup-bound James Milner, are considering their futures because of a lack of first-team opportunities. Milner’s contract talks have stalled as he enters the final year of his current deal.

Fernando, 26, is regarded as a particularly important acquisition by Pellegrini, who privately acknowledged after the club’s Champions League exit to Barcelona last season that he might have to be more  cautious in big games to succeed against Europe’s elite.

Pellegrini’s plan is to use Fernando as a defensive midfield player, allowing Fernandinho and Yaya Toure to play ahead of him. That would mean City playing with just one striker in a 4-1-4-1 system for some European games, leaving Alvaro Negredo in danger of missing out altogether on City’s reduced Champions League squad. Despite a £1billion investment in City since 2008, the club’s Abu Dhabi owners have yet to see them reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, despite twice winning the  Premier League.

UEFA’s sanctions pose difficult problems as City plan for next season. In addition to the £49m fine — £33m of which is suspended —  and European squad restrictions, City must not increase their wage bill and cannot spend more than £49m net in this transfer window.

Whatever questions are thrown at City, however, Pellegrini believes Fernando is the answer because of his willingness to help protect the defence at all times.

Leaving: Javi Garcia is another who may make way with city's reduced budget

Options: James Milner may leave in search of more first-team football

The 6ft 1in player has twice before been 
close to coming to the Premier League. Everton boss Roberto Martinez 
applied for and received a work permit for him on deadline day last 
summer only for the move to break down when Porto failed to sign a 
replacement. City then tried to sign Fernando in January in a double 
deal with Mangala but failed to agree a fee with their Portuguese club.

Fernando’s new contract has a £20m buy-out clause. However, his impending arrival will have a knock-on effect with City’s English players growing increasingly disenchanted about their lack of game time.

City need eight home-grown players if they name the full allocation of 25 allowed for their Premier League squad.

Wanted: Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna is wanted by a number of clubs, including City

Gone: Joleon Lescott will definitely leave after his contract expired

They have already lost Joleon Lescott, whose contract has run out, and Milner is in no hurry to negotiate his new deal. The 28-year-old was disappointed to be left out of their team for the Capital One Cup final and the final Premier League game of the season against West Ham, when they clinched the title.

City would love Milner to stay because of his versatility — a stance that will surely only harden following UEFA’s ruling — and the lack of top English players good enough for their squad.

If Milner refuses to renew his deal, they could either sell him this summer or hold him to the final year to make up their home-grown quota but lose him for nothing in 12 months’ time.

Sidelined: Micah Richards is interesting Liverpool and has just 12 months left on his current deal

Desperate: Jack Rodwell (right) might also leave as he barely played last season despite being fit

Defender Micah Richards, who interests Liverpool, is in a similar position. Richards has 12 months left on his contract but will not sign a new one having spent most of last season on the sidelines.

Midfielder Jack Rodwell, 23, is also desperate for games. He was hardly used by Pellegrini despite being fit for virtually the entire campaign and missed any chance of being in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad as a result. Milner, Richards and Rodwell had only 15 Premier League starts between them last season — 12 of those by Milner. 

Spanish midfielder Garcia will be allowed to leave as City are not  permitted more than 17 overseas  players aged over 21 in their Premier League squad.
