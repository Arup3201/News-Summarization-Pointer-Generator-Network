A two-year-old girl has been scarred for life after she fell face-first on to a barbecue left in a park which became stuck to her skin.

Luii Duncan suffered serious burns and is likely to need a skin graft following the horrific accident in Beddington Park, in Sutton, south London.

The toddler was among a group of children playing near to the metal barbecue when she fell on to the red hot coals.

Accident: Luii Duncan, 2, suffered serious injuries after she fell on to a barbecue which had been left in a park

Injuries: Luii received burns to her face, arms, chest and hands following the horrific accident in Beddington Park, Sutton

The child's parents and their friends managed to pull the barbecue off Luii, after it became stuck to her stomach, by dousing her with water.

She received burns to her face, arms chest and hands.

The barbecue had been left smouldering despite the owners reportedly being asked by friends of Luii's parents to put it out before they left.

She was taken by ambulance to St Helier Hospital, Sutton, following the incident at about 5pm on Sunday, before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at Chelsea Children’s Hospital.

Her mother, Rosemary Duncan, from Morden, said she cannot get the image of the barbecue being stuck to her youngster’s stomach out of her head.

She said: 'I’m trying to block it out, but I want to warn people about the dangers of leaving hot barbecues in parks.

'It’s horrifying to see a man holding up your child and seeing her with a barbecue stuck on her stomach. Everyone was throwing water on her and trying to pull it off.'

Action: Luii's mother Rosemary Duncan has said more needed to be done to stop such accidents

The child remained under observation in hospital until Tuesday when she was able to return home.

Mrs Duncan said: 'It’s a long journey to recovery for her, We’re just thankful she is going to be OK.

'She will have a scar for life on her stomach, and burns on her arms. She is still having trouble sleeping.'

Self-employed Mrs Duncan said more needed to be done to stop such accidents.

She said: 'There need to be more wardens around to enforce the rules. Next time a young child might be killed.'

Luii’s father, Nathan Duncan, said: 'Our daughter has been subjected to untold agony and trauma due to negligence, inconsideration and a deep lack of care for others.

'These individuals’ enjoyment and entertainment was far more important to them than the health and safety of those around them.'

Council by-laws state it is illegal to have a barbecue in Sutton’s parks, but police have said after investigating the issue there were no criminal charges to answer.

But police have said they will increase patrols in parks by PCSOs while the hot weather continues.

A council spokesman said: 'We are sorry this unfortunate incident occurred and we wish the little girl a speedy recovery.

'Sutton is proud of its parks and open spaces and we do all we can to make sure they are safe for residents to enjoy.

'We would like to draw attention to the park by-laws which forbid anyone from lighting a fire for a barbecue or any other reason unless it is in a designated area on one of the stands provided.

'In this incident the barbecue was not on a stand.'

Request: The owners of the barbecue had reportedly been asked to put it out before leaving (file picture)
