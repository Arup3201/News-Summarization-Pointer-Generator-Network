Since coming clean a year ago, Jess has made her story public and become and ambassador for charity Febfast to inspire others to stop taking drugs

When she was only 17-years-old, Jess woke up in a squatters' drug-house to find that she had no memory of the last five months.

The teenager from Melbourne's inner west had been smoking ice every day for so long that she had lost complete track of time and believed her mobile phone, which displayed the date, was faulty.

'With ice, your sense of time disappears when you smoke and you think it has been five minutes but it has been five hours. Because I was smoking every day, my sense of time was completely gone,' Jess, now 20-years-old, told Daily Mail Australia.

'I thought it was still May, but when I turned on my phone it said it was October. It sent me into a nervous breakdown - I couldn't believe it, I thought the phone was faulty, then I thought it was lying to me. 

'It was a turning point for me because I realised how dominant the ice was; I had no memory of that five month period, it was taking my life away. It sunk in that night that I had to make a change.' 

Now, three years later, Jess has made her story public and become an ambassador for Febfast, a charity for youths with addictions, in an effort to inspire others to turn their life around.

Since joining the group, she's been contacted by dozens of people thanking her for sharing her story, including a grandmother supporting her addicted grandson who told Jess she was moved by her brave recovery.

For Jess, the start of her addiction is a story that has been heard before; at 16 she became involved with the wrong crowd at a new high school and found herself experimenting with drugs when things began to escalate.

Now 20-years-old, the former addict from Melbourne's inner west, started smoking crystal meth at 16

'I started by smoking cannabis and progressed from there and got offered to smoke ice,' Jess said.

'I had no knowledge of ice and as soon as I had my first smoke, I was addicted. It was too good not to continue to use.'

'It's crazy how quickly it spirals out of control. Within the first month, I quit my job, stopped going to school and ran away from home.'

She remembers one of the biggest turning points in her life as being the day she gave up her safe, clean and loving family home to live in 'one of the biggest drug houses in the suburbs'.

'When I was in high school I'd always be stoned and one day she [Jess' mum] picked me up from school and I was all over the place after smoking ice. She asked me what was wrong and I told her that I was high on ice because you don't have a filter on things when you smoke, you can't keep secrets,' Jess said.

Her turning point came when she realised she had no memory of a five month long period in which she had been smoking every day

'We realised it had escalated out of control, but I just said that this was going to be something I was doing.

'It's crazy how quickly it spirals out of control. Within the first month, I quit my job, stopped going to school and ran away from home,' Jess said of her first month of smoking ice

'She cried, she was very upset and she just wished me well but told me I had to leave because she didn't want me doing drugs in her house, so I did. 

'It just goes to show how much of a hold ice can have over you: I was willing to trade everything in for a squatting house with no running water or toilet. When you use ice you'll do anything just to have it in your life every day.'

While she can't recall how long she spent in the drug-house, Jess recalled that a lot of professionals would visit the property for crystal methamphetamines.

'There were professional workers coming to score with you – it was a place where you bought stuff but you could stay there… everybody knew that house,' she said.

Coming clean was not easy for the teenager, who took on a detox program on two separate occasions and fell back into old habits before a third two-year long program by the Youth Support + Advocacy Service finally helped her lead a normal drug-free life and rekindle her relationship with her mother. 

'The physical comedown is like nothing you can imagine, which is another reason I was addicted, I was constantly avoiding the comedown so I would constantly smoke,' she said.

'It feels like you've slipped into a massive depression. Physically you were sweating, you can't eat, mentally you're so tired but your body won't let you sleep. Paranoia is a massive side effect; you think everyone is out to get you, your idea of reality is really skewed, you get really angry and aggressive.'

Despite the pain and the life events she said she has missed out on, Jess said she didn't entirely regret using drugs because of the way the experience has allowed her to help others

Despite the pain and the life events she said she has missed out on – including graduating and attending school formals, Jess said she didn't entirely regret using drugs because of the way the experience has allowed her to help others.

'I hope that by sharing my story, people using ice can feel inspired and take the opportunity to change their life as well. I want to encourage all Australians to raise money for the drug and alcohol services that assisted me because it's not something that you can get through yourself. 

'Detox and rehab costs a lot of money and we do need the support to have these services available for other people.'
