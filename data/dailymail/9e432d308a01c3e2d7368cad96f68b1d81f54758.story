Adarbioyo has represented Manchester City at under-18 and under-21 levels as well as Birmingham City's academy side.

After being released by City at the end of the 2012/13 season, he had a trial with Manchester United before spending the final few months of last season  with St Johnstone's under-20 side.

Crystal Palace have signed former Manchester City striker Fisayo Adarabioyo. The 19-year-old, who also had a spell with Birmingham City before spending time on trial with Manchester United, has signed a short term contract at Palace and will join their development squad.

Adarabioyo, who can play as a winger or striker, had been on trial at Palace for the past few weeks and scored on his debut for the U21s against Bristol City last month.
