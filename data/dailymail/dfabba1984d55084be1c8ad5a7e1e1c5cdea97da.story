North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has inspected aircraft from the Korean People's Army in the latest in a series of visits to air force units in recent weeks. 

Kim inspected the Korean People's Army's Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 447 - believed to be located in the central province of South Pyongan. 

The young leader took a tour of the unit's flight training room and watched airmen under training, according to the Korean Central News Agency.

Kim said after the tour that 'airmen should make it part of their life and habit to undergo training with the help of modern piloting training equipment while flying aircraft a lot.'

'It is necessary to intensify training in order to shed less blood in battle,' Kim also said, calling for the intensification of training on combat flight mission performance under the worst conditions.

The leader's latest visit to the air force may be aimed at stressing the country's war readiness amid ongoing tension with South Korea.

Among those who accompanied the young leader to the air force unit are Hwang Pyong-so, the director of the General Political Bureau of the military as well as Ryom Chol-song, a vice propaganda director of the same bureau.

This week photographs of the dictator emerged stepping out onto red carpet from his own version of 'Air Force One'. 

A photo, published in the official North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun, showed for the first time the luxury Russian IL-62 jetliner that carries Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju on official engagements around the secretive country.

At first glance, the aircraft bears some similarity to the U.S. President's personal jet.

It has North Korea's official name and flag as well as a star symbolising Kim on its tail, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported quoting the North's paper.

The American President's jet is a prominent symbol of the presidency and its power - and it now appears that Kim has decided not to be out-done, ensuring the North's flag and his own seal mirrors the livery of Air Force One.

The South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train.

He has even tried his hand at the controls, it was claimed, although he is not known to have an qualifications as a pilot.
