A young couple who are still recovering from the devastating injuries they suffered in the Boston Marathon bombings have gotten engaged.

Pete DiMartino, 28, proposed to Rebekah Gregory, 26, on Friday by kneeling beside her wheelchair at her home in Richmond, Texas and presenting her with a ring he had custom-made following the April 15 attack. She said yes.

'I said, "You're my best friend and I 
love you",' he told NBC News. 'I couldn't get anything else out, I was shaking.'

The couple, who met on a work trip, have been together for a year and said they knew before the attacks that they had found the perfect match - but agreed the experience brought them even closer.

Celebration: Pete DiMartino, 28, and Rebekah Gregory, 26, are engaged - six months after they both suffered serious injuries in the Boston Marathon bombings. Rebekah is still unable to use one of her legs

Support: They are pictured before DiMartino threw out the first pitch before a Red Sox game in May

They were near the marathon finish line with Gregory's six-year-old son Noah when the two homemade bombs exploded in April, killing three and injuring more than 270.

Noah suffered injuries to his lungs and scrapes and bruises, but DiMartino and Gregory both required multiple surgeries and both continue to undergo rehabilitation.

As well as a ruptured eardrum, DiMartino lost 90 per cent of his right Achilles' tendon and suffered broken bones in his ankles and it has taken him months of physical therapy to learn to walk again.

Gregory has had a staggering 14 surgeries on her left leg, which she cannot put weight on and which she continues to fight to keep. Amputation is still an option if there is no luck with a new device that was drilled into the bone and which will hopefully turn the foot so she can walk on it again.

Together: The couple, who have been together a year, were standing near the finish line when the bombs exploded on April 15. Rebekah has undergone 14 surgeries since and could still lose her left leg

She has undergone skin grafts along her leg to cover where she lost soft tissue. Shrapnel marks also cover her leg.

'Going through an experience like the 
marathon makes you realize how short life really is and how we don't 
really know how much time we have left,' Gregory said.

'And I know that with my time 
there is nobody else I would want to spend it with. It made me 
realize how much I cared about him and how much he was the only person 
for me.'

DiMartino said watching his girlfriend fight through the multiple surgeries was inspiring and he joked that he 'had to jump on it before somebody else did'.

Strong: The couple are pictured with Gregory's son before the blats on the day of the bombings. The six-year-old boy only suffered scrapes and bruises but the couple has needed multiple surgeries

The couple are now building a home in Richmond, and DiMartino will move there from his home in Rochester, New York. They have designed the house, which includes a master bedroom on the ground floor to make it easier for Gregory.

DiMartino is even working towards taking part in an upcoming 5K race.

They hope to marry within a year but said that they have had so much stress in recent months that they don't plan on having a large event.

'We're marrying each other, that's all that matters,' Gregory said.
