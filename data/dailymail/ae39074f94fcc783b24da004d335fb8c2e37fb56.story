Temperatures might be below freezing, but these monkeys are still finding a way to stay warm this winter.

They soak themselves in a natural hot spring to relax and take a break from the cold weather in Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan's most northern island prefecture.

The Yunokawa Hot Springs area is home to about 100 free-range Japanese macaques, or snow monkeys.

Too much monkeying around: The snow monkeys soak themselves in a natural hot spring to relax in Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan's most northern island prefecture

Though the macaques can be seen year-round, tourists flock to the area  during colder months.

The animals warm themselves in the steaming mineral water mainly between December and May.

The bath's temperature averages around 40C, according to The Asahi Shimbun. 

Some monkeys spend their entire day in the hot spring when weather gets too cold - which might be quite regularly, seeing as Hakodate's average January temperature is minus 7C.

The Japanese macaques are highly intelligent creatures and live in very complex social groups, often fighting over the best spots in the springs.

Known for their dexterity, they have been spotted making and throwing snowballs to entertain themselves, much like humans do. 

Japan has a number of monkey parks that tourists frequent. 

The Jigokudani Kogen National Park in Nagano is also famed for its snow monkeys that bathe in hot springs.

Meanwhile, Monkey Park Iwatayama  in Kyoto is home to more than 170 monkeys.
