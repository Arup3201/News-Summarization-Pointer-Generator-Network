X Factor supremo Simon Cowell is finalising a deal to rent his pregnant lover a luxury apartment as she works out her divorce, MailOnline can reveal today.

The 53-year-old star - who is standing by New York socialite Lauren Silverman and their child - will pay $20,000-a-month for the sprawling three-bed property in NYC.

The couple are also now discussing which of Cowell's many properties they will also share - as he already owns multi-million dollar homes in Beverly Hills and London.

Cowell and Lauren are officially a 
couple, according to friends, and the music mogul is keen that she 
finalises her divorce from property millionaire Andrew Silverman as 
quickly and peacefully as possible. Moving in together will mark the first building block for their future.

Home, sweet, home? Simon Cowell is believed to be setting up his pregnant lover Lauren Silverman in a luxury Manhattan condo

It was reported this week by the Mirror that Lauren will move into Cowell's $15million mansion on the Trousdale estate in Beverly Hills. Cowell has also spent years renovating his other $22 million Beverly Hills mansion and owns an $11.6 million house in West London's wealthy Holland Park.

A deal is nearly agreed on the rental property - which remains on the market. Lauren will need a New York base as it's likely she will share custody of her seven-year-old son Adam with her soon-to-be ex husband Andrew.

And Cowell can most certainly afford it as today Forbes magazine listed him as the highest-paid TV personality of the year - tied with Howard Stern.

He
is said to be worth $200 million and made $95 million in the past year 
alone - mainly due to his ownership stakes in The X Factor, now shown in
41 countries as well as the Got Talent format, which is the 
biggest-selling TV franchise in the world.

Lauren, 36, is said to be 10 weeks pregnant.

She
has been seen in the city this week after spending the weekend at her 
rented $4 million Hamptons home with her estranged husband.

The couple have been trying to come to terms over their divorce and custody arrangements.

Having
met Cowell in Barbados in 2007 alongside her husband, it is still 
unclear as to when Lauren embarked on an affair with him.

Friends: Andrew Silverman was said to be one of Cowell's good pals

In January, Lauren posted a cryptic message about soulmates to her Instagram page.Â 

The 36-year-old socialite uploaded an image with the words: 'Throughout life you will meet one person who is unlike any other.'

Along
with the image Lauren also added her own words to the message and 
commented: 'True friendship and true love are rare like diamonds. To be 
cherished and treasured and to be hold onto with all you've got. Be 
kind. Love with raw passion and with all your heart. And finally, strive
to learn and practice the act of forgiveness. X'

This
week, a source close to Lauren, told Us Weekly magazine: 'Lauren has 
loved Simon forever. And they started having an affair four years ago.'

The
source added that the couple were originally only hooking up 
sporadically but they are more serious now that Lauren is pregnant.

The insider added: 'Simon and Lauren are together. They talk 100 times a day.'

As soon as the news of the pregnancy 
broke last week, a friend told MailOnline that Lauren had said she is in
love with Cowell and wants to marry him.

And when asked about the baby, another 
pal said: 'Simon has given all his exes houses - so of course he's going
to be generous to his own child', adding that 'he has not even 
considered not looking after this baby.

Couple: Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman are now making plans to start a life together

'Anyone who knows him knows that he's generous to a fault. Lauren keeps saying that she just wants to be with him, she's so in love with him, they're very good together. She makes him relax and have fun.

'She's fun loving, she loves a party and a giggle. Simon's himself around her, she's been good for him. He's so happy.'

Cowell has yet to make any official comment on Lauren's pregnancy, telling People last week: 'There are a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here.'

He is now in Europe and will take to the seas around the South of France in the coming days.

Cryptic message: Lauren posted a picture to Instagram that talked about soul mates

Deep and meaningful? The socialite posted her own message underneath the quote on her Instagram page, which has since been deleted
