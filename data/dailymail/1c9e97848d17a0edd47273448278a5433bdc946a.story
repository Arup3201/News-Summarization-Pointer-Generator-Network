A tourist has captured footage of sand sharks circling a popular pier at South Carolina's Surfside Beach to eat bait thrown in by fishermen.

North Carolina natives Matt and Dana Rice were visiting Surfside Beach – a popular fishing destination along South Carolina’s Grand Strand – with their family, when tourists spotted anglers throwing leftover bait into the water.

The video, which was taken just 150 feet off the shores of the beach, shows the sharks scrambling for the fish being thrown in by local fishermen.

You can also hear several children’s voices in the background, counting the sharks as they surface.

According to local television stations WBTW, Surfside Beach visitor Erik Miller was shaken after seeing the video, which has now amassed over 350,000 views on Facebook.

‘Those are huge sharks,’ he told WBTW. ‘They could easily take your leg off or swallow a child.’

Though the appearance of the animals was surprising to tourists, local fisherman on the pier said that it’s quite a usual occurrence.

‘Sometimes you’ll see ten at a time come up circling the bait,’ a local called Brad Simpson said.

As someone who fishes at the pier three days per week, he also said that the number of sharks in the area have decreased the likelihood of a successful catch.

However, the sand sharks aren't of particular concern for humans, insists a local Professor of Marine Science

‘If you get a nice fish on and try to bring him in, a shark will usually get him,’ Simpson said.

However, Professor of Marine Science at Coastal Carolina University, Dan Abel insists that there is no need for concern.

Sand sharks, while intimidating looking, are not dangerous and shouldn’t be in the area for too much longer before they migrate South for winter.

‘They’ll be here a while longer,’ Abel told WBTW. ‘But when the day length starts to get shorter and the temperature drops below 70 degrees in the water they’ll start moving South and maybe a little more off shore.’

However, the Grand Strand does have some species that stay year round and Abel admits that the popular area can make for good shark habitat.

Since it’s difficult to identify the various breeds in the murky water, he advises those who do see a shark to stay out of the ocean.
