U.S. goalie Tim Howard was randomly drug-tested immediately after Tuesday's match against Belgium during which he set a World Cup record by making an amazing 16 saves.

Howard wasn't able to join his teammates in the locker room immediately after the 2-1 defeat because FIFA selected him to take the test.

‘I got dragged into drug testing, again, randomly,’ Howard told ESPN Radio when asked about the somber mood after the match. ‘So I didn't hear all of [the reactions].’

Heroic: American goalkeeper Tim Howard blocked 16 shots on goal Tuesday night - posting an astonishing performance in the USMNT's 1-2 loss against Belgium

Two players from both teams are randomly drug-tested after each World Cup match, per FIFA regulations.

But some fans might wonder just how random Howard's selection could be - especially after the goalkeeper's impressive game. 

He joked to ESPN that ‘maybe’ the test stopped being random after his 10th or 11th save.

FIFA has yet to release the results of Howard's test. No player has tested positive for banned substances at this World Cup.

Pentagon chief Hagel called Tim Howard on Wednesday to offer his congratulations and acknowledge the 'Secretary of Defense' joke that spread over the past day

For his 
efforts in turning back the Belgians’ numerous attempts on goal, Howard 
was briefly named the U.S. secretary of defense on Wikipedia.

Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel called Howard on Wednesday to offer his congratulations and even acknowledge the joke.

In
 praise of Howard, The Pentagon released a statement: 'Secretary of 
Defense Chuck Hagel called U.S. Men’s National Team goalkeeper Tim 
Howard to thank him for defending the United States of America at the 
World Cup.

'Secretary
 Hagel congratulated Howard on his record-breaking game and a great run 
in Brazil. He invited Howard and the entire team to come to the Pentagon
 later this year. He told Howard that with some training, he could 
someday become the real secretary of defense.'

Howard was the toast of the nation following his heroics and 
he appearing on two morning shows the day after the U.S. Men's National 
Team was eliminated from the tournament, Howard appeared undaunted.

'We
 couldn’t have given anymore. We played four phenomenal games and, you 
know, last night everybody gave everything they had,' he told Good Morning America, his voice hoarse from Tuesday night's match. 

'And sometimes you don’t win, but we’re proud of ourselves.'

Howard spent the game against the Red Devils standing on his head over and over again - making an incredible 16 saves, the most in a single World Cup Match in more than 50 years.

Head held high: Howard was cheered on by Today show host Natalie Morales the day after he tried to keep his team alive in a heartbreaking defeat

Despite the performance, which earned him the love of his country and the admiration of the world, the New Jersey-native said it wasn't his best work - simply because his team lost 1-2.

'Individually, yeah I had to make a few saves. Probably more than I would have liked to have,' he told the Today show.

'But, as I mentioned before, that's what I've signed up to do - stick my face in front of balls and try and keep them out. It just didn't work out quite according to plan yesterday.'

Howard said the performance - despite the USA being out-shot 38 to 14 - showed that his team could perform well at the World Cup level, despite having holes.

'We can compete, there's always pieces to the puzzle missing until we get it exactly right,' he said.

He added that he and his teammates appreciated the massive fan interest in soccer, both at their matches in Brazil and back home in the United States.

'The numbers are staggering. Not only the television numbers, which are obvious, but in the parks and the bars and everywhere in between. It was incredible to see,' he said.

'We were motivated by that and inspired by that. We saw all the videos and the highlights of our fans, and it was special to be a part of that. They felt like they were part of it here, and we felt like we were part of it back home.'

Despite expressing hope for the future of the U.S. Men's National Team - the 35-year-old declined to comment on his own future. Asked on GMA about whether he had his eye on the World Cup in Russia in 2018, he responded: 'That seems a lifetime away. Right now it's still very emotional from the game.

'I'm looking forward to spending some time with my kids, you know.'
