French President Francois Hollande is going stag, but the Obama administration is pulling out all the stops to entertain him with a State Dinner full of pomp, circumstance, gourmet eats, and R&B music.

The Bronx singer, rapper and record producer Mary J. Blige will perform after the meal, the White House announced Monday.

L'affaire américaine will take place outdoors, in a tent on the South Lawn. Secret Service will have extra protection arrayed along the perimeter of the White House property.

Under the tent, White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford will serve up the best of America, with a noted nod to the French.

'This event highlights the talents of our Nation’s cheese artisans,' the printed program says.

False advertising? The White House laid out some place settings in the ornate State Dining Room for press photographers to see, but the State Dinner will be held outside under a giant white tent

It's a salad, not a fishbowl: White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford holds the 'Winter Garden Salad' he'll offer guests Tuesday night at the State Dinner in honor of French President Francois Hollande -- a combination of mixed radishes, baby carrots, merlot lettuce and red wine vinaigrette

White House Executive Pastry Chef William Yosses holds a dessert tray  including maple fudge, biscuits and cotton candy -- the after-dinner treats for Tuesday night

Entertainment: Mary J. Blige probably won't perform her smash hit 'Family Affair' for the newly single French premier

Deputy US Chief of Protocol Natalie Jones, not the former French first lady, accompanied Hollande for his first steps on U.S. soil this week -- he's without both long-time girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler and more recent mistress Julie Gayet

And the first course will be caviar – although not the Russian kind that might cast a favorable light on President Vladimir Putin. Hollande and a hush-hush guest list will dine on American Osetra, grown in Illinois estuaries.

A winter garden salad of mixed radish and baby carrots served on merlot lettuce ''pays tribute to The First Lady’s White House Kitchen Garden,' according to the program, but the White House stopped short of saying the veggies actually came from Mrs. Obama's garden.

Also on offer will be quail eggs from Pennsylvania, twelve separate varieties of potatoes from three states, dry-aged ribeye steaks, a chocolate malted layer cake with vanilla ice cream, fudge made from Vermont maple syrup, lavender shortbread cookies and orange-zest cotton candy.

Wines on the table will be from California's Napa Valley, and from Washington state and Virginia. The Thibaut-Jannison 'Blanc de Chardonnay' is made near Monticello, the home of the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson.

Hollande and President Barack Obama made a joint visit to the estate on Monday.

The multiple Grammy-winner Mary J. Blige, shown at a Super Bowl party, will entertain the French president and his entourage, but there's been no word on whether Hollande is a fan of American R&B

President Barack Obama welcomed Hollande to the U.S. at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Monday, prior to a visit to the Thomas Jefferson estate at Monticello, Virginia

News of Hollande's split from his partner Valeria Trierweiler sent shock waves through France, but the president's reputation got a boost when his affair was made public

The other woman: Film actress Julie Gayet

The French president's official visit on Tuesday marks his first journey to America since he split from his long-time girlfriend, the former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler, after news surfaced of his affair with actress Julie Gayet.

His popularity in his country soared after the dalliance as revealed.

Like Mrs. Obama's recent 50th birthday party, the soiree won't include any dancing – a move certain to quell any fears of embarrassing Hollande sans date.

Hollande and Obama will have a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday, followed by a press conference.

The State Dinner will be served on rented China.

18 years in coming: The last French leader who made a State Visit to the U.S. was Valery Giscard d'Estaing (L), who brought his wife Anne-Aymone Sauvage de Brantes (2nd R) to visit President Gerald Ford and first lady Betty Ford at the White House in 1976
