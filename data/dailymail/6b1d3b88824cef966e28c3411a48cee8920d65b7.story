Very bright: Chetana Guduru, 17, died after being found shot on Monday at her home

A 17-year-old high school student tipped for a bright future has been shot dead by her mother in what appears to be an attempted murder-suicide.

Chetana Guduru, a pupil at Seminole High School in Orlando, Florida, was found mortally wounded on Monday morning in her mother's bed, dying a few hours later at Orlando Regional Medical Center.

Her mother, who was found nearby suffering from a gunshot wound, is now at the same hospital, and has been formally accused of first-degree premeditated murder, according to Oviedo police.

Lt Mike Beavers of Oviedo police told the Orlando Sentinel that the mother, Sujatha Guduru, told them she had planned a murder-suicide for a few weeks and had bought a .38-caliber revolver within the past fortnight.

Police added that she wrote an email to her brother, explaining her plan, although she did not give a reason.

The brother reportedly came round to check on them when he received the email and discovered them both suffering from gunshot wounds. Chetana's grandmother, who lives in the house with them, was unharmed.

Pupils and teachers paid tribute to Chetana, who was in the school's International Baccalaureate program and who had a number of acceptance letters for colleges. She was also a candidate for the U.S. Presidential Scholar Program for top seniors in the country.

Police have charged the mother with premeditated murder although are struggling to establish a motive for the shooting

Devonta Barriner, a student, told WFTV that they found out about the shooting in the school auditorium.

'It was very emotional actually, and it was very sad,' she said. 'That's crazy, how could you kill your own child?'

Michael Lawrence, a spokesman for Seminole County Public Schools, said: 'The student was very, very intelligent and very bright. She was a very hardworking student.'

On Monday night, Chetana's friends and class mates held an impromtu memorial to mourn her.

'The students are struggling, but they want the 'Nole Nation' and our community to know that they will overcome this tragedy, TOGETHER, and are asking for prayers for Chetana's family, friends and everyone that knew her,' the school said on its Facebook page.Â
