Hull winger Fetuli Talanoa has signed a contract extension which will keep him at the KC Stadium until the end of the 2017 season.

The 27-year-old former South Sydney threequarter joined the Airlie Birds ahead of the 2014 Super League season and had the distinction of playing every minute of the campaign, scoring 10 tries in his 27 appearances.

Talanoa lost his ever-present record when illness ruled him out of the second match of the 2015 season against Warrington.

Fetuli Talanoa (pictured playing for South Sydney last year) has signed a new two-year deal at Hull FC

Hull coach Lee Radford said: 'This was a very easy decision for us to make. Fetuli has been a great signing for us and has continued where he left of last year.

'He is a big part of the squad, not only on the field but off it too. I know he has really settled in the area and loves the club which is reflected in his performances.

'Hopefully he can be an integral part of a successful period at the club.'
