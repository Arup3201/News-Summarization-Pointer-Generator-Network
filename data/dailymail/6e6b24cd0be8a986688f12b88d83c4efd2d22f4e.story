An angler who won a fishing competition with a huge bass that he stole from an aquarium has been let off the hook by a judge who spared him from jail.

Sneaky Matthew Clark, 29, pinched the 13lb fish from the tourist attraction but pretended that he had in fact caught it in a gruelling sea fishing contest.

He won the £800 first prize and proudly posed for photos with his winning 'catch' dangling beside him.

But a fellow competitor smelled something fishy when he recognised the bass from a recent trip to the aquarium with his family

Something Fishy: Angler Matt Clark, 29, pinched this 13oz bass from an aquarium in St Peter Port, Guernsey to win a sea fishing competition

The other fisherman quickly 
alerted aquarium staff who realised that the fish was missing, as well 
as competition organisers who informed the police.

He was today ordered by a
 judge to carry out 100 hours of community service after he admitted 
burglary and fraud charges.

Judge Phillip Robey told Clark that his acts had been 'mean to the aquarium and anglers', but spared him a jail sentence.

He also ordered Clark to take an oath of good behaviour for two years, and told him that he would face jail if he broke the terms of the sentence handed to him at Guernsey Magistrates Court in the Channel Islands.

The court heart how Clark, of St Sampson, Guernsey, had previously worked at the island's St Peter Port Aquarium and owed the manager, Dave Miller, £1,500.

He hatched a plan to break into the building and steal the fish to win the competition before returning the bass to its tank and use his prize winning cash to pay off some of his debt.

At 6.30pm on July 9 last year - the final day of the Bailiwick Bass Club Open Competition - Clark scaled cliffs and climbed a rope ladder to reach the building before he entered the aquarium through a back door.

The bungling raider dropped the fish as he made his escape and injured it, but managed to pick it up again and carry it to the 8pm  'weigh-in' at a nearby fishing tackle shop Tackle Direct.

The enormous fish tipped the scales at 13lb 13oz - trouncing the nearest competitor who only managed a catch of 10lb 3oz.

Clark was congratulated by the other contestants and was due to pick up his winnings at a ceremony later in the week.

Posing: Clark proudly posed with his 'winning' fish and had been due to collect his £800 winnings when another angler recognised the bass from the aquarium

However, fellow entrant Shane Bentley, 38, thought that he had seen the winning fish before.

Speaking before the hearing, he said: 'Me and my wife were taking the kids to the aquarium and we'd seen a bass in a tank - it stood out because it had some very distinct markings on its head.

'I had gone to congratulate the winner because I heard it was a monster, and when I saw it I thought "heck, that's a beauty".

'It wasn't until the bass was lifted out of the tank for the photo that I thought "that's the fish from the aquarium".

'I immediately informed club members of my suspicions but they laughed.

'The next morning I took ten minutes off work to go to the aquarium.

'They hadn't opened but the women let me in and I said, "where's that big bass with marks on its head?".

'I looked in the tank but I couldn't see
 the fish, then the woman looked as well and she couldn't find the fish.
 She then called the owner down and he couldn't see the fish.'

Mr Bentley, who has been fishing for more than 25 years, immediately contacted the competition organisers, who alerted police.Officers seized the head from the winning fish carcass and photographs of the missing bass as evidence as they investigated.

Evidence: Clark had planned to return the fish to the aquarium before anyone noticed it had gone, but was said to have panicked and sold it to a fishmonger

When he was arrested, Clark maintained that he had caught the fish off rocks near Beaucette.

However, he later confessed in full.

The court heard how competition 
entrants had spent days battling bad weather in their efforts to catch 
the biggest bass for a top prize of £800.

Mr
 Bentley, who himself stood in the rain for hours until he snagged a 5lb
 bass, said it was 'fate' that he had been to the aquarium two weeks 
before.

The club has 66 members and the 2012 open competition had 29 entrants.

Fishing club president Daryl Butcher said: 'It's unusual, to say the least.'

Sam Maindonald, mitigating, said that Clark was under pressure from debt collectors and regretted stealing the fish.

She said that as a result of the offences Clark had lost his home and partner, as well as contact with his children.

A spokesman for the aquarium said that Clark had intended to return the sea bass but panicked and sold it to a fishmonger instead - who killed it.

She claimed he had stolen the fish because he was 'arrogant' and 'so competitive he has to win'.

'The whole thing was completely bizarre and happened in a 24 hour period,' she said.

'Not exactly the average day for an aquarium.

'The fishing competition was on the Monday so on the Monday evening he broke in and stole the sea bass.

'That same night he took it along to the judges and produced it and was told he'd won the contest.

But everyone there knew something was going on.

'He had intended to bring it back and put it in the tank but he knew he'd been rumbled and panicked.

'He took it to a fish seller who didn't realise it was stolen and chopped it up. All we got back was the head and tail.

'He only did it because he's massively arrogant and competitive.

'He had to to win the competition and decided to steal from us to do it.'
