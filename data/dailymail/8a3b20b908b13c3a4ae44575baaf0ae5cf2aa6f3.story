Depending where you look, Manchester City are anywhere from second to fourth in Champions League Group E following Sergio Aguero’s last-gasp winning goal against Bayern Munich.

Level on five points with Roma and CSKA Moscow – with Bayern sailing clear as group winners – City’s unusual path in this season’s competition has caused a few sore heads when it comes to working out exactly where they currently stand in the table.

Ultimately UEFA rules will dictate whether the English champions progress or not but as it stands there seems no universal understanding of their position.

(Top) A national newspaper had Manchester City in second place in the table thanks to their goal difference.

(Bottom) The true reflection of the group after five games has City fourth, behind Roma and CSKA Moscow

European football’s governing body have City in third on their website – but this appears to contradict their own rules.

Point 7.06 in the latest Champions League regulations dictates a number of principles in descending order of importance for splitting two or more teams who finish level on points.

The primary method is to use results drawn from only those teams who are tied. So, in this case, Bayern's results should be eliminated from the calculations.

That leaves Roma and CSKA (yet to play their final game against the German champions) on five points, but City effectively on two points – after draws at home to Roma and in Moscow, and with their final game in Italy to come and rendered a must-win.

The second determining factor goes on goal difference, which is needed to separate Roma from CSKA. Given Rthe Serie A side lost 7-1 at home to Bayern, it is fairly easy to see how discarding those results against Pep Guardiola’s men will benefit them.

Doing so leaves the Italians with a goal difference of four, and the Russians on minus three. So taking all that into account, as it stands, the group should read Roma second, CSKA third and City fourth. That is the consensus among English media now.

So why do UEFA have it Roma second, City third and CSKA fourth? The answer: alphabetical order. UEFA only implement their rules once all matches have been played and all head-to-head records can be worked out.

Still not make sense? Well, UEFA have the teams listed as AS Roma, Manchester City, and PFC CSKA Moskva. The PFC is used to differentiate from CSKA’s other sporting teams (ice hockey, volleyball, basketball etc).

So there we have it. Enough information to make Manuel Pellegrini’s brain melt. To avoid any embarrassing miscalculations like at Bayern last year, he should just send out his team to win in the Stadio Olimpico.

WHAT WE KNOW...

WHERE IT GETS TRICKY...

P.S.

There is not a universal system adopted for splitting teams who finish level on points in domestic leagues. It ranges across the globe.

In England - as Manchester City well know - goal difference is the deciding factor. They became the first team to win the Premier League via that method in 2012 when Aguero (him again) struck in the last minute to beat QPR. City had the exact same record as rivals United but a superior goal difference.

Liverpool’s collapse from three up at Crystal Palace last year can well be attributed to their frantic pursuit of goals to close the gap on City, who once again had a better record in that respect. The Bundesliga uses the same method.

In Spain, head to head is used instead. When the three big teams were all close in the table last season it was Atletico Madrid who breathed easier than Real or Barcelona, given their advantageous record. As it happened they won La Liga by three points in any case. Serie A uses head to head also.

The French use goal difference, then goals scored, but if teams are still inseparable a play-off decider is staged to determine the champions.
