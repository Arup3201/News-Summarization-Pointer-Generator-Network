Vice President Joe Biden is now expected to apologize to Saudi officials for comments he made on Friday accusing the Arab nation of providing funding and arms to extremists in Syria.

The New York Times reports that Biden is in the process of contacting Saudi leaders to formally clarify that he does not believe the U.S. ally purposefully gave weapons to Syrian rebels with ties to al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.

In his remarks last week Biden also chastised Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for providing assistance to extremists. The vice president has already contacted government officials from both countries to explain himself.

Although they were not necessarily inaccurate, Biden's statements were harmful to the United States' tenuous coalition with the Middle Eastern countries, and they fueled concerns that Biden, a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, isn't tactful enough to serve as the nation's Commander in Chief.

The gaffe-prone vice president has made a number of verbal slip-ups in the last several weeks.

During a speech on Sept. 16 Biden called money-lenders who prey on soldiers serving abroad 'shylocks,' a word that is considered to be offensive to Jewish people.

The following day the vice president described an Asian politician as the 'wisest man in the Orient.' Orient and oriental are terms generally acceptable for tangible objects from Asia, but not for people. 

At the same event that Biden criticized Middle Eastern countries for their hand in the ascent of the Islamic State, he joked that being vice president can be a 'b***h' at times.

In yet another blunder, Biden told students attending his speech, which was held on the campus of Harvard University, that working with Saudi Arabia in the fight against ISIS was like Hitler's pairing with Joseph Stalin during World War II. 

'We knew Stalin was no-good S.O.B. from the beginning,' Biden said. 'But there is a thing called self-interest.'

The vice president prefaced the joke by saying he was 'being a little facetious.'

'All generalizations are false, including this one I’m about to make,' he noted.

Still, the ad-libbed statements at public events have the vice president's advisers wishing he would stick to the script, the Associated Press reports. 

Former aides to Biden who spoke with AP said that most of the time the vice president stays on message.

'But sometimes their pleas not to freelance were met with a roll of the eyes by Biden,' AP wrote, pointing out that before he became second-in-line for the presidency, Biden served  on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years and has 'strong views of his own' on foreign policy.

Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf cautioned that Biden will have a problem obtaining his party's support in 2016 if he keeps up the antics. 

'When he makes missteps, he becomes a character,' Sheinkopf told the Associated Press.

'Although he may be successful in lining up some of the Democratic leadership, he will be less likely to get the Democratic nomination if he looks foolish,' he added.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest came to Biden's defense on Monday during his daily briefing, calling him 'somebody who continues to be a core member of the president’s national security team.

Prodded about Biden's verbal missteps, Earnest told reporters, 'I think the vice president is somebody who has enough character to admit when he's made a mistake.'

'He's made a lot of mistakes in a short period of time,' one of Earnest's questioners replied.
