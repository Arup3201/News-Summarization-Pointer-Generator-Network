Residents have compared piles of rotting fish and crabs washed up on an idyllic Western Australian beach to having a sewerage dump near Uluru or the Sydney Opera House.

Jurien Bay is located on the state's mid west coast about 220 kilometres north of Perth and has experienced the problem since 2000.

Resident Ian Stiles helped set up the Jurien Bay Marine Park and was the former owner of a dive shop and 23-person passenger dive boat and said the situation was bad news for local tourism.

'It's ridiculous going to a tourist icon and having to pass by all these rotting fish and the horrible smell,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Fish and crab kills have been occurring in Jurien Bay for about 14 years with worst, pictured, in October and November last year

Aquatic life including fish, crabs and even stingrays are killed when seaweed becomes trapped in the bay and releases toxic hydrogen sulfide

'It smells worse than Indonesia harbour Tanjung Priok and that's in a Third World country.'

'It's like having a sewerage dump next to Uluru or the Sydney Opera House.' 

Mr Stiles estimates about 90 per cent of people accessing the marine park go through Jurien Bay and said the people who bought his boat business three years ago had since gone broke due to the problem.

He knows of other residents and business owners who moved from the tourist hotspot to other towns because of the problem.

'There are blue manna crabs laying on the sea floor - if they were anywhere else there would be birds everywhere,' he said.

Mr Stiles blames a marina built in the bay in 1988 and its lack of maintenance for causing the problem.

Mr Stiles said the smell of the rotting fish and crabs was worse than ports in Tanjung Priok in Indonesia (pictured)

Hundreds of fish can wash up during the fish kills causing a foul smell and turning tourists away from the bay and nearby marine park

He said the marina caused a build up of sand at its mouth and resulted in seaweed getting stuck in the bay after storms.

As it rots releases hydrogen sulfide, which deprives water of oxygen and kills masses of fish and crabs. 'It's called rotten egg gas,' he said of the smell.

'We need it brought back to its 1988 design specifications and then dredged every three to four years,' he said. 'If we dredge it out regularly we would possibly not have this problem.'

'Dead fish at the bottom of the marina are causing pathogens,' he added and said the problem had also killed other marine life such as stingrays.

He said an engineering-based solution at the marina's narrow entrance and ongoing maintenance was needed to prevent polluted water getting trapped in the bay.

The worst fish kill in recent history was last October, but on Sunday August 2, residents have again faced the horrendous sight and smell of rotting aquatic life.

While the bulk of dead animals wash up in the first days of a fish kill, it can still take weeks for remaining animals at the bottom of the bay to wash up

The state's Department of Health is warning people not to swim in bay or eat fish caught in it, reported the ABC.

Health concerns caused by hydrogen sulfide include head aches, mild anxiety and nausea, the department said.

Mr Stiles said while most of the dead sea animals that washed up just over a week ago were cleaned up straight away using Bobcats and small trucks, there were still some dead fish washing up.

Mr Stiles is president of Jurien Bay Marina Action Group, formed following the 2013 fish kill, and said the bay was last dredged 2006 but this was not sufficient to fix the problem.

He said the first time hydrogen sulfide was released in the bay was 1998, but it was not until 2000 that the first major fish kill happened.

Another problem caused by the release of the gas is pitting of brass and stainless steal.

'Boats had to be brought of the water last October and November because of the problem,' he said.

Mr Stiles blames previous West Australian governments for not acting on the issue sooner but said the recent fish kills were leading to the first action on the issue since 2000.

Moore State Nationals MP Shane Love raised the issue affecting the bay and its community in parliament fol following the 2013 fish kill.

As a result former transport minister Troy Buswell committed to dredging the marina while working to establish a long-term solution to the problem.

The Department of Transport is using wave and wind monitoring cameras at the marina to collection information about the problem.

Sand is currently being excavated in the marina's channel to allow a better flow of water and prevent seaweed from getting trapped and triggering issue.

Mr Love said a major dredging program was expected to start later this year to alleviate the situation in the short-term.

'It will provide for a healthier environment for some time to come but the problem will continue to occur if we don't get on top of the movement of sand and seagrass into the harbour itself,' he said.

The Department of Transport will monitor water quality in the bay while environmental and planning approvals are in being sought to enable dredging works to start.
