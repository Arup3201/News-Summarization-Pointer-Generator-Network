Charged: Two men are due in court today charged over the death of Constable Philippa Reynolds (pictured)

Two men are due in court today to face charges over the death of a policewoman whose patrol car was hit by a stolen 4x4 in Northern Ireland.

Constable Philippa Reynolds, 27, from the Greater Belfast area, died when the unmarked car she was travelling in turned into the path of the vehicle in Londonderry in the early hours of Saturday.

One of the men, aged 25, has been charged with ten offences, including causing death by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking causing death or grievous bodily injury, burglary and driving while unfit.

The other man, aged 23, has been charged with aggravated vehicle taking causing death or grievous bodily injury, burglary, criminal damage and assisting an offender.

They are both due to appear at Derry Magistrates' Court this morning.

Ms Reynolds, a former teacher, had been in the Police Service of Northern Ireland for two years.

Her commander in Derry, Chief Superintendent Stephen Cargin, said the officer was one of the most enthusiastic he had worked with

He added: 'She was enthusiastic, bubbly and had a beautiful personality. She was just loved by her colleagues and she turned that love to the community she served.'

Aftermath: Forensic officers study the scene around the car Constable Reynolds had been travelling in

Wreckage: A crumpled 4x4 remained at the scene while police gathered evidence

Line of duty: Constable Reynolds was sitting in the rear driver's seat when the vehicles collided

'She was a young 27-year-old officer,
just two years' service, in the prime of her life, doing what she loved
to do - and that was serving the community to the best of her ability,'
he said.

'Her colleagues are devastated, as I am as her commander, as we all are as a police service.'

Mr Cargin said he believed the officer, who was sitting in the rear driver's side seat, would have died instantly due to the force of the impact with the silver Toyota Land Cruiser in Limavady Road.

Two other officers in the patrol car suffered non-serious injuries.
