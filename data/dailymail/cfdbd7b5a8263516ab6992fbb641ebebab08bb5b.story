Bookies believe tennis star Andy Murray has asked girlfriend Kim Sears to marry him - or is just about to - after a flurry of betting on him popping the question at Wimbledon.

Tennis fans have been betting heavily on the Scottish champion to both retain his title and get engaged at 8/1 with bookmaker William Hill, which eventually stopped taking bets on it.

A spokesman said: 'That price was backed heavily. It indicates to us that he got engaged. Maybe someone saw him buying a ring?'

Winning her hand? There are rumours that tennis star Andy Murray has proposed to girlfriend Kim Sears - or is about to - following heavy betting on him both winning Wimbledon and getting down on one knee

He added that they are still offering odds of 33/1 that 27-year-old Murray will both win the tournament and drop to one knee during the acceptance speech live on BBC One.

However, a representative for Murray said: 'Not sure where the speculation is coming from, but it’s complete nonsense.'

Sussex-born Miss Sears, who has an English Literature degree, has been in a relationship with Murray for nine years after the pair met at the US Open in 2005. Her father is player-turned-coach Nigel Sears.

He has admitted he couldn't have come back to win Wimbledon in 2013 following his 2012 defeat if it hadn't been for her unwavering support.

Unlike many football WAGS, Miss Sears, 26, shys away from the spotlight as she focuses on her career as an artist and looks after the couple's beloved dogs Maggie May and Rusty at their home in Surrey.

Murray is 
notoriously reluctant to answer questions about his relationship with 
Kim Sears but earlier this year he was forced to deny that he plans to 
marry his long-term love this year after joking about his love life on 
Twitter.

Asked
 when he plans to marry Miss Sears during a Twitter Q&A with fans in
 January, Murray responded: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon,
 should be a great day.'

But
 just hours later, Murray was forced to issue another tweet explaining 
that his words were said with his tongue firmly in cheek after the 
original message went viral.

He tweeted: '3 things.. I don't smoke grass, I'm not getting married(yet) and I don't want to kill rafael Nadal.. [sic]'

At the time a spokesman for the star confirmed that 'Andy Murray is not getting married this summer.'

In a previous interview with the Scottish Daily Mail he spoke about his relationship with Miss Sears and confessed that he would like children with her in future.

He said: ‘I can see myself having a family one day. It is something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’
