Bring back the old scrabble: Helen Jones from Southport is leading a protest against the changes. She has spent half an hour every day playing Scrabble for the last five years

Thousands of silver surfers have joined a boycott of Scrabble after the popular online version of the board game was replaced.

Avid players said that they had built up close friendships around the world as they competed at the game on Facebook.

Some had built up impressive player rankings after dedicating hours to the word game over the past few years.

But overnight those high scores and 
contact lists were wiped after the makers of the game enjoyed by 
3.5million users replaced it with a new version without warning.

Kath
Ward, 72, from Dunstable in Bedfordshire said that she has now lost 
touch with most of the online friends she had made around the world in 
four years of playing.

She 
said: ‘My daughter knows that I like Scrabble, so when she found the 
game on Facebook she encouraged me to join and I signed up just to play.

‘I
have loyally played it every day since unless I am on holiday or 
terribly busy.

I play for about three quarters of an hour to an hour 
depending on how many games I have on the go.

‘I
have made friends with people all over the world. People were very 
nice, you start off saying something like “that was a good word” and go 
from there.

‘You get to know people. One of the people I regularly played with is in Spain and when we were there she invited us to visit.

‘It saved all your games, so you had a record of all the people you had played and your statistics.

‘This game means a lot to people – mostly silver surfers – they had dozens of friends on it. But it’s all been wiped overnight.’

Mrs Ward has joined the chorus of thousands of outraged users angry after Scrabble makers Mattel changed the online game earlier this week to a different version that does not have the previous data.

She said: ‘People are saying how dare they do this? People are leaving it in droves. All the comments are total outrage at the way we have been treated.

‘I have a couple of the email addresses of people I played with, but not all. These are people I have been talking to for three or four years.

‘They have shown complete disregard to the people who have been playing the game for all those years.’

Game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘brash’.

Helen Jones, 54, a support worker from Southport said: ‘I’ve been playing for the past five years. I’d play for around an hour of an evening when I come home from work.

‘I’ve met some really interesting people. Of course they do not substitute friends, but we had a community. I’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people I played with knew that and would ask how it was going.

Classic: The makers of the beloved board game have outraged loyal players who work on building high scores and like to communicate with their opponents

Popular: Online and tablet versions of the game have been popular among 'silver surfers'. This iPad version allows people to play on-the-go

‘We have lost all that and all the game records have gone. This is Scrabble, people are completely obsessed with their statistics. This is not some Candy Crush game.

‘We used to have a really classy board but now it’s vulgar. It has been totally Americanised.

‘They’re waking a sleeping lion by doing this. Our protest is growing momentum.’

Sarah Wilson wrote on the Scrabble Facebook page: ‘It’s garish and cumbersome... there is nothing in it for me so it’s over between us.’

Kevin Mercury Winder added:  ‘When I was introduced to Scrabble, I thought it was totally amazing, you were able to play with people all over the world, actually chat whilst game in progress… it was virtually like taking out a real scrabble board and sitting down to a game with a friend.

‘Now it has been ruined and for what reason?’

Neerja Singh wrote: ‘I cannot see the performance stats of the random players I am up against - I have 6,000 games under my belt, with a high score of 654.

‘I like playing tough opponents, I want to see the stats of several people online - and choose who I want to be pitted against!

‘I do not want to play some random beginner or somebody who is out to make lewd conversation.

‘Do not tell me which friends I can invite to scrabble. I have played - and thrashed the daylights out of friends. I don’t want to play against friends who take defeat personally.’

A spokesman for Mattel said: ‘The Scrabble Facebook game is now managed by a new partner EA Mobile.

The benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices, the addition of the Collins Official Scrabble Wordlist, the ability to play in six languages, the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad-free.

‘As part of the transition, we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics, the timer mode and the manual match-making function.

'The new version will have the same robust statistics moving forward.’
