A former ballet teacher who died after a fall at home was given six doses of morphine shortly after her accident.

Doreen Mannion, 85, who broke her leg when she slipped in January last year, possibly died due to ‘morphine intoxication’, a coroner said. The inquest was then adjourned so that a clinician who administered one of the doses could give evidence.

Mrs Mannion received five doses of the painkiller from paramedics and a further dose soon after she arrived at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) – a total of six in about 75 minutes. She had slipped as she went upstairs but had to lie on her hall floor waiting for an ambulance for two hours and 45 minutes, while her family tried to keep her warm.

They were afraid to move her in case she had broken her back.

When paramedics finally arrived just after 2.30am, they gave her five 2.5mg doses of morphine in about 25 minutes, the inquest into her death in Manchester was told.

Mrs Mannion was then taken to  the MRI, where a doctor gave her a further 10mg dose of the drug at 3.51am. She died two months later after weeks in intensive care.

Mrs Mannion's son said they had a 'long and alarming' wait for an ambulance after she fell over at her home in Old Moat Lane, Manchester (pictured)

Her son Richard, 63, a former NHS worker, told the inquest: ‘The wait didn’t do mother any good. She was on the cold  floor and we couldn’t keep her warm. It was the most long and alarming wait.

‘She went in with a broken leg which we thought was just a nuisance for her. Within 24 hours she was in a condition she would not recover from. Great efforts were made by everyone, including those at the MRI and paramedics, but something has happened.’

Coroner Sara Lewis said the amount of morphine the widow was given could have led to her death. ‘We have a lot of morphine over a short amount of time,  and we have a possible cause of death of morphine intoxication,’ she added.

The inquest, at Manchester Town Hall (pictured), was adjourned until the doctor involved can give evidence

She adjourned the inquest as the doctor who had prescribed Mrs Mannion morphine in hospital was not there to answer her questions. Representatives from the hospital said they could not identify who the doctor was from the signature and there was no printed name on the form.

‘Given that this is a serious issue and the cause of death that has been offered includes morphine in it as a causation, we need more information on that,’ the coroner added.

Mrs Mannion, who was known to pupils by her maiden name Miss Bardsley, toured with the Sadler’s Wells ballet company as a young girl and taught dance near her home in Withington,  Manchester, for about 30 years.

Her husband, also called Richard, died in 1996. Speaking after the hearing, son Richard said: ‘I thought my mother would see me out. She was very independent. I would always find her up ladders and she still brought the coal for the fire up from the cellar.

‘She did her ballet exercises every day until well into her 70s.

‘I want to know what happened to her. We just want answers.’
