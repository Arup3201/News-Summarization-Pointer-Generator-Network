A police officer throttled his girlfriend and kicked her in the stomach after flying into a drunken rage because he left £30 in a cashpoint, a court heard.

James Vosper, 41, who serves with Gloucestershire Constabulary, allegedly started drinking heavily after realising his mistake and texted partner Melissa Mustoe that 'everything has gone to rat s***'.

He continued drinking for nearly two hours until mother-of-two Miss Mustoe arrived home and they rowed about how much he had consumed - before Vosper launched himself at her, it was claimed.

He grabbed Miss Mustoe around the throat and forced her onto the sofa, then she frantically dialled 999 and he kicked her in the stomach as she was on the phone to his colleagues, the court was told.

Miss Mustoe allegedly managed to escape his clutches and lock him out of the house in Abbeymead, Gloucestershire, and remained on the phone for 40 minutes until police arrived and arrested him.

Ian Jackson, prosecuting, told Bristol Magistrates' Court: ‘He wrapped around her neck and pinned her to the sofa with one hand. She was unable to breathe.

‘Having released her he then kicked her in the stomach while she was on the phone to police.’

He added: ‘During the course of the 999 call you can hear part of the alleged assault actually taking place - you can hear her reaction.

‘Very shortly in, about four or five minutes you hear her exclaim she has just been kicked in the stomach by Mr Vosper.’

He said when police arrived at the house they noted a number of marks on Miss Mustoe’s neck and face. Vosper denies assault by beating at the couple's home on December 11 last year.

He told police: ‘I came home, she went mad, I just wanted to go to bed, she gave me a slap.’  Vosper claims she attacked him and he was only acting in self-defence.

But Miss Mustoe said her partner was in a bad mood because of the cashpoint incident and after returning home she expressed concerns about how much he had drunk.

Mr Jackson said: ‘She also indicates she had reason to believe he was not in the best of moods.

‘He had sent her a text earlier in the day because he had been out shopping buying three bottles of wine and some desserts for his daughters, and he had asked for cashback from the self-service till.

‘He had wandered away before collecting the cash and when he went back to get it, it had gone - someone had taken it. The text seems quite angry - he says “everything has gone to rat s***”. He seems to be quite angry about it.’

'He wrapped around her neck and pinned her to the sofa with one hand. She was unable to breathe. Having released her he then kicked her in the stomach while she was on the phone to police'

He added that in the text at 6.45pm he said: ‘Well I'm well f*** off, everything has gone to rat s***. That's £30, I don't believe it, I'm close to f****** losing it.’

Miss Mustoe replied and told Vosper not to worry about the money but when she returned home around 8.30pm a fight allegedly broke out.

She rang emergency services at 11.15pm claiming to have been assaulted by her partner and asking for protection.

During the call Vosper could be heard repeatedly demanding entry to the house and she told the operator she had locked him out because she 'needed to be safe'.

The court heard that Vosper was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following an incident at work where he was given six months off to recover.

He admitted to investigating officers he had begun to drink heavily through that period but strongly denied having an alcohol problem. The trial continues.
