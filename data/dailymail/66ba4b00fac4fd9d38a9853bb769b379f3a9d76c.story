Her career as an author took off – and various debts were settled – thanks to the success of her books and TV cartoons about Budgie The Little Helicopter.

Now, 25 years after Budgie's last adventure, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, has revived her writing career in another attempt to improve her finances.

She has written a new book, Fergie's Farm, based on her childhood in the Hampshire countryside, featuring a band of friendly farmyard characters.

The Duchess, 55, first had the idea for Fergie's Farm three years ago when she was trying to pay off debt accumulated in the 1990s. 

The incomplete book was shelved, but the Duchess has finally finished the manuscript. 

Her spokesman said: 'It's now at a very advanced stage and the book is written. She has set up a company to deal with all of the formats needed for children's books today, including e-books, apps and games.'

The Duchess spent some of her childhood on 480-acre Dummer Down Farm in Hampshire – and stayed on with her father, Major Ronald Ferguson, after her parents divorced when she was eight.

Sarah's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie and her ex-husband Prince Andrew, with whom she remains close, are said to be fully behind her in the new business venture.

The Duchess has yet to find a publisher but it is possible she will strike a deal with Simon and Schuster, who have published six other titles by her.

Her children's books about Budgie the Little Helicopter were the inspiration for a popular animated television series.

On release of the first book, the Duchess was forced to deny she had copied the idea for the series from the earlier Hector the Helicopter book by A.W. Baldwin.
