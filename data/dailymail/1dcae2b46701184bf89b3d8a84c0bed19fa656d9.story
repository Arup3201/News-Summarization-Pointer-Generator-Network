Southampton fans will be wondering whether they'll have a team left to support when the Premier League kicks off in the three weeks time as the summer exodus down on the south coast shows no signs of stopping.

Following Southampton's impressive eighth-placed finish last season, it was expected certain members of the squad would move on.

As it was, boyhood Red Rickie Lambert moved to Liverpool for £4million and was followed to Anfield by Adam Lallana who joined Brendan Rodgers' side in a £23million deal.

Mass exodus: Southampton have willingly allowed a number of key players to leave the club this summer

Switch: Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert both left Southampton for Liverpool following an impressive season

Red Devil: Talented left-back Luke Shaw joined Manchester United from Southampton in a £30million deal

Man at the helm: Mauricio Pochettino left St Mary's this summer to take charge of league rivals Tottenham

Meanwhile, talented left-back Luke Shaw joined the Louis van Gaal revolution at Old Trafford as the 19-year-old signed for Manchester United for £30million.

Now, with still six weeks of the transfer window remaining, it was announced on Friday that Dejan Lovren is on the brink of joining up with Lallana and Lambert on Merseyside.

Just as that news was sinking in, Saints 
supporters then had to hear young right-back Calum Chambers is all set 
for a £12m switch to Arsenal.

'When will it stop?' followers of the 
club must be thinking. Perhaps once Morgan Schneiderlin - heavily linked
 with Tottenham - joins up with former Southampton boss Mauricio 
Pochettino at White Hart Lane? Yes, even the manager departed.

After that, bad boy Dani Osvaldo will likely return to Italy with Inter Milan keen on the former Roma striker while frontman Jay Rodriguez, interesting both Spurs and Liverpool, has at least been offered a five-year contract to ward off any potential suitors.

With barely anybody left to play, the question has to be asked: Why have Southampton stood aside to see most of their playing squad jump ship? It seems there's been no fight, no 'hands off warnings', nothing.

Such is the nature of the Premier League,
 any players with a smidgen of talent who perform well for an entire 
season will undoubtedly be hoovered up by the big boys.

However, boasting a squad of such quality, the club could have done more in an attempt to keep much of the side together. Where is the ambition?

Often these situations turn into long-running transfer sagas with the player either switching on August 31 or staying put. Not for Southampton, they've been quick to strike deals.

Southampton are in a strong financial position and could have easily told interested parties that the club's best players were not for sale. Instead, they chose to roll over and cash in at the first opportunity.

Of course, while it is wise to think about harmony 
among the camp and the damaging influence a player who doesn't want to 
be there can have on the dressing room, Southampton must also consider 
the fact that you need 11 players to play a football match - at this 
rate, that won't be possible.

Would half the team have left had former executive chairman Nicola Cortese remained at the club?

The
 Italian, who stepped down from his role at St Mary's over alleged 'differences' with
 owner Katharina Liebherr, is adamant the squad would still be 
together if he was still there.

Speaking to BBC Sport in May, Cortese said: 'I knew the
 players themselves wanted to stick together because this vision was 
something they believed in, too. I didn’t see any reason for them to go.

'We created those talents. It was key to keep them. You don't produce them just to sell, otherwise you give away your ambition.

'I
 didn’t have written offers, but I obviously had phone calls. My answer 
was that it was not going to happen for at least the next two seasons.

'The other chairmen respected that. Until the day I left, there were no offers.'

Following the mass departures, it is now up to new manager Ronald Koeman to start the rebuild job.

The Dutchman arrived from Feyenoord earlier this summer and has already raided his former club for £8million striker Graziano Pelle.

Serbian wideman Dusan Tadic, a £10.3million signing from FC Twente, has also arrived but Koeman, with just two new signings so far, has his work cut out in replacing so many vital players in just over a month.

If Koeman 
is given the majority of funds from the countless player sales, 
Southampton should have nothing to worry about. They may even be buoyed 
if the money is invested in the infrastructure of the club.

However,
 51-year-old Koeman has essentially been tasked with building a squad 
from scratch that is capable of finishing in the top-half of the table. 
That's a whole load of players who will need to gel in a short space of 
time.

Southampton's
 recent successes have stemmed from the club's esteemed academy but it 
mustn't be assumed that top players will continue to come coming through and so the 
club have to spend.

Having
 seemingly stepped aside to see almost the entire first-team move on, 
time will tell if Southampton have taken the right action this summer.
