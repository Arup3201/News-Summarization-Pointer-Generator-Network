With approximately 45 million visitors since it first opened in 2000, it's no wonder the London Eye needs a bit of a spring-clean.

Brave cleaners have scaled the 440ft-high attraction to begin the mammoth task of removing traffic film and grime that’s built up over the last 13 years of use.

Kärcher - a company specialising in large-scale cleaning projects - says the huge task will take three weeks as only two or three of its 32 pods can be cleaned per night.

Similar to a car wash, the specialist rope technicians are using hot water pressure washers to deep clean the structure.

Landmark: Approximately 3.5 million visit the London attraction every year - meaning around 45 million people have taken a ride on the wheel since it first opened

The London Eye has become the capital's most popular tourist attraction in the UK since it first opened on the banks of the River Thames in March 2000.

It is 443 ft tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 ft - making it the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe.

Around 3.5 million people pay to ride the Eye annually - meaning approximately 45.5 million have taken a trip on the iconic wheel. 

The London Eye will be open to the public throughout the clean, as the teams will work through the night to ensure there is no disruption for Londoners.

The clean is environmentally friendly and won’t cause any risk to the Thames as Kärcher will use PVC 'pools' to collect all water and residue from the clean and will drain this locally. 

Kevin Dyer, Head of Technical Operation at the London Eye said: 'This is very exciting for us as it’s the most extensive clean the structure has seen since its opening in 2000, which is a huge project.

'We are delighted to be working with Kärcher as we’ve seen some of the amazing work they have performed on other world- famous monuments. The London Eye will be ready for summer after its big clean.'

Simon Keeping, Managing Director of Kärcher UK said: 'Kärcher is proud to be working with the London Eye and cleaning such an important part of the London skyline.

'This is one of the largest projects we have worked on in Europe and we are ensuring that the clean is as environmentally friendly as possible.

'As the world’s leading cleaning specialists, our products demonstrate power through their ability to tackle the toughest jobs – including one of the tallest monuments in London!'

Kärcher has previously cleaned monuments across the world - including Mount Rushmore and Christ the Redeemer - and the London Eye is the latest in their worldwide project.

Time consuming: The cleaning project will take around three weeks to complete as only two or three pods can be cleaned a night

Large scale clean-up: Kärcher co-operated with the National Park Service to clean the presidents¿ heads on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota in 2005

Powerful: A team of approximately fifteen workers blasted near-boiling water onto the surface of the stone from five gas-powered pressure washers at the rate of 3000 gallons per day

Cleaning around the world: The company also cleaned Christ the Redeemer in in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the 1980s
