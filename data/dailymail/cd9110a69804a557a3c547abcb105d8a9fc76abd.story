Australia have made one change to the side that beat England for their final round-robin match in the Four Nations Series against Samoa in Wollongong on Sunday.

Sam Thaiday switches from prop to his normal slot in the second row to plug the gap created by injury to Beau Scott and Josh Papalii is given the number 10 shirt after starting on the bench in Melbourne.

Thaiday was used as a makeshift prop for the Kangaroos first two matches after regular front rowers Matt Scott, James Tamou and Paul Gallen were ruled out through injury or suspension.
