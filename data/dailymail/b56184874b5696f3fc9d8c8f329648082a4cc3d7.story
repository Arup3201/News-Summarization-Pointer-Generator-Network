This is the shocking moment a callous teenage carer was caught on camera stealing from a vulnerable pensioner's purse. 

Sheryvone Brooks was filmed reaching into a kitchen drawer at 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson's house in Stourbridge, Dudley. 

The 19-year-old's actions were caught on a camera installed by Mrs Nicholson's family who had noticed money going missing from the elderly woman's home.

Mrs Nicholson was said to be 'devastated' by the theft and would have given the teenager money if she had asked her for it, her son said 

Brooks, who worked for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley, was found guilty of theft at Wolverhampton Crown Court.  

In the video, the teenager is seen sitting in a chair in Mrs Nicholson's kitchen talking to another carer. 

She is filmed opening the drawer then looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her. 

The teenager then stood up, covering the brown leather purse with her body while she took out £30.  

The teenager then stuffed the money into the pocket of her hooded sweatshirt before returning the purse to the drawer

Mrs Nicholson's family said she had been left 'devastated' by the theft, and that she would have given money to the teenager had she asked for it. 

The teenager (seen leaving court) was fired from her job

Speaking after the case, the 85-year-old's son, Robert Smith told the Express and Star: 'She was devastated and it has affected her health.

'It's absolutely disgusting. It had happened a couple of times before at the end of last year, so I set up the camera on New Year's Day,' said Robert Smith, Mrs Nicholson's son. 

'I knew that we would catch the person but the video is still shocking.

'You are supposed to put your trust in carers but then one does something like this, and it destroys that trust.

'I hope she gets a severe sentence for what she has done. In total I think she took something close to £200 over three occasions.

'The video was taken first thing in the morning while the other carer was getting my mum out of bed.'

The court heard how Brooks said she needed the money to pay for Christmas presents when she committed the theft on January 6. 

She has since repaid the money, describing the incident as 'stupid and opportunistic'. 

Timothy Talbot-Webb, defending, said: 'She knew it was wrong.' 

While the sum of money stolen was 'minor', magistrates referred the case to crown court because of the breach of trust involved. 

Brooks, who has been fired from Gateway Heath and Social Care, will be sentenced next month.
