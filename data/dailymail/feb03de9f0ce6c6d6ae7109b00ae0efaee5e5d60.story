She was so incredibly fragile when she was born that any ordinary wrapping wouldn’t do.

Doctors put tiny Sophia Meechan in bubble wrap to keep her alive after she was born weighing just over a pound.

Her chances of survival were slim, but doctors wanted to give her the best possible chance.

And now their efforts to save her have all been worthwhile as little Sophia - nicknamed ‘Bub’ by her mother after the bubble wrap that kept her alive - has just started school.

Her mother, Rebecca, 39, a forensic scientist, said: ‘It was the most emotional day when Sofia started school for the first time.

‘I kept thinking of how far she has come - from being wrapped in bubble wrap to survive - to finally being able to start school.

‘I’ve called her Bub since the day she was born, because of the bubble wrap that saved her life.’

Sophia’s battle for survival began when her mother was just 24 weeks pregnant. She went into premature labour and was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed her with an incompetent cervix.

Miss Meechan, who lives in Cannock, Staffordshire, said: ‘My pregnancy had been complicated from the beginning. I started bleeding at seven weeks and thought that I was losing Sophia then.

‘She hung on until I got to 24 weeks pregnant. But then I went into labour and doctors diagnosed me with an incompetent cervix which meant I couldn’t hold my baby in my womb any longer.’

The doctors gave Miss Meechan steroid injections to try and develop her baby’s lungs.

She said: ‘I kept begging the doctors to listen to Sophia’s heartbeat to check she was still alive. I was terrified that she was going to die because she was being born so early.'

Sophia was delivered by caesarian, weighing just 1Ib8. Doctors warned Miss Meechan that her baby was unlikely to survive.

She
 said: ‘Her head was so tiny - it was the size of a boiled egg. She just
 lay there so small and fragile. I kept thinking how could something so 
small possibly survive.’

She
 was wrapped in bubble wrap for the first 24 hours of her life, but 
doctors didn’t know if she would even survive the night. Plastic 
wrapping is used by hospitals to help premature babies retain their body
 heat.

Sophia remained 
on a life support machine for 13 weeks. She then had an operation to 
close a valve in her heart, but complications meant that all her organs 
started to shut down.

Miss Meechan said: ‘That was the lowest point. I 
really thought that I was going to lose her, after all these weeks of 
fighting. The doctors told me she was struggling to survive. I had to 
make a choice whether to let her go or whether to let them try a drug to
 keep her alive. But it could leave her with cerebral palsy.

‘I held her and decided that I had to take the risk and let her have the drug.’

Amazingly Sophia hung on and then started to make a recovery without needing the drug.

Miss Meechan added: ‘No one could quite believe it. She had been so weak, yet she started to make a recovery without needing to have the drug after all. I was so proud of her.’

During her battle for survival she had to have 15 blood transfusions and had to be resuscitated a dozen times.

Miss Meechan said: 'When she put her school uniform on for the first time, I burst into tears'

Sophia was eventually allowed home from hospital after five months. At 12 months she underwent laser eye surgery as her retinas hadn’t developed properly due to her early birth.

Since then she has gone from strength to strength. And last month, aged four, she started school for the first time.

Miss Meechan said: ‘When she put her school uniform on for the first time, I burst into tears. I couldn’t believe that my bubble wrap baby was actually starting school. She has come on such a long journey.’

Miss Meechan has written a book about Sophia’s battle for survival called ‘My Bubble Wrap Girl - Sophia’s story - which is available on Amazon.

She said: ‘I wanted to give support to other mothers who may be in my position and show them that anything is possible.

‘My Bub is proof that something so tiny can survive and go on to live a normal life. She’s been through so much since the day she was born, but she’s fought through it all.’
