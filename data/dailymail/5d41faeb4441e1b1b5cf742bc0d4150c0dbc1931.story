A beloved Minneapolis school teacher tragically died in front of her class early Monday, leaving behind 10 bewildered students, two beautiful daughters, age 6 and 8, and a doting husband.

Lori Blomme, 40, was known as a teacher who inspired students 'to achieve beyond what they ever believed,' officials said, and the Menlo Park Academy has been devastated by the loss.

Mrs Blomme collapsed at the end of her third period class on Monday after she told her students that she felt faint.

'In the beginning of the day, she was the same old Lori -- a great smile on her face,' student Marshaun Williams, a sophomore in Blomme's class, said to Fox.

A few minutes later she collapsed, Marshaun said, and the ten confused students rushed for assistance.

'We didn't know what to do,' Marshaun said. 'She just said she was going to faint. We did the best thing we could do and get help.'

The group was rushed out to the gymnasium while paramedics tried to revive her. She passed away before her husband could say goodbye.

'She was a person who lived for what she could do for everybody,' said Blomme's brother-in-law, Rick Blomme, to Fox.

'Absolute unsung hero -- when they say love in a million, she definitely fit that bill.'

Officials have not identified her cause of death, only identifying it as a 'medical emergency.' Autopsy results are pending.

'In the morning of October 29, 2012, teacher Lori Blomme experienced a medical emergency in a classroom at Menlo Park Alternative High School and later passed away,' the Minneapolis Public Schools said in a statement.

'Menlo Park and MPS express condolences to Lori's family, friends, coworkers and students.'

'Lori was a committed and caring teacher who dedicated so much of herself to the Menlo Park school community,' said Helen Henly, the school's director, to the Star Tribune.

'She inspired and encouraged students to achieve beyond what they ever believed.'

Her students and family struggled to indentify a reason for her passing, pointing to the stresses of losing her beloved dog Queen.

'[Her daughters] were going door to door and passing out flyers and saying, "If you have my dog, please give us a call,"' family friend Gloria Tollefson told Fox.

The flyers, which are still posted all over the school, read 'Reward: Missing family member, small black and white dog' and show a photo of the adorable animal.

Late Wednesday night, the dog was returned - though the family's mourning process is far from over.

Mrs Blomme lived in south Minneapolis, often biking or walking to work, and is survived by her husband and two daughters, ages 6 and 8.

Her funeral has been scheduled for Friday morning at the Church of the Holy Name at 3637 11th Ave in South Minneapolis.

Her family has established fund in her name and donations can be made at any Wells Fargo Bank branch.

'She was the best teacher,' said former student Darrian Lenoir. 'I did my best to try and pass her class. I'm up there now, and I'm happy.'
