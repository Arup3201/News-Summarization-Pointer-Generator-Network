Britain has signed up to a Nato initiative to share billions of pounds of military hardware with other countries, potentially leaving the UK incapable of fighting its own wars, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Under the scheme, heavy weapons, aircraft and ships will be pooled in an effort to save money and promote co-operation.

But last night retired Air Vice Marshal Sir John Walker said military actions such as defending the Falkland Islands would be impossible if this country were sharing large quantities of vital equipment.

He said: 'If we intend to act alone, Britain simply has to have its own kit. Lending and borrowing on the scale being envisaged here isn't wise in the long term.'

British defence chiefs confirmed that they have signed up to the Lead Nation Procurement Initiative to permit 'flexible sharing' of equipment between the 28 countries of Nato – the security alliance set up after the Second World War. 

The scheme was launched earlier this month and is being run by a branch of the US military called the Defence Security Co-operation Agency.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Nato last night declined to disclose details about what assets Britain may share, but experts believe the UK could soon agree to let the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia use its top-secret Skynet 5 military satellite system.

And as Britain is without any sea patrol aircraft to protect its airspace from incursions by Russian jets, experts believe that a deal will be struck for the UK to borrow a fleet of specialist US planes.

Tanks, rockets, and heavy artillery may also be shared between countries as the scheme, which has begun with a two-year trial, is rolled out. Most will be manufactured in the US and sold to European states which then agree to share the equipment with their neighbours. 

It is understood Britain will benefit financially from any leasing arrangements when it buys kit which it then makes available to Nato partners for collective use.

But Sir John fears British security will be compromised by the scheme. He said: 'Britain cannot be continually lending and borrowing equipment which is vital to national security – not if we ever intend to act independently, as we would be required to if the security of the Falkland Islands were compromised.

'It smacks of defence on the cheap and it is sickening that it is being introduced at a time when Russia is increasing its military spending.'

Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said that although the scheme offered efficiencies, it was going down 'a tricky road'.

He added: 'The introduction of this scheme should not be used by Nato members, Britain included, as an excuse to further reduce defence spending.'

An MoD spokesman said last night: 'The UK will of course consider this opportunity along with all other procurement options on a case-by-case basis to ensure maximum value for money for the taxpayer.'
