John Kennedy believes Ronny Deila has turned a corner. After six months in Glasgow, the Norwegian is slowly beginning to look and sound like a Celtic manager.

No 3 in the first-team coaching set-up, former Parkhead central defender Kennedy was as in the dark about Deila as everyone else at first. He knew little or nothing about the man he was asked to work with.

Unheralded and unproven outwith Norwegian football, Deila seemed almost overwhelmed by the demands of his new job in those early days. A casual drink in a Glasgow pub at the end of the night became an ordeal. Posing for pictures became an invasive way of life. 

Ronny Deila has turned things around at Parkhead following a slow start

On the field, his system was unfamiliar to the players, results hinting at a lack of understanding between the manager and his charges.

As Christmas approaches, however, Celtic are three points clear at the top of the SPFL Premiership. The air of crisis has passed – for now - and Deila looks to be finding his feet.

They could always score more goals – notably so against Motherwell on Saturday. Yet, since a 1-0 home defeat by Hamilton in October, Celtic have now kept five clean sheets in seven league games.

‘Sometimes it looks as though it’s stuttering along and question marks start,’ said Kennedy. ‘But, in recent weeks, you can see a team that’s fully committed to what the manager is trying to do. Once you get that things can only move forward.’

Deila was named the SPFL Manager of the Month for November after four-straight wins

The ideas were radical at first. Deila brought many of his own fitness and analysis staff over from Norway. The diet was famously overhauled and sports scientist Jim McGuiness was promoted to the first team.

The blunt truth is that some still don’t care for this stuff. A change of culture and philosophy is an unsettling business and some of the existing staff and players will inevitably leave because they haven’t bought into it. For his part, Kennedy is convinced by the changes made so far.

‘Ronny was new to me, as well, when he came in,’ he continued. ‘Initially, he was finding his feet, and the thing that catches people off guard is the magnitude and size of the club, the focus that’s on them every day.

‘He’s certainly settled in, he’s the right type of character for this type of job and he has all the players on board for where he wants to go.

‘I think we’re beginning to see more and more of that. At first, it’s always the same - a new manager with new ideas and things take time.

‘He hasn’t changed his style in the dressing room. He can be heated when he wants to be and really enthusiastic when he wants to but generally he’s very calm and thoughtful about what he’s trying to do.

‘He doesn’t get too worked up and he makes sure that when the players go out on the pitch, whether that be before the match or at half-time, he’s very clear about what he wants. That’s very important.’

There are times, most notably after away victories, when Deila does become worked up.

Deila has developed a bond with Celtic supporters after his post-match fist-pumping displays

After the 1-0 win over Motherwell on Saturday, the Celtic coach indulged in another of the first pumping displays of bonding with the travelling support which have become his new practice.

If it seems a little forced at times, there is method in his actions. The supporters like to see a manager – especially an outsider – display passion for their club.

‘You obviously also have to have the character and everything else to drive the players on, which he’s got, but at the right time he’s got a calm head to make sure that he is clear in his instructions,’ said Kennedy.

‘From my perspective, it’s been a fantastic learning curve working under him. He is very specific in what he wants from us all and he certainly makes sure that in training every day he drums it into the players what he wants on pitch at match time.

‘It has probably taken time but certainly from my perspective we’re beginning to see that.’

The process of change has not all been one way. An idealist at heart, Deila began life as Celtic manager with a dogged attitude to how his teams should play the game.

The 4-2-3-1 formation has never altered – he won’t change that – but there is an acceptance now that he will only be given the time to change things if he is winning games.

Altering a culture while carving out results is a tricky balancing act. Thursday’s Europa League game with Dinamo Zagreb – Celtic are already in the last 32 - offers a rare opportunity to try things without having to win the match.

And yet, still, people will expect a performance and result of an acceptable standard. For Deila, this has been the biggest lesson of all at Parkhead.

‘Winning is the big thing at Celtic,’ added Kennedy. ‘If you go two matches without winning all of a sudden the question marks come out - but that’s the nature of the beast and that will never change.

‘When you are the manager or a player, you just have to have the mentality to deal with that and that’s something he knows about now. He’s well aware that when we don’t play well just make sure you still win the match.

‘Performance-wise, you want to win with style - but when that style doesn’t come across in a specific game just make sure you win it and move on.’
