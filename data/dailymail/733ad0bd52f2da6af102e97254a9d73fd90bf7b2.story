Life after Wilfried Bony didn't start well for Swansea City after they were humiliated 5-0 by Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium. 

Oscar and Diego Costa both scored first half braces before Andre Schurrle added a fifth as Garry Monk's side capitulated in worrying fashion.

Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. 

Swansea City's players look dejected during a first-half performance that saw them concede four times

SWANSEA CITY (4-4-2)

Lukasz Fabianski - 5

A good save to deny Eden Hazard in the second half and not directly implicated for any of the goals, but how much positive feedback can you take from a 5-0 defeat? 

Dwight Tiendalli - 4 

Never got close to controlling Hazard.

Federico Fernandez - 4

Horrendous backpass for Chelsea’s third. The low point of a poor performance.

Ashley Williams - 4.5 

Won headers and fought hard but failed to lift or organise an outclassed defence.

Ashley Williams attempts to block Oscar's shot but it evades both him and Lukasz Fabianski and goes in

Neil Taylor - 4.5 

Part of a poor defensive unit. Could have been stronger in the tackle in the build up to Chelsea’s fifth.

Nathan Dyer - 4 

Barely got a sniff of the ball.

Tom Carroll - 4

Got tangled up in first-goal mess and over-run thereafter. Midfield needed bodies so he looked as though he was on a hiding to nothing. 

Gylfi Sigurdsson - 5

Lose pass let Chelsea in for opener before hitting the bar.

Wayne Routledge - 5.5

Lacked service before injuring his calf while misplaying a pass after 32 minutes. 

Nelson Oliveira - 4.5 

Loan signing looked quick but generally ineffective. Came short to try to find possession but Swansea couldn’t hold on to ball long enough to supply it.

Bafetimbi Gomis - 5

He will have easier games in his effort to prove himself as a replacement for Wilfried Bony. Tried hard but with no service what can you do? 

Subs: Marvin Emnes for Routledge (32, 5.5), Fulton for Oliveira (66, 5), Modou Barrow for Dyer (74).

Not used: Tremmel, Rangel, Amat, Bartley.

Garry Monk - 4

Two men up front meant an overrun midfield. That said, not sure a wall would have kept Chelsea out.

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Petr Cech - 6

Poor guy hasn’t had much playing time this season so you have to feel for him when he gets a game but nothing to do. Looked bored. 

Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5

Nothing to do defensively but, as always, a surging presence down the right flank. Hard as nails and subtle when he needed to be, such as the touch and pass to create Chelsea’s fifth. 

Gary Cahill - 6

Won a couple of first-half headers and sat back and enjoyed the game. 

John Terry - 6

See Cahill.

Former Barcelona and Arsenal midfielder Fabregas is challenged by Oliveira during the second half

Filipe Luis - 6

Got forward well but not much to do defensively. 

Nemanja Matic - 7

Along with Fabregas, he controlled the middle of the pitch, which is where the match was won. A superb player.

Cesc Fabregas - 7.5

All roads pass through him – he sets the tempo and plots the routes. Big part of the group that made the second.

Willian - 7.5

Always moving, often incisive and helped make the fourth with lovely run and shot. Two efforts against the woodwork.

Oscar - 8.5 

Lovely finish from 25 yards for first and equally clinical for second. The creative spark of a wonderfully impressive performance.

Eden Hazard - 7

Forced save after 19 minutes and teed up good chance for Fabregas early in second half. Effective without being the main threat. 

Diego Costa - 8

Two goals and an assist. What a magnificent signing. 

Subs: Loic Remy for Costa (74, 6), Ramires for Fabregas (74, 6), Andre Schurrle for Willian (76).

Subs not used: Courtois, Zouma, Mikel, Salah.

Jose Mourinho - 7

Overloaded midfield and was rewarded.

Jonathan Moss - 6.5

No bookings and surely no outcry from two referee-baiting managers.
