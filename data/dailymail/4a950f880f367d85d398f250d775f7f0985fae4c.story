AA patrolmen are now being trained as plumbers under new plans which could see them unblocking toilets when they are not jump starting cars.

It is part of a trial which was launched in Northern Ireland over summer.

The scheme aims to boost the AA’s home repair service, and could be rolled out across the UK following a trial over the summer in Northern Ireland.

But the move has been branded a cost-cutting exercise by unions.

Plumbing patrol: AA patrolmen are being trained as plumbers to boost their home repair service

The plan comes after reports that AA, one of Britain’s best known brands, could soon be up for sale for about £5 billion.

Acromas, owner of the 107-year-old 
motoring organisation, has appointed accountants Ernst & Young to 
look at options for the sale which is not expected to start until early 
next year.

Patrols as plumbers has the potential to be introduced in other parts of the UK, Operations Manager Keith Munns said.

According to The Sun, an internal memo from Mr Munns said: ‘We have trained up a number of roadside patrols to carry out basic plumbing activity.

‘By the time we get to winter we will
know whether that has worked and it may well be that we have rolled 
that out a little bit further.’

The plumbers training is designed to 
strengthen AA’s Home Emergency Repair service which launched two years 
ago promising ‘trusted and skilled tradesmen’ that can fix leaks, burst 
pipes and toilets in the home.

But Paul Grafton of GMB union said: ‘This is all about money.’

Earlier this month, the company 
announced that they expected more than 400 jobs to be lost at the AA 
call centre in Cardiff, blaming the rise in online transactions.

Some 3,000 staff left the company in 2004 during the restructure of AA when it was sold by Centrica, the company that runs British Gas, to CVC and Permira.

Acromas was then formed in 2007 when the AA 
merged with Saga, an over-50s insurance, financial services, holidays and healthcare specialist. Since then, the AA has grown 
from around 7,000 to 8,500 employees.

The Automobile Association (AA) formed in 1905 when a group of motoring enthusiasts met at the Trocadero restaurant in London’s West End. The group initially intended to champion the motorist’s cause and help drivers avoid police speed traps.

The AA’s 100 members in 1905 grew to 83,000 by 1914.

The first AA patrols used basic pedal cycles and had no uniforms. They patrolled Brighton and Portsmouth roads where their official duties were ‘indicating dangers on the road and helping motorists who had broken down’.

In 1907 the first AA insurance policy was launched and by 1912 AA was inspecting and classifying hotels.

The AA then opened the first roadside filling station in 1920 at Aldermaston in Berkshire and by 1932 they opened ten more.

With the introduction of the two-way radio after WWII, the night-time breakdown service was launched in 1949.

In 1950 the AA hit the one million members milestone.

An advertising campaign in the 1990s branded the AA the fourth emergency service.

The AA joined the Centrica group, the company that runs British Gas, in a £1.1billion acquisition in 1999 before its acquisition by private equity firms CVC and Permira for £1.75billion.
