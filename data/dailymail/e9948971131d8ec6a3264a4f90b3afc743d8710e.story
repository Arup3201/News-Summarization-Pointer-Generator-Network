Cause of death: Grand Valley State University quarterback Cullen Finnerty, 30, died in the Michigan wilderness of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit

A former college football star who disappeared in the Michigan wilderness during a fishing trip died of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit and had a degenerative brain disease made worse by painkillers, it was revealed Thursday.

An updated autopsy report said Cullen Finnerty's anxiety and paranoia in the woods the night of May 26 may have been exacerbated by an ‘elevated’ level of oxycodone and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - the brain disease that has been found in a number of ex-football players.

Finnerty's brain was studied at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, which said Thursday the severity of CTE was moderate and it's ‘highly unlikely’ the disease alone led to his death.

‘CTE possibly affected his judgment, insight and behavior, but there are other factors, including the use of medications prescribed by his doctor, that most likely contributed to the circumstances surrounding his death,’ the center said in a statement.

Kent County Chief Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle said Finnerty, 30, became incapacitated before inhaling his vomit in Lake County 65 miles north of Grand Rapids.

Though relatives reported the former Grand Valley State University quarterback had a number of alcoholic drinks the day he died, Cohle said his blood-alcohol level was ‘negligible’ and didn't contribute to Finnerty's incapacitation.

The report said it's likely Finnerty had anxiety, disorientation and paranoia from being alone in the woods while waiting for in-laws to pick him up. Cohle said the pain medication was prescribed to Finnerty for back injuries likely sustained during his football career.

Concerned: Finnerty (pictured with his wife) last spoke to a family 
member May 26 in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous 
about something'

Finnerty's father, Tim Finnerty, said 
that his son also was taking a thyroid medication at the time of his 
death, and the family is concerned high doses could have caused him to 
become sick and confused.

‘None
of this [news] is going to bring Cullen back,’ Mr Finnerty said. ‘The 
only people that will know what happened will be Cullen and God.’

An
initial autopsy conducted the morning after Finnerty's body was found 
determined that he had a ‘slightly enlarged heart and slightly cloudy 
lungs’ but ‘no trauma to the body at all.’

The final report includes toxicology results and the determination that he had CTE.

Boston
University's center for study of the disease reported in December that 
34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football
suffered from CTE.

Personal struggles: Finnerty's wife, Jennifer, told investigators that her husband had had 'paranoid' episodes in the past

The 
NFL faces lawsuits by thousands of former players who say the league 
withheld information on the harmful effects of concussions. The NCAA 
also is being sued over its handling of head injuries.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia.

Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. 

Tim
Finnerty, who coached football for 35 years, said it's important to 
keep researching CTE and possible links to injuries not only in football
but hockey, soccer and others sports. But he said the life lessons and 
benefits of playing football are ‘substantial.’

Finnerty's
wife, Jennifer, told investigators that he had a past addiction to 
painkillers but had not taken any drugs since spending time in rehab 
more than a year earlier, adding that it wasn't the first time he had a 
‘paranoid’ episode.

Instead
of driving home from Detroit a year-and-a-half earlier, he took off for
Grand Rapids in western Michigan due to fears the FBI would follow him,
she said. She said her husband remained in a state of panic for four to
five days.

Cullen 
Finnerty, his brother-in-law Matt Brinks and father-in-law Dan Brinks 
went fishing the night of May 26. The Brinks dropped off Finnerty around
8.30pm and watched as he boarded a small personal inflatable pontoon 
boat and floated downstream.

The
plan was for the Brinks to pick up Finnerty in about 30 minutes, but as
it turned out, it was the last time they would see him alive. His body 
was found May 28 within a mile of where he had disappeared.

Growing problem: Boston University's center for study of the disease reported in December that 34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE - the same disease that Finnerty had

In two brief phone conversations with family members, Mr Finnerty sounded disoriented and complained of being tailed.

His body was found May 28 at about 8pm in woods within a mile of where he disappeared, said Lake County Undersheriff Dennis Robinson.

He said the body was not in the water and was found in a wooded area in Webber Township, near the family's cottage.

The search drew scores of police and volunteers, including staff and players from Grand Valley State.

Finnerty last spoke to a family member that night in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous about something.'

Based on that call, the family suspected 'he might be having some kind of a mental episode - that he was either afraid or something and ran off into the woods,' Hilts said.

The sheriff said authorities had been tracking Finnerty's cellphone 'until it went dead.' The terrain made the search for the 6-foot-3, 230-pound ex-athlete difficult, Hilts said.

Searchers from the sheriff's office, state police and area fire departments fanned out Tuesday across a square-mile area of Webber Township, which is about 65 miles north of Grand Rapids.

Champion: Finnerty, 30, who had played at Grand Valley State University, led the team to three Division II national titles and more than 50 wins

In addition, dozens of current and former Grand Valley State players, coaches and staff hopped on a bus and headed north to Lake County to lend a hand in the search effort.

Grand Valley coach Matt Mitchell, who was a defensive assistant when Finnerty led the Lakers to national titles in 2005 and 2006, as well as former Grand Valley coach and current Notre Dame offensive coordinator Chuck Martin were among those helping out.

Finnerty, who starred at Brighton High School, originally accepted an offer to play at the University of Toledo but transferred to Grand Valley after redshirting in 2001.

The dual-threat QB played for Grand Valley teams that won Division II titles in 2003, 2005 and 2006, and he briefly was a member of the Baltimore Ravens.

Mitchell said Finnerty was 'held in very high regard. He was the starting quarterback on national championship teams. But he's more than that: He's one of the most loyal teammates we've ever had.'

He is survived by his wife and two small children.
