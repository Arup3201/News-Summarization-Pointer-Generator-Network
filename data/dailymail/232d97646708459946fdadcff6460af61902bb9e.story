With the likes of Kim Kardashian and Miranda Kerr constantly parading their perfect posteriors on social media, it comes as little surprise that body conscious beach-goers are spending nearly $500 (£300) on a new treatment that promises to enhance their derrieres.

Make way for the 'butt facial' - the latest beauty craze to come out of New York. The costly 40-minute procedure uses lasers, chemical peels and moisturisers to tone and smooth the skin.

Judith Liriano, 21, had the procedure done to rid her bottom of cellulite, dimples, and dark spots and she couldn't be happier with the results.

Would you pay that much? Judith Liriano poses at the beach after getting her £300 butt facial - a new treatment that promises to enhance your bottom

Speaking about the treatment, Judith said: 'Every girl wants to feel confident when they're on the beach - before I tried the booty facial, I wasn't as confident as I am now. I don't think you could put a price tag on looking good and feeling good.

'I feel great, I love the results - my butt looks better, it's has an even colour, is more toned, and feels so much firmer than it did before.' 

The procedure, named the 'Tip Top Tush Treatment' is available at Dr. Matthew Schulman's plastic surgery office in New York City.

First, a special exfoliating scrub is massaged onto the bottom to rid it of dead skin. Then a laser treatment with radio frequency follows, smoothing and contouring the skin before a special firming moisturiser is applied when the laser is finished.

Aesthetician Amanda Sanzone performs the procedure and says it is becoming increasingly popular among New Yorkers.

Amanda said: 'The butt facial has become a lot more popular recently - we treat the skin on our faces, we treat the skin on our necks, our hands.

'But especially with summer here and bikini season here, a lot of women, and sometimes even men, want to treat the skin on their butts.

It was worth it then! Speaking after her procedure, Judith said: 'I feel great, I love the results - my butt looks better, it's has an even colour, is more toned, and feels so much firmer than it did before'

Will it catch on? Esthetician Amanda Sanzone performs the procedure and says it is becoming increasingly popular among New Yorkers because it helps boost their confidence

'In today's culture, people are taking more pictures and taking group shots and noticing problems on their butt or thighs that they never noticed before.

'This treatment is very important - a lot of people are self conscious about the skin on their butts.

'Whether it's acne or cellulite, it's definitely a treatment that can help boost self-confidence and make you feel really comfortable in a bikini.'

Amanda said one can expect the best results after three to six treatments depending on skin type.

Priceless: Judith said: 'Every girl wants to feel confident when they're on the beach - before I tried the booty facial, I wasn't as confident as I am now. I don't think you could put a price tag on looking good and feeling good'

The treatment is slowly seeping its way into the UK with EF MEDISPA in London offering the treatment.

Esther Fieldgrass, who owns the spa, 
said: ‘As they spend the majority of the year hidden away in clothes, 
our bottoms don't get the care and attention they deserve, with many of 
us often neglecting this area from our skincare routine altogether.

‘Combine
 this with desk jobs, tight underwear that causes friction and traps 
sweat against the skin, and tiny hair follicles which can become 
blocked, and you have the perfect recipe for a spotty bottom.’

Is it all her fault? Kim Kardashian caused a stir when she took to Twitter to 
reveal her post-baby body in all its glory in a revealing white 
swimsuit, sparking the Belfie trend
