Fans will be able to sip tea Laura Carmichael or even eat with her at London's Criterion restaurant

Taking tea with a member of the Crawley family would be a thrill for any true fan of Downton Abbey. And now devotees of the hit ITV drama can do just that – for the princely sum of £4,500.

Laura Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith in the series, is offering the public the chance to win a string of Downton-related prizes in a new charity campaign.

In addition to joining Laura for cucumber sandwiches and a cup of Earl Grey or Darjeeling, other prizes include a personal etiquette session with Lady Edith via Skype for £1,500, and a period silver tea set signed by the cast for £900.

And for a £6 donation, fans can enter a draw to visit the Downton set and win dinner with Laura at the Criterion Restaurant in London.

Money raised will go to support the umbrella organisation Haiti: Make Births Safe. It was set up recently to ensure the health of mothers and children on the Caribbean island, which was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010.

An estimated 200,000 people died in the tremor, thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed, and hospitals and schools were also reduced to rubble.

Laura visited the island last year with members of the Kent-based charity The Haiti Hospital Appeal, which forms part of Haiti: Make Births Safe. She said: ‘It was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences of my life.

‘Having the opportunity to meet some of the amazing Haitian doctors who are doing so much, under such difficult circumstances, was incredibly moving and inspiring.

‘Many people associate my connection with Haiti and the maternity care situation around the story in Downton Abbey where my on-screen sister, Lady Sybil, died in childbirth from eclampsia. In Haiti, eclampsia is still a major risk, and still tragically takes many lives.’

She added: ‘The few doctors there are doing all they can to ease the situation. Seeing their passion was the real inspiration.’

So far more than £15,000 has been raised through the competition, and the campaign is hoping to  reach its £60,000 target by the time entries close next month. Laura said: ‘We would love people to get behind this. For one of the prizes, I’ll be showing people around the set at Highclere Castle, introducing them to the cast, and taking them out for dinner at the Criterion Restaurant, where we filmed some of last series.’

The money raised by the sale will go to aid work in Haiti, which is still suffering nearly four years after a massive earthquake rocked the country, claiming 200,000 lives and destroying infrastructre

Laura is not the first Downton star to use her profile to raise money from devotees. Elizabeth McGovern, who plays her mother, the Countess of Grantham, also offered various incentives for fans to support her band, Sadie & the Hotheads, including a 15-minute video conversation on Skype for £50.

The fifth series of Downton Abbey is being filmed and is due to be broadcast in the autumn.
