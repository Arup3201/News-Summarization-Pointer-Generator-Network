An FBI agent who authored a highly sensitive FBI interrogation manual submitted the document for copyright protection - making it available at the Library of Congress for anyone with a library card to read.

The inexplicable mistake has been reported by Mother Jones journalist Nick Baumann who viewed the document, which was written in 2008 and submitted for copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office in 2010.

Baumann reports that the filing is baffling for several reasons, not least that any member of the public can read the document that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) fought for years to gain access to.

Publicly available: The FBI interrogation manual has been available for any member of the public to read at the Library of Congress since 2010

The FBI did eventually provide the ACLU with a copy of the interrogation guidebook in 2012, but it was heavily redacted, reports Mother Jones, with whole pages blacked out. Unlike the very similar version which has been sitting in the Library of Congress since 2010.

In addition, the 70-page manual is a 
secret government document and government documents cannot be 
copyrighted: Anything 'prepared by an officer or employee of the United 
States government as part of that person's official duties' is not 
subject to copyright in the United States.

'A
 document that has not been released does not even need a copyright,' 
Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of 
American Scientists told Mother Jones.

'Who is going to plagiarize from it? Even if you wanted to, you couldn't violate the copyright because you don't have the document. It isn't available.'

Calling the copyright filing 'a comedy of errors,' Aftergood says it seems to be the result of 'gross incompetence and ignorance.'

According to Mother Jones, agent who 
authored the manual and then filed it for copyright is an FBI 
supervisory special agent who once worked as a unit chief in the FBI's 
counter-terrorism division.

He registered the work under his own name, effectively claiming rights for the document for himself and not for the FBI.

Baumann
 was able to compare the document obtained by the ACLU with the 
unredacted FBI manual and find out what the blacked out parts in the 
ACLU version might have contained.

'A redacted sentence in the manual says the document is intended for use by the FBI's "clean" teams - investigators who collect information intended for use in federal prosecutions,' writes Baumann.

'That raises the question of whether teams collecting information that's not for use in federal courts would have to follow the manual's (already permissive) guidelines at all.'

Experts are baffled at the security lapse and why the officer believed the secret document needed copyright protection at all

The manual doesn't even qualify for copyright because it is a government document
