A lot of Brits would have been stumbling for an early morning kebab on Bank Holiday Monday - but one man was more eager than the rest - and ended up ploughing his car right through the front of a takeaway shop.

The hapless motorist, 29, lost control of his Ford Fiesta and crashed backwards through the window of Flames fast food outlet in Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs at around 8am.

After clambering from the wreckage showered with glass, he then told stunned witnesses: 'I better call my mum'. 

Aw shish! The hapless driver lost control of his car before ending up back-first through the takeaway window

The man was arrested at the scene. A police spokesman said: 'He was held on suspicion of failing to provide a roadside breath test sample and obstructing a constable in execution of his duty.

'He was bailed to return to a police station at a later date.' 

Staff  put on a brave face after discovering the car parked right through the window of their shop - by joking the driver must have been hungry for a snack.

Nidal Mansour, who works at Flames, said: 'I saw a picture of a car inside the takeaway on the internet and I thought it was a fake so I went down to have a look.

'I don't understand how the car managed to reverse into the shop. It fitted exactly through the window.

A smashing meal: The car fit perfectly through the front window of the Smallthorne, Staffs fast food outlet

'The front is now boarded up so I don't think we will have to close. It will take a bit of cleaning up but we can still serve food.

'We thought it was quite funny and said that he must have been hungry.'

Leaflet deliveryman Matthew Houghton, 30, said he felt lucky to be alive after the vehicle smashed through the window just seconds before he walked past the takeaway.

'I heard a noise as if a car was bouncing off the kerb,' he said.

'I looked up and saw a Fiesta swerving all over the pace. It must have clipped the lamppost because I saw the light in the middle of the road.

'It started doing a 360-degree turn, spinning out, and as he levelled out, his back end swung round across the road, and went straight through the takeaway and there was a big smash.

'I couldn't believe it because it came out of nowhere.

'I watched it happening right in front of me and it felt like it was in slow motion.

Business as usual: The window has been boarded up and the takeaway is able to stay open despite the crash

'The driver got out of the car and I ran over. He was obviously worried and started swearing.

'He said he couldn't believe what had happened and that he better ring his mum.

'If it had happened 30 seconds later I would have been outside of Flames when he drove through it. '

Witness Peat Mueller, 67, who was driving past at the time, added: 'I was driving along Ford Green Road and my son noticed it at first - it was an unusual thing to see.

'The car was parked backwards inside the takeaway and the window was smashed It's quite amazing.'

The driver only suffered minor injuries, and a spokesman for Staffordshire Police confirmed nobody else was hurt during the incident.

He said: 'We were called out to a single road traffic collision in Ford Green Road, in Smallthorne, at 8.06am.

'A vehicle had collided with a building shop window. There was no major structural damage to the premises.

'An investigation by the local policing team is ongoing.'
