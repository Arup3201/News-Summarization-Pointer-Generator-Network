Witty: Father-of-four John Lewis, computing academic of Virgina, tweeted one person: 'I am amazing, and not just at Christmas. Though perhaps you were referring to the retail store.'

One’s a British department store gearing up for Christmas with a huge advertising campaign – the other is an American computing professor.

Guess which John Lewis was contacted by the public to say they loved the £7million seasonal commercial?

Step forward Mr Lewis of Blacksburg, Virginia – who now has 4,500 followers on Twitter after the advertisment premiered in the UK on Saturday night.

The US academic uses the Twitter identity John Lewis@John Lewis – for which he bought the rights before the store chain – ensuring that he bore the brunt of the messages from customers.

But instead of blowing a fuse, he has been unfailingly polite to the thousands who have mistakenly contacted him via the social networking site, earning him praise online as ‘the most patient and polite man on the internet’.

Store bosses last night promised to send a gift to thank the professor for redirecting people to the correct Twitter page, which is @johnlewisretail.

Mr Lewis, a father of four children aged seven to 14, said: ‘So many people use the internet and Twitter to say vile things. I’m quite happy to be known for a polite reply.’

In response to one query from a Twitter user called @richardbarley, he replies with subtle humour: ‘I am amazing, and not just at Christmas. Though perhaps you were referring to the retail store.’

Following another admiring message from a pair of users, he responds: ‘I am a perfect combination of those things, but you probably meant the retail store.’

Some even wrote back to compliment Mr Lewis on his ‘charming, witty work’. One, Maree Morgan said: ‘All these tweets that he receives from people thinking it’s the store and he responds with such wit.’

Another, @artichokebistro added: ‘Retail, who cares! What’s your story?’ Among those who got a personal reply was former BBC arts correspondent Rosie Millard, who also thought she was contacting the department store.

Mr Lewis, 50, who writes university and school text books on computer science, had heard of his namesake store following visits to the UK. He has also seen the new commercial online and, like millions of others, was charmed by the tale of a hare and a hibernating bear.

Until Saturday night, he only had 500 Twitter followers – and the occasional erroneous message from customers of the store.

Now he has lost count of the number of tweets he has received about  the hugely popular animated promotion.

He has replied to ‘almost all’ of them – often with an injection of wit – but his family find it ‘amusing’ that he spends so much time responding.

‘I don’t know how they will feel if I keep it up until Christmas,’ said Mr Lewis. ‘We shall have to see, but I know I will always be polite.’
