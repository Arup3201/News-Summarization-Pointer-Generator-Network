Men want to be him, women want to bed him... and now it seems Daniel Craig has also got style everyone wants a piece of too.

After the actor wore Tom Ford's Marko sunglasses in his third outing as James Bond in Skyfall demand soared. Now, following the releases of the movie on DVD, sales have rocketed by 80 per cent.

Luxury online retailer Myoptique.com have seen a vast increase 
in sales of the stylish frame and is currently selling over 100 pairs per week, with 
stock being replenished on a daily basis.

Trendsetter: Daniel Craig as James bond in his Tom Ford Marko sunglasses

The real deal: The Tom Ford Marko sunglasses Daniel Craig wore

Prices start at £228 and the Marko has quickly become a modern day classic thanks to its association with 007.

The simple but strong silhouette suits both men and women wanting to nab a slice of the suave spy's style.

It's not just sunglasses that Bond is setting trends with either.

Following on from the success of the blue trunks he wore in Casino Royal, which saw the La Perla budgie-smuggler style become a huge hit - and the actual trunks sell for £44,450 at auction - the 44-year-old actor looks set to start a new swimwear trend.

In one scene of Skyfall he echoes his performance in his first Bond film as he hits the screen wearing a pair of £125 light blue Orlebar Brown Setter swimming shorts.

Setting trends: Daniel Craig wears the Setter trunks by Orlebar Brown for return as James Bond in this picture from Skyfall

Longer and looser than the budgie-smuggling GrigioPerla style from Casino Royale, the shorts are cut midway on the thigh and show off Daniel's muscular physique to perfection - whilst being a touch more wearable than the tighter trunks.

Bond is in good company too: other male stars who are fans of Orlebar Brown include the very well-toned  rugby starThom Evans, actors Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds, and footballer Jamie Redknapp.
