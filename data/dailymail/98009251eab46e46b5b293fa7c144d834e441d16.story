Shocked swimmers found nine baby crocodiles in their pool after pranksters dumped them in the water causing one of the animals to die.

The baby freshwater crocodiles were found swimming in the Mount Isa Aquatics pool yesterday.

But the heat scorching heat proved to be too much for one of the reptiles and it died last night.

Caught out: It is the second time crocodiles have been caught in the pool after a one metre fresh water reptile was discovered in the pool in 2010

It is the second time crocodiles have been caught in the pool after a one metre fresh water reptile was discovered in the pool in 2010.

Six baby freshwater crocodiles ranging 
from 20-30cm, were found yesterday with the other three found 
hiding under tables and behind roller doors throughout the day in temperatures of 39C.

Pool director Brian Rodriquez told Townsville Bulletin it was a surprise to find when they opened the pool for business

'We had just opened the pool and a lap swimmer said they didn't want to alarm me but there was a small crocodile swimming beside them in the pool,' he said.

'I jumped in with the pool scoop to get him out but then there were two, then three, then four and five.

It is not every day you find little crocodiles swimming around.'

But since then one of the young crocodiles has died after being found in the scorching sun.

Reptile handler Gavin Lawrence said what started as a harmless prank ended up killing one of the reptiles.

'It’s annoying they’ve dumped them in the pool,' he told The North West Star.

'The chlorine is no good for them and at the end of the day it’s sort of reckless.'

Mrs Rodriquez said she suspected the baby crocodile succumbed to the heat.

Mr Rodriquez said he believed the reptiles were dumped in the pool by a group of pranksters.

He said CCTV footage showed a group of people loitering out the front shortly before the crocs were spotted in the water.

Mr Rodriquez evacuated the pool while he madly tried to catch the four-week-old creatures.

'Some of them were quite fast and didn't want to be caught,' he said.

'It was quite entertaining actually, only because nobody got hurt.'

The remaining reptiles were put in a tank and kept at the pool overnight.

They were tadpoles for dinner last night and tonight Mr Lawrence will safely release them at Moondarra Lake when it gets dark.
