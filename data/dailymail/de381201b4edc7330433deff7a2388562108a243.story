As many as 10,000 patients a year are dying due to poor NHS care, the head of the health service watchdog has warned.

David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission, said standards across the country were ‘dangerously variable’.

He said there were anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 avoidable deaths a year in hospitals alone, not counting those which occur due to failings by GPs.

David Prior, chair of the Care Quality Commission warned that NHS standards were 'dangerously variable' 

Mr Prior, who took up his post in January 2013, said the NHS must change its culture to ensure there is ‘no hiding place’ for inadequate doctors. The watchdog is currently carrying out spot checks on every GP surgery, hospital and care home in England – which could lead to the worst being shut down. It has promised the inspections will be more rigorous than before and each organisation will be given an Ofsted-style rating of ‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘needs improvement’ or ‘inadequate’.

Mr Prior, a former Tory MP and party chairman, said: ‘Standards of care are highly variable, sometimes dangerously so.

‘We have some outstanding hospitals, we have some inadequate hospitals. And the variation in primary care between different GP practices is probably even greater.

‘This variation matters, not just because many patients receive poor care, indeed many thousands die avoidably every year. No one knows how many, but in hospitals it has been estimated to be anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 – not a statistic that any other area of human activity would be happy with.’

Writing in The Guardian, he added: ‘Variation strikes at the heart of the NHS and its core principle that everyone should receive good quality care free at the point of delivery. In fact they do not.’

The CQC has already published its findings for the first 40 hospital trusts to be inspected and five were rated inadequate – one in eight.

A study in the BMJ in 2012 warned that up to 5 per cent of all hospital deaths were avoidable, the equivalent of 12,000 a year in England.

It is not the first time Mr Prior has spoken out about failings in the health service. Last year, he warned the NHS had been allowed to become so powerful under Labour that nobody dared criticise it.

He also attacked his own organisation, saying in the past there had been a culture of ‘incompetence’, ‘suppression’ and ‘oppression’.

Responding to Mr Prior’s comments on avoidable deaths, a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘For too long poor care in the NHS was swept under the carpet which resulted in the tragedy we saw at Mid Staffs under the last Labour government.

‘The role of the CQC and the new chief inspectors is to root out poor care wherever they find it without fear or favour.’

Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer at NHS England, said: ‘The overwhelming majority of our patients receive great care from staff who are pulling out all the stops.

‘We do need to do more, but the quality of care is better now than at any point in the history of the NHS.’
