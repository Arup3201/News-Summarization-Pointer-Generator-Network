Some call it the Angel of the West; others deride it as the Belly of the South.

But, whether they like it or loathe it, the people of Ilfracombe are now the custodians of this giant Damien Hirst sculpture – and they’ll be looking at it for the next two decades.

The 25-ton bronze statue of a heavily pregnant woman holding a sword, arrived in the Devon seaside resort yesterday on a flatbed trailer.

Dropping in: Damien Hirst's bronze statue of a pregnant woman, called Verity, has arrived in Ilfracombe, Devon

Huge: The statue is to be placed on the harbour front and stands at 65ft and weighs over 25 tonnes

Hundreds of residents came out to 
catch their first glimpse of the work, which will take more than a week 
to assemble and install.

Fans call it a ‘modern allegory of truth and 
justice’, but many townsfolk say it is ‘obscene and disgusting’.

On one side the woman’s skin is peeled
 back, revealing her skull, muscles and foetus – bringing accusations 
that the work is grotesque.

It wasn’t long after it arrived that 
residents took to the internet to voice their opinions. One said: 
‘Whatever did Ilfracombe do to deserve this?’

Another added: ‘Why did he
 have to make her naked? Pregnant women wear clothes most of the time.’

A third said: ‘Melt  it down and get 
Anthony Gormley to create a suitable sculpture for Ilfracombe, where 
families spend their holidays.’

Complaints: Some local residents are upset about Verity, calling her obscene and claiming she could encourage teenage pregnancy

Crowds: Fascinated people stand and watch as the bronze figure arrived on a huge lorry

Gormley’s 66ft Angel of the North was erected in the North-East in 1998.

Hirst’s 65ft statue, called Verity, 
has been loaned to the local authority by the artist for 20 years and 
will stand by the town’s pier.

Dozens  wrote to the council to object, 
with one saying it would ‘encourage teenage pregnancies’.

Another said it was ‘demeaning to 
women’ while a third claimed it was ‘eccentricity posturing as art’.

Resident Jenny Cookson was rather  more blunt: ‘It is a monstrosity,’ 
she said. Councillors say the statue will boost tourism and improve the 
town’s image.

Verity’s frame is a single piece of 
stainless steel.

The bronze exterior was cast in more than 40 pieces  
while the sword and upper arm are made from a single piece of glass 
fibre reinforced polymer.
