Georgina Bloomberg has introduced her baby to horseracing by taking the newborn to a Florida equestrian center.

Georgina, 31, gave birth to her son Jasper Michael Brown Quintana on Christmas Eve in New York City but the baby has already become a jetsetter.

Georgina was spotted cradling the little boy alongside her boyfriend, the boy's father Ramiro Quintana, at the FTI Winter Equestrian Festival in Palm Beach on Sunday.

New title: Ms Bloomberg, 31, gave birth to Jasper on Christmas Eve in New York City

Looking out for the little guy: Ms Bloomberg said that she has been 'lucky enough' to afford to hire help

Big name: The baby's full name is Jasper Michael Brown Quintana, with his two middle names as clear homages to her parents- Michael Bloomberg and Susan Brown

The couple had massive grins across their faces throughout the visit as Georgina held the baby in her arms while watching the horse jumping.

They were joined by an unidentified woman at one point during the event, but the new mom was completely focused on her little baby.

Jasper's early introduction to the world of horse racing comes as little surprise as both his parents are professional equestrians.

'Ramiro and I have known each other since I was 15; we met doing the same horse shows. Then in October of last year, we were both single and decided we were mature enough for a real relationship,' she told Glamour.

Similar interests: Quintana and Bloomberg are both professional equestrians and met when she was 15

Support: The new parents were joined by an unidentified woman during their Sunday visit to the horse arena

Doting: Ms Bloomberg and her friend tried to stop the baby's cries, tying his white cap on more securely to see if that helped the little tot

'When we realized we wanted to become parents, I stopped taking birth control. (I was in Las Vegas when I realized I was pregnant—good thing I found out on the early side of the trip!)'

The horse-loving pair are going to waste no time in getting their son out in the arena, and in August she revealed that she had 'one little rescued mini' named Harley she plan on giving to their son.

'We're gonna try popping a little saddle on him, and get him ready,' she told The New York Post at the time.

'We have a couple of years to get him all trained up.

Solution: Jasper calmed down instantly once he got his bottle

Natural: Ms Bloomberg said that she and her boyfriend intend to co-parent the child and are very much together but she never had any desire to marry after her parent's marriage ended in divorce during her childhood

Milestone: Jasper is the first grandchild for Mike Bloomberg, Georgina's billionaire father

Happy surprise: Georgina previously revealed that while she and Ramiro started their relationship in October before realizing that she was pregnant during a trip to Las Vegas in the spring

Tropical climes: Jasper was born in New York City but the family has been in Florida for much of his life

'I kind of always said when I first 
rescued this little mini that I wanted him to be my first child's pony. 
It's perfect timing.'

Though
 Quintana and Bloomberg are very much together and will be raising the 
child together, marriage is not on the horizon for the pair.

Because of her parent's divorce, Georgina explained that she has never planned on getting married, telling Glamour magazine that she doesn't 'need a marriage license and a party'.

That
 sentiment doesn't run through her entire family, however, as her older 
sister Emma, 34, has been married since 2005 though she and her husband 
Chris Frissora do not have any children.

Back on the party circuit: Georgina got right back into gown 12 days after giving birth, as she attended the Grand Prix Invitational hosted by Donald Trump on January 5, pictured with Melania and Ivanka Trump

Ms Bloomberg said that she has hired help, but enjoys spending as much time with the little tot as possible.

'I am lucky enough to be in a position to be able to afford help, but I really want to be involved and experience the responsibility and, of course, the bonding,' Georgina told The New York Post.

'Having a baby is something I’ve always wanted and I’m obviously going to do as much for him myself as I possibly can.'

It hasn't stopped her from getting back on the social circuit, however, as she was seen earlier this month at an event at Donald Trump's Palm Beach golf course.

Barely showing: The heiress attended a Humane Society benefit in mid November (seen here with her father), just shy of six weeks before her due date

Men in her life: Georgina is the younger daughter of Mike Bloomberg, who has temporarily left public life after finishing his third term as New York City's mayor, and Ramiro was her date to the Humane Society benefit
