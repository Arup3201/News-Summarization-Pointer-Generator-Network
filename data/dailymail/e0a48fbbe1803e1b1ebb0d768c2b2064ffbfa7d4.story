Hannah, Lena Dunham's character on Girls, is not known for having a designer wardrobe; in fact, her constant mooching off friends and flitting from job to job would suggest exactly the opposite.

Yet in recent photos taken during filming of the HBO show's upcoming third season, the actress is seen wearing a McQ by Alexander McQueen dress, which retails at full price for $1,165.

While Hannah does get more into character by accessorizing the graphic look with a pair of well-worn sneakers, the graphic print frock is a far cry from the frumpy looks she donned in earlier seasons.

Out of character? Lena Dunham was spotted in a chic McQ by Alexander McQueen frock while shooting the upcoming season of Girls - a far cry from her character Hannah's usual frumpy looks

Pricey: The dress retails for $1,165, which Hannah surely couldn't afford with her frugal lifestyle. But stylist Jenn Rogien said that a 'chic dress' is part of that episode's story - and that she found it on the sale rack

Hannah-friendly discount: On shopbop.com, the peplum frock is on sale for $932

The show's stylist, Jenn Rogien told MailOnline that Hannah's chic dress is 'part of the story' for that particular episode that was being filmed.

'That dress was a perfect choice,' she said, adding this is 'probably the only designer piece we've used on Hannah.'

The stylist explained that 'thankfully - for the story and for my budget,' she found it on the sale rack.

But the designer frock is still markedly more fashion-forward than the somewhat dowdy duds Hannah typically wears.

Indeed, in January Ms Rogien told the Huffington Post that she makes her character appear disheveled on purpose.

'They don't quite hit at the right place,' she said of the clothes Hannah wears. 'We mess with the hem lengths so they're not exactly the best or most flattering length.

'We don't press her clothes, so that they aren't completely put together,' she explained, adding: 'We're using the costume to help support her emotional journey.

'Sometimes that means having things 
dwarf her a little bit, or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because 
that's helping to drive the emotion, support the story and reflect 
what's going on.'

'Hannah's look is evolving to support her story this season'

Indeed, in the fifth episode of season two, Hannah wore a too-short grey and orange playsuit when she had her dalliance with Joshua, the doctor.

While at first it seemed their fling was good for Hannah, giving her a confidence boost, it all came crashing down at the end of the episode when she cried into his lap, and he consequently lost all interest.

And who could forget the bright yellow mesh tank top she sported during her cocaine-fulled night out with Elijah?

You are what you wear: In previous seasons, Hannah's clothes were often awkward fitting - which, according to Girls stylist Jenn Rogien, was actually done on purpose to reflect her 'emotional journey'

Disheveled: Ms Rogien explained: 'Sometimes [we make] things dwarf her a little bit, or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because that's helping to drive the emotion, support the story and reflect what's going on'

While
she and her roommate seemed to enjoy themselves, the episode came to a 
head when Hannah confronted Marnie about being a 'bad friend'.

But
it seems Hannah's 'emotional journey' may have a happy destination 
after all.

'She might be almost getting it kind of together,' Ms Rogien told MailOnline. 'But she is still our Hannah and still doesn't have a ton of money.'

Many of her outfits of late have been markedly more 
put-together than usual - though not all are as pricey as the McQ dress.

On Tuesday, Lena was spotted on set in a stylish navy number from Anthropologie.The $148 dress was adorned with a bright orange cherry pattern, which she topped off with a pair of brown woven flats.

That same day, the 27-year-old stepped out in a demure skirt-and-top ensemble with a crisp white collar.

Are things looking up for Hannah? 'Hannah's look is evolving just a bit to support her story this season,' said Ms Rogien. 'We're tweaking each of the girls' looks to keep up with their adventures'

She
wore the same well-worn canvas sneakers with this outfit, which included 
embellished sleeves and a see-through black panel at the hem of the 
skirt.

Ms Rogien has said in the past that Hannah is vintage-driven, which is reflected in her wardrobe, but that she also is the type to save up for pricier items from shops like Madewell and Anthropologie.

Whether Hannah simply saved up for her McQ dress, or whether the plot explains her new-found penchant for designer, remains unclear.

'I don't want to give anything away,' said Ms Rogien, adding: 'It was the right dress for the right moment.
