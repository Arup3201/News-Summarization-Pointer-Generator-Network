Someone in Colorado is holding the winning Powerball ticket for a $90 million prize.

The Colorado Lottery says it's the largest Powerball jackpot ever won in the state.

It says the winning ticket for Saturday night's multistate drawing was purchased at a Kum & Go convenience store in the small western city of Rifle.

The ticketholder has yet to come forward.

Feeling lucky?  The winning $90million Powerball ticket was sold at one of three Kum & Go venues in the town of Rifle, Colorado

The winner matched the five winning numbers - 3, 12, 31, 34, 51 - and the Powerball, 24.

The Colorado Lottery says the $90 million jackpot amounts to an estimated $54.9 million cash payout.

The store will get a $50,000 commission.

Another Colorado ticket also won $1 million in the drawing.

It was purchased in the Denver suburb of Broomfield, and the winner hasn't come forward yet.

In the money: What makes you play?

So what drives people to play the lottery, and what makes them think their $1 investment— among the many, many millions — will bring staggering wealth?

'It's the same question as to why do people gamble,' said Stephen Goldbart, author of 'Affluence Intelligence' and co-director of the Money, Meaning & Choices Institute in California.

'It's a desire to improve your life in a way that's driven by fantasy... The bigger the fantasy, the tastier it gets.'

In a piece called 'Lottery-itis!,' Goldbart and co-author Joan DiFuria wrote on their blog last year on the Psychology Today website that in times of economic stress, playing the lottery is a way of coping with financial anxieties and uncertainty.

'We may seek a magic pill to make us feel better,' they wrote. 'Ah yes, buy a lottery ticket. Feel again like you did when you were a child, having hope that a better day will come, that some big thing will happen that will make everything right, set the course on track.'  

Between 65 and 70 percent of roughly 259 million possible number combinations will be in play when the numbers are drawn, Otto says. For the ticket-buying optimists, that's no deterrent.

'Even though the odds are against you, it's just the excitement of, 'Hey, I might wake up one day and be a millionaire,' says Chris Scales, a 31-year-old hot dog vendor in downtown Nashville, Tenn., who brings in about $35,000 a year 'if I really hustle.'

He usually reserves his lottery playing for jackpots of at least $40 million.

The incredibly remote odds don't really sink in for people, says George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who has researched the motives underlying lottery ticket purchases.

'People don't really understand probabilities at all,' he says. 'Once you have a bunch of zeroes, it doesn't matter how many you have — one in 10,000, one in a million or one in a billion. ... People do understand the meaning of the word 'largest.' They overact to one dimension and underreact to the other.'

They also cling to a more romantic notion: Amazing things happen to others, so why not for me?

'When people are desperately sick, there's always a part of the brain that thinks there will be a miracle cure,' Loewenstein says.

'If you want something to be true, your brain is awfully good at figuring out reasons, magical ones, that there's a good likelihood that it is true. The desire to win does drive a certain kind of frenzied optimism.'

That frenzy can grow during the holiday season, when financial hardships become more glaring and people feel pressure to spend money they don't have to demonstrate their love.

'If you have plenty of money in the bank, you're not likely to feel the need to buy a lottery ticket,' Goldbart explains.

'But if there's something missing financially and emotionally and you're thinking, 'I can't get a raise or I'm not likely to get another job,' you buy a ticket as a psychological compensation plan.'
