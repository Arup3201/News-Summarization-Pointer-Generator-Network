Twitter bosses have announced that their social networking site will block posts in Pakistan deemed to contain 'blasphemous' or 'unethical' material.

Abdul Batin, from Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority, sent five requests to Twitter per day after messages appeared containing pictures of the Prophet Muhammad and links to anti-Islam blogs.

It is the first time the social network has agreed to block content in Pakistan, though it has previously agreed to block content in other countries, including neo-Nazi tweets in Germany.

Twitter has agreed to ban certain posts in Pakistan after a complaint from the country's internet watchdog

According to a report in the New York Times, among the blocked messages will be crude drawings of the Prophet Muhammad, photographs of burning Korans, messages from a handful of anti-Islam bloggers and an American porn star.

However, some have argued that the move is unnecessary as the Pakistan IT regulator already has a page allowing users to report blasphemous content.

The company has a country-specific filtering policy, meaning the tweets each user sees can be modified on a country-by-country basis.

Among the outlawed tweets are pictures of the Prophet Mohammad, images of burning Korans, messages from an America porn star and links to anti-Islam blogs

Earlier this week the site blocked tweets from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group to stop them being seen in Russia.

Critics accused the company, which has previously trumpeted its commitments to free speech, as further adding to censorship in a country where it is already rife.

However, Twitter has argued that blocking specific posts is preferable to having the whole site taken down.
