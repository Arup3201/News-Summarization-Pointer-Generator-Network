A hooded cyclist is one of possibly three offenders

A hooded cyclist is believed to be one of up to three men preying on women as they travel to and from work or go for a jog.

The women were all indecently assaulted between the hours of 6am and 8am and 6pm and 8pm in the Melbourne suburbs of Altona North and Newport.

Every victim - except the most recent - was grabbed from behind and several victims were wearing headphones. Two women saw a man ride off on a mountain bike.

Police believe as many as three men could be involved in the 13 attacks which have occurred in the past four months.

'We're not convinced it's the same individual because some of the offending is different,' Detective Inspector Martin Allison said on Wednesday.

'With the exception of the most recent incident, all victims were grabbed from behind.

'He doesn't speak, there's no exchange and consequently ... most of the offending is done from the rear.

'We're not at liberty to disclose the method of his offending but we have some concerns that his offending is escalating.'

The most recent attack was on Seventh Street in Altona North on Sunday night.

The offender was described as Caucasian and wearing a dark-coloured hooded top pulled over his face, and dark trousers.

Police are urging victims to contact them immediately as late reporting had led to 'the trail going cold'.

Police stepped up patrols of the area and said they would set up an information caravan on Mason Street each evening this week.
