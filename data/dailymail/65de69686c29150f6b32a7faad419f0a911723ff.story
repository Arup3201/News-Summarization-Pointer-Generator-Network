Dr Craig Spencer is in a serious but stable condition as he continues to fight the potentially deadly Ebola virus in a New York hospital. 

Medics treating Mr Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola five days ago after returning from fighting the outbreak in Guinea, say they are doing all they can to bring him back to health.

New York health and hospitals corporation president Dr. Ram Raju said: 'This morning I talked to our patient and his doctors and nurses at Bellevue Hospital Center.

'The patient looks better than he looked yesterday, but he remains in serious but stable condition with the expected symptoms of the virus. 

'He tolerated the plasma treatment well and had a good night sleep.

'From his first day here, he expressed gratitude with the care he is receiving under the watchful eye of the dedicated, well trained and professional team of ICU physicians and nurses who are exclusively assigned to his care.

'On behalf of our patient, I thank all New Yorkers for their prayers and well wishes. 

'The entire HHC family and our expert team at Bellevue are committed to doing all we can to bring this brave, caring doctor back to good health.' 

On Friday night, the 33-year-old  received a blood donation from aid worker Nancy Writebol, who survived the virus, after tests found they shared the same blood type.

It is a move that medics believe could save his life after Ebola survivors Nina Pham, Amber Jay Vinson, Ashoka Mukpo and Dr Nick Sacra were all cured following blood transfusions. 

Writebol contracted Ebola while working with Christian aid group SIM in Liberia with her husband, who is also a missionary.

They were working with their close friend Dr Kent Brantley, who also contracted the disease and was later cured.

Meanwhile, Dr Spencer, is receiving antiviral medication and plasma, after he was admitted to hospital with a 100.3-degree fever on Thursday. 

The medic arrived in New York on October 17 - six days before he was admitted to hospital.

During that time he went bowling in Brooklyn, rode the subway and took a taxi, walked Manhattan's High Line and went to restaurants.

He reportedly started feeling ill on Tuesday, but the fever did not develop until Thursday. He promptly called officials at the non-government organisation he worked with, Doctors Without Borders, who then called New York's health department.

Emergency health workers rushed to Dr Spencer's apartment on West 147th Street, in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, in full protective gear. 

He was taken to Bellevue about 1pm and his apartment was sealed off, with biohazard cleaners brought in, it is reported. 

The revelation that Dr Spencer was allowed to move freely around New York city for days before being taken to hospital prompted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to implement mandatory quarantines for anyone returning from treating Ebola patients.

Kaci Hickox, 33, a Doctors Without Borders nurse, was the first to be put in isolation in a tent in the University Hospital parking lot in Newark.

She was forced into isolation on Friday last week after showing a temperature of 101F, though later tested negative for Ebola.

She blasted her treatment as 'inhumane' and threatened to sue for release, prompting Cuomo and Christie to soften their policies to allow for home quarantine amid criticism from the White House.

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, who is facing a re-election battle next week, has instituted a similar policy despite there being no confirmed cases of Ebola in the state.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines yesterday saying those who had come into contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola patients should stay away from commercial transportation or public gatherings.

The agency said those who had simply traveled to help fight the disease should only be subject to symptom monitoring, in an attempt to create a unified national response to the disease.

However, a U.S. Army commander in Italy said he and his troops returning from Liberia would remain in isolation for 21 days, even though he feels they face no risk and show no symptoms. 

The Army's chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, directed the 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from the Ebola fight in West Africa, an Army spokeswoman said.

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids.
