David Cameron is 'watching what he eats', Downing Street confirmed today in the latest evidence of the slimming craze sweeping the Cabinet.

With George Osborne on the 5:2 diet, Michael Gove attending an Austrian ‘fat farm’ and Eric Pickles 'no chips, no cheese' strictures, it seems half the government is tightening its belt.

But the suggestion that the Prime Minister is keeping an eye on his weight appeared to be undermined today, when he was pictured buying cakes at a sale in Number 10.

Four years in power has taken its toll on the waistlines of many members of the Cabinet.

A combination of stress, eating on the go and endless receptions with tempting - but high calorie - canapes means it is all too easy to pile on the pounds.

Mr Cameron, who has fought an on-off battle with his weight, tucked
 into low-fat options on his flight back from a trip to Tel Aviv last 
week, after Number 10 asked for him to be served a selection containing 
no dairy products.

Aides insisted he was not following a specific dairy-free diet, but today his official spokesman confirmed the Prime Minister was trying to curb his carbs.

Mr Cameron is said to be 
experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, 
which is low in calories and fat.

At a regular briefing for journalists, the spokesman was asked if the PM puts almond milk on his porridge.

He replied: ‘I am tempted to say that I don’t really tuck into these kinds of stories,’ before admitting ‘there is one morsel I could offer’.

He added: ‘Does the PM keep an eye on what he eats, I’m sure that’s the case but I don’t think it’s anything too strict.’

When pressed he complained that journalists were ‘making a meal of it’. Pressed again, he conceded: ‘I’ve run out of really bad puns.’

David Cameron, who has filled out since taking office in 2010, is said to be trying out dairy alternatives

Last week on a visit to Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, Mr Cameron opted for a small ham salad and fruit juice

However, Mr Cameron was later seen casting his eye over a selection of cakes on sale for charity in Downing Street.

Fundraisers, including TV presenter Davina McCall, were invited to Number 10 to mark Sport Relief.

Schoolchildren baked cakes to sell to raise money for the charity, with the PM appeared unable to resist.

Questions about the Prime Minister's dieting emerged after photograph's showed Mr Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday.

The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week.

It follows his decision to start wearing a hi-tech Jawbone wristband to keep track of his fitness regime and sleep patterns.

Mr Cameron’s efforts to keep in trim have been hampered by a knee injury, which has curtailed his jogging.

Although he has been able to take up the activity again recently, it is still only at a relatively low level.

Aides
 said he had been ‘pounding the streets’ in Jerusalem last week, but 
sources later revealed his activity had been confined to a short 
10-minute jog.

The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread.

In
 an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New 
Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I 
think. That’s the key one for me.’

But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall.

At
 the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the 
unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at 
least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’.

In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’.

He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised.

‘The
 thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just
 see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and 
they just think it’s another one,’ he said.

Flight
 records from last week confirm that a special diet was requested for Mr
 Cameron on his trip to Israel and Palestine. He was listed as the 
flight’s ‘VVIP’, with a note to say he should be served ‘non-dairy’ 
meals.

His main meal on the five-hour flight from Tel Aviv to London was salmon served with salad. He was also served with a snack of tacos with chicken and vegetables.

Asked about the meal selection, a Downing Street spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ to make.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, meanwhile, has taken up kickboxing in a bid to get fit and slim down for the general election, and it emerged that the Education Secretary Michael Gove spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ popular with celebrities. The £2,500 stay is said to have helped him shed two stone.
