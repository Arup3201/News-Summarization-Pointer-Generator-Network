A prostitute who murdered a wealthy property developer before pilfering his bank account was jailed for life today.

Emma Bate, 26, and her boyfriend Paramjit Singh, 33, battered and stabbed businessman Richard Sherratt to death in his own home after torturing him for his PIN.

Just hours after his death, Bate was caught on CCTV smooching and celebrating with Singh after withdrawing cash from the bank account of her 'sugar-daddy'.

Sherratt, who was said to be 
'infatuated' with Bate and showered her gifts as well as giving her 
£8,000, was found semi-naked on his blood-stained bed by his former 
partner on June 15 last year.

He had suffered a total of 38 injuries
including five blows to the head, a stab wound to his arm and puncture 
marks on his face and neck. He died from blood blocking his airways.

The pair fled the the house in 
picturesque Bridgnorth, Shropshire, after stealing Mr Sherratt’s bank 
cards, cash and a watch worth £10,000.

Pictures released by police after the 
case show the moment the couple snogged outside a bank in Handsworth, 
Birmingham, the following day and Bate waving her arm around in a 
'celebratory manner.'

Horrific death: Richard Sherratt suffered a total of 38 injuries including five blows to the head, a stab wound to his arm and puncture marks on his face and neck

The pair were jailed for life at Stafford Crown Court today after Bate was found guilty of murder at a trial in January.

The vice girl, from Birmingham, had 
denied murder, but admitted robbing.

She told the court during the 
trial: 'I feel really bad because he treated me like a princess.'

Singh, also from Birmingham, had already admitted murdering, robbing and defrauding Mr Sherratt.

Bate will serve a minimum sentence of 25 years for his murder, while Singh was ordered to serve at least 18 years.

They were both given 10 years each to run concurrently for robbery.

After the case, Detective Inspector 
Steve Tonks, from West Mercia Police, said: 'The motive for this crime 
was clearly greed and the defendants Singh and Bate resorted to violence
in seeking access to their victim’s money.

'It was a premeditated crime whereby 
they planned to rob Mr Sherratt and to commit fraud by withdrawing funds
from his bank accounts.

'They planned to travel late at night when they knew Mr Sherratt would be at home and would be asleep.

'The court heard distressing details 
about the degree of violence used while Mr Sherratt was held captive and
tortured in his own home last June.

'He was subjected to a callous and brutal ordeal with the injuries sustained, sadly resulting in his death.

'Today’s verdicts send out a strong 
message that anyone resorting to violence for criminal purposes, will be
brought to justice.

'The circumstances of this case with its tragic outcome have been harrowing.'

Sent down: Bate will serve a minimum sentence of 25 years, while Singh was ordered to serve at least 18

During Bate’s trial, the jury heard 
twice-divorced Mr Sherratt had met the hooker and treated her to 
expensive jewellery, nights in luxury hotels and thousands in cash gifts
in March last year.

Mr Sherratt, who was the brother of 
Francine Austin, ex-wife of David Austin who runs world renowned David 
Austin Roses, was said to be 'craving companionship'.

He took her to four-star hotels, plush
restaurants, put £8,000 in her bank account and even planned to take 
her on holiday to Dubai.

But they split up in May after she 
began bombarding him with text messages begging for cash to fund her 
addiction to crack cocaine.

The court heard Bate and Singh 
targeted Mr Sherratt because she knew he was well off and she needed 
cash to fund her addiction to class A drugs.
