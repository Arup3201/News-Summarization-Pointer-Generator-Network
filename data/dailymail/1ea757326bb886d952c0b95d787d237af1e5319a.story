Global climate talks have been rescued from the brink of collapse – but leave a gaping loophole which could allow countries to continue polluting the atmosphere.

Negotiations overran by 31 hours as politicians from 192 countries struggled to reach agreement on the ground rules for a new climate treaty.

A fortnight-long United Nations summit in Peru had aimed to lay the framework for new international laws to slow the pace of global warming.

But the discussions became bad tempered as countries bickered over who should bear responsibility for reducing carbon emissions, whether richer nations should reduce pollution more quickly and how much aid they should pay to help poor countries adapt to global warming.

Eventually, they agreed to a watered-down deal which postpones the most difficult decisions for 12 months.

The final treaty, which is due to be signed in Paris in 12 months, will be the first international climate agreement since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

Energy secretary Ed Davey, who led the 45-strong British delegation in Lima, hailed the compromise agreement as a fundamental step to ensure all nations reduce their climate emissions.

Speaking in the early hours of Sunday morning Lima, he said: ‘We have been up all night, we have sweated to get this deal.

‘We have unlocked the door to the big climate change deal we need in Paris next year.’

But he admitted that even if the draft is strengthened over the next 12 months, it may not actually be enforceable.

Britain’s own Climate Change Act forces us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 80 per cent by 2050 – driving a boom in wind farms and solar panels as a result.

Negotiators hope to force other nations to adopt similar targets in a legally-binding treaty.

Mr Davey had repeatedly insisted that all countries should provide clear, detailed pledges of the action they will take well in advance of next December’s summit.

But in the final negotiation the language of the agreement was softened. Whereas before it had insisted that countries ‘shall provide’ details about their emissions, in the final version it said they ‘may include’ the information ‘as appropriate’ to their circumstances.

Critics said this is a major loophole which may allow nations such as Australia – which is critical of the UN process – to wriggle out of the deal.

Mr Davey, however, insisted it was a clear victory to include any request for nations to provide quantifiable information about their emission reduction plans.

‘There are no penalties and sanctions with this stuff, it is about political pressure,’ he said.

‘Any deal we get in Paris next year will not be enforced by fines and sanctions, it will be enforced by political pressure.’

But Alden Meyer, director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists lobby group, said the language left room for nations to wriggle out of the deal.

‘It means it is totally up to everyone now whether they provide that information or not,’ he said.

Lord Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, welcomed progress made at the summit – but he said the Paris treaty will fail to stop drastic global warming because it has come too late.

He said: ‘It is already clear that the scale of action to control and reduce annual emissions of greenhouse gases will collectively not be consistent with a pathway that will mean a reasonable chance of avoiding dangerous global warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial level.’

Previous hopes for a climate deal peaked in 2009 at Copenhagen, before the talks fell apart in fierce bickering. Negotiators have been trying to build bridges ever since.

Jonathan Grant, director of climate change at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The climate talks almost ground to a halt here in Lima. Progress outside the process failed to translate to progress inside the negotiating hall.

The Lima summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by Greenpeace, in which damage was done to the ancient Nazca Lines in southern Peru

‘Brinkmanship is normal in these negotiations, but there's concern that the talks will fall off the cliff in Paris, like they did in Copenhagen.’

The Lima summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by Greenpeace, in which damage was done to the ancient Nazca Lines in southern Peru.

Peruvian ministers said the activists had permanently damaged the 1,500-year-old carvings while laying a banner calling for action at the summit.

The conference, attended by 12,500 delegates, green activists and journalists, suffered another setback when it emerged it had produced more carbon emissions than any other summit in the 20-year history of the negotiations.

More than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted – more than the entire populations of Sierra Leone or Barbados over the same period – partially because plans to run the conference on green energy fell through and organisers had to rely on dirty diesel generators.

Liberal Democrat minister Ed Davey has accused the Tories of abandoning their green convictions in fear of Ukip

Liberal Democrat minister Ed Davey has accused the Tories of abandoning their green convictions in fear of Ukip.

Five years after they promised to ‘Vote Blue, Go Green,’ the Conservatives have changed their stance as they pander to climate-sceptic Ukip, Mr Davey said.

In a stinging attacked on his Coalition allies, the Energy Secretary said Tory MPs are shedding their ideals to win back votes from the right-wing party.

Mr Davey is furious that Amber Rudd, the minister for climate change, was stopped by Conservative whips last week from accompanying him to a UN climate summit in Peru.

As part of the trip, Miss Rudd was scheduled to visit a glacier in the Andes to highlight the dangers of global warming - a media stunt that would have had echoes of David Cameron’s much-ridiculed ‘hugging a husky’ visit to the Arctic in 2006.

Speaking in Lima as the climate summit drew to a close yesterday, Mr Davey said many Tories had abandoned environmental convictions they vaunted at the last election.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said: ‘There are some Conservatives who see this issue as a way of chasing Ukip votes.

‘That is deeply regrettable because you need to be consistent and you need to hold to your principles.

‘Just because some extreme party comes on the scene, doesn’t mean you suddenly change your policies.’

David Cameron famously coaxed his party into a position of ‘green conservatism’ soon after he took leadership of the party in 2005.

He travelled on husky sleds across a remote Norwegian glacier to see first-hand the effects of global warming, proclaiming that he wanted to lead a ‘new green revolution and recapture climate change from the pessimists’.

But his party has shifted substantially on green issues since then, promising a cap on new on-shore wind farms, slashing subsidies for solar panels and weakening protection of the green belt.

Last year Mr Cameron was infamously reported as ordering officials to cut environmental levies and ‘get rid of the green c**p’.

Critics point to the influence of Lynton Crosby, Mr Cameron’s strategist, who has shifted the party’s emphasis in a bid to deal with the electoral threat from Ukip.

A Liberal Democrat source said: ‘The Tory green wash continues to fade.

‘From trying to halt onshore wind to slapping a banning order on attendance at crucial climate change talks, the Tory high command is in reverse gear when it comes to the green agenda.’

Mr Davey accused the Conservatives of consciously distancing themselves from green issues they held dear at the 2010 election in response to a threat from the right.

‘I’m not suggesting the Prime Minister is, but I think there are clearly some Tories who think that moving away from their position on green issues is now a vote winner,’ he said.

Mr Davey also demanded that chief whip Michael Gove explain why he barred Miss Rudd’s trip to Lima.

‘I know Amber was disappointed and Mr Gove will no doubt want to explain to his colleagues why he thought it was important for her to remain in Westminster,’ he told a press conference in Lima.

‘She is an excellent climate change minister. She was due to go and see the problems caused by climate change to a glacier here in Peru.

‘Her trip would have helped illustrate why we are all here and why we are taking climate change so seriously.’
