A former Alabama high school teacher and cheerleading coach accused of having an affair with a teenage boy was sentenced Thursday to five years in prison.

In May, Jennifer McNeill, 39, pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree rape and one count of second-degree sodomy.

McNeill said in court that she was sorry for what she had done, adding, ’I've lost so much... I've learned my lesson.’

Justice served: Jennifer McNeill, 39, a former teacher from Alabama, has been handed a five-year sentence for carrying on a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy

Authorities say the victim, a 14-year-old boy, was not a student at the school where McNeill worked.

Prosecutors had dismissed some charges in exchange for McNeill's guilty plea.

Judge John Bush, who handed down the sentence this morning, called the defendant's actions 'absolutely abhorrent,' adding that as a figure of authority she had betrayed the trust of the community, Al.com reported.

The victim’s mother also spoke in court, saying that not a day goes by that her son does not pay for what happened between him and McNeill - a long-time family friend and a Sunday school teacher. 

The woman added that the teenager has been undergoing counseling to deal with the aftermath of the abuse he had endured at McNeill’s hands, according to the station WSFA.

McNeill's sentencing was pushed back last month after a post was discovered on her Facebook account suggesting that she was innocent.

Two weeks ago, McNeill’s attorney told the judge that her client denied writing the message and claimed that the victim and his relatives had access to her page.

During sentencing Thursday, McNeill's lawyer apologized to the boy and his family, telling the court that her client had admitted to misrepresenting facts about the Facebook status update, which she penned.

Scene: McNeill worked at Thorsby High School where she primarily taught 
six graders and was also a sponsor for the cheerleading team.

McNeill, a married sixth-grade teacher from Thorsby, was arrested last year and originally charged with six counts of rape and two counts of sodomy of a juvenile male - some of the alleged encounters took place on school grounds.

McNeill's illicit romance with her friend's son lasted from April 2012 to June 2013, during which time the lovers had sexual intercourse at least six times and on two occasions engaged in oral sex.

The 14-year-old claimed that one of their trysts took place in McNeill's classroom during the summer break, but the teacher has denied that.

Sheriff Kevin Davis said in February that his office 
began investigating allegations that McNeill was having sex with a minor after they got a call from the Department of Human Resources.
