When pictures emerged of Helen Mirren on holiday in Italy sporting a red bikini, the reaction was sensational.

At 63, she had a healthy toned figure many 30 year-old women could only dream of.

And it would seem the impact is still going strong six years later, as JD Williams has seen a massive surge in the swimming style in their over-50s customers.

Influential: Dame Helen Mirren was 63 when this photo was taken in Pelugia, Italy in 2008. It's impact is still going strong: JD Williams have reported an 230 per cent surge in bikini sales from their over 50s customers

The women’s retailers has announced a
 growth of +227 per cent year on year in bikini sets, driven by their 
costumer base who, ironically, were born around the time of the 
two-piece’s invention in 1946.

Separates are selling especially 
well, in particular the high-waist brief. So strong is the trend that 
swimwear buyers have dubbed the skimpy beachwear the ‘Grankini’.

And it’s not just Mirren who can rock a two-piece over the age of 50.

Celebrities such as Demi Moore, Kathy 
Griffin, Sharon Stone, Jerry Hall, Sheryl Crow and Denise Welch have all
 given their younger counterparts a run for their money over recent years , looking fabulous in bikinis.

Rachael Antal, Swimwear Buyer at JD Williams says: ‘Historically, when British women hit fifty there is a noticeable shift in their body confidence which generally means sales of one-pieces soar and bikini sales deplete.

‘Now, celebrities around the world are embracing their shape and looking fabulous in the two-piece.

'Wearing
 a supportive, well-proportioned bikini is less aging and accentuates 
rather than hides natural shape.

'Advances in swimwear design mean 
that we can now create bikinis that flatter a mature shape.

'Wider straps, wires and built-in 
mesh support hoist and shape breasts in the same way that lingerie does,
 while bikini bottoms with higher waist lines offer coverage for any 
wobbly bits or stretch marks.'

Women
 over 50 are responsible for £6.7 billion of British fashion spend and 
much of this is apportioned to the summer wardrobe, according to JD Williams research.

Psychologist Rachel
 MacLynn comments: 'By 2050 the 
over 50s will account for two billion of the population.

'The term ‘flat age society’ has been applied to this constantly expanding market who manage the ageing process in a way our predecessors did not.

'There are no rules to say when a woman should retire her bikini. Women over fifty are as interested in looking glamorous as their younger counterparts; and the beach is no exception.

'Traditional age barriers no longer exist - meaning that customers of all ages are confident about fashion.'
