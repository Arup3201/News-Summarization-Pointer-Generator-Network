The Winter Olympics may be over for another year but that hasn’t stopped an Australian building a street version of the superfast sled - powered by jets.

Daz Fellows’ luge is fitted with two thrusters that produce 200lbs (91kg) of thrust each.

Fellows claims his design has the potential to reach 311mph (500km/h) and he plans to take on the current world record of 115.83 mph (186km/h) next year.

Australian Daz Fellows, pictured, began working on his street luge last year. It has already undergone various road and wind tunnel tests. This test was carried out in New South Wales earlier this week. The luge, pictured, is 9.84ft (3 metres) long and is fitted with two jet thrusters

The record for the world’s fastest street luge was set by Jason Bradbury on the set of The Gadget Show’s 200th episode in Bentwaters Parks, Suffolk, in 2011.

Fellows goes by the stage name Daz the Cowboy and is a TV stuntman from New South Wales.

He claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge dubbed Jet Luge. It is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell.

At 9.84ft (3 metres) long, the luge has also been referred to as a ‘man-sized’ skateboard controlled using a thumb accelerator, and lean steer turning.

Fellows claims his jet-powered street luge, also called Jet Luge, pictured, is capable of reaching speeds of up to 311mph (500 km/h). It has additionally been dubbed a 'man-sized skateboard'

The thumb-controlled wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed.

This wheel can be set at a pre-determined speed, or used as a dynamic accelerator.

Alternatively,
 the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip control where the rider can 
use their pointer finger to control acceleration.

At full power, the turbines, pictured, produce 200lbs (91kg) of thrust each, and afterburners on the tail add an extra 35 per cent to 43 per cent thrust. Fellows hopes to beat the current world record of 115.83 mph (186km/h)

The entire powered system is routed to a kill switch cable attached to the rider, and in the event of an emergency the cable is pulled free and everything shuts down.

A secondary unit is positioned behind, and in the event the rider cannot see, a second person can hit that button and shut the entire system down.

Fellows became involved in, and was one of the original founders of, street luge in Australia 1996.

The luge, pictured left, features lean steer turning. A wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed. Alternatively, the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration. It was designed and assembled by Fellows over 18 months

Following further wind tunnel tests, pictured, Fellows will attempt to break the world record between April and August 2015. By doing it during the Australian winter, Fellows claims it will help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output

His luge was designed and assembled with his team and involved hundreds of hours of design and testing.

They have spent the last 18 months building the board from scratch.

His record attempt will be carried out between April and August 2015. Fellows claims this is to help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output.

Dimensions

Length:  9.84ft (3 metres) from nose to tail

Height: 1.4ft (0.42 metres)

Width: 1.9ft (0.59 metres) with turbines

Total weight: 72lbs (33kg)

The engines

Maximum thrust (5 minute rating): 202lbs (91kg)

Maximum continuous thrust: 176lbs (80kg)

Engine weight: 29lbs (13kg)

Fuel tank: approximately 22 litres

Control

Lean steer turning.

A thumb-controlled wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to increase or decrease speed.

The wheel can be set at a speed, or used as a dynamic accelerator.

Alternatively, the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip control where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration.

Power

The entire powered system is routed to a kill switch cable attached to the rider, and in the event of an emergency the cable is pulled free and everything shuts down.

A secondary unit is positioned behind the rider, and in the event that the rider can't see, a second person can hit that button and shut the entire system down.
