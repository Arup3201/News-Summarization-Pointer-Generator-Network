A four-year-old dog had her throat ripped apart and was left for dead after being mauled during a dog fight.

Staffie Lexi was found collapsed in a back yard with horrific injuries to her throat and neck and blood pouring from her wounds.

It is thought she was dumped in Nelson, Lancashire, after being used for bait in a dog fight.

Four-year-old Staffie Lexi suffered horrific throat injuries after being mauled in a dog fight and was left needing several stitches in her neck, pictured. Her rescuers fear she may have been used as bait for other dogs

Lexi has had several operations since the attack and is now on the road to recovery after vets stitched up her throat. She has a temporary tube in her neck to stop unwanted fluid and blood building up in her throat

She was taken to the vets by a passer-by before being taken in by rescue centre, Pendle Dogs in Need.

On the charity’s Facebook page, workers described Lexi as having ‘obvious signs of being used as a bait dog’ after she was found on March 12.

A post, accompanied by a picture of Lexi, read: ‘This little dog has horrific injuries. She collapsed in the vets due to the amount of blood loss from her injuries.

‘Please be aware that this barbaric sort of thing does happen and it’s happening on our doorstep.

‘Please keep your dogs close by and safe, this could happen to anyone's beloved pet.

‘Apart from her injuries this girl does look and act like she's been well loved.’

Rescuers who found Lexi after she was dumped in a back yard in Lancashire on March 12 described her as having 'obvious signs of being used as a bait dog'. She is now temporarily being cared for by rescuers

Lexi’s collar’s micro-chip suggests she was originally from the Bolton area, but the chip’s details are out of date so her owner cannot be located.

Workers at Pendle Dogs in Need, Lancashire, are desperate to locate Lexi’s owners. 

They said: ‘She's a very sweet natured calm little girl who has quite obviously been well loved and looked after prior to this happening to her.

‘She knows her basic commands and is well mannered and happily gives a paw for a treat.

‘Was Lexi stolen/sold or just given away as many of this wonderful breed are? Where are the people who have so obviously cared for and loved this little girl?

'Are they looking for her? Please share to help us find out.’

Four-year-old Lexi also suffered injuries to her legs in the attack, pictured, and was found bleeding from several wounds after she was dumped in a back yard and left for dead

Workers at Pendle Dogs in Need, Lancashire, who are hoping to find her owner, said: 'She's a very sweet natured calm little girl who has quite obviously been well loved and looked after prior to this happening to her'

Lexi, who was moments away from dying following the attack, has since had a series of operations to stitch up her wounds and is now on the road to recovery.

Her carers at the charity rescue centre said: ‘Lexi is a well-behaved sweet natured little girl who’s (sic) tail never stops wagging.

‘She’s a little star … an amazing family dog.’
