The tides have turned.

China surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest trader of goods in 2012, government statistics from both countries show.

America’s imports and exports of goods last year amounted to $3.82 trillion, the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Friday, while China’s total trading of goods last year amounted to $3.87 trillion, the country’s customs administration reported in January.

‘It is remarkable that an economy that is only a fraction of the size of the U.S. economy has a larger trading volume,’ Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told Bloomberg News on Sunday.

Total U.S. trade amounted to $4.93 trillion in 2012, including imported and exported services, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday.

The U.S. recorded a $193 billion surplus in services traded and a $700 billion deficit in goods traded last year, while China recorded a $231.1 billion trade surplus, measured in goods.

Despite China’s size and enormous 
population, the U.S. economy is twice as large as China’s economy, 
according to figures from the World Bank.

U.S. gross domestic product reached $15 trillion in 2011, while China’s GDP totaled $7.3 trillion.

China began focusing on trade and foreign investment to boost its economy after decades of seclusion, similar to modern-day North Korea, under communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

Zedong governed the East Asian country as Chairman of the Communist Party of China until his death in September, 1976.

China’s economic growth averaged 9.9 per cent a year from 1978 through 2012, according to Bloomberg.

China surpassed Germany to become the world’s largest exporter in 2009.

The U.S. remains the world’s largest importer, with a recorded $2.28 trillion in imported goods last year compared with China’s $1.82 trillion in imports.

China’s growing influence in the global marketplace could disrupt regional trading blocs as China becomes the most important commercial trading partner for some countries, economists and analysts say.
