First it was the headquarters of Sony Pictures, then it was the Xbox and Playstaion networks, followed by the social media accounts of U.S. Central Command.

Now it seems hackers have turned their sights to smaller targets after a traffic sign in downtown Los Angeles was altered to say: 'Read a f****** book.'

Drivers at the interchange between South Hope Street and 4th Avenue in were left doing a double-take after the blunt message appeared on a digital sign placed next to road works.

Blunt: Hackers targeting a Wifi-enabled road sign in downtown LA managed to change a message warning of possible traffic delays to say 'Read a f****** book' instead

A spokesman for Traffic Management Incorporated, which is in charge of the sign, confirmed that it had been hacked and had its initial message about possible journey delays changed.

The spokesman said it is possible to connect to the sign over Wifi, so the hacker could have been using a laptop or smartphone to change the message.

A second sign further down the road was also changed to carry the same offensive message

But she added that it was also possible to walk up to the sign and change the message manually.

Journalist Daina Beth Solomon, who initially tweeted an image of the sign, confirmed that another one a few blocks away had also had its message changed.

However the offensive message has now been cleared from both of the signs.

Hackers have been hitting the headlines recently after a series of high-profile attacks hit corporations and government agencies.

Sony Pictures had a set of confidential employee details and embarrassing email exchanges between senior staff leaked in the run-up to Christmas.

The hack, which means Sony Picture's network is still out of action, was though to be carried out by cyber-spies working for North Korea.

The movie-house was in the midst of launching The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of dictator Kim Jong-Un, when the attack took place.

On Christmas Day Sony was targeted again, along with Microsoft, by a group known as theÂ Lizard Squad, who knocked the Playstataion and Xbox online networks down for several days.

The anonymous group brought the systems down just as millions of gamers were trying to play on the new consoles they had just been bought for Christmas.

High-profile hackers have hit the headlines in recent months, including just two days ago after the social media accounts of U.S. Central Command were taken over by people claiming sympathy with ISIS

The group said it had performed the attack for a laugh, and to teach people the value of spending time with their families during the festive holidays.

Islamic State affiliated jihadis also broke into the social media accounts of the U.S. Central Command on Monday night, changing images to black flags associated with radial Islam.

They also posted several videos containing content sympathetic to ISIS, as well as publishing the addresses of serving American soldiers.
