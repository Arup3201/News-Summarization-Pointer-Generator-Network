This afternoon the leaders of Greece (George Papandreou, pictured), France and Germany are to discuss ways to contain the debt crisis and prevent it from further shaking up global financial markets

As fears grow of an imminent debt default by Greece world leaders have urged Europe to prevent the euro area debt crisis from spiralling out of control.

Both U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao have issued warnings about the implications of a default.

President Obama said 'more effective co-ordinated fiscal policy' is needed by the euro area states and Mr Wen said Beijing was 
willing to help, but Europe must 
stop the crisis from growing.

This afternoon Greece, France and Germany are to discuss ways to contain the debt crisis and prevent it from further shaking up global financial markets.

Fears in recent days that Greece was heading rapidly towards a chaotic default have sent the interest rates on 10-year government bonds soaring to new record highs.

Today they were 25.3 per cent, more than 23 points higher than the German equivalent, suggesting investors have all but given up on Greece being able to fix its public finances.

The main fear of a Greek bankruptcy is that it could destabilise other financially troubled European countries, potentially causing a defaults in Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Italy. It would also have a knock-on effect on banks, many of which are which are large holders of Greek government bonds.

Moody's rating agency downgraded the credit ratings of two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, after a period of huge volatility in the markets as investors fret about exposure to Greek debt.

However, the downgrade seems to have sparked some optimism on the market. After a shaky start to trading, the FTSE 100 is up 93 points at 5267, the Nasdaq up 1.49 per cent, the French CAC up 1.98 per cent and German DAX up 1.98 per cent.

Credit Agricole is also up around 3.1 per cent.

Italy meanwhile gave final
approval to a 54billion euro austerity package today, 
although the plan has so far done little to reverse investor alarm 
over whether the country can manage its debts.

Rome was dragged deeper into the crisis yesterday, with borrowing costs hitting a 
record high at a crucial bond auction as confidence in the nation’s 
finances tumbled.

Economy

A Greek exit from the single currency would lead to 'financial and economic disaster', Citigroup has warned. The main fear is a full debt default could de-stabilise other financially troubled European countries, potentially causing a domino effect of defaults in Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Italy.

The eurozone is the UK's major trading partner and the shockwaves of this could easily send the UK tumbling back into recession and markets back into turmoil reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis.

Britain could be hit with losses of up to £366billion from the collapse of the Greek economy. The potential devastation of banks and other City institutions would be equal to 24 per cent of our annual national output, or £14,640 for every family in the UK, according to Fathom Financial Consulting.

Banks

The real danger to British banks from Greece is not direct exposure but the unknown contagion effect.

British banks say they have 'only' £2.5billion of exposure to Greek government debt, while the Bank of England says the potential losses would be £8billion. Royal Bank of Scotland, 83 per cent owned by the UK taxpayer, has set aside £733million for losses on its £1.4billion holdings of Greek bonds.

But more importantly, Greek default could bring events to a head in the far bigger economies of Italy and Spain, where British banks have greater exposure. Meanwhile, the cost of borrowing on international markets would spike, laying the conditions for credit crisis II.

The industry remains in a fragile state after the last banking collapse and further big losses would once again raise fears about solvency. Last time, the Government was forced to step in to save vast swathes of the industry. To do so again would pulverize public finances and leave the Government’s financial credibility in tatters. That outcome would eventually take the UK down the same route as southern Europe and Ireland, with international markets demanding far more drastic cuts than the Coalition would dream of doing by choice.

Government

In terms of direct bailouts, its’ all down to the European Union and the IMF.  Chancellor George Osborne has insisted Britain would not contribute any more money to Greece.

The British Government has a relatively small direct exposure to Greek government debt, standing at roughly $3billion.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's 
government tabled a confidence motion which have would force it to resign
 if it lost the austerity vote.

Credit markets are already factoring in a 90 per cent 
chance of a Greek default.

In a three-way conference call later today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy will press Athens to honour its national austerity pledges in return from more bail-out cash from Europe.

The alternative, the Greek government is being warned, is national bankruptcy and a rupture in the single currency.

Greece
 has warned it will run out of cash in a few weeks and needs an 8 billion euro tranche next month to pay wages and pensions.

It follows the crippling downgrading of two French banks this morning because of their exposure to Greek debt by credit rating agency Moody's.

Credit Agricole was cut from Aa1 to Aa2 and Societe Generale from Aa2 to Aa3. This morning, shares in the two giants fell 4 per cent.

A
 third bank, BNP Paribas, was kept on review for a possible downgrade. 
The move has raised fears of a fresh crisis in the banking sector.

However, in the face of speculation about a Greek exit from the euro, European
 Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso insisted the answer to the 
growing threat to the currency was a more, not less, integrated European
 Union.

Speaking  before he addressed the European Parliament, Mr Barroso said the debt crisis has turned into a 'fight for European integration'.

He said: 'This is a fight for the jobs and prosperity of families in all our 
member states.

'This is a fight for the economic and political future of 
Europe.

'This is a fight for what Europe represents in the world. This is
 a fight for European integration itself.'

He
 defended the Greek government - widely accused of failing to implement 
planned austerity measures - saying it had taken significant steps to 
deliver on its commitments.

But UKIP leader Nigel Farage slammed the 'Troika' as a group of 'part-time overseas dictators' telling the Greeks what to do.

He
 said: 'Unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and 
political prison, you may well spark a revolution in that country.'

Deputy
 Prime Minister Nick Clegg today dismissed suggestions that Britain 
should take the opportunity presented by the crisis to renegotiate its 
relations with the EU.

He 
said: 'On a day like today, when people have been talking openly about 
the possibility of a Greek default, the key question is not, how do we 
seek to renegotiate the United Kingdom's place in the European Union in a
 threat that hasn't even materialised yet.'

Greek prime minister George Papandreou
 is expected to ask Germany and France for the debt swap to go ahead. It
 was a key part in a planned, second bailout for the cash-strapped 
country which was agreed by EU leaders in July.

Under
 its provisions, private investors are expected to share the cost of the
 rescue plan, by exchanging their Greek government bonds with 
longer-maturity, lower-coupon paper.

The Centre for Economics and Business Research said it had modelled good and bad scenarios and Italy could not support its debt even if bond rates fall back - unless the eurozone's third-largest economy sharply increases growth. Low growth in Italian is causing grave problems for the Government in financing its national debt, which stands at a massive 120 per cent of GDP.The recent hikes in the rates Italy has had to pay investors to take government debt off their hands is an unsettling echo of the pressures that forced Ireland, Greece and Portugal to seek a rescue from eurozone partners and the IMF and raised the prospect that the country could actually default on their debts. For heavily indebted eurozone members, seven per cent is the 'line of death'. That is the yield on Government bonds - the price demanded by investors - above which the country concerned is believed to be in deep trouble. Italy's at the moment stands at a record 5.6 per cent.

Greek newspaper Kathimerini said without citing sources:
 'The PM will ask the two leaders to increase pressure to their banks to
 the take part in the PSI (private-sector involvement)'       

The conference call between Mr Papandreou, Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel is scheduled to take place at about 4pm.

Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos has asked his counterparts in 57 
countries to tell him by September 9 how many of their banks intend to 
take part in the debt swap.

Greece has said it might cancel the transaction if less than 90 per cent of bondholders take part.

Bankers said last week the take-up rate was at about 70 per cent.

Kathimerini reported, also without citing any sources, that Venizelos told a government meeting on Tuesday 27 countries, including some large European ones, have not yet responded.

The euro has declined against the dollar and yen due to concern over Greece’s debt problems which will raise borrowing costs for other countries in the region.

The euro fell 0.5 per cent to 104.75 yen this morning in London from 105.25 in New York yesterday -it reached 103.90 on Sept. 12, the lowest since June 2001.
