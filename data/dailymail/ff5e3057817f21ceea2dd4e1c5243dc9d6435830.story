After his turn as Mr Darcy, Colin Firth’s fans were, to put it delicately, rather eager to relieve him of that wet shirt.

These days, however, they are more likely to want to sit him down for a proper home-cooked meal.

The Oscar-winning actor, 52, seemed far slimmer than usual as he attended a launch party thrown by designer Tom Ford in Mayfair, with his face and neck looking a little gaunt.

But fans can rest easy about his health – his weight loss is for a movie role.

Firth, who looked smart in a suit and black-framed glasses, has shed pounds to play a prisoner of war in upcoming film The Railway Man.

It is based on the true story of British officer Eric Lomax, played by Firth, who is captured by the Japanese during the Second World War and forced to work on the Thai-Burma railway.

Firth has previously spoken about how mastering a character’s physical appearance is key to his acting method.

He said: ‘Some people spend days, weeks even, getting inside a character, getting under his skin, working out how he thinks, what makes him tick.

‘My secret is that I get outside the character. Take my character in [2009 film] A Single Man: it’s the big glasses that draw you in, make George’s anguish believable.’
