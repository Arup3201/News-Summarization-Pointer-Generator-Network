Cristiano Ronaldo sparked rumours that he and girlfriend Irina Shayk may have married in secret when he referred to her as 'my wife' in an emotional acceptance speech after being crowned the FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time.

The 28-year-old sportsman was joined by both Russian model girlfriend Irina, also 28, and his three-year-old son Cristiano Junior as he claimed the coveted Ballon d’Or at the ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland, on Monday night.

Overwhelmed by the honour, Ronaldo struggled to control his emotions, bursting into tears as he took to the stage alongside his little boy to accept his prize.

Something to tell us? Cristiano Ronaldo sparked rumours he and girlfiend Irina Shayk may have wed in secret as he called her his 'wife' during his Ballon d'Or acceptance speech on Monday night

In
 his tearful acceptance speech, Ronaldo said: 'First of all I have to 
stay a great thanks to all of my team mates with the club and the 
national team. Without all their efforts this would not have been 
possible. I am very happy, it is very difficult to win this award.

'Everybody
 that has been involved with me on a personal level I have to thank. My 
wife, my friends, my son. It is a tremendously emotional moment.'

A spokesperson for Irina declined to comment on the reports when contacted by MailOnline.

Wearing a Dsquared2 Classic custom made grey tuxedo, Ronaldo was honoured after 
scoring 66 goals in 56 appearances for club and country Portugal in 2013,
 as he finally reclaimed the trophy he last held in 2008.

The footballer's second win also means that he has broken the stranglehold of his great adversary Lionel Messi.

On his rivalry with Messi, Ronaldo said: 'I have a very professional relationship with Messi, he's a player I admire.

'I'm
 happy to compete with the best. I'm going to try win things with Madrid
 and the national team, and I hope to be here (again next year) and 
win.'

Messi had held 
exclusive rights to the award in recent seasons as he became the first 
player to win the Ballon d'Or four consecutive times.

He
 too had another memorable year in 2013, but it was not quite enough to 
see him claim a fifth successive gong and he hailed Ronaldo as a just 
winner.

'I want to 
congratulate Cristiano because he was the winner and deservedly so. I 
think it was a good year for the three of us and that's why we were 
there.

'I have nothing to 
complain about or make any excuses,' said the 26-year-old, who again 
caught the attention at the gala with his fashion choice as he wore a 
shiny burgundy three-piece suit.
