Exploring for gas using 'fracking' can continue safely even though it is likely to cause further earthquakes, a Government-commissioned report says.

The technique of hydraulic fracturing is used to extract gas from shale rocks – potentially easing the country’s energy problems.

Work was suspended a year ago by the firm Cuadrilla Resources following two small earthquakes at its site in Lancashire.

While the report says these quakes - which measured 1.5 and 2.3 on the magnitude - were caused by the drilling, it concludes that further tremors would not be big enough to cause damage because they would not exceed three on the Richter Scale.

Cuadrilla believes there could be 200 trillion cubic feet of  shale gas underneath the site – enough to meet Britain’s gas needs for the next 50 years.

Even if the firm can extract only a fraction of it, it would still have an impact comparable to the exploitation of North Sea oil.

Yesterday's report was rejected by anti-fracking campaigners who fear bigger earthquakes and the contamination of water supplies.

Fracking involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into shale rock down a 9,000ft deep pipeline at high pressure to release gas.

Cuadrilla hopes to establish at least 800 drilling wells on 80 sites in Lancashire. 

With a final decision on fracking to be made by the Department of Energy in six weeks, the report is seen as a crucial step toward what would be the biggest gas-drilling operation in Europe.

Exploratory drilling licences have also been handed out in South Wales and Cheshire, with Sussex and Kent next in line.

The report recommends one of the strictest monitoring regimes in the world. Any tremor over 0.5 in magnitude would trigger the removal of the fracking fluid while an investigation is held.

The independent report was carried out by experts from Keele University and the British Geological Survey.

They said magnitude 3 quakes were commonly caused by coal-mining and still take place regularly without impact.

But they also recommended one of the strictest monitoring regimes in the world.

Any
tremor greater than a tiny 0.5 magnitude would trigger the removal of 
the fracking fluid – called ‘flowback’ - until it is investigated.

The
report said this would be a ‘prudent threshold value’, to reduce the 
likelihood of much bigger quakes. They will also try to use less 
fracking fluid to limit the pressure building up underground.

In
the USA where shale gas has been extracted for years, it has 
transformed the energy landscape – making them an exporter of gas. 
Britain imports most of its gas from Norway and Qatar.

A
final decision on fracking will be made by the Department of Energy and
Climate Change in six weeks, but the report is seen as a crucial step 
towards what is set to be the biggest gas-drilling operation in Europe.

Cuadrilla’s Chief Executive Mark 
Miller said: ‘We are pleased that the experts have come to a clear 
conclusion that it is safe to allow us to resume hydraulic fracturing, 
following the procedures outlined in the review... we have already 
started to implement a number of them in the pursuit of best practice’

The
Department of Energy and Climate Change’s chief scientific advisor 
David MacKay said: ‘If shale gas is to be part of the UK’s energy mix we
need to have a good understanding of its potential environmental 
impacts and what can be done to mitigate those impacts.

‘This comprehensive independent expert review of Cuadrilla’s evidence suggests a set of robust measures to make sure any future seismic risks are minimised – not just at this location but at any other potential sites across the UK.’

Nathan Roberts of the campaign group Frack Off said: ‘They are clearly going to allow this to go ahead. Earthquakes much bigger than this have been caused by fracking, and that is just one of many problems with it.

‘There is evidence from wells in the USA that the cement pipes erode and toxic chemicals can get into shallow water supplies, as well as air pollution, and what to do with the waste fluid which can bring up radioactive chemicals from the shale.’ Friends of the Earth executive director Andy Atkins said the inquiry was too limited, and that continuing dependence on gas would undermine the Government’s efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Blackpool could be just the beginning. Exploratory drilling licences have been handed out in Lancashire, South Wales and Cheshire, and Cuadrilla has taken steps towards drilling in the Weald Basin in Sussex and Kent.
