Alan Shearer says he does not hold much hope for former club Newcastle United and fears a ‘long, hard season’ lies ahead.

The Magpies are without a win this term and reside in the bottom three going into Saturday’s home game with Leicester City.

Manager Alan Pardew has seen off intense speculation surrounding his future - at least in the short-term - and retains the support of owner Mike Ashley.

But Shearer has not been impressed by performances on the pitch. Indeed, his hometown team have collected just 20 points from a possible 78 since the turn of the year.

He told the Chronicle: ‘It has been poor since January this year,’ said the club’s record goalscorer, who netted 206 times during 10 years on Tyneside.

‘I’m exactly the same as the fans at the minute - I’m one of them.

‘I pay for my ticket and I’m the same. I am entitled to my opinion.

‘It hasn’t been pleasant watching to be honest.

‘I don’t hold too much hope for us this season. I think it could be a long, hard season for us.’

And Shearer says there are no mitigating circumstances for Pardew or the club to put forward as an excuse for results, admitting there is a real danger they could be dragged in to a relegation battle.

‘Nobody can make any excuses,’ added Shearer, speaking ahead of the 206 Dinner in Newcastle next month.

‘The simple fact is we haven’t been good enough. You can make whatever excuses you want. Injuries, too many games or confidence.

‘Put all of that to one side, the simple fact of the matter is we just have not been good enough.

‘We haven’t been unlucky. We haven’t been ravaged by injuries. We haven’t been done by dodgy decisions.

‘We just haven’t been good enough. It’s simple. That’s the harsh reality of it.

‘Things have to improve and they have to improve pretty quickly or we could find ourselves in a hole.

‘The quicker we can get out of it the better.’
