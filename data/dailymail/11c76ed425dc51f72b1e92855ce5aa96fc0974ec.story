A pub chef quit his job because he has an all-consuming fear of baked beans.

Father-of-one Rob Griffiths said he could no longer face making fry-ups with the 'orange devils', which forced him hide whenever they were on the hob.

The 31-year-old said at one point he could not even walk down the tinned goods aisle in Tesco because he was so scared.

Horror: Rob Griffiths, 31, feels faint if he encounters 'orange devil' baked beans and has to flee the room

Mr Griffiths, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, is thought to be one of the few people in the world with a chronic fear of baked beans, or leguminophobia.

'If you put a baked bean near me I’m likely to be sick,' he said. 'I get shaky, I have to just escape, I have to just run.

'The smell of them just really, really weirds me out. At one point I couldn’t go down the aisle in Tesco because of the beans.

'I couldn’t go into cafes or anything like that because people would be having fry ups. Just the thought of it would horrify me.

'I used to be a pub chef and breakfast was hard. I had to get my waiting staff to prepare the beans while I hid in the back.'

After quitting his pub job Mr Griffiths started working as a window cleaner.

He said his 11-year-old daughter Genie-May and girlfriend Emma Beckett are understanding of his fear - but not everyone is so kind.

'Obviously a lot of people 
would wind me up about it,' he said.

'People have heard about it and actually 
started chasing me around the house with them. It is very distressing.'

Nowadays Mr Griffiths says his fear is less severe than it used to be and he is interested in discovering what caused it.

'I think the fear has 
developed from my brothers,' he said. 'They used to throw food at me and I think 
they used to throw beans and then I developed this fear.'

Professor Sir Cary Cooper, a leading behavioural psychologist at Lancaster University Management School, said: 'It does sound strange and unusual, but people can develop phobias towards pretty much anything.

'He needs to unpack why he has this phobia in the first place and if it does go back to childhood then why did having beans thrown at him bother him so much.

'This does sound like a classic phobia and it is quite serious actually. There are ways of getting help to get over it, whether it is through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, desensitivity training or something else. Help is out there if he wants it.'
