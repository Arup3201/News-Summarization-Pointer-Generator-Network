A man accused of stealing from a shop claims he thought the goods were free because of the store's name - Finders Keepers.

Ruben Pavon was caught on CCTV taking a grill from the front porch of the store in Derry, New Hampshire.

Mr Pavon admits taking the grill as well as a DVD player but he claims he believed the items were free because he took the shop's name literally.

He told WCVB.com: 'I thought it was there for the taking. The sign did say "Finders Keepers" so I took a DVD player, took it home.

'A couple of weeks later, the stuff is still there on the porch, so I'm thinking to myself, "Finders Keepers. They probably just put stuff out there for people to take".'

But the owner of Finders Keepers, Laura Barker, said she doesn't believe his claim.

She said: 'I don't know of any stores where there's free stuff. It would be nice if there were. I'd be there on a regular basis myself.

'I've never seen him in the store. He didn't appear to try and open the door to see if we were open, if anybody was there, if anyone was even there to help him load it. Because the lights were off. So I assume he knew that nobody was there.'

Mr Pavon has returned all the items to the store. Local police are continuing to investigate the incident but so far no criminal charges have reported.
