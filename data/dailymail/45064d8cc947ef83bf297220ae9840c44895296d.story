A six-year-old transgender girl from Argentina has been granted new identification and will now be registered in her gender of choice.

Lulu was born a boy named Manuel, but the young child has never identified as such and has referred to herself as a girl all her life.

She has now been given new registration papers by the Buenos Aires provincial government, listing her as a girl.

According to her mother Gabriela, Lulu
 chose the gender as soon as she first learned to speak and has insisted
 on being called Lulu since she was just four years old, local media 
reported.

Last year, 
Argentina put in place liberal rules on changing gender, allowing people
 to alter their gender on official documents without first having to 
receive a psychiatric diagnosis or surgery.

The term transgender refers to people who identifies with a different gender to that which he or she was born as.

Just herself: Lulu has been referring to herself as a girl since she could speak and never identified with 'Manuel' or being a boy

The
 term transgender includes those who refer to themselves as transsexual,
 trans, genderqueer etc. as well as both those who go through gender 
reassignment surgery and take hormones and those who simply see 
themselves as a different gender but do not want to go through any form 
of therapy or physical change.

Identifying as a different gender as the one which you were born into is called gender dysphoria and in order to legally change identity in many countries, a psychological diagnosis of gender dysphoria is needed.

With the passing of the
 Gender Recognition Act in 2004, British transgender are allowed to 
apply to the gender recognition panel for legal recognition of their 
acquired gender.
