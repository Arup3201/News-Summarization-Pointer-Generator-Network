Microsoft is to give its Office software away for free to mobile users in a fresh bid to take on Google and Apple.

The firm previously charged users of its Office suite of applications on Apple's iPad to pay a subscription to edit documents.

Today it revealed iPhone versions of the apps, and a beta version of an Android version.

The firm previously charged users of its Office suite of applications on Apple's iPad to pay a subscription to edit documents.

New Chief Executive Satya Nadella's first major move after taking the helm in February
was to make Office available on the iPad, which has attracted 40
million users.

By downloading a free app, users could read Office documents
in Word, Excel and PowerPoint but had to buy a subscription,
starting at $7 per month, to create or edit them. 

From Thursday,
that will now be free.

The move is the latest, and one of the most dramatic, in
Microsoft's new strategy of getting customers to use their
services regardless of device or operating system, rather than
lose them to a proliferation of free or cheap alternatives.

The new strategy, led by new Chief Executive Satya Nadella,
is a recognition that the dominance of Windows and Office on PCs
has not translated to the fast-growing mobile arena, where
Apple's phones and tablets and devices running Google Inc's
 Android rule.

Microsoft also announced on Thursday it is releasing Word,
Excel and PowerPoint apps for the iPhone for the first time, and
rolling out a test version of those apps for Android tablets,
which are expected to be released fully early next year.

'Anytime someone has an idea or an inspiration, we want to empower them to take action,' said John Case, corporate vice president, Office, Microsoft. 

'With over a billion Office customers worldwide, and over 40 million downloads on the iPad, it's clear that Office applications are what people want to use to get things done.' 

New Chief Executive Satya Nadella's first major move after taking the helm in February was to make Office available on the iPad, which has attracted 40million users.

When the iPad launch was revealed, Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted his congratulations to the team, saying 'Welcome to the #iPad and @AppStore! @satyanadella and Office for iPad' 

The world's largest software company still has not released
fully touch-optimized Office apps for Windows, but hinted on
Thursday that they would be released with Windows 10 sometime
next year.

Microsoft's Office suite is still the gold standard for work
applications on the PC, but easy to use, touch-friendly work
apps like Haiku Deck, Quip, Smartsheet and Evernote, plus a full
range of Google Apps, have quickly gained a following among
younger users who regularly create and consume content on mobile
devices.

On Thursday, business networking site LinkedIn Corp 
said it would integrate Haiku Deck - a free alternative to
Microsoft's PowerPoint - into its SlideShare platform, where 70
million users create and share presentations.
