Kemo Anthony Porter, 18, has been charged with four counts of murder. He will appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

Steve Chappell, chief crown prosecutor
at CPS East Midlands, said lawyers had decided there was sufficient 
evidence to charge and that it was in the public interest for a 
prosecution to take place.

He said: 'It is important to note that proceedings are now active, and the accused is entitled to a fair trial.

'Nothing should be said or reported that would prejudice that right.'

Police and firefighters were called to the building in the Spinney Hills area of the city at about 12.35am on Friday last week

Assistant Chief Constable Roger Bannister, of Leicestershire Police, said: 'l would like to thank the people of Leicester for their support during this complex investigation and for coping so patiently with the disruption during this investigation and that of the murder of Antoin Akpom on Kent Street.

'As a chief officer with Leicestershire Police I will continue to oversee the investigation and the wider impact on people in the city but the day to day investigation will continue to be run by the senior investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Kate Meynell.

'People will be pleased to hear that, of course, the specialist support we have already provided to both of the victims' families will continue.

'We recognise how important it is for that support and it is actually normal practice for us to do that.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
