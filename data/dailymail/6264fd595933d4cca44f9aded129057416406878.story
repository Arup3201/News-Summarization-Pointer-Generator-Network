This is the moment a man led his two horses across a railway line seconds before a speeding train passed.

The man and his white and brown horses narrowly missed being hit by the train which was hurtling towards them as they crossed the train tracks at Shotton low-level railway station in Flintshire, Wales.

A local councillor contacted police after spotting the near-miss, suggesting the consequences of his actions could have been ‘catastrophic’.

The man managed to safely cross the low-lying tracks with his horses but just seconds after reaching the safety of the verge, a train passed at a speed of up to 75mph.

Councillor Elwyn Jones said: ‘I couldn’t believe someone would take such a risk.

‘The horses were stalling as they were crossing and I thought it could have led to the derailing of a train.

‘Within a minute of them getting off the track, a speeding train came through. The consequences could have been catastrophic. I can’t believe somebody would be so stupid to take risks like this.’

British Transport Police officers have now warned of the dangers of crossing railway lines and urged members of the public to take care at level crossings.   

In a statement, a spokesman said: ‘I cannot emphasise enough the dangers associated with this type of behaviour.

‘Anyone who trespasses on to the railway is taking a gamble with their own lives, as well as the lives of the staff and passengers travelling on the trains.

‘People may think they know the lines well and know the passenger timetables, but they don’t know the freight timetables, with services running 24 hours a day.

‘Modern trains are also deceptively quiet and travel at extremely high speeds and, clearly, cannot swerve to avoid people in their path. You can’t outrun a train. It’s on you before you know it.

‘Luckily on this occasion, no one was injured - but the scenario could easily have been different.’

Others have also been caught on camera crossing railway lines or level crossings when trains are approaching at high speed.

In 2009, an impatient mother ignored a red warning light at a level crossing at Wareham station in Dorset and began to cross the tracks with her baby in a pram.

While other pedestrians waited patiently for the train to pass, she carelessly decided to cross the tracks despite the fact a train was accelerating towards her.

She was forced to break into a run to reach the other side safely, leaving observers stunned and horrified.

In another incident, a cyclist came within inches of her life while trying to dash across a level crossing at Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire.

The unnamed woman ducked under the level crossing barrier and ignored warning signs as she attempted to cross the tracks in September last year.

However, she appeared to realise at the last minute that she wouldn't safely  make the crossing and pulled her bike back suddenly as the train hurtled past at a speed of up to 75mph.

Network Rail has regularly warned of the dangers of this type of behaviour and has run several campaigns, including 'Would It Kill You To Wait?' in an attempt to deter reckless actions.
