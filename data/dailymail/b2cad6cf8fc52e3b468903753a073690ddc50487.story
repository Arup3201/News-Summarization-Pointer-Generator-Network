A teenage girl has been accused of recruiting her girlfriends to have sex with a 62-year-oldÂ  businessman for money.

Chelsey Elizabeth Taylor, 17, pushed her friends into prostitution, according to police and prosecutors in Webster, Texas.

The League City high school student solicited her 'easily manipulated' friends to provide sex for Michael Wayne McIntosh at his home in Friendswood this past summer, according to Galveston County prosecutor Adam Poole.

Webster police detective David Nettles says the student would drive the girls to McIntosh's home and receive a percentage of more than $3,600 paid to the girls.

The girls would call the 62-year-old 'Money Mike' and according to court documents, Taylor brought younger girls to have sex with him because she hated him and believed the girls would 'take one for the team'.

Police say the friends were as young as 14 when they were allegedly brought to the house for sex.

McIntosh's neighbor, Lindsay Diekman, told ABC: 'I mean, they're young, real skinny girls -- different girls all the time.'

The alleged teen madam is charged with compelling prostitution. She's free on $40,000 bond.

McIntosh is charged with three counts of sexual assault on a child and is free on $120,000 bond.

Police have so far identified eight victims with more potentially still to come forward.
