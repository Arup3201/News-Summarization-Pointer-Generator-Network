The military leader of the pro-Russian separatist movement in Ukraine has stepped down in a shock resignation, it has emerged. 

Igor Girkin - known as Strelkov - has headed up the military faction since the conflict broke out last year. His is the third resignation of rebel leaders in the past week. 

It comes as Vladimir Putin revealed he plans to equip the former Red Army with secret weapons which the West does not possess in a gargantuan £335 billion defence spending programme.

The move will likely impact the damage to Russia's relations with the West, which have suffered the worst breakdown since the end of the Cold War. 

Mr Strelkov's departure was confirmed by Alexander Borodai, the former premier of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic

But he denied claims Mr Strelkov had been wounded, and gave no reason for the move.

In the past seven days, Mr Borodai has also stepped aside - handing over to Alexander Zakharchenko.

The rebel leader in Luhansk, Valery Bolotov has 'temporarily' given his role to defence minister Igor Plotnitskiy.

Addressing the latest resignation, Mr Borodai told local media: 'You probably already know that he, like myself, has left his post.

Plans: Vladimir Putin plans to plug the former Red Army with £335 billion, he has revealed, by arming them with secret weapons which the West does not possess as tensions with the West intensify

'The Donetsk People's Republic already has a new defence minister.' 

'This is about the most modern arms, offensive and defensive systems that other armies do not have so far,' he told lawmakers.

'Some things are already well-known in the field of strategic offensive weapons - I mean nuclear deterrent forces.

'There are some things that we are not talking about yet, but let's say, the time will come.'

Putin said without revealing details that he wanted to 'cheer up' his Western 'partners' with the new weapons and 'bringing them to life'.

'This is not militarization, but a very serious additional impulse to the development of the defence industry,' he claimed in a speech in Crimea, annexed in March after a major army operation.

He also warned of the danger of Pakistan developing medium range nuclear arms.

'The development of this class of weapon in Pakistan can only cause us certain alarm, because - let's be frank - we understand that this is a country with a complex political regime,' he said.

He was concerned by 'what happens there, how the situation will evolve, and in whose hands these weapons will end up - especially as this is a nuclear power.

'And there are questions about other countries, many of them, while we have been restricting ourselves. Of course, we will think about this and analyse it.'

Putin has frequently expressed worries about installations linked to a US missile shield in eastern Europe.
