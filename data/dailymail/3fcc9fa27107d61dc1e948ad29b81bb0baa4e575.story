It has been left crumbling away for more than 20 years - with its iconic wooden features, art deco styling and industrial equipment hidden from public view.

But now, thousands of people have been given a rare chance to take a look inside Battersea Power Station - one of London's best-loved landmarks.

The historic building, which sits on the banks of the River Thames, was today revealed to the public for the last time before it undergoes a radical multi-billion pound redevelopment across the whole site.

Iconic: Thousands of people have been given a rare chance to take a peek inside Battersea Power Station, which sits on the banks of the River Thames in London

Derelict: The historic building has been left crumbling away for more than 20 years, with its wooden features, art deco styling and equipment hidden from public view

Last chance: The power station was today revealed to the public for the last time before it undergoes a radical multi-billion pound redevelopment across the whole site

Visitors were able to view and take photos of the famous red brick building, which was built in 1933 and, 50 years later, decommissioned in 1983. It has since been left in a derelict, ruined state.

Robert Deas, 49, from Richmond in south-west London, said:  'This is the last chance any of us will have to see Battersea Power Station.

'We've all been looking at it as we've
commuted over the Thames for years, wondering what's inside, and now at
last we get a chance to see.'

However, some of those waiting to enter the power station criticised
the queuing system, which saw two lines - one running along the promenade
at Battersea Park, and another down Queenstown Road - meet near the 
entrance.

The Grade II listed structure, which was built in 1933, now faces redevelopment into offices and flats

Speaking from outside the building, Mr Deas said: 'We've been in the queue, in total, about an hour-and-a-half, and that has been poorly managed.

'There are now two queues, one running
back to Albert Bridge, and one to Vauxhall in the other direction, and 
where they meet there has been quite a lot of ill feeling.

'I think it should have been 
anticipated that most of London would want to see inside Battersea Power
Station, and I really think the whole building should have been left 
standing open for a week so that everyone could just wander in at their 
leisure.'

Ross Pike, 29, who is originally from Belfast but now lives in London, said the queue had been 'jovial'.

Historic: Battersea Power Station was decommissioned in 1983 and has since been left vacant

Ruin: Known for its landmark four chimneys, the building is now dirty, damaged and falling apart

He added: 'It's a big iconic building 
we've never been able to go into before, and before it gets cordoned off
and turned into apartments, I thought it would be a good opportunity to
look inside it, having seen it from the street for so long.'

The Grade II listed structure, which was built in two stages and is known for its landmark four chimneys, now faces redevelopment into offices and flats.

It is one of 700 landmarks throughout the capital being opened up to visitors as part of the Open House project.

Members of the public have been given rare access to some typically 'private' buildings, while others have been selected for 
their architectural significance.

Worth the wait: People queue up to view the famous red brick building, which was opened to the public as part of the Open House project

Criticism: Some of those waiting to enter the power station criticised the queuing system, deeming it 'poorly managed'

Rare access: The power station is one of 700 landmarks being opened up to visitors as part of the London-wide project

Those on the list include the King's 
Cross Station clock tower, Dr Johnson's house - where he compiled his 
famous Dictionary of the English Language - and several embassies.

The vast majority of buildings are on a
first-come basis, with thousands of people clambering to gain places to view previously unsighted historic landmarks.

However, ballots for access to some sites - including
10 Downing Street and The Shard - have already closed. Some landmarks are only open for one of the two days.
