The 16-year-old girl who survived a deadly axe-attack that claimed the lives of three family members has been released from hospital after suffering severe brain damage and a severed jugular.

Marli van Breda has been transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after leaving Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town, on Tuesday, News24 reports.

The former Perth schoolgirl has been in hospital since she was struck several times on the head and had her throat slashed in her family's South African home on January 27.

The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22.

Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town.

Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic after six weeks in hospital.  

While her health has improved, Marli has not yet been able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack. 

She has been able to talk despite her injuries, but not for long periods. 

The family have not revealed the rehabilitation centre where Marli will be treated so her recovery can go ahead without disruptions.

It comes after reports last month that visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 

'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told  The Sunday Times newspaper. 

Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother.

'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. 

It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 

'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.'

When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard.

A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack.

The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia

The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred.

A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. 

Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling.

His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze.

A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family'

'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times.

'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.'

No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard.

The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.
