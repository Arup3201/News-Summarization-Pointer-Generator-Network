Lionel Messi may arguably be the  best footballer on the planet - but he has now got a contender for the worst tattoo in the world inked on to his leg.

The Barcelona star's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo posted a picture on Instagram showing the design.

The 27-year-old's tattoo is of a sword, surrounded by roses, with a football on one side and Messi's famous 'No 10' inked on the other.
