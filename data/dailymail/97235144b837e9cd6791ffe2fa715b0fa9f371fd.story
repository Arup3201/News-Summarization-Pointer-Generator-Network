Angel di Maria is the latest in an illustrious line of Manchester United No 7s, and he has paid homage to his predecessors by visiting the club's museum.

Previous legends to have worn the No 7 shirt include George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Argentine insisted he hopes to be a club 'hero' just like they were.

Di Maria was enthusiastic about his visit to the Manchester United Museum at Old Trafford and said: 'It was great to visit the museum and learn about the club's history.'

The Argentine said he wants to become a hero at Old Trafford, like previous No 7s such as Eric Cantona

The former Real Madrid winger has made an exciting start to life at Old Trafford, with two goals in four games despite United enduring a tough start to the season.

Louis van Gaal's team host Everton on Sunday, and will want to maintain the momentum gained from last week's 2-1 win against West Ham.

The 26-year-old Di Maria is determined to succeed in Manchester and  is keen to emulate the United icons who wore the shirts before him.

He added: 'It's an honour to wear the No 7 shirt that legends like Best, Cantona, Beckham and Ronaldo did – I hope one day to also be considered a hero for the fans, just like they are.'

Eric Cantona is one of many Manchester United legends to have worn the feted No 7 shirt

The iconic midfielder George Best wore the famous shirt during his spell at the club between 1963 and 1974 

Cristiano Ronaldo, who could rejoin the club, became a global superstar wearing United's No 7 shirt

For those visiting the museum,  current exhibitions include a look back at the career of George Best, '10 years of Wayne Rooney' and 'United at War' - an examination of the Club's role during both world wars.

The Manchester United Museum is free to enter until the end of October, and  a guided tour of the stadium costs £18 for adults and £12 for juniors/concessions.
