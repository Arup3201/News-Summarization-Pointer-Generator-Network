Bloody Marys and fried food are known as two of the best hangover cures.

But a bar in Milwaukee has taken the idea to the next level - by creating a whopping Bloody Mary topped off with a whole fried chicken.

Sobelman's Pub and Grill now boasts the 'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast' on its menu - and it really is an absolute monster. 

Sobelman's Pub and Grill has created the 'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast' - an 80 ounce Bloody Mary topped off with an entire fried chicken

The 'drink' is made to feed four people, and also includes two 'Baconadoes' (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeño cheeseballs) as well as other garnishes

The drink-cum-supersize-meal is served in a jug and features four regular sized Bloody Marys, as well as cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, scallion, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two 'Baconadoes' (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeño cheeseballs) - not to mention the entire fried bird.

The price might look as hard to stomach as the concoction itself - it will set you back a whole $50 - but it is big enough to feed four people, and $5 of every sale goes to Milwaukee’s Hunger Task Force - a food charity which works in the area.

The crazy cocktail is the brainchild of Dave 'King of the Bloodies' Sobelman, who already comes with a reputation for making drinks with a delicious twist.

The whopping bloody will set you back $50, $5 of which is donated to Milwaukee’s Hunger Task Force - a food charity which works in the area

Sobelman's is famous for its brutally big bloodies - it already serves 'The Bloody Masterpiece' - a Bloody Mary with a bacon cheeseburger on top.

It is not the only bar to experiment with food-filled cocktails though - Vancouver bar the Score on Davie sells a Caesar, the Canadian take on a Bloody Mary, that not only features a whole roast chicken, but also a burger, pulled pork Sriracha-glazed slider, onion rings, chicken wings, a pulled pork mac and cheese hotdog and even a brownie.

Their effort is a monstrous 5,000 calories, costs $60 and takes 20 minutes to put together.
