Lucky: Mikey Hill, 19, fell 40 ft from a hotel balcony and only survived after landing on a car

A teenager who fell 40ft from a hotel balcony only survived after landing on a car - just days after a British mother of two fell to her death at the same resort.

Mikey Hill, 19, slipped and fell after partying with friends in the Mediterranean party resort of San Antonio in the early hours of Friday morning.

The teenager, of Wigton, Cumbria, was rushed to hospital and spent 24 hours in intensive care after suffering two punctured lungs, extensive bruising and a dislocated hip after his fall from the Hotel Brisa.

Doctors expect him to spend at least three weeks in hospital, but insisted that he is lucky to be alive and was only saved by the car.

Mother Susan, 51, said: 'He can't remember how it happened, but doctors said that it was his landing on the parked car that saved his life.

'If he had landed on the concrete, it would have been a different story. I've told him he's one lucky boy.'

As millions of jetsetting Brits travel abroad for sun-filled partying, the number of summer tragedies has rocketed in recent years.

Mikey's mother said he had been very much looking forward to what was his first lads' holiday with a group of his friends.

They arrived at the San Antonio resort on Thursday, and celebrated the start of their holiday by going out together. His fall happened at the end of the night out.

Recovery: Doctors expect him to spend at least three weeks in hospital

Susan said: 'Getting a phone call like that one on Friday afternoon is the last thing you expect.

'You hear about these things but never expect them to happen to your family. We're still in shock.

'Mikey was in intensive care for 24 hours, and I think they operated on him. He seems fine now.

'His lungs have got a drain in them to
get all the fluid out. I've spoken to him on the phone and he says he 
can't remember anything.

'The
last thing he remembers is just talking to friends, and then waking up 
in hospital. He's got some good mates around him, and they're keeping a 
close eye on him.

'He just wants to come home. I've kept telling him how lucky he is.'

Mikey works at Tynedale Farm Services in Wigton, and has three sisters, Michelle, 26, Kirsty, 29, and Emma, 32.

His
accident came just a few days after 31-year-old mum-of-two Janine 
Mallett, from Stockton-on-Tees, Durham, was found dead in the same 
holiday resort.

Party town: San Antonio where the two friends were on holiday is the clubbing capital of Ibiza

Tragic: Tourist Janine Mallett, 31, from Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesborough was found dead in the same Ibiza resort last Saturday

She was last seen alive going into the sea for a swim at 4am.

Her body was found at 11am the next day just off the holiday resort's main beach, called S'Arenal.

Just
over a year ago, a UK holiday firm said it no longer used the top floor
apartments similar to a Bulgarian one from which a Carlisle teenager 
fell to his death.

Tom McNeill, 17, from Lowry Hill, 
died in 2011 after falling 40ft from a third-floor balcony at the Black 
Sea resort of Sunny Beach. The balcony had no safety rail.

Irishman Brian Farrelly, 20, drowned 
in the swimming pool at Hotel Brisa, a two-star hotel which describes 
itself as a place with a 'youthful atmosphere', in July 2008.

Farrelly,
from Drimnagh in Dublin, drowned after jumping into the pool at his 
hotel in the party resort of San Antonio, in Ibiza.

Before
leaving for Ibiza, he wrote on his Bebe homepage: 'Goin to Ibiza on the
5th July for two weeks... Brisa Hotel, San Antonio, gonna be animal.'

Farrelly
was pulled out of the pool by police and paramedics after hotel guests 
raised the alarm. However, he was pronounced dead at the scene after 
failing to respond to attempts to revive him.

The
day before Mr Farrelly's death, he had checked into the 122-room Hotel 
Brisa along with a couple of his friends in San Antonio.
