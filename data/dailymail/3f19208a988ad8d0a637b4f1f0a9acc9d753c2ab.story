Boris Johnson’s dream of building a £100billion airport in the Thames estuary appeared to be dead in the water last night after Government advisers warned it was unrealistic.

The extravagant scheme should be dropped from a review of Britain’s future airport capacity, former CBI chief Sir Howard Davies is expected to tell ministers today.

The scheme, dubbed Boris Island, would have seen a new four-runway hub airport built in the Thames estuary with high-speed rail links to London.

The London mayor argued that, with expansion at Heathrow constrained, the idea was the only way to keep the UK competitive in terms of airport capacity.

But the independent Airports Commission, which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by  Sir Howard, will today urge  ministers to focus instead on expansion at either Heathrow  or Gatwick.

One source said the Boris Island idea would be attacked with ‘every conceivable sledgehammer’.

Mr Johnson fought hard last year to get his plan included on the Commission’s short-list in the face of scepticism from experts, who warned it was too costly and would face major environmental hurdles.

It leaves the Commission now looking at three detailed options – two for expanding Heathrow, and one for increasing capacity at Gatwick.

Heathrow’s owners have proposed building a third runway, while the second option would be to increase the length of one of the existing runways to allow it to handle more flights.

Both options are estimated to cost about £18 billion. The option to build a second runway at Gatwick would cost an estimated £9billion, but enjoys less support from the business community.

Mr Johnson yesterday described the idea of expanding Heathrow as ‘madness’.

Repeating his preference for a new site, he dismissed Heathrow plans as ‘self-defeating’ and ‘barbarically contemptuous of the rights of the population’. He added: ‘What frustrates me is that a third runway at Heathrow is so desperately short-sighted.

‘You could not conceivably get it built before 2029, by the airport’s own admission – and as soon as it opened it would be full.’ Mr Johnson said the Heathrow expansion would lead to medical problems associated with pollution, as well as congestion on the road network.

Other critics warn the plan would require the demolition  of hundreds of homes and lead to increased noise pollution in  the area.

The CBI yesterday urged the Commission to come forward quickly with a ‘spades in the ground’ solution to the lack of capacity, which it said was damaging Britain’s competitiveness.

Deputy director-general Katja Hall said: ‘It tends to be hub airports that deliver the new connections to emerging markets that we desperately need.

‘With Heathrow full and the UK slipping behind in the race for new connectivity, it is essential that the Airports Commission delivers a solution that addresses the ticking timebomb of our lack of spare hub capacity.’

David Cameron publicly opposed the expansion of Heathrow at the last election, but Heathrow will now dominate the Commission’s work. The Commission is not set to report its decision until after the election.
