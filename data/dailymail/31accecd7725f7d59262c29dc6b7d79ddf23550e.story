Manchester United youngsters Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell have joined Premier League new-boys Leicester City.

The 20-year-old Wilson was given his full league debut at the end of last season by Ryan Giggs when he started alongside James Wilson against Hull City. He signs on a four-year deal.

Wilson has not featured for United this season under Louis van Gaal, while Powell, who joins on a season-long loan, has appeared just once, in the 4-0 defeat to MK Dons last week.

Welsh forward Wilson has previously had loan spells at Carlisle and Yeovil - but a move to Leicester gives him the chance to play in the Premier League.

Powell, 20, has made just two league appearances and scored one goal since switching to Old Trafford and doesn't appear to feature in Van Gaal's plans for Manchester United's recovery this season.
