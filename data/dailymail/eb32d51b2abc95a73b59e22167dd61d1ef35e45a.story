Rental mental: Increasing numbers of young people in Britain are choosing not to buy their own properties

An Englishman's house may be his castle - but buying his own could be becoming as much a thing of the past as knights in shining armour.

New figures reveal nearly half of young Brits are 
no longer interested in owning their homes - bucking a trend that is more akin to French and German renting culture.

Today's figures come alongside news that house prices in parts of central London have rocketed by 116 per cent in the past eight years - with Mayfair homes outstripping this at a staggering 139 per cent increase in value.

This outpaces the retail price index by 
86 per cent, while the average UK house price has dropped by 19.3 per cent in real terms over the same period.

And while an overwhelming 93 per cent of Brits aged between 55 and 75 said they still saw owning their own property as the 'ultimate goal', just a third of under-35s felt the same way.

Just over half of Brits aged 35 and under live in a home they do not own, according to the survey by financial protection specialist LV=..

And found 42 per cent
of them are simply not bothered about owning their own home - 
even though many said they could afford to.

This changing outlook mirrors the culture in Germany and France, where long term renting is the norm.

Germany has the greatest proportion of renters in Europe as 61 per cent choose to rent, rather than own their home.

It
is seen as a perfectly acceptable alternative brought about largely by 
the reluctance of banks to loan money for mortgages - and it’s clear the
UK is now following suit.

Only
half of the French live in their own properties - with 52 per cent 
renting - due to a boom in property prices in recent years.

With British banks also tightening lending criteria, the notion of long term renting is gathering momentum here as well.

And while
the previous generation expected to own their first home by the age of 
25, those aged 20 to 35 said they can't see themselves putting down a deposit until
they’re at least 36.

Attitudes have changed too, with almost three quarters said the notion that it’s shameful 
to never own a property is ‘completely out of date’.

More than three quarters of tenants said 
the Government's 'Help To Buy' scheme has not motivated them to put a 
foot onto the property ladder.

And
given the latest figures from London, it's easy to see why even 
successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding 
their own place.

James
Williams is a 32-year-old IT worker from Winchester, Hampshire.

He has been renting for 
nine years and has no intention of buying his own property.

He said: 'I’m happy to continue renting at the moment. It’s such a big commitment to buy my own house.

'It’s so hard to get a mortgage from the bank these days and it’s just easier at the moment to keep renting.'

Prime
Central London - where prices have more than doubled since 2005 - is made up the affluent areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge,
Belgravia, Chelsea, Marylebone, Notting Hill, Kensington, South 
Kensington.

After Mayfair, the top performing area was Knightsbridge, where values are up 133 per
cent compared with eight years ago.

It was only in 
Kensington and South Kensington that prices didn’t more than double over
the eight-year period - although they still increased by 97 and 88 per 
cent respectively.

And last week, figures from the Halifax's monthly house price index showed a 5.4 per cent increase in the average value of a home, from £160,292 to £170,231 compared with the same period last year.

Figures from LSL Property Services released at the same time showed there had been a 45 per cent increase in the number of first-time buyers in July compared with the same month in 2012.

But today's figures show the number of renters has also risen - from 2.4 million in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2011-12.

This 58 per cent increase comes despite the rising cost of rent.

London living: Park House in South Kensington, 
which was recently declared the most expensive house in the capital at 
£105 million - 640 times the average house price

The average renter in Kensington and Chelsea is looking at a monthly cost of over £4,000 for a two-bedroom property - although in Bexley in South East London, renters can expect to pay an average of around £830 a month.

This was in comparison with the whole of the South East, where the cost of renting - £1,152 per month - consumes almost half of the average person's monthly salary, and £947 per month - 39 per cent of monthly income - in the rest of the country.

In the survey of 4,710 Brits, most of those who did not want to buy a house (17 per cent) named not
wanting to be tied down as their main reason for renting instead.

After this came being unsure about the area (13 per
cent) and having no desire to buy (10 per cent) are their main reasons.

Meanwhile, 7 per cent would rather spend their money on other things than putting it into property.

The
majority of 20 to 35 year old tenants - 72 per cent - said they were either married 
or in a relationship and earning an average of £34,084 a year.

Lucian 
Cook, director of research at Savills, described the 
increase in prime central London against the rest of the country as 'unprecedented'.

London                                                     7.2%

He said: 'Historically, the price of prime central London stock has risen 
substantially in the first half of a housing market cycle, before a 
period of catch up by the rest of the country.

'However, in the last two complete housing cycles, the overall gap has widened.

'This
outperformance reflects the fact that prime central London is driven by
different factors compared to the mainstream UK market.

'UK
mainstream residential has been largely dependent on the domestic 
economy, the supply of mortgage credit and the affordability constraints
of UK households.

'In 
contrast, prime central London demand is driven by global wealth, 
attracted to a political and economic safe haven, which is culturally 
diverse but also has a strong investment track record.

'These
attributes have been heightened over the past eight years, during which
time global wealth, particularly from emerging economies, has grown 
significantly.'

Mark
Jones, LV= head of protection, urged renters to take out insurance to guarantee repayments in case something happens to the mortgage payer.

'If you are a tenant, it is still important to have a financial back up 
plan in place which would enable you to carry on living in your home if 
you were unable to work,' he said.
