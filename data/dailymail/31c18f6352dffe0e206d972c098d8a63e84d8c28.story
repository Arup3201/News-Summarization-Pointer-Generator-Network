You don't have to be a heavy-set adult to enjoy a spot of Japanese sumo-wrestling as these fiercely competitive schoolchildren prove.

Boys of all shapes and sizes competed at the National Children's Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.

The crowd roared with delight when pint-sized Hayato Matsunaga defeated an opponent who was bigger than him.

Some of the more slight competitors may not have the bulk of their bigger counterparts, but they can still outmanoeuvre their opponents.

The
keen youngsters are among dozens of Japanese wrestlers taking part in 
the annual competition, which is popular with sporting fans across the 
country.

The Japanese consider Sumo a modern martial art, even though the sport has a history spanning back several centuries.

Sumo wrestling is a national 
obsession in Japan where the giant competitors, known as rikishis, are 
seen as national heroes and become unlikely sex symbols.

Full-sized
wrestlers can weigh well over 250kg and in order to stay in fighting 
shape they need to consume a whopping 20,000 calories a day.

As well as their enormous meals the wrestlers top up by downing around six pints of beer at every mealtime.

Rest: Although their faces were fraught with concentration and exertion during the matches, they boys smiled as they watched other opponents compete

Although the sport of Sumo has been practised for over 1000 years the Japanese consider its a modern martial art.

The bouts take place in a circular 
ring known as a dohy≈ç and the winner is the first wrestler to force his 
opponent to step out of the ring or to force them to touch the ground 
with any part of their body other than the bottom of their feet.

Tradition is extremely important and 
before each bout the wrestlers perform a ritual known as the Shiko 
exercise where they stomp their feet in order to drive away evil 
spirits.

Warming up: The first boy to touch the ground with any part of his body other than the soles of his feet loses the bout, which typically lasts less than a minute

Support: Proud parents cheer and clap from the sidelines at Sunday's competition
