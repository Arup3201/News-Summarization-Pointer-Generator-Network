She describes herself as just a ‘shy little girly girl’.

But modest Abbie Martin can today count herself among Britain’s most heroic troops.

The unassuming 20-year-old Army medic has won a gallantry award for her courage in Afghanistan.

Lance Corporal Martin received the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service after ignoring Taliban bullets whistling over her head to treat a dying colleague on her very first patrol.

A week later she saved the lives of six soldiers injured in a blast after insurgents hurled a grenade into their patrol base.

Honour: Lance Corporal Abbie Martin, a 20-year-old female Army medic who has been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service after bravely ignoring Taliban bullets whistling over her head to treat a dying colleague

She is among 118 servicemen and women who received awards in the operational honours list, published today. One is posthumous.

Most of the honours go to troops who served with 12 Mechanised Brigade in Afghanistan between March and September last year.

Lance Corporal Martin, from Haverhill, Suffolk, thought she would be working in field hospitals when she deployed to Helmand with the Royal Army Medical Corps.

But a lack of medics meant she was instead attached to the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.

Five hours into her first patrol she was embroiled in a ferocious firefight while her unit took part in an operation to disrupt insurgent activity.

Hearing the words ‘man down’ on her radio, she ran to treat his chest wounds as bullets peppered a wall behind her.

Sadly, the wounded soldier, Guardsman Michael Roland, 27, later died.

Lance Corporal Martin’s citation read: ‘Martin remained with the Guardsman throughout the casualty extraction, selflessly exposing herself to enemy fire.’

She said: ‘I’ve never been so scared in life. No one can prepare you for being shot at.

‘When you hear the bullets whizzing past your head and you know they’re close, your heart is racing and you think “What on earth am I doing here?”.

‘But you are the medic so you have to get there and save the person’s life. I remember thinking I am never going back again, not a chance.

‘But they [her comrades] need me and I need them.

Lance Corporal Martin said she was ‘so proud’ to receive an award.

‘I am so in shock,’ she said. ‘I’m such a shy little girly girl so I never thought I would achieve anything in the Army.’ 

An Army officer who fought a Taliban insurgent despite his rifle jamming and being shot himself received the Military Cross.

The Lance Corporal who saved him in the Upper Gereshk Valley, Helman Province, last July was also honoured.

Captain John Scarlett, from the Coldstream Guards, and Lance Corporal Stephen Shaw, from the Royal Army Medical Corps, were in a patrol that fell under fire after an apparent ambush at an Afghan police checkpoint.

As they were attacked by a gunman from a watchtower, three of their number were seriously wounded.

And as Captain Scarlett tried to rescue them his own rifle jammed, forcing him to use his pistol.

He was shot in the leg and body armour but dragged to safety by Lance Corporal Shaw, who gave him life-saving medical treatment, as well as later treating the other casualties.

Both men are awarded the Military Cross, given in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land.

Captain Scarlett, 26, from Dulwich, south London, said: 'It’s obviously an absolute honour to be awarded the MC, but in no way do I see this as an individual achievement.

'My initial reaction was to know what the other guys got and I was really pleased when I heard Cpl Shaw had got it.

'I wasn’t the only person whose life was saved by Cpl Shaw, he does it a lot.'

Lance Corporal Shaw, 24, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, added: 'It feels good, it’s a great honour. But it was a team effort.'

The gunman was eventually captured, and the men airlifted to safety - but the three injured soldiers died.

In his citation, 26-year-old Captain Scarlett was said to have 'displayed the very highest standards of leadership, courage, selfless commitment and gallantry.'

Lance Corporal Shaw's citation said: 'Shaw’s actions during that horrific attack were in the very finest traditions of the British Army, demonstrating conspicuous courage, commitment and professionalism.'

Brave: Lance Corporal Lawrence Kayser MC, of The Royal Anglian Regiment who has been awarded the Military Cross

A soldier who found himself just a few metres from enemy fighters hiding behind a wall risked his life to single-handedly drive them off.

Lance Corporal Lawrence Kayser of Mill Hill, London, has been awarded the Military Cross for his bravery, and patrolling for five hours afterwards despite a grenade injury.

Lance Corporal Kayser, 27, of The 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, was part of a platoon of soldiers taken by air deep into enemy territory as part of Operation Maahi Buzurg - an attempt to clear a notorious insurgent-held area.

The platoon was involved in a series of deadly battles over the next 10 days, one of which could have ended disastrously but for the soldier’s courage and quick thinking.

In the early hours of June 21 the platoon had waited for hours to ambush a known insurgent route in Gereshk Valley.

At around dawn, and by pure chance, a group of enemy fighters had positioned themselves beyond a wall in a compound just three metres away.

Moments later a single insurgent rose above the wall, only to see 20 ISAF soldiers beneath him. A ferocious fire-fight erupted.

Lance Corporal Kayser, positioned near the rear of the platoon and, nearest to the insurgent, realised all the men were now at risk from an attack coming from the adjacent compound.

He leapt from his ditch and sprinted around the wall in case Taliban were there.

His judgment proved excellent as entering the compound he came face to face with an insurgent fighter.

Both fired and luckily, while the insurgent missed him, Lance Corporal Kayser managed to clip the insurgent in the abdomen.

Lance Corporal l Kayser, who is based in Bulford, Wiltshire, pursued him before a grenade was hurled into the alleyway, landing just metres from his feet.

He was struck on the arm with shrapnel from the blast.

Despite a 'bee sting' sensation in his arm he pressed forward and the enemy fled, allowing him to clear the rest of the compound. It was only when he returned to his base five hours later that he discovered the extent of his shrapnel wounds.

He said: 'I’m humbled but I have seen a lot of brave actions in theatre so I’m not sure I’m worthy of it. I’ve never been a medal man. But my parents are ecstatic.'

An RAF sergeant who took on the Taliban when they attacked the allied forces’ main base in Afghanistan while Prince Harry was there has been awarded the Military Cross.

Sergeant Roy Geddes, 43, from Elgin, Moray, jumped in a Jackal armoured vehicle after hearing explosions and gunfire on the north eastern side of Camp Bastion airfield.

Racing to the scene his vehicle was hit by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG).

Despite sustaining a knee injury and being unable to manoeuvre, the father-of-three ignored the wound to command his men and orchestrate the defence.

The attack on Bastion happened on September 14 last year after night fell.

Fifteen insurgents, dressed in Army uniform, caused millions of pounds of damage by blowing up five Harrier jets and fuel storage areas.

The insurgents - 14 of whom were killed and one captured - were equipped with massive firepower and attacked on three fronts, injuring eight British personnel and killing two US Marines.

Sgt Geddes was finally only extracted for medical help because his squadron commander ordered it.

He said: 'This isn’t just for me, it is for the whole team.

'I couldn’t have asked any more of them on that night.'

Corporal Kurt Lee, an RAF section commander, was mentioned in despatches for his involvement in the incident.

Award: Lieutenant Commander Al Nekrews who defused a series of complex devices in Afghanistan during a 16-hour period, despite soaring temperatures and threat of attack

A Royal Navy explosives expert who defused a series of complex devices in Afghanistan during a 16-hour period, despite soaring temperatures and threat of attack, has been awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal.

Lieutenant Commander Al Nekrews, 40, is the Navy's first ever high-threat improvised explosive device (IED) operator and was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months in 2012 where he led a four-man team in Nahr-e Saraj, one of the busiest districts.

On May 25, Lieutenant Commander Nekrews, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, and his team were dispatched to the scene of an explosion that had injured a British soldier and discovered what appeared to be a rug draped over barbed wire protecting a ditch.

But the rug contained two complex devices which took 16 hours over two days to defuse manually after attempts to make them safe with a robot failed.

While the road was protected by soldiers to the north and south, Lieutenant Commander Nekrews was vulnerable to attack from the east and west which could not be covered because of the threat of further buried explosives.

On receiving the Queen's Gallantry Medal, he said: 'It was quite surreal. I am really proud of what I have achieved and my family are obviously all delighted as well.

'I should also praise the efforts of my team, Leading Diver Craig Waghorn and Sergeant Craig Simpson - I always trusted their judgment and it was invaluable to have that support.'
