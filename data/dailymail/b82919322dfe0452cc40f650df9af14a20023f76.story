Chinese officials have taken an unusual step in the fight against scrap metal thieves by starting to fit their manholes with GPS tracking devices.

Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online.

The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world.

High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves

Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values

The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street.

One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. 

It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation.

The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years.

It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone.

Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked

The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. 

A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. 

But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole.

Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'

But people derided the idea as 'stupid' because thieves just cut the chains
