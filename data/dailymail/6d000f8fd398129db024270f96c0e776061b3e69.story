Most people know that no two snowflakes are exactly alike.

But to see how they become unique hexagonal wonders requires a microscope.

Now one man has created a beautiful video showing how the flakes grow to form their hexagonal shapes in incredible detail.

A water droplet freezes around a dust particle in the air, creating an ice crystal.

More water molecules land on the crystal and create the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways to form arms.

The reason the flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals.

The precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity.

Snowflakes with long needles-like arms form in warmer temperatures, while very circular ones are created in colder climates.

Russian video maker Vyacheslav Ivanov filmed the formation of the hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘microscopic time-lapse'.

The flakes are created when a water droplet freezes around pollen or a speck of dust in the air, creating an ice crystal.

Then more water molecules land on the crystal, creating the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways along the ‘arms’.

These ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal order of the crystal’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces to form a six-sided snowflake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) explained.

The reason the flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals.

As
 the water freezes, bound-together water molecules crystallise into a 
hexagonal structure so that each point on a hexagon is an oxygen atom 
with hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom on each side, iO9 reported.

As
 the freezing process continues, more water molecules are added to the 
microscopic structure, causing it to bloom outwards along its six sides 
and transforms into what we recognise as a snowflake.

The precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity.

Long,
 needle-like crystals form at slightly warmer temperatures like-5 degrees Celsius, whereas flakes that form in cooler temperatures such as -15 degrees Celsius are flatter and more circular in shape.

In
 this way, the shape of just one arm of a snowflake is determined by the
 atmospheric conditions experience by the ice crystals as they fall to 
Earth.

Its arm might 
grow in one way and then seconds later, slight changes in the 
temperature or humidity could make it form in another way and alter the 
shape dramatically.

It 
is this sensitivity to the atmosphere – and the fact that no two flakes 
can follow exactly the same path through the sky - that means that no 
two snowflakes are the exactly the same.
