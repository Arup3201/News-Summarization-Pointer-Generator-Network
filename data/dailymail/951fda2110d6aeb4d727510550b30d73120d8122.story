They wear the same shoes, the same tops and even the same underwear, and haven't been apart once in more than 20 years.

Meet Amy and Becky, 45, from Los Angeles who describe themselves as the 'twinniest twins ever' and admit that they're addicted to being identical.

But their obsession with staying the same has come at a price: neither has ever had a relationship, partly because of their insistence on doing everything from sleeping to dating as a pair.

Identical: Amy (left) and Becky (right) are obsessed with looking exactly the same as each other

'We're addicted to being identical,' chirps Amy. 'We have matching everything - we have matching jeans, matching pants, matching dresses, matching shoes... We even have matching underwear.

'Our fingernails are always painted the same,' chimes in Becky. 'We wear the exact same make-up always, exactly the same sort of pink-beige blush.

'It is nerve wracking at the salon because whatever you're doing to me, you have to do to her next.'

Amy adds: 'God forbid one of us should break a nail, or trip and fall... I did about a month ago and I had a scrape...

'I was almost tempted to do it myself so I had the exact same scrape,' confesses Becky. 'We've got to keep it all alike.'

The twins' obsession with looking exactly the same began 20 years ago when Amy gained weight and was left 6kg heavier than her sister.

Obsessive: The pair are so addicted to looking the same, they even eat exactly the same thing

Work: Along with living together and sleeping in the same room, the sisters also share a job

'For some reason, Amy had gained a teeny 
bit more weight than me and people were like "oh, you're the big twin 
and you're the small twin",' remembers Becky.

'Literally from then on out, we eat exactly 
the same bites of food and the same amount of drink to stay the same 
weight, no matter what.'

Their rule even applies to the drinks they choose when they go out and the pair carry a set of scales to measure food on the go.

'Whenever we have situations where we can't tell whether portions are even or not, we'll pull out the scales and weigh it,' explains Amy.

They also synchronise their workout sessions to ensure their fitness levels remain exactly the same.

'We have to work out the exact same amount,' says Becky. 'If I'm on the treadmill for 
20 minutes, she's on the treadmill for 20 minutes because she has to do 
the same.'

Worried: The twin's friend Jillian worries about what might happen should one twin leave the other

Dating: The pair are so addicted to being alike, they even go on each other's dates

Gisele Bundchen

She's not a model like her Victoria's Secret Angel sister, but Gisele Bundchen's twin, Patricia, is just as beautiful. The twins are part of a family of six girls, that also includes sisters Raquel, Graziela, Gabriela and Rafaela.

Kiefer Sutherland

The 45-year-old 24 star has a twin sister who arrived seven minutes after he did. Rachel also works in Hollywood but behind the camera as a production supervisor.

Siva Kaneswaran

Calm down ladies! Not only does The Wanted's Siva have a twin, brother Kumar is identical and as a result, just as handsome.

Joseph Fiennes

The British actor, 43, has a twin brother named Jacob, who unlike the rest of his thespian-heavy family, chose to become a conservationist instead.

Eva Green

Although the 33-year-old actress and her twin sister Joy share similar features, Joy is no fan of the limelight, instead choosing a quiet country life and a career as a horse breeder.

Although the twins say they're happy with their unorthodox lifestyle, their friend Jillian says she is concerned and worries about what might happen should they be forced apart.

'I know other twins but they take it really over the top - they have to do every single thing together,' she explains.

'One day, they might have to be apart for
 some reason. And I don't want them to be in the position where they 
can't function fully because they're apart.

'My main concern is that one would die before the other and the other would be lost, completely, without the other twin.'

In a bid to help the twins, who appear on TLC show My Strange Addiction, Jillian challenges the pair to spend 24 hours apart.

'It's driving me crazy right now because I
 feel as if half of my body has been cut off,' reveals Becky, who spends the challenge at home alone without her sister.

'I will never agree to do 
this again. I miss my sister so much - I'm literally counting the 
minutes until we're together again.'

She adds: Knowing I'm not going to be identical
 with my sister today is making me sick in my stomach.

'We're not used to
 it - we haven't been apart for 20 years. I hate being apart from my 
sister. I miss her like I miss half myself - I can't wait to see her.'

Reunited, the pair vow never to repeat the experiment. 'We were so excited to see each other,' they chime as one. 'I just don't want to be separated from her ever again.'
