The pavement of a busy London street suddenly 'exploded' into flames last night, shocking residents who had to be led to safety.

A 'huge' fireball burst through a manhole cover on Holloway Road, Islington, north London, after electrical wires became caught in the hole.

Police cordoned off the road while firefighters evacuated homes, helping five people to escape from the smoke.

A manhole cover 'exploded' on Holloway Road, Islington, north London, last night after electrical wires got caught in a manhole cover, which then burst into flames

One person was treated for smoke inhalation after the blast, which caused chaos as emergency services cordoned off the area 

One woman was treated for smoke inhalation after the blast which knocked out power in the area.

Witnesses spoke of their fear and confusion after smoke and flames started rising from the road at around 10pm.

Jessica Farley said: 'Pavement just exploded outside my flat on Holloway road. Smoke everywhere and a complete power cut. Loads of fire engines and road blocked.'

Kay Lockett tweeted: 'The pavement just exploded outside my flat. No power on Holloway Road. Sat in the dark.'

Another shocked witness, using the name @supreme-nelle on Twitter, said: 'Powercut on my road & some of holloway road because some electrically wires went on fire... The fire was huge! There's no electricity.'

Another Twitter user, @MCFCJon, said he saw the 'fire brigade forcing their way into properties'. 

The fire happened just outside the Green Jade Chinese restaurant. 

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'We were called to a fire in a manhole cover in the pavement, at 22:01 in Holloway Road, Islington.

'Electrical supply was cut off. Five persons were led to safety by the brigade and one one adult female suffered from smoke inhalation and was treated on the scene by London Ambulance Service (LAS).

'All persons were accounted for. Police, LAS, and electrical engineers attended.'

The resulting power cut left more 115 houses out of power, with that number increasing to more than 200 as engineers tried to fix the problem.

The latest exploding manhole cover comes just months after 50 homes, also in Islington, had to be evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area.

The explosion happened outside Green Jade Chinese restaurant at around 10pm yesterday

Lucky: Miraculously nobody was killed when a pavement explosion in Piccadilly, central London, set fire to a lorry in July

A shop front in Pimlico, central London, was engulfed in flames after an explosion shattered the pavement

Then, in July, a lorry was engulfed in flames by a manhole explosion in Piccadilly, while only last month, flames erupted from a manhole cover by commuters on Old Brompton Road, South Kensington.

Colin Wingate was severely injured and confined to a wheelchair for three months after a manhole cover exploded in Harrow, north-west London, in August 2011.

He said: 'There was a huge - and when I say huge I mean enormous - explosion. Huge to the point that the iron manhole cover left the ground, I left the ground - and it was Bedlam.'

He added: 'They are not doing enough to ensure that these accidents, incidents, call them what you like, don't happen anymore. Because sooner or later, at the rate these explosions are continuing, someone is going to lose their life.' 

Figures to September show that, so far this year, there have been 124 serious manhole fires involving faulty electric cables and junction boxes in Britain, compared to 34 in 2010.

The overwhelming majority - 113 - have occurred in the South East of England, but serious incidents have been recorded over the past few years in Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and, just last month, Aberdeen.

More than 100 serious manhole cover fires were reported this year. These pictures show a manhole fire in Peterborough in 2011

Blast: A fire engine was called out after an explosion tore though the pavement in Islington, north London

The culprit appears to be the age of the country’s network of underground electricity distribution cables, combined with - or so the half-dozen electricity distribution companies claim - the vagaries of the British weather.

Two very wet winters, it seems, have resulted in water seeping into link (junction) boxes, with delayed but serious consequences. 

Earlier this year, the Health and Safety Executive warned UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes electricity to London and the South East, to improve its safety record.

Exploding pavements may be a nationwide problem but the risk is greatest by far in London. Sixty-four of the 113 serious incidents in the UKPN area so far this year have occurred in the capital, an average of almost two a week.

A UKPN spokesman said: 'At 10.37pm last night, UKPN was alerted about an incident on some of our equipment in Holloway Road, London. The incident initially interrupted electricity supplies to 115 customers in the area. 

'Our engineers attended to help the emergency services in making the area safe and carry out work to reconnect power supplies as quickly as possible. 

'They had to isolate supplies to some further customers before reconnecting power in stages by 4.40am. The cause of the incident is being investigated. The safety of the public and our staff is UKPN’s top priority.'
