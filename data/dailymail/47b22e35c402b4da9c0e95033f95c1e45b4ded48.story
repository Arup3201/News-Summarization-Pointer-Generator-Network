Rebekah Brooks, the former News International executive at the centre of the phone hacking scandal, has become a mother after a surrogate gave birth to a baby girl.

The 43-year-old, who could still face criminal charges over the affair, released a picture of herself holding her new daughter.

Scarlett Anne Mary was born yesterday afternoon at The Portland private hospital in London. She weighed 6lb1oz.

Brooks, who was editor of The News Of The World when reporters allegedly hacked murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone, announced the news through PR company Bell Pottigner.

She and her husband, former racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, have been trying for a baby for five years.

They had unsuccessful infertility treatment and eventually decided to use a surrogate.

In a statement, they said: ‘Our 
beautiful little miracle, Scarlett Anne Mary Brooks arrived at The 
Portland at 4.05pm weighing 6lb1oz.’

It is understood that the surrogate 
mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, had been expecting twins but the
other baby died at an early stage of the pregnancy

The Brooks’ spokesman David Wilson said: ‘They are obviously overjoyed and relieved at a safe birth.

‘Scarlett was born at 37 weeks and is perfectly healthy and the family are getting to know one another.

'It is tremendous news for them. They have been trying for five years to have a baby – since they got together.

‘They had more than two years of 
treatment to see if they could, but that has not been possible. They 
will be forever indebted to the surrogate.'

Brooks, who grew up in Warrington, 
Cheshire, edited the News of the World and the Sun before becoming chief
executive of parent company News International in 2009.

Public furore erupted in July after 
it was reported that a private detective working for the News of the 
World, when Brooks was the editor, had hacked the mobile phone of 
murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

The News International boss quit her 
post on July 15. Two days later Scotland Yard detectives arrested her on
suspicion of phone hacking and corruption.

She is currently on police bail. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence.

Brooks’s personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 47, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

She had worked for the ex-News International boss for 19 years at both The Sun and then the News Of The World

In a statement given at the time of 
her resignation Brooks said: 'As chief executive of the company, I feel a
deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to 
reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place.

'I have believed that the right and responsible action has been to lead us through the heat of the crisis.'

The fallout from the phone hacking affair led to David Cameron setting up the Leveson Inquiry into media standards.

Since it began in November, a string of celebrities have given evidence claiming they have been victims of phone hacking.

Editors, journalists and police officers have also gone before the inquiry.

Lord Leveson has said he is unlikely to recommend a law to curb press freedoms.

Yesterday the News of the World's 
most celebrated reporter Mazher Mahmood told the inquiry how he resigned
from a job at the Sunday Times after he was caught trying to pin the 
blame for a mistake in one of his stories on someone else by doctoring a
computer file.

Mahmood who was dubbed the 'fake 
sheik' for his tactic of dressing up as a rich Arab in order to trick 
the rich and famous into wrongdoing, blamed his dishonesty on being 
'young and naive'.
