Digging is expected to start soon in an attempt to solve the mystery of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance.

Search teams will scour sites across Praia da Luz, the Portuguese resort from which she vanished seven years ago at the age of four.

Her parents Kate and Gerry, who have never given up hope that she could be alive, have been briefed by Scotland Yard on the planned operation.

Resort: British police are said to be planning to dig three sites near the Ocean Club holiday apartments in the resort of Praia da Luz in Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann, then three, went missing in May 2007

Detectives say the searches are the 
logical next step in their multi-million pound inquiry and may coincide 
with arrests. They are waiting for permission from the Portuguese 
authorities before going ahead.

Forensic officers will use ground-penetrating radar to examine sites where earth has been disturbed over the past decade.

They will then move in with mechanical diggers and other earth-moving equipment. Finger-tip searches will also be used.

A source close the McCanns said it will be a ‘heart-breaking and hugely emotional time’ for the family.

‘Police have assured Kate and Gerry that it does not mean they are specifically searching for her body,’ he said.

Detectives are also said to be preparing to dig up a site on a beach near the Ocean Club apartments

‘They
 are doing searches as much as to rule scenarios out as much as rule 
them in. They will be concentrating on several different places at 
different phases.

‘Certain 
areas should have been searched properly way back by the Portuguese 
authorities but were not.’ The searches are not being conducted as the 
result of any new information. They are a sensitive issue for the 
Portuguese because any digging would suggest local police have done too 
little.

It is understood 
that the McCanns will not travel to Portugal but will be kept abreast of
 any developments at home. The high-profile dig is the latest stage of 
the Met’s sweeping cold case review of a notorious abduction.

A team of detectives have been undertaking a painstaking search through every document collected during the huge inquiry.

They
 have also made a series of appeals on the BBC’s Crimewatch which has 
led to new information coming to light. Police are expected to dig up 
two areas of land near the Ocean Club’s apartment 5a, where Madeleine 
vanished on May 3, 2007. They will also examine the beach.

Fresh
 aerial photographs are likely to be taken of the sites to assess the 
geography and geology. Officers on foot will examine the most likely 
locations, looking for any changes in vegetation, disturbances among 
rocks, unusual depressions or excess soil.

Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed

Hi-tech
 tools can detect changes in magnetic fields in the ground caused by 
disturbed earth and changes to resistance in wet soil caused by a body.

Ground
 penetrating radar and similar equipment was used during a search at the
 Haut de la Garenne former children’s home in Jersey several years ago.

On
 that occasion, police also employed specialist sniffer dogs and 
archaeologists, as well as pathologists to look for bodies. Last month, 
police announced they were about to begin ‘operational activity’ on the 
ground in Portugal, raising hopes that arrests could be imminent.

Any formal interviews will be conducted by Portuguese police with Met officers sitting in.

Officers
 are trying to identify a serial sex attacker who may have struck at 
least 18 times in Algarve resorts from 2004 to 2010.

Several British girls, including one as young as ten, were assaulted as they slept in their beds.

Last
 Saturday was the anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance and prayers 
were said for her at her village church in Rothley, Leicestershire

Mr
 McCann, 45, said then: ‘The Met are going back out to Portugal very 
soon. They are chipping away and there is new evidence. We are going to 
continue hoping we get a happy outcome.’
