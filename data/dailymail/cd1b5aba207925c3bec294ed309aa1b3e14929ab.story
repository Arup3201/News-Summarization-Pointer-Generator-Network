A professional fisherman is presumed dead after his boat was found abandoned with the motor still running three days ago off the coast of northern NSW.

The search for Lismore resident Mick Endres began on Saturday morning after the fisherman failed to return to port about 30 hours after his last radio contact, but the search was called off on Tuesday morning after police gave up hope of any chance of survival.

His 7m aluminium runabout, Julie, was found still running by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter off Evans head shortly after 10am on Saturday but there was no sign of Mr Endres.

It is believed he fell overboard while fishing and attempted to climb back on board by using a steering cable as a handle

Coffs Harbour water police coordinator Don Stewart said the major search was suspended at 10am on Monday for the professional line and trap fisherman who is believed to have fallen overboard while on the fishing expedition.

‘The possibility of survival during this time is virtually non–existent,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘Every area that has needed to be covered had been covered on a number of occasions by surface craft and also by aircraft.’

The extensive search included three additional helicopters, one fixed wing aircraft and numerous coast guard vessels covering from Ballina heading south to North Solitary Island taking in 30 miles of sea.

A police spokeswoman said the search would continue by foot patrols along the beach but the major search would not continue unless new information came to light.

Sergeant Stewart said it was a possibility that Mr Endres was not wearing a life jacket at the time he disappeared out at sea. 

‘We can’t confirm whether he was wearing a life jacket but it is common practice that they don’t wear them while fishing,’ he said.

Pilot Tom Hulse and crewman Mark Sewell winched fellow crew Tom Burns onto the bobbing deck of the tinny and found the boat vacant, The Northern Star reported.

A rope was suspended over Julie's stern quarter anchoring the boat to the bottom, in more than 91 metres of water 16 nautical miles (29km) east of the Evans River bar.

It is believed a spanner crab trap was anchoring the boat in place which could have been when Mr Endres fell overboard.

A hydraulic steering cable attached to one of its two outboard motors was damaged suggesting Mr Endres may have tried to re-board the boat using it as a handle.
