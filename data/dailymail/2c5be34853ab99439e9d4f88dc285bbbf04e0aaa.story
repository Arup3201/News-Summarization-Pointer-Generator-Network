The mother of the Chinese student victim in the 'Canadian Psycho' murder and dismemberment case says her 'most unbearable pain' is that the killing is still watched online.

'What a disaster and huge pain for our family,' Zhigui Du said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, sobbing.

'The most unbearable pain for me is that the video got posted on the internet. People watched it over and over.

'It's like my son is being murdered again and again,' she said.'He was so passionate about life and so many beautiful things. Why did his life have to end? Why did he have to suffer so much? Why was that brutal video put on the internet?

'And it was so hard for our family. My loving boy killed in that way.'

'Cannibal killer' Luka Magnotta faces trial in Montreal after military transport him home from Germany

Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, last month pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and four other charges including committing indignities to a body.Magnotta, who worked as an occasional porn actor and an escort, is alleged to have used an ice pick to stab Lin Jun -- a Chinese student at Montreal's Concordia University -- sometime between May 24 and 25.

Chinese student Lin Jun, 33, was hacked to death with an ice pick in Montreal, Canada, in May

The suspect is thought to have then carved up the victim's body, sexually abused the corpse and filmed the act, before posting the video on the internet.

Magnotta is also suspected of eating parts of Lin Jun's body.

On May 29, police in Montreal discovered 33-year-old Lin's torso in a suitcase by the rubbish outside an apartment along a busy highway.The victim's severed hands and feet were then discovered to have been sent through the mail to government parties in Ottawa and to two schools in Vancouver. The head was later found in a Montreal park.Magnotta was arrested in Germany after a global manhunt, and returned to Canada on charges including murder and abusing a corpse.The 29-year-old was reading stories about himself online when he was caught in an internet cafe in Berlin.His original arrest warrant cited first-degree murder, committing an indignity to a dead body, publishing an obscene matter, mailing obscene matter and criminally harassing Canada's prime minister Stephen Harper and other members of the country's parliament.Du said she and her husband have been treated with 'kindness' by the Canadian government, and have been shown sympathy and support since they arrived in Montreal following their son's grisly slaying.But his brutal death has shattered the idealistic view of Canada that Lin had impressed on his mother, she added.

'We still believe that most people here are very kind, but this heinous crime happened in Canada. It's made me reconsider what kind of place this is,' she told the CBC.Now when she walks down the street in Montreal sometimes she feels like 'everyone looks like Magnotta. I live with so much fear.'

Asked whether he expected justice Jun Lin's father, Diran Lin, replied, 'I hope so... I can only wish for it.'

Zhigui Du told the CBC that she doesn't believe her son had been in a relationship with Magnotta, but said the truth would come out during the trial.

The murder victim's parents said they are now trying to decide whether to put their son's remains rest in Montreal, or to take them back to China.

'We Chinese have an old saying: "Fallen leaves must go back to the root of the tree",' she said.

According to TheStar.com a lawyer who heard Magnotta make allegations about being repeatedly abused and forced to have sex with animals says he might be called as a witness at his murder trial.

Romeo Salta, who said he met with Magnotta several times at his office in Manhattan, New York, in the winter of 2010-11, has claimed he was contacted by the 29-year-old's defence team.
