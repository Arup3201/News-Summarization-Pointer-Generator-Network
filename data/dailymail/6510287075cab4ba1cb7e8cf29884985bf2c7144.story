Life as the Australia captain continues to treat Steve Smith well as he shone on day one of the third Test with India in Melbourne.

Smith ended the opening day of the famous Boxing Day Test at the MCG unbeaten on 72 as the Baggy Green just about shaded honours on 259 for five.

Captain Smith made sure any advantage was a home one, digging in at the end to continue his fine form so far against the touring Indians.

Australia ended day one of the third Test in Melbourne on 259 for five against the touring Indians

He made 162 in the first Test in Adelaide and then, replacing the injured Michael Clarke in charge for the second, he scored 133 in Brisbane as Australia went 2-0 up in the series.

A third ton in a row looks a good bet here, with the experienced Brad Haddin alongside him on 23 at the close.

Their gritty stand of 43 was needed, with India rewarded for some good discipline with the ball prior to that.

Umesh Yadav made a breakthrough just 12 balls in, opening the face of David Warner's bat and removing him at third slip for a duck.

That threw Chris Rogers and Shane Watson together and the pair both made half-centuries in a stand of 115.

The former got to 57 before he edged Mohammed Shami to keeper MS Dhoni, while Watson - dropped on 37 by Shikhar Dhiwan - was trapped leg before trying to sweep R Ashwin on 52.

Shaun Marsh added 32 as part of a 69-run stand with Smith before he nicked Shami behind, while debutant Joe Burns was also pouched by MS Dhoni for 13 as he miscued a pull off Yadav and bottom-edged behind.

India had a real look in at 216 for five but Smith and Haddin saw Australia through to the end.
