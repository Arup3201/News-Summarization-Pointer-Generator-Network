The exodus of African and Asian players will accelerate this week with more than 30 expected to depart English clubs for major international tournaments.

The Asia Cup in Australia begins on January 9 and the Africa Cup of Nations starts in Equatorial Guinea eight days later, with both competitions providing a route to the Confederations Cup in Russia in the summer of 2017.

Manchester City are still involved in negotiations about precisely when Yaya Toure must be released. 

Yaya Toure will be a huge miss for Manchester City when he is released for international duty next month

Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing Seamus Coleman

Manuel Pellegrini claimed on Sunday that it was yet to be decided if the midfielder could play against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on Sunday.

Most African players are expected to leave before the weekend but clubs will be busily involved in similar talks.

Newcastle would have liked to keep Papiss Cisse, Mehdi Abeid and Cheick Tiote until after the tricky FA Cup third-round tie at Leicester, for whom Nigel Pearson would prefer to have wide midfielders Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez available.

It was among the reasons why the two Barclays Premier League teams agreed to play on Saturday when 16 top-flight clubs moved their third-round ties to offer players more recovery time after the fixtures on Thursday. 

Leicester’s flexibility was limited by the fact Leicester Tigers rugby team are at home to Bath on Sunday and police would not agree to both games on the same day.

The question of Cisse’s availability will become irrelevant as he faces a violent conduct charge for throwing an elbow at Seamus Coleman which is likely to result in a ban.

West Ham will be missing top scorer Diafra Sakho throughout January due to the Africa Cup of Nations 

As well as his brother Yaya, Kolo Toure is also set to represent Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations

All clubs are subject to FIFA’s 14-day rule but some nations can be more accommodating than others with their big-name stars.

There is no longer much bleating by club managers about losing players to a tournament which is clearly fixed in the international calendar, although the Africa Cup of Nations has been moved from Morocco, who pulled out after this year’s ebola crisis.

West Ham will be among those who feel the pinch. Sam Allardyce will lose top scorer Diafra Sakho and midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate after the game at home to West Bromwich Albion on Thursday.

They will not be available for the FA Cup tie at Everton next Tuesday, but Allardyce has been boosted by Cameroon’s decision to omit Alex Song from the squad.

West Ham’s Guy Demel has retired from international football so is not in the provisional Ghana squad named by manager Avram Grant. 

Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto’o and Steven Pienaar are also in international retirement. 

Nabil Bentaleb - in action for Tottenham against Leicester on Boxing Day - will join up with the Algeria squad

Mile Jedinak put in a sterling performance for Crystal Palace as they secured a hard-earned point at QPR

Palace winger Yannick Bolasie won't be joining up with the Congo squad until his wife has given birth

John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Victor Wanyama (Kenya) and Stephane Sessegnon (Benin) are also not involved because their countries did not qualify. Hull’s Mo Diame has been ruled out by a knee injury.

Tottenham, who play at Burnley in the FA Cup on Monday, will release Nabil Bentaleb after facing Chelsea on New Year’s Day and Swansea, who play League Two Tranmere on Saturday, will release Wilfried Bony after their game against QPR on Thursday.

Ki Sung-yueng will also be available for Garry Monk against QPR before he joins the South Korea squad in Australia for the Asia Cup.

Bolton’s Lee Chung-yong is also in the South Korea squad.

Australia refused Crystal Palace’s request to keep captain Mile Jedinak until after their Aston Villa game on New Year’s Day.

‘They’re not necessarily pleased but they accept it,’ said Jedinak. At least Palace won’t lose winger Yannick Bolasie - who has said he won’t join up with Congo until after his wife has given birth.
