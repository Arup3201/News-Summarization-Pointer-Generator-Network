Board brothers: Princes David Kahalepouli Kawanaankoa and Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole set a UK first when they went surfing in Bridlington, Yorkshire, of all places, in 1890

One's a tropical paradise in the Pacific with long, hot summers, crystal blue waters - and high-rolling waves.

The other is rather more chilly and somewhat lacking in the 'crystal blue' department.

But that didn't stop two 19th-century Hawaiian princes taking to the North Sea off the coast of Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in what is believed to be the first instance of surfing in Britain.

A long-lost letter, published for the first time, reveals the two young royals and their English guardian went surfing at the resort in September 1890.

The document, possibly the earliest report of the sport in Britain, was uncovered after research into Victorian surfers.

Pictures of the trio and details of their escapade - which stunned locals - have gone on display at Europe’s only dedicated surfing museum, in Braunton, North Devon.

Museum founder Peter Robinson has now called for a statue of the princes to thank them for bringing surfing to Britain.

He said: 'This is the most wonderful discovery and a massive revelation in terms of British surfing heritage.

'The fact that not only do we now know that Hawaiian royalty surfed while being educated in England in the late 1800s, but also that they chose a relatively obscure surfing destination like Bridlington on the east coast to paddle out and catch a few slides is just fantastic.

'This is the earliest proven instance of surfing in Britain so far - previously we had thought it was the 1920s in England and the Channel Islands - but this blows our history right out of the water.

'The Victorian locals must have been incredulous at the sight of these Hawaiian Princes paddling out, and riding back into shore most likely standing on large wooden planks - their dark skin and hair glistening in the North Sea waters.

'I only wish I could have been there to see it.'

The letter, to Hawaiian consul Henry Armstrong from Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Piikoi, was discovered by Hawaiian author and historian Sandra Kimberley Hall.

The prince wrote that he and his brother, Prince David Kahalepouli Kawanaankoa Piikoi, were allowed by their tutor - believed to be John Wrightson - to holiday in Bridlington.

The pair were given the reward for good work in their studies in schools at colleges around Britain.

They had been in England furthering their education for almost a year.

On September 22, 1890, a joyful Kuhio could not restrain his enthusiasm in his letter to Consul Armstrong.

He said: 'We enjoy the seaside very much and are out swimming every day.

'The weather has been very windy these few days and we like it very much for we like the sea to be rough so that we are able to have surf riding.

'We enjoy surf riding very much and surprise the people to see us riding on the surf.

'Even Wrightson is learning surf riding and will be able to ride as well as we can in a few days more. He likes this very much for it is a very good sport.'

The two Hawaiian royals were no strangers to surfing in chilly waters like the North Sea.

In 1885, they surfed in Santa Cruz on 15-foot redwood planks weighing 100lbs in similar temperature waters - making them the first to do it in California.

It is thought the Hawaiian princes, the orphaned nephews and heir to Queen Kapiolani, would have made their surfboards from timber acquired from a Bridlington boat builder.

They would have bought or hired neck-to-knee swimsuits made of cotton or wool.

The north east coast of England is home to some world class surfing waves - but Bridlington has never been a particularly popular beach for surfers.

The two princes were cousins of expert surfer Princess Victoria Ka’iulani, the half Hawaiian - half Scottish heir to the Hawaiian throne who was educated in the south coast resort of Brighton in 1892.

Sandra Kimberley Hall said: 'Her time in England was deliberately below the radar of the newspapers of the day.

'She may have been the first female surfer in Britain, but the only tangible evidence - so far - is a letter in which she wrote that she enjoyed ‘being on the water again’ at Brighton.

'She may have meant a walk on the West Pier, or a walk on the promenade. Ka’iulani liked swimming and surfing.

'She was a high-spirited girl, who when she returned to Hawaii, liked to sneak out past midnight to go swimming in the moonlight with girlfriends.'

The Museum of British Surfing recently published the only known photo of the young princess in a watersports setting - seated in an outrigger canoe at Waikiki.

By coincidence the latest Government-backed TV advert to encourage Britons to holiday at home features Harry Potter star Rupert Grint - surfing at Bridlington.

In Santa Cruz a statue descendants of the Hawaiian princes unveiled a plaque to commemorate their surfing ‘first’.

Peter Robinson added: 'We would love to commission a sculpture to honour their achievement and say thank you to Hawaii for giving the world the fantastic gift of surfing.'

The Museum of British Surfing opened in Braunton on April 6.
