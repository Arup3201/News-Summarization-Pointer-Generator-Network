Miracles do happen, and in the case of Gus Poyet, they can be made to look ridiculously easy.

Exactly a month ago, after a 5-1 drubbing at Tottenham, a disconsolate Poyet surveyed his ailing side’s prospects and declared it would take a miracle for them to preserve their Barclays Premier League status and avoid the drop.

Four wins on the spin, a sequence more akin to a team with designs on the title, and, suddenly, the fate Sunderland’s manager was resigned to has been averted with a game to spare.

If that was wondrous enough, the way they have done it — not least a vibrant performance at the Stadium of Light last night that was capped by a goal of rare quality from Fabio Borini — has been even more astounding.

Stunning victories at Chelsea and 
Manchester United, with an emphatic home win over Cardiff in between, 
and now West Brom put to the sword. The result all but confirmed 
Norwich’s demotion to the Championship, but they can have no complaints.

If they had a case 
for staying up, which is debatable, it certainly could not be at the 
expense of Poyet’s revitalised side. It could be at West Bromwich’s, but
 only if they somehow manage to wipe out goal difference arrears of 17. 
Now that would be a miracle.

There
 was a touch of symmetry, too, about West Brom being on the receiving 
end on the night Sunderland secured their Premier League future. They 
were Paolo Di Canio’s final opponents at the Hawthorns last September 
before the axe fell on his stormy reign.

A
 jubilant Poyet joined his players in the centre circle at the end to 
salute all sides of the ground, and the beaming smile was still in place
 later, as he said: ‘I believe in miracles now. I am absolutely 
delighted and so proud.

‘I 
was brought in here to do one job, and that was keep us in the Barclays 
Premier League. We have done that in a certain style, and it will be 
remembered for ever. It is historic. People will talk about the season 
Sunderland did it after being seven points adrift with six games left.

‘How
 did the miracle happen? By working and working and making sure the 
players clicked. I would like to know how many times a manager has 
played the same line-up five games running. That shows we have created 
something special. We feel ready to take on anyone now, such is the 
level of confidence in the team.

‘This
 is the biggest achievement of my life and the happiest I have ever 
been. I think of the fans and the city, the staff and the chairman, and I
 am just so pleased everyone can head home tonight knowing that they 
will have Premier League football to look forward to next season.’

Sunderland
 went in front in the 13th minute, when Marcos Alonso went foraging down
 the left and whipped in a low cross that Jack Colback’s outstretched 
boot sent spinning beyond Ben Foster’s despairing right hand.

Sunderland have picked up the same number of points (12) from their last four games as they did from their previous 13 games.

The
 cushion of a 2-0 lead came courtesy of a goal that was brilliantly 
worked and clinically executed. Borini played a ball inside to Sebastian
 Larsson and kept advancing towards the area, as his team-mate 
controlled it and weighed up his options.

Decision
 made, Larsson cleverly lifted the ball over West Brom’s static 
defenders and into the path of Borini, who by this time had reached the 
penalty spot and faultlessly finished off a sublime move with a 
first-time volley on the turn.

West
 Brom briefly rallied in the second half and almost reduced the arrears 
when Victor Anichebe narrowly failed to convert Craig Dawson’s cross as 
he slid in at the far post.

But
 there was no denying rejuvenated Sunderland, and they could even afford
 one of the misses of the season in the 66th minute, when substitute 
Jozy Altidore somehow fired wide of a gaping goal after being set up by 
Colback.

It scarcely 
mattered. The home crowd were ready to forgive anything, as they cheered
 every tackle and every clearance and marked the start of stoppage time 
by rising to their feet for a rousing rendition of The Great Escape, 
scarves waved above their heads.

It was that sort of night, but the mood among home fans was in stark contrast to the dark cloud that hung over Pepe Mel.

Asked
 if he felt let down by his players, the West Brom manager replied: 
‘Yes, I am truly disappointed, particularly for the people who came here
 to support us. We need to change the image of the team and do something
 to improve it.

‘My future?
 That is something the club must decide. It is up to them, not me. But I
 want to congratulate Sunderland. They showed a lot of belief, and you 
could tell why they have had such a good month.’
