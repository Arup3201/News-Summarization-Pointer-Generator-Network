Magnificent palatial gardens, tasteful pastel bunting, pom-pom crown-emblazoned party hats, regally decorated cake pops and a handful of angelic children crowding around a little boy dressed in red, white and blue.

What could these beautiful images show other than Prince George’s first birthday bash? In reality, the only missing element from this perfectly elegant affair is the prince himself.

The star of the show in these images is Oscar, a one-year-old model, and rather than Kensington Palace,  the elegant surroundings are Riverhill Himalayan Gardens in Sevenoaks.

'George's' guests have all been dressed in quintessentially British style for the imaged party

The classy party was organised by event stylist Katie Burnett who chanelled the Duchess of Cambridge's style to envisage what the party to celebrate Prince George's first birthday on July 22 could look like.

Katie, who owns party planning boutique Les Enfants has been the brains behind many children's parties for the Kensington set and knows exactly how it’s done.

‘The style is based on Kate's love of a simple, elegant style,’ explains Katie.

Katie took her inspiration from the recent Royal tour of Australia, which offered the perfect opportunity to understand Kate’s baby taste.

‘Judging by Kate’s choices for Prince George's outfits on the trip, her taste is very traditional,’ Katie says. ‘So that’s how we styled the shoot.

'We included lots of giant balloons, which are a very popular at the moment - as are the tassel garlands.’

Of course, the party food was not only elegant but perfectly on trend and included cake pops, macaroons and swizzle sticks.

'For children, cake pops are a neat way of eating cake, often given out at end of parties now instead of a wrapped piece of cake. They are totally delicious and just enough as little taster,’ Katie says.

The clever little bite-sized cakes on a stick, which came from across the pond, are also ever-so-slightly gooier than regular cakes and a little less messy.

‘Macaroons
 are obviously a big food trend too and this filters into children's 
parties,' Katie adds. 'For Prince George we embellished them with the 
little edible crowns. They are delicious and just melt in the mouth.

‘Marshmallow sticks and chocolate-covered Oreos are also big at the moment.’Katie also made sure George's little guests looked the part.

‘We wanted 
the clothing for this special royal event to be quintessentially British
 so we selected brands that make timeless clothing to suit the regal 
birthday theme,’ she says.

‘The girls'
 dresses are simple yet extremely elegant in beautiful pastel shades and
 the boys are dressed in very traditional and classic lines.

'And one of his guests is fashioning a gorgeous romper with a crown motif by the same brand.’

And if you’re planning your own birthday bash? ‘My biggest tip would be to create a theme and colour scheme that incorporates your child’s likes and interests and add a touch of home-made for a unique birthday party style,’ Kate says.

‘You could choose a fill-in invitation, a designed one or maybe make your own using your little one’s hand or foot prints, which adds a lovely personal touch.

‘Depending on the scale of your party choose your venue with care, it is important to have a dedicated and safe area for the birthday child and their young friends, even if you have older children attending.'

'An intimate family party at home can often a good choice for first birthday parties,' Katie says.

Often at first birthday parties with extended friends and family there are a range of children of different ages.

‘This can make choosing the entertainment tricky,’ she says. ‘But you will find your local baby and toddler classes will offer party options to entertain babies, toddlers, younger guests and parents too!'

Soft play is also a way to create a safe space for the birthday boy or girl and you could even bring along toys and ride-ons to create a fun area,’ she says.
