EuroMillions winner Angela Dawes used to live in this £85-per-week two-bedroom static caravan with her ex-husband, it emerged today.

The 43-year-old - who won £101million with her new fiance Dave Dawes - now plans to leave her old life behind and buy a luxury property in Chelsea with her winnings.

Home for the EuroMillions winner used to be this 32ft Sherwood static caravan in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, which she shared with her former husband John Leeman, The Sun revealed.

Rags to riches: The caravan where Angela Dawes lived with her ex-husband and son before scooping the EuroMillions jackpot

Ms Dawes, a mother-of-one, 'traded up' for a £70-per-week one bedroom apartment with her new partner Dave just a few miles away.

The multi-millionaire one-time former taxi driver kicked her husband John, 44, and their son Steven, 17, out of the mobile home as her marriage collapsed. She eventually moved out around four years ago.

A source at the caravan park told The Sun: 'I 
remember Angela when she used to live here. I think her and her husband 
split up and it was a bit messy.'

Her estranged son Steven has claimed that his mother sneaked a string of lovers into her home while his father was out at work.

He alleges she waited for John Leeman to go out on night shifts before inviting the men round behind his back.

And he says he was
 ordered to stay in his room while late night visitors spent hours in the 
family home before leaving in the early hours.

Sweet and sour: Dave and Angie Dawes' celebrations were marred by allegations that she had thrown her husband and son out of the family home after a string of affairs

One, he claimed, was Dave Dawes, now his mother’s partner of four years with whom she shared last Friday’s £101million jackpot.

‘When Dad was away working I would be sent to bed as early as 8pm and told to stay in my room,’ said Steven, who was 12 at the time.

‘I realised it was because she had different men coming into the house and I would hear them in the bedroom or in the living room. A few times I came out to use the bathroom or to get a drink late at night and saw a man in the house.

‘She would ask me what I was doing and tell me to get back to bed.

‘Sometimes she even told me to put the volume up on my TV so I couldn’t hear what they were doing.’ 

Steven said he saw Mr Dawes in the family home three times late at night. Another visitor was a man his mother knew from her work at the time.

The teenager, who lives with his father in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, previously complained that his mother, now 43, abandoned him after leaving to be with new love Mr Dawes, 47.

Bitter: Steven Leeman and his father John claim that lottery winner Miss Dawes kicked them out in 2006

The bitter allegations emerged within hours of the couple going public about their lottery win, the third biggest in Britain.

Mr Leeman, a lorry driver, said he was thrown out of the family home when he confronted his wife about her alleged affairs. He claimed he came home one night to find his clothes dumped outside in bags.

His son added he was told ‘if I didn’t like it I should go’ when he came back from a school trip to France to find his father gone.

Since then, father and son claim, Miss Dawes – who plans to marry her partner next year but has already changed her surname by deed poll – has ignored her son.

Former soldier Mr Leeman said: ‘I knew something was up as she would wear matching lingerie and dress herself with make-up when she was going out. This went on for about eight or nine months before I was thrown out.

‘Then neighbours started saying they saw different men rushing into the house late at night after hiding in the back seat of her car or even in the boot.

‘It’s not right as a mother to be carrying on like that when your 12-year-old son is sleeping in the next room. It’s unbelievable.’

The couple and their young son lived in a rundown caravan in a trailer-park on the outskirts of Wisbech for ten years until 2006.

They then moved into a modest rented house and it was then, Steven claims, the after-dark visits from men began.

Towards the end of the year the couple’s relationship broke down when Mr Leeman confronted her about the visitors and he was thrown out of the two-bedroom house.

The 44-year-old said his ex-wife also
 left him £20,000 in debt after she splashed out on designer goods, 
nights out and furniture for her ‘love nest’ with Mr Dawes, a shift 
supervisor.

‘It has not been easy raising a son 
alone and with all those debts,’ he said. Steven, who has said he is not
 interested in his mother’s fortune, added: ‘When she made me leave she 
gave me some numbers and an address so I could contact her but they were
 all false.

‘I was very young and had no way of 
contacting my mum. I couldn’t understand it. Since then I haven’t heard 
anything. No Christmas cards or birthday cards. Nothing.’

Charity shop volunteer Miss Dawes declined to comment last night when contacted through Camelot.

A Camelot spokesman reissued a 
statement she released after the first allegations emerged, which said: 
‘I’m saddened by these reports.

'A lot of what has been said since my
 divorce has been untrue and very hurtful. I’ve always wanted to be in 
contact with my son, who I love dearly, and very much still want to 
rebuild our relationship.’

On Tuesday, Miss Dawes and her 
partner – who live in a £70-a-week one-bedroom flat in Wisbech – said 
they had drawn up a list of 15 to 20 friends ‘that we’re going to sort 
of make millionaires’.

It emerged yesterday that former Premier Foods shift supervisor Dave Dawes was adopted as a child and he is set to make his
 foster parents and natural father millionaires as well.

He only found his birth father two years ago.
