She said she put the winning lotto ticket in a place no one else would find it.

And that appears to go for herself too, as McDonald's worker Mirlande Wilson has now revealed she cannot find the ticket with the winning numbers on it which could snag her a $105million prize.

The Maryland mother-of-seven said she has lost the ticket but isn't very worried about finding it any time soon.

She told the New York Post: 'I have no idea where it is. I’m not sure I have it. I’m still looking for it. I haven’t 
even looked in my uniform pants yet.

Lost it: Now Mirlande Wilson is saying she cannot find the winning ticket but hasn't really looked for it properly and thinks God will help to find it if it's meant to be

'Winner': Mirlande Wilson, right, and her attorney Edward Smith Jr arrive at a news conference on Wednesday where he said he could not confirm if she did indeed have the winning ticket

'I’m still looking everywhere to find it, in my purse, 
everywhere.'

The 37-year-old told the paper 
earlier this week that she hid the ticket at the McDonald's restaurant 
she worked at, even though she is claiming she bought the ticket with 
her own money and not through the work pool, much to the chagrin of her 
coworkers.

Her daughter Stephanie also revealed that her mother would not even allow them to look for the ticket.

'I wanted to look for it, I was crying. She wouldn’t let us. It’s a lot of money,', the 15-year-old said.

Since the Mega Millions draw last 
Friday, the Haitian immigrant has dominated the headlines as she came 
forward to say she had one of the three winning tickets.

But she refused to share the jackpot 
with her McDonald's coworkers and said she bought the winning ticket 
with a lucky dollar she found on the ground.

She then went on to say it was in a 
safe place at an undisclosed location before saying it was at the fast 
food restaurant she worked in at Milford Mill. Now she claims she lost 
it.

She is leaving the discovery of the 
ticket in the hands of God: 'It’s a blessing from God. If it’s meant to 
be, we’ll [find and] claim the ticket.'

But the mother-of-seven's coworkers aren't so sure she's telling the truth.

Another colleague told the Post: 'I don’t believe her. I didn’t believe her from the beginning, she’s 
always been strange.

'She’s an attention seeker. She 
likes to have all the attention on herself.'

On her Facebook page, Ms Wilson has pledged to donate all of the winnings to rebuild her earthquake-ravaged native Haiti.

She wrote: 'All my true friend know im not greedy a person [sic] i don't want da money it made my life a living hell already im gonna give it all to rebuild haiti yall [sic] can chase all want my life and, my children it more important for money [sic].'

Ms Wilson held her own news conference last night where a lawyer pleaded that his client 'be allowed to return to a normal life', according to Wsbt.com.

Lawyer Edward Smith Jr asked the media to leave his client alone. Ms Wilson said little, only confirming that she is originally from Haiti.

The attorney said the attention had caused his client's blood pressure to spike. He said he was hired to protect her in case she was sued.

Proof? Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was

Ms Wilson told NBC she gave all of her coworkers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them.

Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them.

'McDonald's don't have nothing to do 
with this,' she insisted. 'They don't have nothing to do with - they 
don't even know about it and they don't even have nothing to do with 
this. It's only us by ourself [sic].'

Lottery executives said they cannot confirm who the lucky three ticket holders are in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois until they come forward.

Lucky winner? Mirlande Wilson, who says she bought the winning ticker with her own money rather than the pooled money with coworkers at McDonald's

Ms Wilson has yet to produce a ticket, leaving Mega Millions officials skeptical.

Stephen Martino, Maryland lottery 
director, told ABC: 'We don't know any more than the public or media 
does and it's all speculation and we're not going to get involved in 
that.'

Another official added: 'It's probably not this person.'

Winners in Maryland and Illinois have six months to claim the money - Kansas's newest multimillionaire has up to a year.

Both Maryland and Kansas will allow winners to remain anonymous but the lucky ticket-holder in Illinois will be identified.
