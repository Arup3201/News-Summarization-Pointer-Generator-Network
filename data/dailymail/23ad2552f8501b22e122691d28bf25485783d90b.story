Nico Rosberg lit up the world title contest by putting himself on pole for the American Grand Prix, a race beset by what seems to be a fanciful threat of a boycott.

The Circuit of the Americas was meant to suit championship leader Lewis Hamilton, but his Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was nearly four-tenths faster, giving the German hope of closing his 17-point deficit.

It was Rosberg’s ninth pole of the season — against Hamilton’s seventh — yet the Brit has shown again and again this season how he can rise beyond his starting position with bravura race drives.

‘Great day,’ said Rosberg. ‘It was quite a challenge because the wind was changing. The weather was changing. The start will be important.’

Sitting next to him on the stage as he will on the grid was Hamilton, who had been fastest for most of the weekend. ‘I struggled with brake balance,’ he said. ‘It is potentially a problem in the race.’

The on-track action was a merciful relief amid a febrile paddock in which Force India, Lotus and Sauber postured about staging a boycott in protest at how little, as they see it, of the sport’s revenues they get. But can we take them seriously?

It is doubtful in the extreme that they would defy Bernie Ecclestone in front of a TV audience of 350 million and a crowd of 100,000 in the most important marketplace in the sport. Ecclestone said: ‘Forget all that crap. I promise you they will be racing.’

Formula One has found it hard to crack America, especially after the 2005 boycott at Indianapolis over safety concerns left a lingering resentment among the public towards what they see as a distinctly European series.

It was put to Bob Fernley, of Force India, that not to race would be a further, perhaps fatal, blow to the sport in the States. He said: ‘That’s the last thing we want to do. There are three owners here who are passionate about racing, who have supported Formula One for many years in different formats. The last thing they want to do is damage it, but at the moment Formula One is damaging them big time.’

Part of their reasoning is valid: they deserve an equitable basic share of the sport’s revenue. Even Ecclestone admitted: ‘The problem is that there is too much money being distributed badly. That’s probably my fault. Frankly, I know what’s wrong but don’t know how to fix it.’

But the rebels would do well to remember that Formula One is about survival of the fittest; it is not the welfare state. There is something strange about millionaires, in some cases alleged billionaires, acting like beardy beggars. As with everyone else, they should operate within their means rather than spend money they have not got. That is one lesson to be taken from Marussia and Caterham, the two teams who went into administration between the last race in Russia and this one, whose plight is the catalyst for rebellion.

Fernley added: ‘The silence is deafening from people reaching out to help. It would be good for dialogue to start, for somebody to actually talk to us. We went through all the cost-control system with the FIA, but at the end of the day they couldn’t deliver it because they were out-voted by the Strategy Group [comprising McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus], and they know that. It is CVC [the equity firm that owns the sport] and the Strategy Group who are going to have to resolve it.’

Romain Grosjean of Lotus was the slowest of the 16 drivers, sitting out the action once the first session was over. Did he start the boycott early?

Sebastian Vetted withdrew after going through the motions for two laps. The world champion took a sixth engine of the season, condemning him to start from the back of the grid, so he merely needed to get out there to qualify and that’s all he did, keeping the miles down and his power unit fresh.
