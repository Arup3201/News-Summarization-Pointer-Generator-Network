The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 shocked the world and became a watershed moments in American history.

But few people know that his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, narrowly avoided being shot to death just hours after his impromptu inauguration aboard Air Force One.

On the night of November 22, 1963, the newly minted 36th president of the United States was in his home in Washington DC, where Secret Service agent Gerald Blaine was assigned to his security detail.

Mistaken identity: Just hours after Johnson's swearing-in ceremony aboard Air Force One (pictured), the president was in DC when agent Gerald Blaine mistook him for an intruder and pointed a sub-machine gun at his chest

In the confusion that followed President Kennedy's killing and Johnson's haphazard swearing-in ceremony, everyone forgot to tell the president about a new security protocol that had been put in place.

When Agent Blaine heard footsteps approaching in Johnson's home from the wrong direction, he grabbed a Thompson sub-machine gun and placed his finger on the trigger. 

A moment later, the agent found himself pointing his loaded gun directly at the chest of the new commander-in-chief. Blaine later recalled that a split-second later he would have shot Johnson.

Johnson's little-known near-death experience at the hands of a Secret Service agent is detailed in the new non-fiction book Hunting the President: Threats, Plots, and Assassination Attempts — from FDR to Obama' by historian Mel Ayton, which was reviewed by the New York Post.

Soft targets: Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton all have been targeted by would-be assassins

American presidents are among the most closely guarded people in the world, surrounded at all times by well-trained men and women of the U.S. Secret Service, but as Ayton's book shows, that does not stop people from making attempts on their lives.

Wanted man: President Reagan was stalked by a man who called himself 'catman,' and who sent letters with photos of cats

Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all been targets of elaborate, and at times outlandish and plain crazy, assassination plots.

In 2005, President Bush was delivering a speech in the country of Georgia when a man named Vladimir Arutyunian, 28, hurled a live Soviet-era hand grenade at the stage.

The explosive struck a girl in the crowd, but because it had been wrapped in a red piece of cloth, the firing pin failed to come out, preventing a blast. The FBI later stated that had the grenade went off, it could have killed the president.

Last year, two men, Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, and Eric J. Feight, 54, were charged with conspiracy to support terrorism for building a portable X-ray machine, which they allegedly planned to use to poison Muslims and President Obama with a lethal dose of radiation. 

The harebrained plot was ultimately foiled thanks to undercover federal agents who provided the would-be assassins with faulty parts for their 'death ray' after learning of their scheme.

During his two terms in office, President Reagan became the target of multiple assassination attempts, most famously in 1981, when John Hinckley shot him in a desperate bid to impress actress Jody Foster.

But few people know that the Gipper was also stalked by a man who called himself 'Catman,' and who sent threatening letters supplemented with close-up photos of his targets - and pictures of cats

When he was finally arrested in 1983, the Secret Service discovered photos of the suspect outside Gracie Mansion during Reagan’s visit to New York City.

Ayton writes: 'Catman had been close enough to shoot President Reagan, but his shot had apparently been blocked by agents.' 

In 1978, a man named Anthony Henry, 35, attempted to confront Reagan’s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, at the White House to take him task over the placement of the phrase 'In God We Trust' on banknotes, which he deemed blasphemous.

As part of his plan, Henry put on a karate gi and scaled the fence surrounding the president's residence on Pennsylvania Avenue. But the shoeless martial arts enthusiast was surrounded by police officers before he had a chance to approach the first family's living quarters.

After a tense 15-minte standoff, during which Henry slashed two officers with a knife, he was finally taken into custody.

More than a decade later, the White House became the setting of another attempt on the president's life, this time targeting Bill Clinton.

October 29, 1994, Army veteran Francisco Martin Duran walked to the presidential residence wearing a trench coat and armed to the teeth.

When he spotted a man resembling Mr Clinton, he opened fire. Of the 29 rounds shot by Duran, five struck the White House's wall and three broke a window. After police arrested the suspect, they found an atlas with the words 'Kill the Pres' scrawled on the cover.

Unfortunately, not all assassination plots were thwarted without bloodshed.

In 1950, two White House police officers were shot while protecting Harry Truman from a pair of Puerto Rican nationalists who launched an attack on Blair House across the street from the White House, which was undergoing a renovation at the time

Truman escaped injury, but police officer Leslie Coffelt died from a gunshot wound to the head. Before succumbing to his fatal injury, the heroic White House cop was able to take out one of the assailants.

On February 15, 1933, Giuseppe Zangara, a bricklayer from New Jersey, fired shots at President-elect Franklin Roosevelt during an event in Miami. The bullets missed the future architect of the New Deal by two feet, but struck Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who later died from his wounds, reportedly telling FDR, 'I'm glad it was me and not you.'

Zangara, who was ultimately sentenced to death, confessed to the crime, declaring: 'I have the gun in my hand. I kill kings and presidents first and next all capitalists.'
