Apple has admitted its computers were attacked by the same hackers who targeted Facebook.

The iPhone maker says no data has been stolen in an unprecedented admission of a widespread cyber-security breach.

Facebook revealed on Friday that unidentified hackers traced to China had staged a sophisticated attack by infiltrating its employees' laptops, but no user information was compromised.

Apple CEO Tim Cook at the firm's latest launch: Today it admitted hackers had targeted computers at the firm, but failed to steal information

Apple, which is working with law enforcement to track down the hackers, said that only a small number of its employees' Macintosh computers were breached, but 'there was no evidence that any data left Apple.'

In a statement, the Cupertino, California-based firm said: 'Apple has identified malware which infected a limited number of Mac systems through a vulnerability in the Java plug-in for browsers.

'The malware was employed in an attack against Apple and other companies, and was spread through a website for software developers.

'We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network.

'There is no evidence that any data left Apple.

'We are working closely with law enforcement to find the source of the malware."

The iPhone and iPad maker also said it would release a software tool later on Tuesday to protect customers against the malicious software used in the attacks.

Facebook also recently suffered a similar attack, and it is believed the same group could be behind both

Cyber-security attacks have been on 
the rise.

In last week's State of the Union address, U.S. President 
Barack Obama issued an executive order seeking better protection of the 
country's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks.

A report Monday by The New York Times claimed that an 'overwhelming percentage' of the cyberattacks on U.S. corporations, government agencies, and organizations all came from an office building in Shanghai with ties to the People's Liberation Army, information that remains unconfirmed and flatly denied by Chinese authorities.

It comes just days after the same group attacked Facebook.

‘Our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack,’ the social network said on February 15.

The
 company says the infiltration occurred when ‘a handful of employees’ 
visited a website that, in turn, infected their laptops with security 
compromising malware.

This, the statement says, despite the laptops being ‘fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software.’

According
 to the statement, the compromised site installed software that bypassed
 internal security through a so-called ‘zero-day,’ or previously unseen,
 vulnerability and exploit the company’s built-in protections.

As reported by the New York Times on Friday, the security hole was a ‘well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle’s Java software.’

Facebook says they immediately quarantined the affected laptops and alerted authorities.

‘We have no evidence,’ the company stated on a blog post announcing the incident, ‘that Facebook user data was compromised in this attack.’

Weeks before the announcement, on February 1, Facebook was provided a patch for the software from Oracle, the makers of Java.

That same day, Twitter announced its security had been breached and 250,000 of its users’ data potentially accessed.

Twitter then suggested that other companies had fallen victim to similar attacks.

In late January, both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal also announced their systems had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers in apparent attempts to monitor the outlets’ coverage of the country.
