Fingers belonging to a child have been found in a rubbish bin on a Hawaiian housing estate.

The shock discovery was made by a passer-by at the Kukui Gardens Housing Complex in the Liliha suburb of Honolulu on February 12.

Forensic tests have confirmed that the fingers, which were inside a plastic bag, belonged to a child.

Police are unable to confirm how many digits were found or how long they had been in the rubbish.

However, Sgt Kim Buffet said they were from a child aged ten years old or younger.

She said: 'I have not seen anything in my 25 years [on the force] like this.'

The woman who discovered the fingers is not a suspect in the case.

But after interviewing local residents and cross-checking missing person reports, detectives admit that they have hit a wall.

Sgt Buffett said: 'We're really heavily relying on the public out there to come forward. Somebody has to know something.

'I mean, it's not normal to find fingers in a dumpster.'

A reward of up to $1,000 is available for information that leads to the arrest of a suspect.

Meanwhile, Kukui Gardens residents say they are disturbed by the discovery.

Monimer Serna called it 'scary', while neighbour Noelani Dilyard said hearing about the found fingers gave her 'chicken skin'.

She added: 'It's creepy. It really is.'
