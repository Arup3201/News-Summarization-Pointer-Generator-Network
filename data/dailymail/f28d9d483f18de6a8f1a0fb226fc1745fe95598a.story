A bottle of 'Miraval, Cote de Provence' rose wine, 6,000 bottles of this rose wine, produced from grapes grown in the vineyard in southern France owned by U.S. actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, are now on sale

The first batch of wine from soon-to-be-wed Hollywood golden couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie has been released.

Miraval, a rose produced from the couple's £35million estate near the town of Brignoles in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, will be priced at around £13 a bottle. The estate includes around 50 to 60 acres of vines.

One of the reasons wine-buff Brad bought 17th-century Chateau Miraval is because it is a working vineyard of 50 to 60 acres of vines that produces a white wine called Lady Jane, a red called Natouchka, and its award-winning rose, Pink Floyd.

The latter got its name after the rock group recorded part of their album, The Wall, at the estate.

There is also a stonewalled cellar, that dates back to 1850, filled with white wines from the Coteaux Varois appellation and red, white and rose from the Cotes de Provence.

The wine's production has been overseen by the Perrins, a French winemaking family. Jolie and Pitt, however, want to do more than 'just put their name' on the bottle, according to Marc Perrin.

He said: 'They want to be proud of the wine on their property. They are really looking for excellence.

'We are two families at the service of the estate.'

Perrin told MSN he expected there to be around 150,000 bottles of the rose wine on the market in the first year, followed later by red and white wine.

The wines would be sold through 'good wine merchants and in good restaurants', he added.

According to Perrin, his family and 
the famous couple came together with this business venture over a few 
bottles of wine when the stars invited him over the the Chateau in June 
2012.

The A-listers bought the 17th-century estate for £35million. One of the reasons they chose it is because it has a working vineyard

The wine's production has been overseen by the Perrins, a French wine-making family who are friendly with the couple

'Brad and Angelina are very friendly, nice people and down to earth,' Perrin told Bloomberg.

The news came in the run-up to Brangelina's wedding which will take place at Chateau Miraval. The picturesque estate even has its own Romanesque chapel, where the couple plan to exchange vows.

And after a £10 million renovation project, personally overseen by Fight Club actor Pitt, a grand reception hall has was added , which will make the perfect location for the wedding party.

Afterwards, guests can wander the 
grounds that are filled with 20 beautiful water fountains, aqueducts and
a stream that runs through hidden tunnels and into a moat and ornamental lake.

Animal rights organisation PETA recently quashed rumours the couple were having eight elephants at the the ceremony.

The estate: The 1,200-acre property, Chateau Miraval, already grows enough grapes for 150,000 bottles of wine

The news came in the run-up to Brangelina's wedding which will take place at Chateau Miraval. The picturesque estate even has its own Romanesque chapel, where the couple plan to exchange vows.

However, under French law there will also have to be a civil ceremony officiated by the local mayor at the nearby town hall.

Michael Latz, the mayor of Correns, says: ‘They are a wonderful couple with beautiful children and we will hold a civic reception to honour them.’

Brangelina - as they became known - have a brood of six children; five-year-old Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne, aged three, along with three adopted children Maddox, 10, Pax, eight, and Zahara, seven. 

The couple are just the latest in a 
long list of stars who have invested in wine. Ex-Formula One champion 
Michael Schumacher, singer Sting and footballer David Beckham have all tried their hand recently.
