She was crowned Mrs Australia when she was 37 weeks pregnant and now Piper O'Neill is gearing up for Mrs International - just eight weeks after giving birth to her second child.

The former model turned full-time mother has completely embraced her post-baby body but shares how she struggled to accept her changing figure when she first became a mother.

The 31-year-old told Daily Mail Australia getting back into shape for the pageant has been more challenging compared to previous years, particularly because she has to juggle her time with her two young kids.

But Mrs Australia says she wouldn't have it any other way as her family always comes first and further hopes she can encourage other mothers to love their post-baby bodies too.

It was only eight weeks ago that Mrs O'Neill, who has been in the modelling industry since the age of three, gave birth to her baby boy Taylor.

She and her husband Jordan Green also have a 19-month-old daughter Elsie.

But Mrs O'Neill is determined more than ever to represent Australia and will be flying to Florida in the US to compete against more than 60 other women around the world.

'It's an honour to be representing the country and I'm really looking forward to it all,' she said. 

Mrs O'Neill, who was recently crowned Mrs Australia 2015 and is also an ambassador for charity program Look Good Feel Better, says she became involved in the competition as it wasn't solely based on looks.

'This pageant is really refreshing for me because it's open to all married women from all backgrounds, shapes and sizes,' she said.

'About 50 per cent of it is about raising awareness about your charity while the rest is about your evening gown and your health and fitness.'

Since giving birth to her second child, Mrs O'Neill's attitude has changed.

'It took me some time to finally accept my body during my pregnancy and afterwards too,' she said.

'I've been a model most of my life so not being in control of my body was really hard for me. My belly was growing and it felt like I was gaining five kilos just by looking at a piece of lettuce.

'Looking at myself in the mirror after my first child, with a fuller figure, was really difficult. 

'But when I was pregnant with Taylor, I went in with brighter eyes and knew what to expect from my body.

'I especially knew I had to have better and more positive views about my changing body in order to become a good role model for my daughter.'

And it is with that attitude she has decided to go into the Mrs International competition.

In between tending to her two children, Mrs O'Neill takes advantage of whatever free time she gets.

'I try to go the gym every night when my husband is home to look after the kids and do about 30 minutes of cardio,' she said.

'Of course, I actually don't end up doing this every day because as a mother something last minute always comes up.

'But I'm going to sign up to do a heavy training session with my personal trainer so I'll be committed to do that once a week.

'During nap-time for the kids, I try and squeeze in any other training.'

Mrs O'Neill is also very conscious of her diet, particularly because she is currently breastfeeding.

'I have to make sure I eat healthy for my baby so I can't just eat salads all the time for the sake of the competition,' she said.

'Plus this pageant doesn't have a swimwear section and instead focuses on health and fitness which is also why I wanted to get involved.'  

Mrs O'Neill says her main goal isn't about getting her pre-baby body back. 

'There's too much pressure on mums these days to go back to the way they were and I don't think that's a realistic goal,' she said.

'I've had two children and there is no hiding that. My focus now is being fit and healthy rather than skinny.

'So I'd really like to reach out to other mothers, encouraging them to go easy on themselves because it's an amazing thing that we can have children and bring them into this world.'

Mrs O'Neill says she's feeling pretty confident about the competition. 

 'It feels good to be part of something I'm familiar with again and hopefully I can bring home another crown for my daughter,' she said.
