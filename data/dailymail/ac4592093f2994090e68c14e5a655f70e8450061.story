Tormented relatives of Meredith Kercher yesterday said they feared their quest for justice may be thwarted by the American authorities.

Meredith’s elder brother Kyle insisted Amanda Knox must be punished for her part in the 2007 murder of his sister – yet was concerned she might never be sent back to Italy.

The 34-year-old warned that if the US did not extradite Knox, it could not expect other countries to return fugitives to face justice in America.

Stephanie Kercher and her brother Kyle: The siblings of murdered British student Meredith Kercher today called for her convicted murderer Amanda Knox to be returned to Italy to begin serving her 28-year sentence

Mr Kercher, who was in Florence for the ruling, said: ‘Ultimately somebody who is found guilty for murder, whoever they are, should  be punished.’

And Stephanie, Meredith’s sister, said it would be wrong for Knox or her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito to remain at liberty.

Mr Kercher said: ‘Nothing will ever take away the horror of what happened to her. The best we can hope for is of course finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion.’

The American, nicknamed Foxy Knoxy, has been sentenced to 28 years in prison for the murder of the Leeds University student, who was found half naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia.

Knox served four years but was freed on appeal in 2011 and immediately returned to the US.

Then this week, a court in Florence sensationally quashed that acquittal, reinstating the guilty verdict. Mr Kercher added: ‘It would set a difficult precedent if the US didn’t uphold their own laws.

'America obviously want a lot of people extradited. If America didn’t assist Italy they’re going to have problems going the other way.’

Knox has made repeated overtures to the Kercher family, writing in her multi-million pound memoir, Waiting to be Heard, that she hoped one day to meet them to assure them of her innocence.

As the verdict approached, she wrote a letter to her lawyer which is addressed to Miss Kercher’s family.

She told Good Morning America yesterday: ‘It’s in the mail. Mainly I just want them to know that I really understand that this is incredibly difficult, that they’ve also been on this never-ending thing and, when the case has been messed up so much, like, a verdict is no longer consolation for them.’

But the victim’s sister, Stephanie, said her family did not want to read the letter. And she ruled out a meeting, even if Knox were one day acquitted.

She said: ‘It’s not something that we would want to do at the moment and I can’t say that we ever will.

‘Regardless now of a guilty or not guilty verdict, a lot has happened so it would be difficult to try and meet someone having had all that happen.’

The Kerchers have been forced to accept that they may never know what happened to Meredith, she said.

She added: ‘I think we’re still on a journey to the truth. It may be we don’t ever really know what happened that night and that’s something we’ll have to come to terms with.

‘You can’t ever really get to a point where you just start to remember Meredith solely, because it is following the case, coming over to Italy and everything associated with it.

‘But the verdict has been upheld this time so we hope that... obviously, come the end of the trial, we are nearer the truth and an end so that we can just start to remember Meredith for who she was and draw a line under it.’

Meredith’s parents John and Arline had desperately wanted to be at the trial, she said, but both have health problems and were not able to travel.

Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito pictured days after Meredith's killing: They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively, after Sollecito¿s DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Meredith

The case began in November 2007 when Meredith’s body was discovered in her bedroom in the picturesque Umbrian university town of Perugia.

Knox and then boyfriend Sollecito immediately came under suspicion because of their strange behaviour.

After they were seen kissing and cuddling just yards from the murder scene investigators struck upon the theory of a sex game gone wrong. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively, after Sollecito’s DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Meredith, and both girls’ DNA was found on the alleged murder weapon

But four years later the couple were freed on appeal, after court-appointed experts dismissed much of the DNA evidence linking the couple to the murder scene.

Then in March last year Italy’s Supreme Court threw out their acquittal saying the appeal court judges displayed ‘a manifest lack of logic’.

And on Thursday, a court in Florence dramatically ruled that the pair were guilty, sentencing them to 28 and 25 years in prison, once the Supreme Court confirms the judgement.

Rudy Guede, a small time drug dealer from Ivory Coast, is serving a 16-year sentence for the murder.
