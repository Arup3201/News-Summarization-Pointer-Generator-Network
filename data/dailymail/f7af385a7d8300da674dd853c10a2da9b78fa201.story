One of Alex Salmond’s chief opponents has said his ‘blokeish attitude’ has put women off him during the referendum campaign on Scottish independence.

Margaret Curran, Labour’s spokesman on Scotland, was speaking after a poll found 51 per cent of women plan to vote against independence.

Only 32 per cent of female voters said they planned to vote in favour, and 17 per cent were still undecided.

Bloke: Salmond has been accused of putting off women, more of whom plan to reject Scottish independence

Among men, 41 per cent said they would vote Yes, 48 per cent would vote No and 11 per cent were undecided, according to the poll by Survation.

The poll showed the campaign to save the Union has more than doubled its lead to a record high since the TV debate between Mr Salmond and pro-Union Alastair Darling last Tuesday when the SNP leader failed to answer key questions about the pound.

Miss Curran said: ‘This blokeish attitude doesn’t work with people, especially women. I don’t think his recent performances have done him any favours.’

Women also voted in lower numbers than men for Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party during the 2011 elections – when the party promised a referendum on independence.

But earlier this month Miss Curran said there was some ‘very negative’ reaction to Mr Salmond personally on the doorstep, amid a continuing row about the currency. 

She said: ‘People believe he is so blinded by his dedication to independence that he’s thinking about that rather than their interests, and voters always expect you to think more about their interests.’

Labour's Margarert Curran added: 'The SNP have failed to have a message to women that works'

Women in particular, she said, were more likely to vote No, because they felt a ‘wider responsibility’ for others.

‘They have to think of their family, children, grandchildren and wider community’, she said. ‘The SNP have singularly failed to have a message to women that works.’ 

The poll of 1,010 Scots found that 57 per cent plan to vote No next month, a 14-point lead over Yes, once the ‘don’t knows’ are excluded.

This compares with a six-point lead last Sunday. It is the first time the No vote has exceeded 50 per cent since Survation began asking the question.

Yesterday it emerged Mr Salmond has refused to commission any research into a separate currency – despite UK politicians ruling out sharing the pound with an independent Scotland.

It led to taunts from his rivals that he had admitted he had no 'Plan B'. 

The Scottish Government turned down a Freedom of Information request by the Mail asking for all reports, correspondence and briefings on a new currency.

It admitted it does not hold the information because the government ‘proposes that currency will continue to be the currency of an independent Scotland’.

A row deepened also yesterday about the use of taxpayer-funded literature backing the independence campaign.

Last week all 2.5million households in the country received a 12-page glossy government booklet entitled ‘Scotland’s future – what independence means for you’.

It claimed that ‘we will get the government that Scotland votes for – every time’, a key SNP message, and that life would be ‘easier for families’ with more financial security.

This is despite major firms saying they would quit Scotland with thousands of job losses if it went independent, and research from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warning an independent Scotand would have to raise taxes or slash spending.

The Better Together campaign also has literature funded by the Scotland Office. But critics accused the Scottish civil service of becoming ‘politicised’ and refusing to reveal how much was spent on promotional materials.
