Being a mother is hard enough at the best of times. But for Claire Dinnen the experience is a particularly worrying ordeal

This is because her son Frankie falls and bangs his head up to 20 times a day - and doctors don't know why.

The mother-of-two is forced to watch the four-year-old cry in despair as he repeatedly drops to the ground.

Call: Desperate mum Claire Dinnen is trying to get medical treatment for her extremely frail son Frankie

He has suffered a string of injuries, including black eyes, and he has to sit in a pushchair when going out for his own safety.

Frankie even has to be carried to bed because of the risk of falling down the stairs.

Worse yet, Miss Dinnen from Rainham, Essex has waited six months to see a
specialist to find out what is wrong with her frail son while his 
condition is failing to improve.

She finally saw a paediatrician at Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, yesterday and Frankie is now due to have a MRI scan.

She said: 'I am happy that Frankie has finally got to see the paediatrician. But I am disgusted that it has taken so long for this to happen.'

She said last December Frankie was diagnosed with low muscle tone, a condition that makes his muscles stiff and lack firmness.

Claire said she was told the unsteady
child would need a series of further tests to find out the underlying 
cause of the condition, but was left waiting for six months for a follow-up appointment.

She said: 'I was fobbed off every time I called to find out about his appointment and how long he would have to wait.

'I am really worried now about poor Frankie's safety because he can't walk without falling and hitting his head.'

Claire said she first noticed something was seriously wrong with Frankie when he started walking at the relatively late age of two.

Frankie, who also has a twin sister called Stevie and older sister Stacie, 10, cannot walk down the road without falling.

Claire also fears that Frankie will hurt himself at school as she's not there to supervise and look after him.

She said: 'We have reached a stage where we are scared for him. He is just like any other boy, so he will run, but he will fall.

'I wish I could keep him at home to protect him. The school has reached the stage where they are finding it hard to look after him.'

A Queen's Hospital spokesman said there had been a delay in getting Frankie's referral notes over to the North East London Foundation Trust.
