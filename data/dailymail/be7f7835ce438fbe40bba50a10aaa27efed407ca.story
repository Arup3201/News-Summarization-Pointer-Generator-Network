New leader: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe casting his vote in July's elections. He said: 'Never will we go back on our victory'

Zimbabwe's longtime President Robert Mugabe today said his party will not yield its victory in the country's controversial elections last month.

In his first public speech since the elections, the 89-year-old President said: 'We are delivering democracy on a platter. Never will we go back on our victory'.

The July elections gave Mugabe 61 per cent of the vote, to outgoing Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's 34 per cent.

Speaking at the annual Heroes' Day gathering in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, Mugabe insisted that Zimbabweans voted freely and called on Tsvangirai to accept defeat.

'Those who are smarting from defeat can 
commit suicide if they so wish. But I tell them even dogs will not sniff
at their flesh if they choose to die that way,' he said.

He described Tsvangirai as the 
'enemy' in his party's midst during the shaky coalition brokered by 
regional leaders after the last disputed and violent poll in 2008. 

He said: 'We have thrown the enemy away like 
garbage. They say we have rigged, but they are thieves' because of 
corruption during their time in the government.

'We say to them: "You are
never going to rise again."'

Tsvangirai is challenging the poll results in court and has made accusation of widespread rigging within the system

In a message to his supporters 
marking the day, Tsvangirai said Zimbabweans are 'still shocked by the 
brazen manner in which their vote was stolen.'

'So many sons and daughters of this 
country sacrificed their lives ... and one of the fundamental rights 
they toiled at, died for was the right to vote,' he said. 

Mugabe's ZANU-PF party won 158 parliament seats on July 31 while the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won 50 seats.

Conduct: Morgan Tsvangirai called the election a 'sham'. Concerns over electoral conduct were raised when duplicate names and addresses appeared on the electoral roll

Victory: Robert Mugabe quashed claims that the election was a fraud. He described outgoing Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai as the 'enemy' and said: 'You are never going to rise again'

Democratic process: Voters who queued to take part in the elections were addressed by Mugabe, who said: 'We are delivering democracy on a platter'

Mugabe has accused his rival party of receiving money and backing from Britain and America.

In an hour-long address broadcast on state radio and television, Mugabe said: 'We are proving wrong those who say we are not able to conduct our affairs without outside interference'.

He said he thanked regional leaders 
and the continent-wide African Union organization for what he called 
'continuing to support our national efforts.'

African election observers have given
cautious approval of the vote but are still compiling their final 
report.

The Southern African Development Community, a regional political
and economic bloc, judged the polling itself peaceful and credible but 
has yet to pronounce it fair. 

Western nations, who Mugabe prevented
from sending observers, have condemned the vote for irregularities in 
voters' lists and elections procedures noted by independent local 
observers.
