A five-year-old Palestinian boy was filmed being dragged away for throwing a stone at Israeli soldiers who then blindfolded and handcuffed his father and marched them both in full public view to a police checkpost.

Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said seven soldiers and an officer detained the boy, named as Wadi' Maswadeh, in Hebron for two hours before handing him over to the Palestinian Police.

Video of the incident shows Wadi'a in floods of tears as he is dragged into an army vehicle before being taken to his home.

According to B'Tselem, his mother refused to let soldiers hand him over to Palestinian authorities until his father came home.

Around half an hour later, when the father Karam Maswadeh did return, both he and his son were taken to an Israeli army base where the father was blindfolded and handcuffed.

Mr Maswadeh said: 'When I got home, I saw several soldiers standing at the entrance to my house. An officer came up to me and ordered me to get my son, Wadi'a.

'Before I got home, the soldiers had tried to persuade my wife to hand Wadi'a over, but she had refused to do it until I came back.

'The officer told me that he was going to arrest Wadi'a and hand him over to the Palestinian Coordination.

'I asked him: "Why arrest a five-year-old boy?"

'A soldier standing next to the officer showed me a stone and claimed that my son had thrown it, and that it had hit the car of a settler who was driving north, near 'Abed checkpoint.

'I tried to persuade the officer not to take Wadi' to the DCO, but he said that if I didn't bring him, I'd be arrested. […] I went inside the house and got Wadi', who was hiding there. He was crying.'

After handcuffing and blindfolding Mr Maswadeh, the soldiers walked him  together with his son, in full public view, to a police checkpoint, where they were detained for a further thirty minutes.

At that point, a lieutenant colonel arrived whom the father, who speaks Hebrew, understood to be an Israeli coordination officer from the DCO.

The officer questioned Wadi' and asked
him why he had thrown stones. He also reprimanded the soldiers for 
arresting the father and son in the presence of video cameras, and 
complained that 'you're harming our public image'.

The officer made it clear to the soldiers that, when detainees are held with cameras around, they must be 'treated nicely.

At that point the father's hands were untied, his blindfold removed and he was given a drink of water.

The soldiers then handed the pair over to the Palestinian police. They were taken to a Palestinian police station and briefly questioned before being released.

B'Tselem Director Jessica Montell said detaining a child below the age of criminal responsibility, especially one so young, had no legal justification.

She said: 'The footage clearly shows that this was not a mistake made by an individual soldier, but rather conduct that, to our alarm, was considered reasonable by all the military personnel involved, including senior officers.

'It is particularly troubling that none of them apparently thought any part of the incident wad problematic: not the fact that they scared a five-year-old boy out of his wits, nor threatening him and his parents to 'hand him over' to the Palestinian Police, nor threatening to arrest the father on no legal grounds, nor handcuffing and blindfolding the father in front of his son.'
