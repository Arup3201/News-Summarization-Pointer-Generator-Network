One man is dead and another has suffered burns to 80 per cent of his body in an explosion at a Perth shopping centre.

Two other men were seriously injured in the explosion at the Galleria shopping centre in suburban Morley, about 8 kilometres northeast of Perth's central business district, at about 9.30am.

The cause of the explosion is unknown but lightning from a severe electrical storm has been ruled out.

A spokesman for St John Ambulance said some of the injured were electrical contractors inside a Woolworths store.

Three men were taken to Royal Perth Hospital with severe burns and one of the men is in a very serious condition with burns to 80 per cent of his body.

He was conscious and breathing when paramedics arrived.

'All of these people are in for a long stint in hospital,' the spokesman said. 

All four people are believed to have been working in an area near the electrical transformer, police said.  

Seven News journalist Amelia Broun wrote on Twitter: 'Witnesses have described seeing 4 people running out of the shopping centre burning from head to toe. @stjohn_wa says multiple injuries'.

Nine News reporter in Perth, Oliver Peterson, added: 'Witnesses say person has died. Was on fire. Tried to pour water on injured people. Explosion caused in power source.' 

A woman who was trying to assist the injured suffered smoke inhalation and was taken to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.

Several other people were treated for shock and smoke inhalation at the scene. 

WA Police said: 'About 9:30am this morning, Tuesday 3 February 2015, WA Police was called to the Morley Galleria shopping centre in relation to an explosion and fire.

'The fire has since been extinguished by the Department of Fire and Emergency Services.

'One person is confirmed deceased, and three others are being treated for injuries they received, one of which is in a critical condition. It is believed all four persons were working in an area near the electrical transformer.'

Witness Jonathan McDonagh was among several people who tried to help the injured, taking off his shirt and using it to put out the flames.

He described the scene as horrific, panicked and rushed.

'I came driving in and saw three people come running out ... they were on fire,' Mr McDonagh told AAP.

Two other men were seriously injured in the explosion at the Galleria shopping centre in suburban Morley about 9.30am 

'I had the radio on and didn't hear the bang, but I saw a puff of smoke.

'One fella was dead on the ground. I saw another moving around, obviously not OK.

'I gave him a good helping hand, as much as I could. They were really burnt badly.'

The Department of Fire and Emergency Services has cordoned off the scene.

EnergySafe and WorkSafe are investigating the incident.

A Woolworths spokesperson said 'the explosion was in a switchboard in part of the Morley shopping centre.' 

The shopping centre is still open, a spokeswoman from the Morley Galleria told Fairfax Media.

Nine reporter Peterson told ABC720 Perth that the blackened  site of the explosion had been sealed off from public view.

'It's very chaotic scenes down here at the moment,' he said.

Local man Chris Spencer told the website In My Community he arrived at the Galleria shortly after the blast and saw 'one lady who was in tears outside the shop near where it happened'.

Another shopper at the scene named Kiara told Daily Mail Australia: 'Half the shopping centre is shut down the Woolworths end due to no electricity.'

Woolworths said in a statement that the store had been evacuated.

'This incident occurred on Morley Galleria property controlled by Federation Centres. It did not occur in the Woolworths store or area managed by Woolworths,' the statement said.

'Our thoughts are with those injured in the incident. Unfortunately we understand WA Police have confirmed there has been a fatality and our thoughts are with family and friends.'
