Roberto Martinez was proud of his Everton side after they battled for more than an hour with 10 men before ultimately bowing out of the FA Cup on penalties at West Ham.

The Hammers prevailed 9-8 in the shootout to go into the fourth round after the scores were tied at 2-2 after extra time, but Martinez drew comfort from the way his side responded to Aiden McGeady being sent off early in the second half.

Enner Valencia had put the hosts in front before McGeady was given his marching orders, but Everton got back into the game through a wonderfully-struck Kevin Mirallas free-kick.

West Ham won 9-8 in the shootout to go into the fourth round after the scores were tied at 2-2 after extra time 

Second-half substitute Mirallas then teed up Romelu Lukaku in extra-time to put the Toffees ahead, only for West Ham's Carlton Cole to poke home with his first touch and take the tie to penalties.

Steven Naismith missed Everton's second but Stewart Downing passed up the chance to seal the win when his tame fifth effort was kept out by Joel Robles, who had made a string of impressive saves throughout the game.

How cruel, therefore that the Spanish goalkeeper - who won the competition with Wigan two years ago - thrashed his own penalty against the bar and could not keep out Adrian's effort as West Ham made it through.

'We had to deal with the worst role in the game - going down to 10 men for over an hour. I'm extremely satisfied with the manner of coping with that,' Martinez said.

'The players showed the right manner and concentration and we didn't for a minute look like team with a man down. We showed a very good, strong mentality. It is just disappointing.

'West Ham were really strong but I thought we deserved to go through. The effort and performance made us the better team tonight. Penalties really is a tough way to be eliminated from best competition in club football.'

The Spaniard was also left bemoaning a decision to not award his side a penalty when they were 2-1 up in extra-time.

'You can see why he gave the two yellow cards (to McGeady) but there is no justification in how the referee has not seen (that) Mirallas' free-kick was in the box,' he added.

'He has given a free-kick outside the box and clearly it's in the box. The linesman has given it and should've seen the action in the box. '

Martinez's opposite number Sam Allardyce described the topsy-turvy contest as 'unbelievable' as it showcased the magic of the cup.

'The highs and lows in one particular game. It has been a long time since I experienced such highs and lows in one match. Such excitement. It was end to end from the first whistle - nothing like a Premier League game,' he said.

Martinez on the referee's decision to send McGeady off: 'You can see why he gave the two yellow cards'

'Both teams went out and played and tried to win it. In the end we got what we deserved, there is no doubt about that.

'Unfortunately we missed too many chances, their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves. We had 23, 24 attempts. We missed and fluffed a few and had to rely on penalties in the end to win it.

'Everton have been a bit of a bogey team for us and when Stewart Downing missed it I thought 'here we go again'.

'But Adrian saved one brilliantly and took the last one, he was calm. He was determined and it was a victory we deserved over the two legs.'
