Some videos and images taken from the ISS are so incredible that they can leave you questioning their authenticity.

But this time-lapse of an aurora surrounding the ISS as it completes an orbit of our planet is very much the real deal.

The amazing footage was captured by Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst on the station last week.

Above can be seen an animation of the moment Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst and his crewmates on the ISS spottted an aurora around the ISS. The green light is caused by the interaction of solar wind with particles in Earth's atmosphere. Part of the huge solar array can also be seen moving (credit: Esa/Nasa)

The time-lapse was created by photographs taken on board the ISS by members of the Expedition 40 crew.

There are two types of aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’

As their names imply, the former are seen in the northern hemisphere and the latter in the southern hemisphere. 

They are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field.

Usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light.

As a result, auroras are most common around the magnetic poles and are most often seen in areas with little light pollution. 

Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been reported.

The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (320km).

Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora. 

It shows the station orbiting the planet as normal before green lights begin to come into view.

The ISS then flies right through the aurora, revealing a stunning sight that only a handful of people have seen with their own eyes. 

‘We flew right through a massive aurora after last week’s solar mass ejection,’ Gerst, from Germany, commented.

The ISS completes an orbit every 92 minutes, but sights of this sort are fairly rare.

While auroras have certainly been spotted from space before, it’s not all that common for the station to fly through one.

This is because the station’s orbit generally remains fairly close to the the equator, so it doesn’t venture too far towards the poles of our planet.

It is around the North and South pole where auroras are generally most apparent, as this is where Earth’s magnetic fields are most concentrated.

Auroras are caused by the interaction of solar wind with magnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.

However, during periods of increased solar activity the amount of solar wind hitting Earth increases.

This means there are more collisions taking place in Earth’s atmosphere and, consequently, this can push the lights closer to Earth’s equator.

It is on occasions like this that more regions of Earth are able to witness the Northern or Southern Lights, with auroras sometimes reported as far south as the UK during these events.

And it seems that a recent increase in solar activity also treated the residents of the ISS to the fascinating sight.

The ISS (pictured) completes an orbit every 92 minutes, but sights of this sort are fairly rare. While auroras have certainly been spotted from space before, it’s not all that common for the station to fly through one. This is because the station’s orbit generally keeps it fairly near the equator

The astronauts are continuing their groundbreaking research on the ISS, with a new crew set to travel to the station next month, while Russian cosmonauts are also preparing for a spacewalk today.

And recently Alexander Gerst took part in a live Facebook Q&A to answer questions from people on Earth.

One included Sir Richard Branson, who asked: ‘What do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years’ time? Pioneers? Guides? Or the norm?’

Gerst responded: ‘My hope would be that in 50 years from now, space travellers will not only be professional Agency astronauts, but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience I am having right now.

‘Anyway, I hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away.’

Alexander Gerst (pictured) is part of Expedition 40 on the ISS. Next month they will be welcoming three new crewmembers to the space station when three of the current crew return to Earth. Gerst has been prolific on Twitter (@Astro_Alex) and frequently tweets stunning images and video from space

The event occurred after a period of increased solar activity last week

When the sun is more active auroras are seen above Earth at lower latitudes

This makes them visible to astronauts on the ISS and also to observers on Earth closer to the equator

@highlight

They are usually only visible near Earth's North and South poles where the magnetic fields are strongest

They are caused by the interaction of solar wind with magnetically charged particles in Earth's atmosphere

When the sun is more active an increase in solar wind pushes them lower
