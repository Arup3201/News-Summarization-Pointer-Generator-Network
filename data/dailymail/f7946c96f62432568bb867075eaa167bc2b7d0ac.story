A broccoli smoothie from created by a mother in the former Soviet Union in order to make her son eat his greens has become a surprise best-seller in upmarket UK stores.

The Savse Smoovie, which reputedly slows down ageing, is selling so fast at 
retailers including Harrods and Harvey Nichols that suppliers have had 
to increase stock twenty-fold to keep up with demand.

And its unique selling point is that it tastes nothing like broccoli and is in fact sweet, a trick Georgian mother Nina Koutibashvili came up with when she invented the drink in the 1980s in order to encourage her children to eat their green vegetables.

The project began when Nina was diagnosed with an iron deficiency during pregnancy 27 years ago in Georgia. Her doctor advised her to drink a blend of spinach and apple juice, so Nina set about juicing a mixture of vegetables and fruits.

She loved the taste so much she has been developing and juicing her recipes ever since, convincing her children to love vegetables via her delicious drinks.

In 2011, Nina and her son Guka Tavberidze - who was curious as to why he could never find smoothies as good as his mother's - decided to bring the secret recipe into the mainstream

Guka took the old family recipe
and developed a cold-pressure machine to crush the vegetables using 
90,000lbs per square inch, the equivalent of being crushed by a herd of
elephants.

Broccoli flavour: Broccoli, pear, spinach, kale, kiwi, lemon, banana

Beetroot flavour: Beetroot, apple, lemon, avocado, lime, mango, red pepper

Strawberry flavour: Strawberry, broccoli, celery, kale, orange, spinach

The resulting Savse Smoovies - available in broccoli, beetroot and strawberry flavours - are now sold in 250ml bottles for £2.49 in health food sections of high-end British stores including Planet Organic, Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason.

In blind taste-test carried out before the product's launch, 98 per cent of those asked to guess what they were tasting could not detect broccoli.

That has helped make it popular with parents trying to find new ways to encourage their children to eat more leafy green vegetables when they often cannot stand the taste.

Unlike many other smoothies, the Savse ingredients do not need to be heated and pasteurised in production - a common process which prevents decay but sees fruit and veg lose much of their nutritional value.

Savse Smoovies are also available in beetroot and strawberry flavour

The properties of broccoli are said to help boost the nervous and immune systems and help to prevent the formation of cancers.

Guka said: 'We're absolutely thrilled by and proud of the reaction to our invention. Most people who blind taste test Savse simply don't even believe that it contains vegetables.

'It tastes like an ultra-fresh version of a standard smoothie with a slightly zingier flavour.'

Savse Smoovies are available in three different flavours - broccoli, strawberry and beetroot
