An elderly New York drug dealer who  jumped bail and fled from one of upstate New York’s biggest drug cases has been caught in Oregon after 20 years on the run.

John Franklin Forbis, 72, was arrested on Thursday at his home on Deadwood Road west of Eugene in the Coast Range, Sergeant Carrie Carver of the Lane County sheriff’s office said. 

The elderly fugitive was caught after he  fell ill and applied for Social Security benefits using his true identity, according to the sheriff's office.

Forbis appeared bald and grizzled after Lane County Sheriff’s Office caught the 72-year-old on the edge of the coastal Siuslaw National Forest where he’s been hiding out under a pseudonym.

But in his younger days, he had  specialized in making marijuana-infused rum.

 In 1992, he vanished  from Hudson, New York after saying that he planned to flee to Turkey.

Columbia County District Attorney Paul Czajka told the Daily News: 'He was the only defendant that I could remember essentially losing.'

A judge's denial of Czajka’s request of a $2 million bail led to Forbis' escape.

He posted part of his $150,000 bail shortly after New York State Police caught him with $1 million worth of marijuana which was hidden in a storage shed.

That amount of pot would be worth more than $1.6 million today with the rate of inflation factored in.

At the time police raided his property they found 850 pounds of marijuana in trash bags which were thought to have come from  the Gallatin area, Czajka added.

Even though he wasn’t in the courtroom, a jury in Columbia County, New York, convicted Forbis in 1992 of a drug charge. 

He was found guilty of first-degree possession of marijuana, a Class A felony, and convicted  to five to 15 years in prison. 

In 2012, the case was reopened. 

'It’s the biggest pot case we’ve ever had' Czajka said.  

Forbis is due to be extradited back to New York and  taken to the Department of Corrections where he will finally serve his sentence.
