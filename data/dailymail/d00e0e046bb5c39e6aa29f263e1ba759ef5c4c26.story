Natalee Holloway's accused killer will get to marry his pregnant girlfriend in a prison ceremony while serving a 28-year sentence for young Peruvian woman's murder.

Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, 26, remains the main suspect in Holloway's 2005 disappearance from Aruba, where she was on a high school vacation. She was 18 years old at the time, and her body was never found.

On Friday, Van der Sloot will marry pregnant fianceé Leidy Figueroa, 24, at Lima's Pedras Gordas penitentiary in a midday ceremony.

The two met at the prison, where Figueroa sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. She is currently due to give birth to his child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy.

Van der Sloot is currently in prison for confessing to killing 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores  at a Lima casino in 2010. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2012.

Van der Sloot is also suspected of killing 18-year-old Holloway, who vanished during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 and was last seen with him and another man.

The Alabama teen's body has not been found and Van der Sloot has denied involvement in her disappearance.

Peru has said it will extradite Van der Sloot to the United States for questioning about the Holloway case but only after he finishes his jail term.

In the U.S. he will faces charges for accepting $25,000 from Holloway's mom to lead her to the girl's body, something he never did.
