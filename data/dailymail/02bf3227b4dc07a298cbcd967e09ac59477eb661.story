A woman was forced to 'sit and watch' her electricity meter for 39 days by her energy supplier, because they couldn't tell her when her tariff had changed.

Sue Hufton was told by Scottish Power call centre staff that the only way to work out when the cheap rate started and finished, was to wait and watch.

She then checked her teleswitch meter every five minutes in an attempt to record when the meter was switching.

Mrs Hufton, 58, of Leicestershire, said: 'I lost the will to live in the end. It was so frustrating.'

She is one of a number of people who contacted consumer rights magazine Which? for advice on checking meter clocks. She had been concerned because her bill was a third higher than for similar neighbouring properties last summer.

An investigation by the magazine showed that families - including those on tariffs such as Economy 7 or Economy 10 - could have been overcharged without knowing it.

It is because energy suppliers are not required to check the accuracy of meter clocks when taking readings.

After the magazine intervened, Scottish Power contacted her to give her the answer she had been looking for.

It revealed that her bills were high because she was using electricity during peak time, erroneously assuming it was the cheaper rate.

She said: 'My supplier was so objectionable about giving me this information that I thought maybe I was not entitled to it. I feel I have been treated pretty shabbily.'

A Which? spokeswoman told the Sunday Express: 'It’s outrageous that consumers are being left to work out the hours on their Economy 7 tariffs. It’s this kind of poor customer service that erodes trust in the energy industry.'

Mrs Hufton has since received an apology, a bouquet and was reimbursed £75 for expenses incurred.

A Scottish Power spokesman said: 'Scottish Power aims to provide a high standard of service at all times and we are sorry that Mrs Hufton did not receive the level of service expected.'

Energy
tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd consumers can take advantage of 
this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to 
ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will 
save you significant amounts.

Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

If you are one of the millions of
people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original 
supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly 
as much as £300 a year.

Prices
are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff
that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.
