The accusation has come after the alleged Jimmy Savile sex-abuse scandal

A British TV celebrity has been accused of sexually abusing a woman.

An alleged victim has come forward after the ITV 
documentary that claimed Jimmy Savile molested underage girls to tell producers that she was abused by a 
well-known media figure when she was a child.

The new allegations concern a TV personality who is still alive, but he has not been named.

The woman made the new claims first to the makers of the 'Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile' documentary, who have advised her to contact the police.

A member of the ITV production team claimed: 'We have had a name given to us which is so far not in the public domain.

'It relates to a celebrity, a media 
personality, who is alive. We are urging everyone who contacts us to go 
straight to the police.'

When ITV were asked for a comment today about the latest allegation, spokesman Tom Hodson said: 'I will look into this.'

The latest claims come after the slew of accusations against Savile, who died aged 84 in October last year.

The former Top of the Pops star is alleged to have molested underage girls and assaulted sick children in their hospital beds.

New claims allege that Savile groped children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Leeds General Infirmary and at Broadmoor.

A former Broadmoor patient Alison Pink, claimed Savile groped her while she watched TV. A former nurse at the Leeds hospital where Savile worked as a porter, said he molested a brain-damaged hospital patient.

June Thornton said she was recovering from an operation at Leeds General Infirmary when she saw Savile abuse the young girl.

'She had brain damage, and Jimmy Savile came in and kissed her,' she said.

'He started kissing her neck, running his hands up and down her arms, and then started to molest her.

'Because I was laid flat on my back, there was nothing I could do.'

Leeds General Infirmary said it had received two complaints after the allegations against Savile became public almost two weeks ago.

Nurses at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire are understood to have dreaded Savile’s visits because of his behaviour, and would tell children to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when he arrived.

Stoke Mandeville – a spinal injuries specialist centre in aid of  which Savile frequently ran marathons – insisted it had ‘no record’ of complaints about him.
