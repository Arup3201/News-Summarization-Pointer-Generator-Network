For years he charmed members of the smart country set, from the wife of the 9th Earl of Bathurst to the teenage daughter of a Cotswolds millionaire.

But former vagrant Oliver Lomasney – once renowned for his ‘Lady and the Tramp’ relationships – is  a ‘deeply unpleasant man’ who women should avoid at all costs, a judge has warned.

He imposed a three-month prison sentence on the 42-year-old for assaulting his latest lover, with whom he previously enjoyed an ‘Olympic’ sex life, a court heard.

In 1997, Lomasney was in the headlines 
when Lady Sara Apsley took pity on him when she saw him begging near her
 estate, Circencester Park, in Gloucestershire.

The wife of the Earl
 of Bathurst found him work and a roof over his head, but he repaid her 
kindness weeks later by running away with Cheltenham Ladies’ College 
schoolgirl Christine Hulbert.

The 16-year-old, whose millionaire New 
York academic father lived in the Cotswolds, professed her enduring love
 for Lomasney, saying she would rather they be homeless together than 
agree to her horrified family’s wishes and end the relationship.

He 
fathered a son, Kane, with Christine before leaving her for another 
teenager, Pearl Nepgen, months later, going on to wed dental nurse Helen
 Carter. But the marriage ended in dramatic fashion, with Lomasney 
jailed for three and a half years in 2007 for brutally assaulting her 
following the break-up.

The judge at the time said Lomasney was 
‘prone to abusive behaviour with partners and I agree that anyone in a 
relationship with you is at risk’.

Now a second judge has warned 
women to stay away from him after hearing a depressingly similar saga 
following his latest relationship.

The lover this time, a mother of 
two from South Brent, Devon, spent five months in a ‘slightly avant 
garde’ relationship with Lomasney, during which they ‘indulged in an 
adventurous sex life’ where role-playing reached new levels, Plymouth 
Crown Court was told.

Defence barrister Rupert Taylor told the judge:
 ‘Mr Lomasney is a colourful character who in the old days had a Lady 
and the Tramp experience.’

Describing the latest relationship, he 
said: ‘Things had become more Olympic and there was some unacceptable 
violence and he has pleaded guilty to that.’

Prosecutor Greg 
Richardson said the woman decided to end their relationship because of 
his aggression towards her, telling him it was over after they had a 
meal and some drink and going upstairs to her bed.

But she was woken 
by a blow to her face and he was standing over her. ‘His hand was 
clenched around her throat and she could barely breathe,’ Mr Richardson 
said. ‘She could not push him off and he grabbed her hair.

‘He made 
various threats to beat her up, hit her again and told her he knew 
people in prison who would cut her up. He brandished a Stanley knife in 
her face.’

The terrified woman’s children, aged between six and nine,
 were in the house. The court heard Lomasney had four previous 
convictions for ‘offences against the person’ and now lives in a caravan
 on a farm in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, where he works as a labourer.

Recorder Steven Levene told him: ‘You are a deeply unpleasant man. You are a bullying, controlling, unpleasant man.’

The
 judge said he hoped the publicity surrounding the case would be wide 
enough to warn ‘any unfortunate woman’ Lomasney might meet in the 
future.

He imposed a three-month jail term – which meant Lomasney 
could walk free immediately due to the seven months he has spent on 
remand – and an indefinite restraining order, which the judge said 
‘protects one woman at least’.

Lomasney’s first brush with polite 
society came when Lady Apsley saw him begging outside her local Tesco in
 1997 and began buying him sandwiches. At the time, she said: ‘Oliver 
seemed such a nice chap. Everyone deserves fair treatment as far as I am
 concerned.’

But her faith proved misplaced after he eloped with the
 teenaged Miss Hulbert, forcing her to admit that she had been ‘perhaps a
 little misguided’ in taking him in.
