Binmen have been banned from carrying rubbish bags just 60 yards to their lorries for 'health and safety' reasons.

Council officials have ordered that the bags left in a residential square in Canterbury, Kent, should only be picked up if the rubbish truck could drive directly to them.

A spokesman said: 'Picking up bags and carrying them some distance down the road to wherever the dustcart can stop is not acceptable for the safety of the binmen.'

Binmen in parts of Canterbury have been banned from carrying rubbish bags just a few yards to their trucks -- for health and safety reasons

It comes after householders complained some of their rubbish was going uncollected.

Local Labour councillor Alan Baldock said the edict was ‘a complete c**k- up’.

He said: 'How is it all right for an old person to carry their bin bags to somewhere else and not all right for a binman to do the same?

'That seems bizarre and contradictory.

'Why don’t they just send a smaller truck round?

'Instead, we’ve got rubbish going uncollected. It’s a disgrace and another example that this council’s bin collection system is not fit for purpose.'

Roads affected by the rules include the city’s Notley Street, Clyde Street and Alma Street which form a square.

Roads affected by the rules include the city's Notley Street, Clyde Street and Alma Street which form a square. The council say because the roads are too narrow to drive a lorry down the bins mus tbe brought to the truck, rather than binmen being forced to carry them

The area is only about 60 yards across but the city council insists the purple rubbish sacks are carried to the Serco trucks by residents.

Catherine Davis said she had been having problems with her weekly collection at her Alma Street home since Christmas.

She said: 'The binmen should not pretend that they can’t carry the rubbish to somewhere else or make other arrangements.

'If they can’t get into the road then they should tell us they can’t and tell us somewhere else where we can leave our rubbish for collection.'

Janet Varley, of Clyde Street, added: 'It’s ridiculous that they can’t get their trucks round. I don’t believe that.

'I have complained so many times about this that they must be getting sick of me.'

The ruling emerged after householders complained some of their rubbish was going uncollected. Council officials in Canterbury, Kent said the bags would only be picked up if the rubbish truck could drive directly to them

Council spokesman Rob Davies said: 'Our agreed collection method is for rubbish to be picked up at the kerbside, and we have equipment and machinery to enable that to happen for the vast majority of properties.

'Picking up bags and carrying them some distance down the road to wherever the dustcart can stop is not acceptable for the safety of the binmen.

'In addition, leaving a dustcart in one location for a significant period of time while this happens can potentially lead to obstruction and inconvenience.

'These streets are quite narrow and there are often vehicles parked in such a way that makes it difficult for the trucks to get access.

'The council and Serco staff have this week been in the area looking at potential ways to resolve the problem in these streets.'
