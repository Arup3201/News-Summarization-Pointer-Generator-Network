A pensioner who became so furious at cyclists using the shared path outside her home took revenge - by covering a cycling Cambridge Don with dog waste.

Susan Currall, 75, who has previous convictions for assault, hit out when Cambridge Don Michael Ramage narrowly missed her on his bike.

She swung a full poop-a-scoop bag at him and it split and covered the architecture expert in excrement.

Currall, a former British Embassy worker, called the academic 'a big bully' and told him 'go cry to your mummy'

Currall, a former British Embassy worker, called the academic ‘a big bully’ and told him ‘go cry to your mummy’.

She was charged with assault and ordered to appear before magistrates in Cambridge where she admitted the offence.

The court heard that Currall has been waging a long-running feud with cyclists over the shared path outside her home in the city.

Monica Lentin, mitigating, said the pensioner 'felt anxious' walking along the path because of cyclists speeding past.

She said: 'I think many people who are pedestrians in Cambridge would agree that having cyclists and pedestrians together doesn’t work.

'The pedestrians do feel extremely harassed and I feel the same way myself.

'What makes it worse is you get lots of young men with powerful bikes riding at speed without any conscience that older people can’t get out of the way easily.

'These young people come hurtling towards her and they do not give way to her.'

She added: 'She did not see him coming in the opposite direction and he was not stopping for her which certainly in the olden days, a man on a bike would have got off and let her through.'

American-born Mr Ramage, 40, who is a fellow at Sidney Sussex College, said the incident on September 12 had left him shaken.

'I’ve encountered her with my kids and it’s upsetting for them,' he said.

'Hopefully the sentence will mean something to her and change her behaviour so I think I’m happy from that point of view.'

Currall was ordered to pay £25 for Mr Ramage’s dry cleaning plus £100 court costs and given a one-year conditional discharge.

Presiding magistrate Rosie Wenham said: 'We order a small amount of compensation to cover the cost of any dry cleaning that Mr Ramage would have to do.'

After the case she said she did not intend the bag to split and said the fact she had ended up in court was 'ridiculous'

Currall also has two cautions for common assault and criminal damage from 2007.

Currall was today pictured walking her dog Rosie near her Cambridge home.

She said: 'Now I’m the one in the s***.'

The angry dog walker added: 'The bag might have split a little but I certainly did not tip it on him.

'He didn’t even stop and get off his bike.

'He just yelled at me that he was going to call the police.

'But I then made the situation worse by saying "oh are you going to call your mummy as well?" In a baby voice, before walking away.

'I’ve worked in America for five years where people speak their mind.

'In England people are too complacent. I wasn’t going to stand back and keep letting him push me around.'
