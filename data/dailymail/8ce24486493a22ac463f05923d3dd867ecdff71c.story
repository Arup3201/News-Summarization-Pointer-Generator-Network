An advertising agency has hit upon a unique way of catching the attention of people living in ad-saturated Tokyo - use women's thighs as a living billboard.

Consumers in the Japanese megalopolis are notoriously hard to reach because of the sheer abundance of billboards, neon signs and huge TV screens pumping out commercials, so the WIT agency decided to put ads on a place men are happy to pay attention to.

'It's an absolutely perfect place to put an advertisement as it's what guys are eager to look at and girls are OK to expose,' said Hidenori Atsumi, the CEO of WIT.

The CEO of the ad agency says women are comfortable with exposing their thighs and men like staring at them

And it's proving popular - so far more than 3,000 women have signed up to the scheme, which uses temporary tattoos of products or company logos.

One of them is Miho Matsumoto, who says she is comfortable with the unusual marketing method.

She said: 'I wouldn't do this of they put it on my belly or other places I'm embarassed to expose but if it's on my chubby thighs then what's the problem?

ITV reports that in order to be a walking billboard, participants must be 18-years-old and are required to have at least 20 friends on social media networks.

The girls can wear what they like, but WIT suggests that participants wear short skirts and high socks in order to draw attention to the ad. They can earn up to £65 per day.

American rock band Green Day and the Seth MacFarlane film 'Ted' have already been seen thigh-high in the Japanese capital, and many more companies are believed to be interested.

Selling ad space is nothing new. In 2005, American Karolyne Smith was paid £6500 by GoldenPalace.com, an internet casino renowned for outrageous advertising, to permanently tattoo its website address on her forehead.

She said that she did it to raise funds for her son's private school tuition.

The girls can wear what they like, but are encouraged to don short skirts and high socks in order to draw attention to the ad. They can earn up to £65 per day
