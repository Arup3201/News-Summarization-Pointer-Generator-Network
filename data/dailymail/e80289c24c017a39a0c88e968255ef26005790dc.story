Two female bank employees were subjected to years of sexual harassment and bullying by managers and clients, a tribunal heard.

Maria Rayworth and Deena Rosario Al Bazi claim they were subjected to lewd behaviour by customers and were not backed up by bosses at the Arab National Bank in London.

In one incident, Mrs Bazi, 57, kneed a former chairman of the bank in the groin to stop him making advances to her in a lift.

‘As soon as the doors of the lift closed, he threw himself against me and tried to kiss me,’ she said. ‘I managed to bring one of my knees up and knee him in the private parts. I was very scared but also really shocked.’

Deena Bazi, left, says she was subjected to constant bullying by male bosses. Maria Rayworth, right, said she was bombarded with lewd texts by a bank client

But when she reported it to her boss, general manager Safwan Afifi, he was surprised at her attitude. ‘I went upstairs and told Mr Afifi what had happened. He was shocked I had pushed him away and resisted,’ she said. ‘He told me, “My God, This is the chairman of the bank and you did this to the chairman of the bank, you will get into trouble for this”.’

The incident took place in 2006. Mrs Bazi, who was the bank’s £39,000-a-year relationship manager, said that on another occasion a customer, who knew her husband was dying of motor neurone disease, asked intimate questions about her sex life.

Mrs Rayworth, 46, said a former board member had asked her why she was childless – then offered to impregnate her. When she complained to Mr Afifi, she said, he laughed and told her: ‘What do you want me to do about it, he’s a board member.’

Mrs Rayworth, who was the £36,000-a-year head of customer service, said a client cornered her and fondled her belly when she did fall pregnant, saying: ‘How’s my baby?’

Another client would grope her legs when sitting next to her in meetings and started texting her ‘all times of the day and night’.

‘He would tell me he was in the shower, and ask me if I was thinking of him,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I felt shocked, degraded and physically sick.

‘Nothing was ever done. It was absolutely clear to me that management expected female members of staff to put up with harassing behaviour from clients, particularly if they were VIPs.’

However the bank claims no such harassment took place and there were no records she had ever made a formal complaint.

Mrs Rayworth said Mr Afifi’s deputy, Stephen Blyth would constantly scratch his groin and play with himself through his trousers in front of her.

Mrs Bazi alleges that she and other female staff were subjected to constant bullying by Mr Blyth and Mr Afifi.

However Rebecca Tuck, for the bank, said of Mr Afifi, who left the bank in March 2013: ‘He was a bully to male members of staff, not just female ones.’

The two women who claim sex discrimination, each worked for the bank for more than 20 years. Mrs Bazi, who also claims unfair dismissal, was sacked by the bank for allegedly authorising a fraudulent payment in the summer of 2013. Mrs Rayworth resigned last December after she received a formal warning over the same fraud and was left suffering from severe depression.

The women were disciplined after they transferred $170,000 from a client’s bank account to accounts in America, after being tricked into believing the transactions had been authorised by him. A fraudster had hacked the client’s email accounts to request the transfer and also hacked Mrs Bazi’s emails.

The bank claims the women should have called the client to ensure he had wanted the money transferred.

Mrs Rayworth told the tribunal that in 2012, when there was a $520,000 fraud the bank employee involved had not even received a verbal warning.

Mrs Bazi told the tribunal: ‘I was treated less favourably than male colleagues. Mr Blyth and Mr Afifi believed that I thought I was above them and that as a woman I had got too big for my boots.’

The bank said the women had made up or overstated their claims, and that bosses did act on their complaints about customers’ behaviour.

Miss Tuck said of Mrs Bazi’s claims: ‘These were scurrilous allegations. When there was a grain of truth in them you grossly exaggerated them.’

The tribunal continues.
