With a bow to the crowd, Anderson Silva weighed in on the middleweight limit ahead of his long-awaited return the Octagon against Nick Diaz.

The Brazilian superstar has been out of action for a year after snapping his leg in his rematch with Chris Weidman at the same MGM Grand he fights at on Saturday night.

Silva scaled 186lb while Diaz weighed one pound less on his own return after two years out.

'I'm so happy because one year ago I broke my leg,' Silva said. 'When I talked to my family, they said don't go back to fight. But this is my life, thank you for everything.

'I got to fight for all the people here.'

Diaz said simply: 'We're taking on the world here, one fight at a time.'

Silva has been promised a shot at the title should he overcome Diaz but he will have to bide his time after champion Weidman pulled out of his defence against Vitor Belfort at UFC 184 next month with a rib injury. 

Women's bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey will now headline against Cat Zingano.

Earlier, Silva said he would continue to wear Nike clothing, despite the UFC signing a groundbreaking deal with rivals Reebok.

All fighters will be expected to wear the new brand from July but Silva said he would remain loyal to his previous sponsor.

'When you wear a brand, it needs to be true; there must be a connection,' he told Terra. 'I don’t identify with Reebok at all.

'I’ve always worn Nike, even before I had a contract with them. Just because our ties are severed, it doesn’t mean I’ll stop wearing it. It feels true; it’s a brand with which I identify. It’s no use to sport a brand to which I have no relationship.'
