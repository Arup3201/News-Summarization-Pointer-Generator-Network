Roland Wright was today convicted of abusing five boys while he worked at Caldicott Prep School in the 1950s and 60s

Nick Clegg’s former headmaster was facing jail yesterday after being  convicted of sexually abusing pupils over a decade at one of England’s leading prep schools.

Roland Peter Wright molested five young boys at Caldicott Prep School after luring them to his room to watch television and drink whiskey in his bed.

He taught French and sport at the all-boy school and targeted older pupils, aged 12 to 13, who were gifted athletes.

Now the 83-year-old paedophile faces jail after being found guilty on 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of indecency with a child between 1959 and 1970 at Aylesbury Crown Court.

Wright was headmaster of the prestigious school – which is a  popular ‘feeder’ school for Eton and Harrow and charges annual fees  of £20,000 – for 25 years, retiring  in 1993.

The Deputy Prime Minister spent five years at the Buckinghamshire school from 1975, several years after the abuse occurred.

Wright - also known by his middle name Peter - will be sentenced at a later date.

The offences on boys aged between eight and 13 spanned from September 1959 to August 1970.

The jury heard how Wright ran the school’s rugby team and would choose a favourite child who would be given rides in his sports car.

He would also invite them to his bedsit to watch television and drink whisky.

The trial heard Wright would invite children into his room where they would be abused.

One former pupil said in evidence at the trial in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that Wright created an atmosphere where boys wanted to please him.

'Boys like me and a lot of others fell for Peter Wright. We had a crush on him,' he said.

'What we wanted was his approval.'

Hugh Henry, another teaching contemporary of Wright’s at the school, in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose after being caught in a boy’s bed back in the 60s.

He has already admitted a number of offences and also falls to be sentenced.

The deputy Prime Minister spent five years at Caldicott from 1975, and was not a pupil at the time of the abuse.

The other teachers at Caldicott Prep School have been convicted of child sex offences

Wright became headmaster in 1968 after already being at the school for a decade, and retired in 1993.

Fellow teachers John Addrison, Edward Carson and Hugh Henry were also previously convicted of child sexual offences at the school.

The Crown Prosecution Service said today Wright and the other teachers' position of responsibility increased the seriousness of the crimes.

Ruth Bowskill, the temporary Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern area, said: 'This case marks the end of a series of prosecutions of four teaching staff involved in the serious sexual abuse of a number of children at Caldicott school in Buckinghamshire committed over a period of a decade.

'The position of trust held by these men, the young age of the victims and their vulnerability at the time of the abuse greatly increases the seriousness of these already grave offences.

'Roland Peter Wright was a particularly trusted member of staff at Caldicott school and became the headteacher.

'Not only did he breach the trust of the pupils at the school, their parents and the staff, Wright also abused his position of authority in order to gain access to his victims.'

She commended the former pupils for their determination, adding: 'It is only due to the great courage and persistence of the victims and those affected by the abuse that the despicable behaviour of these teachers at the school has been exposed.

'Roland Peter Wright has never shown any contrition for his behaviour or apologised for his conduct; at all times he has sought to evade responsibility for what he did.

'I would like to pay tribute to the victims and witnesses in this case for their strength and tenacity in coming forward and giving evidence on matters which must have been extremely distressing still years after the events took place.

'The emotional impact on Wright's victims and those of the other teachers is impossible to quantify.

'I hope that the convictions give some small comfort to the victims involved.'
