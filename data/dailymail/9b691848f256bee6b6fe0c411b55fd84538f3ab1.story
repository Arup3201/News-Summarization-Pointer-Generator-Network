This dramatic video shows how a Police Community Support Officer who pulled over a driver was then arrested himself for being twice the drink-drive limit - by officers he had called for back-up.

PCSO Andrew Seston signalled for motorist Irfan Mehrban to stop his vehicle outside a school in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, then called for assistance when the driver began arguing with him.

But when his colleagues arrived they suspected 44-year-old Seston had been drinking, and breathalysed him - finding that he was over the limit, before arresting him and taking him away.

Laughing Mr Mehrban filmed an 80-second video of the incident in April last year on his mobile phone and posted it on Sunday on YouTube, where it has been viewed more than 5,000 times.

The clip shows Seston being spoken to by other officers, as Mr Mehrban says to one of them: ‘Can I have him arrested for drink-driving? I want him arrested for drink-driving.’

He then adds: ‘We have a police officer getting done for drink-driving outside Lane End, outside the community school. Is he arrested, yeah? He’s in the panda car getting arrested.’

Mr Mehrban, who had been pulled over by Seston on a routine stop, then goads the officer as he sits looking glum in a police van. He says: ‘Sorry mate, you shouldn’t have started on me, innit?’

Seston, of Watlington, Oxfordshire, a 
PCSO for eight years, was arrested by colleagues last April. He was 
later banned from driving after admitting drinking two bottles of red 
wine the day before.

Seston -
 who has since resigned from Thames Valley Police - was banned from 
driving for 12 months on May 17, after pleading guilty to drink-driving 
at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court.

Mr
 Mehrban today spoke of his shock at being pulled over. The father of 
two said: ‘I had just turned into my street after picking my son up from
 school, and this copper flagged me down.

‘He
 asked me to get out of the car, so I did because I was at home. I asked
 him why he stopped me, and he said he thought he could smell cannabis.

‘It
 was then I smelled his breath and I was like “whoa”. He stank of 
alcohol. I don't drink and I don't do drugs, so I started arguing with 
him because he was drunk.

‘It
 was then that he called for backup and I rang the police myself. When 
the other police turned up and arrested him, it was the absolute 
definition of justice.

Backup: When his colleagues arrived at the scene they suspected 44-year-old Seston had been drinking

‘He shouldn't be stopping people if he's drunk, and he definitely shouldn't have been driving.’

Car
 trader Mr Mehrban, 35, lives in Wycombe with his wife Tahira 
Yasmin, 30, and their two children. The incident happened yards from 
their family home, on a street outside Lane End Primary School.

PCSO
 Seston, who was stationed outside the school in a silver marked police 
car, began speaking to Mr Mehrban through his car window, before asking 
him to step out of the car.

Mr Mehrban said: ‘It was only when I 
got out of the car that I could smell alcohol on his breath. He was 
slurring his words and was a bit unsteady on his feet.

‘He
 called for backup and I rang 999 and told them one of their officers 
was drunk.’ Mr Mehrban only began filming when a police car and a van 
arrived.

He added: ‘At first
 the other officers were only interested in me, they checked my 
insurance and tried to see if they could smell cannabis on me. But they 
talked to him for a bit and then they realised he was drunk.

‘They breathalysed him and put him into the back of a van. I gloated a bit, but I think I deserved to. He was trying to make my day miserable, and got what was coming to him.’

A
 spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: ‘Andrew Seston is no longer 
employed by Thames Valley Police - and so as he is not an employee, we 
would not comment.’

Thames 
Valley PCSOs are paid employees who work with neighbourhood teams to 
patrol crime and anti-social behaviour hotspots, and assist police 
officers with crime enquiries.
