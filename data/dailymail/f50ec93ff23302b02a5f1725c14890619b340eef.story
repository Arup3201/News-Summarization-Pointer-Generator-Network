Former Hearts, Hibs and Manchester United midfielder Michael Stewart has announced his bid to become an MP.

The 33-year-old, a regular BBC Scotland pundit, has been nominated to pursue a position as an SNP candidate in Edinburgh West in May’s General Election.

He is expected to be selected to run from a list of nominated members next week.

Michael Stewart, who played for Hearts for three years between 2007 and 2010, is to stand as an MP

Steward was a member of the Yes campaign during the referendum this year, and will represent the SNP

The former Hearts captain, who was an active member of the Yes campaign during the referendum, told The Sun newspaper: ‘These are exciting times in Scotland. I don’t want to stand on the sidelines. 2014 was a year like no other and 2015 looks to be as exciting and important.

‘It was a privilege to be part of the Yes campaign. Like so many others I was inspired to play my small part in the democratic process, to try and make a difference for Scotland.

‘The spirit of the referendum continues not least in the SNP which grows from strength to strength under Nicola Sturgeon’s leadership.’

He added: ‘I hope my decision shows that people from any walk of life, including those with no previous career in politics, can become involved.’

The former midfielder started his career at Manchester United where he made a handful of first team starts
