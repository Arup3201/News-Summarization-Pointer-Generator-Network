A university has been stripped of its right to admit foreign students in a move that could have serious implications for other institutions.

London Metropolitan University was condemned as ‘very seriously deficient’ at ensuring its international students do not become illegal immigrants.

Up to 2,600 students could face deportation unless they can find another British university to accept them.

Demonstration: Foreign students from London's Metropolitan University protest outside downing Street after being told they face deportation due a to a new Government ruling that revokes the sponsorship of their visas

Silenced: Protesters taped their mouths shut to apparently symbolise losing their right to learn in Britain

Gathering: The students protest outside Downing Street gates were eventually moved by police

The decision has rocked universities 
that recruit substantial numbers of overseas students. They will 
scrutinise the UK Border Agency’s findings for possible implications for
 their own practices.

While London Met is the first 
publicly-funded university to lose its licence to sponsor non-EU 
students, two others – Glasgow Caledonian and Teesside –  have already 
had their licences suspended but then restored.

Several other universities have sought legal advice amid fears their licences could also be at risk.

An investigation by the UKBA checked a
 sample of London Met’s overseas students and found a quarter did not 
have permission to stay in the country.

In more than half of cases, there was 
no proof they were turning up to lectures. In 40 per cent of cases, 
there was evidence students’ English had not been properly tested.

Outrage:  Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz, left, slammed the decision by Immigration Minister to strip London Metropolitan University of its right to sponsor visas by saying it would damage Britain's reputation

Probe: London Metropolitan University had its Highly Trusted Status revoked after a damning Government study suggested few were attending lectures, many had a poor grasp of English and a quarter should did not have valid visas

Future in limbo: The university said the implications of the revocation were 'significant and far-reaching' and that their priority was the students and their obligations to them

It is unclear how many of London Met’s
 2,600 non-EU students are genuine and how many bogus.

The UKBA 
concluded the university’s procedures are not good enough to say either 
way.

The university’s highly-trusted status
 for sponsoring non-EU students was suspended last month while the UKBA 
carried out an investigation.

Keith Vaz, Chairman of the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee

The institution learned this week that
 the status had been formally revoked.

Immigration Minister Damian Green
 said: ‘Allowing London Met to continue to sponsor and teach 
international students was not an option.’

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the university was ‘very seriously deficient as a sponsor’.

Mr Green added: ‘What we found here is
 a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn’t
 have the capacity to be a proper sponsor and to have confidence that 
the students coming have the right to be here.’

Anger: Professor Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, left, and National Union of Students leader Liam Burns both critcised the 'heavy-handed' decision

It emerged last night that the 60-day 
deadline for students to find an alternative course or leave will not be
 imposed immediately.

It may be weeks before legal notices to leave are 
sent out to give genuine students more time to relocate.

The loss of its overseas students will
 create a huge financial headache for London Met, which saw 15 per cent 
of its £157.8million income in 2010/11 come from foreign student fees.

It was formed in 2002 when London 
Guildhall merged with the University of North London.

Max Watson, 
Unison’s branch chairman at the university, said some staff feared that a
 ban on taking non-EU students could lead to its demise.

There was an angry backlash over the 
UKBA’s move amid claims genuine overseas students would be put off 
coming to Britain, damaging our economy.

Sir Christopher Snowden, 
vice-president of Universities UK, said: ‘The London Met situation is 
very serious, not only for that university, but for the whole UK sector.

‘This situation could be interpreted 
very adversely by international students, their sponsoring organisations
 and potential students considering study in the UK.

‘UK universities contribute over 
£8billion to the UK economy through their education of international 
students and this type of incident certainly threatens that important 
contribution to the economy.’

The Higher Education Funding Council said:
 ‘UKBA’s decision does not in any way reflect concern about licensing 
arrangements at other universities in the UK.’

Professor Malcolm Gillies, the 
university’s vice-chancellor, described the claims made against the 
institution as ‘not particularly cogent’ and said it would be disputing 
them.

‘I would go so far as to say that UKBA has been rewriting its own 
guidelines on this issue,’ he added.

Facing fury: The National Voice for Students group contacted 
Prime Minister David Cameron, right, and Home Secretary Theresa May to 
reiterate that their decisions on higher education could have 
'catastrophic effects'
