A scandal-hit ambulance service has been criticised for spending nearly £250,000 on PR staff to defend its reputation.

Dozens of patients have died in 'unexpected or avoidable' circumstances while being attended to by the East of England Ambulance Service.

But last year, the trust spent £5,000 a week on five members of staff in its PR department, whose job is to respond to criticism and promote the service's image.

The EEAST covers a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.

It has been accused of poor performance, which may have contributed to patients' deaths, while a report this year found that its response times were unacceptably slow.

The trust spent a total of £247,406 on staffing its PR operations, a sum which local MP Dan Poulter, who is also a GP, described as 'extraordinary'.

'What is particularly distressing about this is that the East of England Service has a track record of failing to invest in the right areas,' said Dr Poulter, MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich.

'£250,000 could pay for 10 paramedics working on the ground, so they need to have a serious re-think about how they spend their money.'

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, added: 'It's a ludicrous amount of money. What people want is an effective and efficient ambulance service - not a highly-paid communications team spinning the news.'

A spokesman for the EEAST said: 'The communications team has already been reduced by more than £50,000 which will be put into front-line services and we are reviewing all of our support services.

'The communication team provide a vital reference point for patients, stakeholders and the media, raising awareness of the work of the ambulance service.'

Earlier this year, NHS figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 'serious incidents' since April 2010.

Of those, 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths.

After the trust was publicly criticised by MPs at a Parliamentary hearing, five non-executive directors resigned and new plans to improve the service were put into place.

A report in January concluded that the service had got better in some ways, but ruled that its response times were still unacceptably poor.

Chief executive Anthony Marsh, who was hired in December, this week announced that more ambulances would be introduced and resources shifted from the back office to frontline services.

The trust's total budget came to £226million during the fiscal year 2012/13.

Tragic: Peter Nelson died from a brain haemorrhage as his parents waited for an ambulance

Peter Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home.

In
 November, the 26-year-old collapsed in his bathroom in the village of 
Blakeney in Norfolk, after returning from a shift at a local hotel with a
 headache.

Mr Nelson's 
parents watched as his condition deteriorated, culminating in him 
coughing up blood and collapsing on the bathroom floor.

They dialled 
999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate.

By the time he arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save his life.

In September, the East of England Ambulance Trust was branded chaotic by a coroner investigating the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings.

Bella stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived.

Coroner
 William Armstrong branded the waiting time of 26 minutes - more than 
three times longer than national targets dictate - ‘wholly 
indefensible'.

The inquest 
at Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how an emergency first response car 
struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not 
up-to-date and 'there were too many blue doors'.

In June, an inquiry was opened after a 14-year-old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address.

Paramedics were called when Elouise Keeling, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets meeting at an RAF base.

But a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away.

By
 the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location, crews were
 unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.
