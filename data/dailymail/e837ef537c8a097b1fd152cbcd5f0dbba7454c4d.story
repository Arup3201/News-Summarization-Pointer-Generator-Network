These images look like incredible paintings - but in fact they are close-ups of water from a mountain stream which runs over the earth's minerals.

The thin layer of film full of minerals sits on top of the slow moving stream as the water mixes with deposits from the ground.

And the result is an amazing array of colors.

The close-ups of water from a Rocky Mountain stream which runs over the earth’s minerals show an incredible array of colors

The colorful water, which emerges from mountain springs, is created by a natural process and occurs in areas of abundant minerals

Photographer Steve Adams, 66, spotted the water in the Colorado Rockies near Grant - just 50 miles south west of the state capital Denver.

The former construction project manager was out shooting waterfalls, cascades and streams when he spotted one had an unusual colour.

He said: 'Colorado is known for its mining of minerals, particularly gold and silver.

'The minerals lay dormant until the spring run-off and the water fills the ground like a sponge.

'Once filled, the ground water then oozes out of the dirt banks and picks up minerals from the dirt.

Steve Adams explained that the state of Colorado is known for its mining of minerals, particularly gold and silver

The minerals that create the incredible colors lay dormant in the earth until the spring run-off and the water fills the ground like a sponge

'There are hundreds of these minerals in the mountains - in addition to silver and gold there is uranium, radon, radium, sulphates, lead, copper and molybdenum.'

The contaminated water, which emerges from mountain springs, is a natural process in areas of abundant minerals.

However, the incredible colors can take weeks to form as rain water can wash it all away in seconds.

Steve, from Conifer, Colorado, added: 'Photographers like to shoot unusual, beautiful, breathtaking scenes.

'When I discovered the minerals, my friend and I immediately stopped and focused on the minerals.

'They are difficult to shoot as so many variables come into play and some of the colors come from reflected light.

Thunderstorms, rain showers and hailstorms can destroy the minerals and it may take several dry days for the minerals to reform

Steve, from Conifer, Colorado, said that photographers like to shoot unusual, breathtaking scenes - and these streams are a perfect example

Steve said that when he discovered the minerals, he and his friends immediately stopped what they were doing and focused on them

'Thunderstorms, rain showers and hailstorms destroy the minerals and it could take several dry days for the minerals to reform.

'The minerals are a really a fragile layer of film merging with slow moving water.

'But pure and simple they took my breath away as the colors and designs were unlike anything I had seen before.'

The minerals that create the breathtaking colors are a really a fragile layer of film merging with slow moving water, Steve explained

The Rockies in Colorado contain a rich array of minerals within its wilderness of mountains, lakes and valleys

Steve said that 'pure and simple they took my breath away as the colors and designs were unlike anything I had seen before'

The minerals on the water 'are difficult to shoot as so many variables come into play and some of the colors come from reflected light'
