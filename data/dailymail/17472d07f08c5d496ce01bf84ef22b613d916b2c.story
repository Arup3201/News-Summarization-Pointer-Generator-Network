A report detailing whether the man who led the hunt for schoolgirl Milly 
Dowler’s phone turned a blind eye to News of the World reporters hacking her phone could be published almost two years later than expected, it has emerged.

There is speculation the Independent Police Complaints Commission's findings on Craig Denholm will not be made public until 2014 to avoid prejudicing criminal trials next year.

If delayed, Surrey's current deputy chief constable could retire before the IPCC's verdict is published on up to £85,000 per year.

Did he know? Surrey's deputy chief constable Craig Denholm (left) has been accused of knowing Milly Dowler's phone was hacked but a probe into it may not be made public until 2014 to avoid prejudicing criminal trials

He started his career started in 1984 and officers can leave their jobs after 30 years, with Mr Denholm likely to take home up to two-thirds of his £128,000 annual salary for the rest of his life.

Surrey Police has already admitted it knew for nine years before it became public that Milly's voicemail had been hacked while she was still missing, but never told Scotland Yard when they ran their first phone hacking investigation in 2006.

The
now defunct News of the World admitted hacking the 13-year-old’s mobile
phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted 
deliberately, as previously suggested, or were removed from her message 
box automatically.

Tributes: Craig Denholm (left) stands with Bob and Sally Dowler, Milly's parents, who said because her voicemail messages disappeared they believed she was alive - in fact her her phone had been hacked

The 
Leveson Inquiry into press standards has heard that Milly’s mother Sally
phoned her daughter repeatedly in March 2002 after she vanished while 
walking home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

The
teenager’s voicemail message was a generic automated response when her 
message box was full but when a message had been deleted the greeting 
reverted to her personal greeting.

The
Dowlers told the inquiry they were given ‘false hope’ by hearing the 
change of greeting - thinking their daughter might still be alive and 
had wiped a message.

In fact she had been abducted and murdered by triple-killer Levi Bellfield.

Probe: Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm,

accused of turning a blind eye to claims News of the World reporters 
hacked Milly Dowler's phone

Tragic: Milly was a schoolgirl from Walton-on-Thames, shown here ironing in video released by her her family, whose murder shocked Britain

The IPCC's report will reveal whether
Mr Denholm or his colleague temporary Detective Superintendent Maria 
Woodall, who took over as senior investigating officer in 2006, had 
turned a blind eye to it.

Surrey Police themselves reported them to the IPCC but they are still on active duty for the force.

'If Surrey Police had 
prosecuted this activity in 2002 then the position would have been very 
different. Perhaps countless others might also have avoided having their
private messages hacked into,' the Dowler family said in a statement earlier this year.

Mark
Lewis, the Dowler family’s lawyer, said: ‘The Dowler family welcomes 
the proper investigation of what happened at Surrey Police 10 years ago.

‘They regret that the passage of time means that some individuals can now no longer be investigated.'

The IPCC has told MailOnline that they still plan to hand their report over to Surrey's Chief Constable, Lynne Owens, 
before the end of the year, but the Independent claims that it is unlikely that it will be made 
public until 2014 - 18 months more than expected.

'The investigation is nearing completion and the investigation report is being finalised. Regarding the impact on the trials, we are currently assessing what information we will be in a position to put into the public domain. We would anticipate having the final investigation report with Surrey Police in advance of December.‬'
