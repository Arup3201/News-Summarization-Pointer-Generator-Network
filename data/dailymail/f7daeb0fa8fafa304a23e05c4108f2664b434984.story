A schoolgirl is lucky to be alive after being hit by a car then dragged along the road under a bus in a horrifying incident captured on CCTV.

The 12-year-old, who cannot be named, was left with a fractured skull and broken collarbone as she rushed to cross Rochester Road in Gravesend, Kent.

But incredibly police say she is awake and talking, but must spend a few more weeks recovering in Kings College Hospital in London.

Safety campaigners say the video should 
serve as a warning to others, as the girl ran across traffic through a 
gap between parked cars.

Frightening: In the top left of the screen the schoolgirl is seen sprinting across the road in front of a car

Strike: The student's blurred body is shown as it is hit by the vehicle and thrown up into the air

Tossed: A split-second later she is then thrown sideways into the road towards oncoming traffic

Horror: Moments later a bus drives into the picture and the schoolgirl goes under its wheels

The video was from a local business and released to the press, capturing her crossing Rochester Road in Gravesend towards a parade of shops when she was knocked into the path of the Arriva 480 bus during the busy school run.

A schoolboy is seen dashing out of K's Convenience Store, where the footage is shot, and desperately trying to find the girl who became wedged under the bus and dragged along for about five metres.

Emergency services were called to Rochester Road - between Empress Road and Old Road East - at 8.15am last Wednesday.

Firefighters used air bags to release 
the young girl before she was rushed to casualty.

Journey: Before the bus driver can stop he drives on and the girl's frame can be seen clearly under its front wheels

Scene: A boy runs out of a shop and peers under the bus looking for the girl who remains under its wheels and her school bag lies on the road now behind the vehicle

Remarkable: Motorists stopped their cars and got out to help and luckily the child survived - but safety campaigners have warned people to cross safely

Kevin Clinton, head of road safety for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'In very busy areas like this, it is really important for everyone to be concentrating and to be patient. Pedestrians should take their time and find a safe place to cross the road.

'It is even more important for drivers to be aware that pedestrians, especially children, may well make mistakes and drivers need to anticipate that and in particular, watch their speed.'

The Green Cross Code says: 'Try to avoid crossing between parked cars. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you clearly.'

Kent Police officers shut Rochester Road Milton Road and East Milton Road at the junction with Rochester Road.

Anyone with information is asked to call the serious collision investigation unit on 01622 798538 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
