Every child dreams of living in a magical land, complete with dragons and castles, as well as their favorite fairytale characters.

And now those childhood dreams could become a reality - at the bargain price of just $2.7million (£1.74million). 

The Enchanted Forest, in British Columbia, not only boasts 38.1 acres of beautiful woodland, but also a host of colorful characters to keep its new owners company - from Captain Hook and Snow White, to Humpty Dumpty and the Pied Piper.

Magic: The Enchanted Forest theme park in Calgary, British Columbia, is on sale for a bargain $2.7million

Attraction: Up to 1,000 visitors a day are said the flock to the park - which was lovingly created over 10 years more than 70 years ago

Neighbors: The forest has been filled with a host of magical characters to keep the new owner company during the quieter periods

Properties: It also boasts a host of different homes for the new owner to explore - including this one, the home of the Three Bears

The new owner will also get their pick of the properties, from the Three Bears' cozy cottage, to their very own castle - although they may have to watch out for the dragon peeking over the battlements.

They'll also be the proud holder of British Columbia's tallest treehouse, which soars 50 feet into the sky.

And if it is peace and quiet they seek, they can certainly find plenty of that in the forest: the nearest major town is Calgary, 275 miles away.

However, if magic isn't quite your cup of tea,  the property also boasts a high-rope assault course, mile-long nature trail and lake.

Record breaking: The park also has the tallest treehouse in the whole of British Columbia, soaring 50 feet into the sky

Hard work: The figurines dotted around the forest were lovingly created by the park's first owner, Doris Needham

Enchanting: Doris was an artist in the 1950s who wanted the perfect space to place the figurines - and settled on the forest

For sale: It was bought in 1990 by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers, who have now decided it is time to retire

Continue: But Rocky has said he very much hopes the new owners will continue to run the much-loved park as a tourist attraction

The Enchanted Forest was opened as a theme park in the 1960s after 10 years of hard work by Doris and Ernest Needham, who lived in their very own Candy Cane House.

Indeed, it was Doris' own artistic talent which helped create the 350 figurines scattered about the neighborhood. She searched for the perfect location for her unusual figurines for two years, before settling on this space in the Cedar Mountains.

Since 1990, however, the popular attraction has been owned by Rocky and Juliet Ehlers.

The couple, having lovingly run the forest as a theme park for 25 years, have now decided to hang up their ruby slippers for good, and enjoy a quieter retirement.

Interest: There is already a lot of interest in buying the property - with inquiries flooding in from all over the world 

Bargain: The theme park is far cheaper than Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to fetch $85million last year

Bright: It is also a bargain when compared to the cost of flats in some of the most expensive cities in the world

Rocky, 69, told the Revelstoke Times Review:  'It's been very enjoyable years and it's time we move on.'

He remains hopeful whoever buys the Enchanted Forest - which can still attract up to 1,000 visitors a day - will keep running it as a theme park. 

Estate agent Steve Daschuk said: 'This is such a magical property. So far we've had interest from all over Canada and internationally.

'We've even had people get in touch from China, enquiring about the forest.'

And that is perhaps not surprising: the theme park's asking price is a snip of that sought for Michael Jackson's Neverland, which was expected to get as much as $85million when it went on sale last year.

It is also just a million dollars more than the average flat price in Manhattan, the same price as a two-bedroom flat in central London and Hong Kong. 

Dragons: Estate agent Steve Daschuk described it as 'such a magical property', and said people from China had expressed interest

Remote: The nearest large town is Calgary - which is 275 miles away from the Enchanted Forest
