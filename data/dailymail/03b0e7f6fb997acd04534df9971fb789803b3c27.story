A woman whose face was battered by her boyfriend has been refused NHS funding for an operation to repair the damage.

Rebecca Beattie, 25, says she is struggling to breathe through her nose because of her injuries and has been told she needs corrective and cosmetic surgery.

But she has been denied treatment by the Health Service and is now trying to raise £5,500 for a private operation.

Rebecca Beattie, who was left barely able to breathe after being viciously beaten by her ex-boyfriend, has been refused NHS funding for surgery to repair her battered nose

Ms Beattie's ex-boyfriend, Bradley Scot Want (pictured),  was jailed for 16 months following the attack. She now needs corrective surgery but has been turned down for funding by the NHS

Miss Beattie, who has a son of four, 
suffered horrific injuries when Bradley Want attacked her at their home 
last April. She was left with splayed nasal bones, fractures and a 
grossly deviated septum.

Want, 24, was jailed for 16 months last September after admitting charges of assault and actual bodily harm.

After the case at York Crown Court, 
Miss Beattie said: ‘I will never forget what went through my mind that 
night, it was one of the worst feelings I’ve had, and ever will have.

‘I thought “He’s going to kill me, I’m never going to see my son again” – a feeling no parent should have to experience.’

Miss Beattie, who does voluntary work 
for a domestic abuse charity, is furious the local NHS trust panel 
turned her down and her Labour MP Hugh Bayley has taken up the case.

She said she cannot breathe through her right nostril and can barely breathe through the left, making sleep difficult.

‘It’s really difficult for me to 
breathe out of my nose. It’s a nightmare if I get a cold because I 
struggle to blow my nose,’ she said.

‘The surgery I need is corrective and 
cosmetic to try to fix it both inside and outside. I feel the NHS’s 
decision is shocking – it wasn’t my fault I received these injuries.

‘It’s not just the physical damage. 
Every time I look in the mirror, I have a constant reminder of what I 
had to endure.

'I want to move on and this is the last thing holding me 
back.’

She cited the case of glamour model Josie Cunningham, 22, who had
her breasts enlarged on the NHS at a cost of £4,800 after persuading 
doctors her flat chest was ruining her life and causing her emotional 
distress.

Last month it emerged that an aspiring glamour model had her breasts enlarged to size 36DD on the NHS. The surgery to 22-year-old Josie Cunningham, to take her from an A cup (right) cost taxpayers £4,800

The operation on the unmarried 
mother-of-two was approved by a primary care trust in Leeds – 20 miles 
from Miss Beattie’s home in York.

Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect a person’s health’.

Miss Beattie said: ‘They say I’m not 
an exception. I don’t meet the criteria, but apparently breasts do if 
you want to make money from glamour modelling. The surgeon couldn’t 
believe I have not got it.’

Miss Beattie applied for funding a few months ago and has had four rejection letters.

She is taking legal advice and has gone public to highlight the postcode lottery over NHS operations.

A GP-led Vale of York clinical 
commissioning group replaced the NHS North Yorkshire and York Primary 
Care Trust this month – and inherited its £19million financial deficit. 
The trust was criticised by doctors last year for spending £3.2million 
on home medical monitors that were barely used.

A spokesman for Vale of York CCG said 
it was working to understand the details of Miss Beattie’s case. The 
rejection letters said her condition was a low priority operation that 
was not ‘routinely commissioned unless exceptional clinical needs can be
demonstrated’.

Mr Bayley said he had lobbied for extra funding from the Health Secretary and had raised the case personally with the trust.
