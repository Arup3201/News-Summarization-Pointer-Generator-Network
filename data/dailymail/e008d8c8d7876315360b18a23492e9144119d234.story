Americans are becoming increasingly alienated from the political system with most believing that the government can't do anything to improve their lives, a new study has revealed.

In a survey conducted by EMC Research, two-thirds said they believe that they have no say in what happens in government with 73 per cent of those who responded saying they do not believe the government rules with the consent of the people.

The research will come as a blow to the current government after another poll earlier this week rated President Barack Obama as the worst U.S. leader since World War Two.

69 per cent of American voters believe the country is on the wrong track

The new survey asked those taking part about their levels of trust in the government and how optimistic they were about the future of America.

However, 69 per cent of respondents believed the country is on the 'wrong track' and remain negative about the direction of the country.

In addition 71 per cent also responded saying that they believe future generations will not have a better standard of life than current Americans.

And more worryingly the survey showed that 84 per cent of people felt alienated from the political system.

More than 40 per cent of respondents also described themselves as sad about the state of America's political system and economy with a further 65 per cent believing that politicians are now lying more and undermining democracy.

Meanwhile 59 per cent say that America would be better off all together if all elected officials in Washington were removed in favour of ordinary citizens.

This is supported by 92 per cent of people saying they prefer ordinary citizens rather than hand-picked elites running for office.

The poll has been commissioned by Patrick Caddell, who with a team has launched the website We Need Smith, which describes itself as a new movement to support ordinary citizens to take on America's political elites.

Involved in the launch is Bob Perkins, a former senior official with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who explained that today, July 4 was the best time to launch the campaign.

He said: 'While the political elites have purposely divided our nation, the Fourth of July reminds us how we united to seize our own future from the British.

'Similarly, We Need Smith aims to unite, showing Americans that they aren’t alone in their frustrations.  No single issue has united all voters like this reform platform.'

Earlier this week, a third of Americans singled-out Mr Obama as their least favourite president since 1945 in Quinnipiac University's latest presidential poll, just ahead of George W. Bush, who received 28 percent of the vote.

His favorability ratings were underwater in nearly every issue area the poll asked voters about except the environment.

The president scored below 50 percent on healthcare, the economy, terrorism and foreign policy.

Voters go to the ballot box in four months to elect a new Congress.

Generic congressional polls taken in the last several weeks put Democrats slightly ahead, but still within the margin of error.

Republicans are likely to keep the House, but the Senate, which is currently controlled by the president's party, could go either way.
