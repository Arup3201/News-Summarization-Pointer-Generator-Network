A 13-year-old boy was arrested on Saturday for allegedly fatally stabbing a 14-year-old boy with scissors outside of a Los Angeles middle school on Friday.

Steven Cruz, a student at James A. Garfield Senior High School, was stabbed at a neighboring school in what officials and witnesses say may have been a gang related incident.

The youngster was standing by the school's fence as classes were let out at the end of the day when the suspect allegedly approached him, asked him where he was from and stabbed him in the torso.

The boy accused of killing him was picked up by police from his Los Anegles home at 1:30am and then transported to an East L.A. sheriff’s station where he was booked for murder.

Dead: Steven Cruz, 14, was fatally stabbed outside of David Wark Griffith Junior High School in Los Angeles in what police and witnesses are saying may have been a gang-related attack

Tribute: Flowers surrounded a picture of the schoolboy as residents mourned his death on Saturday. A 13-year-old bpy was arrested and charged with murder at his Los Angeles home 

Cruz was at the neighboring middle school David Wark Griffith Junior High School for unknown reasons.

'Somebody's been stabbed,' yelled a frantic witness at around 3 p.m. on Friday.

The LA Times reports that the witness saw the 'severely injured' Cruz trying to climb the stairs calling for help.

KTLA reports that when the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department arrived at the middle school they found Cruz with a stab wound to his torso.

'While the victim was on campus, the suspect approached the victim, stabbed him in the chest, and fled the scene south on Fetterly Avenue,' said a statement from the LASD. 

He was transported to a local hospital where he died of his injuries.

According to news release by the LASD the suspect was seen on foot running down a nearby avenue. 

The scene: Over a dozen cop cars congregate outside of David Wark Griffith Junior High School where the victim was brutally stabbed 

Investigation: An investigation is underway after a 14-year-old student was stabbed to death with a sharp object outside Griffith School

Lt. Holly Francisco of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that there appeared to be no quarrel before the stabbing.

'The investigators are just doing interviews now, but we don’t have any indication that there was a fight prior to the stabbing,' Francisco said.

'It appears to be an isolated incident.'

Some witnesses question whether or not the incident was gang related based on where either victim was from.

The stabbing occurred as students were being let out but around 100 students who remained on the campus for after-school programs were on lock-down for hours as officers searched for the suspect.

Concerned parents and students gathered outside the school to pick up their children.

The LA Times spoke with troubled mother Edith Torres who waited outside the school for hours so she could take her young daughter home.

'You never know, you’re thinking that your kids are safe and the last thing that you expect is for this to happen,' Torres said.

Random attack: Police do not believe a quarrel occurred before the victim was attacked and others believe that the incident may have been gang related
