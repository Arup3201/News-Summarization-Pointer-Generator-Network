A Stockholm man who watched a late night reveller fall onto railway tracks leapt to his side minutes before a train arrived. But not to help – to empty his pockets.

Closed circuit TV picked up the images as minutes later a train arrived and ran over the comatose stranger. Miraculously new father 'Johnny', 38, survived.

Chillingly, the perpetrator passed a guard on the way out of the station without telling him that there was a helpless man on the tracks.

Callous: CCTV shows the man peering down at his victim whom he had already tried to pickpocket earlier. The victim had knocked himself unconscious in the fall from the platform

'He had at least six minutes to sound the alarm. If he had told the guard then he would have had time to stop the train,' said inspector Dan Osenan of the south Stockholm police.

'It makes you want to be sick. It doesn’t matter that this was a 38 year old man. This could have been a child and someone like this doesn’t give a damn.'

Swedish police have been tracking the railway robber since last month when they believe he followed a drunk man from a train and emptied his pockets on the platform.

Thief: Rather than helping the drunk man, named Johnny, he climbs down to the tracks and rifles through his pockets

Chilling: He then makes off, leaving the man to die. Chillingly, the perpetrator passed a guard on the way out of the station without telling him that there was a helpless man on the tracks

On Saturday night at 3.30am, the thief can be seen following a clearly drunk Johnny off a train and attempting to rifle through his pockets as he takes a rest on a platform bench.

Agitated, Johnny gets up and walks down the platform before falling to the tracks and knocking himself unconscious.

Ten minutes after being left to die, the front five metres of an oncoming train can be seen crushing the prone figure. Johnny has lost half his left foot and will need a prosthetic knee.

Danger: Ten minutes after being left to die, the front five metres of an oncoming train can be seen crushing the prone figure. Johnny has lost half his left foot and will need a prosthetic knee, but was otherwise unharmed

'The man didn’t knock him onto the tracks so we can only prosecute him for the theft,' said Osenan. 'Unfortunately, leaving someone to die is not a crime in Sweden.

'But I hope the court will take this very very seriously.'

The footage will be shown on TV3’s Wanted programme tonight which cops believe will lead to a quick identification and arrest.
