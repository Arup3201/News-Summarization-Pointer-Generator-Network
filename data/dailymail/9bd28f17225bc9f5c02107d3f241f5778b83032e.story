A woman in West Australia has been fined $5000 and banned from having contact with any animal for 10 years after her dog was found close to death due to being severely neglected.

In October the RSPCA received a complaint about a skinny Collie cross dog called Milly who was seen in her front yard frothing from the mouth.

A City of Kalgoorlie/Boulder Ranger took the dog to a local vet hospital where Milly was found to be suffering from multiple conditions including maggots in her anus, deeply sunken eyes, pale gums, a weak pulse and rapid respiration.

Local residents in Kalgoorlie found Milly the Collie cross dog in a terrible state in her front yard frothing from the mouth in October

On Monday the dog's owner Janine Helen Giblin appeared in Kalgoorlie Magistrates court and was ordered to pay $1000 in addition to her fine, after it was revealed she hadn't taken her dog to the vet for over a decade.

Milly was originally spotted by local residents in Boulder in Kalgoorlie lying in the sun without shade or water trying to drag herself towards a bucket of water a metre away.

The caller who contacted the RSPCA said the dog was also emanating little barks that sounded like cries, and that there was food scattered around the yard but it was covered in flies.

Photographs and video were taken of Milly by members of the public before one took the sick puppy to their home and awaited assistance.

Milly is said to have had a terrible stench, was unresponsive to noise or movement and would not respond when people tried to give her water through a syringe.

The dog was then taken to a local vet and during examination, Milly lifted her head but collapsed.

The veterinarian made the decision to euthanase her on humane grounds, saying she was in severe pain and had been neglected over a long period of time.

'There is no excuse for letting a dog just rot away like this,' RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said.

When she was discovered, Milly (not pictured) had maggots growing in her and was so ill she had to be euthanised
