Energy minister Greg Barker has been criticised for attending a Boxing Day hunt while thousands of families spent the day without power.

More than 300,000 homes have been affected and last night 1,132 properties in Kent, more than 225 in Surrey and nearly 400 in Sussex were still left in the dark.

But Greg Barker, who himself has been affected by the power cuts, sparked anger from the Labour opposition by turning out to support his local hunt in Battle, East Sussex, on Boxing Day.

Mr Barker also tweeted his support for the event saying: 'Great show of support in #Battle for local #Hunt Boxing Day Meet on Abbey Green. Largest crowd I've seen for year, #SupportCountrySports'

But Twitter users were quick to respond to the minster's comments.

One replied saying: 'The rest of the country is struggling with hunger, poverty and storms.

'Never mind, as long are you're having fun eh?'

The Conservative Party told The Daily Mirror that Mr Barker: 'Tweeted a message of support for his local Boxing Day hunt, but didn't actually go hunting himself.'

UK Power Networks, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south east and east of England, said it will almost triple its compensation for those affected by long-term power cuts.

The problems began when high winds struck many parts of England on Thursday night and thousands of families are still thought to be affected.

Director of customer services Matt Rudling said: 'This is such a difficult time of year for people to be without power and so many families have also been flooded out of their homes.

'Our hearts go out to our customers and we have been trying different ways to help them, from arranging Christmas dinners to providing more help and tools on our website.'

A spokesman added: 'As a gesture of goodwill UK Power Networks has decided to boost the industry standard payment from £27 to £75 for customers who are without power for 48-60 hours including Christmas Day, and additional payments will be made to any customers off supply for longer up to a maximum of £432.'
