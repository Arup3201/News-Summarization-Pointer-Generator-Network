The residents of Benefits Street want Channel 4 to film a second series of the show on their road - despite claiming they were 'manipulated' by the broadcaster.

They said a follow-up show should focus 
on the workers and pensioners living on the road - rather than just five
 main characters.

White Dee complained that Channel 4 spent 18 months filming everyone on James Turner Street, Birmingham, but then focused on just her and a few neighbours on the show.

New series? White Dee, seen hear with her arm round fellow James Turner Street resident Tich on last night's Channel 4 benefits debate, accused the broadcaster of painting a false picture of her life on handouts. However, her fellow residents in James Turner Street have called for a second series of the show to be filmed there

The broadcaster has already said they will be commissioning a second series but it will be filmed in another city altogether.

The programme, which has courted controversy, has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4 pulling in more than six million viewers.

However, White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - said that the broadcaster had made her life living on handouts look cushy.

During a live debate on Channel 4, she said: 'You spent up to 18 months, up to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit and boom (you showed)... five of us.'

She added: 'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack.

'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.'

But despite claims the residents had been manipulated, self-employed beautician Anna Korzen, 
28, said that she would be happy to welcome the show back.

'I would have no
 problem with them coming back for a second series I’m sure it would be a
 good thing for all of us,' she said.

'Every popular programme needs a second series.'

James Turner Street pensioner George Drummond, 82, also called for a return of the cameras to the road.

He
 said: 'I think people do need to see the the real side of the street, I
 would say at least 50 per cent of people in James Turner Street have 
jobs.

'A second show talking about how they live could go a long way to helping.

'If we could show the issues the real people face, rather than the five or six the show focused on, they would be very good.'

Factory
 worker Symphorien Mbuyama, 33, added: 'I think the people should come 
back and film here again, show the world what the street is really like.

'That show has done damage, so they should be making efforts to fix what they have caused.

'I would like to see them come back and show the positive things and make a positive difference to any problems.'

Benefits Street aspiring model 'SB' - real name Sherrell Dillion - warned against a second series of the show.

'I know there was a big controversy about the programme so for them to do a second series would be weird,' she said.

'A lot of people have got a lot of stick so I hope people know what they are getting themselves into.

'But they might want to do it for the fame or what might happen after the show.

'I think everybody should be careful, they didn’t even tell some people it was going to be called Benefits Street until the week before it started.'

Last week Love Productions revealed they are already planning a second series - but they were looking for potential locations outside of Birmingham.

A spokesman said: Love Productions are in development and researching potential new locations for a second series of Benefits Street.

'The first series ignited an important debate about the welfare system and we are interested in seeing if we can revisit this through the experiences of residents of a street in a different part of Britain.'

There have been more than 1,000 complaints about Benefits Street since it first aired.
