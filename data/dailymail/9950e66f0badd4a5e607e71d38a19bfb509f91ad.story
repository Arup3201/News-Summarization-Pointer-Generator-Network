Former HSBC boss Lord Green has quit as chairman of a financial services industry body amid claims the multi-national bank enabled tax dodging while he was in charge.

The Tory peer stepped down from his role as chairman of TheCityUK's advisory council with immediate effect, it has been announced.  

He took the decision days after it was revealed HSBC's Swiss office had thousands of 'black' accounts between 2005 and 2007, which were used to stash millions and avoid tax.

Quit: Lord Green has stepped down as chairman of TheCityUK amid claims HSBC enabled tax dodging while he was boss

Sir Gerry Grimstone, chairman of the organisation's board, said: 'Stephen Green is a man of great personal integrity who has given huge service to his country and the City.

'He doesn't want to damage the effectiveness of TheCityUK in promoting good governance and doing the right thing so has decided to step aside from chairing our Advisory Council. 

'This is entirely his own decision.'

Sir Gerry will take on Lord Green's role, alongside his current position. 

Lord Green, who was chairman of HSBC between 2006 and 2010, has been under increasing pressure to explain behaviour at the bank's Swiss arm since it was revealed earlier this week.

He is expected to be called before a Treasury Select Committee later this year, where he will be questioned about what he knew while in charge at HSBC.

Information leaked to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in 2010 identified 7,000 British clients, 1,100 of whom had not paid their taxes. 

The timing means the agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011.

But it transpires HMRC was only asked to vet his personal tax arrangements before his appointment.

Facilitating: It is alleged the bank had thousands of 'black' accounts hidden in Switzerland, hiding millions from the taxman 

Downing Street initially said that neither Lord Green, who stepped down as a minister in 2013, nor any other member of the government, had 'any knowledge that HSBC may have been involved in wrongdoing' until it was reported in newspapers and by the BBC in recent days.

But the comments were at odds with claims by Treasury minister David Gauke, who told the Commons on Monday that information about HSBC had been 'in the public domain since 2007'.

Downing Street later said it had 'no record' that HMRC told ministers about apparent HSBC involvement in 'wrong-doing relating to its Swiss banking arm'. 

Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Treasury select committee that HMRC had not passed on details of the allegations before they appeared in the media.

HMRC chief executive Mrs Homer said the data was given to the tax authority under conditions which stopped it from sharing the information.

Anger over the situation was made worse by the fact that while some £135million in tax and penalties has since been recovered, only one prosecution has been brought.
