Chico Flores's preparations for the new season are well underway, as this video shows.

The Swansea defender is seen marching confidently down a diving board at an indoor swimming pool before overbalancing and falling off as he got ready to make his big entry into the watr.

Some might it is all part of the Spaniard's plan, given his emotional personality and theatric tendencies.

Ready: Swansea defender Chico Flores makes his way down the diving board confidently

Set: Flores prepares to dive but mis-steps and begins to tumble from the board

Going down: In a scene recognised by many in the Premier League, Flores emphatically falls down

Last season Flores made headlines after a training ground bust-up with Swansea manager Garry Monk, who was only in temporary charge at the time.

The player is said to have picked up a brick during the altercation which required police to be called, although they later put their differences behind them and moved on.

Flores also angered Sam Allardyce after the West Ham manager believed his exaggerated reaction had got Andy Carroll sent off during a Premier League game between the two clubs.

Allardyce said: 'Chico Flores is over-exaggerating, which is generally the norm for him unfortunately.'

Flores' future at Swansea is in doubt this summer with the club looking to sell him and sign Virgil van Dijk.

Controversial: Flores was involved in a number of unsavoury incidents last season

Exaggerated: West Ham felt his dramatic reaction to a clash with Andy Carroll got the striker sent off
