Tony Abbott has made yet another on-screen gaffe while being filmed during a radio interview on ABC this morning.

The PM was caught winking at radio host Jon Faine, who was off-camera, during an interview with a  67-year-old grandmother who told Mr Abbott she worked as a female sex line worker to 'make ends meet'.

She was calling to quiz the PM on his hard-lined stance on the budget, declaring she has been forced to work in the industry.

But a spokeswoman for Mr Abbott later told Fairfax Media the wink was to assure the presenter he was happy to proceed with the call, not a judgment of the caller.

Speaking on 774 ABC Melbourne, Gloria, from Warburton, challenged the PM over his government's tough-love budget.

'What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott? Food, electricity, firewood, Christmas, birthday presents to my grandchildren or should we all just die and get out of your way?" the grandmother asked.

She said she was 67, and had three chronic, incurable medical conditions. 'I just survive on around $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent.'

'I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. Now that's the only way I can do it.'

Mr Abbott responded by saying he understood she was doing it tough, pointing out he was getting rid of Labor's carbon tax but leaving the compensation in place.

Abbott's untimely gesture comes just hours after he snubbed a planned university visit this morning in Geelong.

Student protestors launched a verbal spray directed at the PM calling him 'cowardly' for cancelling the trip.

The AFP advised Mr Abbott and Education Minister Christopher Pyne against going, amid concerns for their safety.

The Prime Minister and Education Minister Christopher Pyne were due to visit Geelong's Deakin University campus, but the trip was cancelled amid concerns over a fiery student backlash to the recent budget announcement.

The pair were planning to attend the opening of the university's carbon fibre research facility, and it was to have coincided with a national day of student protests against the government's higher education reforms, including removing caps on fees universities can charge.

Instead, Mr Abbott will meet with Victorian Premier Denis Napthine today where he will answer to $80 billion worth of cuts to education and hospital funding announced in last week's budget.

Christopher Pyne told the ABC's Lateline that the AFP advised he and the Prime Minister that by visiting the university they were putting their safety at risk.

But national Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said Mr Abbott must start taking students serious and explain why he's worried about answering their questions.

'I think the prime minister and his ministers are being a bit cowardly and trying to portray students as though they're violent rabble-rousers who are out to cause trouble, which isn't the case at all,' she told AAP.

'They're trying to make us sound like spoiled little brats who don't know how good we've got it. They have a very clear agenda.'

Rowan Payne from the Deakin University student association and a member of the National Union of Students told ABC News Breakfast said the PM's snubbing proved that student voices were being heard.

'This budget represents the biggest changes to the tertiary education sector since the introduction of HECS,' he said.

He said it's understandable that students feel aggrieved at the measures taken by the Federal Government.

'The glory days of free education in this country have been slashed and it looks like things are only going to get worse.'
