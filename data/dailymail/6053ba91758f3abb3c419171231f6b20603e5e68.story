They might look like a cluster of microbes, or even pictures of distant galaxies.

But these black and white moving images reveal the inside of fruit and vegetables in a whole new way.

They were produced by a U.S. student using a magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, which is typically used by medical professionals for peering into the brain.

Tutti fruiti: A U.S. student has used a magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner to record cross sections of the inside of fruit, such as the pomegranate (pictured)

The specialist machines monitor brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow, but in this case were used to let people see inside popular fruits and vegetables in cross sections without using a knife to cut into them.

They include an image of broccoli that looks like a cosmic explosion or shower of confetti and mesmerising views of passion fruit and corn that show all the small seeds or kernels inside them.

Andy Ellison, an MRI technologist at Boston University Medical Centre for Biomedical Imaging has been making fruit and vegetables exciting since 2010 using his high tech kit.

Psychedelic: The edible banana flower (pictured) makes some crazy patterns when placed in an fMRI scanner

Since beginning his blog he has racked up around 65 sets of images of fruit, flowers and vegetables, from everyday staples like apples and tomatoes to unusual and exotic fruits such as a horned melon called kiwano and jackfruit – a large fruit with a textured skin that weighs around 22lbs (10kg).

The fruit used by Mr Ellison measured 18inches (46cm) in length and Mr Ellison wrote on his blog, Inside Insides, ‘I barely could fit it in any of my coils’.

Instead of scanning the entire fruit as usual, he had to slice sections off at either end to fit it in his fMRI scanner.

Exotic: The kiwano (pictured) belongs to the melon and cucumber family and is native to Africa. It looks a little bit like a microbe under the fMRI scanner

Confusing: Cereal grains such as corn (pictured) and 
rice are confusingly a type of fruit called a caryopsis but the fruit 
wall is incredibly thin and fused to the seed coat so almost the 
entirety of the edible grain is a seed

A fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant product associated with seeds, whereas a vegetable is any savoury plant product.

Vegetables that are actually fruit include cucurbits such as squashes and cucumbers as well as tomatoes, peas, beans, corn, aubergine and sweet pepper.

A taste of the tropics: As well as imaging everyday fruit and vegetables, Andy Ellison used his fMRI scanner to capture cross sections of more exotic fruit and eats, such as the banana flower (pictured left) and the kiwano (pictured right) an African fruit in the cucumber and melon family

Chillies are also fruits, while rhubarb, which is commonly referred to as a fruit, is botanically a vegetable.

Cereal grains such as wheat and rice are confusingly a type of fruit called a caryopsis but the fruit wall is incredibly thin and fused to the seed coat so almost the entirety of the edible grain is a seed.

Passionate: Since beginning his blog, Mr Ellison has racked up
 around 65 images of fruit, flowers and vegetables, including this passion fruit
