An Alabama High School has been forced to apologize for a 'blast thru' sign made by a group cheerleaders that recalled the Trail of Tears ethnic cleansing campaign.

The football banner, created by students at McAdory High School in McCalla for the second round of the state play-offs, was directed at their opponents, Pinson Valley High School, who use an Indians as their mascot.

The racially offensive sign read: 'Hey Indians, Get ready to leave in a trail of tears round 2.'

The Trail of Tears refers to the period around 1838 when the U.S. government forcibly removed thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homes in the southeast to what is now the state of Oklahoma, killing up to 6,000 in the process.

'I felt disrespected (and) hurt that we allowed our students, our youth, to participate in this,' said Brian Sappier, a board member with the Society of American Indian Government Employees, told WBRC.

'It shows racism does still exist.

McAdory High School Principal Tod Humphries said he didn't feel the sign was made with malicious intent.

But he apologized and took responsibility for any offense it caused.

He said all signs are usually checked over by the cheerleading coach, who was on maternity leave.

'I think they made a mistake of not checking the sign,' Humphries said.

The first time the sign was seen was on the field on Friday night, he said.

'Please accept our sincere apologies to 
the Native American people and to anyone who was offended by the 
reference to an event that is a stain on our Nation's past forever,' 
Humphries said in a statement.

McAdory High School claim there was no malicious intent involved in the sign and that the cheerleaders who created it had just used an 'Indians' pun they didn't realize was offensive

Jefferson County Superintendent Dr. Stephen Nowlin said in a statement on the school' website that 'the cheerleading squad will be disciplined'.

Nowlin also says in the statement that Humphries has asked the school's social studies teachers to teach a special unit on the Trail of Tears.

'We can use this unfortunate event as an important teachable moment,' he said.

'Our curriculum department will ensure that all students in the future will have a lesson on the Trail of Tears.'

The Trail of Tears largely forced Cherokees to uproot from lands in Georgia and North Carolina to Oklahoma on a path crossing parts of several states including Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas, according to the National Park Service.

It said many walked hundreds of miles while others were transported on wagons, steamboats and river flatboats.

McAdoryâ€™s football team defeated Pinson Valley 34-17 and will hit the road to face unbeaten Southside-Gadsden in a 5A state quarterfinal game Friday.
