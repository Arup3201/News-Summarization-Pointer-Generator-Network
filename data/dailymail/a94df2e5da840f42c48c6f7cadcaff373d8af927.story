Disaster tourists today flocked to Britains east coast to see for themselves the aftermath of the biggest tidal surge in six decades.

Curious bystanders today stood staring at beachside bungalows in Hemsby, Norfolk, which collapsed into the sea after the high tide obliterated the bluff on which they stood.

Hundreds of sightseers were walking on Hemsby beach, stopping to look and their there pictures taken with the houses that have all but fallen into the sea after their cliff-top perch disintegrated.

Fun for all the family: A policeman stands guard to warn people away from the still-unstable structures as a family with young children wanders along the sea front

Policemen and Environment Agency workers in hi-viz jackets stood by to warn curious onlookers against straying to close to the still unstable ruins.

Properties further inland fared little
better from the raging waters; they stood today with holes torn in 
their walls, windows shattered and contents strewn across still muddy 
streets.

Meanwhile, 
Environment Agency workers, backed up by an RAF Chinook helicopter, 
worked to patch up battered flood defences with sandbags.

And
the clean-up operation was still under way after 1,400 homes and 
businesses around Britain were flooded by the most serious tidal surge 
in 60 years on Thursday night.

Thankfully,
weather has remained calm in the communities worst affected by the 
flooding, with conditions largely dry despite cloudy skies.

A
rescue operation was also underway today to save scores of grey seal 
pups which were swept away from beaches by the surge tide last week.

The
National Trust confirmed that 263 pups were lost on Thursday night from
a major breeding colony at Horsey Gap near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Others
are also believed missing from the National Trust reserve at Blakeney 
Point in north Norfolk along with 20 from an offshore colony at Scroby 
Sands near Great Yarmouth.

Wildlife
volunteers said 190 of the pups have been washed up alive on nearby 
beaches, but there are fears that many might still die after being 
separated from their mothers in the raging seas.

Others have already drowned and bodies are turning up on beaches.

Royal Air Force Support Chinook Helicopter 
provides heavy lift support to place one-ton sandbags into a breach in 
the sea defence wall near Middlesbrough

The Royal Air Force Support Chinook was deployed to the North East with a six-man team from RAF Odiham's Joint Helicopter Support Squadron to support the Environment Agency as workers carry out repairs on the East Coast flood defences

And it emerged today that police had 
asked residents who refused to leave their homes in advance of the storm
were asked to sign disclaimers

The
forms stated that anyone who signed accepted that they were putting 
themselves at risk from sea water 'up to a depth of three metres' by 
staying in their homes.

A 
clause added that emergency services would be 'stretched to their 
capacity' in the event of flooding, meaning that people might not be 
able to be rescued until waters had subsided.

More
than 1,000 residents of Jaywick near Clacton, Essex, which was deemed 
to be at risk of serious flooding were asked to sign after they refused 
to be evacuated on Thursday.

Three-day forecast: Areas worst affected by the 
storm surge are expected to stay dry, with the odd ray of sunshine breaking through patchy cloud. Rain over Scotland and Northern 
Ireland will clear and temperatures across the country will be fairly 
mild, particularly in the South

The form, headed Evacuation Advice Leaflet, stated: 'If you decide to remain within your home, you should be aware that there is high risk your home will be flooded by sea water up to a depth of three metres.

'You also need to bear in mind that in the event of severe flooding, the electricity and gas supplies may be temporarily suspended.

'In the event you decided to remain within your home, you will be asked to sign the bottom of this notice to state that you understand the risks of remaining in your home at this time.

'If flooding does occur, then it is anticipated the emergency services will be stretched to their capacity and may not be able to undertake an emergency rescue until the flood water has subsided.'

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed that leaflets were handed out in Jaywick 'to make clear to residents the severity of the situation they were facing and the different options open to them'.

Biblical proportions: The Quay 
car park, at Morston, on the north Norfolk coast, on Friday morning, just hours after the storm surge struck the region's coastline

The North Sea surge hit the north Norfolk coast early Thursday evening and headed south throughout the night. It emerged today that police in Essex asked residents to sign waivers if they chose not to leave their homes after being warned of the imminent inundation

People make their way through the devastation at Cromer, in Norfolk, as debris lies across the promenade: The Environment Agency said beefed-up flood defences and timely flood warnings helped prevent even greater loss of life and property despite 'record-breaking' sea levels along the east coast

Other police forces in Suffolk, Norfolk and Kent which also advised residents of some low-lying areas to leave their homes, said they did not require them to sign forms. Instead officers only noted the names of residents to confirm that they had been given the advice.

Thousands of people have been left effectively homeless by the surging tide which struck the Norfolk coast on Thursday evening and swept south throughout the night.

It was inundation on a near-Biblical scale, with the 40 severe flood warnings, 134 flood warnings and 63 flood alerts in place by the following morning.

It claimed two lives, but the Environment Agency said beefed-up flood defences and timely flood warnings helped prevent even greater loss of life and property despite 'record-breaking' sea levels along the east coast.

An EA spokesman said: 'Over 2,800 kilometres of flood walls, banks and other flood risk management assets along the English coast and estuaries have protected more than 800,000 properties from flooding.

'Environment Agency teams and contractors will remain out on the ground over the coming days to inspect and repair damaged sections of walls, banks and other assets.

'These teams have received military support for the most urgent repairs.'
