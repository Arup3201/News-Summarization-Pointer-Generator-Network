Bill Maher poked fun at the allegations against NBC News anchor Brian Williams last night and joked Williams told such big lies that he's been offered a position to work at Fox News.

Maher's show which aired last night on HBO at 10pm shed a little humor on Brian William's heroic tales. 

'When we get older… we misplace our keys, we have trouble with people’s names, we can’t remember if the helicopter we were in crashed,' quipped the late night host saying he can sympathize with the mistakes of old age.

Williams made such a 'blatant departure from the truth, he got an offer from Fox News,' concluded Maher.

Former NBC late Night Host Conan O'Brien also made fun of Williams two nights ago saying he's tried to 'get in on someone's glory' more than once.

Conan showed manipulated video of Brian Williams saying he was responsible for the Miracle on the Hudson plane landing and climbed a giant rock - like Tom Cruise in 'Mission Impossible 2.'

NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claims that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism in the wake of his own admission on Wednesday that he lied about being aboard a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire during the Iraq war.

Despite a swift apology on his Nightly News program, Williams is at the center of a media firestorm after it emerged that his old war story that he has retold numerous times over the past 12 years has become increasingly exaggerated.

Williams was forced to apologize this week after claiming in a report on Friday that the chinook he was aboard in Iraq had been hit by enemy fire. 

On Wednesday Williams blamed his mistake on the 'fog of memory over 12 years', but evidence has emerged since that Williams has repeatedly mis-told the story including to late night host David Letterman in 2013.

NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism after he admitted to lying over an old Iraq war story

New Orleans' famous French Quarter escaped flooding during Hurricane Katrina as it is located on the highest part of the city 

The anchor's previous credibility as a highly regarded journalist is based partly on his reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.

The major story broke just months after Williams replaced Tom Brokaw as NBC News' anchor and his reporting from the devastation of New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award.

In the wake of the scandal over William's war story apology, attention is now turning to comments he made about what exactly he witnessed in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.

'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country...I beat that storm. I was there before it arrived. 

'I rode it out with people who later died in the Superdome,' he said in an interview in 2006, just a year after the hurricane.

The story was first broken by the GotNews.com news blog. 

Williams' reporting from New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his Iraq war story climb down 

According to the New Orleans Advocate, Williams claim isn't accurate as the French Quarter of the city – one of the highest parts of the city – was never flooded.

The Advocate has also taken Williams to task over another Katrina-related claim that he made in an interview last year with her predecessor Brokaw.

In the interview Williams claims that he had caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters during his stay in New Orleans.

'My week, two weeks there was not helped by the fact that I accidentally ingested some of the floodwater,' he said.

'I became very sick with dysentery, our hotel was overrun with gangs, I was rescued in the stairwell of a five-star hotel in New Orleans by a young police officer. We are friends to this day. And uh, it just was uh, I look back at total agony.'

Those claims have also had cold water poured on them.

The anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005

'I saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises and such, but I don't recall a single, solitary case of gastroenteritis during Katrina or in the whole month afterward,' Dr. Brobson Lutz, a former city health director told the Advocate.

A spokeswoman from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said contaminated water sources are a possible 'transmission points' for dysentery, but that the agency doesn't track it.

Elsewhere, conservative blog, SooperMexican, posted video clips on Thursday that apparently showed Williams telling two completely different stories about a New Orleans man who committed suicide during the Katrina.

One clip from the Brokaw interview has Williams claim that he personally witnessed the death, while in a second clip, Williams said he 'heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck' of the New Orleans Superdome.

In the same interview with Brokaw, he praised Williams, saying that with his reporting during Katrina, Williams 'took ownership, if you will, of the anchor chair' following a longtime stint as Brokaw's understudy. 

In a 2014 interview with Tom Brokaw, right, Williams claimed that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters in New Orleans - a claim that experts have said is highly unlikely

WHAT BRIAN WILLIAMS SAID 

Report from Iraq, March 2003

'On the ground we learn the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out of the sky.'

WHAT HAPPENED

The gunned-down Chinook was part of a separate squadron (159th Aviation, aka 'Big Windy') of three aircraft that flew out of Germany. 

It was hit by an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) an hour before the NBC crew landed.

WHAT BRIAN WILLIAMS SAID 

Interview, November 2005

'I guess the combat was three days under way when the helicopter I was flying on was shot at.'

WHAT HAPPENED 

Their mission was diverted due to a dust storm which made flying unsuitable. 

They landed next to a Chinook that had been shot at 60 minutes earlier.

Damage: The original report shows the damage suffered by the Chinook after it was shot at in 2003

WHAT BRIAN WILLIAMS SAID 

NBC blog post, September 2007

The 'chopper flying in front of ours' was hit by an RPG.

WHAT HAPPENED

As established, the chopper was not flying in front of theirs.

It was hit by two RPGs. One passed through the airframe and rotor blades and did not detonate. It was also hit by shots from a rifle or light-machine gun.

WHAT BRIAN WILLIAMS SAID 

NBC blog post, May 2008

'We came under fire.

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor.

'All four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.

'We were forced down and stayed down.'

WHAT HAPPENED 

They did not come under fire.

The Chinook helicopter flying in front of theirs was not hit. The one that was hit was from the 159th Aviation Division, not the 101st Airborne. There were three helicopters, not four. 

Only one Chinook was hit. None of the aircraft in Williams' flight took fire.

Williams' flight was not forced down, it landed safely.

News segment, January 30, 2015

'The helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.

'Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.'

WHAT HAPPENED

As established, their helicopter was not forced down, it was diverted due to weather conditions. 

The NBC team went to photograph the downed Chinook but were told to keep their distance as officers inspected the situation. 

After 10 minutes, officers say, they walked off with other soldiers to visit the Army armored units guarding the Forward Operating Base Rams nearby.

The NBC team remained at the site for three days with an Army unit of Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams M-1 tanks.
