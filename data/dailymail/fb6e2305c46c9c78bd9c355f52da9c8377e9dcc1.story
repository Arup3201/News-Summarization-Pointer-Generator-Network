A 42-year-old man, who had just been found guilty of sexually abusing a child, took cyanide in court moments after his verdict was read out and later died.

When court staff saw William Thomas Moore Jr take a substance in Tuscaloosa County Jail on Monday, he told them it was his medication, but shortly afterwards he was dead.

A jury had just found Moore guilty of abusing a child under the age of 12. He had not yet been sentenced but could have faced up to 20 years in prison.

Death: William Thomas Moore Jr had just been found guilty at Tuscaloosa County Courthouse when he was seen putting something in his mouth

The Northport man was dead before medical staff, who were just a few blocks away, could arrive, Tuscaloosa's emergency medical service chief Travis Parker said.

He is said to have admitted taking cyanide to jailers before he lost consciousness.

Results from a post-mortem examination were due to be released today, according to the Tuscaloosa News.

According to a press release from Sergeant Dale Phillips, Moore was seen putting an unknown substance into his mouth.

When an officer in the courtroom asked him what he had taken, Moore claimed it was his daily medication, Al.com reported.

The former pest control worker had not been in custody since his arrest in December 2011.

He was taken to a regional medical center where he was declared dead, according to Fox 6.
