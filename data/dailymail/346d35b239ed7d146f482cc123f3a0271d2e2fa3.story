Milan is the the home of high-octane glamour, while London has the edgy young talent - but for the big names, only Paris, the grande dame of fashion, will do.

This season's shows got off to a sunny start, courtesy of up-and-coming name Christine Phung whose S/S14 offering was unveiled on a rooftop with stunning views of the Eiffel Tower behind.

The collection itself was a composed effort in cobalt, white and grey, with sports-inspired tailoring and loose flowing maxis setting the tone.

Sheer genius: Chung's vision included plenty of delicate chiffon and a fluid sihouette

Phung, who previously worked for Christophe Lemaire,  Chloé and Vanessa Bruno, has only been designing since 2008 but already has numerous awards to her name - and the new collection showed why.

Elsewhere, CSI actor Gary Dourdan appeared on the catwalk at Paris' inaugural Islamic Fashion Festival where Ghea Panggabean, Hindi Mahdi, Hoda Haddad, Tom Abang Saufi and Jonathan Liang unveiled designs tailored for those who want to cover up.

But the star of today's show was undoubtedly Phung, whose elegant ensembles shimmered in the warm September sunshine.

Talented though Phung is, Paris doesn't really get going until later this week, starting with Rochas tomorrow, where rumours that creative director Marco Zanini is leaving for Schiaparelli have dogged the run-up to the show.

Thursday sees the first of the big guns with Lanvin, Carven and Roland Mouret all on the schedule.

Alexander Wang is also on the bill with his second collection for Balenciaga and is expected to enjoy a celebrity-studded front row, with Kristen Stewart and Alexa Chung among the names likely to turn out to support the young designer.

Elegant: Full skirts, neatly cropped trousers and beautifully tailored jackets were highlights of Chung's offering

Come the weekend, all eyes will be on Paris as the fashion world's heavyweights take to the runway, beginning with Raf Simons presenting his third collection for Christian Dior.

Also on the schedule is Isabel Marant, whose debut collection for H&M will appear in just over a month's time, and Vivienne Westwood, fresh from a typically controversial showing at London Fashion Week.

Other names showing in the Parisian capital over the weekend include Jean Paul Gaultier, Chloé, edgy fashion favourite Haider Ackermann and the ever-popular Celine.

If that wasn't enough, there's also Givenchy, John Galliano, Kenzo and Loewe to enjoy before Stella McCartney kicks off next week with a show on Monday morning.

Colourful: Designs in bold turquoise and crimson appeared during the show along with plenty of jewels

Expected: Former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld

Ever present: Japanese Vogue's Anna Dello Russo

Following hot on her heels comes Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent before Tuesday morning brings what many consider the highlight of Paris Fashion Week - Karl Lagerfeld's biannual extravaganza at Chanel.

Lagerfeld is followed onto the catwalk by Valentino and Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, who is expected to stage an intimate presentation rather than a full blown show according to Vogue.

Paris gets a fitting farewell on Wednesday with a grand finale courtesy of a Marc Jacobs spectacular at Louis Vuitton and the quirky girlishness of Miuccia Prada's Miu Miu.

But if the thought of waving goodbye to the fashion merry-go-round leaves you feeling unfashionably blue, then bear this in mind: it's just three months until cruise appears.
