Will Ferrell will help cover Canada's Olympic curling trials this week as his Anchorman character, Ron Burgundy

A statement from the fictitious broadcaster, said Winnipeg should 'get ready to paint the town Burgundy'

The winners of the tournament in Winnipeg, Manitoba, will represent Canada at the Sochi Olympics in February.

Burgundy said in a statement: 'Marked by the gods of broadcasting 
and placed into this shimmering green sphere like a golden egg in hay, 
chosen like an unclean jackal by Noah himself, I accept your hallowed 
task and sing out with a battle cry worthy of your love and your 
wisdom.

'And that song is, "Winnipeg, get ready to paint
 the town Burgundy!"'

In a release, Rauter said: 'It's an honour to work with such an 
esteemed colleague.

'I'm a huge fan of his work. Who are 
we talking about again?'

The original cast is returning in the upcoming sequel Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues

Ferrell has also released a fake Burgundy autobiography, Let Me Off At The Top, to tie-in with the film

The event is one of the biggest in Canadian curling and determines which team will represent Canada at the Olympics.

The unusual stunt is the latest to promote the Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which opens on December 20.

The self-congratulatory newsman got his own mock autobiography, Let Me Off At The Top: My Classy Life And Other Musings, as a tie-in to the film release.

The Newseum in Washington, which normally features exhibits on Watergate and the coverage of the assassination of JFK, is also hosting an exhibition on Burgundy featuring more than 60 props.
