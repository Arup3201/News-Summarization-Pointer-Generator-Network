Fox News unveiled its revamped newsroom Monday to the delight of critics who see comedy gold in the studio's rows of reporters dwarfed by gigantic monitors.

Newly minted breaking news head anchor Shepard Smith leads a video tour of his new Fox News Deck, where 'viewers can watch us sort it all out as it happens' on 55-inch touch screens.

While the monitors are impressively large, internet reaction to the big reveal suggests not everyone is convinced it will translate to better breaking news.

Gigantic: Fox News' Shepard Smith unveiled the new breaking news studio Monday, along with its massive, reporter-dwarfing touch screens

'That's where our journalists will be,' Smith says in the video as he walks around the new studio, 'using brand new tools to track developing stories and bring them to your screen as quickly as possible. We call these BATs. Big area touchscreens.'

According to Mashable, those nearly five-foot screens are Microsoft's Perspective Pixel touchscreens, which retail for $8,000.

Fox also confirmed to Mashable that the screens run windows 8, for those unable to see the screens for themselves.

In addition to the giant touch screens, the Fox News Deck features a wall that displays Twitter and a 38-foot-long wraparound screen that Smith can control with a wand.

Fox says the outside remodel was done to appeal to cutting edge, 'nonlinear' news consumers, but many who watched the video find the changes a little over the top.

The unveiling was immediately turned into a joke across social media.Â 

What a view: Smith, who is now the face of breaking news, shows off one of the 55-inch touchscreens, which Fox says will help revolutionize their news reporting process

Basking in the glow: A reporter--or information specialist as they're called--works a massive touchscreen. Online, real time news gathering is at the heart of the studio shakeup

'We estimate you can fit 149 new iPhones into one of those crazy new Fox News touchscreens,' tweeted @GuardianUS.

'Definitely getting these for our information specialists,' wrote @BuzzfeedBen.

Information specialists is what Smith says the reporters manning the huge screens are called. Meanwhile, some think they should be called something else.

'Fox News hires tiny little humans to work on gigantic iPads,' tweeted @BoingBoing.

The revamp comes just in time for Fox News' 17th anniversary. The changes were made while Smith was away for surgery, starting in mid-September, and the Fox News Deck has now gone live.

Smith will now make appearances on the network from his futuristic platform whenever breaking news happens, he says, or 'whenever news warrants.'
