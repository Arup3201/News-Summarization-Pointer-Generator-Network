University could become accessible only to the very rich with middle-class students unable to afford fees if the federal government's proposed cuts to higher education funding go ahead, warned the University of Sydney's Vice Chancellor.

Dr Michael Spence spoke out as thousands of people took to the street across the nation yesterday, protesting the cuts.

He said a national conversation needed to take place to make sure that entry to university still depended on merit and not wealth.

'I want the best students, not only those who can afford to pay,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Dr Spence is a supporter of uncapped fee deregulation, but thinks deregulation should be modelled on overseas universities, which have enormous fees, but where entry is dependent on academic merit.

He said that universities such as Harvard allow people of different socio-economic backgrounds to attend because they have varying levels of scholarship support available, with wealthier students paying higher fees.

'I don't think social justice requires everyone to pay the same fee [if fees are deregulated]. In fact it requires people to pay different amounts depending on their ability to pay.

'But I think you have to be careful that you don't create a trap where aspirational Australians, not just disadvantaged Australians, will be kept out,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Deanna Taylor, president of the National Union of Students, told MailOnline that Dr Spence's plan was 'a way of covertly making fee deregulation appear less harmful than it actually is.'

'Fee deregulation, no matter how you roll the dice, will lead to massive fee increases... We can’t rely on scholarships, the government should be at the forefront of easing the debt burden for students,' she said.

'We view education in the same way as we view universal healthcare – it should be universal, it should be open to everyone. Whether they’re wealthy, poor, everyone should be able to access it.'

Students are protesting the deregulation of university fees, which they argue could make popular courses at the best universities available to the rich, rather than to the deserving

Under the proposed changes, government funding for each Commonwealth-supported student would be cut by about 20 percent and universities will be free to decide their own fees for undergraduates courses.

Dr Spence emailed staff and students about the changes on Wednesday, informing them that The University of Sydney senate is yet to decide its final position on the issue.

There has been confusion about who will be affected by the cuts, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott said during a radio interview that only students who begin university in 2016 will be affected by the deregulation.

'If you start a course under one system you will finish it under one system. If you start next year your conditions of study won't change. It's only for those who start whne these changes kick in in 2016 that will have the different conditions applying to them,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio.

This claim was contradicted by a Department of Education spokesman who said: 'Students who enrol in a Commonwealth-supported place after 13 May 2014 will be charged under the existing arrangements until 31 December 2015. After this date they will be charged under the new arrangements.'

This means that thousands of school leavers hoping to start university in 2015 could be forced to select a course without knowing what fees they will be forced to pay under the deregulated system from 2016.

Mr Spence spoke out on Wednesday as police clashed with thousands of students protesting the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education funding announced in the recent federal budget.

A massive contingent of police officers struggled to contain the masses as they chanted slogans including 'bull****, come off it, our education is not for profit,' reported The Age.

Melbourne saw the most tense conflict, however demonstrations in Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane also exploded in violence and chaos.

Victorian police arrested 13 people in Melbourne who will receive court summons 'in due course' for offences relating to obstructing roadways and footpaths.

NSW police confirmed at least two arrests were made in Sydney, with a 20-year-old man remaining in police custody and likely to be charged for allegedly lighting a flare. 

The protests caused traffic chaos for commuters around the country, with the Melbourne CBD all but shut down and a northbound lane closed on Sydney's George Street at peak hour.

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young was spotted with senate hopeful Adam Bandt holding a sign that read 'A first degree shouldn't cost a second mortgage.'
