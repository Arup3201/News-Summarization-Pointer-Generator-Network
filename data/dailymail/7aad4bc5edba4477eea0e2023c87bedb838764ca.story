A former CIA director said that the U.S. is the only country that could carry out a sustained attack against Iran's nuclear facilities in an effort to dissuade any such action by Israel.

Michael Hayden, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency until 2009, granted an interview with Israel's oldest daily newspaper saying that issues regarding the location of the weapons, the stockpile of the attacker, and the collection of sufficient planning would all cause problems if Israel were to attack and not America.

'I do not underestimate the Israeli talent, but geometry and physics tell us that Iran's nuclear program would pose a difficult challenge to any military,' Mr Hayden told Haaretz.

Dissuasion: Former CIA director Michael Hayden spoke to an Israeli newspaper telling them a list of reasons why America would strike Iran more efficiently than Iran

He explained that because any thorough attack on Iran would not be a one-time event and would require repeated efforts, the United States would be better equipped because 'Israel's resources are more limited' than America's.

For decades, the relationship between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Jewish state of Israel has been contentious but more extreme rhetoric by Iranian leaders escalated the balance to a worrying tipping point.

As United Nations sanctions have done little to prevent Iran from continuing their nuclear weapons development, Israel continues to feel pressure to pre-emptively strike, but Mr Hayden was quick to push for patience, giving several reasons as justification.

'There is no absolute certainty that all targets are known,' he said of the various nuclear development sites in Iran.

Dangerous: Tensions have continued to grow over Iran's nuclear capability, and president Mahmoud Ahmandinejad (center) was see touring the facilities in 2008

Locations: Hayden said one of the problems with any potential strike would be that it will be difficult to find out where all of Iran's facilities- like this one in Bushehr- are located

'They will have to be revisited - which only the U.S. Air Force would be able to do - and the operation will only set the Iranians back some time and actually push them to do that which it is supposed to prevent, getting nuclear weapons

'While it is probably true that the so-called "window" regarding effective action is closing, there is still some time, as real decisions are to be made in 2013 or 2014.'

Mr Hayden's explanation comes just two days after President Obama publicly confirmed that American forces will be taking a number of less violent actions in an effort to dissuade Iran from doing anything drastic.

The New York Times reported that tougher sanctions on Iranian oil, a new antimissile system based out of Qatar that is specialized for the region, and varied naval exercises will show that America will get directly involved if Iran strikes.
