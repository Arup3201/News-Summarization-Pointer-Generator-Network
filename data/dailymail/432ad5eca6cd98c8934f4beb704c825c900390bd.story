He was the plucky canine who defied death after surviving a gas chamber when animal control workers tried to put him down.

But after coming away from the chamber unscathed and finding a new home, Daniel the beagle has gone from strength to strength and is now even becoming a media star.

The miracle dog was abandoned and was due to be put down by workers at the animal control facility in Florence, Alabama in a stainless-steel box.

Happy tale: Daniel appears on the Anderson Cooper show with his delighted owners Joe and Jenny Dwyer

Daniel came out of the carbon monoxide-filled chamber wagging his tail however, and has since found a new home after his stay of execution.

The brave newly-adopted pet, who was named after the biblical figure who survived the lion's den, made a television appearance on the Anderson Cooper chat show and looked in good health.

He has been adopted by Jenny and Joe Dwyer, who rehomed the lucky beagle from Eleventh Hour Rescue, the organisation who took possession of him last month.

About half of applications from people around the country seeking to adopt Daniel said they were not interested in adopting another dog if he was not available.

As Daniel excitedly sniffed his way round the chat show set, owner Joe Dwyer, from Nutley, New Jersey, explained: 'As far as we know, he was put into the gas chamber with multiple other dogs.

'When they opened the door after the gas was let in, he came out with his tail wagging, and it's nothing short of a miracle. It's just unbelievable.'

The couple adopted Daniel, who has gone to live with them and their four other dogs.

Mr Dwyer said he and his family had two ‘meet-and-greets’ with Daniel before being approved for adoption, and the dog has become fast friends with the Nutley family's other four pooches.

They have two dachshunds, a beagle mix and a pit bull mix. ‘By Thursday evening they were all lying down together,’ he said. ‘It was wonderful to see.’

Only three animals have survived the gas chamber at the animal control facility in Florence in the past 12 years. 'Maybe God just had a better plan for this one,' city spokesman Phil Stevenson said.

He said that the dog may have survived because his breathing was shallow thanks to a cold. Other variables that could allow a dog to survive include the number of animals placed in the chamber.

'Maybe we'll get a cosmetic surgeon to make all our dogs look like Daniel'

In addition the concentration of carbon monoxide, whether the chamber is airtight or gas is leaking out and the health of the animal can also have an impact on improving their slim survival chances.

At least 15 states, including New Jersey and New York, have banned carbon monoxide for euthanising shelter animals, but it is still a method used in many parts of the country.'

Mr Dwyer added that Daniel wasn't put back in the chamber after defying the carbon monoxide because workers 'didn't have the heart to put him back in'.

He added: 'They thought that possibly from the after-effects of the gas, he might die during the night. But the next morning he was still wagging his tail.'
