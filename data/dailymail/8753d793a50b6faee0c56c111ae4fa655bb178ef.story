Natalie Cochrane was brought down to earth after being told she was too fat to go on a helicopter ride over a volcano during a dream holiday to the United States.

Natalie, a businesswoman from Nottinghamshire, used to tip the scales at 19.5st but decided drastic action was needed and now weighs just 10st. 

She was on a once-in-a-life-time holiday with her brother, Nathan, 24, and father Roger, 68, which included stops in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Hawaii, where the family had planned to take a helicopter ride over a volcano.

Slender: Natalie Cochrane, 26, is now a svelte size 12 after losing more than nine stone in 12 months

This humiliation was the final straw for the former recruitment consultant from who decided to go on a radical diet, cutting her daily calorie intake from 4,000 to 500.

Natalie, 26, who is now a size 12 and weighs 10st, said: 'It makes me feel a bit sick to think of all the food I used to eat.

'I was constantly shovelling junk food in my mouth, I didn’t care what it was. I was aware of my weight but I just carried on eating too much of the wrong sort of food.'

Speaking about the moment she finally realised that she needed to do something about her bulk, she added: 'I was looking forward to the helicopter ride and and when I was told I couldn’t go, I was disappointed and embarrassed.

'I decided there and then I had to do something about my weight. That was in October 2012. When I switched to my new diet I felt light-headed at first and had a few headaches but it wasn’t long before I began to feel better and had more energy.'

Transformation: Natalie now feels much happier and healthier since losing weight

But although the helicopter ride proved to be the catalyst she needed, it wasn't the first time her weight had had an impact on her life.

'I was always a big girl,' she remembers. 'When I went to boarding school I began to notice my weight more, especially when the girls were swapping clothes and I couldn’t join in.

'I remember weighing myself when I was 16 and my age was the same as my weight.'

Natalie, a former recruitment consultant, from Colwick, near Nottingham, has now set up her own weight loss consultancy called Brand New You.

She added: 'I want to be an inspiration to people whether they want to lose one stone or ten. If I can do it anyone can - just making a few small changes can make all the difference.'

Brother Nathan said he had seen a positive change in his sister since her dramatic weight loss.

Cut down: Natalie's 4,000 calorie a day diet has now been exchanged for a healthy 500 calorie daily menu

'Natalie and I were looking through old pictures of ourselves the other day, and we hadn’t noticed before, but Natalie just looked so upset in the pictures - it’s completely different to how she is now.'I remember seeing Natalie’s face when we were on the plane to America and the meal came round. Natalie couldn’t get her table down to eat it, it was awful.

'The change in her and what she has achieved is just unbelievable and I couldn’t be more proud.'William Hadfield, specialist dietician at Nottingham University Hospitals, warned: 'Being overweight can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, depression and some cancers, to name a few.'
