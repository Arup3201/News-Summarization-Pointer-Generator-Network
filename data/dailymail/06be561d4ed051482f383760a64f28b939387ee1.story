American twins Bob and Mike Bryan clinched their 100th career title together in style by winning the US Open men’s doubles final on Sunday.

The Bryans beat No 11 seeds Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 19 minutes to claim their 16th Grand Slam title together and fifth US Open championship.

Bob said: ‘It’s an amazing relief. I was having flashbacks to my whole career towards the end of that match. It was wild. I was thinking juniors, college.

‘It was an incredible moment. I was trying to stay in the moment, but it was impossible. I mean, this number right here, we have really been looking at for a couple of years.’

The Bryans had stalled on 98 after winning in Monte Carlo in April, going on to lose the Wimbledon final in five sets to Vasek Pospisil and Jack Sock.

They finally ended a four-month drought with their 99th title in Cincinnati last month and made just five unforced errors against their Spanish opponents on Sunday as they finally hit the century mark at Flushing Meadows.

The Bryan brothers are undoubtedly the greatest doubles team ever, with their run of 100 titles stretching back to February 2001 when they won their first in Memphis.

At the age of 36, the Bryans are in the twilight of their career and view the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro as a potential swansong.

Mike said: ‘We have eyed Rio as kind of the day where we want to step away. But who knows? Might just be a short-term thing and we might keep going.’
