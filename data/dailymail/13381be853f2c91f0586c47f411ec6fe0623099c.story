Suki Waterhouse, the British model girlfriend of Hollywood star Bradley Cooper, is fronting a French Connection campaign for their new summer capsule collection, White Lies.

The London-born blonde beauty - who was recently spotted enjoying a romantic Parisian break with the Silver Linings Playbook actor - appears in a series of stripped-back photographs sporting crisp white dresses, blazers, shorts, crochet sweaters and shirts, priced from £22 to £150.

Rumoured to be the new face of Burberry, the 20-year-old model - who is good pals with Cara 'The Eyebrow' Delevingne and got her big break in a Rankin-shot collection of images for Marks & Spencer's underwear in 2011 - looks brooding and smouldering in the photographs  with slicked-back hair and a range of sultry expressions.

In a statement the brand said: 'Following on from the popular trend on the catwalk, French Connection launches a collection of all things precisely white.

'With summer just around the corner, a wardrobe full of white will bring a sense of purity and calm to anyone's wardrobe after a hectic autumn/winter season of prints and autumnal tones.'

The capsule collection of whites ranges from a crisp cotton shirt through to a little white dress incorporating the sheer ruffle trend popular for SS13.

Masculine meets feminine with the tailored jacket which sits alongside a pair of white denim shorts, an essential summer staple.

Continued the label: 'On one side, we have the 
precision cut tailoring and crisp cotton which is French Connection's 
take on clean minimalism.

'On the other, we've embraced our girlish side 
incorporating pretty lacework, sheer panelling and the beautiful 
broderie anglaise.

'All add a luxurious edge to this understated range of
 key separates and simple, yet stunning dresses.'

Waterhouse, who is 18 years younger than 38-year-old Cooper, also kick-boxes, sings and acts - last year she appeared in Pusher, a film about drugs, with Agyness Deyn.

She and Cooper met in February at a London awards ceremony and have been spending time together since. Her previous boyfriends have included indie musician Miles Kane of The Last Shadow Puppets, and The Kooks singer Luke Pritcherd.

The model, who grew up in Chiswick, west London, is no stranger to the cameras, having begun her modelling career at a tender primary school age, posing for editorial features about new toys.
