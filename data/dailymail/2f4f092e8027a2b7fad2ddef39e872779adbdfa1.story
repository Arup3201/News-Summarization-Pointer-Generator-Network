A female student has been shot and wounded by a male classmate at a Kentucky high school this afternoon.

The teen was shot in the stomach and leg after a boy, age 15 to 16, opened fire after a fight Tuesday afternoon at Fern Creek Traditional High School in Louisville, according to reports.

Police say the girl's injuries are not life-threatening and that the gunman left the building after opening fire. 

The gunman fled the high school and was arrested hours later after an intense police search. The suspect is a sophomore at the school, according to media reports.  

This is the second shooting at a US high school today. One student shot another in the leg at Albemarle High School in North Carolina just before classes started this morning.

All 1,400 students at the school were evacuated and sent to a nearby park, where they were evaluated by police and then released to their parents

In that shooting, police arrested teenager Jalen Russell. The victim, Bernard Miller, is being treated at a hospital.  

Authorities evacuated the Fern Creek High School and sent students to a nearby park while heavily-armed SWAT officers went room-by-room to ensure the danger had passed.

'This is every parent's nightmare. This is one of these days you wish would never come,' Jefferson County school board member Chris Brady told the Louisville Courier-Journal. 

WLKY-TV reports that students reported seeing a gun at the school about 1pm and the school went into lockdown before the shooting. 

Fern Creek Elementary School, which is next door, also went into lockdown and teachers held the students in the school while officers arrived.  

Students were led from Fern Creek Traditional High School in the southern part of the city. Video from television stations showed police escorting students with their hands over their heads to a nearby softball field.

Police cars surrounded the 91-year-old school.

Messages left by The Associated Press for a spokesman for Jefferson County Public Schools and MetroSafe, the city's emergency management department, were not immediately returned.

According to its website, the school concentrates on communications, media and arts. It has a student-run radio station, WFHS.

Also Tuesday, a student was shot by a fellow student outside a North Carolina high school just minutes before classes began, and the suspect then waited for police to arrive, authorities said.
