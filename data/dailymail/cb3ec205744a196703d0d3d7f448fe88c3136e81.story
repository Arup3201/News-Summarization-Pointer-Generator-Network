A schoolgirl took a fatal overdose 'on an impulse' while experimenting with self harm, an inquest has heard.

Thirteen-year-old Gabriele Rimseviciute sent pictures on the Snap Chat app to friends, showing a photograph of an arm with injuries and another holding a hand full of tablets.

An inquest in Bolton heard, that she also exchanged messages on the controversial social media site Ask FM discussing suicide.

Eventually after using the internet to research pills, the teenager - who was upset about the breakdown of her friendship with a boy - took an accidental overdose of tablets.

She was found on the bathroom floor by her mother at home in Wigan, Greater Manchester after suffering a seizure, and died two hours later in hospital.

Police examined her phones and computer and found 23 body harm photographs. She had also been exchanging messages on the controversial social media site Ask FM.

The hearing in Bolton was told Gabriele, originally from Lithuania, had been living in Britain for three years and appeared happy to family and teachers at Deanery Church of England High School in Wigan.

Her mother Vilija Achranoviciene said her daughter was popular and well-liked with a wide circle of friends. 

She had a good school attendance record and had no illness or mental health problems and Mrs Achranoviciene said she didn't know about any history self harming.

Her school also had no concerns about her well being and had said she had been 'a normal girl who had settled in well and spoke good English'.

But the hearing was told that friends discovered Gabriele had been having 'suicidal thoughts' and in the hours before her death last February she told one boy at school she could 'kill herself without hurting people.'

Mrs Achranoviciene heard her daughter being sick at 1am and went to help.

Gabriele initially  told her mother to leave but a shortly later she asked for assistance and she was found lying on the bathroom floor having a seizure. 

An ambulance took her to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan where she was pronounced dead at 3.40am.

The inquest heard the medication was kept in the kitchen and also in a first aid box which had been in her daughter's room, the inquest was told.

Det Insp Joanne Clawson of Wigan Police said Gabriele's phone and computer was examined and it was found between 23.52pm and 00.02am in the hours before her death, she had searched the internet for information about overdosing.

She added: 'We spoke to nine of her friends from school and a number were aware that she previously self harmed. Part of our questioning covered whether they informed an adult which they hadn't. In fact no parent, teacher or adult had been informed.

'Around Christmas time two of the children had received a Snap Chat message which had a picture of an arm with self harm injuries and another with a hand full of tablets. '

The officer added that as part of the investigation Gabriele's iPhone and Samsung mobile phones were examined as well as a laptop.

She said: 'Two of the friends at school confirmed they received a Snapchat on Saturday 15th February.

'The other girl didn't open the message until the following morning Sunday 16th and in doing so attempted to contact Gabriele.

When she wasn't able to she went on ASK FM and struck up conversation with someone from Lithuania who told her of Gabriele's death.

She spoke of a male school pal who had been conversing with Gabriele.

Det Insp Clawson added: 'It would appear from the conversation she had previously had conversations with this boy. He didn't think she was serious.' 

The hearing at Bolton Coroner's Court was told Gabriele, originally from Lithuania, had been living in Britain for three years and appeared happy to family and teachers at Deanery Church of England High School in Wigan

'He sent her an anti-self harming song from You Tube but a message from Gabrielle had words to the effect of "I won't be here any more".

The medication Gabriel took was not available in the UK. 

Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb said there were three reported deaths associated with high concentrations of the drug and that it could cause seizures.

Returning a conclusion of misadventure assistant coroner Simon Jones said: 'To her teachers and school and to her family Gabrielle was a happy 13-year-old with no problems. The other sequence of events is a 13-year-old girl carrying out acts of self harm taking photographs of her and having done so sending them to school friends with messages expressing thoughts of suicide and similar comments.

A supportive message posted on the AS.FM website to Gabriele

'I find it difficult to believe that a 13-year-old would understand the implications of what she was doing against a background of a young person who was clearly troubled or upset who had been self harming and who had had a disagreement with a young boy whom she had had some relations with.

'I recognise that taking a large quantity of tablets may simply be an expression of the way she feels rather than a serious attempt to end her life.. In these circumstances I don't believe for one minute Gabriele intended to kill herself.

'What I think is a far more likely explanation is that what Gabriele did was either in the form of experimenting with tablets or an expression of her mood and unhappiness in the same way that she had been self harming.

'It was a reflection of how she felt about herself and her relationship with the boy to whom she had been friends. I believe this was an impulsive act carried out shortly after a number of very brief internet searches.'
