Jonathan Brand sold his Ford Mustang to buy an engagement ring - so he printed off a life-size model of the classic American muscle car using sheets of paper from a large format printer, painstakingly glueing together everything from the wheels to the dashboard to the engine.

Amazingly, he didn't use the original car blueprints for the assembly - instead, he created the model based on his memories and pictures of old Ford Mustangs. 

Amazingly, Brand used no technical drawings whatsoever in the assembly - instead, he created the model from old photos

The engine was meticulously glued together from individual printed out sheets of paper - even piping was created from folded and glued sheets

Brand creates a 3D model on his PC, then prints off 'jigsaw pieces' to create the 3D parts, gluing sheets together to create everything from tyres to dashboard components.

The sheets were printed on a large-format paper printer, then glued together. Nothing else was used in the construction.

'I cut, fold and glue shapes together much like a complicated three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle,' says Brand, on the technology site Humans Invent.

The finished artwork is called One Piece at a Time, after Johnny Cash's song about a Detroit worker who steals and builds a Cadillac part by part

The finished artwork is called One Piece at a Time – a nod to Johnny 
Cash’s song about a Detroit worker who steals and builds a Cadillac part
by part.

Humans Invent says, 'Given the large amount of printed paper involved, and the cost
of ink cartridges, however, we’re wondering whether Brand could have 
actually bought his original Ford Mustang back again?'
