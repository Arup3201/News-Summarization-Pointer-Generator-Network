FIFA president Sepp Blatter came under intense pressure today as leading figures in the English game joined the calls for him to resign over his racism gaffe.

The world of football has united in calling for the controversial head of FIFA to quit after he dismissed on-pitch racism during a TV interview.

Today, Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, and UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson both weighed in to the debate, saying it was time for Blatter to step down.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Taylor said: 'I just feel it's the straw that broke the camel's back.

Comments: Sepp Blatter has provoked more controversy by claiming that racism in football can be solved with a handshake

'When you see the corruption they've had at FIFA, the comments he made about homosexuals not going to Qatar, the way he talked about women's football, the style of the arrangements for the World Cup, the fact he won't have technology. I think it's really time to move over for Michel Platini.

'It is embarrassing – if one person should get it about racism it is the head of FIFA, which has 200 countries in the world, is so diverse with different cultures, creeds and colours.'

Sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'This is incredibly serious but it is part of a pattern of behaviour.'

Asked whether Mr Blatter should go, he 
told BBC Radio Five Live: 'Yes. I can't see there's anything terribly 
new in this. We've been saying this for some time.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband also weighed 
into the row, branding Mr Blatter's comments a 'disgrace' and saying 
that world of football needed new leadership.

Blatter today became embroiled in a Twitter war-of-words with England player Rio Ferdinand, whose brother Anton is currently involved in a racism claim with the Football Association over comments allegedly made by John Terry.

The Manchester United defender contacted Blatter's Twitter account directly, writing: '@SeppBlatter your comments on racism are so condescending its almost laughable. If fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok?'.

Ferdinand also criticised FIFA's 
attempts to clarify Blatter's comments with a statement on their website

Sexwale, who was imprisoned on Robben Island during the apartheid era.

Ferdinand wrote: 'Fifa clear up the blatter comments with a pic of him posing with a black man..I need the hand covering eyes symbol!!'

Blatter was stung into a response today and replied directly to Ferdinand saying: 'The "black man" as you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in Africa.

'We have done several joint activities to raise awareness on the struggle against racism in South Africa. FIFA has a long standing and proud record in the area of anti-discrimination which will continue.'

But Ferdinand posted more tweets today, accusing Blatter of ignorance.

He wrote: 'To say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject.

A second message read: 'I guess you now have the full support of all the women, gay community + people against racism in football....'.

A third tweet said: 'If we want 2 stamp out racism in society a football pitch is a good place to start-loved by billions of people around the world'.

The controversy started when Blatter was asked directly by a CNN reporter if racism exists on the pitch, Blatter denied it and said such incidents should simply be settled by a handshake at the end of the match.

'I would deny it,' he said. 'There is no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards another, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is affected by that, he should say that this is a game.

'We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands, and this can happen.

'On the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game you have the next game where you can behave better.'

To a reporter from Al-Jazeera he simply compounded the situation. 

'During a match you may say something to somebody who is not exactly looking like you,' he said. 'But at the end... it's forgotten.'

It comes as Luis Suarez was charged by the FA over allegations that he racially abused Patrice Evra.

At the same time, England captain John Terry remains the subject of an FA inquiry and a formal Metropolitan Police investigation into claims that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road last month.

Now Blatter is facing a fight to hold on to his job after a backlash from the world of football.

In a statement, Blatter said: 'I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination infootball and in society.

'I have been personally leading this battle against racism in football, which FIFA has been fighting against throughout the past years through campaigns in all of our competitions such as the 'Say no to racism' campaign.

'I also know that racism unfortunately continues to exist in football, and I have never denied this. 

'My comments have been misunderstood. What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, you have 'battles' with your opponents, and sometimes things are done which are wrong. But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologise to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake hands, and when the game is over, it is over.

'Anyone who has played a football match, or a match in any sport, knows that this is the case.'
