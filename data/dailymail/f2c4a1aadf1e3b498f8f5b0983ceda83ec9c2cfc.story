Californian workers could soon be earning a minimum wage of $10 an hour thanks to a bill that is expected to be signed by Governor Jerry Brown.

If it is approved, California would have one of the highest rates in the nation once the increase takes place in three years. 

Washington state currently has the top minimum wage at $9.19 an hour, an amount that is pegged to rise with inflation. Some cities, including San Francisco, have slightly higher minimum wages.

The state Senate approved AB10 on a party-line 26-11 vote, sending it to the Assembly for a final vote that will be a mere formality before it goes to the governor.

Mr Brown indicated earlier this week that he would sign the bill, calling it an overdue piece of legislation that would help working-class families.

The bill would gradually raise California’s minimum wage from the current $8 an hour to $10 by 2016.

It would be the first increase in the state’s minimum wage in six years, and comes amid a national debate over whether it is fair to pay fast-food workers, retail clerks and others wages so low that they often have to work second or third jobs.

The rise would also be felt in Hollywood by putting pressure on pay rates for lower-rung production jobs, movie theater works and other entry-level positions.

Democrats said the bill by assemblyman Luis Alejo would help workers left behind during the recent recession.

The California Chamber of Commerce feared however that it would drive up businesses’ costs by ratcheting up other wages and compensation payments.

'We have it tagged as a job killer, given the increased costs businesses will be faced with,' Jennifer Barrera, an advocate for the chamber, said before the vote.

The bill generated a detailed, statistic-laced, 40-minute debate in the Senate.

'If you give people a couple more dollars an hour … to spend in their communities, spend it they will. They’re not going to put it into a hedge fund,' San Diego Senator Marty Block said.

He added: 'Nothing will make small businesses happier. This will stimulate the economy, as well as helping people’s lives.'

But Republican lawmakers said it would harm the economy, price low-skilled workers out of the market and encourage businesses to cut jobs.

'This is a classic example with how out of touch state leaders are,' Senator Jim Nielsen said.

Senator Ted Gaines likened the raise to calls to increase the price of tobacco as a way to deter people from using it. 'If you make something more expensive, people will buy less of it,' he said.

Democrats who make up the majority of the Legislature called the wage hike a matter of economic justice.

'The American Dream is clearly fading fast,' San Francisco Senator Mark Leno said. 'The income disparity in this country has not been this severe since 1917.'

If it becomes law, California would gradually overtake Washington state. Neighboring Oregon and Nevada also have higher basic wages.

Federal law sets a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, but California is among 19 states and the District of Columbia that set a higher state minimum wage.

The federal minimum provides $15,080 a year assuming 40-hour work week, which is $50 below the federal poverty line for a family of two.

More than 15 million workers nationally earn the national minimum, which compares to the median national salary of $40,350, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

President Obama has sought an increase of the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. San Francisco currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage at $10.50 an hour.
