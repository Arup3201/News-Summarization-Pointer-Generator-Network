A new Red Bull advert which makes light of the sinking of the Titanic has outraged relatives of those who died in the tragedy.

The advert - which implies that the ship might not have sunk had it been 'given wings' by the drink - has been called 'blatantly offensive' by the Titanic Heritage Trust.

The Advertising Standards Authority has also received 46 official complaints about the animated advert.

The advert opens showing a branded Red Bull crate being raised onto a ship

As the crate ascends, a dockworker (left) utters the catchphrase that the drink 'gives you wings' to the captain (right)

The cartoon shows a crate of the drink - which advertisers say 'gives you wings' - being winched onto an unidentified ship.

The captain asks a dockhand what the drink is, and on hearing the beverage's catchphrase - that 'it gives you wings' he questions why a ship would ever need wings.

The crate is then lowered from the ship - revealing that the boat in question is the Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, leading to more than 1,500 deaths.

Relatives of victims and campaigners have claimed that the advert is in bad taste because it suggests an energy drink may have saved their lives

The Titanic Heritage Trust, formed to 'preserve, protect, respect and remember' those who died in the tragedy, has condemned the advert.

Trust founder Howard Nelson said he was considering complaining to advertising regulators.

He said: 'It is very offensive and just disrespectful.

'We
 appreciate there will be commercial ventures involving the Titanic 
which we say is fine - as long as it is in good taste and respectful. 
This is not.

'There is a difference between making a joke and this.

'I get jokes all the time about icebergs and the like, taking the mick out of my interest in the Titanic, but that is banter.

'This is blatantly offensive because it is taking the mick out of the people who have passed away.

'It would be the same if someone did something similar about 9/11 - there would be an uproar. This is no different.'

Red Bull has so far refused to comment on objections to the advert, which has prompted 46 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority

Clifford Ismay, 57, a relative of Titanic owner Joseph Bruce Ismay, called the advert 'despicable'.

He
 said: 'I have a sense of humour but I really don’t like the idea - in 
fact I find it quite sickening considering so many people died on that 
night.

'With their 
slogan ‘Red Bull gives you wings’ I can only assume that they are 
referring to the idea that if all those people had Red Bull - or wings -
 then they would have been OK.

'I don’t mind people making a joke about things, but I don’t think lots 
of people dying like that is something you should be laughing at.

'It’s despicable. I think the Titanic, and the people involved, should be treated with dignity and respect.'

The Advertising Standards Authority said: “We have received 46 complaints about the Red Bull Titanic advert so far.

'They believe the reference to the Titanic is tasteless and offensive.

'We’re only in the early stages. We’ll assess the complaints and establish whether there are grounds for further action. No investigation has been launched at this stage.'

Austrian-owned Red Bull did not respond when asked to comment on the advert.
