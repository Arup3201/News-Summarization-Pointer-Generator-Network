Environmental writer Paul Brodeur has filed a $1 million defamation lawsuit against the producers of American Hustle for misquoting him in the hit film's memorable microwave fire scene.

The 83-year-old journalist filed his lawsuit against Atlas Entertainment, Annapurna Productions and Columbia Pictures, according to an article on Thursday by TMZ.

Jennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn in the scene started a small kitchen fire after putting a metal container in the newfangled device that con man Irving Rosenfeld, played by Christian Bale, called a 'science oven'.

Irving becomes upset because he previously warned Rosalyn not to put metal in the microwave, but she puts him on the defensive by claiming that she read in an article that microwaves 'take all the nutrition out of food.'

'I read it in an article, look, by Paul Brodeur,' Rosalyn said while handing Irving a magazine.

'Bring something into this house that's going to take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire. Thank god for me,' she said in one of the film's comic moments.

Brodeur in his lawsuit claimed that his reputation in the scientific community has suffered as a result of the scene and he's been subject to scorn and ridicule.

While writing variously pieces about microwaves over the years, including a book called The Zapping of America, he claims to have never said that the cooking devices affect the nutrients of food. 

The author was seeking $1 million from the defendants, according to the lawsuit.

He also was seeking a court order to have his name removed from all copies of the film.

The 'science oven' fire scene was the first clip from the movie that was released in November 2013 before its opening.

The film was released in December 2013 and went on to earn more than $250 million while gaining 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picutre.

The story was loosely based on the FBI's ABSCAM sting operation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Yahoo! are reporting that the lawsuit will be interesting, because the disclaimer at the start of the film said: 'Some of this actually happened.'

The film starred Bale, Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams, and was written by Russell and Eric Warren Singer.

Brodeur earlier this year wrote a letter to the Huffington Post stating that he never wrote 'in any way that a microwave does any such thing' after the site included the 'science oven' scene among its 17 favourite movie moments of 2013.

He noted that he sent a 'strongly worded letter' to American Hustle producers claiming they defamed him and damaged his reputation.

Brodeur became a staff writer for The New Yorker in 1958 and has published numerous investigative science articles.
