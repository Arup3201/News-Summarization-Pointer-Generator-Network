Startling differences in how long people can expect to lead healthy lives in the North of England compared to the South have been exposed for the first time.

Residents of the wealthiest southern parts of the country can expect to stay well and active for as much as 18 years longer than the nation’s poorest, yesterday’s official figures show.

But in the North and deprived parts of London, illness and disability start much earlier. At worst, in the North East, people can expect health problems to restrict their lives five years before pension age.

Divide: People in Richmond are the healthiest while people in Manchester and other areas of the north struggle with their health more

The Office for National Statistics figures are the first published estimates for healthy life expectancy – the age people are likely to reach before ill health seriously affects their quality of life.

They show that an affluent borough in south-west London is the fittest part of the country.

In green, suburban Richmond upon Thames, newborn girls and boys are likely to live beyond 70 without suffering life-limiting illnesses.

Healthy life expectancy for babies born there now is 70.3 years for men, and 72.1 years for women.

At the other end of the healthy living spectrum are Manchester, for men, and Tower Hamlets, for women.

The London borough of Richmond upon Thames has the highest healthy life expectancy (HLE) in England, according to the Office of National Statistics. Whereas life expectancy is an estimate of how many years a person might be expected to live, healthy life expectancy is an estimate of how many years they might live in a 'healthy' state

Men and women in Richmond upon Thames (above) have an HLE of 70.3 years and 72.1 years respectively

The lowest HLE was in Manchester (above) for men at 55 years and Tower Hamlets for women at 54.1 years - a 15-year gap compared to Richmond upon Thames

In Manchester men will typically find their health failing after 55, while in Tower Hamlets, a short distance across London from Richmond, the estimates say ill health for women begins at 54.1 years of age.

The
findings are based on the Annual Population Survey, a state survey that
questions more than 250,000 people, in the years 2009 to 2011.

The
questionnaire asked whether people’s general health was very good, 
good, fair, bad or very bad, and whether they had any long-standing 
disabilities that limited day-to-day activities.

The ONS cautioned that the estimates do not give a definitive picture of the health people can expect as they age, partly because mortality and health continue to change, and partly because of the impact of migration.

However the findings undoubtedly reveal large regional differences.

The
report said: ‘The pattern across regions shows a prominent North-South 
divide: healthy life expectancy in the South East, South West and the 
East of England was significantly higher than the England average.

‘The West Midlands, North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber were significantly lower.’

The
report added that healthy life expectancy for men and women in the East
Midlands, West Midlands, London, Yorkshire and the Humber, North East 
and North West was well below 65, which is the state pension age for men
now and for women from 2018.

It added: ‘Those living in the southern 
regions enjoy not only longer life expectancies but also greater 
proportions of their longer lives in a favourable health state compared 
with their counterparts living in the north.’

The ONS said the area with the highest gender inequality in life expectancy was Blackpool (above), where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years

Dr
John Middleton, of the Faculty of Public Health, a professional body, 
said: ‘These figures are an important part of a bigger picture of data 
that tells us why some people live longer than others.

‘We
know healthy life expectancy is determined by our chances  of being in a
job, living in decent housing and having an adequate income.

‘Clearly having a healthy lifestyle makes a big difference, but so does being in employment.

‘There
are also variations within towns and cities. Parts of Manchester will 
have better results than others, and there may well be places near 
Richmond where people do not fare as well as these figures suggest.’

In
every area, both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were 
longer for women than for men. The smallest gap was in Rutland, where 
women are expected to live just 1.9 years longer than men.

The borough of Richmond Upon Thames contains a number of affluent 'villages' including Kew, Barnes and Hampton - and more than a third of it is open green space.

Unemployment in the borough currently stands at 4 per cent, one of the lowest in Britain.

According to the latest census figures, Richmond upon Thames is one of the least ethnically diverse boroughs in London, with a 
non-white population of 14 per cent. 

It is also ranked as having the highest quality natural environment in London.

By
contrast, the ONS said, the biggest difference between men and women 
was Blackpool, where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years.

Michelle
Mitchell, director general of charity Age UK, spoke out against plans 
to raise the state pension age, warning that in future most people will 
not be able to enjoy any of their retirement while still healthy.

State pension ages for both men and women will begin to go up to 66 after 2020 – and will rise to 68 in the 2040s.

Miss
Mitchell said: ‘These figures reveal the huge variations in the health 
of older people across England. It is further evidence that wealthier 
parts of the country have significantly more older people in good health
than poorer areas.

‘These 
glaring health inequalities must be tackled urgently, particularly as 
the Government is contemplating further increases to the state pension 
age.

‘Otherwise the 
situation could easily arise where the average person in many areas will
not enjoy any retirement in good health.’

A
Department of Health spokesman said: ‘These figures highlight that we 
must continue to work to narrow the gap in health inequalities because 
everyone should have the same opportunity to lead a healthy life, no 
matter where they live or who they are.

‘Local councils have received ring-fenced budgets to help local people get healthier and to reduce health inequalities.’
