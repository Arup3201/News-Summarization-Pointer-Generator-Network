It took a 'record-breaking' 80 anti-venom vials to save the life of Benjamin Smith who was bitten by North America's largest venomous snake in Florida more than two weeks ago.

But not only did the 11-year-old survive the eastern diamondback rattlesnake's potentially lethal bite, he has claimed its skin as a symbol of his triumph.

Record treatment: Benjamin Smith, 11, from Florida, is lucky to be alive after being bitten by the highly venomous eastern diamondback rattlesnake

Benjamin was running through a wooded area at a 
friend’s birthday party in Newberry when he felt a sharp pain, like a knife had sliced through his right leg.

When he looked down, he saw the five-foot rattlesnake shaking its tail.

The Newberry boy started running before the defensive snake could strike a second time.

He was scooped up by his friends and older sister who carried him to safety, according to The Gainesville Sun.

The 65-pound boy was rushed to University of Florida Health Shands Hospital where he was given about 80 vials of anti-venom - what doctors believe is a new record.

Last year, six-year-old Kaden Rivera was on the brink of death after being bitten by a deadly rattlesnake during a camping trip.

Only after 42 vials of anti-venom did he stop frothing at the mouth and begin to stabilize.

Most venomous snakebites usually require about four to 10 vials of anti-venom.

And starting from about $500 per vial, depending on the type of snake, emergency treatment can be extremely costly.

Benjamin's mother, Heather Smith, said her son was lucky to be alive.

'He is pretty much back to normal,' she told FoxNews.com.

'Now he just needs to
go for physical therapy on his leg.

'We have had a huge outpouring of prayers. The community has been extremely supportive.'

Benjamin even received a basketball 
autographed by members of the University of Florida men's basketball 
team.

After the attack, Benjamin's friend - the 
birthday boy - and his father hunted down the pit viper and killed
it, according to FoxNews.com.

They gave it to Benjamin, who is deciding what to do with it.

'Ben
wanted to make a wallet, but has been told by the taxidermist that it 
would not hold up well,' Smith said.

'We are having the snake skin 
preserved and Ben will decide later how to display it or if he wants to 
make something with the skin.'

Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes are the most venomous snakes in North America

According to National Geographic, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake is the largest venomous snake in North 
America.

It can reach up to eight feet in length and weigh up to 10 
pounds, with powerful hemotoxin in its venom that kills red blood cells 
and causes tissue damage.

These killers generally live in the dry,
pine flatwoods, sandy woodlands, and coastal scrub habitats from 
southern North Carolina to Florida and west to Louisiana, surviving on 
rats, mice, squirrels and birds.
