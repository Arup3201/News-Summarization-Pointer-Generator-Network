Friends have voiced their grief over the tragic incident. Cheryl  Rider, a long standing friend of the couple, told Daily Mail Australia she was shocked by the news.

 'I'm still just stunned it has happened and feel for their families right now as this is something no one should have to go through.'

Ms Rider said Ms Griffoen had recently contacted her saying the couple were having 'the time of their life.'

 'Tan and Dean were the essence of happiness. They were the most genuine people and loyal, fun and supportive friends. The world will definitely be a sadder place now.'

The couple used the site to document their travelling experience.

In one post from Sani Pass in South Africa, Mr Griffoen wrote: 'The scenery is so amazing it’s like driving through the Grand Canyon all the time. Everywhere you look its huge cliffs and massively steep mountains.

The couple posted the entire itinerary of their planned two-and-a-half year trip, which was set to cover Europe, Asia, and North and South America.

They had also used the blog to set up a charity to help people in the areas they encountered during the trip.

Mr Griffoen wrote: 'A lot of the places Tanya and I will visit along our trip are less fortunate than we all are.

'We thought a fun way for us to raise even a small amount of money to put toward local charity's or local communities along the way would be for people to ask or dare us to participate in odd job.’ 

Courier Mail has reported the couple had quit their jobs in order to take the trip.
