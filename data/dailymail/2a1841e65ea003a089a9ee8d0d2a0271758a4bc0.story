Stoke City manager Mark Hughes will be given money to spend in the summer to maintain his side’s ambitions for European football after signing a new four-year contract.

The 51-year-old has penned fresh terms which commit him to the Britannia Stadium until the summer of 2019.

He has been in talks for some time but was always positive about extending his stay.

‘I’m delighted to have signed a new contract,’ Hughes said yesterday. ‘It’s exciting times for Stoke City. Everyone can see there’s more progress to be made and we want to see how far we can take the club.’

Hughes has only spent £6.2million in four transfer windows since replacing Tony Pulis but guided Stoke to their highest Premier League finish and points total last season, and is on course to improve again this campaign.

Bojan, a £800,000 signing from Barcelona, was a huge success before rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in January.

Hughes added: ‘This season has been more difficult due to circumstances, like injuries to key players, but we’ve still been very competitive. We can do even better next season with a little bit more investment.’
