An amazing jetpack 30 years in the making that will let customers soar though the skies like a super hero is a step closer to being released to the public.

Test flights of Martin Jetpack's 12th and latest prototype are underway after tweaks were made to the design to boost its performance and maneuverability.

The machine enables a pilot to stand on a platform and use a console to control two vertical engines 
that mimic the behaviour of the jet engines on a aircraft and can reach a
height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph.

Flying high: The P12 machine can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph. It has been designed to be more maneuverable than its predecessor due and could be used as a first response vehicle

New Zealander Glenn Martin has created extraordinary piece of machinery in which a 'pilot' stands on a platform at the front, using a console to control two vertical engines that mimic the behaviour of the jet engines. The P11 model is pictured

The firm is is currently focused on rolling the jetpack out as a first responder vehicle

While the company plans on launching the 
jetpack as a recreational vehice in the future, it is currently focused 
on rolling it out as a first responder vehicle for daring rescues and an
unmanned air vehicle for heavy lifting.

The vehicle was inspired by childhood TV 
shows such as Thunderbirds and Lost in Space, according to  New 
Zealander Glenn Martin, who  began working in his Christchurch garage 30
years ago on a device which he hoped would one day see a man speeding 
through the air under his own power.

It is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a British luxury car - £90,000 - while a specially-fitted unit, with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £127,000.

The company recently modified its latest P12 prototype to  move the ducts lower and add a balance shaft to reduce vibration from the 200 hp engine.

It said the P12 will be the basis for its pre-production model.

Martin Aircraft Company’s CEO, Peter Coker, said that the P12 prototype was a 'huge step up' from the previous prototype.

The company's present focus is on further improving the performance of the jetpack through some engine refinements in order to ready the jetpack for commercial sale. 'The jetpack continues to attract interest from potential customers and investors worldwide,' said Mr Coker (not pictured)

'The jetpack continues to attract interest from potential customers and investors worldwide,' said Mr Coker.

'We are focussing initially on developing the jetpack for use as a first responder vehicle and heavy lift unmanned air vehicle'.

The company is also developing a jetpack simulator that will be available for sale in the next few months.  

Bird's eye view: The futuristic jetpack jet engines can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph

It is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a British luxury car - £90,000 - while a specially-fitted unit, with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £127,000

The jetpack is officially registered as a 'Class One Microlight', standing 2.20m and with a width 2.14m. 

Its engines are 200hp and there is a 45litre fuel capacity.

It can cover a distance of 18 miles for a period of around 30 minutes and runs on normal car petrol and two stroke oil.

Its noise is the limit of a car - 90 decibels.Take off weight: 725lb.

Pilot visibility: To be flown only by daylight and visually.

Can be flown in light rain.

The New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that the jetpack had been issued with an experimental flight permit for development test flying, meaning that a person can be used to fly the device.

A mixture of manned and unmanned test flights have been carried out, whereas previously the company used a dummy at the controls, while technicians on the ground have guided the jetpack by remote control.

As part of the testing programme, engineers at the firm have made modifications to the machine's V4 engine to make it more durable and decrease the maintenance requirements.

They hope to have made the final adjustments to the engine by the end of this year.

Already some 30 budding James Bonds have put down deposits on the futuristic personal transport, inspired by the words of test pilot James Bowker who has flown the jetpack.

'It's a mixture of scary and just awesome,' said Mr Bowker after the indoor flight.

'Flying
it remotely means you can see the aircraft and so 
you can see everything that happens, but when you're actually in it, 
it's all behind you and you just get lifted off the ground. It's just 
awesome.'

He said there was still a 'little bit more work to do' before the jetpack is ready to be sold but there had been 'tremendous interest' from around the world.

'It's a really exciting time for us,' said Mr Peter Coker chief executive of Martin Aircraft whose company is working in partnership with Emirates to put the final touches to the futuristic machine.

'We have had manned flights on lots of the prototypes in varying forms but this is the first one that is totally manoeuvrable.'

Some may think that the invention is just a toy for the wealthy but the machine could have life-saving implications. One idea is to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames

He added that he was convinced that the jetpack is going to change the whole concept of light aircraft.

'This is the motorbike of the sky,' he said.

He conceded that while the machine might seem like a toy for the wealthy as they zap from town house to country retreat, bosses at Martin believed their creation could have life-saving implications

One idea, said Mr Coker, was to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames.

It could also be used to help in the rescue of pee stranded in difficult to reach areas. Even the Thunderbirds would appreciate that.

This is neither a pack, nor jet powered. 

Personal Helicopter might be a more accurate description.

So what happens if you high in the air and something breaks?

Sorry, but it's just too big to be called a 'jetpack'. We all want something the size of a small rucksack!

Keep a spare on hand to rescue the first one ;)

But seriously - good on him for inventing a fun & useful craft!

"It could also be used to help in the rescue of pee stranded in difficult to reach areas"......I PROTEST!...what about all the other poor vegetables left behind? Or is the pilot allowed to "pee" while flying ?
