New photographs of Alice Gross were released by her family today as they finally said farewell to the teenager at a humanist funeral service designed to 'focus on the joy of Alice's life'. 

As the family of the murdered teenager described her as 'so spirited, so present, so vital and so full of promise', they joined Alice's friends and teachers at a humanist funeral service near their family home in Hanwell, west London.

Her parents, Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, and sister, Nina, said: 'We find it almost impossible to understand what has happened and that we have to say goodbye to her',

But they said they wanted the schoolgirl's funeral - held eight weeks to the day since she left home for the last time - to 'focus on the joy of Alice's life and the joy of having known her'.

Traffic stopped and local residents came out of their houses and bowed their heads as the funeral procession swept past the flower-covered clock tower in Hanwell, west London, which has become a focal point for those mourning the 14-year-old.

The hearse carried a brightly coloured coffin which had been painted by Alice's grandmother and decorated with a meadow scene showing Alice's pet cats and dog.   

The schoolgirl's famly thanked people in their local community in Hanwell 'for being so kind and supportive', and said the funeral was a 'humanist celebration... full of music, with videos of Alice playing and singing songs she wrote herself'. 

Alice's parents and sister paid tribute to their daughter, while her grandfather read Surprised By Joy by William Wordsworth, written by the poet at the loss of his own three-year-old daughter.

The coffin, featuring Alice's cats Lottie, Louis and Pattie, and dog, Peggy, was painted to reflect her love of nature by her grandmother, Anne Hodgkiss, and family friend, Carole McCourt. 

Meanwhile, mourners sang You Are My Sunshine, while Alice's music teachers performed musical tributes to the schoolgirl who was known for her musical talent.

Paying their respects: Alice's murder this summer left the local community in west London devastated

The disappearance two months ago and murder of the Hanwell schoolgirl devastated the local community

Yellow ribbons - once a symbol of hope that Alice would be found alive - festooned trees, railings and traffic signs along the funeral cortege's route.

Locals lit small candles arranged to spell out 'We love you Alice' and watered flowers, many of them yellow, ahead of the funeral.

One note left at the clock tower said: 'You will always be in our hearts.' 

Marion McCarthy, 39, a nurse from nearby Ealing, said the effect on the community had been 'horrendous'.

She said: 'It has brought a sense of shock. We have been united. I'm a mother of a girl the same age. It's every parent's worst scenario ever.' 

Only family and friends were invited to attend the funeral today, but there will be a public memorial ceremony for her on 2 November at Greenford Town Hall. 

The family said they wanted to thank local people 'whose outpouring of support and grief has touched them very deeply'. 

The beautifully decorated coffin was a reminder that Alice had barely entered her teens before she was killed

'You will always be the brightest star in the sky': The hearse was filled with wreaths and notes to Alice

The community in Hanwell, west London, was deeply affected by the murder of the well-loved teenager

They added: 'We would like to thank everyone for being so kind and supportive. 

'We have been moved by the depth of sympathy and compassion around us, not only from close family and friends but also from the local community.'

And they asked those who wanted to make a donation to give to the Youth Music charity in Alice's memory.

In a statement released by the family, they spoke of her love for music, saying: 'A tribute and donation page has been set up in Alice's memory with Youth Music. 

'We feel this is a fitting tribute to our daughter Alice. She loved music and loved making music and would have wanted other children to experience this joy.' 

Ealing Council leader Julian Bell said: 'Even on this most difficult of days, it is testament to the family's generosity of spirit that they would rather people remembered Alice by making a donation to the charity the National Foundation for Youth Music.'

Flags were flown at half-mast over Ealing Town Hall, symbolising the grief of the local community which was devastated by Alice's disappearance and murder over the summer.

Grief: Alice lived with her parents Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross and her elder sister, Nina Gross

Alice left her family home in Hanwell at around 1pm on 28 August, telling her mother she would be home by 6pm.

At 4.26pm she was captured on CCTV walking along the canal under Trumper's Way, a bridge crossing the canal, heading back towards Hanwell.  CCTV also showed a cyclist, later identified as murder suspect Arnis Zalkalns, cycling a few minutes behind her.

On 1 September her parents appealed for her to get in touch, saying they desperately missed her. 

On 3 September convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was last seen at home in Ealing, where he lived with his partner and child.

The next day Zalkalns, a builder from Latvia, failed to meet a friend and bike to work with him - Zalkalns, who rode a red Trek mountain bike, would always cycle along the Grand Union Canal to work on a building site in Isleworth. 

On 5 September Zalkalns was reported missing from his home to police.

Six days later, police say builders found Alice's bag in undergrowth near the canal the day after she went missing.  It contained the trainers she was wearing when she left her house, underwear, and rubbish from her packed lunch, but not her white iPhone, which was last used on 28 August.

On 16 September detectives appeared on BBC Crimewatch appealing for help in tracing Alice and saying they wanted to find another missing person, Arnis Zalkalns.

Two days later, they admitted they were treating him as a suspect, and the day after that, a reward of £20,000 for information leading to Alice was announced.  Police said the hunt for Alice and her killer was the biggest manhunt staged by the Met since the 7/7 London bombings in 2005.

On the weekend of 20/21 September, British detectives finally asked police in Latvia, where Zalkalns had a conviction for murdering his wife, for help.

On 30 September, Alice's body was found in the River Brent, covered in plastic and hidden under logs.

Zalkalns' body was found hanged in woodland in Boston Manor Park, just a mile from where Alice's body was found, on 4 October.

The general labourer, who worked at a building site in Isleworth, west London, is believed to have come to the UK in 2007, but authorities here are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction.

A review of how the case was handled is currently being carried out by Scotland Yard.

Inquests into both their deaths have been opened and adjourned, with further tests going on to find out how Alice died.
