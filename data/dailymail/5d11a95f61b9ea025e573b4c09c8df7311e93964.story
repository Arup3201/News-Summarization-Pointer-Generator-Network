Sharing selfies with friends, Instagramming pictures of her shoes and tweeting about the latest blockbuster, Helena Burns sounds like any other social media-loving young women.

Except that this young woman has a higher calling than most, and is using modern technology to spread the age-old teachings of God.

Chicago-based Sister Helena is one of a growing number of young nuns hell bent on using social media to spread the word of the Almighty.

Streetwise sister: Sister Helena Burns is a nun with a mission to spread God's word via social media

And that means getting down with the 
kids. As well as her own blog and YouTube channel the American Sister has a Facebook page, vine, Pinterset and Instagram account and currently 14,600 Twitter followers.

Her Twitter handle reads: 'Media nun tweets God, Theology of Body, Media Literacy, Philosophy. Proof God exists: hummingbirds, hockey, coffee' and followers of @SrHelenaBurns can expect to see tweets on current affairs, pictures of her travels around various orders of the world, re-tweets from religious blogger friends and snaps of heartwarming proverbs.

Flamehaired Sister Helena says: 'I was going to be an ornithologist, but God zapped me and I now belong 
to the Daughters of St. Paul.'

Sister Helena told The Atlantic: 'I try to really keep up with the 
comments on my blog, and also Twitter and Facebook. I’m also on 
Instagram and Vine a little bit. How I do it is during the day, while 
I’m doing my other work, I’ll keep zipping over to social media.'

From Jesus to Noah: Sister Helena likes to share snaps of her favourite food, drink, men and movies

She joined the Daughters of St. Paul to spread the word through media having studied philosophy and theology as well as screenwriting, and in between giving workshops, and running her mini social media empire she also finds time to review films (including male stripper film Magic Mike, which she says she reviewed without having actually watched), work as a writer/producer and is also finishing as M.A. in Media Literacy Education.

Her order was founded in 1915 by Italian priest Giacomo Alberione who saw a need for the Church to start using media more 
effectively, and his message still inspires today.

Sister Helena said: 'He was the first one to get it. He was not afraid of technology, not afraid of media. For 
him, there was no dichotomy between God and technology.

'I
 think we have a long way to go in putting more funds there,' she said. 
'The Catholic Church is very good at education, tending the poor, soup 
kitchens, supporting families in need, missionary work. But when it 
comes to media, we don't value it enough.'

She said: 'I want to use the latest, most modern, 
most efficacious media and media technology to reach the greatest number
 of people with the holy spirit.'
