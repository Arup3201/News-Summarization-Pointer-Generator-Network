A shocking video shows two teenage girls in school uniform embroiled a vicious punch-up while dozens of other schoolgirls stand around filming the incident.

Carmine Ramon and Pirra Meraz, both 15, are seen squaring up to each other before launching into a violent brawl on a beach near the city of Veracruz in southeast Mexico.

The pair from Veracruz High School are seen attempting to punch each other in the face and pull each other's hair before both fall to the ground and continue to raining blows on each other.

Dozens of other pupils from the school are on the beach and watch the whole violent episode. 

But none of them try to stop the fight and instead are heard laughing, encouraging the girls and filming the incident on their mobile phones.

One of the bystanders can be heard saying: 'Beat her, beat her, break her face. Don't stop.'

The teenagers were rowing over a boy, with Carmine warning Pirra not to speak to her boyfriend again or there might be trouble.

Pirra in turn denied even knowing he was, and accused her opponent of being loose.

Despite widespread outrage in Mexico over the violence, so far neither school officials nor education chiefs in the district have made any comment on the shocking video.

The school was only recently in the news after it was hit by a funding crisis at the start of the month that led to teachers accusing education chiefs of not honoring pay deals.

The Union of Employees members had blocked access to classes as a protest over their situation.
