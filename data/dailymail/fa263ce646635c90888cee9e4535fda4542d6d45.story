Peter Crouch used one word to describe his Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired celebration on Saturday: 'ImPECcable.'

The Stoke striker tweeted his delight after scoring one of the goals in Stoke City's impressive 3-2 win against Arsenal, posting a picture comparing his body with the Real Madrid superstar's.

Ronaldo himself would have been happy with his exploits, scoring a hat-trick at the Bernabeu as the La Liga giants beat Celta Vigo 3-0.

But Crouch was keen to stress the all-round performance against the Gunners was one of Mark Hughes side's best.

'We had started well in previous games that I've been part off but that was a great start obviously,' he told Sky Sports.

'Three-nil up against Arsenal is an incredible first half for us and in the end it was a little bit backs to the wall but we managed to grind it out in the end.'

Arsenal have beaten Stoke at the Britannia Stadium just once in the Premier League.
