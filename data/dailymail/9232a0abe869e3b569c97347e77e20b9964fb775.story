A cruel woman convicted of keeping animals in squalid conditions has been banned from having pets - unless they are cats or dogs.

Adelaya Boardman, 33, kept ducks and ferrets in horrendous conditions in her filthy flat - including terrapins in her baths.

She also allowed her two pet cats to become infested with fleas and animals including a dog were forced to sleep and eat under piles of rubbish.

Cruel: A terrapin which was being kept in a bath in the woman's home

Shocked vets who discovered the animals unfed and sick, said her home was unfit for animals or humans, Plymouth Magistrates Court in Devon heard.

Boardman admitted a string of animal neglect charges and was banned from keeping animals for three years.

But she was allowed to keep her cats and dogs to help her state of mind.

She admitted three charges of failing to meet the needs of three ferrets by not providing a suitable diet, a proper environment and protection from a flea infestation.

Boardman, of Plymouth, pleaded guilty to a similar charge in failing to protect her cats Barney and Twinkle from fleas.

She also admitted failing to ensure the needs of a terrapin were met by not providing a suitable environment.

Magistrates banned her from keeping animals for three years but allowed to keep her cats and dogs because they 'help her cope' with her mental health problems.

John Wyatt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said an inspector and a vet visited Boardmanâ€™s flat in November last year.

He quoted from a report from the vet which said the 'flat was not suitable for human habitation, never mind animals'.

Boardman was served with an improvement notice giving her the chance to clean up the flat but the mess was not tidied.

Sarah Glanville, defending, said she had become 'overwhelmed' by the number of pets and their living conditions had become unacceptable.

But she said the dogs and cats helped her client cope with her mental health problems.

The court also heard that she also had horses, but these were in livery and were treated well.

District judge Maurice Champion gave her a conditional discharge.

He made no order for costs because of her limited means and her mental health condition.
