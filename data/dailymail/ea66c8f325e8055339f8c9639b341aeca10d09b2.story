Clutching a bunch of flowers, this little boy cuts a rather forlorn figure as he watches the Queen get into her car.

The reason? He was one of dozens of children left disappointed when the Queen broke with tradition by not accepting flowers in Sandringham yesterday.

More than 1,000 people, many of whom had travelled long distances, gathered outside St Mary Magdalene Church to cheer the Queen as she arrived for the morning service.

She usually accepts flowers from children every Sunday morning during her Christmas break in Norfolk.

But yesterday she paused only to wave to wellwishers as she emerged after the service ended at 11.45am.

The Queen was then driven straight back to Sandringham House in her maroon Bentley. One parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We drove more than 50 miles with our five-year-old daughter so she could present a small bouquet to the Queen.

'She had practised how to curtsey and it would have been a big moment for her so it was very disappointing to be told that the Queen was not receiving any flowers.

‘This policeman just told us that it was not happening today because the Queen was late for her family lunch on Christmas Day due to so many children giving her flowers.’

Another onlooker said: 'I have been 
coming to church services at Sandringham for 20 years and this is the 
first time that I can remember that the Queen has not accepted flowers.'

Normally
 children are allowed under a rope outside the 13th century church and 
line up by the steps so that they can file past the Queen and hand her 
their bouquets.

The Queen then usually gives the flowers to a policewoman who puts them in the back of her car.

On
 Christmas Day, an estimated 5,000 members of the public watched the 
royals at Sandringham, with children queuing up to present posies to the
 Queen.

So overwhelmed were
 the royals by the numbers, that the Duchess of Cambridge had to lend a 
hand and collected flowers from a second line.

It is thought that more than 100 children wanted to give flowers to the Queen on Christmas Day.

Yesterday Princess Anne, who was also at the church, accepted some bouquets on her mother’s behalf.

Last night, officials dismissed the suggestion that the Queen was rushing for lunch. It is understood she does not usually eat until later in the day.

A palace spokesman said: ‘Her Majesty
 is always grateful whenever people wish to present flowers and she 
accepted many flowers on Christmas Day.

‘However, she does not accept them in person on every occasion.’

Accompanying
 Her Majesty at the ceremony were senior royals, among them Prince 
Charles, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as the 
Earl and Countess of Wessex.

The
 Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne, dressed in a striking crimson 
ensemble, led the way from the main house on foot, with Prince Charles 
and 
Prince Edward walking behind.

Also
 appearing at the village church was the Earl and Countess of Wessex' 
daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, who wore the same green velvet-collared 
coat for the third year in a row, but Zara Phillips, Prince Harry and 
Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were nowhere to be seen. 

It is believed that the Duchess of Cornwall also left Sandringham House after Christmas Day to spend time with her family.

Instead,
 fashion fans had to content themselves with the sight of Sophie Wessex,
 elegant in a navy coat and matching trilby, and the monarch herself who
 wowed the crowd in a suitably regal purple coat and hat.

During the service, which was led by the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, prayers
 were said for people living in Syria, those serving in Afghanistan and 
the family of Captain Richard Holloway, the Royal Engineer killed in 
action two days before Christmas.

The congregation also prayed for those who suffered the effects of flooding and severe weather over the festive period.

She's just arrived at the age where little girls begin to choose their own clothes but it seems that Lady Louise Windsor, 10, is happier with old favourites.

The Queen's youngest granddaughter appeared at church in Sandringham this morning in a green tweed coat first worn to a Christmas service two years ago.

Since then, the garment has been on outings to Royal Ascot and to this year's Easter service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, as well as at subsequent festive services at Sandringham.

Clearly, the young Lady Louise resembles her famously thrifty grandmother in more ways than one.
