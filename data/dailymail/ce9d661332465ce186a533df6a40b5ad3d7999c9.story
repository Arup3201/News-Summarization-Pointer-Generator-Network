As the UK braces itself for the first cold snap of 2013, one corner of London has jumped the gun and prematurely turned itself into a winter wonderland.

The world's finest ice sculptors have gathered in Canary Wharf to exhibit their artistic skills.

Twelve teams from the UK, USA and other European partners are competing against each other in the London Ice Sculpting Festival.

The ice artists have been tasked with creating a piece to fit the festival's themes: The Wonders of the Universe and Infinity.

The results, so far, are dazzling, with designs so impressively intricate it is a shame their existence will soon melt away.

Sculptors were given a huge block of ice, specially shipped in from Belgium, before chiseling away against the clock.

The competition is split into both singles and doubles categories, while a free-style competition judged by the public allowed artists to create a sculpture without any time constraints.

Visitors to the free event took part in
ice-sculpting master classes, reveled in a snow-pit with
real snow and exhibit their own artistic flair on an interactive graffiti ice-wall.

Those who didn't mind get their hands chilly played ice chess, while a Northern Lights laser 
show is also planned.

Punters also enjoyed a range of festive treats at the food market, serving wintry fare such 
as alpine raclette, roasted chestnuts, hot chocolate, gluhwein and a hog
roast.

The three-day event, which began on Friday, is running for the fifth year.

Teams taking part travelled from France, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, Latvia, Belgium, Portugal and the US.
