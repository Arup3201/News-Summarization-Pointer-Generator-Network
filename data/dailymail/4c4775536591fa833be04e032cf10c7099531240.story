Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva has shown off his black eye suffered during their 2-0 win over Monaco to reach the Coupe de France semi-finals on Wednesday.

Silva took a knock from former Manchester United, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur striker Dimitar Berbatov that left the centre-back with a shiner but he got the last laugh.

PSG remain on course for the domestic treble in France as they made the final four thanks to David Luiz and Edinson Cavani's goals, and their skipper gave a thumbs up on Instagram.

Silva's caption read: 'Thanks for the messages! I would say to all friends and fans I'm fine! So this a little swollen and purple, but without pain!' 

Their 2-0 quarter-final win came just three days after Monaco and PSG played out a 0-0 stalemate at the Stade Louis II in Ligue 1.

PSG are preparing to face Lens in the league on Saturday before making the trip to London to verse Chelsea in their Champions League last-16 second leg tie.
