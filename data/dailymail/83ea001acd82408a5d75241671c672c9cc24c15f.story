Animal welfare at the Grand National is already under scrutiny after a horse died on the first day of action at the Aintree meeting.

Battlefront was pulled up - or withdrawn from competition - during the fourth race by jockey Katie Walsh and later collapsed and died.

The timing was particularly unfortunate for Ms Walsh, who rides one of the favourites for the Grand National on Saturday, after she defended the sport earlier this week, saying in a magazine interview that the horses were treated better than 'many children'.

Battlefront had cleared 10 fences in 
the John Smith's Fox Hunters' Steeple Chase, the first competitive test 
of significant course changes and new fence frames designed to improve 
safety.

The cause of his death has not been 
confirmed but it is thought Battlefront may have suffered a heart 
attack. A further five horses fell in the race, although none was 
significantly injured.

Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, 
said: 'The Aintree authorities and the British Horse Racing Authority 
have been claiming that major new safety measures and efficiencies would
eliminate much of the risk associated with racing on the Grand National
course.

'But today's Fox Hunters' Chase, in 
which Battlefront lost his life, was stomach-wrenchingly chaotic from 
start to finish Several horses fell or were pulled up, tired and 
potentially injured.

'It was both utterly depressing and served as confirmation that the Aintree authorities have got it badly wrong once again.'

Battlefront was the 23rd horse to die on the Grand National course since 2000, Animal Aid said.

Aintree bosses made significant 
alterations to the course after last year's big race was marred by the 
death of two horses, According To Pete and Synchronised.

That followed two fatalities in the 2011 race, Ornais and Dooney's Gate.

Old wooden fence frames have been replaced with 'Easyfix plastic birch', dressed with spruce.

Aintree said the new fences were 'kinder if the horse makes a mistake'. The height of the fences remains the same.

The start of the Grand National course has also been moved 90 yards further away from the grandstands and the crowds.

John Baker, regional director north 
west of Jockey Club Racecourses, expressed his sympathies to 
Battlefront's owners and trainers, adding: 'You can never remove all 
risk from horse racing, as with any sport.

'However, welfare standards are very 
high and equine fatalities are rare, with 90,000 runners each year with a
fatality rate of just 0.2%.

'The Grand National is woven into the 
fabric of British culture and, while the race is designed to be a unique
and tough test, Aintree ensures it is as fair and as safe as possible.

'Nothing has greater importance to 
Aintree than the safety and welfare of the horses and riders. The 
racecourse constantly strives to improve this further.'

More than 150,000 race goers will 
descend on Aintree over the three day meeting, building up to the 
world-famous Grand National steeplechase on Saturday.
