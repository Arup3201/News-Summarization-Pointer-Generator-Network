A Navy SEAL has pleaded guilty to conspiring to import 10 kilos of cocaine into the United States.

Angel Martinez-Ramos, 35, left active duty in 2010 and later served as a member of the Naval Reserves, according to documents obtained by Buzzfeed. He has served as a Navy SEAL for the past 14 years.

Miami DEA agents were tipped off by Bogota agents in December 2013 that an American military service member might transport drugs into the United States using a government passport, records say.

Martinez-Ramos was questioned by border patrol officers on Christmas Eve, the documents say, when he got off a flight from Aruba at Miami International Airport. He told officers he was traveling alone and was carrying a Travelpro suitcase.

However, officers identified and questioned his wife Bibiana Marcela Lopez-Correa, who was also on board, court records show. She, too, told officers she was flying by herself and said she was going to meet her husband 'David' - but confirmed Martinez-Ramos was actually her husband when asked.

Ten kilos of cocaine were found in a Totto carry-on suitcase left behind on the plane that Lopez-Carrea said belonged to her husband, packed as 'brick-shaped objects.' The drugs' street value is worth up to $350,000, according to Buzzfeed, and were allegedly given to Martinez-Ramos at the Aruba airport bathroom.

Lopez-Correa told officers her SEAL husband instructed her to stay on the plane until he called - and that if asked to say she was visiting her husband in Virginia. Martinez-Ramos reportedly took the Travelpro suitcase - but his wife left the other suitcase behind when she didn't receive a call.

Both were arrested, and authorities found drug testing kits, a money counter and a scale at Martinez-Ramos' home in Hampton, Virginia, records show. They also found grenades, firearms and almost 9,000 ammunition rounds.

Martinez-Ramos was charged with conspiracy to import a controlled substance, importation of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, documents show.

In March, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to import cocaine, Buzzfeed reports, and faces between 10 years and a life sentence. Lopez-Correa, however, has already pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 months in prison.
