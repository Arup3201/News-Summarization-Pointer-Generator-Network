Retailers are selling full-colour cardboard masks of shamed entertainer Rolf Harris on eBay and Amazon as well as in special festive Christmas Markets. 

One retailer has made almost £2,000 selling the masks on eBay for £2.20 each, while a second company on Amazon is charging £5.99. 

Purchasers buying the mask on eBay through funkybunky.co.uk can even collect Nectar points on their selection.

So far, 789 of the controversial masks have been sold on eBay alone.  

In Edinburgh, the cut-out masks were on sale at a special Christmas market on a festive stall which was only a few yards away from a children's carousel. 

The paedophile artist was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault in July and was jailed for almost six years.  

The Rolf Harris masks were on sale on a stall alongside others featuring cartoon characters, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp. 

Following complaints, organisers of Edinburgh's Christmas said the Rolf Harris masks had not been 'authorised for sale' and were 'removed with immediate effect'. 

Edinburgh councillor Norman Work said he was 'shocked' when he spotted the masks for sale on the stall before he made an official complaint. 

Neither the council, nor the market's organisers Underbelly had been aware of the controversial masks before Cllr Work's complaint. 

He said: 'It’s distasteful. Maybe a few years ago it would have been OK to wear a Rolf Harris Mask but not now.

'I was just going around the Christmas market, browsing the stalls and just happened to see it. I was surprised to see them on sale.

'You shouldn’t be selling anything like that. I wish I had asked the trader why they were selling these masks. That’s my only regret.

'I wondered what they were doing there. It’s a bit inappropriate. We are talking about someone who is in jail.

'It’s not really in the spirit of the Christmas market to be selling these things. You could see the funny side if someone was wearing a mask of the Queen or a politician, but it wouldn’t be funny if someone was wearing a Rolf Harris mask.'

Traders are supposed to submit a list of all goods being sold at the market to officials before they can trade. It is understood that the Rolf Harris mask was not included on the list by the trader.  

Bryan and Claire Laing, from Fife, who were visiting Edinburgh’s Christmas with one-year-old daughter Merryn, branded the masks 'tasteless'.

Bryan said: 'I didn’t think anybody could be so stupid.'

Another shopper, Tracey Malcolm, 24, from East Lothian, added: 'They shouldn’t be selling them, as far as I’m concerned.

'People could be walking about who have been the victims of abuse. They wouldn’t find this funny.'

A spokesman from Victim Support Scotland said: 'We help and provide support to over 200,000 victims and witnesses of crime a year.

'It is not in the best taste. People walking around in Rolf Harris masks will hardly help the recovery of the victims of Rolf Harris.

'It should be in mind that these masks will affect how victims of crime feel and their experiences of the ordeal.'

The trader manning the market stall declined to comment.

A spokesman for Underbelly stressed that the product was 'not authorised for sale'.

He said: 'We have also checked all of the other stalls, to ensure stock being sold is appropriate.

'We apologise for any offence that may have been caused by the entirely inappropriate sale of the masks by the trader.' 

An eBay spokesman said: 'eBay does not allow the sale of items that cause offence, or that relate to high profile criminals.

'We acted immediately when we heard these masks were being listed and removed them. Sellers that list offensive items may have both their buying and selling privileges restricted.'
