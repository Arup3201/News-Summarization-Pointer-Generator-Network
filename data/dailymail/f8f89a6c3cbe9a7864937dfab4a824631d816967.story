Thousands of dead starfish have washed up on a beach in Lincolnshire after a period of stormy weather.

Shocked photographer Simon Peck estimates that 4,000 starfish - along with whelks' eggs and pieces of shell - had surfaced on Cleethorpes beach.

Experts think that the animals were dislodged by rough waters in the recent wintry weather, with a similar incident happening at the same time last year.

Mass starfish strandings, known as ‘wrecks’, are not uncommon in Britain and typically occur once or twice a year as a result of storms.

Most starfish travel alone or in small groups, but congregate in their millions if a particular area of the seabed is rich in food or to reproduce.

Despite its name, the starfish is not a fish but an echinoderm and holds on to the ocean floor using their suction-cupped tube feet underneath their limbs.

They are therefore vulnerable during bad weather at sea as storms send strong currents through the beds where they are feeding, plucking them off their prey.

The currents then carry them to the shore, and dump them on the beach.

Although tides and strong currents are 
the most likely cause of this recent mass stranding, in a similar 
incident in Japan last year, starvation was to blame.

When hundreds of starfish stranded in southern Japan scientists said lack of food had made them too weak to hold on to the ocean floor.

Due to environmental hazards and overfishing of mussels, starfish are 
moving closer to the shore, becoming more vulnerable to tide and 
currents.

Richard Harrington, communications 
manager at the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'These are all common starfish Asterias 
rubens.

'The fact that there's what appear to be whelk eggs and different
shells in these pictures, both shallow water residents, along with the 
common starfish, would back up the likelihood that it is simply stormy 
weather that has caused this big strand.

'We were aware of a strand like this in the region at this time last year, too.

'Mass strandings of 
starfish and sea potatoes, a kind of sand-dwelling sea urchin, happen 
quite regularly in different parts of the coast.

'They seem to occur most in winter, and 
around sandy areas, when it's likely that rough seas in shallow water 
dislodge them in large numbers.

'Strandings
like this may be associated with breeding, indicated if all of the 
specimens that washed up are mature adults, but the common starfish 
tends to aggregate and spawn most in spring and summer - so that is 
unlikely.'

Millions of common starfish live in 
British seas. About the size of a hand, they are pinky orange when 
alive, but turn a bright orange when dry.

Their
ideal feeding ground is a mussel bed, where millions of starfish will 
congregate at any one time. And it's here where they are most at risk.

Violent
storms can send terrifically strong currents through the mussel beds 
where they are feeding, pluck them off their prey, carry them to the 
shore and dump thousands at a time on to a beach.

In
the past, some mass strandings have been blamed on overfishing - with 
dredgers used to scrape the sea floor for mussels dislodging starfish or
covering them with mud and sand.

Coastal confusion: Similar 'mass strandings' have happened in the past - mostly in winter, around sandy areas

Strange: A similar stranding was seen last year. Sometimes they happen in Spring during breeding season

Whelk eggs and shells were also washed ashore at Cleethorpes

Conservationists said 'strandings' have happened before

It's thought rough seas in shallow water may have dislodged them
