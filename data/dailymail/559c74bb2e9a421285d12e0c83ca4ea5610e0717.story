Two brothers have broken a record for growing Britain's heaviest vegetable - with a pumpkin weighing in at 1,884 pounds.

Twins Ian and Stuart Paton, 53, previously held the record until it was beaten by a pumpkin last year that weighed 1,520 pounds.

However, the Patons, from Pennington, Hampshire, reclaimed the record yesterday at an annual weigh-in of Britain's biggest pumpkin.

And amazingly, they smashed the record with their enormous 4.5ft tall pumpkin, which has a circumference of 17ft and 4in.

Grower Ian said: 'It's absolutely enormous.'

Moments before they smashed the record, farmer Mark Baggs from Dorset thought he had set it himself with a massive 1,582 pound vegetable.

Ian said: 'Mark is a great friend of ours - we have known him for over ten years - and it was actually him who took our British record last year.

'When his went on the scales we though it was huge and there couldn't be much in it.

'But it's brilliant to take another step closer to the world record. Mark is chuffed to bits for us.'

The record for the world's biggest pumpkin is  2,032 pounds and the brothers are confident they can top it one day.

The twins placed it on the back of their truck and transported it to the annual competition at the Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley, Hampshire.

Over 1,000 people attended the event in aid of the Jubilee Sailing Trust as 25 competitors entered their prized pumpkin assets.

Ian added: 'The secret behind it is that we feed them well, if you want to grow anything you've got to feed it right.

'If you feed your pumpkin properly then you're going to end up with a big one.

'We want to get the world record at one point and that's what we do it for. I think we will get there in the end.'

The twins kept their record-breaker at a garden and plant nursery which they own in Pennington.

They planted their pumpkin - the sole survivor of a group of seven - in April and have carefully nurtured it since.

Ian said: 'We just lost two of them because of soft spots in them - the competition rules are really tough.

'We had to throw away about 4,500 pounds of pumpkin because of it.'
