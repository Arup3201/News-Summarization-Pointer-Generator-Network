Rod Addamo just might be Australia's most dedicated fan boy. The Melbourne-based tiler and father-of-two has been an avid follower of the Marvel universe since he was a child, and is now living the dream in his very own 'Marvel museum' home.

'It encompasses all areas of my life really,' Rod told Daily Mail Australia. 'From our home to the kids to my work and everything in between. It's a real labour of love.'

Having fallen in love with comic books at the age of five, Rod has spent the rest of his life collecting, obsessing, and finding ways of incorporating the comics into every area of his life.

Rod lost his father as a teenager, and as the eldest child it fell to him to help his mother raise his brothers and sisters. He found that the Marvel universe became more to him than simply a hobby- it became a creed to live by.

'I had to be the man of the house,' explained Rod. 'The creator of the Marvel universe, Stan Lee, put so much pathos into his tales,'

'They taught me about responsibility and about how to do the right thing. I was able to take these lessons and put them into practice in helping out my mum.'

In 2011, Rod married his wife Steph in an elaborate Marvel-themed wedding. 

Taking his fandom to new heights, Rod commissioned a South African artist to design invitations based on a 1980's Spiderman Annual in which Peter Parker marries his long-time love Mary Jane.

'It's an iconic cover, and we made it our own. We used it for the invitations, and created an album for the guests too,'

'I asked the artist to recreate it with myself and Steph as Peter and Mary Jane, and we had all our favourite Marvel characters in the background as wedding guests.'

Having planned their honeymoon around that year's Comic-Con in New York, Rod started trawling online forums and discovered that the creator of Marvel, Stan Lee, had been announced as a special guest. 

'I was so excited,' said Rod. 'I was chatting in a forum with other like-minded fans, and explained to them the story of my dad's passing and how much the Marvel universe had meant to me at that time, and the way it has impacted on my life,' 

'Little known to me, one of the members knew Stan Lee's agency, and told them all about my story. They got in contact with me and asked if I'd like to meet him and spend some time together.'

The opportunity to meet the man responsible for the world that has meant so much to him was incredible. 

'To be able to meet him as an adult, shake his hand, and say thank you to him was just amazing,' said Rod. 

'I've actually met him six times now, and I think I can almost call him a friend. Each time he comes to Australia, his agency contacts me and asks if I'd like to come along. I've been so blessed.'

Rod has also met many of the other writers and creators of the Marvel universe, including Chris Claremont and Mike McKone.

Most recently Rod met Sebastian Stan, who plays Winter Soldier in the latest  Captain America film, at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con.

It's not only Rod that loves Marvel though. While wife Steph 'has come to love it over time', their two children were involved right from birth.

The couple named their daughter Lila Rose, 3, after X-men character Lila Cheney, and their son Logan James, 1, after the character Wolverine. 

'They've seen the comic series and I'll introduce them to the movies when they're older,' Rod said.

'All their plates and cups are Marvel. It makes it easy for people to buy presents, so they have Spiderman toothbrushes and X-men pyjamas and other Marvel clothes. All our birthday parties are Marvel themed too- we already have the decorations!' 

'It's a real all-in family love now. My friends call our house the 'Marvel Museum'- we've got statues and figurines, posters and costumes, all the movies, comics, novels, and plush toys for all of us.'

Even the business that Rod co-owns with his brother is dedicated to Marvel. The roof tiling company is called Marvellous Tiling, with the company's logo and van designed with silhouettes of the different characters.

'It's everywhere I go,' said Rod. 'Whether I'm at home with the kids and my wife, or at work, it's a constant in my life,'

'It's a lot of work keeping ahead of the curve in terms of getting the newest collectible and seeing all the movies but's never actually work. It's always fun, and an experience that I get to share with my family'. 

'Creeds like Spiderman's "with great power comes great responsibility" really resonate with me. Ideas about doing good and doing the right thing have made such an impact on my life,' 

'Even though the Marvel characters are 2D images on paper or on screen you can take what they model and apply that to real life,'

'Like most people I gravitate towards heroes, but whilst the broad superhero universe is about adventure and fun, it's also about teaching you about life and giving you a code to live by.' 

'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is out now on Blu-ray and DVD.
