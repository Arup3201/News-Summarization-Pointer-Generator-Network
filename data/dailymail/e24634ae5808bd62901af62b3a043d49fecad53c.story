Sony unveiled its Xperia Z3 smartphone in September with the bold claim that its battery lasts an almost unprecedented two days.

And while manufacturers have a tendency to exaggerate about such features, reviews of the device suggest Sony wasn’t lying.

Initial testing revealed that not only does the device last, on average, for 48 hours before it needs charging again, this is the case even when streaming music, making calls and watching videos.

Sony’s claims were made using a so-called Typical Smartphone User usage profile.

This involved using the device for approximately five hours over a 24-hour period, for a range of ‘typical usage scenarios’.

Dimensions: 146 x 72 x 7.3mm

Weight: 152g

Screen size: 5.2"

Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 

Battery: 3,100mAh Li-ion

Internal storage: 16GB (with expandable storage up to 128GB) 

Rear camera: 20.7MP

Front-facing camera: 2.2MP

They included calling, texting, surfing the web, checking social networks, playing games, using the camera, listening to music and streaming video.

In tests, the phone’s default settings were applied, which included setting the display brightness to 100 nits, with battery stamina mode turned off.

Nits are used to determine the brightness and readability of a display, and the Xperia ranges from four to 713 – meaning 100 is towards the dimmer end, but not at the minimum.

During personal tests, the phone lasted for 45 hours before it ran out of energy completely.

A number of other tech sites have also managed up to two-day battery life during tests.

Engadget’s James Trew, for example, said: ‘The Xperia Z3 performs well and has epic battery life.

'In my personal usage, I regularly got two days of full use, or so near to two days that I'm loath to mark it down for the odd 10pm finish on the second day.’

By comparison, the battery on Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) has been improved to last more than 24 hours on average. Sony's Xperia Z2 typically lasts 1.4 days, based on official tests

While, Michael Sawh from Trusted Reviews added: ‘You can comfortably get a couple of days use out of this and that’s without tapping into the battery saving power management modes.

‘It will push on further if you don’t have that brightness cranked up to the max as well.’

By comparison, the battery on Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus has been improved to last more than 24 hours on average.

‘At Sony Mobile, "flagship" now means offering a choice to consumers of enjoying a large screen Xperia Z3 for immersive entertainment or a more compact, lighter Xperia Z3 Compact that doesn't ask you to compromise on features,’ said Kunimasa Suzuki, President and chief executive officer at Sony Mobile Communications.

‘Consumers demand and deserve greatness from their smartphone - in design, camera and battery life.

‘That's precisely what we aim to deliver with Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact.’
