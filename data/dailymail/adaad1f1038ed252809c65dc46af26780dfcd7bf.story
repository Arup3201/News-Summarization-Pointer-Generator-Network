The last wooden whaleship in the world made a triumphant homecoming as it arrived in the port where it was originally launched 173 years ago, as part of its first voyage for more than a century.

The Charles W. Morgan, the last surviving ship of America's 19th century whaling fleet, arrived at New Bedford, in Massachusetts, yesterday as part of its historic three month tour of New England ports.

The journey, dubbed The 38th Voyage, started on May 17 following a five-year restoration at Mystic Seaport, costing $10.6million.

The 113-foot vessel was welcomed home yesterday as it arrived in New Bedford, where it first set sail from in July 1841.

The 173-year-old ship is now due to remain docked at the New Bedford State Pier until July 6. It will officially open to the public on Saturday.

The ship plans further stops at Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Boston, this summer before heading back to Mystic at the end of its voyage.

The ship still has 18 per cent of its original wood, including the keel first laid in New Bedford, although it has also been fitted with some more modern appliances, including pumps, generators and lighting.

The ship, which is not equipped with a motor, is being accompanied by a tug to aid it when it is not under sail.

According to SouthCoastToday.com, upon the ship's arrival to New Bedford, Mystic Seaport President Steve White told the crew: 'The significance of the day is not lost on any of us. You were extraordinary.'

The Morgan is America's second oldest ship which remains afloat - only the U.S.S. Constitution is older.

According to Destination New Bedford, the ship embarked on a total of 37 voyages over an 80-year whaling career between 1841 and 1921.
