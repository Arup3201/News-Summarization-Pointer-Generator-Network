Burglars should be given longer prison sentences because 'numerous' criminals just re-offend while on parole, one of Britain's top judges said today.

Michael Stokes QC said offenders were being granted parole well before they served half of their sentences and used that time to commit further crimes.

The outspoken senior judge, who sits at Nottingham Crown Court, said multiple offenders should be treated in the same way as sex offenders and violent criminals.

He is now demanding the courts are given the option of handing out extended sentences - which currently only apply to serious crimes - to repeat burglars.

Judge Stokes called for guidelines to be altered to give him powers to jail criminals for longer if they had more than five or six burglaries on their record.

He said: 'Dwelling house burglaries are always serious, especially when the offence is committed at night when the householder is asleep in bed.

'In such cases there is always the risk of confrontation taking place.

'In my experience, offenders who commit such offences not infrequently continue to offend after being released from prison.

'I have seen numerous cases of defendants with five, six or seven previous convictions for dwelling house burglary.

'It is a matter of concern that there have been occasions when such individuals have been granted temporary parole from prison, well before they have served even one half of their sentences, and use that period of release to commit further burglaries.'

The Labour Government introduced a 'three strikes and you're out' policy on domestic burglary with mandatory three-year custodial sentences on the third conviction.

But sentences are often reduced if the defendant pleads guilty and often they are released after serving just half their sentence.

Judge Stokes, the Midlands' most senior member of the judiciary, is calling for multiple offenders to be forced to apply for parole before being released.

His comments come after Philip Kelly, 33, who had 46 previous convictions burgled a house after leaving prison.

Kelly, of no fixed address, was released on parole just 13 months into a four-year sentence but committed several serious burglaries and failed to return to prison.

He was finally jailed for five years on June 25 this year to run consecutively to the four-year sentence originally imposed in 2012.

Nottinghamshire Police Inspector Nick Waldron said he believes burglars should serve more of their first sentence to act as a deterrent.

He said: 'It's difficult to say whether releasing a repeat burglar will result in a spike in burglaries.

'We have an integrated offender management team that manage repeat offenders so the possibility of re-offending is something we are aware of but we do manage it and it has proved successful.

'However, I would like to see harsher sentencing.

'If people are committing that many times then that's five or six different victims and burglars should be given the appropriate sentence to reflect that level of impact.'

*In 2009 judge Stokes slammed the CPS for taking too long to bring juvenile offenders before the courts.
