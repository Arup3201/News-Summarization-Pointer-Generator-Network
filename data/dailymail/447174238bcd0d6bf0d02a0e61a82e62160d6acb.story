The future of virtual reality took a very real - and large - step forward yesterday in an unlikely corner.

Marriott hotels has unveiled a new travel booth in New York  where guests can explore the black sand beaches of Hawaii or the top of London's Tower 42, without buying so much as a bus ticket.

In one of the first premium virtual reality applications outside of the gaming and entertainment industry, Marriott is taking the immersive experience to new heights by allowing users to feel sensory elements such as heat, wind and mist  as well as seemingly 'seeing' new locations in front of them.

The ‘Teleporter’ is made using Oculus Rift technology and is child’s play to use. 

Users stand in a phone-booth like structure, put on a virtual headset and wireless headphones, and then are ‘teleported’ to the destination for a 100-second 'experience'.

Built-in 4D technology means the user physically feels different parts of the environment, such as temperature and moisture.

There’s pneumatic pumps embedded in the booth's floor, misting nozzles in the walls, heat fans in the ceiling and floor, a ‘scent dispenser’ and a 1000-watt amplifier.

Once you  virtually ‘land’ on the beach, pumps in the floor create the cushioned feeling of sand, users feel 80-degree warmth against their skin, a gentle sea breeze and ocean mist.

The brand has partnered with Relevent, who brought on board Academy Award-winning Framestore - the company who engineered ‘Ascend the Wall’, a Game of Thrones virtual reality experience that lets you ascend the infamous Wall from the series - to develop the booth's visual effects.

New York's Marriott Hotel unveiled the new technology and it will travel to other locations throughout November

‘Marriott needed to build credibility with younger travelers,’  Michael Dail, the company’s VP of global brand marketing told Wired.

‘The tech has been there for a while, the application has been there, but now that it’s becoming accessible and mainstream, we wanted to be the first to jump out there.

‘We wanted something more immersive, more experiential, that helps people connect with that feeling of what travel is really about.’

Earlier this year, online virtual website Second Life CEO Philip Rosedale said that it won't be too long before people purchase virtual reality property for their own homes.

For now, the Teleporter  will be travelling around the US at selection locations throughout November.

Marriott hope this is just the beginning. If someone is planning to go on holiday, they could use this technology to check out different locations before booking.

Dail said: ‘We want to take things to the next level and we are thinking ahead about the future of travel.’
