The U.S. government has spent $3million on eight inflatable boats that were intended to be used in Afghanistan but never once saw water.

The landlocked nature of Afghanistan- not to mention the fact that they have been sitting in a Naval warehouse in Virginia ever since they were purchased in 2010- are two of the biggest reasons why they went unused.

The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction does not specify why the boats cost so much more than their American counterparts either.

Never made it over: Eight of these inflatable boats were ordered to deter smuggling along a river that separates Afghanistan and Uzbekistan but they were deemed unnecessary nine months after they were bought

The $3million price tag breaks down to $375,000 per boat, and The Washington Post reports that similar inflatable boats in the U.S. tend to cost about $50,000.

'We don't even have a list from (the Defense Department) of where they spent the money. We have no centralized list of where the taxpayer money went in Afghanistan,' special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction John F. Sopko told CBS.

'It's like you gave your credit card to your teenage daughter or son and then you just never looked at the bills.'

The boats were originally intended to patrol the Amu Darya River that separates Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.

Small section: Afghanistan is a landlocked nation but there is a strip of a river that separates it from Uzbekistan that, at one point, was considered necessary to patrol

Unanswered questions: Similar boats (like this one) reportedly cost about $50,000 but the ones the military ordered somehow cost $375,000 each

General Harold Greene told The Washington Post reports that they were intended 'to deter smuggling and illegal entry into Afghanistan' but they didn't see much action on that front.

U.S. officials and NATO commanders deemed that the boats were not needed only nine months after they were bought without giving any specific reasons as to why, so the boats ended up staying in a warehouse in a Yorktown, Virginia naval base.

'The list of unanswered questions is particularly troubling given the fact... that this program had been an important national security priority for the Afghan National Security Forces prior to its cancellation,' Mr Sopko wrote in an official letter to military officials, which was then shared with The Washington Post.

He expects the boats to be stripped for parts or 'sold for pennies on the dollar'.

The boats are far from the only instance of an expensive budget item that went unused.

Ghost town: A two-story facility in Helmand Province will now likely be demolished because American troops are being pulled out of the region, and it will be too expensive for the fledgling Afghan army to maintain

Seats to fill: The command and control facility at Camp Leatherneck in southern Afghanistan cost $34million

More than $600million was spent on specialized aircrafts that stayed on runways in Kabul and Germany.

One of the clearest signs of waste, however, was highlighted in another SIGAR report last summer, where it detailed how $34million was spent on a state-of-the-art building on a base in southern Afghanistan that will never be used.

The building was never be used by American troops but is too expensive for Afghan forces to maintain, so it will be levelled as a result.

'This is an example of what is wrong with military construction in general â€” once a project is started, it is very difficult to stop,' Mr Sopko wrote in a scathing report released last June.

'One senior U.S. military official told me that this facility was designed for a military division that was never deployed and, subsequently, a decision was made not to construct the facility, but inexplicably the building construction started and is now complete.'
