Insects were considered a delicacy among Roman aristocrats, but weren’t quite as well received by a young woman who found one in her Marks and Spencer dinner.

Jenna Murray, 29, bought the £3 supper of smoked mackerel, new potatoes and beetroot after work from her local store in Camden, north London - and it contained a dead beetle.

Single designer Miss Murray had bought the meal from the Delicious and Nutritious range. It came with a creamy mustard and dill dressing and was ready to cook.

Miss Murray had eaten half of it when her fork uncovered the inch-long black bug lying under the remainder. She claims she leapt from the table in disgust, dashed to her bathroom and vomited.

She returned the food with bug to the store the following day where she was given her money back, and has since received a £15 voucher as a goodwill gesture from the store while they investigate.

Miss Murray said: ‘It was horrible - a beetle at least an inch long. It was ironic that it was part of their “Delicious and Nutritious” range. I was midway through it when I found it and I was physically sick.

‘I took it back as soon as I could the next day. To be honest I still felt sick and didn't want to be in there for any longer than necessary.

‘They took my details and said they would send it off to head office. I've not been able to eat anything from Marks and Spencer since.’

A Marks and Spencer spokesman told MailOnline: 'We’re very sorry to hear about our customer’s complaint. Quality is extremely important to us and we are working with our supplier to investigate how this happened.'
