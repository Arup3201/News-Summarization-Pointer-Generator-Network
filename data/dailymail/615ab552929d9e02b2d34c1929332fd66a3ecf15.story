Maybe even the criminals enjoy a slower pace of life in the countryside.

Because this new police vehicle, a tractor with a top speed of just 20mph, would not be much use in pursuit. Unless, that is, the chase takes place across a muddy field.

With flashing blue lights and police paintwork on the bonnet, Britain’s most rural police force yesterday unveiled their new patrol vehicle.

Dyfed Powys Police hope the machine will improve their relationshops with rural communities in Mid and West Wales.

Inspector Tim Davies said: ‘We're very impressed with this new piece of kit.

‘Engagement with our rural communities is important to us, and we want people to come and discuss any concerns they may have about rural crime.’

Officers will use the vehicle to visit farmers working their land and to access more remote parts of their policing area.

The tractor, it is hoped, will help police fight back against criminals who target farmers for their fuel supplies, livestock and high-tech machinery.

In the last year thefts of farm machinery doubled and rural crime cost the UK economy more than £40million a year.

Dyfed-Powys Police have set up a centre of excellence to improve rural policing after discovering the countryside was being neglected compared to cities.

The force covers the largest police area in England and Wales – but has only 1,183 officers, the third smallest in England and Wales.

The New Holland tractor, on loan to the force from a farm machinery company, was unveiled at the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show in Builth Wells, Mid Wales.

Schoolboy Morgan Thompson, 13, of Merthyr Tydfil, said: ‘It is awesome – it may not be fast but it would frighten anyone being chased by it.

‘It looks great when the lights are flashing.’
