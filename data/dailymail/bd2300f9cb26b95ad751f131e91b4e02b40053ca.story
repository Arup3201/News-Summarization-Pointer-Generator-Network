When it comes to keeping our cool on the roads, it seems we're actually a bunch of hot-heads who do anything but keep calm.

From drivers who don't indicate, inconsiderate motorists who tailgate others and those who treat the roads like a racetrack, it seems there are many things that grind our gears. 

New statistics show that nearly half of all drivers have experienced a road rage incident, while ten per cent of people revealed they have been in a collision with a cyclist.

A new survey has revealed that Australian drivers are a bunch of hot heads on the roads

Canstar Blue spoke to 2000 Australian drivers and their research also discovered that nearly half of drivers wish they didn't have to share the road with their two-wheeled nemesis on bicycles.

And on top of losing our tempers behind the wheel apparently we don't like to stick to the road rules either.

The number of drivers that regularly exceed the speed limit is 23 percent, while drivers who drive too slow are also unfavourable people to share the asphalt with.

On top of all that it seems we're not afraid to voice our concerns as a third of motorists revealed they've had another driver jump out of their car to confront them.

One in ten motorists said they have been involved in a collision with a pushbike rider

Almost a quarter of drivers said they have left their car to confront another driver

Almost a quarter admitted to doing the yelling, with 22 per cent saying they had pulled over to lose it at a fellow driver. 

The survey also revealed we're a dishonest bunch, with one in ten people admitting their have hit a parked car and fled the scene without leaving any of their insurance details.

Many passive-aggressive or just downright rude notes have gone viral online when posted by disgruntled drivers who discovered their car had been damaged in their absence.

More than a third of drivers say bike riders are their biggest pet peeve on the road

Nearly a third of people say another driver has got out of their car to terrorise them

Motorcyclists also made it into the top frustrations for drivers trying to get from point A to point B, with 17 percent saying their presence on the road was a pet peeve.

Other things that get drivers revved up are drivers who don't keep left unless overtaking, motorists using their phones to call or text while behind the wheel and the lack of a courtesy wave when being let in.

Aggressive drivers, people who are incapable of adjusting to weather conditions such as the rain, those who can't merge and others who simply drive downright dangerously also irk many motorists.
