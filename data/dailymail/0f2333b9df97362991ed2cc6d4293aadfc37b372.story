It's not everyday you hear about a wallaby who went for a dip in the ocean let alone gotten caught in a rip.

But that's exactly what happened at Brawley Point on the south coast of New South Wales.

Two surfers, Scott Dennis and Jason Finlay were in the water surfing when they spotted what looked like an animal in the water.

The surfers thought it might have been a seal or a small sea lion but another surfer had gotten a closer look and informed them it was actually a wallaby that had been caught in a rip.

The surfers made their way to rescue the exhausted wallaby wrapping it in a jet ski jacket.

The rescue was captured on camera by surf photographer Simon Punch who happened to be on the beach at the same time.

'The wallaby was getting dumped in the waves and sucked out further. He was stuck right where the waves were breaking in the rip,' Mr Punch told The Daily Telegraph.'After he hopped away it was a pretty good feeling, we just looked at each other with smiles on our faces. I donâ€™t think any of us had seen anything like that before,' Mr Punch said.After some recovery time the lucky wallaby left the shore and his rescuers.
