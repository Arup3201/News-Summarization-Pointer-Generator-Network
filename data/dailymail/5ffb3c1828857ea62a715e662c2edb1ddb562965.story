Brothel madam: Jenine Jones was caught red-handed when police officers found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown

Her wealthy home counties clients might have expected their horse riding instructor to take a second job for extra income.

But Jenine Jones’s choice of alternative business is probably not what they had in mind.

The 41-year-old was found guilty of helping to run a seedy brothel above a motorbike shop.

To supplement her equestrian earnings, she worked as a madam in the evenings, a court heard, taking phone calls from punters and gathering takings of up to £400 a day from Eastern European prostitutes using the premises.

The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000.

Jones was caught red-handed when police officers raided the building and found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown. She told them: ‘Thank God it’s you, I thought we were being robbed.’

Reading Crown Court heard that Jones, who is a woman of previous good character, helped run the brothel in Newbury, Berkshire, with owner Meinir Kirlew, 51.

The illicit business attracted up to 20 clients a day after advertisements were placed in the local papers promising ‘relaxing and unhurried massages’.

Prostitutes from other countries including Latvia and the Czech Republic paid £20 per client to Kirlew for use of the premises.

Jones updated the owner by text message, telling her how many clients there had been and where she had hidden the day’s takings.

One read: ‘Had 19, just off, see you next week.’

Another said: ‘Had a complaint about Anna today about poor service.’

A reply from Kirlew to Jones read: ‘Ok hun, did you leave the money and where?’

The response: ‘Yes bottom of sink bin.’

On the day of the police raid, November 9 last year, officers found two prostitutes and one client surrounded by pornographic material, oils, towels and baby wipes.

Brothel: A number of Eastern European prostitutes were found to be working above a shop in Newbury

Prosecutor Rebecca Austin told the 
court: ‘In the lounge of the flat was a woman. She stated she was 
working as a prostitute one day a week.

‘She
earned an average £200 a day. In her make-up bag was a bundle of cash. 
She explained that the money was her takings from the clients.’

‘Officers
went upstairs. In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a 
state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a 
room.’

Jones, who had 
panicked and climbed on to the roof, surrendered herself to the officers
but claimed she was just a weekly cleaner.

Property: The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000

A total of £680 in cash was seized from the brothel along with eight mobile phones.

'In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a room'

Rebecca Austin, prosecuting

Jones,
wearing a blue flowery dress, black tights, and dark heels as she stood
in the dock, was convicted of assisting in the management of a brothel.

Summing up the case, Judge
Angela Morris said: ‘When you consider what was found at the house, 
what was contained in the  interview and what was contained in her text 
messages it might be this amounts to someone who was doing more than 
menial tasks.’

Kirlew, from Cardiff, had already pleaded guilty to managing a brothel. Both women will be sentenced next month.
