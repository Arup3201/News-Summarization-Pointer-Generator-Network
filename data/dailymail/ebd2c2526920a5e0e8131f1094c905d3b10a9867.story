A cheating newlywed whose plot to kill her husband with a teenage lover became the subject of a Hollywood movie has made a new bid for freedom.

Pamela Smart, of New Hampshire, was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, being an accomplice to first-degree murder and witness tampering in March 1991 at the age of 22 over the death of her 24-year-old husband.

She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole but all the while has maintained she had nothing to do with plotting his murder. For the past two decades, she has lost all her legal appeals. 

Ms Smart, 47, now hopes that a new documentary examining the media fervor at her trial - which she believes swayed the public and ultimately the jury's decision - will convince New Hampshire authorities to allow her a parole hearing.

Smart was just 22 years old and newly married, when she began a torrid affair with a student, William Flynn.

He was a 15-year-old enrolled in a self-esteem course she had volunteered to teach at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, where she was the media services director.

Flynn testified against his lover and said Smart wanted her husband dead so she wouldn't lose her condo, furniture and dog in a divorce.

The teenager testified that Smart helped plan her husband's killing to make it look like a burglary. 

He said she persuaded him and his friends to kill her husband so she and Flynn could be together - and she also stood to gain $140,000 from insurance on Gregg Smart's life. 

Mr Smart was shot to death at the couple's Derry condo. According to testimony, a friend of Flynn's, Patrick Randall, held a knife to Smart's throat during the attack.

Flynn - after asking God for forgiveness - fired a .38-caliber revolver. 

Two other friends, Vance Lattime Jr. and Raymond Fowler, were in a getaway car.

Smart died a week before he and Pamela could celebrate their wedding anniversary. Smart has claimed that at the time of his death, the couple were trying to repair their relationship after he cheated on her first. 

The other three teens were convicted of murder conspiracy or accomplice charges. They all took pleas in return for reduced sentences and testified against Smart. 

The case was tabloid fodder, decades ahead of  cases such as Casey Anthony and Jodi Arias, which have captivated the public.

Smart was dubbed the 'ice princess' during her trial and perceived as a self-absorbed woman with no friends. She believes that her public persona contributed the guilty verdict.

She told NBC this week, from maximum-security Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York, that she had been tried in the 'court of public opinion'.

Despite the glut of local and nationwide media coverage before jury selection in the state, the presiding judge, Douglas Gray, ruled against sequestering the jurors, according to NBC. 

Smart, who has achieved two masters' degrees while in prison and works as an HIV/AIDS counselor, added: 'I can either just give up or I can live, so if I'm going to live - which I am - then I have to do the best I can to fight the case, to stay healthy, to stay alive and to stay positive.'

The 47-year-old also spoke to NBC about her difficult time behind bars. She was beaten so badly by two fellow inmates in 1996 that she was left with a broken eye socket and metal plate in her face.

She has claimed that she was raped by a corrections officer.  

Smart's trial spawned to books and movies, including the 1995 film To Die For, which starred Nicole Kidman as a TV personality who enlists three teens, including a lover played by Joaquin Phoenix, to kill her husband.

Flynn was moved to a minimum-security prison in November 2014 in Warren, Maine, as part of a work-release program. 

He could be freed later this year along with Randall who is also eligible for parole in June. The other men are already free, 

But the new HBO documentary, 'Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart', has given the prisoner new hope as it focuses on the intense media coverage of the 14-day trial. 

For now, New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan remains unconvinced, according to a statement made by her spokesperson, who said she believes that Smart 'had been justly and fairly convicted'.
