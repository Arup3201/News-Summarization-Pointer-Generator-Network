New Wimbledon hero Nick Kyrgios pulled off a sensational victory over Rafael Nadal on Tuesday night — pushed by the desire to prove his mother wrong.

The 19-year-old Australian explained: ‘Last night (Monday) I noticed that my mum had said in an interview she thought Rafa was too good. It made me a bit angry and spurred me on.’

Kyrgios was given a raucous ovation by the Centre Court crowd after beating Spain’s stunned world No 1 Nadal 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3.

Asked what message he was now going to send to his mother Noraila, who is Malaysian, he replied: ‘I will just text her a smiley face.’

The huge-serving Kyrgios has spent most of this year playing on the humble Challenger circuit, and his world ranking of 144 was so low that he needed a wildcard entry to get into these Championships.

Yet now he is in the last eight and plays another big server in Canadian Milos Raonic for a place in the semi-finals.

John McEnroe, three times men’s singles champion, said that he might even be ready to win Wimbledon now as bookmakers cut Kyrgios’ odds to 14-1.

‘We’ve been waiting for this for a while,’ McEnroe said in his commentary for the BBC.

‘We keep saying, “Who’s the next guy?” and I think we found that guy right now. That was absolutely stunning, to see what he did to the world No 1. How did he keep that up?

‘He actually had this feeling about him... that he absolutely believed he was going to win this match. He’s acting to me like he can win this tournament.

Shock: Nadal was beaten 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 out on Centre Court

The last guy I saw like this is Boris Becker. No fear whatsoever — "no matter what comes my way I’m going to be better than them”.’

Kyrgios said he did not want to stop at beating twice-champion Nadal. ‘It’s been the best week of my life,’ he added. ‘I’m not feeling pressure, just the motivation to keep going.

‘I’m a normal kid like any 19-year-old who likes to play on his Xbox. The big stage is something I thrive on.

'At 5-3 in the fourth the crowd erupted and you think of all the hard work you’ve done, I love that feeling. I believe in myself.

‘My serve got me over the line. I’m just going to give the people what they want, put a bit of a show out there.’

Nadal said: ‘When you have an opponent who decides to serve like that and to hit every ball very strong, you are in trouble.’
