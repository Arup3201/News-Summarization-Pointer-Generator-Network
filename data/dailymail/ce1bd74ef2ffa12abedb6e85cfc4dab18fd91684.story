Jurors in the trial of a mommy blogger accused of poisoning her son to death by injecting him with salt were shown harrowing video Monday in which the boy writhes and screams in pain in a New York hospital bed days before his death.

Prosecutors contend Lacey Spears gave a fatal dose of sodium to 5-year-old Garrett in January 2014 at Nyack Hospital after years of blogging about his health struggles.

In one clip played by Assistant DA Christine Hatfield, Spears is seen walking Garrett to the bathroom while holding his stomach feeding tube, which prosecutors allege she used to poison him.

After they return to the room, the clip shows Garrett keeled over on his bed in pain as Spears fails to tend to him until a nurse appears in the room, according to lahoud.com. 

Horrific: Lacey Spears wept as a court watched video of what prosecutors allege shows her 5-year-old son Garrett writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt prior to his January 2014 death

Sad: Spears is seen here with her son Garrett. Video shown in court Monday allegedly shows her taking the boy from his bed to the hospital room bathroom, where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt

Recorded by an EEG camera used to monitor the boy's movements along with his brain activity, the camera shows Garrett acting normally during his first day in the hospital, where his mother took him complaining he was exhibiting seizures.

When she learned her son would be released from the hospital because he was not showing any signs of seizures, she gave him the fatal dose, prosecutors say.

Jurors watched video taken January 19, 2014 in which five hospital staffers surround Garrett as he flails around. There is no audio with the video, but prosecutors claim he was screaming in pain.

Spears broke down and began to weep as the videos were shown. Two jurors were seen to wipe away tears as well, reports lohud.com.

'It seems to go against nature,' the prosecutor said in her opening statements. 'But Lacey Spears is not like most people.' She said Spears enjoyed the 'attention and sympathy' she received from having a sick child.

Garrett was flown to Maria Fareri Chidren's Hospital in Valhalla, where he died days later. 

Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, had documented Garnett's declining health on social media. She wiped away a tear as the prosecutor spoke.

Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old Spears poisoned her son.

He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question 'Why?'''

Lloyd told jurors they would see hospital video showing mother and son twice going into the bathroom and then see Garnett become ill soon afterward both times. He died of high sodium levels that caused swelling of the brain.

But the bathroom is out of the range of the camera, and Riebling noted that no one saw Spears feed her son salt.

He said, in context, Spears' actions show a caring mother.

He implored the jurors to 'set aside emotion.'

Spears is accused of killing her 5-year-old son Garnett by feeding him salt through a stomach tube and then calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, prosecutors said. During that time, he is seen writhing and screaming on a hospital video camera

Riebling also appeared to blame the hospital, in the New York suburbs near the Spearses' Chestnut Ridge home, noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected.

The defense lawyer said the prosecution case was 'riddled with reasonable doubt.'

The Spearses lived in Chestnut Ridge at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested.

Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog.

Many of the postings will be used in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama. 

Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death.

Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions.
