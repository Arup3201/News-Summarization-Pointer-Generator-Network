Louis van Gaal made James Wilson change his shirt number because the Manchester United manager believes a striker should have a nine on his back.

Wilson sported the No 49 shirt when he came on as a second-half substitute for Juan Mata during United's 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday.

The 18-year-old wore No 47 during his Premier League debut last year against Hull City, and the youngster explains that Van Gaal intervened to make the change.

‘As I’m a striker, the gaffer wanted me to have a nine in my number, and 49 was the closest,' he told MUTV.

The idea clearly doesn't extend to Robin van Persie, however, who wears No 20. No 19 is free. 

Wilson rose through the ranks at United and Sunday was the teenager's third appearance in the Premier League, having scored twice against Hull last season.

In October against Everton, Wilson became the 30th player used by Van Gaal this season - more than any other team as the Dutchman feels his way around his new squad.

The No 47 slot remains vacant at Old Trafford. Previous owners of the No 49 shirt are Ravel Morrison and Frederic Veseli, but neither played in the Premier League for the Red Devils.
