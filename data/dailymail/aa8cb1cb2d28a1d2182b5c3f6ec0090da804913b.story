Georgia Marshall, 13, was electrocuted at home in Barry, south Wales, as she helped her father get Christmas decorations down from the attic

Like many children excited at the thought of Christmas, Georgia  Marshall couldn’t wait to help her parents deck out the house.

With the decorations stored in the attic, the 13-year-old  followed her father upstairs and offered to hold on to a step ladder while he rummaged around for the tinsel and lights.

But all the joy of the run up to Christmas was about to turn to tragedy.

In a freak accident, Georgia – one of seven siblings – was electrocuted when the ladder she was gripping is thought to have touched a live wire on an extension cable.

Her older sister Amy, 29, said the family had been devastated by Georgia’s death.

She added: ‘My mum can barely speak. My dad is blaming himself, my two youngest siblings don’t want Christmas.’

Georgia’s mother Glenda, 49, said on Facebook: ‘My beautiful light became a shining star today. Love you forever and will miss you till the day I die. My amazing Georgia. Words cannot say how I feel.

‘This is so hard for us. I won’t ever get over this, all your thoughts and help are much appreciated by all of us.’

Georgia, a keen rider and dog lover, was helping her father Richard, 54, as he looked for their box of Christmas decorations in the attic on Saturday when the accident happened.

The Marshalls, from Barry in South 
Wales, are known for having big family Christmases and the tree in their
 lounge last year was festooned with tinsel and baubles.

A
 South Wales Police spokesman said: ‘Shortly after 11am on Saturday 
police officers were called to an address in Barry following reports of 
the death of a 13-year-old girl.

‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this tragic time.’

Neighbour Jean Mayor described Georgia as a ‘bubbly and cheerful’ teenager and her family as ‘incredibly close’.

Georgia was a pupil at all-girls school Bryn Hafren Comprehensive in Barry.

Headmaster
 Phil Whitcombe said: ‘Georgia was one of our more gifted pupils and 
always hard working and polite. She was a lovely girl.

‘We will miss her very much and all our thoughts and prayers are with her family.’

An inquest will be opened and adjourned later this week.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
