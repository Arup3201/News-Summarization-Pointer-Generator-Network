Hope is fading in the desperate search for two young boys who were torn from their mother’s arms as she tried to walk to safety during the height of Superstorm Sandy on Monday night.

Connor and Brandon Moore, aged two and four, were swept away in the rushing storm surge after their mother, Glenda Moore, pulled them out of her SUV and tried to wade through the flood water in Staten Island, New York.

Dozens of police divers and firefighters called off their search as darkness fell last night – 48 hours after the brothers disappeared into the storm.

Police are searching for two young boys on Staten Island who were reported missing in the aftermath of Sandy, which hit the outer borough particularly hard with flooding

About 20 police officers from the NYPD Scuba Unit have fanned out across a Staten Island marsh on Father Capodanno Boulevard in search of the boys

The Staten Island Advance reports that the NYPD vowed to begin the hunt again at first light on Thursday.

Ms
Moore told police her car stalled and she became stranded in the marsh 
when the left her home in search of higher ground as the storm worsened.

She got out of the car clutching Connor and Brandon by the hand.

As the surge came through, she lost her grip on her sons and they were swept away by the water.

She was nearly swept away herself, but clung to a tree until she was able to swim to safety.

Ms Moore found neighbors and begged them for help, but they refused due to the conditions.

She said she waited outside, in the elements, until 8am, when she found a police officer.

Officers
have been using canoes and police dogs, and scuba divers have been 
enlisted to search the area but as yet they have been unable to locate 
the brothers.

The mother told police that as the water started to rise, her car stalled and she got out of the car clutching the two-year-old son in her arms and her four-year-old son by the hand before they were washed away

After they drained the marsh today, 
police pulled out a silver minivan and the mother's blue SUV, according 
to NBC, but still no trace of the boys.

'Cops were in there hip deep trying to get them,' a witness said.

Island, including a 13-year-old girl found in Tottenville, a father and 
son in South Beach, and a 28-year-old off-duty police officer.
