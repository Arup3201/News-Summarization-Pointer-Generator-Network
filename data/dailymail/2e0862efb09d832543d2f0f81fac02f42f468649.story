Manny Pacquiao took time out of his negotiations with Floyd Mayweather Jnr over a possible $300m mega-fight to sing Disney's Let It Go.

The 35-year-old welterweight boxer showed his softer side by belting out the Disney song which features in 2013 feature film Frozen.

Pacquiao has revealed in the past that he enjoys singing when he is away from the boxing ring.

The Filipino, who is scheduled to fight Chris Algieri in November, appeared on Fox Sports to sing a NFL tribute song earlier this week.

Pacquiao has released two music albums during his career behind the mic and featured on a collaboration track in 2013. 

The southpaw fighter is confident of finally landing a fight with Mayweather after years of discussions between the two camps.

Pacquiao said on the possibility of fighting the unbeaten American: 'There are serious negotiations with the Mayweather camp and my promoter.'

When asked if the fight would take place in May, he added: 'Probably for next year.'
