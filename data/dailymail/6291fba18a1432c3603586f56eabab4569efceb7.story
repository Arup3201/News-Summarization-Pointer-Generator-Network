Paula Wilson, who has been jailed for 32 months, after she filmed an unconscious woman having her head shaved at a flat in Ballymena 

A scalping gang has been jailed after they shaved an unconscious victim's head and filmed it on a mobile phone in what has been described as an 'appalling act of degradation'.

The female victim had her head dry-shaved by three men, who then tried to burn the remainder of her hair at a flat in Ballymena, County Antrim, in May 2013.

The trio - Paul Joshua Balmer, William Hamilton and Nathan Telford - then slapped the woman, who has not been named, while the entire attack was filmed on a mobile phone by Paula Wilson. 

The video, which lasts around ten minutes, shows the victim having her eyebrows shaved before her hair is then dry-shaved by the three men.

Using disposable razors, at one stage the footage shows three pairs of hands shaving her head at the same time.

In the footage, one of the men can be heard joking: 'No point on going easy on her, we can't send her away with a poor haircut,' and then asked other, 'Will we just shave the whole head... I am a democratic sort of person, if you want to baldy her, baldy her.'

An attempt is then made to set part of the woman's hair on fire, with jokes being made by her attackers about setting off the fire alarm. 

The footage only came to police attention when Wilson, 22, was arrested for a separate offence by police investigating an attack on 'body-in-the-bin' victim Adam Robinson, who was found naked and bound inside a taped-up wheelie bin.

She will be sentenced later in the year for her part in that attack.

The bin had been hidden in dense undergrowth in the Sentry Hill area of Ballymena and the discovery was made by someone out walking their dog in September 2013.

When Wilson was arrested for the attack on Mr Robinson, detectives seized her mobile phone, and on examination uncovered the shocking head-shaving footage.

As well as the film, there were also multiple images of the injured party and the four defendants on Wilson's phone.

The attack had gone unreported because the vulnerable victim - who had no recollection whatsoever about the incident - was left traumatised and had fled Ballymena.

Wilson, arriving at Antrim Crown Court sitting in Belfast today with her mother. The court heard how she gave conflicting accounts of the head-shaving incidents to two different doctors 

Wilson - who the court heard was expelled from school and who was also sacked from two jobs - gave varying accounts of the head-shaving incident.

While she told one doctor she was so drunk she couldn't remember the event, she told another that she had a clear memory as she hadn't drunk that much alcohol. 

Nathan Telford, who was handed a 40-month sentence for his part in shaving the unconscious victim's head 

At Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast today, she was handed a 32-month sentence, half of which will be spent in custody with the remaining 16 months spent on supervised licence.

It comes after she admitted two counts of aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting common assault.

Three of her co-accused were also jailed for their involvement in the incident on the victim, who Judge Donna McColgan described as 'comatose' and 'extremely vulnerable.'

Hamilton, 23 and Telford, also 23, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault.

Telford was handed a 40 month sentence, half of which will be served in custody with the remaining 20 months on licence and Hamilton was sentenced to 36 months.

Balmer, 42, had denied involvement and contested the matter but was found unanimously guilty by a jury at Antrim Crown Court on three charges last September.

Balmer - who committed the offences two days after he was released from HMP Magilligan - was found guilty of two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault.

The heroin addict, who has 261 previous convictions, was handed a five year sentence - half of which will be spent in prison with the remaining half of the sentence served on licence when he is released from custody.

After passing sentence, Judge McColgan said: 'Should this case come before the Court of Appeal, then that court should be shown the recorded footage of the entire episode.'
