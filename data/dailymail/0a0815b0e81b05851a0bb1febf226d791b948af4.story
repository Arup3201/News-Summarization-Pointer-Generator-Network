Never taking the people you love for granted could be the key to a happy life according to pensioners wishing to dispense their wisdom to their grandchildren.

Three sets of pensioners, including centenarians Maurice and Helen Kaye, have recording a video featuring their advice  for future generations.

And the key to being happy it appears is worrying less, following your dreams, not worrying about the future and being thankful for what you have.

The video asked the pensioners about their happiest moments and what advice they would give to their grandchildren to safeguard their future well-being. 

As well as not taking people for granted, Betty, 95, and Doug, 100, Hale, of Winchester, along with William, 84, Maureen, 80, Norman, of Wellingborough also advised people not to hold grudges and to live in the moment rather than worry.

The couples listed meeting each other, getting married and having their own children as among their most treasured memories.  

1. Never take the people you love for granted

2. Believe in yourself

3. Remember what is important to you

4. Nothing worth having comes easy

5. Put your heart and soul into everything you do

6. Don't hold grudges

7. Don't be jealous of success

8. Stop worrying and live in the moment

9. Spend more time with your family

10. Choose your friends wisely

Mrs Kaye, 101, of Bournemouth, said her happiest moment was when her husband of 80 years walked into her parents' shop for the first time to pick up an order and didn't leave for three hours.

She said: 'I think my best memory was when he walked into my mother's shop to get an order and after three hours my mother said who is going to throw him out, you or me, because no customers can get in.' 

Mr Kaye, 102, said that while that day was not his favourite, as he was chucked out, he was able to arrange a date with his future wife a few weeks later.

As couples who lived through the Second World War, the pensioners said that appreciating each other has been central to their happiness.

Mrs Hale said: 'One of my happiest memories is when I went up to Manchester to see Doug when he was brought back from the second front in France wounded. 

'I walked into the hospital and there he was in hospital blues and he looked at me and there was a great big smile on his face.' 

Mr and Mrs Kaye are pictured on their wedding day 80 years ago and said they fondly remembered the day 

Maureen and William Norman said they were happier now as they appreciated the things they have

The video was directed by BAFTA-award winning director Gary Tarn for insurance company Beagle Street. 

A survey by the company found 1,000 over-70s claimed they were at their most happy around the age of 40.

Getting married, having children and grandchildren featured on the top lists of happiest moments. 

1. Birth of a first child

2. Wedding day

3. Birth of grandchildren

4. Birth of another child

5. Day of retirement

6. Moving into a new home

7. Seeing your child's first steps

8. Hearing your child's first words

9. Meeting the man or woman of your dreams

10. First kiss with them. 

And the biggest regrets....  

1. Choosing the wrong career 

2. Not furthering education

3. Not travelling enough

4. Getting divorced

5. Getting married too soon 

Mrs Norman said while having her children was one of her happiest memories, she feels most content now. 

She said: 'I'm more happy now than I've ever been. Our generation have been through World War Two when things were rationed and food was rationed. 

'It makes us appreciate the things we have now. I could kiss my automatic washing machine.'  

The research also revealed that men are happiest at 40, while women hit their positive peak at 38 - citing being fit and healthy, having a great group of friends and feeling confident in their appearance as the main reasons.

The findings show loving relationships outweigh money and material gains with life's top ten happiest moments dominated by friends and family.

The most common cause for regret was choosing the wrong career and not pursuing lifelong dreams. 

One in ten of those with regrets wished they had worked harder in school with seven per cent regretting that they had not travelled the world.

Matthew Gledhill, managing director of Beagle Street, said: 'The overwhelming message from those with the most life experience is that the key to happiness is to worry less and live in the moment with the people you care about most.
