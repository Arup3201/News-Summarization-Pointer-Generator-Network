Ian Poulter became the latest brave (or mad) star to take up the craze sweeping - and freezing - professional golf right now: the Ice Bucket Challenge.

The flaymboyant Englishman shared a video of himself pouring a huge bin full of ice and water over his own head in his garden in England on Tuesday, mimicking many of the game's biggest names who have already taken up the gauntlet.

After doing so, Poulter immediately challenged his friend and Ryder Cup team-mate Justin Rose to follow suit, as well as US Open champion Martin Kaymer and one more player who might prove a little harder to convince... Tiger Woods.

Woods is known for his often cold demeanor, so whether he needs any further cooling down is a matter for debate.

But if Woods does not accept the dare within 24 hours, in the spirit of the competition he will have to donate $100 to a charity of Poulter's choosing.

Are you up to it, Tiger? Poulter nominated 14-time major winner Woods to repeat the challenge

Nuts: American rising star Rickie Fowler (left) and Swedish star Suzann Pettersson have done their dares 

Rose, meanwhile, claimed he would be doing his bit very soon.

'Got a little work to do today then I guess it's #IceBucketChallenge time this afternoon! Thanks for that @IanJamesPoulter', the former US Open champion said on Twitter.

The craze has become a social media phenomenon in the world of golf over the last few days, with many of the game's biggest names enjoying a bit of masochistic fun.

Women's US Open champion Michelle Wie shared a video of herself taking on the ice bucket, as did Lydia Ko, Lexi Thompson and Suzann Petterssen, her fellow stars in the women's game. Rising American star Rickie Fowler is among the high profile male players to take part so far.

But the world will be on tenterhooks for the next 24 hours waiting to see if Woods rises to the challenge.
