A thug who battered his girlfriend so badly she needed hypnosis to help bring him to justice was today jailed for ten years.

Mum-of-two Zoe Dronfield, 38, suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack.

When she regained consciousness, she found Smith slashing his wrists in a suicide bid but she had no memory of the assault.

She feared he would escape justice until she hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the attack.

Recovery: Zoe Dronfield hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the horrific attach

Injuries: Ms Dronfield suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack

Police then used her evidence in court to convince a jury to convict him of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent and criminal damage.

Today, Ms Dronfield, from from Coventry, West Midlands watched Smith jailed for ten years at Warwick Crown Court in Leamington Spa.

Recorder Richard Atkins QC told him: 'Having beaten her and knocked her senseless you then took a knife to her face.

'The photographs of the victim's injuries are deeply unpleasant. She was quite viciously assaulted and savagely cut.

'This was a sustained attack. There were numerous blows to the victim's head and body with feet and a sharp object.

'I've no doubt you've been a good father to your seven-year-old daughter and it saddens me she won't see you as a free man for some time

'But there's a violent bully in you that won't take no for an answer. I therefore feel ten years in prison plus four on licence is an appropriate sentence.'

Lee Egan, defending, said: 'My client doesn't accept guilt.

'His overriding concern at the police interview immediately after the incident was for Ms Dronfield's welfare. It was an isolated incident and it was not premeditated.

'But she did suffer life changing injuries. He does feel remorse for causing them, although he doesn't remember doing it.' 

Ms Dronfield, from Coventry, was stabbed in the neck by Smith on February 2 last year. He then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries.

She suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain and the stab wound was just 1cm from her jugular vein.

The savage assault also left her with short term memory loss which meant she was unable to recall the hours before the attack.

Speaking after the case, she said: 'I think it was a fair outcome and justice has been done.

'It's about time courts started taking domestic violence seriously. Jason is a controlling bully and I think he has a personality disorder.

'I feel lucky to be alive and I'm glad he's been put away where he can't hurt any other women.

'After the attack I was a shell of my former self and I've never been so low in my life.

'Many women take their own lives after such events but I had to find a way to fight through it and that's why I wanted to get hypnotherapy - to build me back up mentally and fill in the blanks.'

'I want to show other women they can do the same, we do not have to let abusers win,' she added. 

Zoe met Smith on Facebook and they were in a relationship for a year before he attacked her.

They had mutual friends on the social media site and they began chatting, before he soon began showering her with compliments and offering to take her out.

Mr Kilmurry said: 'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma'

Smith acted like a true gentleman, taking to her expensive restaurants and hotels, and treating her like a princess.

They had spent the night of the attack talking before Smith fell asleep and Ms Dronfield went to bed.

She said: 'The next thing I knew, I woke up covered in blood and had no idea what was happening.

'My first thought was I wasn't going to die because I needed to be there for my children. I grew up without a mother and I didn't want that for my children.

'The whole house was covered in blood. The bedroom was red and the bed was sodden. It was like a scene from a horror film.

'The bath was filled with water and he was cleaning knives in the bath. There was an eight-inch knife and a meat cleaver.'

Just a week before the attack, Ms Dronfield was forced to hide in her wardrobe when Smith stormed into her home after she tried to end their relationship.

Prosecutor Raj Punia said: 'A week previously he had come into her home unannounced while she was alone with her four-year-old daughter.

'He damaged a door and ran upstairs where the victim was hiding in a wardrobe in her bedroom. He demanded to know why she wouldn't speak to him anymore.' 

Ms Donfield has found herself a better job and has set up a charity. Of people with her type of head injury, 75 per cent don't return to work

It was only after Zoe visited David Kilmurry, a cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist, that she was able to remember the attack that changed her life.

He said: 'Zoe has made a truly amazing recovery from devastating physical and psychological injuries, to go to court and give evidence.

'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma.

'I feel that her development has been quite amazing. 

'Her head injury was described as moderate to severe closed head. Of the people that survive this type of injury 75 per cent never return to work. 

'Zoe has not only returned to work but has gone and got a better job and set up a charity and has been helping others less fortunate as herself. 

'It wasn't until later on down the hypnotherapy line that the trust built up and she was confident enough to go to 'parts unknown' we embarked on some regression to the event and the detail she remembered was quite amazing even in and out of unconsciousness.'
