Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers insists he will not entertain the thought of off-loading controversial forward Mario Balotelli in the January transfer window.

Reports from Italy have linked Balotelli with Inter Milan and his former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini.

They have coincided with Rodgers admitting that Balotelli, who has started just eight league games since his £16 million summer signing, is struggling to come to terms with Liverpool's style of play.

But with Liverpool still fighting on three cup fronts - the Europa League, League and FA Cups - Rodgers insists nobody will leave when the transfer window opens next week.

Rodgers said: 'It is not something I have even thought about. We have had a lot of games this season in a lot of competitions.

'At this moment in time, it is key for me to keep the squad together.'

The large number of fixtures looming in the new year - plus the on-going injury problems endured by Daniel Sturridge - appear certain to gift Balotelli a January reprieve at Anfield despite his much-publicised problems.

On the morning of Rodgers' claims, Italian newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport claimed Balotelli has 'tested the waters' over a potential move to Inter Milan, where he would reunite with his former manager Roberto Mancini.

Mancini has also not ruled out the switch, with the Italian paper quoting the Inter manager as saying, 'It all depends on him (Balotelli).'

Rodgers has also challenged goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to make the first-team place his own again - after injury to Brad Jones forced him into substitute action in the Boxing Day win at Burnley.

Mignolet was axed after some shaky performances but is now likely to regain his number one position for Monday's visit of Swansea to Anfield.

He said: 'Brad has come into the team and worked very hard but now he's injured and he'll have a scan on his thigh to see the duration of that.

'It's an opportunity for Simon to come back in and prove his worth. He is a very good goalkeeper and he will tell you the time out has helped him to reflect a bit. Now he can come in and try and stay in the team.

'It's been a difficult season for the team, not just for Simon. But certainly I've seen the performance level of all the players improve over the last few weeks.

'He's a very resilient character. Like everyone, he has taken a wee bit of flak and stick but to operate at this level you have to deal with that.

'He came in yesterday and had a couple of edgy moments and he will recognise that but he made a couple of punches, had a couple of crosses and ended the game with a clean sheet. That's what you want as a goalkeeper and as a team.'
