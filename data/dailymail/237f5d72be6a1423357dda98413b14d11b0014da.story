Police officers may face compulsory fitness tests and diets to help them get in shape after it emerged that up to one in five is clinically obese.

A major review of policing has called for running tests and assault course-style assessments to ensure officers can carry on chasing criminals.

Anyone who cannot meet minimum fitness standards – including the most senior officers – would face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal.

The review of police pay and 
conditions, which was published yesterday, also recommends that the 
retirement age for new recruits should be raised from 55 to 60.

The review said a survey of one force had found that barely one in four male officers was normal weight.

In
 the Metropolitan Police 52 per cent of male officers and staff were 
overweight, 22 per cent were obese and 1 per cent were morbidly obese.

Blobbies on the beat: Police officers may face annual fitness tests to make sure they stay in shape

One senior officer told the review some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot complete the warm-up exercises’.

The review was carried out by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, who said police employment practices had been largely unchanged for 35 years and could not be left alone because of the budget crisis.

The report recommends major reforms aimed at saving £1.9billion over five years. It also calls for:

Review: Tom Winsor recommended in his report published today that police officers should face annual fitness tests

The starting salary for police constables to be cut from the current £23,500 to £19,000 for someone with no police-related experience.

An end to automatic pay rises for years of service and new performance-related pay scales for in-demand skills and unsocial hours.

Ending the ban on making officers redundant, to allow chief constables to cut jobs when budgets fall.

Direct entry into the police at superintendent rank for outsiders from business, the military and the security service and fast-track schemes for high-flying graduates.

If accepted in full by Home Secretary Theresa May, the changes would mark a major step away from the ‘job for life’ culture.

Currently most police retire at around 50 on a full pension after 30 years’ service. Those who joined in 2006 and after will have to work until 55 and complete 35 years’ service to claim a full pension.

Mr Winsor recommends the retirement age should increase by five years to 60.

Currently the only fitness tests are for those applying to become police officers, or those joining specialist squads such as firearms.

Under the recommendations anyone who repeatedly fails fitness tests should be put on restricted duties, lose nearly £3,000 a year from their pay and ultimately be dismissed.

By September next year officers should be able to complete a series of 15metre shuttle runs, keeping up with an accelerating beep for three and a half minutes, and basic strength tests.

Although new police officers face a fitness exam when they sign up, there is no re-testing.

With such a lax regime, It is little surprise that 52 per cent of policemen in the Metropolitan Police are overweight.

When they are first recruited, would-be officers face a running test and two strength exams.

Officers have to undergo the bleep test - running between two points 20 metres apart. The bleeps get steadily faster throughout the test.

Police recruits have to achieve level 5.4 - which is the equivalent to running at 5.5mph for three minutes 35 seconds.

As the average walking speed is 3mph, participants barely need to break into a run to pass. The test has been described as a 'joke' by serving officers.

Australian Police forces also use a bleep test when testing recruits who have to achieve up to level nine.

From next September, officers could face annual retests.

In the strength test, officers have to push a 34kg weight and pull a 35kg weight.

In addition, they have to have a grip strength of at least 32kg. This is measured on a dynamometer.

By September 2018 all officers should
 pass an assault course-style circuit test including crawling, jumping, 
climbing, running up stairs and dragging a ‘body’ away from danger.

Mr Winsor said fitness equipment 
should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms to help
 them get fit. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses, 
or given health and diet advice.

The report said that having too many 
officers who were unfit could undermine the response to major incidents 
such as last summer’s riots.

Mr Winsor said: 'It is clear that the
 existing pay system is unfair and inefficient. It was designed in 1920 
and has remained largely unchanged since 1978.

But he added: 'Officers who work on 
the front line, exercising their powers as constables in the most 
difficult circumstances, have nothing to fear from this review.'

Mr
 Winsor said: 'I think the public will be surprised that after passing a
 fitness test at the point of entry, except in special units like 
firearms, physical fitness is not tested again in a 30, 35-year career.'

An initial annual test requiring 
officers to reach level 5:4 on the bleep test should be brought in by 
September next year, he said.

This is equivalent to an average speed of 8.8kph (5.5mph) for three minutes 35 seconds, he said.

Former West Midlands chief constable Sir Edward Crew, who worked on the review, added: 'We are not looking for supermen.'

Mr Winsor predicted that many officers
 would welcome the proposals, saying they would see it 'as a necessary 
protection for themselves and the public'.

Mr Winsor also said a 'system of 
compulsory severance for police officers with less than full pensionable
 service, analogous to redundancy, would materially improve the ability 
of chief officers to alter forces’ workforce size, structure and 
composition according to the projected needs of those forces and the 
public they serve'.
