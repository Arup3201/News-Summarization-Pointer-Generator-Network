Gay rights activists are protesting new TLC show 'My Husband's Not Gay', claiming the show's stars are actively trying to advertise a discredited therapy program that claims to turn homosexual men straight. 

The show, which airs tonight, follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men, but are living as heterosexuals in order to follow their Mormon faith, which doesn't recognize gay marriages.

Groups like GLAAD has called the show 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous' for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs.

While TLC has staunchly denied that the show condones these programs, it has now been revealed that at least three of the stars are spokespeople for organizations which practice this discredited method.

Promoters: It has now been revealed that the Dalgrens and co-star Jeff Bennion (pictured) are spokespeople for a group that promotes a therapy program to turn homosexual men straight 

Outrage: As of Sunday, more than 123,000 people had signed an online petition to get the show cancelled. Network TLC has refused to back down, and the show is set to air tonight at 10pm 

His story: Pret Dahlgren was the former chairman of Evergreen International, a Mormon group which promoted a therapy to help homosexual men ignore their urges and live as heterosexuals. Pictured above speaking at a conference on the issue in 2012

GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis recently described what is so dangerous about these therapy programs in a recent interview.

'Basically, gay reparative therapy is the notion that you can take the gay out of somebody, which we know is not true,' Ellis told Entertainment Tonight . 'Medical experts have debunked that for ages now, and also it's illegal in a lot of states.'  

Married couple Preston and Megan Dahlgren have both acted as spokesmen for three such organizations - North Star International, Evergreen International and People Can Change. 

Before it was absorbed into North Star last year, Pret Dahlgren was the chairman of Evergreen International, a LDS organization that promoted 'reparative therapy' for those with 'same-sex attraction'. 

The therapy - pioneered by the group Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity - has not been supported in the psychological community which recognizes homosexuality as a normal human orientation. 

While it was still running, the group advertised therapy that helped people 'diminish...same-gender attractions and overcome homosexual behavior'. 

At a 2012 conference, Dahlgren even gave a speech about his own struggles with 'same-sex attraction' which he said 'are almost invariably rooted in deeper issues'. 

In another video from 2013, Dahlgren again promoted 'ex-gay' therapy, saying that he thinks it's possible to prevent these urges.

When Evergreen shut down in January 2014, it became absorbed into North Star International, where Dahlgren joined the board.  His wife Megan has been actively involved in both North Star, Evergreen and another similar organization - People Can Change.

Meanwhile, co-star Jeff Bennion,  who is also married to a woman, is the co-founder of North Star and has written many essays on the website. He has also defended 'sexual orientation change efforts'.

TLC does not mention the Dalgrens or Bennion's involvement in these organizations in the special, which Salt Lake Tribune TV columnist Scott D Pierce calls a 'clear attempt to deceive the viewers'.

It's also strange that the network doesn't mention North Star, since the group claims that all of the stars on the show are involved in their community in an online post. 

As of Sunday afternoon, more than 123,000 people had signed a petition to have 'My Husband's Not Gay' cancelled.  But TLC has refused to back down and the show is scheduled to air tonight at 10pm ET.
