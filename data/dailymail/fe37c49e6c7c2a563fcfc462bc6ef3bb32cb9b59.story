Steffon Armitage may be poised to make a shock return to English rugby in time to push for World Cup selection, if his French club, Toulon, agree to release him.

The 29-year-old flanker has recently been investigating the possibility of switching Test allegiance to France, as he has been unavailable for England selection while based across the Channel. 

But it is understood that he has had a change of heart and Bath have made urgent enquiries about signing him with immediate effect.

Age: 29

Position: Flanker

Height: 5ft 9in Weight: 16st 3lb

Clubs 

Saracens (2004-06)

London Irish (2006-11)

Toulon (2011-)

England (five caps, 2009-2011)

A loan move is not an option, so any sudden transfer would have to be permanent; a situation complicated by the fact that Armitage is in the first year of a lucrative three-year deal with Toulon, on an annual salary of around £320,000. 

In theory, Bath - who will be without their injured Springbok flanker Francois Louw until December - would need to pay a 'hefty fee' to secure the services of the European Player of the Year.

Sportsmail has been told that there is a 50-50 chance of a move being approved in the next 24 hours, but the final decision rests with Toulon head coach, Bernard Laporte. 

Injuries to two of his other back-rowers, Juan Smith and Mamuka Gorgodze, on Sunday seemingly reduced the likelihood of Armitage being authorised to leave, but there remains a significant chance it could happen.

On Monday night, Laporte told the BBC: ‘The season has begun, we have to move quickly if he wants to change. He has a contract, but if the England coach says if he plays for Bath or Saracens, then he will play in the World Cup, I think he has to play for these clubs.’

However, the mention of Saracens appears to be a red herring. While the north London club were linked to Armitage in initial French reports, Sportsmail has learned that they have 'no interest' in bringing him to Allianz Park. Last year's Aviva Premiership and Heineken Cup finalists already have two high-class opensides in Will Fraser and Jacques Burger.

The first reports in France also suggested that Toulon had been approached by the RFU about the possibility of releasing Armitage from his contract, but union sources have insisted that this is not true.

England's coaches are monitoring the situation and would welcome the prospect of a pedigree breakdown poacher putting added pressure on their established captain and first-choice No 7, Chris Robshaw.

Armitage won five caps for England in 2009 and 2010, but his sensational form amid Toulon’s squad of Galacticos has led to repeated calls for the national coaches to recall him, despite the RFU’s stance against the selection of players based overseas.

In theory, if Bath were to sign Armitage by tomorrow, he could make his debut in their opening match in the new European Champions Cup - at Glasgow on Saturday. His arrival would surely come too late to earn a late call-up to England's squad for the autumn Tests, but strong form in the coming months would force him into contention for the Six Nations early next year.
