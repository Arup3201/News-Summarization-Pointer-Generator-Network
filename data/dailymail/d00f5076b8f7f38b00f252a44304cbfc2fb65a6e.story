Jodie Williams stormed down the home straight to clinch silver in the 200 metres and could win two more medals in the relays. 

The 20-year-old was fourth coming round the bend but charged through the field to clock 22.46 seconds.

It was the second time in two weeks that Williams has set a personal best in a major championships final after she ran 22.50 to win silver at the Commonwealth Games.

Dutch delight: Williams was beaten by Dafne Schippers (centre) who clocked 22.04 seconds

Williams, nicknamed ‘Moneylegs’ after going unbeaten for over five years and 151 races as a junior, has proved she has what it takes on the senior stage. 

Only the stunningly good Dutch Dafne Schippers, was too good for her. Schippers clocked 22.04, the fastest in the world this year, after winning the 100m earlier in the week.

‘I’m so happy,’ said Williams. ‘To come away with two silver medals at senior level, I couldn’t ask for any more.

‘I was trying to chase Dafne down but her time was crazy. I’m so tired after the Commonwealth Games.’

Williams plans to run in the 4 x 100m and possibly the 4 x 400m relay.

‘It would be amazing to get three medals,’ she said. ‘I’m just going to have to see how my legs recover.’

There was heartbreak for 18-year-old Dina Asher-Smith, who fell to her knees after breaking down with an apparent hamstring injury.

Asher-Smith who had ‘the best day of her life’ on Thursday when she set a new British junior 200m record and got the A-levels required to read history at King’s College, was helped off by Williams and team-mate Bianca Williams who came fourth.

‘I have a love-hate relationship with my hamstring,’ she said. ‘This was one of the hate days.’
