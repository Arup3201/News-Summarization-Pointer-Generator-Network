Adidas have stepped up their #therewillbehaters campaign with an advert playing up the reputations of some of world football's biggest names to help launch their new boots.

Diego Costa, Karim Benzema, Arjen Robben and David Alaba star in a short video as a voice-over lists some of the negative things that fans of rival clubs often criticise the players for - showboating, celebrity status and image.   

But, the advert contends, the motivations behind these hateful comments are largely rooted in envy and the critics secretly wish that they were actually wearing 'shiny new boots' themselves.

Real Madrid and France forward Karim Benzema flaunts his expensive sports car to the cameras 

The ad is the second of its kind and a previous clip saw Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Luis Suarez also unite against their 'haters.'

Adidas' controversial campaign has been criticised by some people as narcissistic and self-aggrandising.  

The 'shiny new boots' mentioned in the videos are retailing at £190. 

Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben shrugs his shoulders at accusations that he is a showboater
