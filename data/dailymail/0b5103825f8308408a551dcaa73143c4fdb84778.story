A Pennsylvania woman is outraged after being ordered by a judge to stop breastfeeding her 10-month-old daughter as part of the terms of a custody dispute.

Jessica Moser, from Northampton County, said she was told by a family court judge two weeks ago to nursing her daughter Jasmine so the little girl can spend two days a week with her father.

Moser said she can't pump enough milk for two days and that Jasmine will not take a bottle.

'I'm feeling frustrated ... hurt,' she told WFMZ-TV.

'I'm trying to keep myself from crying, it's very emotional.

'If I do not comply I will have my child taken away.'

This must stop: New mum Jessica Moser has been told by a judge to switch her daughter Jasmine to formula from breastfeeding so that she can spend each weekend with her father. The case has sparked quite a debate

'I'm emotional and hurt': Pennsylvania mom Jessica Moser fights back tears as she explains how her custody battle may force her to stop breastfeeding

Moser has had primary custody of Jasmine since she was born last December.

However now the father has pressed for more time with his daughter.

Moser said she is not trying to keep Jasmine from her father - she just wants to continue breastfeeding.

The World Health Organization recommends that all babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, then start eating solid foods, while continuing to nurse for at least two years.

However Moser said the judge told her to switch to formula.

'He did say something along the lines like, ''well she should be on formula'', or ''why isnâ€™t she on formula?'', ''she should be able to have formula at ten months'',' she said.

The World Health Organization recommends mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years, if possible

However the mom maintains that being able to choose when to stop breastfeed is her right and hers alone.

'I'm very passionate about having the right to breastfeed,' she said.

'The breast is best and that's what I'm trying to do for her.'

An attorney for the father did no return calls for comment.

The story has ignited a debate among mothers and parenting blogs.

Frances Locke from Mommyish wrote an editorial saying the father should 'be ashamed'.

'Custody battles are complicated, personal and often brutal,' she wrote.

Controversy: Breastfeeding in the media usually sparks debate, but TIME magazine created a stir with one of its covers in May 2012, featuring a mother nursing her three-year-old son. It reignited a long-running dialogue over when mothers should stop breastfeeding

'With this situation we don't have all the facts so it's hard to point fingers, but I don't think this has to be an either-or situation.

'This child should be able to see her dad and continue nursing - and the judge should encourage this option, not tell mom to stop nursing and use formula.

'Itâ€™s important for a child to have a bond with both parents and for a baby to be nourished with her motherâ€™s milk.

'Unless there are details that haven't come out yet, I think ... the father should be ashamed.

When Gillette refused the blanket, she was escorted off the plane. The mother-of-four sued the airline for an unspecified amount and settled out of court only last year

In 2006, New Mexico mom Emily Gillette was kicked off a Delta Connections flight for breast-feeding her 22-month-old daughter and refusing to cover up. Gillette filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Burlington, Vermont, in 2009.

She settled with the airline in 2012 for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.Her story, which gained national attention, prompted a protest "nurse-in" in 19 airports in November 2006 by outraged mothers.
