Christina Huffington, the daughter of media mogul Arianna Huffington, has posted pictures of herself happily kissing her new girlfriend.

The 24-year-old writer - who has been open about a battle with cocaine that nearly killed her -  is believed to be seeing film producer Sophie Watts and has put up a series of pictures of the blonde on her Instagram account.

A source told MailOnline: 'Christina and Sophie have been dating for a while, they're very happy.'

Christina beams in the pictures - which include a picture of Sophie and her dog, to which she remarks 'My faves'.

While in another photo, Sophie is seen at breakfast with Christina in Los Angeles, showing off a newspaper advert for Ariana's new book Thrive.

Sophie is thought to be the daughter of Tessa Watts, a renowned English music video producer, who has worked with stars ranging from Michael Jackson to Madonna and Paul McCartney and Beyonce.

Tessa is best known as one of the original members of Virgin Records and has been credited with coming up with the name for the company, founded by Sir Richard Branson, as all the staff were 'virgins' to business. She is divorced from rock journalist Michael Watts.

Sophie attended Cambridge University and is now a film producer in her own right.

Christina's father is former Republican congressman Michael Huffington, who came out as bisexual following his divorce from Arianna Huffington in 1998.

She has been open about her lengthy battle with cocaine addiction that started when she was just 16. She first made the admission in a harrowing essay on her mother's website Huffington Post last April.

She revealed how she had suffered bulimia as a teenager, scarred by her parents divorce, saying things came to a halt in 2012, writing: 'On March 4th, 2012, I was having trouble breathing. 'Am I going to be okay?' I asked the nurse who was monitoring my heart rate. 'I don't know,' she said. 'If you are, I hope you stop destroying your life'.'

She then penned a piece for Glamour magazine and went on the Today show, telling host Savannah Guthrie that despite all appearances, she was snorting lines of cocaine alone 'six or seven times' a day while at Yale University.

She said It was 'absolutely un-glamorous. It was very much me by myself, in my apartment using drugs all day, from morning to night. There was nothing fun about it. I wasn’t at fun parties. I was really depressed, I was scared, I was anxious. I sort of felt isolated and alone and I thought I would never get out of there.'

Christina, who is friends with troubled star Lindsay Lohan, who has also battled with drink and drugs, said she was opening up about her struggle in order to show people that drug addiction can hit anyone regardless of their social and economic background.

'II have been really blessed, and that’s part of the reason I struggled coming forward. What I want to show is that addiction can strike, no matter what. You can come from a loving family. You can have financial resources and you can still feel that pit of loneliness and emptiness and that desire to fill it with substances, so I just wanted to give a different face to the disease.'

At one point, Christina said her mother was so worried she would drive her to the doctor for random drug testing, telling her 'I'm scared of what a good liar you are'.

First trying the drug as a teen at boarding school, Christina told how she and her friends would spend $50 on a gram, meeting the drug dealer at the mall in Los Angeles and then getting their house keepers to pick them up, adding: 'We didn’t even have our licenses, but there we were, doing coke at each other’s houses.'

Arianna said: ''Millions of young people in their teens and 20s struggle with alcohol and drug addiction.

'If Christina’s story can prevent one parent watching now from getting the call that I got, 'Mommy, I can't breathe,' and help one young or young man come out, reach out for help and know you can turn your life around, then it will have been worth it.'

Christina has now been sober since March 4, 
2012, 'a day I’ll never forget. I stayed up all night doing cocaine, 
then smoked pot with a friend.'

She
 then found it hard to breathe and ran barefoot into the streets of New 
Haven, Conn., and ended up in the emergency room. She recalled asking 
the nurse just before she was sedated whether she would be okay.

'I don’t know,' the nurse told her. 'But I hope, if you are, you’ll stop destroying your life.'

Christina, who headed back to Yale to finish her degree, now lives in New York City with her 
mother and her younger sister, Isabella, who told her 'you owe it to us 
to get better' after putting them through so much.

'I
 know there are thousands of those girls out there, feeling like I did: 
alone, isolated, and guilty. I want to tell them that getting through it
 is possible. And once you do get through it, you have a life.' she 
said.

She now works at Huffington Post in the Women's section, adding: 'I get 
to write about a lot of things I care about: body-image issues, mental 
health, and relationship stuff. It’s funny, because I’d always seen 
[Huffington Post] from the outside; I never really knew how it worked. 
But now I see behind-the-scenes, and everyone is very cool.'
