A German woman has died in a skydiving accident in Arizona where parachutists were attempting to set a world record.

The woman, who has not been named, was jumping in Eloy at 7.30am on Thursday when her parachute malfunctioned, Jocelyn Bernatchez, spokeswoman for Skydive Arizona, said.

'The malfunctioning parachute was released too low to allow the reserve parachute to fully open,' she told the Arizona Daily Star.

The skydiver was declared dead at the scene.

'It had nothing to do with the size of the group or the aircraft,' World Team spokeswoman Gulcin Gilbert said. 'It was a malfunction of the parachute.'

The accident occurred on Thursday during an attempt to break a world record for what is called a 'formation jump'.

A group of 220 people from 28 countries free-fall from about 18,000 feet, then come together in a formation before separating and doing another formation before pulling their parachutes.

The skydivers jumped at such a high 
elevation that they needed oxygen masks in the airplane, and they 
hurtled through the air at speeds of more than 100 mph.

The group did not complete the formation and therefore did not set the record on Thursday. World Team organized the event at Skydive Arizona, one of the nation's top skydiving locations.

Skydivers cried and hugged each other and prayed after they learned of the death.

Skydive Arizona in Eloy has been the site of other skydiving deaths in recent months.

Two skydivers - from Germany and the United Kingdom - died in November as their parachutes collapsed and they fell to their deaths during an attempt to set a jump record.

The previous record was carried out in Florida with 110 people in November 2013, according to Skydive Mag.
