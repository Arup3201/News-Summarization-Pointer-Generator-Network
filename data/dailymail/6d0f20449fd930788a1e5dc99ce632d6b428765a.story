It's a dilemma which troubles few 16-year-olds - which classic car shall I go for today? My 1967 Triumph or my 1930 Austin Ulster?

Ollie Forysth is spoiled for choice after he launched two businesses and bought a share in two vintage vehicles - despite being too young to drive.

The teenager from Pury End near Towcester, Northamptonshire, makes £13,000 a year from an internet fashion shop which he opened when he was just 13.

Driven to success: Ambitious entrepreneur Ollie Forsyth makes £13,000 a year in profit from his two online businesses and part-owns a 1930 Austin Ulster (pictured) - despite being too young to be able to drive it

The young entrepreneur opened another retailer last year which has already made £2,000.

Next month his sights will be set on business stardom as he begins a business course backed by Dragon's Den entrepreneur Peter Jones.

Ollie said he was inspired to succeed after being diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four and his idols include the Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson.

Undeterred by struggles with school work, the youngster turned to business aged just six by making family members and friends cups of tea for 20p each - with an extra 20p fee for reheating.

His father Angus, an insurance broker, and mother Melanie, who runs an interior design business, sent him to the specialist Bruern Abbey School for pupils with dyslexia in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

Feeling flush: Ollie's shop has made him thousands of pounds selling belts, cufflinks, wallets and necklaces

The teenager was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four, but he said it helped him. 'I think without being dyslexic, I wouldn’t have started a business,' he said. 'It's a huge driving tool that makes people successful'

From there he went to study at the £31,000-a-year Milton Abbey School in Blandford Forum, Dorset, where he picked up Cs, Ds and Fs at GCSE last week.

But long before his exams he had begun to show flair as a businessman.

The ambitious teenager began selling friendship bracelets to school friends before launching Ollie’s Shop, an online gift shop selling jewellery and accessories, at just 13 years old.

The shop has made him thousands of pounds selling belts, cufflinks, wallets and necklaces aimed at teenagers.

It turned over £5,000 in its first year with a £2,500 profit.

By last year that had risen to a £25,000 turnover and healthy profit of £13,000.

Generous: The teenager said he makes sure to support several charities through his impressive online sales

But Ollie didn't stop there, launching his second enterprise - online fashion retailer www.charmou.com - four months ago. So far it is thought to have made around £2,000.

The teenager supports several charities through his sales, but it is not all work and no play.

In his spare time he restores classic cars, and part-owns two with his father Angus - whose insurance work involves classic cars - and a third investor who is also a family member.

Ollie said: 'If I can become a millionaire in my 20s and a billionaire before I die, I would be a happy chap'

One day he hopes he will be able to drive his 1967 Triumph GT6 Mk1 and his 1930 Austin Ulster.

'I’m not an academic person but my strength lies in being an entrepreneur,' he said.

'I’m glad I started at a young age because my confidence has grown so much and at that age you have nothing to lose, you can just go for it.

'I think without being dyslexic, I wouldn’t have started a business. It’s a huge driving tool that makes people successful.

'I really do like being dyslexic, it makes me so much more driven and I’m determined to succeed in life.'

He added: 'Ollie’s Shop started when I noticed a history teacher of mine at school wearing a friendship bracelet.

'I bought some with my pocket money and sold them for £10 each. Before I knew it I’d made £100. Everything went from there really and I launched Ollie’s Shop just a few months later.'

Next month Ollie will begin studying at a branch of the Peter Jones Enterprise Academy, a network of business colleges supported by the TV entrepreneur.

'In the future I would like to start my own business magazine,' he added. 'I would also like to move to Dubai for a few years and would love to live in New York..

'My ethos is, if I can become a millionaire in my 20s and a billionaire before I die, I would be a very happy chap.

'My GCSE grades shows qualifications aren’t everything at the end of the day. I have two businesses and people really do see potential in me and I’m really grateful for that.'

Ollie’s mother said her son had always been driven from a very young age. She added: 'We’re so proud of him and everything he has achieved.'
