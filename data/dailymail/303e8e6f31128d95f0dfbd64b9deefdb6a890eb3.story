Apart from golf, perhaps the only other thing all 12 European players plus their captain Paul McGinley have in common is a love of football. 

So you can imagine the reaction when Sir Alex Ferguson walked into the team room at Gleneagles last evening.

It didn’t matter, of course, that only two of them supported Manchester United; that rival clubs including Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich all had their supporters.

How could it not help to swap stories, enjoy a little banter and hear some inspirational words from arguably the greatest British manager of all time?

‘I met him first at the JP McManus Invitational in Ireland 15 years ago and when I became captain, for a number of reasons, I asked him,’ said McGinley, before they all gathered. 

He loves his golf and there were a number of things that he was particularly good at as a manager where I thought he would be a natural fit. 

'But this is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. This is about fun.’ 

McGinley said the conversation with Ferguson would be about having fun, not a headmaster's preaching

Europe are looking for their third straight success over USA, having won in 2012 and at Celtic Manor in 2010

It continues a recent tradition that saw rugby legend Gareth Edwards speak at Celtic Manor four years ago and Bayern manager Pep Guardiola say a few words at Medinah.

‘There’s a lot to be gained from hearing different voices from different sports,’ said McGinley. ‘It’s relaxed and it is a conversation. I thought Gareth was brilliant and I know Sir Alex will be fantastic with the players.’

Day two of Ryder Cup week and big crowds turned up to watch the first official day of practice. Many of the players got their first look at the fabulous grandstand around the first hole that will be such a feature of the three days of competition.

McGinley sent his players out in threes, which might seem a strange way to prepare for fourballs and foursomes but, as ever with this deep thinker, carried logic.

‘It was so they could play quicker, because I didn’t want them on the course for six-and-a-half hours, as they were at Medinah,’ he argued.

Both captains are acutely aware that a lot of players are coming into this contest on the back of a heavy workload of eight tournaments in 10 weeks.

Indeed, American captain Tom Watson said he was concerned that a lot of his players are tired, which seemed a bizarre thing to flag up before the Ryder Cup had even started.

‘They’ve played too much golf and it is definitely something that should be looked at and addressed in the future,’ he said. ‘They are tired, but you have to deal with it.’

McGinley poked gentle fun at Watson and his talk of targeting Ian Poulter. ‘I don’t know how you target someone in golf, you’d have to ask Tom, but I do know Poults loves all that sort of talk,’ he said. 

‘He loves playing the villain. He was the villain for America at Medinah and he’s relishing the chance to play the role again.’
