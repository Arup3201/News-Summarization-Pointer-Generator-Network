British universities killed a staggering 1.3million animals last year in the name of research, it has emerged.

Among the slaughtered animals were almost a million mice, 124 monkeys, 10 dogs and six emus that were all killed for medical and veterinary research throughout British universities and research institutes.

Edinburgh University had the highest death rate, with 226,341 animals being killed, followed by Oxford and Cambridge.

Almost 75 per cent of the animals killed by universities and research institutions in the last year were mice

Some 226,000 fish, 50,000 frogs and 4,250 birds were put to death for vivisection - compared to just 40,248 animals that are killed for research by the Institute for Cancer Research annually.

The figures were obtained in Freedom of Information Act requests by The Tab series of student newspapers to every university in Britain.

Yesterday, animal welfare groups expressed their 'disgust' at the findings and claimed much of the research is funded by High Street charities.

Michelle Thew, CEO of The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV),said: 'The details of some (university) research will not only surprise but disgust.

MICE: 978,259

FISH: 278,586

RATS: 51,218 

FROGS: 5,552 

BIRDS: 4,246

CHICKENS: 2,953

REPTILES: 2,040 

MONKEYS: 124

DOGS: 10

CATS: 2

EMUS: 6

'Tests have involved forcing rodents to inhale diesel fumes to investigate their harmful effects and deliberately inflicting high levels of stress on baby animals to see if having a stressful childhood causes mental health issues in adulthood.

'Many members of the public are under the illusion that all animal experimentation is vital for human health benefits, whereas this couldn’t be further from the truth.'

The FoI request was submitted to a total of 132 universities and research institutes. 

Among the 44 universities who replied, a total of 1,329,013 animals were killed between July 2012 and July 2013, with mice accounting for 73 per cent of the dead.

The University of Edinburgh has the highest death toll due to its College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, which is one of the oldest units of its kind in the UK.

The college euthanised 165,050 mice, 51,368 fish, 7,260 rats and 1,824 birds, while Oxford University's casualties included 29 monkeys, 18 pigs and 43 badgers.

Cambridge University’s deaths included 186 guinea pigs and 36 primates, while six emus were killed at the Royal Veterinary College in London.

Kings College London, Imperial College London and Stirling University in Scotland were the only other three institutions which killed more than 100,000 animals.

Andrew Tyler, the director of Animal Aid, said the experiments carried out on animals are unreliable for human medicines.

'Apart from causing a great deal of suffering to these animals the experiments of this type do not deliver the data that is reliable and productive for human medicine.

'It should not happen, especially not at universities.

'Much of the research of this sort in universities is funded by medical research charities, high street charities, such as the British Heart Foundation or Cancer Research.

'When we polled people a huge 80 per cent said they didn’t want their money going into this type of research, so the British public is not happy with this either.'

'I don’t think they know this happens at universities.'

Mr Tyler's sentiments were echoed by animal rights group PETA, who told Mail Online: 'The development of cutting-edge non-animal methodologies that can accurately predict what happens in human beings is exciting and also progressive science that works.

'Unless they wish to be at the bottom of the science pile, these universities need to embrace today's technological breakthroughs.'

But the Association of Medical Research Charities refuted claims the research being carried out was unnecessary.

Chief Executive, Sharmila Nebhrajani, said: 'Charities fund projects using animals only when they are satisfied that there is no possible alternative.

'That the scientific benefit that will come from the project will outweigh the impact of the experiment on animals and that all animals in the lab are treated as respectfully and humanely as possible.'

Newcastle University used 14 macaques, while Kings College London euthanised 39 marmosets, the Freedom of Information request revealed.

The University of Leicester, which euthanised 18,204 animals, declined to comment to The Tab and directed reporters to a statement on animal testing on the website of its Central Research Facility.

The statement reads: 'Animals are only used in research programmes where there are no alternatives.

'The minimum number of animals consistent with the objectives of the research is used and the animals are housed in optimal conditions.

'The University’s use of animals is scrutinised by an ethical review process which includes lay representation (including members external to the University).'
