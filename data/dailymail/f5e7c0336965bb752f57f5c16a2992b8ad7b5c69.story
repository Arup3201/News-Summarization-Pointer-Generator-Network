The father of California teenager Connor Ekchadrt posted online a heartbreaking video recorded at his son’s graveside warning other parents and children about the dangers of synthetic drugs that claimed his son’s life this summer.

Eckhardt, 19, was declared brain-dead in July after taking one hit of synthetic marijuana commonly known as ‘Spice’ and falling into a coma.

Since Connor’s passing, his parents, Devin and Veronica Eckhardt, have been raising awareness of the dangers of synthetic drugs, which are readily available for purchase in bodegas and smoke shops.

Father's grief: Devin Eckhardt is seen here in July embracing his brain-dead son, 19-year-old Connor, after he fell into a coma as a result of smoking synthetic marijuana

On Monday, Devin Eckhardt uploaded a video on his late son’s Facebook page showing him at his son’s graveside to send a strong message to other parents and children about Spice and similar narcotics.

‘I'm standing here at your graveside, Connor, and I can't believe this is true,’ Mr Eckhardt says, addressing his deceased child.

‘I look at this stone and I see you name on it, and I just think, ‘This can't be where things are, this can't be my life… and at any minute you're gonna call, or you're gonna come bounding up on you skateboard with that chuckle in your laugh and that this nightmare will end.

‘And I know you’re not here, I know you’re with Jesus, and I think that's the only reason we can go on and yet... I got a massive hole in my heart ‘cause I miss you so much.’

According to the grieving father, Connor was under ‘tremendous’ peer pressure the night of July 12 when he made the fateful decision to smoke synthetic marijuana.

‘But one hit of Spice and it changed everything, not just for you but for us, for you mom and your sisters. It's the worst nightmare ever.

Crusader: Mr Eckhardt stressed that drugs like Spice are very dangerous and said that families need to take a stand against them  

The family have been raising awareness of the risks of synthetic drugs over the past three months 

I don't have my son to surf with, or ride motocross, or to do all the fun things we loved doing,’ Eckhardt says in the heart-rending video looking at a stone slab engraved with his son’s name. ‘Sometimes I'm not sure how we're supposed to go on, or what I'm supposed to do.’

The father concludes his homemade PSA, which as of Monday night has been shared nearly 290 times, by expressing hope that parents familiar with their story will take it to heart and ‘do things differently.’

‘If you think Spice and synthetics are some ‘OK’ kind of drug, somehow this won't happen to you… don't fool yourself.

‘We have to take a stand, we gotta change things. This shouldn't be,’ he says. ‘Our lives are forever changed. Don't let what happened to us happen to you.’ 

The Eckhardts have launched a worldwide campaign against synthetic drugs through Connor's Facebook page and through a site called Do It 4 Connor, raising awareness that substances like Spice and K2 can not only kill, but can also cause heart attacks and brain damage. 

'We thought we were in touch,' Devin and Veronica Eckhardt told Fox11. 'We thought we were the cool parents. We knew what was going on.'

'He gave into (peer pressure) — thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe — and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Mr Eckhardt told KTLA in August.

Also known as K2, spice is a mixture of herbs that's sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana.

The herbs and chemicals in spice vary, making it impossible for users to know what they're smoking and in what concentrations.

'These substances are not benign,' Dr Andrew Monte, the lead author of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, told the station.

'People may not realize how dangerous these drugs can be – up to 1,000 times stronger binding to cannabis receptors when compared to traditional marijuana.'

Incredibly, it's readily available in shops and online, even though the sale of it is illegal in California.

Precious moments: The Eckhardts spent four days with their son before he was taken in to surgery to remove his organs for donation

Synthetic marijuana has been labeled incense, potpourri and herbal smoking blend — and it's been sold using names such as K2 and Spice.

Connor Eckhardt fell asleep after taking a single hit of spice. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma.

Doctors were unable to detect Spice in Connor's system because there's no way to trace its ever-changing components, but the package of the drug was still in his pocket, and no other drugs were found in his system. 

Sabrina Eckhardt is just a year and a half younger than her brother and she, like the other two Eckhardt children, was adopted.

Meaning from loss: The family is determined that Connor's death will not be in vain and are spreading his story to warn others

She and Connor were extremely close and she has struggled to come to terms with her brother's loss.

The Eckhardts used their last precious minutes with Connor, a California boy whose bronzed skin was a testament to his love of surfing and skateboarding, to do something incredibly brave.

They filmed a short video by Connor's bedside in July about the dangers of synthetic marijuana.

'This is our son, Connor Reid Eckhardt,' Veronica said, her voice raw with emotion.

'He made the deadly choice to use a product called K2, or spice, and Connor is completely brain-dead... This is not a game, it is totally real, please help us fight his fight.'
