Family and friends say slain American journalist James Foley was a compassionate and capable journalist who tried to see the good in others.

Foley, 40, was abducted in Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012 and hadn’t been heard from since until a video showing his killing at the hands of Islamic State extremists was posted on the Internet in August.

On Saturday, hundreds of family, friends and supporters filed into Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Church in Foley’s hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire, for a memorial Mass on what would have been his 41st birthday.

Final farewell: Hundreds of loved ones filed into Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Church in Foley’s hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire, for a memorial Mass on what would have been James Foley's 41st birthday

A mighty heart: A friend said there were two absolutes in Foley’s life: his faith and his family

Kind words: James' brother, Mike Foley (left), delivered an emotional eulogy during the Mass, and Rev Marc Montiny (right), who personally knew the journalist, also spoke at the memorial 

Afterward, loved ones paid tribute to Foley in a poignant ceremony.

One friend, Jeremy Osgood, said there were two absolutes in Foley’s life: His faith and his family. Osgood said those gave him a 'wealth of strength and courage.' 

James' brother, Mike Foley, delivered an emotional eulogy paying tribute to the journalist's legacy.

'I'll never make complete sense of why Jim died but I don't think it's for me to understand, but he did not die in vain,' a somber Mr Foley told the congregation, choking back tears.

'He reminded us simply that good does triumph over evil. Anyone who had forgotten this need only follow his story.

'It has been said the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. Jim was a man of action, as his legacy shows.'

Rev Marc Montminy, who personally knew James Foley, lauded him for the great and important work he had been doing covering war zones.

'What Jim did is he gave voice to people in places where there is no free speech or free press,' said Montminy. 'He gave his life because of it.'

Since his death, his family has created the James W. Foley Legacy Fund to support reporters in conflict zones and the families of American hostages as well as promote a global conversation about how governments can handle hostage crises.
