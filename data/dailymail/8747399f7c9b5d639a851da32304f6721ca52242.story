A large sinkhole opened up in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania today following significant sewer work in the area

The sinkhole was at least 30 feet wide by 12 feet deep, and caused significant damage to houses in the neighborhood, authorities said.

News of the phenomenon comes only two weeks ago when a Florida man was swallowed up in a sinkhole that opened under his house.

The Morning Call newspaper of Lehigh Valley reports that while no injuries were reported, there was significant structural damage to buildings within a half a block radius of the giant hole.

It formed under the home of resident Doris Jenkins, who said that there were a few indicators that a sinkhole could be forming.

She said that while she was taking her three dogs for a walk around 4am Sunday morning, she saw an unbelievable site: ‘A big hole opening up at the end of the driveway.’

Officials evacuated Ms Jenkins and her daughter, Ingeborg and deemed their home uninhabitable. 

Township manager Howard Kutzler told the Express Times that it is unclear what caused the sinkhole, though construction work on a sewer line could be a culprit.

The woman's house experienced structural damage, including cracks in her foundation and walls, but no one was hurt

‘We have aging infrastructure and we’re looking to fix it,’ he said, adding that much of the township’s pluming dates back to the 1970s.

As the paper notes, sinkholes are not uncommon in that region of eastern Pennsylvania, as the limestone bedrock is relatively weak.

Sinkholes are caused by the sudden dissolution of soluble materials and can cause significant damage. 

Jeff Bush, 37, was swallowed into a 50-foot-deep hole at his family’s house in Brandon, near Tampa, Florida, two weeks ago.

Though emergency crews tried to rescue him, they eventually called off the search and razed the home to the ground. 

Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities.

When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion.

Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. 

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes.

While they often occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by human activity.

Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed.Source: USGS
