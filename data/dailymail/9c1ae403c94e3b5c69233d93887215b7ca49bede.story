Early morning sunlight streams through the trees and caresses the ivy-clad cottage they surround.

This sight is a timely reassurance that, while the days may be getting colder,  autumn’s spectacular show of colour can enchant our senses and warm our hearts.

Cloaked in shades of red, gold and green, the Tu Hwnt i’r Bont tearooms in Conwy, North Wales, this weekend seemed to become part of its surrounding countryside, the structure only given away by the white of its windows.

The 15th century cottage is transformed at this time of year by its coat, a massive Virginia creeper, changing from deep green to copper red.

Formerly a courthouse which served the
nearby market town of Llanrwst, the cottage, known locally as ‘the red 
house’, was taken over in the 1930s by two elderly ladies who made money
by inviting locals around for evenings of musical entertainment.

It is now owned by the National Trust 
and leased by Tim Maddox, a former Londoner who escaped the city a 
decade ago to run the tearooms and enjoy a slower pace of life with his 
wife and three children.

The building sits on the edge of the 
Snowdonia national park, alongside an Inigo Jones bridge which straddles
the rushing River Conwy. Mr Maddox, 47, who used to work in publishing,
said: ‘It’s unbelievably picturesque. The trees, the hills and the 
mountains are just breathtaking. The drive as you approach is fantastic.

'The view changes every day. The colours, the trees. I have to remind 
myself not to take it for granted.’

It’s hard to imagine that just three 
weeks ago many of us were bathing in sunshine and 85F heat - but at 
least some areas were still looking beautiful this weekend, ahead of the
start of October.

Rain and
gale force winds are set to batter Britain this week as the miserable 
autumn shows no signs of improvement, after a month that saw parts of 
England experience a 50 per cent rise in rainfall. Flood warnings are 
already in place for today and more may follow as rain falls on already 
soaking ground.

Met Office forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘Northern England had an average of one and half times its monthly rainfall - and temperatures across the country were about half a degree below average.’

However she added that last month’s rainfall across the country was average thanks to the dry and sunny start. Meanwhile, there is more wet weather to come as we enter October tomorrow.

Ms Waite said: ‘It’s still quite unsettled and there is a band of rain moving south through the day (Sunday). It’s also very windy, and there are some gales around the coast and the hills.

‘On Monday there will be scattered showers, most persistent in the North-West and perhaps quite heavy at times. It’s still quite blustery and it’s still looking unsettled.’

It comes after seven kittens, three 
cats and four chickens were rescued by the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on Friday from a property that was 
marooned due to flooding.

The
welfare charity’s chief inspector Mark Gent offered to help after 
hearing the animals’ owner could not get back to their home near 
Stillingfleet, North Yorkshire, because of the high water.

Mr
Gent travelled along a badly-flooded stretch of road to the house, 
where he safely recovered the animals, which included five two-week old 
kittens and two nine-week old kittens.

Meanwhile on Tuesday another band of 
rain will arrive in the UK, which could cause problems on top of the wet
weather already seen in some parts. There will also be strong winds on 
the western coast.

More 
scattered showers are forecast for Wednesday, but there could be some 
sunny spells and it may be a little less windy. Thursday and Friday are 
expected to be reasonably pleasant but crisp.

‘Temperatures
are set to be slightly below average during the day with perhaps some 
frost at night, which is not unusual for October,’ Ms Waite added.
