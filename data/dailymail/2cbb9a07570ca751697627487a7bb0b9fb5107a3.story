A 59-year-old woman buried her husband behind the porch in their backyard in San Bernadino, California because she couldn't afford funeral costs, police reports say.

Yvonne Winn of Apple Valley dug a four- to five-foot hole in the yard of the couple's home and buried her husband Thomas Winn, 63, after he died in late May.

Neighbors who heard of Yvonne Winn's plight have been raising money to help her pay for a proper burial for her husband.

'She seems like such a nice, hard-working, older lady,' neighbor Colin Wilson told the LA Times.

'I could imagine how difficult it might be, just the whole situation. I feel for her.'

According to NBC4, authorities showed up to the home on Wednesday to do a welfare check on Thomas Winn. Yvonne Winn told them she had buried Thomas in the backyard after he died last month.

The body was wrapped in two garbage bags when officials dug it out of the hole in the home's yard Thursday.

According to neighbors, the police spent three hours digging in the backyard of the Winns before exhuming a plastic-wrapped body.

Wilson says Yvonne Winn was visibly upset as police dug up her husband's body.

'She appeared frantic, frustrated. She was definitely bawling, she was 
crying. Just very out of sorts,' Wilson told NBC4, 
describing the smell after the body was dug up as 'rancid'.

After burying her husband, Yvonne Winn attempted to sell the house.

A prospective buyer of the house told NBC4 that he was set to move into the house on July 31st but was now having second thoughts.

Yvonne Winn told the buyer that her husband had died after hitting his head. He'd gone to bed that night but in the morning, she hadn't been able to wake him, the buyer told NBC4.

A spokeswoman for the San Bernadino sheriff's department said there was no suspicion of foul play in the death of Thomas Winn, and a spokesperson for the town said authorities had decided not to penalize Yvonne Winn for the illegal burial.Â 

Neighbors have rallied around Winn in her time of need to raise the money needed to have a proper burial for Thomas Winn.

So far, they've raised $2723 of a $3000 goal.
