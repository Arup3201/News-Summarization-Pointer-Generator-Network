A patient who received the world's first double-leg transplant has had both limbs amputated after being struck down by an unrelated illness, it was confirmed today. 

The man, who was in his 20s when he had the operation in 2011, was forced to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs so he could be treated for the illness.

The Hospital Le Fe, in Valencia, Spain, said the patient has already undergone the operation to amputate both legs.

The double leg transplant was led by surgeon Pedro Cavadas (pictured) but the patient was forced to have the legs amputated after treatment for an unrelated illness meant he had to stop taking his anti-rejection drugs

A statement released by the hospital said the new treatment took precedence over the immuno-suppressant drugs.

A spokesman said: 'In these cases the protocol is that, if the transplanted organ is not a vital organ, it should be removed from the patient so as to allow treatment of the illness that is more serious and urgent', according to AFP. 

The patient, who initially lost his legs above the knees after a road accident, has not been named.

He was given the transplant as he faced life in a wheelchair because attempts to fit him with prosthetic limbs had failed.

The 14-hour milestone transplant was led by Spanish surgeon Pedro Cavadas in 2011.

It was the first leg transplant of any kind.

Valencia's Hospital La Fe said treatment for the illness takes precedence over saving the legs

Fifty surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and other staff at the hospital worked on the operation to give the man the 
legs of another person.

The bones were attached first, followed by tendons, arteries and nerves.

About eight months after the operation, the hospital said the man was recovering well and was able to stand in a swimming pool.

Mr Cavadas also carried out Spain's first face transplant in 2009 and was the first anywhere in the world to include a tongue and jaw.

He has also carried out several arm transplants.
