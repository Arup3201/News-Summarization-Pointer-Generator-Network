It's difficult to understand how this man didn't get his face ripped off.

Not only did he come face-to-face with a fully-grown lion, he washed the big cat with a soapy sponge like it was a car.

The incredible viral footage shows the man, reportedly a Yemeni lion breeder, forcefully scrubbing the animal's head, belly and even genitals - and the lion generally didn't seem to mind.

Incredible: A man believed to be a Yemeni lion breeder is captured on film washing a fully grown lion

Cornered: At one point, the man had the lion up against the concrete wall and scrubbed its head fiercely

At one point, the giant creature jumped up in protest but the fearless man yelled and pushed its head down before resuming the wash.

The man later dragged the lion by its leg when it tried to edge away.

El Arabiya News reported the scene may not be unusual in Yemen, known as a breeding hub for wildlife animals which are sold to rich collectors in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates.

According to a 2013 Guardian report, animal husbandry has become popular and profitable in Yemen, where the price of lion cabs can reach more than $13,000 (50,000 Saudi riyals) each.

'Animal trafficking represents an enormous opportunity to people in one of Yemen's poorest regions,' the reporter Joe Sheffer wrote.

'A loose network has sprung up, trading not just lions but also cheetahs, leopards, gazelles, hyenas and monkeys.'

Unbelievable: When the impatient lion tries to edge away, the man grabs him by the leg and drags him towards the bucket

Death wish: When the lion roars and tries to shrug free himself from the washer, the man pushes his head down and orders him to 'sit down'

Brave: Incredibly, the lion allowed the man to scrub his genitals and didn't flinch

Where's the rubber ducky? The big cat appeared to relish the wash, lying on its back with its legs in the air to let the man scrub his belly
