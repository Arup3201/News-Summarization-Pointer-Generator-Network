A police marksman shot himself dead after rowing with his girlfriend who had cheated on him with a colleague, an inquest heard today.

Colin Smelt, 43, blasted himself in the chest with his police issue Glock pistol he had taken home to his flat in Camden, north London, the hearing was told.

The officer - a member of the elite Special Protection Command unit which protects VIPs including the Prime Minister and the Royal family - was found slumped against his chair in his Met police vest with the semi-automatic pistol by his side when officers forced entry into his home.

Tormented: Armed policeman Colin Smelt, 43, had become suicidal after the failure of his relationship with lover Melissa Jordan, St Pancras Coroner's Court heard

St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard how emotionally fragile PC Smelt did not cope well when romantic relationships broke down - and had a history of threatening suicide.

Yet despite this, he had access to weapons, and previously taken a gun home to practice killing himself, the inquest was told.

And on the day before his death on February 18, this year, he had signed out a pistol from the police armory and taken it home to his flat in Camden, north London.

That evening, PC Smelt had met with on-off girlfriend Melissa Jordan at his flat in Kings Terrace, to see if they could repair their troubled relationship. 

He had wanted to patch things up after learning she had twice cheated on him - once with a member of his police team, but the coroner heard that she wanted to remain friends, the coroner was told.

Breaking into tears several times as 
she gave evidence, Ms Jordan said the next morning she had arranged to 
have dinner with him and said: 'I kissed him on the cheek and said 
goodbye.

'We were texting all day and at 4pm that was the last I heard from him.' Asked what were in the text messages, she said: 'He said "I love you very much".

'He started to apologise to me as if he had done something wrong. I said "but you haven’t don’t anything wrong".'

At 4pm she sent him a text asking if she should go over that night, but she never got a reply. Worried after she didn’t hear from him, she called some of his colleagues to ask them to check on him.

However, Ms Jodan told the hearing that she never thought he would kill himself.

She
said: 'I just didn’t want him taking his motorbike out and driving 300 
miles an hour - I wasn’t thinking he would take his life.'

She said PC Smelt - a keen motorcyclist, skier and scuba diver - was 'outgoing' and had a 'real zest for life'.

But
the inquest heard that he had tried to kill himself three times in one 
night when he was 22 after he split up with a previous girlfriend.

And
he had also rung his ex wife, Louise Richards, in floods of tears 
threatening to kill himself when they were going through one of their 
break-ups.

In a statement 
she said: 'He said he had his gun next to him and he was seriously 
considering ending his life by shooting himself.

'I was so shocked, I told him not to be stupid, that I loved him and we would work something out.

'I told him to come home and we would be alright.'

But she added: 'There was no chance he would concern his superiors and come home or ask for time off.

'Colin didn’t show emotions. He was a closed book.'

PC Smelt 'compartmentalised' his emotions and rarely spoke about his failed suicide bids, the inquest heard.

However,
in an email in January this year he confided in Ms Jordan, telling her 
that he had tried to gas himself and take an overdose of pills when he 
was 22.

He also took a gun 
from his police station and practised pulling the trigger unloaded, but 
couldn’t bring himself to kill himself.

She said: 'He told me dark thoughts that he had never told anyone.

'It was hard for me. He was dealing with a lot of emotions he had never dealt with before. He had just locked it away in a box.

'He said it had never gone that bad since because he said nothing in life is that important enough to kill yourself over. He said it was a selfish thing to do and he was too proud to do it.'

His close friend Detective Sergeant Stephen Crumley said PC Smelt was upset by Ms Jordan cheating on him.

In a statement he said: 'In October 2012 he came to see me and told me that he and Melissa had split up.

'The reason he told me for the split was that they wanted different things.

'It was around December 2012 when I was told that the reason for the split was that Melissa had been seeing someone else. This was the first I had heard of anything.

'He was a very proud person, he did not like to be made a fool of, he committed himself 100 per cent to his relationship with Melissa.

'The final blow was that she had an affair with someone in his own team.'

The inquest heard that all the police equipment was checked and accounted for on February 17th, but at 4.55am the following morning he used his swipe card to get back into his station.

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'He was the consummate professional - he was the person that everybody wanted to work with.

'Everyone knew about his personal problems and wanted to help. They gave him a hug. He was described in terms of being adored.

'It seems incredible that this extraordinary person took his own life.

'He had a lovely family, he had a great job and colleagues that adored him.

'But his romantic life had gone wrong and he was devastated about that.

'Although the majority of those around him never had any inclination, he had attempted to take his own life in the past and this was because of a romantic relationship that had gone wrong.

'I heard that in his last relationship he gave unconditional love.

'He was desperately sad. I think having given that unconditional love and that relationship disintegrating and not returning to what he wanted, I think he decided the only way out he saw was to take his life. And I think that is what he did.'

PC Smelt’s mother, who sat next to his father at the inquest, collapsed in tears as the verdict was announced and was hugged by her daughter, PC Smelt’s younger sister.

A statement from the Metropolitan Police Service said: 'MPS firearms officers undergo rigorous tactical training and regular refresher training.

'This includes self-awareness training for individuals and supervisors and is further supported by annual health screening.

'Protection officers are also subject to the highest vetting levels as part of the robust selection process.

'Steps are taken to ensure that officers are mentally and physically fit for deployment in this role, including regular re-authorisation processes and an annual re-application process, which requests senior officers support for the continued deployment of that officer based upon their line manager's recommendation.'

The police said that PC Smelt was up to date with his assessments and that they have no official reports that Mr Smelt had made previous attempts on his life.

They added that while it was not common practice for officers to take firearms home with them, they could be given permission in exceptional circumstances and would require authorisation from a senior officer.
