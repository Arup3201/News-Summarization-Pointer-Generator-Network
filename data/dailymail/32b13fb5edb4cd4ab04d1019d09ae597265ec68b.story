The teenage mother of a  one-year-old girl in foster care who went missing during a supervised visit has been arrested on suspicion of kidnap after the child was found safe and well, police said today.

Little Lola Page, 13 months, was found with her mother, Stacey Ball, 18, at an address in Willenhall, near Walsall in the West Midlands at 1am today, police said.  The child had been missing since Friday lunchtime, when she disappeared during a visit by her mother to the foster family she had been living with.

Officers arrested Ball and another man at the address where they found them, and a short while later arrested two more men in the village of Walsall Wood, eight miles away.

Ball, from Walsall Wood, was arrested on suspicion of kidnap, and the man she was arrested with is accused of assisting an offender.  The other two men are accused of conspiracy to kidnap.

All four are now in police custody and officers said they were planning to question them later today.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Markham from West Midlands CID said the police had received several calls from members of the public wanting to help them trace the missing girl.

He said: 'We are pleased to say that Lola is now returned to a place of safety and she is doing well.

'We have four people in police custody, helping us with our enquiries, regarding the childâ€™s kidnap and they will be questioned later today.'

Lola was in foster care because of an alleged violent relationship between Miss Ball and Lola's father

West Midlands Police said the child had been 'taken to a place of safety' when they found her this morning

A police hunt for Lola and her mother was launched on Friday after the child, who was in the care of social services, was taken from her foster family during a supervised visit from her young mother.

As police appealed for help in tracing the pair, Ball's father, Ryan Price, 46, said his daughter was upset because she had been told her child would be put up for adoption.

He said: 'She had her baby taken away from her nine months ago and she has seen her three times a week since.

'But
 then when social services told her she was up for adoption she was 
desperate. She didn't think she would see her again and no one was 
listening to her. She has been doing everything that they have asked of her and she is a good mum.

'She loves that baby, she wasn't kidnapping but just doing what any mother would do.'

Social services: Lola's grandfather, Ryan Price, 46, said the toddler had been listed for adoption

Mr Price claimed his daughter became involved with social services because of a violent relationship with the baby's father.

'She has done nothing,' he added. 'She is just a mother screaming out for help.

'We are really worried about her and the baby. She is my granddaughter.'

Over the weekend Lola's
 23-year-old father Stephen Page, who admitted he had not seen his 
daughter 'for about five months', denied acting violently 
towards Miss Ball.

He 
claimed social services had been monitoring Lola since birth because of 
concerns about Miss Ball's family, adding: 'I just want Lola found safe 
and well.'

A message 
on Ball's Facebook page apparently directed at Mr Page from last June hinted at a breakdown in 
their relationship, warning: 'You have lost your daughter and me.'

A second Facebook page in her name states that she worked at 'Play Boy and Play Girl Bunny Entertainment'.
