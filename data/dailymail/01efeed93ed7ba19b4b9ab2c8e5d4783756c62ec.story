Police have released CCTV footage of a suspect who is believed to have killed a man after pushing him  onto a New York subway track. 

Wai Kuen Kwok from the Bronx was shoved off the platform by an unidentified man at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge.

The 61-year-old was struck by a southbound D train at around 8:40 a.m. and pronounced dead at the scene. His wife was not injured.

Authorities have now released images of a potential suspect walking around outside the station.

Danger: Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, of the Bronx was pushed off the platform by an unidentified man at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge, police said

After exiting the station he is wearing a black balaclava before walking around the corner, taking if off and smoking a cigarette. 

Authorities told The New York Post that Kwok's 59-year-old spouse Yow Ho Lee had been transported to Bronx Lebanon Hospital, has since been released and police are interviewing her.

One source told The Post 'She is not injured except for obvious trauma from seeing her husband pushed in front of a train.'

There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had had an altercation with him before he was pushed, police said.

Witnesses told police they believed the man fled the subway station after shoving Kwok and jumped on a city bus. 

A transit source told The New York Daily News '[The subway train motorman] said the guy just flew off the platform in front of his train as he was entering the station. The guy was still in the air when he hit him.' 

The source also told The Daily News that by the time the subway train came to a halt Kwok had already been rolled over by three cars. 

Mystery: There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had an altercation with him before he was pushed, police said

There have been three other incidents in recent years that involved a person being pushed onto the tracks.

In April 2013, a train ran over a man desperately clawing at a Manhattan subway platform after being pushed onto the tracks by a homeless suspect with whom he'd been arguing.

In December 2012, another homeless man was arrested for pushing a Queens straphanger in front of a Times Square train that fatally crushed him.

And later the same month, a mumbling woman pushed a man to his death in front of a subway train in Queens.
