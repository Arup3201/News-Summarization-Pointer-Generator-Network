A monster storm on the sun's surface has unleashed a solar flare in the direction of Earth - and there could be more to come.

The event temporarily blacked out a few radio communication systems before weakening. 

The storm came from a large group of sunspots and hit Earth between 10 am and 11 am EDT (2pm and 3pm BST) yesterday.

An X1.6 class flare erupted from the lower half of the sun today, as seen in the bright flash of light in this image from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This image shows extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 131 Angstroms, which highlights the intense heat of a solar flare

'It would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs,' said Spaceweather.com's Tony Phillips

Space Weather Prediction Center forecaster Christopher Balch, meanwhile, said the flare affected radio that uses part of the upper atmosphere. That includes some but not all radar and plane systems as well as amateur radio.

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. 

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.

Mr Balch said the storm briefly was rated as strong for affecting Earth radio systems but then dropped to minor levels.

The event followed months of near-silent activity on the sun before the huge flare erupted from a sunspot 14 times bigger than Earth.

A spokesperson for the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre told MailOnline it may be the biggest sunspot for 25 years.

But they said in the UK there had been 'no reports of any disruption at all. There may have been short periods of outage in radio communication but nothing has been repotred as causing problems.'

Flares are massive explosions on the Sun associated with sunspots. 

Magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy, but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap, releasing their energy as explosions called flares. 

Sunspot AR12192 is 14 times larger than Earth and almost as big as Jupiter. The Met Office told MailOnline it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years. It is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from Earth's surface (shown in this image from pilot Brian Whittaker)

The light area in the centre of this image is the largest sunspot in this 11-year solar cycle, says the Met Office, and it may also have been the largest sunspot for 25 years

Yesterday's flare was an X1.6, which is a million times the combined yield of every single nuclear weapon on Earth.

'The sun erupted with another significant flare today, peaking at 10:28 a.m. EDT on Oct. 22, 2014,' revealed Nasa.

'Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory captured images of the event, which occurred in the lower half of the sun. 

'This flare is classified as an X1.6 class flare. 

'X-class flares denote the most extreme flares.

'This is the third substantial flare from the same region of the sun since Oct. 19.'

Dr Young of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center added: ‘It continues to grow in size and complexity.'

 

The sunspot group - Active Region 2192 - has doubled in size to become one of the biggest groups in years, and has been described by astronomy experts as ‘menacing’.

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation.

Nasa says, ‘Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, but when intense enough - they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.’

According to experts at thesuntoday.org, 'As of Oct. 22, 2014 (11 UT) the region’s trailing spots have an area of 2410 MH or millionths of a visible solar hemisphere. 

'The largest up until now had been AR11967 on Feb. 5, 2014, measuring 1580 MH. MH is a standard measure used by astronomers for area. 

'Just to provide some scale, the surface area of Earth is 169 MH - this means that AR12192 is 14 times larger than the surface area of Earth.'

According to Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) team a single, dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 August. The two larger flares were M-class (moderate) flares and the others were smaller flares. This animation shows an ejection associated with the flares
