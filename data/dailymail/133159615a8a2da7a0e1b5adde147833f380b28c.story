At his best, Yaya Toure is like a thoroughbred stallion, but you might have forgotten that reading some of the headlines after his performance against Bayern Munich.

OK, he wasn't at his best. His body shape exposes him when he is not at the peak of his powers. An average World Cup, a long return journey from Cameroon after a 4-1 defeat for the Ivory Coast last week - these might be taking their toll.

He was left out of the 18 for the 2-2 draw against Arsenal after his delayed return from Africa, but the rest didn't seem to help him. He still hasn’t rediscovered his sharpness from last season.

Alonso 12.09km (7.51 miles)

Alaba 11.44 (7.11)

Gotze 11.41 (7.09)

Lahm 11.29 (7.02)

Silva 11.10 (7.02)

Navas 11.07 (6.88)

Toure 10.89 (6.77)

Fernandinho 10.65 (6.62)

Sagna 10.37 (6.44) 

His stuttering performance is worthy of scrutiny, but let’s not jump in two-footed here. He’s still a player you want in your team and it’s too soon to be dismissing him.

Jose Mourinho will be aware of his destructive capabilities when Chelsea meet City on Sunday and City will be more of a threat with Yaya in the team. Chelsea will have a gameplan to stop him.

Players can often suffer a World Cup hangover. This time last season, Toure had three goals in five games for City, whereas this time around, he has yet to score.

He looked to be breathing heavily in Germany and, yes, he seemed to leave his midfield sidekick Fernandinho to carry the load against Bayern. However, a look at the running stats from Munich are quite surprising: he covered more distance than his Brazilian team-mate, although both players were left behind by their Bayern rivals (see table above).

There is a difference between appearing to float across the pitch and what seems to be a heavy-footed lumber.

Manuel Pellegrini worked hard on his match sharpness last season and we got to see the best of him. Maybe that is all that he lacks right now.

Players like Toure - and Wayne Rooney also suffers from this - can look lethargic and cumbersome when they are not at the peak of their powers. He was certainly sluggish at times in the Allianz Arena.

I’m not unduly worried, because I’m convinced he can return to the levels of last season.

It has also been pointed out that he was exposed because he played in a midfield two in Germany, but that’s where he spent most of last season. 

The beauty of Yaya is that he can be just as comfortable in a two, or playing more advanced as a second striker.

What is a problem is if he is playing with a bit of a sulk. Does he have his contract issue on his mind?

He is 31, he is contracted to 2017 and, while I remain a huge fan, does he really deserve an extension? City seem pretty smart with their business and Yaya looks to me to be a player who plays better when he is hungry, not when he is comfortable.

Talk of a lack of birthday cake and support after the death of a brother seemed to be a smokescreen to me.

He knows how to play with Fernandinho, who is a good foil for him. Last season, it was was a partnership that allowed him to get forward and score plenty. 

When I interviewed Yaya for Sportsmail, he said this of his fellow midfielder: ‘He’s very clever. Brazilians play pretty, fantastic football and Fernandinho is clever - he anticipates well, he presses well. His movement is so good but he can play with the ball as well. 

'Before he came to City, he was at Shakhtar playing in my position, more as an offensive midfielder. Sometimes we have some difficulties because when he attacks I have to stay more to protect the defence, but we are doing well and he helps me a lot.

'The manager demands a lot from us because he wants us to have more of the ball and he wants us to attack. He doesn’t want to just score and defend.’

When he gets his body right and his mind clear, I still think we are looking at a beast of an operator.

Yes, he needs to pull his finger out. But we know he has the game to do that. He scored 22 goals from midfield last season and was the most influential player as Manchester City won the title.

So before we write him off, let’s take a close look at him against Chelsea at the weekend. Big players are drawn to the big games and while he wasn't at his best in Munich, a heavyweight Premier League encounter is Yaya Toure’s kind of stage.

But Toure should be back to the imperious form he showed last year when he regains match fitness
