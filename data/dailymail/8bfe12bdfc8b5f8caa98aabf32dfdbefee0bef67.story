Jet setter: Thomas Moran, pictured, spent 18 years on the run and raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station

A father who spent 18 years on the run has revealed how he raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station.

Thomas Moran, 51, brought up five children by three different mothers in Ireland and England while evading authorities - despite jetting between the two countries an incredible sixty times.

He was arrested in Northampton in 1993 for possession of drugs and on suspicion of intent to supply - but fled court and returned to his native Ireland during his 18 years as a ‘fugitive’.

Despite officially being wanted by police, he split his time between England and Ireland enjoying sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children.

The grandfather-of-seven was only caught when he moved back to within a mile of Northampton’s police station and officers arrested him at home - where he had been officially registered and was claiming benefits.

The builder - who has now pleaded guilty to the offence - told today of his relief at finally being free of the crime which has hung over his head for 18 years.

He said: 'I had moved to England in 1987 because I needed to get the work.

'But when I was here I fell into a bad crowd and got into drugs and alcohol.

'After my arrest I was moved to a couple of different bail houses but the drugs were still everywhere so I thought I just have to get out of this place.

'So I went back to Ireland to look after my children and raise more kids. We just lived a normal life.

'We would go sightseeing, fishing, do water sports, I even took my youngest kids back to England for holidays but nobody ever said anything to me.

'It was as if they had completely lost me but surely if they wanted to catch me they could have quite easily considering how many times I went through customs.'

Cheeky: Despite being wanted by police, Moran often enjoyed sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children. This is a picture of one of his son's which he took while on the run during a visit to Northampton

Moran had three children from his first marriage but one died when she was a baby in the late 80s.

The two surviving children who live in his home town of Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland, are 34 and 28.

He had a daughter with another woman when he was living in England, who is now 22 and lives in Northampton.

He has two boys with his current English girlfriend who are 15 and 16 - they were conceived when he was in Ireland but are now living in England.

Moran moved back to Northampton in July last year and began claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance.

Police only caught up with him by chance while cross-referencing court records and he was traced through his tenancy agreement.

He was arrested on February 28 at the property which was just over a mile away from the local police station.

His long-term girlfriend and three youngest children are also living in Northampton but at a separate address.

He added: 'I had to come back for work I was getting nothing in Ireland.

'We wanted to rebuild our lives here and have a fresh start.

'I was not sure if the police would still remember me but  I needed the work so I thought I might as well just face the music.'

During a hearing at Northampton Crown Court, Moran pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a class B drug with intent to supply, one count of simple possession and one count of failing to answer bail.

Elizabeth Gooderham, prosecuting, said: 'Moran was granted bail to a hostel in Milton Keynes, returned back to Northampton, then went back to Milton Keynes, moved to Wellingborough and then onto Ireland where he remained until last year.'

But the case was adjourned until April 16 after Judge David Tomlinson ordered Moran’s police records in Ireland to be checked.
