On Boxing Day it was the batsmen and on Saturday the bowlers but Sri Lanka's punishment at the hands of New Zealand remained consistent at the Hagley Oval.

Having seen Brendon McCullum take to their attack as though it were a Twenty20 on day one of this opening Test, the tourists would have hoped for some quality time in the middle on day two.

But, after New Zealand checked out on 441 all out, they quickly collapsed to 138 all out themselves and were forced to bat again in the day.

They fared better then, reaching 84 for none at the close, but remain 219 behind with three days to go.

Dimuth Karunaratne was the first man to go just four balls in for a duck, getting trapped playing across the line by Trent Boult (three for 25).

Kaushal Silva was quickly back with his opening partner, going in the same way to the same man for four.

Kumar Sangakkara was unable to hang around and make things better, caught at third slip for six off Boult to leave his side 15 for three.

Lahiru Thirimanne at least added some runs before he went, making 24 before Tim Southee had him caught at second slip, while Niroshan Dickwella made only two before holing out.

Prasanna Jayawardene got to 10 but hit Neil Wagner to gully, before Angelo Mathews - the only man with credit as he got to 50 - hit Wagner to third man where he was taken.

After that it was over quickly enough, with Tharindu Kaushal (six), Dhammika Prasad (18) and Suranga Lakmal (two) unable to make a better fist of it.

Karunaratne at least made 49 and Kaushal Silva 33 in an unbeaten second knock after New Zealand opted not to bat again immediately, but plenty of work remains to be done.

New Zealand had added only 15 to their overnight score but lost three wickets, Mathews (one) and Lakmal (two) taking them.
