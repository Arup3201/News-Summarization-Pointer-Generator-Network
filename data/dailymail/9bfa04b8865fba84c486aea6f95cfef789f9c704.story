More than one in six civil servants has been sacked under the coalition’s austerity cuts, new figures revealed today.

Since 2010 more than 87,000 staff have been laid off, taking total headcount to under 440,000.

The government boasts that the civil service is now smaller than at any point since the Second World War but unions warn services will suffer.

Deep spending cuts since the 2010 election have cut the deficit from £140billion to around £94billion this year.

While tax rises and benefit cuts have saved billions, big reductions have been made in the number of people on the public sector payroll.

In March 2010, just before the general election, there were 527,500 people employed in the civil service.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics today show the number is down 17 per cent to 439,900.

A Cabinet Office source said: ‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan we are making Whitehall more efficient.

‘This year the Civil Service reached its smallest level since the Second World War with productivity significantly increased since the 2010 General Election.

‘Our overall efficiency reforms helped save taxpayers £14.3 billion last year alone, compared to spending under Labour in 2009-10.’

Overall the number of full-time civil servants fell by 7,353 to 332,692 between March 2013 and March 2014. The number of part-timers fell by 1,540 to 107,250.

Workers classed as being at the ‘administrative responsibility level’ saw the biggest job losses in the last year, down 9.4 per cent.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said cutting civil service jobs is not 'glamorous headline-grabbing stuff' but is needed to cut the deficit

At the same time the number of employees working at the Senior Civil Service responsibility level increased by 11.8 per cent.

There was an increase of 7.9 per cent in the number of Grades 6 and 7 – some of the best paid people in Whitehall - and an increase of 7.3 per cent in the number of Senior and Higher Executive Officers, the ONS said.

The number of people working in the civil service aged over 50 rose, but the number of employees in all other age bands fell.

Cabinet office minister Francis Maude used his speech to the Tory conference last week to insist there was more to do to reduce numbers.

'We’ve cut the size of the Civil Service - down 17 per cent so far, with more to come,' he said. 

'None of this is glamorous headline-grabbing stuff. It’s hard detailed grind. Getting deep into the numbers; asking tough questions; long meetings renegotiating over-rich contracts with some of the biggest companies in the world.

'And it won’t surprise you that not everyone in Whitehall was as enthusiastic as we were. So I’m really grateful to the Prime Minister and Chancellor for their unstinting support for the difficult things we were driving through.

'This is about efficient and effective government, government that cares about public services and cares about the taxpayer.'

The number of civil servants in most regions fell, but in London, the South West and Northern Ireland there were small increases.

The North East, widely seen as one of the regions most reliant on state-funded jobs, saw the largest percentage fall, down 7.8 per cent in the year to March.

Pay also rose in the Civil Service, up by £350 or 1.5 per cent in a year to £24,730.

Next week up to a quarter of a million civil servants will stage a strike in protest at pay restraint and job cuts.

A spokesman for the PCS union said: ‘The focus of the strike next week is pay but we include in that cuts to jobs as well because all of those cuts flow from the decision to cut public spending which we say is not necessary.

‘Where services are being provided to the public, if you cut the number of people doing it, inevitably services will suufer.

‘The headline figures on job cuts are pretty shocking. But if you look at something like the Passport Office, at the start of the summer we saw exactly what the impact of job cuts was.’

Thousands of people faced delays in applying for passports as officials struggled to get a grip on a mounting backlog.
