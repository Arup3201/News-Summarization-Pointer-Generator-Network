It looks like the kind of home owned by a successful businessman or influential politician.

But this imposing five-bedroom house, in one of the most affluent districts of Lahore, Pakistan, is understood to be owned by a man being investigated for benefit fraud in Britain and Denmark.

The opulent two-storey home, worth up to £300,000 in the country’s second-biggest city, is the subject of an investigation by the Department for Work and Pensions and Danish authorities into Hassan Gilani.

Imposing: The £300,000 Lahore house, in one of the most affluent districts in Lahore, owned by Hassan Gilani

Investigators want to know how the father of three, who has allegedly claimed nearly £292,000 of benefits in both Britain and Denmark during the past decade, could afford to keep such a property.

His Pakistani address was included in a file given to the DWP by the Danish authorities following a tip-off that he did not live in Denmark but had been receiving state support since 2002.

Mr Gilani has allegedly been paid huge sums after saying he was disabled and could barely walk, while claiming to live in both countries.

But his neighbours in Pakistan say he is regularly seen strolling round the upper-class neighbourhood of Model Town and that he often spends  several months at a time at the house to escape the cold English winters.

Last week, this newspaper revealed he has received up to £110,000 in housing benefit from the British taxpayer since 1997.

He has also been paid up to £70,000 in disability allowance in the past decade, while banking about £112,000 of benefits in Denmark.

Under investigation: Hassan Gilani, pictured at his home in Croydon

Locals in Lahore told how Mr Gilani, 58, who lives in a taxpayer-funded three-bedroom terrace house in Croydon, South London, bought land for the house in the early Nineties.

In the years that followed, he turned it into one of the smartest homes in this tree-lined street, five miles from Lahore. When The Mail on Sunday first visited the property last week, Mr Gilani’s name, and that of his wife Iffat, 58, were painted in Urdu on a stone plaque outside the house.

But when we returned the following day, after making our initial enquiries, the plaque had been reduced to a pile of rubble on the ground. Only the name Syed Zahur Hussain Gilani, believed to be Mr Gilani’s brother, remained on the entrance to the house.

After identifying a photograph of Mr Gilani, one neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I often see Hassan around the area. He is a good man and always stops to talk about his family and life in general.

‘He is a regular at the local mosque and spends most of his time there if he is not at home watching TV or walking in the park with his family.

‘He was here in the spring last year, but I haven’t seen him for a while. He usually likes to come in the English winter as well because he says the weather is so bad he cannot stand it.’

Local men at the mosque, less than 500 yards from his front door, said  Mr Gilani has often spent many hours chatting to friends and praying.

One said: ‘Hassan is a good man with a very good family. He is always smartly dressed in traditional clothes and gives generously to the mosque.’

Some locals who claimed to know Mr Gilani said they believed he owned the house with his brother, who is also a regular visitor.

When members of the Gilani family are staying at the house they have up to four staff, including a cook, a driver and a gardener.

 Other Model Town residents include bankers, judges and senior government workers and almost all of the houses in the area are gated, many with armed guards outside the high-walled homes.

The smart self-contained town is a world away from the bustling markets and shanty towns nearby.

Most blocks have their own mosques at the end of the road and two former prime ministers, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, have also kept homes in the area.

A man who was at the house last Thursday when a Mail on Sunday reporter called said he lived there with his wife and daughter and that they were responsible for looking after the house and the Gilani family when they were in Pakistan.

He said: ‘Hassan was supposed to come in November last year, but he didn’t for some reason.

‘He usually spends the winters here, sometimes for a few weeks  at a time, but I don’t know when he  will be back.’

Mr Gilani, originally from Pakistan, faces up to seven years in jail in Britain if he is found guilty of misleading social services to claim state support. He could also face charges of fraud in Denmark.

It is alleged he was paid incapacity benefit in Britain from 1999 to 2002, totalling £4,900 a year, and also banked an estimated £112,000 of benefits in Denmark since 2002.

Mr Gilani, seen earlier this month strolling to the bank and a branch of Western Union near his Croydon house, has also received up to £2,700 a year of income support in Britain since 2002 and as much as £5,000 a year in disability living allowance since 2005.

Tip off: Authorities in Copenhagen were told that Gilani had not been seen at his house for more than two years

Mr Gilani has told social workers in Britain and Denmark that he can barely walk and has severe difficulty with basic tasks such as eating and dressing himself.

It is believed Mr Gilani may have also rented out his taxpayer-funded, three-bedroom apartment in Copenhagen while he has not lived there, netting up to an extra £800 a month.

A DWP source in Britain said: ‘Investigators will certainly want to know how Mr Gilani has been able to afford to keep such a large house in Pakistan with no income other than his benefits. This will all form part of any case against him.’

On Friday, a new paper-shredder was delivered to Mr Gilani’s home in Croydon.

However, when The Mail on Sunday knocked at the door, there was initially no answer.

After five minutes a man opened the door and asked our reporter who he represented.

When details of the house in Lahore were put to him, he said the family had made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission and were advised not to talk to reporters.

Asked if Mr Gilani was at home, the man refused to answer.
