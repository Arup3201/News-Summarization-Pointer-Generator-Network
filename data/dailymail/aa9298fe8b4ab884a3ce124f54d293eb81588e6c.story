A group of wealthy car enthusiasts bored with Lamborghinis and Ferraris have teamed up to build their own ultimate supercar - a road legal Batmobile.

The men, who call themselves Team Galag, regularly compete in the infamous Gumball 3000 rally where the rich drive across Europe in the world's most exotic cars.

But this year they have decided to take part in a road legal replica of the legendary Tumbler driven by Christian Bale in the Dark Knight trilogy.

The ultimate supercar: The road legal £1 million Batmobile Tumbler replica which will be taking part in the Gumball 3000 rally

To the Batmobile: A group of anonymous and very wealthy car enthusiasts who call themselves Team Galag jointly funded the building of the car

The car, built in Florida by Parker Brothers, is understood to have cost around £1 million and will be unveiled in London later this month.

After being shown off in the capital, the Tumbler will head off to Copenhagen, Denmark, for the start of the 3,000 mile rally.

Team Galag is made up of a number of anonymous car enthusiasts aged between 21 and 34, hailing from the UK, Germany, America and Saudi Arabia.

One member said: 'The main reason behind doing the Tumbler was that we wanted to bring back a little originality and fun to the Gumball 3000, something it was always known for.

'We wanted to capture the spirit of movies and cartoons such as Cannonball and Wacky Races, while keeping with the cool and rock and roll image of the rally. 

In action: The Tumbler replica has a 6.2-litre V8 engine and can reach a top speed of 100mph

'Gumball 3000 has had just about every Ferrari, Bugatti and Lamborghini built over the past 30 years participate.

'Car number 74 is not your regular supercar, it is none other than the Batmobile Tumbler from the Dark Knight movies.

'Who cares that it weighs 2.5 tonnes and is wider than a truck, it is certain to turn heads and blow eardrums all the way from Copenhagen to Monte Carlo.'

It has been built as a near-exact replica of the Tumbler, which was driven by Batman in the Dark Knight trilogy.

The vehicle has a 6.2-litre V8 engine, which develops around 400bhp - giving the machine a top speed of 100mph.

Anticipation: The replica has not been seen on the road yet and is believed to be first of its kind

The entrants will then drive to Stockholm, Helsinki, St Petersburg, Tallinn, Riga, Warsaw, Krakow and Vienna before ending the rally in Monaco in time for the F1 grand prix.

A spokesperson for Gumball 3000 said: 'This is the most ambitious vehicle ever built for Gumball 3000.

'Team Galag, who have built the Tumbler, are regular Gumballers and this year decided to push boundaries further than ever before.

'The response to the Tumbler has been overwhelming, having not released the spec or been seen on the road yet. Stay tuned to this year's rally to see it in action.'
