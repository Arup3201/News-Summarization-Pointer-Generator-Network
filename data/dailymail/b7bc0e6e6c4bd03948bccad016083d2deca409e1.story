A Neo-Nazi group created a perverted board game based on Monopoly where Jewish people get sent to death camps so they could pass the time between murders.

The game, where the winner is the person who deports the most to the gas chambers, has featured at the trial of 'Nazi bride' Beate Zschape in Munich.

Zschape, 39, is allegedly the sole-surviving member of the National Socialist Underground neo-Nazi death squad which allegedly murdered nine immigrant businessmen and a female police officer in Germany in a 13-year reign of terror which also included bank robberies, bombings and weapons seizures.

The gang called the game 'Pogromly' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against Jews in Russian and eastern Europe over several centuries

The NSU is a far-right German terrorist group which was uncovered in November 2011.

They have been accused of a series of murders of nine immigrants in 2006, murdering a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague, the Cologne bombings in 2001 and 2004 and 14 bank robberies.

In January last year, Beate Zschape was committed to trial accused of ten counts of murder.Miss Zschäpe, who denies the charges against her, has refused to give evidence.

She has been described as a quiet woman who kept her political views to herself.

The gang called the game 'Pogromly' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against Jews in Russian and eastern Europe over several centuries - and features a skull wearing a German helmet in the centre of the board, S.S. runic flashes and plenty of swastikas.

Prosecutors at the Munich trial of Zschape and several accomplices say she and her now-dead NSU sidekicks invented the game to pass away the time between assassinations and robberies.

The aim of the game was to annihilate Jewish life in German cities and send Jews to death camps.

It became a major exhibit on day 85 of the trial which is the biggest neo-Nazi process ever heard in postwar Germany. 

Prosecutors said Zschape invented it with gang members - and her lovers - Uwe Boehnhardt, 34, and Uwe Mundlos, 38.

Both of them committed suicide two years ago after a botched bank raid, leaving Zschape to torch their hideout.

The gang allegedly hoped that by randomly murdering immigrants they would force hundreds of thousands of people to leave Germany for their homelands.

A police officer who investigated the game told the court: 'The idea was to get Jew-free towns.'

Instead of the four railway stations that feature on every Monopoly board the gang had the name of four notorious concentration and death camps: Auschwitz, Dachau, Ravensbrueck and Buchenwald.

Chance and Community Chest cards had instructions like: 'Go to the next concentration camp and hand in the captured Jews and make the owner pay twice the normal rent.' 

On another: 'You fought off a horde of red lice using a machine gun.  Reward; 2,000 Reichsmark.'

The gang made several copies of the game which they sold to far-right fanatics themselves across Germany for around £80 a game.

The proceeds went towards financing their life underground as they carried out their murder missions.

The indictment against Zschape states that the helped devise the game 'in an insidious way and identifying completely with the genocide of the Jews in the Third Reich.'

The trial continues.
