Television adverts teaching children how to cross roads safely have been scrapped for the first time in six decades despite a rise in the number of deaths.

Campaigns featuring characters such as Tufty the Squirrel and the Green Cross Code man have helped save thousands of lives.

But warnings about the dangers of traffic will become a thing of the past after budget cuts forced the Department for Transport to ditch TV and cinema adverts.

Helping hand: Tufty the Squirrel became so popular that a nationwide Tufty Club was formed, which at its height had a staggering two million members

Pressure groups last night called on Ministers to reverse the decision. Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: ‘While road safety must face its share of cuts, road accidents are an enormous financial burden that the country can ill afford.

‘Investing in preventing road casualties makes a significant economic contribution and helps save lives and prevent injuries.’

Dave Prowse, who played the Green Cross Code man for more than a decade, said: ‘We had a fantastic effect on reducing road accident figures and we need the same thing now as the traffic situation is worse than ever.’

He pointed out the Government could save money by simply repeating old public information films in which he starred as a white and green-clad superhero who appeared by busy roads to stop children being hit by cars.

Shadow Transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘This Government must take responsibility if these cuts mean more children are killed or injured on our roads.’

The first road-safety film was broadcast in 1948 to teach people how to use zebra crossings. Five years later a character called Tufty Fluffytail was introduced by RoSPA to teach children how to cross the road. Later clips featured puppets and were narrated by actor Bernard Cribbins.

End of the road: The budget for road-safety publicity was as high as £19m in 2008/09 but was slashed to just £3.9m in 2011/12 for campaigns such as the Tim Burton-style animation called Tales Of The Road

Tufty became so popular that  a nationwide Tufty Club was formed, which at its height had a staggering two million members.

In the Seventies, celebrities including footballer Kevin Keegan and the then Doctor Who, Jon Pertwee, were brought in to appeal to older children, while the  Green Cross Code man taught pupils to ‘stop, look and listen’ before stepping off the pavement.

More recent campaigns have featured cartoon hedgehogs singing the Bee Gees’ hit Stayin’ Alive and Tim Burton-style animations called Tales Of The Road.

Shadow Transport Secretary: Maria Eagle says the Government must take responsibility if the cuts mean more deaths and injuries on the roads

By the mid-Nineties, 260 children were killed on Britain’s roads every year. By 2010, the number had fallen to 55 but in 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, it rose to 60.

A Freedom of Information request has shown that the budget for road-safety publicity was as high as £19 million in 2008/09. However, after the Coalition came to power spending was slashed, and in 2011/12 the Department for Transport spent £3.9 million on the issue.

This year, the publicity budget for the Think! road-safety campaign is £3.6 million, much of which was spent on a Christmas blitz on drink-drivers. A further £1.3 million is being spent on adverts warning drivers to look out for motorcyclists, while just £78,000 will go on keeping children safe. 

Neil Greig, of the Institute of Motorists, said the amount was ‘derisory’. ‘If the Government is serious about safety, it must increase these amounts,’ he said.

The Department for Transport said Tales Of The Road would continue to be available online alongside some interactive content.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Road deaths are at a record low but we know that one death is one too many, which is why we are focusing our campaigns where they will have the greatest impact.

‘We are working to ensure road-safety messages are reaching children and teenagers in schools as well as providing educational resources to allow these important messages to be incorporated into the curriculum.’
