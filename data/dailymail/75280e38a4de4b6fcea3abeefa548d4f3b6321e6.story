There may not be a drop of snow in sight but that hasn't stopped 190 Australian dog sled enthusiasts banding together to race in their own 'dry' version of the traditional winter sport.

Forget the sleds used to compete in the Arctic regions of the United States, Canada and Russia - in Northern Victoria people jump on specially imported scooters and homemade vehicles, adapted from $1000 mountain bikes, for the fast and furious races.

And it's not just the ordinary dog sled racing breeds, such as the Alaskan malamute, Alaskan husky and Siberian husky, that take part in the competition.

There are also German short-haired pointers, English pointers and newcomers - the crossbreed eurohounds, imported specifically to race.

Speedy: One dog driver or 'musher' with four Nordic pooches takes to the dirt track for the Northern Victorian Sled Dog Classic race on Monday

The largest dry land dog sled race in Australia has taken place on dirt tracks at Moira Park, Kialla West, just outside of Shepparton, over the Queen's birthday weekend for 24 years.

The dogs and their speed-loving owners pitch up at the starting line for the Grand Prix of dry sled and set of at 30 second staggered starts to avoid dramatic crashes.

'The dogs love it they race each other, they are very competitive,' Vaughan Winther, a committee member for the Northern Victorian Sleddog Club, told Daily Mail Australia.

The 45-year-old has helped organise the colourful races for the past three years.

'There are accidents out there,' he warned, but said in the open class - for the experienced racers - there are hardly ever collisions.

And this is no sedentary sport - the top dogs whizz around the track at 30/35kmph.

The winning hounds will complete the 2.2km course in just 4 minutes.

'They're pretty quick,' Mr Winther noted as he explained how the dry races are in fact faster than the traditional snow races.

'It's quicker than snow. Snow tends to be slower because the dogs have to drag a sled.'

Mr Winther and his wife joined together with five friends to keep the races going after the former committee decided to call it a day after 21 years, in 2011.

'We didn't want it to be lost,' he explained.

When he first got involved with the unusual Australian take on the sport 12 years ago, he bought just one dog - a Nordic breed - but now he has 16 of them.

'Once the kids got older - they are now 15 and 12 - they wanted to join in too.'

The owners and their dogs get into shape for the competition with bootcamps at the beginning of the season and Mr Winther said it's important you don't pile on too many pounds over summer, as it will only slow the dogs down.

There are usually three heats but the Saturday night heat this year was cancelled because it was too hot for the dogs to race

'We can't run over 15 degrees - the welfare of the dogs is paramount... and they can overheat if we run over 15.'

Instead, this year, just two races were held - on Sunday and Monday morning.

Winners of the sprint race receive the coveted title, a trophy, a $50 cash prize and a goody bag filled with treats for them and their pooch.

There are also encouragement awards, hard luck awards and sportsmanship awards.
