A third-grade teacher who won $150,000 in an online contest has given her entire winnings to her school.

Nikki Bollerman, 26, won the sum as part of Capital One's #WishForOthers competition, which asked people to submit ideas of what they would like to do for others this holiday season.

Bollerman, who teaches at UP Academy Dorchester in Boston, said that she wished for every one of her students to be able to take home a book so that they could experience the joys of reading.

As well as giving her the money, Capital One also granted her wish, and every child was given three books: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, My Father's Dragon and Where the Wild Things Are.

Celebration: Nikki Bollerman poses with some of her students and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh after she won a $150,000 prize from Capital One and then donated it back to the charter school where she works

She was honored this week by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh after donating her prize back to the school, which is only a year old. Governor Deval Patrick also sent her a letter.

'I want to thank Nikki for your kindness and your humility, and you are certainly a shining example of great things to the city of Boston,' Walsh said at the press conference. 'We are grateful for your hard work and generosity. You have inspired lots of people with your selfless act.' 

Bollerman told ABC News that it giving away the money seemed like the natural choice. 

'I really made the wish for my students and I was blessed, lucky and thankful that Capital One gave me the opportunity,' she said. 'Since I made the wish for my students I thought I would do something to make their lives better rather than spend it on myself.'

In her winning entry, she wrote: 'My #wishforothers is that my voracious, adorable, hardworking, loving scholars all leave for their December break with a book in their hand.' 

Joy: For her entry for the competition, she made a wish that all of her students would go home with a book over Christmas and in a video made by Capital One, she can be seen handing them out to the children

Emotional: Bollerman, 26, became emotional as she handed out the books to her third-grade class

Considerate: She said she had made the wish for the children so it seemed right they would get the money

Capital One also shared a video of the moment her children were presented with the books.

'I tried not to cry,' she said in the video as she was seen giving out the packages to her excited students. 'I really just wanted them to have books of their own.' 

Bollerman said she wants the money to be used on better computer access and coding lessons for the children.

She told ABC that because she wanted every child in the school to go home with a book - not just her class - she and her mother bought each child in other classes a book as well.  

'We are so proud of Nikki, her fellow teachers, and all of our scholars,' the school wrote on its website. 'Thank you for all that you do!'
