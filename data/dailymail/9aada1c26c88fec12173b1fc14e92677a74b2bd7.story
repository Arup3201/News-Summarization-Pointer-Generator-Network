Police knocked on the door of the home where three missing girls were held captive for a decade - but left when no one answered, it was revealed today.

Officers visited the home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004 as part of a child services' investigation.

Police had been alerted to the man living at the home, Ariel Castro, now a suspect in the abduction, after he inadvertently left a boy at a bus depot while working as a school bus driver. No criminal charges were brought and no follow-up inquiries made.

Amanda Berry, 26, and Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, escaped the home on Monday night, where it is believed they had been chained for ten years. 

Questions will now be asked as to how police and federal investigators failed to find the girls who remained undetected at the home just three miles from the block where they all went missing.

A neighbor of accused kidnapper Ariel Castro has revealed that she saw a naked woman in his backyard two years ago and reported the incident to police

Ariel Castro has lived in the house since 
1992. His two brothers - Pedro, 54, and O'Neal, 50, - do not live at the
 home but were arrested in connection with the three abductions.

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson also told a news conference on Tuesday that police responded to the west side home in 2000 following a disturbance in the street.

Authorities said that public records show no complaints or building violations at the Seymour Avenue home. There is also no record of any emergency service or fire department calls.

On Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.'

Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families.

Last July, an empty lot on the west side of Cleveland was excavated for the body of Amanda Berry by forensic crews working on a tip from a convict.

The small lot on West 30th Street and Wade Avenue -  which is two blocks from the Seymour Avenue home where the women were held - turned up nothing.

At the time, a local resident named Pedro Castro told Fox 8 that the search was 'a waste of money'.

Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old
 when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house
 near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue.

Three
 years later, in April 2003, Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her
 job at a Burger King - at West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day 
before her 17th birthday.

And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain.

All three were found safe on Monday night after Berry bolted from a home on Seymour Avenue, about three miles from where they were last seen.

She told police that she and the other girls were being held prisoner by Ariel Castro, 52, who has been arrested along with his two brothers on suspicion of kidnapping.

The exact circumstances of the abductions is currently unclear, and it is not known whether or not the kidnapper deliberately targeted the block where all three victims were taken.

The story of Amanda and Gina's 
disappearance has been well known in the area for the past decade, as 
their relatives have continually held vigils and kept the story alive in
 the press.

Michelle's case was less high profile - she was 18 at the time of her disappearance on Aug. 23, 2002 and was last seen at a cousin's house near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue.

Michelle was not officially registered as missing on the Ohio Police Missing Persons website.

Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, told
 the Plain Dealer that some family members had concluded, based in part 
on suggestions by police and social workers at the time, that she had 
run away after he son was removed from her custody.

But mother Barbara Knight told Cleveland.com that long after police stopped searching, she kept the hunt up for her daughter handing out fliers on Cleveland's West Side.

She told them that several years ago she believes she saw her daughter walking with an older man at a shopping plaza on West 117th Street.

She said that she shouted out her daughter's name but the woman, who was being pulled along by her companion, did not turn around.

Ms Knight, told the newspaper she never believed her daughter
 would have vanished without a trace on her own and that she kept 
searching long after police gave up looking for her.

'I'm praying that if it is her, she 
will come back with me, so I can help her recover from what she has been
 through,' the mother was quoted as saying.

'So much has happened in 
these 10 years. She has a younger sister she still has not met.'

Search: Amanda Berry disappeared on April 21, 2003, a day before her 17th birthday

Three years later Amanda Berry disappeared on April 21, 2003, a day before her 17th birthday.

Amanda vanished shortly after she called her sister to say that she was 
getting a ride home from her job at Burger King.

Amanda's mother, Louwana Miller, who had been hospitalized for months with pancreatitis and other ailments, died in March 2006 aged 44.

She
 had spent the previous three years looking for her daughter, whose 
disappearance took a toll as her health steadily deteriorated, family 
and friends said.

Councilwoman Dona Brady said she had spent many hours with Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive.

'She literally died of a broken heart,' Ms Brady said.

In April 2004, Miller turned to a psychic on Montel Williams’ nationally syndicated television show.

The psychic, Sylvia Browne said She’s not alive, honey.'

'Your daughter’s not the kind who wouldn’t call.'

Browne said she envisioned Amanda’s jacket in a Dumpster with 'DNA on it.'

Miller went back to the West Side home where she had been keeping Amanda’s things in careful order and cleaned up.

This is the Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue where Amanda Berry was last seen in April 2003. The other two girls were also last seen on the same block

She gave away her daughter’s computer and took down her pictures. 'I’m not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told local newspaper Cleveland.

In 2009, Wisconsin investigators believed there were striking similarities between Amanda and the body found by deer hunters.

But  test results comparing Amanda's DNA and that of the body came back negative.

In January, a prison inmate was sentenced to four and a half years after admitting he provided a false burial tip in the disappearance of Berry.

A judge in Cleveland sentenced Robert Wolford on his guilty plea to obstruction of justice, making a false report and making a false alarm.

Last summer, Wolford tipped authorities to look for Berry's remains in a Cleveland lot. He was taken to the location, which was dug up with backhoes.

Two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of  in 2004 were released from the city jail in 2006 after officers didn't find her body during a search of the men's house.

One of the men was transferred to the Cuyahoga County Jail on unrelated charges, while the other was allowed to go free, police said.

Missing: Gina DeJesus, aged 14, went missing on April 2, 2004, on her way home from Wilbur Wright Middle School on Parkhurst Drive

A year after Georgina DeJesus, then 14, disappeared on her way home from Wilbur Wright Middle School  on Parkhurst Drive.

Known as Gina, the seventh-grader in special education classes, was last seen near a payphone in Cleveland in mid-afternoon on 2 April 2004 with a classmate.

The pair had called the friend's mother asking for a sleepover at the Gina's house, but when the girl's mother said no the pair parted ways. 

'I gave her the $1.25 to catch the bus because it was cold outside,' said her mother, Nancy Ruiz.

But she has 'the tendency to walk home and use the money for' after-school snacks, she explained.

A bloodhound tracked her scent a 
block from the corner of West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue, where she 
was last seen, to West 104th Street, then the trail went cold.

Gina’s cousin Sylvia Colon told local press in 2004 that her father, Felix, was 'beyond desperate' to bring her home. 

Ruiz’s yard and house in the 3700 block of West 71st Street become a shrine for Gina.

She lit candles on her porch on a nightly basis and prayed for the safe return of her daughter.

Victim: Last year, Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz raised concerns that her daughter might have been the victim of human trafficking

Two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of DeJesus in 2004 were released from the city jail in 2006 after officers didn't find her body during a search of the men's house.

One of the men was transferred to the Cuyahoga County Jail on unrelated charges, while the other was allowed to go free, police said.

In September 2006, police acting on a tip tore up the concrete floor of the garage and used a cadaver dog to search unsuccessfully for DeJesus' body.

Investigators confiscated 19 pieces of evidence during their search but declined to comment on the significance of the items then.

Last year, Ginas' mother Nancy Ruiz raised concerns that her daughter might have been the victim of human trafficking.

'I always said it from the beginning; she was sold to the highest bidder,' she said.

Just two months ago there was a vigil to mark the ninth anniversary of her disappearance.
