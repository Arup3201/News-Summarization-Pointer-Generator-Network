A sadistic loner who went on the rampage after his benefits were cut, battering two men to death with a ‘caveman’s club’ and attacking five others, was jailed for 35 years yesterday.

Ali Koc, 30, spent a month stalking parks and woodland in North London pouncing on joggers and dog walkers.

He beat them with lumps of wood, head-butted, punched and kicked them after selecting them entirely at random.

The cannabis addict, who spent his days watching violent films and smoking drugs, embarked on his terrifying campaign after becoming enraged that his Jobseeker’s Allowance had been stopped due to an administrative error.

Days later he donned a pair of gloves emblazoned with a skull and crossbones logo and left his home in Hornsey, North London, to go on the prowl for victims.

His first, Victor Parsons, 67, died seven weeks after being battered by Koc with a branch shaped like a ‘caveman’s club’ in Alexandra Park.

Weeks later, Keith Needell, 84, was savagely beaten with a piece of wood in daylight. The retired quantity surveyor never recovered consciousness and died six months later.

Koc also attacked five other strangers aged 29 to 85, including a solicitor and a scientist.

Police fear the jobless Turkish immigrant, who lived on benefits and petty crime after his family came to Britain in 1990, may have attacked scores of others during his 26-day rampage in January last year.

Yesterday a judge at Woolwich Crown Court ordered him to serve at least 35 years after heart-rending testimony from his victims’ relatives.

In an impact statement which left jurors sobbing, Keith Needell’s son John said of Koc: ‘I see an individual in the dock not adding to society but taking money, support and other people’s lives and happiness with a disdain for others.

‘His selfish nature is so completely opposite to my father that I wonder how he could even be part of the same species as the rest of humanity.

‘Frankly I pity him for what is obviously such a bleak and pointless existence. A weak individual that can offer nothing positive to anyone, not even himself.’

Mr Justice Calvert-Smith told Koc the unprovoked attacks illustrated the ‘diverse nature of London’s population and the best and worst of its citizens’.

He said: ‘This was a brutal campaign of violence carried out for the sake of showing you could intimidate and hurt other human beings.’

He said: ‘This was a brutal campaign of violence carried out for the sake of showing you could intimidate and hurt other human beings.’

Throughout the hearing, Koc glared at the judge with what one witness had described as a ‘thousand-yard stare’. Members of his family, who claimed he had become mentally unstable after becoming hooked on cannabis, howled in anguish as he was taken from the court.

The court heard Koc’s benefits were stopped in December 2010 and he was unable to draw out cash on January 5 last year. He fatally attacked his first victim, Mr Parsons, hours later.

He was caught only after he made an abusive 999 phone call to complain about the Department of Work and Pensions and officers investigated other racially abusive calls he had made to the department.

One was 30 minutes before he fatally attacked Mr Needell.

His criminal record included 18 convictions for assault, burglary, possession of cannabis and possession of a knife.

This week he was convicted of two murders and five counts of grievous bodily harm after a month-long trial.

Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield of the Metropolitan Police said: ‘This was simply violence for violence’s sake. Koc is a highly dangerous and predatory individual who derived some warped sense of gratification from carrying out these abhorrent attacks.’
