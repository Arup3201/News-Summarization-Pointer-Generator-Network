Everyone indulges at Christmas, with an extra roast potato here, another glass of eggnog there.

And the very thought of squeezing your festive curves into a sexy party dress just six days later on New Year's Eve is enough to make most women reach for the leftover brandy butter.

So it's little wonder George at Asda have reported a 78 per cent sales spike in their 'sexy' controlwear range, and revealed expected sales of more than five million pairs of knickers before New Year.

Fight the festive curves: We all indulge at Christmas, so Asda's answer is their Bodysculpt range from George, and the brand expect to sell over five million pairs of knickers before New Year

It seems women all over the country are emulating celebrity fans of control-wear such as Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook, Tulisa and Beyonce, with George's new Bodysculpt line of control-wear is proving so popular that Asda is seeing almost 700,000 pairs of knickers flying off shelves every day, and are having to restock stores daily.

George is set to sell 5.5 million pairs of knickers ahead of the New Year, and it's their £6 leopard print briefs that are the brand's top seller - understandable when revealed that a survey by George showed three quarters of female shoppers envy the hourglass figure of Kelly Brook.

A spokesman for the brand said: 'The briefs, which aim to tuck in tums and streamline hips, are a welcome change from the usual beige 'Bridget Jones style' control pants and have seen an individual sales increase of 85 per cent week on week since their launch in store and online, with three pairs being sold per minute.'

The matching £6 leopard print bra has also seen a flurry of sales both in store and online, as women stock up on underwear that is not only worth getting undressed for but also slims down the silhouette.

This figure-fixing range uses George's Bodysculpting technology, and claims to 'smooth curves, creating more toned silhouettes for women of all sizes'.

The glamorous collection comprises beautifully detailed control briefs, bodies, dresses, slips, skirts, waist-cinchers and bras that cater for every occasion the festive season holds, each at fantastic value.

Fiona Lambert, George Brand Director said: '64 per cent of women have told us that controlwear helps increase their confidence levels at Christmas and New Years Eve parties.

'For that reason, it comes as no surprise that we are set to sell nearly 70,000 pairs of knickers every day during the Autumn/Winter season.

'We have been overwhelmed by the popularity of the range and will be upping the stock levels across the country to ensure all shoppers will be able to get the confidence boost they need this party season and in the New Year.'
