Hundreds of people gathered to pay tribute to former Queensland Labor Premier Wayne Goss at a public memorial service to celebrate his life.

Mr Goss, who was premier from 1989 to 1996, died at home in Brisbane in the early hours of November 10 at the age of 63 after a long battle with brain cancer.

The family held a private funeral service for him earlier in the week but the public was invited to attend Birsbane's Gallery of Modern Art  to pay tribute on Friday.

Central to the tributes offered about Mr Goss  was his political success at the 1989 state election and the political ideals of transparency, accountability and equality on which he had fought.

He ended the controversial Bjelke-Petersen era in Queensland, when he became the state's first Labor premier after 32 years of National Party rule.

But it was not just Wayne Goss the progressive politician who was remembered.

His personal characteristics - punctuality, meticulous organisation, a sense of humour and a commitment to stand up for what's right - also made him a successful lawyer, businessman, father and husband.

Mr Goss's friend Matt Foley, who served in his government as attorney-general, described him as someone who didn't let friendship get in the way of politics, or politics get in the way of friendship.

'Wayne was by nature a shy, sensitive, courageous person who enjoyed music and the arts - like a cross between (wartime prime minister) John Curtin and (Rolling Stones frontman) Mick Jagger,' Mr Foley said, to laughter from the 1000 or so people at the service at Brisbane's Gallery of Modern Art.

Mr Goss's wife Roisin received a standing ovation after giving her tribute to her husband, who she said approached his 17-year long battle with brain cancer with 'utter dignity, grace and tenacity'.

His daughter Caitlin said her father tackled life like he would a running race - by never stopping, setting a good pace and being prepared.

Former deputy prime minister Wayne Swan, who served as Mr Goss's campaign director during the 1989 election, praised his former boss's wit and sense of humour.

He recalled a time during a trade mission to Germany when he took time out of his schedule to go for a run and his hosts lined up an 'Olympic 5000m champion' to race against him.

'Wayne gets back, he's looking pretty exhausted, he was asked how he went and he said: 'I let him win, I didn't want to cause a diplomatic incident',' Mr Swan said to laughter.

A who's who of Queensland politics were in attendance, including Premier Campbell Newman and former premiers Anna Bligh, Peter Beattie and Rob Borbidge.

Other dignitaries included former judge and corruption fighter Tony Fitzgerald and former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce.
