The Colorado rock slide that killed five hikers on Monday claimed three members of a respected family, along with two cousins who were visiting from Missouri, it was revealed today.

Gracie Johnson, 13, was the sole survivor after her father heroically pushed her out of the way of 100 tons of boulders that came loose from the mountain and tumbled onto a hiking trail near Buena Vista, Colorado.

Gracie's mother and father Dwayne and Dawna Johnson, ages 46 and 45, were killed, along with her 18-year-old sister Kiowa Raine Johnson and cousins Baigen Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22, from Birch Tree, Missouri.

Gracie, who was flown to Children's Hospital of Denver with a broken leg, is one of only two members of her family of five left alive.

Daughter Kiowa, 18, (left); mother Dawana, 45, (second from left) and father Dwayne, 47, (right) were killed. Gracie, 13, (second from right) was rescued. Dakota, 20, (seated) was not with the family at the time

Friends said 'everybody' in town knew the family. Dawna and Dwayne once owned a restaurant in town. Dakota was a star football player before he graduated last year

Paris Walkup, 22, was visiting his aunt and uncle in Colorado and died in the rock slide, as well

Her brother Dakota, 20, no longer lives in Buena Vista, but was rushing back to town to be with his sister, the Denver Post reports.

Dwayne was an assistant football coach at Buena Vista High School, as well as an electrician and landscaper.

Dawn coached track at the high school, was a photographer and a popular waitress at a restaurant in town.

'Everyone knows this family. Everyone who was involved in football knew Dwayne,' Brian Dengler, the pastor at Cornerstone Church, told the Post.

'The whole family, they were gregarious. Very outgoing. Very active in the community. Kiowa just turned 18. Dwayne was so proud of his girl. Just an amazing, amazing family.'

On Tuesday, emergency workers returned to the perilous mountainside at Agnes Vaille Falls near Mount Princeton -
 130 miles southwest of Denver.

The short mile-and-a-half trail is popular with families and is known as one of the easiest hikes around.

The Johnson family took advantage of a clear, beautiful day Monday - following days of rain and clouds previously - to take their visiting family members Baigen and Paris for a hike.

Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Nick 
Tolsma was among the first officials to respond to the scene of the 
collapse, where he discovered Gracie alive under a rock. 

'I heard a scream next to me. I saw a hand sticking out underneath the boulder,' Tolsma told ABC News. 'The
 true hero is her dad. She said her dad jumped on her to protect her at 
the last moment when the rocks were coming down. I think he saved her 
life.'

Geologists believe that the downpour of rain that the area received recently, combined with the onset of frost - which froze and thawed the ground, likely caused the massive rock slide - which loosened boulders the size of cars and let loose an estimate 100 tons of rubble.

Rescuers: One 13-year-old girl was flown to a hospital after being pulled from the rubble. Her condition is not known

Sheriff Pete Palmer called off the recovery operation Monday night because the area is too unstable and experts fear another rock slide.

'They are in bad shape. They were rolled over by boulders as big as these cars,' Palmer told reporters.

'There is no one alive up there.'

Sheriff's department spokeswoman Monica 
Broaddus said rescuers left the mountain before dark Monday. She said 
the recovery effort would wait until likely Tuesday afternoon, after an 
engineer could survey the slide area to make sure it's safe to remove 
the bodies.

The sheriff confirmed that Gracie Johnson was hiking with her family.

The
 disaster happened about 11am. Rescuers were forced to retreat shortly 
after the rock slide, over fears that even more boulders could come 
crashing down the mountainside.

Rapid response: Chaffee County emergency agencies set up a command center at Chimney Rock road, off of CR 162 while they respond to the rock slide at Agnes Vaille Falls

Loose rocks: The area around the popular hiking trail had received heavy rains recently, which could have caused the devastating rock slide

Backed up: Police closed the road around the hiking trail, causing traffic to pile up in the rural part of Colorado

Large amounts of rain had previously fallen on Mount Princeton, which could have contributed to the boulders coming loose and sliding down the mountain. 

The trail is popular with day hikers because it offers just a short, rocky scramble to the spectacular Agnes Vaille Falls.

The trail is below Mount Princeton, a 14,197-foot peak. The National Forest Service describes the trail as short and relatively easy.

The trail is one of the first hikes recommended to people new to the area and is also popular with tourists, said Margaret Dean, a regular hiker who has hiked the trail with her 7-year-old grandson.
