An animal trainer has become the first person in the world to be awarded a Masters degree in how sea lion whiskers work. 

Alyx Milne from Liverpool has been fascinated by the mammals ever since she visited SeaWorld as a child. 

The 27-year-old, who works at Blackpool Zoo, loves them so much she decided to write a dissertation on the motor neuron abilities of their whiskers. 

Alyx Milne was awarded a distinction for her research into sea lion whiskers at Manchester Metropolitan University 

After extensive research, Miss Milne has been awarded a distinction in the subject from Manchester Metropolitan University.  

The first of its kind, her research will be published in the Comparative Physiology Journal.  

Sea lions use their hyper-sensitive whiskers to know where to look for fish by picking up vibrations in the water. 

Made up of tiny nerve fibres, they help the mammals navigate their way across the ocean and avoid preying creatures.

'From the moment I was splashed by a killer whale while visiting SeaWorld, Florida, I knew that I was going to be a ‘Shamu’ trainer one way or another,' said Miss Milne who is now pursuing a PhD in marine mammals. 

'Working with the sea lions at Blackpool Zoo has been a major part of my research.

'I’m so pleased I have something so great to show for it.'

Opened in 1972, Blackpool Zoo is home to more than 1,500 animals from all over the world and has the largest sea lion pool in Britain.
