Nicky Butt has returned to his role with Manchester United's Under 21 side following a spell assisting the first-team in the absence of manager Louis van Gaal.

Sportsmail understands Butt will be back alongside reserve team manager Warren Joyce for a friendly at Southport on Tuesday evening and it is believed that he will continue in this role for the coming season.

Good relationship: Manchester United coaches Joyce and Butt have enjoyed working together

He had been coaching the first team with assistant manager Ryan Giggs, and the new Dutch duo Marcel Bout and Albert Stuivenberg while Louis van Gaal was away with Holland at the World Cup.

Butt did not travel on the club's pre-season tour of the USA and as Sportsmail revealed in June, the intention has always been for him to return to the reserve side where he has forged a productive relationship with Joyce.

Paul Scholes and Phil Neville have also not joined United's inner circle of coaching staff in the USA and although Van Gaal last week insisted roles would be found for the duo at the club, a decision is yet to be reached.

On Tuesday evening, the pair were at Salford City's pre-season friendly against Stalybridge.  

Promise: Louis van Gaal has insisted he will find a role at the club for Butt, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes
