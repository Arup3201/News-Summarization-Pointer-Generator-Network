Penance: Eric Justin Toth, pictured, was captured in Nicaragua after a year on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitives

A Washington private school teacher captured in Nicaragua after a year on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitives list said he knew from age 13 that he was attracted to young boys and that his urges were 'dangerous' in a letter to the judge tasked with sentencing his child pornography case.

Eric Justin Toth told the judge he plans to spend the rest of his life 'doing penance' for his crimes and said he wants to spend his time in prison 'as productively as possible,' including participating in a program to train seeing eye dogs.

Toth fled Washington in 2008 after images
 of child pornography were found on a camera he had used while a teacher
 at Beauvoir, a private elementary school located on the grounds of the 
Washington National Cathedral.

The FBI added Toth to its Most Wanted list in 2012, where he filled a vacancy created by Osama bin Laden's death.

He was finally caught last year in Nicaragua after five years on the run.

In the two-page letter that was submitted to federal court Monday ahead of his March 11 sentencing, Toth acknowledged that he became aware of his attraction to boys when he was just 13.

'I knew society considered people like me monsters, so I swore myself to secrecy,' he wrote.

He went on to apologize for his actions and said he has always known his urges were 'dangerous.'

'For
 years, my brain manufactured one justification after another for giving
 into my sexual urges. In more recent years, I've worked hard to change 
that and continue to work on it in prison. In my heart of hearts, I've 
always known my urges are dangerous,' he wrote.

Toth's lawyers are recommending that he spend 22 years in prison. That's the low end of a recommended sentencing range agreed to by Toth as part of a guilty plea last year.

Toth's lawyers said he has no criminal
 record, a history of psychological problems including depression and 
that when he was in high school he was sexually abused by a teacher.

Prosecutors
 asked that Toth be sentenced to 30 years in prison. Both groups of 
lawyers agreed that after prison he should spend a lifetime on 
supervised release.

Toth's lawyers wrote that he would like to serve his sentence at a New Jersey prison that has a program to train the guide dogs.

Toth ended his letter by saying he 
will 'commit the rest of my life to doing penance, to kindness and 
decency, and to honest and perpetual accountability.'

Toth
 pleaded guilty in December to three counts of producing child 
pornography, identity theft and misuse of a Social Security number. He 
acknowledged that in 2005, while working as a counselor at a Wisconsin, 
he took photographs and videos of a sleeping male camper.

In 2006, after he began working as a third-grade teacher at Beauvoir, he took pictures and videos of one student.

He also installed a hidden video camera disguised as an air freshener in a school bathroom. The camera captured 15 children using the bathroom.

Toth was escorted off Beauvoir's campus in June 2008 after school administrators found images of child pornography on a school camera he used.

A media card containing more images was found at the school soon after, but Toth fled before police could arrest him. He spent time in Texas and Arizona before authorities caught him in Nicaragua.
