Australian tennis star Lleyton Hewitt is on the verge of calling it quits on an illustrious career after admitting he is just one injury away from retirement.

The Aussie ace, who at 33 has spent almost half his life playing at the professional level, made the revelation that his career might soon be coming to a close after going down in a five-set thriller to  15th seed Jerzy Janowicz. The second-round loss to his Polish opponent was the 42nd five set match Hewitt has played - the most of any player in the modern tennis era.

The two-time grand slam champion said he felt incredibly frustrated following the defeat given his relatively good bill of health, and admitted post-match that it may be the last time tennis fans get to see the Australian at Wimbledon.

Lleyton Hewitt said he is just one injury away from retirement after his grueling five-set loss to Polish player Jerzy Janowicz.

'I don't know if I'll be back, you never know,' he Hewitt, after his 7-5 6-4 6-7 4-6 6-3 second round loss to the 15th seed.

'I'm one injury away from hanging up the racket at any time. 'The body felt fine out there, which is obviously a positive thing.'

Hewitt said the loss was a hard pill to swallow, and had he the opportunity over believes he would have improved on his second round struggle.

'But, you know, still frustrating to walk off the court feeling fine, feeling like you could have bounced back and played another five-setter tomorrow.'

'But you don't get that opportunity. With all that I've been through, the surgeries, it's going okay at the minute.'

The 2002 Wimbledon champion registered his 42nd five-set clash in major tournament action, to move past Andre Agassi's record.

Known for his gutsy on-court determination, Hewitt said he felt guilty for inflicting so many five-set marathons on his opponents, supporters and family over the years. He also said, despite years of  injury setbacks, he has never once lost an ounce of enthusiasm for the sport.

Radical foot surgery in 2012 saved Hewitt from premature retirement, while regular hip trouble has plagued the former world No 1 who still holds the record for the youngest player ever, at 20, to rise to the top ranking.

Hewitt admitted that should he retire at the end of the current campaign, he will do so proud of his ability to fight back from a number of career-threatening problems.

'I'd much 
rather win in three or four sets than go the distance all the time, I 
seem to put everyone through the wringer quite a bit,' he said.

'I still enjoy it, I still enjoy doing the hard work: for moments out there like today, to play five-setters against the best guys in the world.

'When I've had the surgeries, I've missed it as well when I've been out.

'The last couple of years I've been grateful I've been able to come back, especially after the last surgery where I didn't really think I'd be able to go out there and compete against the guys again.

'There's satisfaction in doing that.'

Hewitt's most notable career achievements include winning the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon men's singles titles, as well as the the 2000 US Open men's doubles title.
