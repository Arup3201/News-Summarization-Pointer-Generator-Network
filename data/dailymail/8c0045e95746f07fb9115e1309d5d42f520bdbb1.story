Margaret Thatcher inspired love and loathing, but even her greatest detractors could never dispute her work ethic – the Iron Lady survived on four hours’ sleep at night and was known to see holidays as something that got in the way of toil.

As a result, little light has been shed on how she spent her time away from the coalface at No 10 and the House of Commons.

But Dr David Barnardo and his wife Ann, owners of Church Cottage in Great Witcombe, Gloucestershire, can offer some insight into how she liked to spend her rare weekends away from the pressures of office, because the Thatchers were regular visitors to Church Cottage in the Eighties.

Retired gastroenterologist David, 75, a great-great-nephew of Dr Thomas Barnardo, founder of the children’s charity, and Ann, 73, a retired bereavement counsellor, were prospective buyers of Church Cottage in 1998 when they noticed photographs on the walls of Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis relaxing in the garden of this grand country abode.

It transpires that the Thatchers had been weekend guests of the man who sold Church Cottage to the Barnardos, Sir Christopher Lawson, who lived there with his wife Marjorie.

Sir Christopher enjoyed a high-flying career with the Mars confectionary group before working with the Conservative Party in the Eighties as a marketing adviser. Along with Cecil Parkinson and Norman Tebbit, he masterminded the Tory Election victories of 1983 and 1987.

He was among the Iron Lady’s most trusted confidants – she described him in her memoirs as ‘that rare and useful animal, a businessman with acute political instincts’.

But the Thatchers’ invitations to Church Cottage may well have come through Denis, as he and Sir Christopher were golfing partners. Sir Christopher died in 2007, aged 84.

One can see why the Thatchers enjoyed coming here. It is difficult to imagine a setting more removed from the hurly burly of Westminster.

Situated at the foot of one of the most spectacular wooded escarpments in the Cotswolds, and in striking distance of Cheltenham and Cirencester, Church Cottage stands in nearly one-and-a-half acres of landscaped grounds in the peaceful hamlet of Great Witcombe in the shadow of the village church – hence the house name.

The Barnardos are now selling the property for £1.5 million to return to Surrey, where they lived before moving to the Cotswolds and where their children and grandchildren continue to live.

Church Cottage, which has five bedrooms 
and an attic room devoted to a model railway, originated from a group of
three farm labourers’ dwellings, the first being built in the late 
1600s.

These were remodelled as one house in the 19th Century, which explains why the property has three staircases.

The house has been evolving ever since. An extension was added at the back in Edwardian times, and with one owner buying a section of the road running into Great Witcombe, turning it into the property’s rather grand private drive.

‘We feel we have the best of both worlds,’ says David.

‘There’s the cosiness you get with the low ceilings and old beams of the 17th Century rooms in the front and the larger Edwardian dimensions at the back.’

The Barnardos have also played their role in Church Cottage’s evolution, adding a large conservatory and indulging their love of gardening to transform its outside space into a magnificent plot with a French-style ‘potager’ vegetable and fruit garden.

They have also restored a water feature at the front.

Despite Church Cottage’s location deep in the Cotswolds countryside, David was attracted to the property because of its convenience for London, Birmingham and Bristol, which he would visit when he was chairman of the trustees of Barnardos from 2001 to 2006.

He remains a vice-president and now serves in an ambassadorial role.

He is the first family member since his great-grandfather’s brother – Dr Thomas, who lived from 1845 to 1905 – to play a major role in the running of the charity. ‘When Dr Thomas Barnardo died, the family were kept at a distance from the running of the charity but I always felt a connection with the founder because I, like him, trained at The London Hospital in East London,’ he says.

David and Ann are part of the last surviving branch of the family bearing the Barnardo name and are proud that three of their five children are trained doctors, ensuring there will be more Dr Barnardos in years to come.

Guy Tabony, manager of Hamptons International in Painswick, which is handling the sale, says: ‘Church Cottage is ideal for growing families or for those with teenagers requiring their own space. It is also well suited for young retirees and for those looking to escape the city.’
