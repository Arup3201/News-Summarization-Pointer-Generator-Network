Raul has been unveiled as a New York Cosmos player at a press conference on Tuesday. 

The Real Madrid legend, who scored 323 goals in 741 matches for Real Madrid, will make his bow in the North American Soccer league at the start of the 2015 season.

The 37-year-old Spaniard has signed a multi-year contract, and will also serve as a technical director for the club's new academy, which is due to open next year.

The Cosmos play in the league below Major League Soccer, and Raul admitted upon signing that he was excited about the prospect of playing for the club and develop their academy.

'Everyone throughout the soccer world knows the Cosmos name and the legacy of the players that played for the team previously,' he told the club's website. 

Born: June 27 1977 (age 37)

1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls)

2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28)

2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11) 

1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) 

'They helped establish soccer in America and I'm honoured to follow in their footsteps. I believe in this club's vision and I'm excited to be a part of that.'

'I have a contract for two years. I will try to play those two years, but it might be one, maybe two, maybe even three years, Raul added.

'If the body says this is it in six months, I will be more involved in the academy. I moved here with something in mind – bringing my family to enjoy New York, which is one of the best cities in the world, and I’m committed to that. There are no limits and no deadlines. I will hopefully play for many, many, many years.' 

The Cosmos made their name in the original version of the North American Soccer League when the likes of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto signed up to play in the fledgling league.

Pele now serves as the honorary president of the current Cosmos, a club reborn in 2010 with the intention of securing a place in Major League Soccer.

However, in one of the most recent rounds of MLS expansion they were trumped by the newly formed New York City FC - a team backed by Manchester City and the New York Yankees that is due to begin play next year with another Spanish striker, David Villa, spearheading their attack.

Raul won six league titles, three European Cups and scored the most Champions League goals for Real Madrid

Brazil legend Pele played out the twilight of his career at the Cosmos. Following 18 sublime years at Santos, Pele headed to New York for two seasons, winning the 1977 NASL title. His number 10 jersey has since been retired by the club.

FRANZ BECKENBAUER 1977-80 and 1983 (132, 21)

Beckenbauer headed to New York Cosmos after a glittering career at Bayern Munich and West Germany. Having accumulated four Bundesliga titles and three European Cups, alongside winning the 1974 World Cup, Beckenbauer enjoyed two successful spells in the NASL with the Cosmos before retiring in 1983.

GIORGIO CHINAGLIA 1976-83 (213, 193)

The Italian forward actually started his career in Swansea before making his name in Serie A. His goal scoring exploits guided Lazio to the Serie title in 1974 before Chinaglia headed to New York. The striker scored for fun with the Cosmos and fired them to four NASL titles, prompting his number nine shirt to be retired when he left the club in 1983.

But that has not dented the ambitions of the Cosmos owners, as the addition of Raul is intended to demonstrate.

'We're obviously thrilled to add a player of his quality to the team,' head coach Giovanni Savarese said. 'Raul's skill and ability is world renowned. He's a world-class player and he adds a whole new dimension to our attack.

'He also brings immense passion and knowledge that he can share with our team and with the next generation of Cosmos players in our youth academy. He'll help set the academy training curriculum, structure and establish our player development pyramid.

'His involvement from the beginning is that he will be helping the director, which we are going to add to our staff. The director will be full time, but Raul will be advising this director about building the curriculum, building the structure, and building the entire academy for us. We want to make sure that it is uniform, from the top to the bottom.' 

Raul's deal with the Cosmos allows for him to take over the running of the club's academy after his retirement from playing.

Raul spent 16 years with Real Madrid, winning six La Liga titles, four Spanish Super Cups, and three Champions League crowns before moving on to Schalke and most recently Al-Sadd Sports Club. He remains the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 71 goals.

The long term likes with Madrid meant that even not even Raul could refuse an opportunity to return to Real should an opportunity arise.

'My plan is to build an academy, and work on this project with the Cosmos,' Raul said. 'It won’t take six months for this kind of big project, but I’m committed to being here with the Cosmos now. If I return to Spain at any given time, for obvious reasons it would probably be with Real Madrid.

'Whatever I’m doing here now with the Cosmos would be a great experience to go and apply with Real Madrid, or anywhere else. This is a great project that I’m embracing very much.'

Cosmos chief operating officer Erik Stover said: 'Raul's long list of accolades speaks for itself. He's recognized worldwide as one of the greatest players of his generation and we are now thrilled to welcome him to New York.'

The 37-year-old has had a trophy laden career, including three Champions League titles with Real Madrid
