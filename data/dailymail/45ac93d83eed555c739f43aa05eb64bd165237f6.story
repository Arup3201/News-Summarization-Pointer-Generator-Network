A video surfaced this week showing Donald Sterling's notorious former girlfriend, V. Stiviano, making racially charged remarks about people of color.  

The 2011 video, which has been obtained by TMZ Sports, was allegedly made by Stiviano for a reality show pilot about gold diggers.

'I don't understand black people.' the mixed-race Stiviano says into the camera. 'The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don't known what to do with it.'

Car talk: Stiviano went on a tangent, claiming that black people waste their money on silly things like expensive car rims

Ironic: Stiviano gained notoriety last month after she secretly recorded LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling (right) lambasting her for posing for pictures with black people

Sterling's former mistress has both African-American and Mexican roots.

The 31-year-old model sparked a firestorm last month when she secretly recorded Los Angeles Clippers owner Sterling chastising her for posing for pictures with NBA legend Magic Johnson, who is black.

In the newly released video of Stiviano, the model mocks African-Americans for their supposed tendency to waste their money on trivial things.

'They're like, “Yo, I wanna put extra rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around. I'm gonna call them spinners,"' she says.  

She continues her rant, adding: 'They do stupid s*** like that, when there's people starving around the world. That's what people want to do with their money?’

Another 
snippet from the video shows Stiviano in a passenger seat of a car 
calling herself a 'hood rat' and saying that she is looking for someone 
to pick her up.

 disturbing third clip starring Stiviano made for the failed TV show 
depicts the model talking to an Elmo puppet, which she then uses to 
simulate oral sex on a female friend sitting in the driver’s seat.

One to talk: Stiviano, 31, is half Mexican-American and half African-American

Failed TV star: Stiviano, 31, pictured May 21 in Beverly Hills, was supposed to star in a reality show about gold diggers three years ago

'We don't like black people,' she tells the plush red doll in her hands.

As a result of the scandal sparked by V. Stiviano’s audio recording of her billionaire boyfriend, Sterling has been banned for life from the NBA and ordered to pay a $2.5million fine.

The 80-year-old married father of three was diagnosed this week with Alzheimer’s, allowing his wife to sell the Clippers to a former Microsoft executive for $2billion. The deal has yet to be finalized as it requires Sterling’s approval.
