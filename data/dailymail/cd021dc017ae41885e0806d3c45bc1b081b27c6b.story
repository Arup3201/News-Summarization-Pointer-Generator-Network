Set a target of 185 to win, Australia were all out for 123 with Kate Cross and Anya Shrubsole each taking three wickets for England at the WACA.

England captain Charlotte Edwards had earlier passed the half-century mark to score 56 before becoming one of five victims for Australian bowler Ellyse Perry, while Jenny Gunn made 44.

 England need only win two of the six games to retain the trophy while 
Australia need victories in five.

 MCG in Melbourne on Sunday and Australia captain Jodie Fields is 
looking for an improved display from her team.

'It was a great Test match to be a part of, but unfortunately we didn't come out on top,' she said.

'We've got a great team and I didn't think we played to 100 per cent of our ability but hopefully we can bounce back.'

All-rounder
 Perry, who dismissed Edwards, Lydia Greenway, Arran Brindle, Natalie 
Sciver and Cross, added: 'I think everyone's really disappointed to lose
 such a tough Test match like that.

'The match turned and twisted, and those six points will go a long way in the Ashes but now we've got the limited-overs games.

'I think we've learned a lot from this game, but it would have been lovely to have won.'
