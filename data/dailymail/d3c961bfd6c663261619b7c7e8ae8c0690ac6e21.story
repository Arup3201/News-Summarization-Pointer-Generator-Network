A Muslim teenager who was banned from taking A-levels at a leading comprehensive because she started to wear a niqab has moved schools.

The unnamed 16-year-old said she was too ‘upset, hurt and angry’ to go back to Camden School for Girls after it refused to allow her to wear the full Islamic veil which only reveals her eyes.

The girl reportedly left the north London state school in tears after being told she could not wear the niqab and then decided to move to one that allows it.

Last night, an online petition had gathered more than 1,000 signatures demanding that ‘Islamophobia’ at the school stop and that she be allowed to wear the veil. 

The school is rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and alumnae include Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah, actress Emma Thompson and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.

It has no uniform and is famous for a liberal approach to education, but it said the niqab contravened its ‘appearance policy’.

The girl, who has attended Camden Girls for the past five years and took her GCSEs there, yesterday said the niqab was not ‘un-British’.

‘I was born in Britain. I know perfect English, I enjoy doing the normal, typical things like drinking tea and eating biscuits,’ she told the Evening Standard. 

‘Britain claims to be multicultural, meaning they accept different kinds of people.’

She added: ‘I feel if people knew how friendly and social we are, they wouldn’t say it’s un-British.’

The girl said the school told her that dress ‘which does not allow teacher-student interactions’ was against its rules.

‘The school has no uniform and I thought they were accepting and open-minded,’ she said. 

‘To be honest a lot of people at the school wear inappropriate clothing … very provocative and revealing clothing like extremely short shorts – so it didn’t make sense that they were refusing me to wear the niqab.’

She will now study for her A-levels at a different sixth-form college, even though it takes her up to an hour to get there every day.

In support of the girl, an anonymous protester started a petition on change.org, which says: ‘[Camden School for Girls] is renowned for its individuality and strong feminist views. 

Camden School for Girls (pictured) claimed its 'appearance policy' was ‘educational’ and said in a statement: 'Inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow  interactions will be challenged'

'However, this poorly thought out decision made by the school contradicts this. What happened to freedom of expression?’

The girl’s sister told the BBC the school’s ruling had been ‘very upsetting’, adding: ‘My sister just wants to wear the niqab for her own reasons … I don’t feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her.’

Farhana Khanom, a former pupil, said ‘discriminating’ against those who want to wear the veil was ‘utterly disgusting’.

Yesterday, Camden School for Girls claimed the policy was ‘educational’, saying: ‘Interactions between students and teachers take place in a number of ways, but one of the most important is through reading facial expression.’

In a statement, it added: ‘Inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow teacher-student interactions will be challenged.’

The school is thought to be the first to have imposed a bar on the niqab since Birmingham Metropolitan College was forced to overturn a ban last September, following a petition signed by 9,000 people.

Under Department for Education guidance issued in 2007 schools can set their own uniform policies and enforce such a ban on security, safety or learning grounds.

A landmark case at the High Court that year rejected a Buckinghamshire pupil’s claim that she should be allowed to wear the niqab in classes.
