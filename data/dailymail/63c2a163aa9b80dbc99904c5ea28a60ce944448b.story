In space, no-one can hear you scream. And that's the main problem former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has with Will Smith's latest sci-fi film After Earth.

A day after attending the New York première of the post-apocalyptic thriller, the second man to walk on the Moon said the film was a great family drama.

But, he complained, the space scenes were unrealistic. 'There was a lot of noise. In space, you don't get that much noise,' he said.

Aldrin, who followed Neil Armstrong onto the surface of the moon during the historic Apollo 11 landing in 1969, explained that 'noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum. We talked over headsets.'

'Fortunately, we were free of static. We could communicate with each other pretty clearly, and mission control, though we were 50,000 miles away,' he said.

The 83-year old former space man was the 
guest of honour at an event for a new luxury camera from Hasselblad.

The
 Swedish company has supplied cameras used in space missions for more 
than 50 years.

Aldrin said he enjoyed the father-son dynamic between Will Smith and son Jaden, but thought there was a little too much 'Shoot'em-up' for his taste.

'I hope the aliens are more peaceful than they are in this film, wherever they are,' Aldrin joked.

Father-son dynamic: The Smiths play a father and son team sent back to Earth a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes

Adventure: The pair crash land on the surface of the planet, losing their colleagues in the process, and it is up to Jaden to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help

Not well received: New York Post's Lou Lumenick said: 'Most of the film consists of Kitai (Jaden) traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal

In space no-one can hear you scream because sounds are carried in the form of compression waves, meaning that they must travel through a medium such as air.

When we hear a sound caused by a slamming door, for example, what happens is that the impact of the door on its frame compresses nearby air molecules and this compression propagates through the air until it reaches our ears.

In space, however, the environment is a virtual vacuum, with hardly any molecules for the sound to pass through. Those molecules that are around are extremely far apart.

So, if you were to slam a door in space, the impact would more than likely not affect any neighbouring molecules and, even if it did, those molecules would not be near to any others to form a wave.

That means the vibration of the slamming door would not travel to your ear and you would hear nothing.

Or, as Buzz Aldrin rather succinctly put it: 'Noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum'

However, Aldrin's enthusiasm for After Earth's dramatic quality has not been shared by film critics, who have lambasted the movie.

The Smiths play a father and son team sent back to Earth a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes.

Unfortunately they end up badly damaging their spaceship in an asteroid field, and as the rest of the Ranger Corps troops travelling alongside them die when they crash land, it is up to Jaden to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help.

In his one star review of the film, the New York Post's Lou Lumenick says: 'Most of the film consists of Kitai (Jaden) travelling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then, even less interestingly, trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal.'

And Variety's Scott Foundas had his knife out for the stars' acting, claiming: 'The senior Smith gives one of the least substantive performances of his career, while the undeniably charismatic Jaden toggles between two primary modes of expression: paralysing fear and simmering rage.'

The Washington Post's Michael O’Sullivan is even more scathing in his assessment of the teenager, arguing he 'spends much of the movie running around in a panic, waving his little arms at predators and shouting, “Leave me alone!”

'It’s appropriate to the character, I guess. But it’s also more than mildly annoying. Kitai comes across as a whiny, wilful and one-dimensional brat.'

Despite the critics' scathing assessments, and his own admission that he preferred the more realistic sci-fi work of Arthur C Clarke, Aldrin said he was impressed by the set design of earth 1,000 years into the future.

'The scenes of the cities were really remarkable,' Aldrin said.  

That differed significantly from his experience on the Moon.

'The place was just totally lifeless, and that prompted me to use the words, "magnificent desolation" in contrast to the magnificent experience that humanity could move itself ahead to get to the Moon,' Aldrin said.

'And as Neil says, that was sort of a small step for man, but to me the giant leap is establishing permanence on another planet.'

Aldrin wants it to be Mars, but feels it won't happen in his lifetime, unless he's 'really, really long-lived.'
