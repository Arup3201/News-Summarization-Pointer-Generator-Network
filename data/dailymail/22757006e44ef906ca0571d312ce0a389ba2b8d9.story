The opening weekend of the new Premier League season saw some terrific goals scored, but none quite matched that of Arminia Bielefeld striker Fabian Klos.

The 26-year-old  hit the back of the net with arguably the most eye-catching strike in all of European football on Sunday when he connected with a volley against Sandhausen.

Klos' effort, which came when he sweetly caught a floated corner with his right foot in the 57th minute, putting his side 2-0 up in the first round of the German Cup.

Unstoppable: Klos' effort rockets into the top corner to put the home side 2-0 up in the German Cup first round

Bielefeld, who play in the second division in Germany, went on to win the game 4-1, but their victory will be remembered for Klos' stunning strike.

Although it was with his right foot and not his left, Klos' goal evoked memories of Zinedine Zidane's brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen.

The Frenchman's effort turned out to be the winner for Real Madrid, who beat the German side 2-1 at Hampden Park in Glasgow.
