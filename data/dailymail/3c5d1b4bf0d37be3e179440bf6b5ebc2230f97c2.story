Noah Ritter may be just five years old, but it would seem he already has celebrity potential.

A live television interview with the Pottstown, Pennsylvania, youngster has become a YouTube hit, garnering over 82,000 views.

Noah was stopped by a WNEP TV crew on Friday, the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in nearby Honesdale. 

But while reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda.

Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never 
been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news 
because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the 
remote I have to watch the Powerball.'

The red-haired preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice.

Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life.

'Well, it was great because apparently 
you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s 
all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been 
on live television. I've never been on live television.'

The amused reporter, who is just seen crouching down to speak at his level asks: 'Are you excited?'

To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

'I'm a celebrity!': Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, says the youngster is enjoying his newfound fame

Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'

He added that the youngster appears to be enjoying his newfound fame.

'We were watching it on the computer and
 it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, "That’s 
me. I’m a celebrity."'

But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski says his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming.

'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' he said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'
