The White House and the Health & Human Services Department boasted Wednesday that 3.3 million Americans have signed up for private insurance coverage through marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act.

But the administration still hasn't said a word about how many – or how few – of those signing up on the chronically ill healthcare.gov website have paid for their insurance, and are actually covered.

A MailOnline analysis of publicly available totals from five states that run their own health insurance exchanges found that on average, just 66.5 per cent of enrollees in those states have paid premiums.

If that proportion holds nationwide, the total number of Americans who are actually covered by private insurance because of Obamacare is less than 2.2 million.

At least five states provide such statistics on their own enrollees, showing that the numbers are, or ought to be, generally obtainable.

A quarterly report published Wednesday by HHS announced that 'to date, 3.3 million persons have selected a Marketplace plan during the first four months of the initial open enrollment period, including 1.4 million in SBMs [state-based marketplaces] and 1.9 million in the FFM [federally facilitated marketplace].'

But HHS conceded that its numbers 'include those who have paid a premium and those who have not yet paid a premium, regardless of when their coverage begins.'

'Enrollment is measured as those who selected a plan,' an HHS press release confirms.

Similar disclaimers are offered some 20 times in the HHS report, both in its text and in accompanying graphs.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Aaron Albright told MailOnline that his agency hasn't 'prioritized' reporting payment statistics, but plans to 'once our automated
payment systems are completed and fully tested.'

At least five states, though, have already figured out how to do it.

Press releases from health insurance exchanges in the states MailOnline sampled, including populous New York and California, show that 966,312 Americans have selected Obamacare plans there.

Of those, 642,979 have paid for at least one month of insurance coverage.

The state-by-state number are all over the map. Eighty-five per cent of Rhode Island's enrollees have paid first-month's premiums. That percentage was about 75 in California, 66 in Nevada, 59 in New York and a dismal 51.5 per cent in the state of Washington.

The Obama administration said 25 per cent of the national enrollment total are Americans between the ages of 18 and 34, a far cry from the roughly 40 per cent economics say must enroll in order to avoid a 'death spiral' for Obamacare.

The program's economics depend heavily on the presumption that a flood of younger, healthier people will contribute premium dollars in order to offset the cost of medical care for the old and sick.

But with minimal fines – starting at just $95 this year – and widespread recognition that the IRS can only collect the penalty from Americans who are due an income tax refund, many young people are opting out.

And early technical glitches and wholesale disasters plagued healthcare.gov as well as some of the state-based exchanges. Oregon's, for instance, is still not functional after a nearly five-month delay.

Consumers have until Feb. 15 to select a plan if they want to be covered by March 1.

But HHS quietly announced this week that on Saturday, the deadline day, a Social Security Administration computer system used to screen applicants for eligibility will be offline for long-planned annual maintenance.
