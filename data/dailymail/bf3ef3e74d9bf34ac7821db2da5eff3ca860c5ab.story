Unlike most men going through a break-up, Dean Kremer did not go out and get drunk with his mates. Instead he started collecting replica Star Wars lightsabers.

Now the Darwin man is selling them off and the money will go towards buy a home with his new girlfriend.

Mr Kremer, 33, is letting go of one Yoda lightsaber, one Darth Maul, two Darth Vaders, two Anakin Skywalkers, one Mace Windu, one Obi-Wan Kenobi and two Luke Skywalkers.

Dean Kremer (pictured with a Luke Skywalker lightsaber), 33, is looking to sell off his collection of 10 Master Replica lightsabers

The lightsaber was made famous by the Star Wars saga, which starred Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker (above)

 The Darwin man started collecting the lightsabers after he broke up with his ex-girlfriend

After being with his girlfriend Maria for three years, Mr Kremer decided it was time to sell off the Master Replica lightsabers, which are no longer manufactured.

'[They] reminded me of the break-up with the ex-girlfriend. I started collecting after the break-up,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The new girlfriend is very indifferent about it and we're going to use the funds for something better.

'Hopefully towards a house and something more constructive.'

The collection includes a Darth Vader one (left) and the purchase comes with a custom cabinet with fluorescent down lights

He is selling all of them - including one Yoda lightsaber, one Darth Maul, two Darth Vaders (one is pictured above), two Anakin Skywalkers, one Mace Windu, one Obi-Wan Kenobi and two Luke Skywalkers - for $3,000

The collection consists of one of these Luke Skywalker lightsabers and started collecting them because he was not much of a drinker

Mr Kremer said he started collecting the lightsabers five years ago because he was not much of a drinker.

'I'm just applying paperback psychology to this. I wanted to remind myself of good childhood memories. It was like a post break-up depression, I guess,' he said.

'I’m not much of a partier or a drinker. It wasn't really my style, especially in response to a break up.'

He said he bought them to remind him of better times and hanging out with his cousins during his childhood

Mr Kremer said the lightsabers reminded him of the time he spent hanging out with his cousins.

'My cousins were a lot more well off and when we visited their homes, they would have all these Star Wars toys,' he said.

'[I would play] with my cousins in their home and play with the older kids toys.

'We can also relate to that because the older kids always had better toys than the younger kids.'

To get your hands on the collection, Mr Kremer is advertising the lightsabers for $3,000 on Gumtree.

It comes with a custom cabinet with sliding glass doors and fluorescent down lights to store them in.

'For the price of the collection, they [the new owner] would have to be a pretty big fan, so I'm sure it'll go to a good home,' he said.
