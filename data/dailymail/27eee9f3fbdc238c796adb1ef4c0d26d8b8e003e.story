Wales will have to wait to lay their hands on the RBS Six Nations trophy, if they claim the title on Saturday - as the silverware will be elsewhere.

Organisers of the championship have been presented with a difficult logistical problem, by the unusual fact that three teams are in the hunt to finish top of the pile, going into the final weekend. 

There are two of the new tournament trophies, and they will be stationed at Murrayfield and Twickenham.

England lead the table on points difference and Ireland are close behind them, with third-placed Wales requiring an emphatic victory over Italy at Rome's Stadio Olimpico to snatch the title. 

On that basis, a decision has been made to place the trophies in Edinburgh and London.

In the event of an English triumph, captain Chris Robshaw will raise a trophy at HQ, in front of the home crowd. 

If the Irish retain their title, Paul O'Connell and Co will be presented with a trophy in the Scottish capital, although it is likely to be a low-key ceremony at a post-match function.

However, if Wales surge past their rivals to seize the prize, they will travel home to Cardiff and arrangements will be made for a trophy presentation on either Sunday or Monday. 

That raises the possibility of a public ceremony, which could be expected to draw a sizeable attendance, depending on the exact location.
