Chelsea defender Filipe Luis took to Twitter and Instagram  to celebrate the birth of his daughter Sara, who was born on Monday.

The Brazilian was an unused substitute in the Blues' 1-1 draw with Manchester City, and a day after his side dropped two points late on at the Etihad Stadium, the 29-year-old was enjoying much better news.

He tweeted his delight in his native tongue Portuguese, and wrote: 'The greatest gift of God. Welcome Sara', alongside a picture of himself and wife Patricia Kasmirski.

The Brazilian has not started a Premier League match for the Blues but played in the Champions League clash against Schalke

The Brazilian, who joined Chelsea for £16million from Atletico Madrid this summer, has made a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge, playing just eight Premier League minutes in the Blues' first five games.

He did however start last week's Champions League clash against Schalke and looked solid in the 1-1 draw. 

He'll be hoping now to push on and overtake Cesar Azpilicueta as the club's first-choice left back.  

The 29-year-old is known for his relentless energy, and helped Atletico win the La Liga title last year
