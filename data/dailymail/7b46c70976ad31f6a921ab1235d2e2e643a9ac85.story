Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson has hit out at the jailing of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce over their speeding points conspiracy.

Millions commit the same crime and Pryce’s sentence for ‘an act  of kindness’ was harsh compared with the sentencing of violent sex offenders, writes Clarkson in the latest Top Gear magazine.

Both Huhne, 59, and Pryce, 61, were jailed for perverting the course of justice after Pryce took his speeding points in 2003. She came clean in 2010 after Huhne left her for his bisexual aide.

Referring to Pryce’s punishment, Clarkson said: ‘Eight months for what at the time was an act of love and kindness .  .  . Stuart Hall was given 30 months for sexually assaulting 13 young girls.’

Clarkson cites a survey stating 12 per cent of people on the road are guilty of the same crime as Huhne.

‘Robbers, rapists and people who knock old ladies over on purpose are given a spot of light gardening as a punishment, but when the crime is to do with motoring the system throws the biggest book at its disposal at your head,’ he says.

Clarkson faced a motoring ban in France last year after driving at more than 30mph over the speed limit while filming with co-star Richard Hammond in Toulouse.
