After shivering through the longest winter in 50 years, Britain will experience the warmest day of the year this weekend.

And for some lucky parts of the country, it might even be a good time to give the barbecue its first outing of the year.

Temperatures could reach 21C (70F) tomorrow as the weather system which has led to bitter conditions over the last month finally clears.

Spring finally arriving: At Footscray Meadows in Sidcup Kent there were no blossoms on the trees, but there were daffodils on the ground

Central and eastern England will  experience the most sunshine, with temperatures highest in East Anglia and London.

The jet stream, the warm air current 
which governs most weather in the northern hemisphere, has been diverted
south, missing the UK, making March among the chilliest recorded.

But it will finally meander north over
the weekend, leading to warmer air across Britain and an end to the 
wintry conditions that have recently blighted the country.     
Temperatures in London could reach 21C (70F), beating the year’s 
previous high of 17.5C (64F) recorded in Trawscoed, Wales, on March 5.

Despite warmer temperatures continuing next week, other parts   will still experience rain, cloud cover and wind tomorrow.

The maximum temperature expected in Newcastle will be 16C (61F), while Cardiff will only see the mercury rise to 14C (57F).

Turning around: On Saturday rain will start to move across the southern half of the country, although it will start off dry in most places

Higher: On Sunday rain is also predicated and will spread across the UK as the day progresses, although temperatures are set to reach the high teens in some areas

Supermarkets are nonetheless predicting that the emerging sun will lead to a surge in sales of barbecue and picnic products.

Asda is stocking its shelves with sausages, burgers and ribs, expecting demand for meat products to jump by 60 per cent.

The supermarket also expects  a surge in sales of ice cream, wine and salads.

Asda spokesman Chris Carden said: ‘We 
have waited a long time for some sunshine so it is no surprise shoppers 
are looking to make the most of the hottest weekend of the year so far.’

Tesco has also increased supplies of 
barbecue and salad items to some regions, with the supermarket expecting
to sell 600 tons of cherry tomatoes and to see a 60 per cent rise in 
strawberry sales.

Mixed bag: Britain prepares for gales and heavy rain accompanied by warm temperatures this weekend

Bitter: March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C

Andy Ratcliffe, from forecaster Meteogroup, sought to dampen expectations for the weekend despite the temperature surge.

He said: ‘It will be mostly fine and 
warm in central and eastern England on Sunday, with highs of 20C (68F) 
to 21C (70F) in London, but everywhere else can expect rain, with some 
heavy pulses which will ease throughout the day.’

He said that temperatures will remain high next week but will fail to match those of tomorrow.

The Met Office’s Dan Williams said the weekend’s highest temperatures are a 50 per cent increase on seasonal averages.

But he also warned that conditions 
will be far from ideal in some places, adding: ‘It will also be breezy 
and cloudy, with some light, sporadic showers.’

Temperatures in March were an average 
of just 2.5C (36.5f) between March 1 and 26, according to the Met 
Office. This would make it the coldest March since 1962.
