Grim: Stephane Hirson disappeared in 1993. His bones in the ocean near the south of France

A hunt for a serial killer is underway after the skeletal remains of four people including a skull with ‘Death to paedophiles’ written across it were found off the French coast.

The bones were found by a diver in February in the shallow waters off the Cotes d'Azur and have been identified as belonging to two women and two men.

French detectives have opened a murder investigation and are now investigating how the victims died and whether they were kidnapped. 

Georges Gutierrez, the prosecutor in 
Grasse, said the probe would 'try to discover to whom these bones 
belonged and if these people were deliberately killed,' reported The Telegraph.

DNA
 tests showed that a humerus fished out of the sea belonged to Stéphane 
Hirson, a 17-year-old from Seine-et-Marne, near Paris, who disappeared 
20 years ago on his way to the job centre after ending a short stay in a
 psychiatric hospital.

Mr Hirson's relatives have spent the past two decades searching for him.

'How did Stephane find himself a 
thousand kilometres away from his home in a place where he knew no one?'
 said Valerie Cormier, his cousin reported The Australian.

'Was he killed? What does the skull with the words on it mean? And, especially, if someone knows something, why haven't they ever said anything?'

Detectives said there had never been any suggestion that Mr Hirson was involved in pedophilia, either as a victim or as a perpetrator.

Scientists have struggled to obtain genetic material from the bones, but the skull, thought to belong to a 50-year old man, was the first remain to be found and the words ‘Death to paedophiles’  had been written in permanent marker across it, still clearly visible despite the skull's lengthy underwater.

Expert divers combed the area and brought up another three bones – including the humerus of Hirson.

A jawbone was found stuck between rocks during a second dive.

'Why was just one bone per individual and not more parts of the skeleton?,' asked Mr Gutierrez.

'This is just one of thousands of questions,' he said as he announced the opening of the inquiry into cases of murder, kidnapping, imprisoning and taking and receiving corpses.
