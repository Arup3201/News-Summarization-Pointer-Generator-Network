The Department of Defense announced Thursday a program that will allow undocumented immigrants to enter the U.S. military.

The new rule applies only to those who qualify for the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, which gives immigrants who came to the country with their parents at least by 16 a path to citizenship.

The Pentagon's program will be capped at 1,500 recruits per year, reports the Military Times.

Path to citizenship: The Department of Defense announced Thursday a program that will allow undocumented immigrants to enter the U.S. military

The announcement is an expansion on an existing program that already allows foreign nationals with exceptional skills like rare foreign languages to serve.

Dubbed Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI), the program is targeted at 'immigrants with language skills critical to national security, such as Arabic, Chinese, Pashto or Persian' according to the Military Times.

One insider revealed that, within the 1.2 million and 2.1 million people eligible for DAVA, it's unclear how many would have the in demand language skills to make the cut.

'These are kids who entered the country at a fairly young age and have basically grown up in the United States, so the limit of their language talents would probably be the language that they received at home,' the insider told the Military Times.

The most common language at home for these immigrants is, of course, Spanish and not a Pashto or Persian and the like.

DACA was hailed by immigration advocates as a good interim fix to a larger problem of what to do with the more than 11 million immigrants thought to be living in the country illegally. Since the program's launch, those advocates have pushed Obama to do more for a larger group of immigrants.

DACA is open to immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16 years old, were younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and had been in the country since at least June 15, 2007, and have no criminal history. They also must be in school, have graduated from high school or earned a GED certificate or served in the military.

Republican lawmakers have derided the program as 'backdoor amnesty.'
