Three times as many young people are needing hospital treatment for Chron's disease today than a decade ago, medics say. TOWIE star Sam Faiers is a well-documented sufferer

Junk food and antibiotics are being blamed by doctors for the rise in the number of young people developing a serious digestive disorder.

The latest figures show three times as many young people need hospital treatment for Crohn’s disease today than  a decade ago.

Dr Sally Mitton, a consultant gastroenterologist at St George’s Hospital in London, said there has also been a big rise in the number diagnosed with the condition – and  diet is partly responsible.

‘If you have a lot of junk food it actually makes it more likely that you will develop Crohn’s disease,’ she said.

‘And people have noticed those who have lots of antibiotics – particularly in younger life – also seem to be more likely to develop this condition.’

Crohn’s, which is caused by inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, triggers frequent bouts of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and bleeding.

Along with colitis, it is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may be diagnosed at any age. However it tends to strike early in life and there is no cure.

It is not clear how eating junk food, typically high in animal fat or saturated fats, can lead to the disease, but doctors believe it pushes up the chances of genetically susceptible people developing it.

‘All the centres that get lots of referrals have noticed an increase over the last few decades,’ Dr Mitton said, adding that there are many genes which can predispose someone to the condition.

‘We try to keep patients fit enough to stay at home, but because of the increased number being diagnosed, the actual number needing to be admitted has gone up,’ she said.

New data – obtained by the BBC from the Health and Social Care Information Centre – show in 2003/4 there were 4,937 young adults aged between 16 and 29 admitted to hospitals in England for the condition. This rose to 19,405 in 2012/13.

Three-quarters of those with Crohn’s, which affects around 250,000 Britons, will need bowel reconstructive surgery at some point in their lives.

However, a spokesman for the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK said that while the prevalence of IBD has been increasing in recent years, there are many contributory causes – including genetic predisposition which can be triggered by environmental factors.

He added: ‘Dietary issues certainly can play a role, but there is no evidence they are the main cause. The gut bacteria can be radically altered in people with Crohn’s and colitis – with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer  beneficial bacteria which may also be significant.’

He said that the charity had been contacted by many patients who say they have always maintained a healthy diet, and who would disagree with the idea that junk food is behind the rise in cases.
