Cameroon midfielder Alex Song has been handed a three-match World Cup ban following his sending off against Croatia last Wednesday.

The Barcelona player was shown a straight red card in the 4-0 Group A loss for striking Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic in the back with his elbow in an off-the-ball incident.

FIFA has now issued the 26-year-old with a three-match suspension for breaching 48 par. 1 d of its Disciplinary Code, which relates to 'assaulting (elbowing, punching, kicking etc.) an opponent or a person other than a match official', as well as a Â£13,000 fine.

Song, who issued a statement apologising for his conduct after the match, will now sit out Cameroon's final group match against Brazil later on Monday and, as the Indomitable Lions have no chance of progressing, he will also miss his country's next two official matches after the tournament.

A FIFA statement read: 'FIFA can provide the following disciplinary update in relation to the expulsion of Alex Song of Cameroon in their match against Croatia on 18 June.

'The FIFA Disciplinary Committee decided today to suspend Song for three matches and impose a fine of CHF 20,000 for breaching art. 48 par. 1 d) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC).

'The first match of this suspension is to be served in the upcoming World Cup fixture between Cameroon and Brazil on 23 June 2014, with the remaining two to be served at the next official matches of the Cameroon national team in accordance with art. 38 par. 2 lit. a) of the FDC.'
