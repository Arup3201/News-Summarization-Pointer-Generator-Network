The family of an air-stewardess killed in 9/11 have hit out at the makers of Oscar-nominated Zero Dark Thirty for using her voice without their permission.

The opening of the hit film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow and starring nominated actress Jessica Chastain, features the voice of Betty Ann Ong recorded on a call just before her American Airlines flight hit the north tower of the World Trade Center.

The terrified stewardess called into her company's operations center to tell them the plane had been hijacked.

Controversy: Five time Academy Award nominated Zero Dark Thirty has found itself in controversy since its release. A 9/11 victim's family are the latest to speak against the film

The family of the 45-year-old Massachusetts flight attendant said they want a public apology from the film-makers at tomorrow's ceremony and a donation to a charity set up in her name, according to the New York Times.

They also want the film's distributors Sony Pictures Entertainment to state on their website and on the film that the Ong family does not condone torture.

Betty's brother Harry Ong told the newspaper: 'I thought it was just outrageous, and totally poor judgment, and an abuse of the voices.'

The five-time Academy Award nominated film is based on the hunt to find Osama Bin Laden and his ultimate shooting in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2 2011.

With the tagline: 'The story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' it follows the work of determined agent Maya, based on a real CIA operative who masterminded the US's discovery of the Al Qaeda chief.

The film has faced plenty of criticism since its opening - not least through its depiction of water-boarding and other torture in the CIA's attempt to find Bin Laden.

Family's outrage: Members of the Ong family are unhappy with the use of Betty's final call in the film. Betty is pictured far left next to sisters Gloria and Cathie and brother Harry, in front of their parents

There were also reports today that the film has been 'unofficially' banned in Pakistan as the country is unhappy with its depiction.

The family reportedly wrote with their complaints to the film's writer and producer, Mark Boal, on February 15.

Mr Boal, who won a Writer's Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay, would only email a one line response to the newspaper.

'As the 9/11 commission justly proclaimed, Betty Ong is without a doubt one of our national heroes,' it read.

Sony Pictures claims both Mr Boal and the film's director have been in close contact with victims families - many of whom have been invited to private screenings.

'Zero Dark Thirty, is in some small way, a tribute to those forever affected by the attacks,' it said.

The New York Times also points out Sony have already contributed to the ground zero museum and memorial.
