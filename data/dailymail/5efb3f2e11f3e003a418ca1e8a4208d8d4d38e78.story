A teenager charged with strangling an 18-year-old whose naked body was found on a footbridge expressed his shock at the death in a TV interview one day before he was arrested, it has emerged. 

In a chilling twist, Maxwell Sherman, also 18, of Long Beach, New York, told CBS 2 that he was 'amazed' and 'surprised' at the brutal murder of Lauren Daverin.

The woman, who had recently married, was discovered dead on a footbridge in Rockville Centre on Thursday night after spending time with friends. She had been stripped naked apart from her boots, and her clothes were piled nearby.

Accused: Maxwell Sherman, 18, leaves for his arraignment in Hempstead, New York on
Sunday for allegedly murdering Lauren Daverin. Hours after the killing,
he spoke to a local TV station about his shock

Tragic: Miss Daverin was strangled on the footbridge where she and her friends loved to hang out

In the interview near to the scene, 
Sherman told the news reporter that he had seen Ms Daverin at about 7pm 
on the night she died.

He said: 'I met her for like five minutes.' 

Sherman,
who is unemployed and living at his affluent parents' second home in 
Long Island for the summer, said the woman had been chatting with 
friends and he stopped to speak to one of them for a cigarette.

When
CBS 2 news reporter Carolyn Gusoff described the murder to Sherman, who
was not a suspect at he time, he raised his eyebrows in apparent 
surprise.

Sherman is wearing the same shirt in his mugshot as in the interview and scratches are visible on his face.

Sherman,
who appeared in court on Sunday, has denied the killing. He was charged
with second-degree murder and will appear again in court next 
Wednesday.

His parents, who had been out of town, were flying back to New York on Sunday night.

A couple renting out the bottom floor of the Shermans' Long Island beach home told the New York Post that he randomly asked them for drugs.

'His parents are just nice, normal people,' one neighbor said. 'They told me he's a bit of a troublemaker.'

Ms Daverin was married to a U.S. airman, according to friends, who was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

Her husband Kashawn
Graham, who is also from Nassau County on Long Island, has flown back 
home to help Ms Daverin's family with funeral arrangements. 

He
was at Nassau County Court in Mineola alongside Ms Daverin's family to 
see Sherman arraigned and broke down in tears when the suspect was 
brought into the courtroom.

Heartbroken: Family and friends, including Daverin's soldier husband, embrace at the court on Sunday

Sadness: The family heads into court where Sherman was charged with second-degree murder

'To
my wife: You will always be loved a lot, and you made me the luckiest 
man in the world,' he wrote in a message left at the crime scene.

The family declined to comment while at court, but a representative said family members 'just wish for justice'.

Family and friends will gather at a funeral home in Hicksville on Monday night to remember the young woman. Her burial will be held on Wednesday at the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury.

Ms Daverin's family have urged friends to write on a memorial that has been set up on the bridge where she died. Almost 5,000 people have also joined a memorial Facebook page.

A picture posted on a Facebook 
tribute site showed a board with 'in loving memory of' surrounded by 
candles at the bridge. Her family say they will use the messages of 'love' at her 
funeral.

Friends say she was at the Mill Pond footbridge drinking and smoking on Thursday when her friends left her alone. But when they returned an hour later, they found her brutally murdered.

Brutal: She was found stripped naked except for her boots and her clothes were in a pile nearby

Crime scene: She was discovered at the Mill Pond footbridge and emergency responders pronounced her dead

They called 911 and when authorities arrived they ruled her dead on the scene at 10:15pm.

Friend Laura Barabasch, 18, told the New York Post that Ms Daverin was a bit of a 'wild child,' but that she was beloved by her friends.

Miss Barabasch said the footbridge where Miss Daverin was found murdered was a spot where she loved to hang out.

'The bridge we hang out on is a real fun place. I’ll come back here to remember her and all the good times we shared,' she said.

Despite her reputation for partying, she was extremely popular among her friends and classmates.

'In my life I never 
thought I could feel such loss and sadness,' her mother Katherine 
Daverin wrote online. 'My little girl was taken from me 
last night. And there not enough words to sat that will ever make it 
better.

Memories: Friends remember Daverin as a bit of a 'wild child' but altogether a great person who was loved by many

'Lauren I love you so much and my life will never be the same without you. Goodnight my child I love you.'

Emily Westermann described Daverin as a social girl who had a lot of friends.

'I don't know why this happened to her, how this happened to her, but she didn't deserve that,' she said.

Daverin's family have refused media interviews, but have expressed their feelings of loss on a Facebook memorial page.

'Every
part of my heart is broken, and I cannot wait to meet you again in 
another life and make sure I appreciate every hug and every kiss and 
every fight,' her older sister wrote.
