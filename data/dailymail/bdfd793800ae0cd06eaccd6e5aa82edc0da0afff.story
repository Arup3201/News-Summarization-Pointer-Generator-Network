A group of Irish cyclists who travelled to Liverpool to raise money for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster had their bikes stolen –  outside Anfield.

The six intended to take part in a 96km charity ride across the city to mark the 25th anniversary of the tragedy that left 96 football fans dead.

But after taking a tour of Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, they returned to find their bikes, equipment and clothing worth more than £30,000 had been stolen from their van, which was parked nearby.

The team were all members of the charity Cycle 4 Sick Children and were fundraising for families of the 96 Liverpool football fans died at Hillsborough in 1989 killed in Britain’s worst ever sporting disaster.

Last night campaigners spoke of their shock and disgust at the theft of the bikes.

James Leech of the Justice for the 96 campaign said: ‘This is a truly despicable crime.

‘These six fundraisers were riding in support of a charity and deserve to be welcomed to Liverpool - they were guests in our city for a good cause. Instead they were left stranded without their bikes. It really is sick.’

On the Hillsborough Family Support Group page on Facebook, fellow campaigners were equally horrified. 

Paula Oulton said: ‘Not everyone in Liverpool is like the scum that did this, please don’t tar us all with the same brush. I find this disgusting, disgraceful and totally unacceptable behaviour and the robbers should be public ally named, shamed and flogged.’

Maxine Gibbs said: ‘Let’s hope the thief who took them can read so they see this disgusting act. In time one of their kids could be using that charity. What comes around goes around.’

Liam Murphy, who along with his wife Stacey founded of the charity after their daughter was diagnosed with a rare heart condition, said they were all devastated and begged the thieves to return the bikes.

He said: ‘When we came out from the stadium we discovered the van window had been smashed and all bikes, passports, equipment and cash had been stolen. I feel sick to the stomach actually.

‘It’s really hard to put in words what this has done to us as we were over here to support the victims of Hillsborough.

‘With it being the 25th anniversary and so many of us being Liverpool fans, it is a subject that is close to our heart but this has just devastated us.’

The 96 kilometre bike ride was due to take place across Merseyside with all the money raised going to the charity.

Mr Murphy said the theft left them without any cash and they were forced to return home yesterday.

Police have given descriptions of the stolen bikes to all officers in the area and have pledged to do 'whatever it takes' to help the riders take part in the race.

Chief Inspector Chris Hitchell said: ‘This is an absolutely terrible thing to happen to anyone visiting our city but it is made worse by the fact that this group are here to raise money for charity and a cause which is dear to so many Liverpudlians’ hearts.

He added: ‘Everything possible will be done to identify the offenders responsible for this despicable theft and I would call on people within the local area to help us get these bikes back quickly.

‘All five are very distinctive and I would urge anyone who knows where they are being hidden or offered for sale to do the decent and honourable thing and call the police or Crimestoppers.’

‘The victims have travelled all the way over from Ireland to raise money for the families of the Hillsborough victims and they are understandably distraught at what has happened.

‘We and the community will do whatever we can to help them so that they can still take part in tomorrow’s ride.’
