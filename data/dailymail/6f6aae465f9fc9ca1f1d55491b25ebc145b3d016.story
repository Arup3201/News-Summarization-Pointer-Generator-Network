Sentenced: Tomas Speed, 19, of Axminster, Devon, admitted 
three charges of raping a 12-year-old girl

A loner groomed a 12-year-old girl for sex after winning her trust through Facebook conversations about break-ups and bereavement.

Tomas Speed, 19, of Kirby Close in Axminster, Devon, admitted three charges of raping the girl, as well as taking indecent images of her.

The court heard Speed - described as 'naive and immature' by mental health workers - had become isolated from his friends and family following the deaths of his father, and later his step-father, in the years and months before he began an internet relationship with the young victim.

The assaults happened after the pair agreed to meet at Speed's family home in September last year.

Although both parties said intercourse was consensual, Speed was convicted of rape because his victim was under the age of 13, and therefore cannot be deemed to have granted consent.

Speed admitted the offences and was given a two-year sentence at a young offenders’ institution when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court today.

Prosecutor Richard Crabb said Speed began talking to his victim on Facebook last summer.

'Within a short time, the conversation turned to sex,' he said.

'They were aware of how old they were. He (Speed) asked how far she would go.

'There was an element of grooming.'

They met for the first time two months later, when they had sex.

They subsequently met again, at Speed’s family home, during which time he used his mobile phone to video sex acts.

Mr Crabb said the police were called in after the victim’s mother discovered images with a sexual content on the girl’s phone.

Speed, who told police he was 'a loner', was arrested and immediately made 'full and frank admissions', the court was told.

Defending, Sarah Hornblower said Speed’s naivety had 'a huge impact' on why the incident had occurred.

She told the court Speed said the victim 'presented as somebody very mature for her age' and that the conversation was initially based on 'break-ups and bereavements' in both families.

Miss Hornblower said: 'He (Speed) had a very poor relationship with his mother. His father died when he (Speed) was 14, and he was angry that he had not listened to medical advice (relating to a terminal illness).'

The court was told Speed’s mother formed a new relationship with a man the teenage boy was 'very close to'.

However, the step-father’s death in May last year from cancer prompted Speed to become 'a recluse', the court was told.

Miss Hornblower added: 'He sought solace from somebody who approached him on Facebook.

'He was naive and immature.'

Speaking outside the court, a Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman described the sentence as 'fair on both parties'.
