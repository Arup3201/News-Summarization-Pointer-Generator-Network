Bad girl: Kym Marsh has been accused of fly-tipping rubbish bags

Coronation Street star Kym Marsh is to appear in court accused of allowing rubbish to be dumped after her soap scripts were allegedly found in bags at the side of the road.

The 36-year-old, who plays Michelle Connor in the soap, claims she is the innocent victim of a scam after a man offered to remove the rubbish, which had piled-up at her home during renovation work.

The mother-of-three is facing prosecution under environmental protection laws after bags were found by a road in Worsley, Greater Manchester, close to the home she shares with her fiance, the actor Jamie Lomas.

It's understood the rubbish included 
bags of rubble and Coronation Street scripts, which council officials 
traced back to the actress.

Kym has allegedly been summonsed to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later this month.

If found guilty of any offences she could be fined.

Kym claims a man in a high-visibility jacket called at the couple's home and offered to remove the rubbish for Â£60.

A
spokesperson for the star told the Manchester Evening News: 'Kym paid 
someone in good faith to remove the rubbish which had accumulated as a 
result of work at the house.

'She
didn't think any more of it until she heard from Salford council, who 
wanted to speak to her about rubbish dumped on the roadside.

'She
immediately went straight to the council and explained what had 
happened and was told that if she didn't hear anything within six weeks 
that would be the end of it.

'This is the first she knew about the summons.'

The spokesperson added that Kym had felt 'horrified' and 'very angry' after finding out the rubbish had been dumped.

Kym, 36, reportedly plans to marry Hollyoaks star Jamie, 37, at plush Nunsmere Hall Hotel, in Cheshire, in September.
