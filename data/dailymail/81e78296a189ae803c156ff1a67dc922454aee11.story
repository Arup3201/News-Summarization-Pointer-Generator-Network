A New Jersey father is outraged after officials at his daughter's school accidentally released the child to a complete stranger last week.

Gemar Mills, 31, from Paterson, says staff at Dale Avenue School put the life of his 3-year-old daughter, Madison, at risk by allowing her to go home with a woman who mistook the toddler for her granddaughter.

The grandmother had not seen her granddaughter for nine months when she went to the Paterson school last week to pick up the girl, also named Madison.

Explanation: The administration of Dale Avenue School said the mix-up occurred because the grandmother had not seeing her granddaughter for nine months, and the child was also named Madison

Two staff members at the pre-K school signed off on the toddler’s release and sent her home with the woman, who reportedly kissed and hugged Madison, according to The Paterson Press.

It was not until the 3-year-old arrived home that the mix-up became apparent and Madison Mills was promptly returned back to the school.

But according to Gemar Mills, his 3-year-old, who suffers from a peanut allergy, could have died in the time it took the other family to bring the child back.

‘The grandmother said, “I took her to the store and I gave her a granola bar,"’ Mills told NBC New York. ‘Well, she has a peanut allergy, so it was a miracle she didn't eat the peanut version.’

Officials at Dale Avenue School realized that Madison Mills was sent home with the wrong person when her mother called the school to say she was coming to pick up the toddler, but was told that the girl already had been picked up by someone else.

'Within minutes, the school principal realized the mistake and she worked quickly to ensure the child was returned safely to the school, which she was (within 30 minutes). Our head of security was notified, and so was the child's mother.' school spokeswoman Terry Corallo said in a statement.

Close call: Mr Mills said the woman who picked up his daughter, who suffers from a peanut allergy, bought her a granola bar, which luckily did not contain nuts

Mr Mills, who himself is a school principal at Malcolm X Shabazz High School in Newark, said his young daughter was left shaken by the incident. 

Furious: Mills, who works as a school principal, said officials at his daughter's school were negligent 

‘She keeps telling me, “I went to the lady's house and then the man yelled out, 'That's not our baby, bring her back,’’ he said. ‘She remembers that stuff.’

Gemar Mills added that little Madison is now afraid to go back to school because she does not want to end up with the other family.

According to the father, officials at the Paterson school, which has some 340 students from pre-K to second grade, failed to contact police to report his daughter missing in violation of their own policy, and then contacted the grandmother instead of calling him or his wife first, 7Online reported.

‘How can we trust that they're going to keep any child safe?’ he wondered.

The school administration has suspended a security guard and a teaching assistant without pay for allowing letting Madison Mills go home with a stranger. In the aftermath of the mix-up, the school now requires adults to show identification before picking up a child.

Mr Mills has reported the incident to child protective services and contacted an attorney. Meanwhile, the school district has hired an investigator look into the matter.
