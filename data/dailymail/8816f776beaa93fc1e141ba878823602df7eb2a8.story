She's preparing to move stateside to support her footballer beau so Christine Bleakley is looking forward to spending some quality time with her family this December.

Christine, 35, has been living in Cheshire while fiance Frank Lampard is on loan to Manchester City, the sister team of New York City FC. 

However, due to his sporting commitments, the couple won't get to spend quality time together over Christmas.

Speaking about her plans for the festive season, Christine said: 'It is always a family affair at Christmas. Frank is often away for most of it playing football and I often have my family over to London. 

'Last year Frank was here for some of Christmas Day and we had his girls over too so there was quite a few of us celebrating. My mum normally does the cooking as I would say I am quite average but I would always help her out.' 

The TV presenter plans to join Frank in New York and return to the UK sporadically for work. 

Speaking candidly about his partner, Frank recently insisted that wouldn't want to remain apart for too long.

And while 2015 will bring a new stomping ground for Christine, she doesn't believe in New Year's resolutions. 

She said: 'I have got to the point now when I feel there is no point starting a New Year’s Resolution as I often find it hard sticking to them but when I do, I normally just try to eat healthier and avoid having snacks around the house so much.

'Also make sure I get to the gym as often as I can, which I’m normally quite good at doing.'

The results are clear to see. Christine shows off her enviable physique in her new campaign for Soft & Gentle deodorant.

Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I love the change in season and love getting into the winter time. I have to buy a new coat and boots in the winter as a staple treat for myself.

'I love Olivia Palermo. I’ve always liked her and the American LA look, I think she looks beautiful in every picture you see.'

Speaking about how her look has developed over the years, she said: 'I would say I have become a lot more simple in terms of style and really like clean, fresh looks. 

'I like tailored clothes especially the Victoria Beckham collection, which suit my shape and I’m not great with loose things.'

Describing herself as a 'bag girl' rather that a shoe aficionado, Christine explains that her favourite tote is one that Frank brought her five years ago and was her first expensive bag. 

'It was a lovely small, simple Chanel black bag which gets an outing at least once a week,' she added.

Fashion heroines: Christine says her beauty icons are supermodels from the golden age such as Cindy Crawford, while she loves Victoria Beckham's clothes and New York socialite Olivia Palermo's style

While she labours over her fashion choices, glamorous Christine maintains that she can get ready in 15 minutes.

She takes cues from the age of the supermodels and thinks that Cindy Crawford was 'one of the most beautiful women' in the world.

'I think she and Catherine Zeta Jones are both stunning, always look amazing and don’t ever seem to age. 

'In terms of more up-to-date celebrities, I would say Jennifer Aniston always comes across as being very natural and fresh looking and looks great for her age.'
