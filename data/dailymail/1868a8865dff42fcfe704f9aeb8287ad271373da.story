Nina Holmes, 22, died after a night out in a bar at a Bulgarian ski resort

A British woman has died at a Bulgarian ski resort after allegedly after buying cocaine from a local dealer.

Nina Holmes, 22, from Swansea, collapsed outside a bar in the resort of Borovets on Sunday night.

Eight other British nationals were taken to hospital following a night out in the area - which is 45 miles from the capital Sofia - prompting a police investigation.

Today, Miss Holmes's family spoke of their shock as her body was flown home.

A family spokesman said: 'We don't know what happened and we are waiting to find out from the authorities in Bulgaria.

'They are bringing Nina's body back today and that is the most important thing for us right now.

'Everyone is so upset - it's a very difficult time.'

Miss Holmes's parents were away on holiday in the Caribbean when they were told of the tragedy - and flew home immediately.

The family, which runs a well-known travelling fairground company in Gorseinon, live in a luxury caravan in a yard where their fairground rides and amusements are stored for the winter.

A neighbour described Miss Holmes as a 'lovely, smart girl' who was 'full of life'.

'She is from a fairground family and they are highly respected in Gorseinon - they have been here for years,' she said.

South Wales Police said it was aware of the incident and would be working with Swansea coroner Philip Rogers once Ms Holmes' body was repatriated

'When we heard she had died people 
thought it was a skiing accident to start with but now we have been told
 it could be a rogue batch of drugs.

'I am surprised - that wasn't her lifestyle at all.'

Earlier
 today, Miss Holmes's boyfriend Dean Herbert wrote on Facebook that he 
was flying back to Britain with his girlfriend's body.

He wrote: 'Sleep tight my babes, promise you're coming home.'

He also wrote: 'Nina your my world,super star We just bounced of each other and loved every second of being with u (sic)' .

The resort was described by one holidaymaker as 'like Ibiza but with snow'.

An eyewitness said Ms Holmes was seen falling to the floor in BJ's bar just metres away from police.

'She just came out of the bar, feeling not good and passed away.

'Just five metres away there was a police car and the cops witnessed her death.

'A local female drug dealer has been detained for allegedly selling Nina the deadly dose.

'Her premises have also been searched.'

Tests are being carried out on the 
drug sold to the British tourists and police confirmed a local resort 
worker was being questioned on suspicion of supplying cocaine.

A woman who met Miss Holmes and her boyfriend on Sunday during a ski lesson said: 'It's really scary.

'She seemed like a really nice girl who was here to have a good time with her boyfriend. It's so sad.

'Borovets in the night is a real party town. But you don't expect something like this to happen.

'Everyone
 - fellow skiers, reps, ski instructors and pub and club workers - are 
really shocked and saddened by what has happened.'

In the meantime, as news of the death 
filtered back to Wales friends tributes have begun to pour in for the 
popular rugby fan - whose family run a local well known amusements hire 
company.

Friend Steve Maitland Thomas described Ms Holmes as funny, beautiful and happy.

He wrote: 'I am deeply saddened she is no longer with us. Deepest sympathies to Terry and her loving family.'

And Hayley Ravenscroft left a message reading: 'Watched you grow from a lovely little girl to a stunning young lady now.

'A beautiful angel you are gonna be missed by so many in and out of showland. Keep doing what you do best and rock heaven.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national on February 2 in Bulgaria.
