Dunkin Donuts is testing a new kind of breakfast sandwich they're hoping to make mouths water: a glazed donut sandwich.

The sticky new item featuring two crisp slices of bacon and a 'pepper fried egg' is appearing in select eastern Massachusetts outlets according to the company.

But before those calorie counters turn away, the voluptuous new menu item is said to be a shockingly low 360 calories according to a Dunkin' spokeswoman.

Adding up the ingredients, one regular glazed donut according to their website is approximately 260 calories leaving a roughly figured 100 calories' room for the bacon and egg, a spokeswoman confirms.

There aren't any set plans to expand the menu item nationally as of yet, however, with reviews of the item still coming in according to the company.

'We are pleased with the response so far, however, we cannot share any specific sales data. That said, the product has only been in restaurants for two days so we have limited information available,' a Dunkin' spokesperson told the Atlantic Wire.

The item would be sold at a suggested retail price of $2.99.

Such an item isn't exactly new, however, at least for other food outlets.

'I'm game if you are!' she enthusiastically tells her co-host after revealing the eye-catching ingredients for a segment that appeared on the Food Network.

In early 2012 Paula announced she has Type-2 diabetes, several years after The Lady's Brunch Burger was invented.

Other items like donut ice cream sandwiches have been seen at smaller eateries around the country.
