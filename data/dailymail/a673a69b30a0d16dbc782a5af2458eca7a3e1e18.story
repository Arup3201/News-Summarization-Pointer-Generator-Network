The family of a toddler left disfigured after police threw a stun grenade into his playpen are 'devastated' that the officers involved will not face any charges.

Bounkham Phonesavanh, known as 'Baby Bou Bou', lost part of his nose and left nipple, and suffered burns to his face, brain injuries and a collapsed lung when the grenade exploded while he was sleeping on May 28.

But after hearing evidence for six days, this week a Georgia grand jury opted not to charge any SWAT officers who took part in the botched drug raid in which the 19-month-old was injured.

The Phonesavanh's family attorney Mawuli Davis told CBS 46 Atlanta: 'We are reviewing the grand jury findings with our client.

'They are devastated and trying to comprehend the gravity of this decision.

'This is a very sad day for this family and for the people of Georgia.'

The incident occurred while Bou Bou's mom Alecia Phonesavanh was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta.

They were living with relatives after their Wisconsin home burned down earlier that year. 

The Habersham SWAT team executed a no-knock warrant on the property while searching for a relative they believed was a drug dealer and had a cache of weapons inside, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported. 

The search turned up neither guns nor drugs. Wanis Thonetheva, who did not live at the property, was arrested later that day and charged with possession of methamphetamine.

Surgeons repaired the child's lung so he could be removed from the ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion, as well as treating injuries to his lips and mouth

Bou Bou spent five weeks being treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta before returning home in July. 

Surgeons repaired the child's lung so he could be removed from the ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion, as well as treating injuries to his lips and mouth.

Last month, the family learnt that public officials refused to foot the $800,000 medical bills for Bou Bou's treatment that they had 'publicly promised to pay'.

The attorney for Habersham County stated, 'The question before the board was whether it is legally permitted to pay these expenses.

Baby Bou Bou before his injuries. The child was a happy and healthy baby boy before the incident 

 'After consideration of this question following advice of counsel, the board of commissioners has concluded that it would be in violation of the law for it to do so.'

When asked how Bou Bou was doing ahead of this week's announcement Mr Davis told CBS Atlanta, 'He is still recovering. He had to have a surgery about a month ago which required 60 stitches to his face and 70 stitches to his chest.'

He added, 'The baby will likely have to have these kinds of surgeries every two years until he reaches the age of 20 because his nerve endings in his face have been so severely damaged that they will continue to have to do these plastic reconstructive surgeries throughout most of his life.'

In the wake of the incident, Mrs Phonesavanh has spoken out about what she feels is the abuse of power by police officers.

She said: 'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves.

'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them.'
