They chanted ‘Lewis, Lewis’ and he sang the word ‘England’ over the radio, raised himself in his seat and saluted the Silverstone fans with a shake of his right hand. The summer of British sport had finally found its winner to hail.

The Union Flags were waved and he spun his Mercedes in celebratory doughnuts. ‘Jeez, I can’t believe it,’ said Lewis Hamilton, the Dr Jekyll who won despite starting as Mr Hyde as sixth on the grid.

Once he had driven across the grass to get closer to the fans on that euphoric lap of honour, up on the podium he was handed the winner’s trophy - a plastic toy that would not have passed muster in Hamleys: a lattice work of red in the image of the sponsors, Santander.

This bauble had sadly replaced The Royal Automobile Club Trophy, which was originally awarded at the first Grand Prix staged at Silverstone in 1948. ‘Where’s the gold trophy, man?’ asked Hamilton, who is a notably more attached to his awards than most drivers.

The proper trophy, which is always guarded by heavies, awaited him in the press conference room, standing on the table between the winner and Valtteri Bottas, who took second place for Williams with a fine drive.

‘I grew up seeing trophies like this one — real trophies,’ said Hamilton. ‘While it is a real privilege being on top of the podium, my trophy fell to pieces. It must have cost £10. It’s so bad.

‘I might just get the plaque, which is the most expensive part of it. These trophies are what you have to show for your lifetime’s achievements. I hope we can get some better ones in future.’

The trophy was later escorted to the Mercedes motorhome in the paddock, before returning to its case at the RAC, Pall Mall.

The story of how Hamilton came to win either trophy here is a tale of guts and good luck. He started down the grid because of perhaps the strangest mistake of his Formula One career: he aborted his final qualifying lap, not realising he could have improved his time on the later and drier section of the track.

Rosberg carried on and took pole, making him favourite to extend his 29-point lead in the duel between the two men driving the Silver Arrows. Hamilton, though, charged up at the start into fifth by the first corner and fourth within a flash.

Later in the race, having jinked his way to second place in his super-fast Mercedes, he was closing on Rosberg at the rate of about a second a lap.

There was a good chance he would have passed his rival in any event, but he did not need to because Rosberg’s gearbox failed halfway through.

The German sat on the grass, waving away a marshal while he attempted to restart his machine. He finally conceded defeat and walked away, his race over.

Hamilton had no challenger from that moment onwards. ‘Every lap I was saying to the car, “don’t break down”.’ It did not and he won by 30 seconds.

It may not have been his 67sec demolition in the wet here in 2008 — arguably the best of his 27 victories — but its significance was immense.

Had he lost further ground to Rosberg, especially following his qualifying faux pas, the psychological advantage would have been squarely with the German. Now the gap stands at four points going into the next race, at Hockenheim a week on Sunday.

Hamilton deserved his slice of fortune after suffering a race-ending technical gremlin at the opening race in Australia. This evens out the score — the problem Hamilton suffered in Canada, it seems, was because he did not change his brake bias and over-worked his rear brakes.

Away from the leading pair, it was an eventful race from the start. Kimi Raikkonen crashed heavily on the first lap along the Wellington straight while accelerating to 180mph. He ran off the track, came back on, spun off and hit the barrier with an impact of 47G before skewing back across the tarmac, taking Felipe Massa’s Williams with him.

He went to the medical centre with bruised knees and ankles. The barrier had come off worse. It took an hour to mend, the long red-flag delay something of an irritant to the 112,000 crowd.

The racing excitement centred on Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso and Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel. Alonso swept past Vettel on the outside of Copse; they then diced with eachother — the wheels of one fitting like a jigsaw piece into the curves of the other’s chassis — until the Red Bull man finally overtook the Ferrari to claim fifth place.

‘It got a little bit silly,’ said Vettel of the joust and the frantic radio exchanges.

2. Red Bull - 168 pts

3. Ferrari - 106 pts

4. Williams - 103 pts

5. Force India - 91 pts

There were nearly two British drivers on the podium through Jenson Button, but he could not quite catch Daniel Ricciardo’s Red Bull.

‘It was almost a great day,’ lamented the McLaren driver. ‘I think one more lap would have done it. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn’t.

‘We definitely gave it our all. To get fourth is far better than we expected. Maybe the time I get on the podium will be when I win.’

It was a bitter-sweet experience in another way for Button as he paid tribute to his father John, a universally liked paddock figure who died in January. Jenson donned a pink helmet and fans wore pink shirts — the colour John put on for luck on race days.

‘I can see his face now,’ said Button. ‘When I walked out of the motorhome, he would have shaken my hand, winked, and said, “Go on son, this is your time”.’

‘It was the perfect sort of race for him. He would have been a very happy man.’

Just as Lewis’s father Anthony was. An occasional caller these days, he smiled as the national anthem played. It was like old times.
