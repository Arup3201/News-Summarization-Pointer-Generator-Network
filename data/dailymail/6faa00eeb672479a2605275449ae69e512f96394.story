Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez and Newcastle United are in disagreement over his readiness to return to Premier League action.

The 31-year-old's contract expires this summer and the Magpies had been willing to allow him to return to Argentinian club Velez Sarsfield earlier this month.

That move broke down at the last minute and Gutierrez has since returned to Tyneside and declared himself fit for first-team football, tweeting: 'Healthy and ready, now is a board decision'.

He also said: 'I'm available. I know there is a situation with my contract and I don't know if I'm going to get the opportunity to play again.

'I'm ready and I want to, but I know other things have to happen to be back.

'What I can do is work hard and to be ready if the situation changes.'

John Carver is unsure whether Gutierrez will be ready to return to the first team before the end of the season

Newcastle fans are desperate to see the popular winger at St James' Park just one more time before he leaves at the end of the season.

Gutierrez has been building fitness with the club's reserve team since being given the all-clear from testicular cancer for the second time in November.

He told Sportsmail last month that it was his 'dream' to play again for United, but that is looking increasingly unlikely.

Head coach John Carver said: 'A little bit of it (whether he will play again) is in his hands.

The Argentinian is a favourite with the Newcastle fans, who would love to see him play for the club again

'He can play (for the reserves), but you know when you're ready to go at Premier League level. I am waiting for the right time and it's not right at the moment. I can see that on the training ground.

'He has come back from a serious situation and I'm not putting any pressure on him.

'I don't know (if he will play again). I'd like to think so. It's got to be right. He's got to get in the team, in his position. He has to compete to get on the left hand side and there is a lot of competition there, more than we've had for a long time.'

The best Gutierrez can perhaps hope for is an emotional cameo at the end of the season, especially as there is likely to be little riding on Newcastle's final few matches.

Carver was handed the Newcastle job until the end of the season but is yet to impress the fans

Of that prospect, Carver said: 'At this moment in time it's too early to say that. Let's see what happens as we get towards the end of the season.'

One factor complicating the situation slightly is that Gutierrez has a clause in his contract which, after eight appearances this season, would trigger an extension to his deal.

The club will not allow that to happen but fans are still hopeful of them affording him a farewell outing.

In the meantime, Gutierrez's next appearance in black and white is likely to be a week on Monday when the Under-21s entertain Stoke at St James' Park.
