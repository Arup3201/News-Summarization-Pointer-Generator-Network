A teenager who killed another pupil by repeatedly punching him in the head was secretly placed in a new school before he could be sentenced.

The boy was just 14 when he killed 14-year-old classmate Euan Craig, after a row in their school gym.

However, following the fatal attack the teenager was moved to a new school in Glasgow - where pupils and even most of his teachers were unaware he was due to be sentenced for culpable homicide.

Victim: Euan Craig, 14, was repeatedly punched in the head in a row in his school gym. After the fatal attack the killer was secretly moved to a new school

He spent three weeks at the new secondary school after admitting the killing in May 2012.

As a pupil at his previous school, in another area of the Scottish city, the killer had erupted into a rage when fellow pupil Euan 
accidentally hit him with a sponge ball in the school gym.

Euan,
who had been aiming at one of his friends as he waited for his teacher 
to arrive only to catch the killer on the side of his face, immediately 
apologised.

However, the other boy walked up to him and hit him approximately five times on the side of 
the head, as Euan tried to back away and shield himself from the blows.

Throughout the attack Euan continued to say sorry for throwing the ball.

Euan then went to sit on a bench with other pupils, but slumped from his seat suffering a seizure.

A teacher rushed to help him, but he did not respond.

Euan was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered massive bleeding in his
brain, and he died the following afternoon after suffering from the 
freak head injury.

A pathologist concluded that Euanâ€™s fatal brain haemorrhage was caused by him being struck on the left side of his face.

After
a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh, the killer was sent to a young 
offenders institution by judge Lord Bracadale, who told the teen he had 
no option but to impose a custodial sentence.

He had told the teenager: 'I
have come to the view that the sustained nature of the assault, the 
circumstances in which it was committed and the devastating consequences
which flowed from it combine to indicate that, despite you age, the 
only appropriate disposal is a custodial one.'

The court had been told that according to the boy's school report from his first school, he was a quiet boy whose behaviour was generally good.

Glasgow City Council were obliged by law to continue providing him with education, even after he admitted to the killing.

Rather than being tutored at home, the 
schoolboy started at his new school in September last year, just months 
after Euan's death.

He admitted culpable homicide on October
25 last year, but remained at the school, which has more than 1,000 pupils, 
until November 16 - one week before he was sentenced three-and-a-half 
years in detention.

Only a few select staff members who had direct contact with the teenager were told of the boy's background.

'(The teenager's) arrival at the school was conducted in complete secrecy,' a source close to the school told the Daily Record.

Sentenced: At a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh Judge Lord Bracadale said he had no choice but to impose a custodial sentence

'There
should never have been any question about schooling him at home but 
instead, education officials put him back in the classroom.'

The
source said that most parents were not informed of the boy's presence at
the school, although the chairman of the Parent Teacher Association was
told.

His identity remains hidden because of his age when the crime was committed.

Euan's parents, Richard and Ann, and legal experts have questioned whether it was appropriate to place him in a busy secondary school, instead of him having lessons at home.

Mr Craig, 45, raised fears that a pupil at the new school may have recognised the boy and confronted him.

His wife, 44, said the family still had unanswered questions relating to the attack, including why Euan's class had been left unsupervised.

Scottish Shadow Justice Minister Graeme Pearson also said that given the nature of his crime, there should have been more consideration into whether the killer could have been home schooled.

He said: 'We really need to challenge whether the right decision was taken to send [him] to another school after he pleaded guilty to such a terrible crime, particularly as other pupils and parents were oblivious to what dangers they might have faced.'

A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: 'A multi-agency full risk assessment was carried out prior to the move and the parent council fully involved in the decision.

'As a council we have a duty of care to educate every child.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
