In an age where foreign imports are regularly given preference over home-grown talent in England's top flight, Burnley showed they are doing their bit for British football. 

When Sean Dyche's men lined up before facing Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, there was a real homely feel to their squad. 

That's down to the fact that in contrast to their opposition, each of their starting eleven was born in Britain - something that has not occurred in the Premier League since the closing game of the 2010-2011 season.

Burnley's starting line-up against Tottenham on Saturday consisted entirely of British-born players 

Burnley are  18th in the league, level on points with Crystal Palace who are above them on goal difference

Blackpool were the last Premier League side to field an all-British starting eleven against Manchester United on the final day of the 2010-2011 season. Here's how they lined up.

Matthew Gilks - Rochdale

Stephen Crainey - Glasgow

Neal Eardley - Llandudno

Ian Evatt - Coventry

Alex Baptiste - Sutton in Ashfield

Keith Southern - Gateshead

David Vaughan - Rhuddlan

Charlie Adam - Dundee

Jason Puncheon - Croydon

Gary Taylor-Fletcher - Liverpool

DJ Campbell - Hammersmith

That team in question was Ian Holloway's Blackpool. He fielded a side entirely made up of British-born players against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Holloway's men suffered a 4-2 defeat and it was a similar story on Saturday as Burnley lost 2-1 at White Hart Lane. 

Following the defeat against Mauricio Pochettino's squad of global stars, Dyche spoke openly about his Burnley Brits.

'We are not necessarily a young group, but we're quite an inexperienced group as regards regular Premier League football.

'We've got a group who've maybe had a season in it, but it would be nice to have a few more who've been around it a long time,' Dyche said. 

While Dyche trains his thoughts on possible incomings, he knows that the speculation regarding Clarets striker Danny Ings' future is unlikely to go away any time soon.

The 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer and Newcastle and Sunderland have been mooted as potential destinations.

'We don't need to ignore it, we're just used to it,' Dyche said.

'He's used to it, I'm used to it. It's not a new story - people were talking about Ingsy last year from the beginning of the season so we're used to it.'
