Student Raffaele Sollecito, who was cleared of the brutal sex murder of Meredith Kercher, has revealed how he had sex with former girlfriend Amanda Knox the first night they met.

Italian Sollecito, 28, was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher, but the pair were freed last October after their convictions were overturned due to a lack of evidence.

Now Sollecito has been pictured enjoying a party lifestyle and promoting a new book which is set to shed light on his relationship with Knox before the death of Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University.

In the book he reveals how he ended up sleeping with Knox on the very day they met.

The revelations in his book, which he wrote about the case with British author Andrew Gumbel, is expected to earn him more than Â£1million when it is released next week in the United States.

Describing his first intimate night together with Knox, 25, he said: 'I showed Amanda around and invited her to plop down on the bed while I loaded a film on my computer.

'Of course, by the time I settled in next to her, all thoughts of the movie were quickly forgotten and we pulled each other's clothes off before the opening credits finished rolling.

'When I woke up the next morning, Amanda still had her arms wrapped tightly around me. I remember feeling safe and warm in a way I hadn't since I was a little kid.

'We related in a sweet, almost childlike way, maybe because we didn't share a native language.'

In Honour Bound: My Journey To Hell And Back With Amanda Knox, the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25-year-old blonde American, who he met just a week before tragic Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house.

The murder made headlines around the world and the pair were famously photographed kissing and cuddling outside the scene of the crime - and in the ensuing trial Knox was portrayed as man-hungry and her boyfriend as an obedient puppy.

Sollecito also revealed how he became jealous when just days into his relationship with Knox he discovered her on Facebook chatting to her former boyfriend David Johnsrud.

He says: 'I asked who he was. Right away, she explained that she, like Meredith, had left behind a boyfriend when she came to Italy. His name was David Johnsrud, known as D.J., and they were still in regular contact.

'In fact, they chatted or e-mailed almost every day. D.J. was spending his junior year in China, and given the distance, it hadn't made sense for them to stay together as a couple.

'I could tell just by looking at Amanda that she was still attached to him. Even though we'd only known each other a few days, I had fallen for her - and it hurt.'

He also describes the moment he met Knox again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009.

Sollecito said: 'I wasn't just nervous about setting eyes on her again. I felt I was suffering from some sort of associative disorder, in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for Amanda without being overwhelmed by an instinctive, involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her.

'Two different Amandas - the real one, and the distorted, she-devil version I had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind.'

Knox and Sollecito were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of Meredith's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed.

Knox performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on Sollecito's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie, the American promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had 'wild sex.'

In his book Sollecito admits their behaviour was 'odd' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated.

He admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had 'each other' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing.

At their first trial which ended in December 2009 Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 years after they were found guilty of murder and sexual assault. A third man ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 25, has also been convicted and he was initially given 30 years but this was reduced to 16 on appeal.

Knox herself has kept a low profile at her home in Seattle since the murder but like Sollecito she has also signed a multi million dollar book deal and it is due out next year.

Sollecito is in the United States ahead of next week's book launch and he is not expected to return to Italy until next month following a TV appearance on CBS.

His father Francesco, speaking from his home near Bari, said: 'Raffaele has been in America for the last few weeks finishing off the final details on the book and preparing for the presentation next week. I think it will take place in New York.

'For the moment it won't be coming out in Italy and there are no immediate plans for the book to be translated into Italian. I haven't read the book yet and I only know a few of the details.

'I can't say for certain if Raffaele really did write that he and Amanda were smoking marijuana in the house the night Meredith was killed - to me it's a minor matter but on the other hand it does prove that Raffaele and Amanda were doing something else while the poor girl was murdered.

'Once the presentation is over and he has given his TV interview he will return to Italy and resume his university studies in Verona. As far as I know he hasn't meet up with Amanda while he has been in the United States but they do speak regularly.

'The most important thing is that we are waiting hopefully for the decision of the Italian Supreme Court in March when they will both be finally cleared and this nightmare will be over.'

Sollecito has spent most of the last month in the United States and his Facebook page shows him in San Francisco where he worked with the book's British author Andrew Gumbel and also most recently in New York.

His Facebook profile shows him as being friends with Amanda's sister Deanna and her step sister Delaney as well as her step mum Cassandra.

Under his profile he describes himself as 'honest, calm, positive young man but an incurable daydreamer.'
