A conman who wore a Royal Marines uniform to trick people into donating cash for Help for Heroes has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

Liam O'Brien, 32, stood outside train stations and other public places with a red Help for Heroes bucket.

He claimed he was a serving sergeant in the special forces who had been given authorisation by the charity to collect the much-needed money.

But a court heard that O'Brien was a convicted fraudster with no military links who pocketed the money himself - including more than £500 in a single day.

He was caught when he tried to board a train, again in full uniform, using a fake military free travel pass and a suspicious inspector noted his details.

When police searched his home they found five military ID cards in bogus names.

A CV claiming to list military experience and a letter of recommendation from Brigadier General John Quintas of the Air Force were also found.

They also discovered a folder of credit card details belonging to guests at a hotel where O'Brien had worked.

He was jailed for three and a half years yesterday after admitting 12 counts of fraud.

Swindon Crown Court heard he had a lengthy list of previous convictions beginning when he was 17, which included numerous charges of fraud using the military.

Judge Peter Blair QC told him: 'The public standing of a charity and the trust of a public in a charity is a very high and important standard that needs to be maintained.

'By behaving in this fashion you have risked a very serious goodwill damage to that charity and I regard that as extremely heinous.'

He added: 'These sentences will get longer and longer if you keep offending in this way.

'I hope in time you reflect on this behaviour and you will find better things to do with your time when you are released.'

The court heard that O'Brien, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, started his scam just days after being released from prison in December 2013 following an 18 month sentence for fraud.

He applied to collect for Help for Heroes with the intention of conning the public again.

In April last year he tried to board a train in Chippenham wearing a military uniform, including the coveted green Royal Marines beret, and showed a ticket collector a letter from the Department of Transport giving him free travel.

Before police were able to arrest him he turned up at the same station a month later, again in uniform, and approached a different inspector.

The inspector followed him on board where he noticed O'Brien quickly changed out of his clothes.

Unaware of the ongoing investigation into his background, O'Brien appeared outside London's Victoria Station in October purporting to collect for Help for Heroes.

Tessa Hingston, prosecuting, told the court: 'The defendant was wearing a full military sergeant's uniform and was using a red Help for Heroes bucket.

'He was challenged and a witness took a picture of his ID.

'The charity said O'Brien had applied to be a collector in December 2013 but had the authorisation rescinded in Februrary because he made no donations and didn't return any merchandise, including a so-called 'shop in a box' worth £250.

'On November 4, the defendant was seen boarding a train at Bath Spa where a police officer recognised him.

'He was in possession of two Help for Heroes buckets, one of which he had collected £513 in small change.

'Again he was wearing the uniform of a Royal Marine Sergeant and had two fake ID cards and a letter purporting to be from Help for Heroes authorising him to collect.'

Tony Bignall, defending, said: 'A large extent of why he was detected is because he went back to the scene of the original crime.

'You would have thought having had his details photographed he would have got away from there, but there seemed to be - if not a death wish - then no great attempt to conceal his actions.

'There is no hint of self pity and he doesn't ask anyone to give him any either.'
