Five-year-old Boyd James, pictured with his dad Sam, has been left scarred for life after the horrifying incident

A five-year-old boy has been left scarred for life after an acidic drain cleaner leaked through his bedroom ceiling as he slept.

Boyd James woke up in the early hours of the morning screaming that his face was ‘on fire’ after the powerful liquid dripped onto his bed.

The occupant of the upstairs flat in Blandford, Dorset, had earlier poured the sulphuric acid-based cleaner down his kitchen sink in an attempt to unblock it.

But the liquid was so strong that it melted the pipes, floor and ceiling before leaking onto Boyd.

The acid in the cleaner, called 'One Shot Instant Drain Cleaner', melted his pillow and caused the five-year-old's skin to bubble and blister.

Horrified mother Kayleigh, 24, splashed cold water over the youngster’s face in an attempt to relieve his pain.

Mrs James spotted brown liquid seeping through the ceiling before calling the emergency services and her husband, Sam, who was at work at a butchers.

The family evacuated the ground floor flat while firefighters arrived at the Georgian property and forced their way into the upstairs flat believing there to be a fire.

But instead they found a gaping hole under the kitchen sink where the drain cleaner had burnt through.

Paramedics spent two hours treating Boyd at the scene in Dorset.

The five-year-old is expected to be left with chicken pox-like scarring to his face but has been told he was fortunate not to have been blinded or even killed.

His mother said she first knew something was wrong when her son ran into the hall screaming that his face was burning.

'I thought he must have had a bad dream but I then saw his face was red, so I took his hands away and his lips were burning,' she said.

'It was bright red and blotching, blisters were breaking out and his skin was bubbling around the nose.

'Then I saw brown liquid all over his pyjamas so I ripped them off and started covering him with water in the bathroom.

Boyd's pillow was almost completely melted after liquid from the powerful drain cleaning solution, also pictured, dripped down onto his bed

'The children were both sleeping in Lyla’s room so while I was in the bathroom with Boyd I pulled Lyla towards the door, and then I saw the liquid pouring through the ceiling.

'It was melting (and) just burning through it.

'They managed to treat Sam in the ambulance and it’s a real miracle he didn’t need skin grafts.

'It’s horrible. You put your children to bed and think they will be safe.

'I can’t believe this product is on the market, if it gets into the wrong hands who knows what damage it could cause.'

Fortunately, Boyd's two-year-old sister Lyla, who was sharing her room with Boyd at the time, was left unharmed following the incident.

Boyd's father, Mr James, 28, said that paramedics had warned that his son was lucky to be alive: 'It was a frightening experience.'

The male occupant of the upstairs flat is believed to have bought the cleaning fluid from a local hardware store.

The label of the cleaning fluid states that it contains 91 percent sulphuric acid.

A spokesman for the Hull-based company which manufactures the drain cleaner refused to comment today.
