Two boys who became trapped after a plow operator pushed snow over them survived for four hours thanks to a pocket of air, police said.

Cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11, were recovering in the hospital after being dug out of a snowbank in Newburgh, New York, early Thursday morning. 

Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday.

During their search, officers learned that the boys had been building a snow fort in the area of the nearby Family Health Center.

They boys had been digging the fort out of the snow bank, when the plow truck came through and trapped them, police said. 

Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank.

'After I saw the shovel, I just felt compelled to dig,' said 28-year-old Brandon Rola, a member of the Newburgh police force for 7 years, to FOX News. 

'I really didn't put it together, but I just started digging.'

The officer took the shovel and started to dig, and saw a small boot. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands, and the boys were found.

When police found a small boot, they called for paramedics, fearing they may have arrived too late. That is, until another officer, John Maguire, saw the boot start to twitch.

'When John saw that, we just started digging like crazy,' Rola said. 'But we only had the one shovel, and you're talking about a 7 or 8-foot snowpile.'

'We knocked on doors, got shovels, and pretty soon, we had maybe 10 people working on that pile.'

The rescuers finally reached the two boys, who were suffering from exposure but still conscious after being trapped for around four hours unable to move their arms or legs.

'Thank goodness, they were bundled up in layers, so they were warm enough,' said Rola.  

'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.'

Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them.

Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition.

After getting some much-needed rest, Rola woke up to a Thanksgiving with his own family, conscious of the dramatic rescue hours before. 

'It was a good day,' he said.
