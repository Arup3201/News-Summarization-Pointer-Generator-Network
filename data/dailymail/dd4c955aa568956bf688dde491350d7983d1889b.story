Boris Johnson took a swipe at George Osborne’s plans for visa reform yesterday – as the potential Tory leadership rivals went head to head in China.

The London Mayor, whose aides are irritated by Mr Osborne’s presence on the trip, suggested that an overhaul of Chinese visas does not go far enough.

In the first part of a week-long charm offensive, the Chancellor announced plans to fast-track the visa system for wealthy Chinese tourists and businessmen.

But Mr Johnson, who has campaigned for a much more liberal regime, said: ‘We will have to see how this scheme actually works. The detail is a little bit unclear to us at the moment.’ 

Mr Johnson yesterday went out of his way 
to steal the limelight from the Chancellor, with a series of florid 
speeches and interviews.

His bid to win over students at Peking University misfired slightly when he joked that Harry Potter’s first kiss with Chinese Hogwarts pupil Cho Chang illustrated the future for China and the UK.

But critics pointed out that Cho Chang is thought to have been Scottish and the relationship quickly fizzled out.

Mr Johnson insisted he and the Chancellor were like ‘a pair of harmonious doves’.

Mr Osborne, whose speech was received in near silence, replied they were like the ‘yin and yang’ of politics.

But behind the scenes there is some 
resentment in the Mayor’s camp at the Chancellor’s decision to time his 
visit to China to coincide with Mr Johnson’s.

Chinese banks will be able to apply to set up wholesale branches in the City of London under plans announced by George Osborne.

The Chancellor described the move, agreed with China after two days of talks, as 'good for UK jobs and investment'.

The Prudential Regulation Authority will enter discussions with Chinese banks in London which will allow them to apply to set up wholesale banks in the UK.

Chinese banks will not be able to open high street branches under the plans but will be able to conduct business with other banks and companies.The agreement also contains plans to cement London's position as the global hub for trading in the Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) by giving investors the chance to invest RMB directly into China through London under a pilot scheme.

Mr Osborne said: 'A great nation like China should have a great global currency.

'Today we agreed the next big step in making London - already the global centre for finance - a major global centre for trading and now investing the Chinese currency too.

'More trade and more investment, means more business and more jobs for Britain.'

The Mayor had hoped to 
be the first senior British politician to visit China following a recent
thaw in relations, which had been in the deep freeze since David 
Cameron met the Dalai Lama last year.

But Mr Osborne then announced he would 
visit China at the same time - a move which some in the Johnson camp 
view as a ‘spoiler’. 

Both men yesterday faced criticism for failing to raise China’s abysmal human rights record with communist party officials.

Amnesty International described the pair’s attitude to China’s human rights record on their visits as ‘disappointing’.

Allan
Hogarth, of Amnesty UK, said: ‘We are very concerned about continued 
use of the death penalty in China, police torture and harassment of 
human rights and political activists and minority groups, and 
restrictions on freedom of expression.’

Mr Osborne said the purpose of 
the trip was to strengthen trade relations with the emerging economic 
superpower.

He said Britain should show more respect for China and stop treating the country like a ‘sweatshop on the Pearl River’.

He added that there was ‘no limit on the amount of business we can do together.’

Meanwhile,
the Mayor said it was not his role to challenge China on human rights 
adding: ‘I don’t walk into a meeting and say, “I say, you chaps, how’s 
freedom doing?” ’

'I’m not 
saying there isn’t a role for the British government to stand up for 
what is right in the world, or what the British government sees as being
right.

'All I’m saying is 
it’s not really my core function as Mayor of London to go around 
aggrandising myself in that way and presuming to take on all the pomp 
and panoply of foreign secretary and international relations and all the
rest of it.’

However Mr Johnson's attempt to sell 
Britain's relationship with China mis-fired with a Harry Potter 
analogy which lacked magic.

The
London Mayor is in Beijing talking up closer links with China, claiming
it was like the wizard's first girlfriend 'Cho Chang - who is a Chinese
overseas student at Hogwarts school'.

But
the latest attempt to upstage Mr Osborne quickly unravelled, with fans of the JK Rowling 
series pointing out that Cho Chang was British, and their relationship 
fell apart soon after starting.

Highlighting Britain's close relationship with China, Mr Johnson drew on the literary works of JK Rowling.

Speaking at a Q&A session at 
Peking University, he said: 'If you want one final proof of how fast the
world is changing, the cultural interpenetration between Britain and 
China, let me ask you a question, brilliant students of Peking 
University.

'Who in English
literature is the most famous student? Who is the most famous student 
in contemporary British writing, would you say? I will give you a clue -
he sometimes has a wand... Harry Potter.'

He
went on: 'Where does the train go from which Harry Potter has to catch 
to go to his school? King's Cross, absolutely right, which is where? 
London.

'Where does Harry Potter buy his 
uniform and his wand and stuff like that and his books? I think it's in 
Diagon Alley which is in London. Where is the location of the Ministry 
of Magic? London.

'And who 
according to JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter novels, was 
Harry Potter's first girlfriend? Who is the first person he kisses? 
That's right, Cho Chang - who is a Chinese overseas student at Hogwarts 
school.

'Ladies and gents I rest my case. I don't think I need to argue any further, that is the future of Britain and of London.'

However,
it was quickly noted that Cho Chang was not described as a Chinese 
overseas student in the series of novels, and was played in the films by
British-Asian actress Katie Leung with a Scottish accent.
