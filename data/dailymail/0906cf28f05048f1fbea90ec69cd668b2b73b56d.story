Chris Huhne’s hopes of staying in the Cabinet if he is charged over speeding allegations appeared to be crushed by Nick Clegg yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister warned it would be a ‘very serious issue’ if the Crown Prosecution Service charged Mr Huhne over claims he asked  ex-wife Vicky Pryce to take speeding points for him.

Mr Huhne could be charged with perverting the course of justice as early as this week after police won a court battle to gain access to explosive emails sent by Miss Pryce. Allies of the Energy Secretary have indicated he may make an astonishing attempt to cling to his job if he was charged.

Lib Dem colleagues: Chris Huhne and Nick Clegg

Just around the corner: A decision on the court battle between Chris Huhne, left, and his former wife Vicky Pryce, right, is expected within days

Third party: Constance Briscoe revealed that she had given information to the police in relation to the speeding offence allegation

Describing his mood as ‘bullish and 
confident’, one pointed out that the ministerial code did not require 
ministers to step down automatically if they were a defendant in a 
criminal case – only that government lawyers must be consulted.

However, Mr Clegg made it clear that 
the Government would want to be seen to uphold the ‘highest standards of
probity’ among ministers. Significantly, he also appeared to open the 
door to a return to government for David Laws if Mr Huhne was forced to 
quit. 

Mr Laws was considered a rising star 
until he was found guilty of breaching expenses rules. He was one of the
Lib Dem negotiators who hammered out the coalition deal with the 
Conservatives then joined the cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury
– Chancellor George Osborne’s right-hand man.

Mr Clegg said: ‘We as a 
Government want the highest standards of probity to be in place in 
everything that is done by Cabinet members.’  

When asked about Mr Laws, he said: ‘I
would like to see David Laws back in government – not just because I 
admire him a lot and he is a close colleague and friend of mine.

‘I just so happen to think he would 
be very good for the Government and good for Britain. In my view, he’s 
got one of the most sophisticated minds in British politics.’

New love: Chris Huhne with Carina Trimingham - he left his wife of 25 years for her

The way was cleared for a swift 
ruling on the case after the publishers of The Sunday Times dropped a 
High Court challenge to a court order requiring emails relating to the 
allegations to be produced to Essex Police.

Sources say the messages implicate 
the embattled minister, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In an 
unusual step, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said 
the CPS was ‘very close’ to making a decision, with the emails being the
final piece of the puzzle.

It yesterday emerged that evidence 
from part-time judge Constance Briscoe will play a key role in the CPS 
decision.

Respected economist Miss Pryce is reported to have confided in
the judge, who is a family friend, that Mr Huhne asked her to say she 
was at the wheel of the car when it broke the speed limit in 2003. Miss 
Briscoe last year said she remembered the conversation during which she 
advised Miss Pryce to tell Mr Huhne to ‘go away and come clean’.

The Huhnes’ 25-year marriage broke down in June 2010 when Mr Huhne left his wife for former aide Carina Trimingham.

If the speeding allegations are 
proved, Mr Huhne could be found guilty of perverting the course of 
justice, and jailed for up to six months. Detectives are said to believe
Miss Pryce should also be charged with attempting to pervert the course
of justice.

A friend of Mr Huhne’s said: ‘He’s characteristically 
bullish and confident. Vicky barely uses emails. It’s the least 
important bit of the evidence.’

Meanwhile, Mr Clegg yesterday insisted that 
state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will not be allowed to lavish bumper 
bonuses – from a pool estimated at £500million – on its bankers.

Hundreds of traders and investment 
bankers who were bailed out by taxpayers are expected to share in a 
total pot of about £2.5billion – an average of nearly £140,000 each.

But Mr Clegg said: ‘We have been 
very, very clear that in RBS – and for that matter, in other banks – the
bonus pool has got to be considerably lower than it was last year.’
