Are you single? Are you a woman? Are you confused as to how this state of affairs has come about? Emily Hartridge may be able to explain.

The British presenter and YouTube comic - whose tongue-in-cheek 10 Reasons Why... series has had 4.6m hits, gained 30,000 subscribers, and prompted belly-laughs all over the world - has come up with a new list of theories pointing out the real reasons why you're still unattached.

And they include being needy, acting like a bit of a 'lad', jumping into bed with men too quickly, intimidating potential suitors with your success... and having far too many cuddly toys.

Are you a single woman? Emily Hartridge is here to explain why

Are your cuddly toys turning men off you?

Hartridge acknowledges that as a single woman herself she is essentially taking the mickey out of her own situation in the new video blog. Then again, she does seem to have found a handsome chap to assist her with her latest entry: adorable baby nephew Arlo.

Sidekick Arlo ('I'm not sure how much help he's going to be since he can't stand up by himself') watches as his auntie rattles through the reasons why women are single, and they include drinking too much, smelling bad, looking a bit of a mess, being too fussy, and simply going after the wrong type of man.

This week baby nephew Arlo helps Emily explain why single women stay... single

Filming in high definition camera for the first time, the popular (and often controversial) chatterbox explains that there is 'a certain stigma' attached to being single.

She goes on to demonstrate why being too needy is 'apparently not an attractive quality in a woman'; how owning too many cuddly toys and 'treating them like people' can be quite frightening to a man; that 'getting smashed' alcohol is for some reason not pretty; that men can be scared of a woman's success; that men can be scared of a woman's face; and that bad smell can put off a man.

Drinking too much is apparently not an attractive quality in a woman

Emily Hartridge says perhaps you smell, are too needy and need to many compliments...

Maybe 'you slept with them too quickly and didn't make them earn it', or perhaps you're too fussy and pick holes in every man you see... or could it be that you simply pick the wrong guys?

She ends the video explaining that men seem to like 'girly-girls' they can look after, and that if you're too much of a lad or tomboy (like Emily says she is), they might be turned off.
