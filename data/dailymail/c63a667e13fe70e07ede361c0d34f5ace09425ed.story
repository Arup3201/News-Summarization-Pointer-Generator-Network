Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi (above), who ruled for four years until 1912

The brother of China's last emperor who was pushed off the throne more than 100 years ago has died.

Puren was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi, who ruled for four years until 1912.

The 96-year-old died on Friday after being taken to hospital with pneumonia in February, his family said.

He had been suffering from poor health and memory loss in recent years.

One of his sons told The Legal Evening News that Puren - who took the Chinese name Jin Youzhi - was 'almost deaf'.

'He even couldn't hold a pen... he couldn't recognise people,' the son added. 

Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old. His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty, which began in 1644.

After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City, where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs.

They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917.

Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s. He reportedly had three sons and two daughters.

The Communist party which took power in 1949 also reportedly gave him a place on the local Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly symbolic body.  

A memorial for Puren will be held at the Babaoshan Cemetery in Beijing.
