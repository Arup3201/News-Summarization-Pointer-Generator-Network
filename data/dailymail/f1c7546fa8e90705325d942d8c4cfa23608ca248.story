were around the bus - it's unspeakable.'

NJ Transit cops are investigating and Simpson - who has been a NJ Transit driver for 21/2 years -  has been charged with reckless endangerment, lewdness and risking widespread injury.

'The tape speaks for itself,' said Mr Metz to the Daily News. 

'This would be an affront to any individual if this happened in front of them.'

A NJ Transit driver for 21/2 years, Simpson has removed from his Carteret-New York route, the agency said.

'The bus operator in question was immediately removed from service without pay, as a result of this disturbing and grossly irresponsible conduct,' NJ Transit spokesman John Durso told the website.
