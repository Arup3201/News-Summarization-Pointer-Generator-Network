Scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital found that the pill's powerful hormones can temporarily 'age' the reproductive system

Going on the pill could damage a woman’s future fertility - at least temporarily, a new study has revealed.

Researchers found that the powerful hormones can ‘age’ the reproductive system, reducing the production of eggs to levels seen in older women, months after coming off the contraceptive.

While scientists do not think the phenomenon is permanent, they advise that a woman’s ‘biological clock’ should be measured three months after finishing taking the pill.

The link emerged in a study of 833 women between the ages of 19 and 46 years old, who were attending a fertility clinic.

Experts measured anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicles (AFC) which are indicators of ‘ovarian reserve’ or fertility.

Levels of AMH and AFC were 19 per cent and 16 per cent lower in pill users.

In addition, between 19 per cent and 52 per cent less eggs were produced by the women taking part in the study, with the greatest reductions seen in those under 30.

Dr Kathrine Birch Petersen, of Copenhagen University Hospital, said: ‘We expected to find an effect of the pill. But during the project we were surprised at the quantified effect on ovarian reserve parameters as defined by anti-Mullerian hormone, antral follicle count and ovarian volume.’

Even after statistical adjustment for age, BMI, smoking and maternal age at menopause, AMH was still up to 30 per cent lower and AFC up to 20 per cent lower in pill users.

Dr Birch Petersen presented her results at a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Munich and said that they suggest measurements of AMH and AFC should be monitored in those taking the pill.

Researchers have found that a woman's sex drive is not affected if she meets her partner while she is already taking the pill.

However, women do see their sex drive fall if they stop taking the pill during a relationship, according to a study released last month.

Researchers from four British universities and Charles University in Prague studied 365 couples.

They investigated how sexual aspects of long-term relationships were influenced by women's use of hormonal contraception.

Lead researcher Dr Craig Roberts from Stirling's Division of Psychology said: ‘Our findings showed women who had met their partner while taking the pill and were still currently taking it - as well as those who had never used the pill at any point - reported greater sexual satisfaction than those women who had begun or stopped using the pill during the course of the relationship.

‘In other words, the congruence of women's pill use throughout the relationship had a greater influence on sexual satisfaction levels than either simply being on the pill or not being on the pill.’

She said: ‘We do not believe the pill changes the ovaries in any permanent way.

'But we still need to know more about the recovery phase after women stop the pill.

‘The pill is unlikely to change the basal ovarian biology of egg depletion - but it certainly changes the appearance of the ovaries and the secretion of AMH.’

Dr Birch Petersen said women in the pre-conceptional care programme in Copenhagen who have been on the pill ‘are now advised their ovaries may look old with small volume, a few small antral follicles and low levels of AMH'.

But she said this may not necessarily reflect their future fertility status.

In order to have a more precise measurement of the biological clock’s status and to reassure the pill user about her fertility potential, ovarian reserve assessment – the capacity of the ovary to provide egg cells that are capable of fertilisation - might be repeated three months after stopping the pill.

She said that the pill could mask a severely diminished ovarian reserve and this is important to recognise.

Most women are able to become pregnant six months after stopping the pill.
