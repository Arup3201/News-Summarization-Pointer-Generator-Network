The devastation caused by Colorado’s Waldo Canyon wildfire is so severe that the burn scar is clearly visible from space, as a incredible picture clearly shows.

The shocking photograph showing the worst fire in the state’s history was taken from Nasa’s Terra satellite on July 4th, as the fire raged on.

The photo was released as the fire was reported as 90 per cent contained having killed at least two people and forced approximately 32,000 residents to evacuate their homes.

The photograph of the burn scar in Pike’s National Forest shows unburned land in bright red, according to NASA Earth Observatory.

Light brown areas depict areas where some burning occurred while dark brown indicates areas severely burned.

The fire, which has been burning since June 23, has spread over 18,274 acres destroying almost 350 homes.

Yesterday, the Denver Post totalled the cost of the damaged homes to be a staggering $110 million and put the cost of fighting the blaze at $14.5million.

The 26-square-mile fire is one of many 
burning across the West, including eight in Utah and a fast-growing 
blaze in Montana that forced residents in several small communities to 
leave.

At the end of last month President Barack Obama  toured some of the most
heavily damaged sites after he declared the situation a 'major
disaster' and promised federal aid.

'One
of the things that happens here in America is when we see our fellow 
citizens in trouble and having difficulty, we come together as one 
American family, as one community,' Obama said on July 1.

Officials say they hope to have the fire fully contained by Friday.

However, mountainous terrain is posing tough conditions for the 776 workers fighting the flames, reported OurAmazingPlanet.

Investigators are still trying to 
determine the cause of the fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado’s history.  Dangerous conditions had kept them 
from beginning their inquiry.

More than 70 wildfires are currently burning throughout the U.S. with the largest active fires in south east Montana.
