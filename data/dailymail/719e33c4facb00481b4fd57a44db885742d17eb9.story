NEIL ASHTON: Bye bye, Jose! United agree record £37m fee for Chelsea star Mata

Juan Mata is expected to complete his move to Manchester United on Friday.

The £37million man from Chelsea is set to fly from Battersea in south London straight to United's training ground.

Sources close to the player have revealed that Mata has been told things are being put in place for his arrival at Carrington.

Flying visit: Juan Mata arrived in Manchester via helicopter as he closes in on his £37million switch to United

He has been told to be ready to leave his apartment in Chelsea at short notice and travel to a helicopter flight base in nearby Battersea.

Once in Manchester, the Spanish playmaker is due to have a look round United's impressive training base, meet manager David Moyes and then head to the Bridgewater Hospital near the city centre for a medical.

Back at Chelsea's training ground, Jose Mourinho was all smiles as he watched his players train ahead of the weekend FA Cup clash with Stoke.

United do not have a game as they are already out of the FA Cup but it is hoped that Mata will train with his new team-mates on Friday and be ready for next Tuesday's home game against Cardiff in the Barclays Premier League.

Out of sorts: Manchester United were knocked out of the League Cup after losing to Sunderland on penalties

Mata will arrive to find United at a new low after their numbing Capital One Cup shambles at home to Sunderland on Wednesday night. 

Moyes and his players are due at Carrington at 11am to warm down and go through the detritus of a night that ended in penalty shootout failure.

United agreed the club record fee for Mata to ease the pain of their Capital One Cup exit.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho signed off on the deal following talks with club executives. United chief Ed Woodward agreed to break the club's transfer record for Mata as they attempt to salvage their season.

On the move: Mata has spent most of this season on the bench after falling out of favour under Jose Mourinho

Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa's future has been thrown into doubt because of the proposed transfer.

The midfielder is attracting the interest of Spanish side Atletico Madrid this January.
