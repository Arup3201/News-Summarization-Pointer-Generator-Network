The 21-year-old woman filmed beating up an Ohio teen in a viscous attack outside a mall has played down the incident, saying she was just trying to put fear in the heart of the victim, who allegedly stole her car.

Police put out a warrant for the arrest of Cheyenne Fisher, 21, after a video of the Christmas Eve attack was uploaded to Facebook, showing a gang of six women assaulting Cheyanne Willis 19, whose hair was cut, had 'I got my a-- whopped' written on her forehead in eyeliner and slammed against the hood of a car.

However Fisher has now given an interview saying that Willis 'charged' at the group first in the suburban Cincinnati parking lot and that the subsequent fight 'was what it was'.

Fisher said she had loaned her car to Willis her Chevrolet Impala 'back and forth from work', but that Willis had not returned it for a month and was avoiding Fisher's texts.

'I didn't really punch her or anything - I just slapped her up and pretty much put fear in her heart,' Fisher told  WCPO.
