When the first official portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a fortnight ago it was greeted with a global eyebrow-raise you could practically hear.

Though Kate herself, 31, said Paul Emsley's likeness of her was 'amazing' and 'brilliant', and her husband Prince William told the artist it was 'absolutely beautiful', critics dismissed it as unflattering, ageing and even 'rotten'.

Now Emsley has bitten back at his critics, saying the aftermath of its unveiling felt like a 'witch hunt', but that there is still 'nothing I would have changed' about his painting.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, he said: 'Some of the words written about it were so personal. I'd be inhuman if I said it didn't affect me. When you take on commissions like this it is hazardous and you expect a bit of flak, but I expected nothing like the criticism I have received. I didn't expect it to go to the levels it did.

'It felt like a bit of a witch hunt and people who have not even seen my portrait joined in with what quickly became a circus. The worst thing is it was not only destructive to me, but particularly upsetting for my two daughters and my wife.'

He added: 'At first the attacks were so vicious that there was a point where I myself doubted that the portrait of the Duchess was any good. But now, I've had time to reflect, I am still happy with it and am getting on with my life. There is nothing I would have changed.'

The Duke and Duchess told Emsley, pictured with the couple, that they were thrilled with the painting

Emsley says that the praise of the Duke and Duchess meant more to him 'than anything else said or written', but that he would urge people to visit the National Portrait Gallery since he feels 'half the problem is that the portrait doesn't photograph well'.

According to the gallery, the number of people visiting since the painting went on display on 11 January has risen from 24,000 over that weekend, up nfrom 17,000 the week before.

The Telegraph reported that postcards of the portrait are the fastest-selling item in the history of the gallery's permanent collection.
