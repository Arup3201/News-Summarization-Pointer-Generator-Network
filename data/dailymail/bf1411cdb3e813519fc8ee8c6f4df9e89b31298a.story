Sean Penn has revealed that he watches propaganda beheading videos published by ISIS out of a sense of moral responsibility.

The actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips, in which Americans, Britons and Kurds have been graphically slaughtered, because 'real violence' is often hidden from us.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'The problem is we are not seeing enough of real violence. We are being anesthetized when you don't see the horror of war.'

When asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips, he replied that he did.

Penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts 'political correctness', which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in Iraq and Afghanistan from being kept off-screen.

He also mentioned the ISIS clips in relation to his own new movie, The Gunman, which will feature graphic violence.

Penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in Iraq and Syria are not the same thing.

He said: 'Anyone who sees them [ISIS videos] and claims that they were anaesthetised by violent movies, that they weren't horrified by what they saw, on the most primal level, is intellectually dishonest or existentially unpresent.'

Penn has voice his opinions about ISIS before - earlier this week he told Conan O'Brien that the terrorist organization was 'created' by George W Bush and Dick Cheney.

Beginning with former Vice President Cheney, whom he called 'an embittered bacteria [sic] of humanity', he said: 'These are the guys, he and President Bush and some others, who invented Daesh, or ISIS.'

The video ends with three ISIS fighters pulling out their knives and beheading their prisoner. Close up shots of the bloodied bodies are shown.

He sarcastically added 'thanks for that'.

Meanwhile ISIS continues to produce and distribute sickening videos of its barbaric executions.

Its warped criminal justice system has given rise to footage of people thrown off buildings for being homosexual, and having hands amputated for other crimes.

On Friday its latest beheading video was released, showing the killing of three Kurdish soldiers who had been taken prisoner.
