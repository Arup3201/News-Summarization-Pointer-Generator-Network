Even inside the United States, a nation well-known for its comparatively lavish tipping practices, not everyone can agree on how much gratuity to give food service professionals.

State-by-state, Americans vary wildly on how much they choose to give and to whom.

Using data from smartphone credit card payment company Square, Quartz put together some visuals that expertly tell tale of American gratuity from sea to shining sea.

Gratuity: An analysis by Quartz of data from mobile credit card payment company Square showed just where people do, and don't, tip. In front for largest tips at sit-down type restaurants was West Virginia and at the top of the pack for residents who tip most often was Illinois

By looking at many millions of credit card transactions at coffee shops, restaurants and food trucks, the data also pieces together where exactly a state's residents are more or less likely to leave a tip.

For restaurants, a category that appears to mean mostly sit-down eateries, the nation's top tippers can be found in the state of West Virginia.

In the Mountain State, patrons paying with Square leave an average gratuity of about 20.1 percent of the bill.

That's 3.6 percent higher than the 16.6 percent average tip left by diners across America.

The lowest-tipping state at restaurants was found to be Nevada, which clocked in with an average tip of 14.6 percent.

Worlds apart: The smallest tips across all eatery types were found in Delaware and the largest in Alaska

For coffee shops servers, Square's data show that people tip the most overall with an average of over 18 percent.

South Carolina is the kindest to those who make their cappuccinos where Palmetto State patrons give an average 23 percent tip.

Meanwhile, working the espresso bar in Hawaii means saying aloha to your tips. Residents there tip baristas on average 15 percent.

The last establishment category analyzed by Quartz was food trucks or carts. These tended to be the worst of the three for tips and the worst of the worst was Georgia, where truck employees can expect tips of 15 percent.

The best place to sling slop from the side of a vehicle is Iowa, where employees average 25 percent tips.

Across the states, the people who tip most often (as opposed to the largest) are in Illinois, with the Delaware residents appeared to tip the least often.

Who's to blame: Quartz also gave a state-by-state look at which states are nicest to their servers
