Surfers taking part in a California surfing contest this weekend had more than just their fellow competitors to beat.

A dozen dolphins joined the contestants as they took on the waves at the Rincon Classic in Santa Barbara on Sunday - giving spectators an even more dazzling show than they had expected.

People watching on the beach managed to capture the amazing display from the beach - at first showing the dolphins' fins appearing above the water.

Then the crowd whooped with joy as the animals lined up and rode the waves, coming within feet of the competitors in the water.

At
 one point, surfer Abby Brown found herself following the creatures as 
they soared through the wave ahead of her - and could do nothing but 
slow and watch them in awe.

The surfers stood no chance at beating the dolphins, who stole the show.

Dolphins are common in the area, although they rarely join in with surfers, ABC reported.

More than 200 surfers took part in the competition.

The Rincon Classic, which was founded in 1979, takes place between mid-January and late February when waves are at their best.

Videos of the dolphins have been shared on YouTube, where viewers have praised the footage.

'Never have I seen anything like this!' one wrote on a video shared by Frank Crowe. 'This is fantastic.'
