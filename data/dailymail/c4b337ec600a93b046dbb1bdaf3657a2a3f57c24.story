An audacious Celtic move to sign French international free agent Lassana Diarra until the end of the season has been foiled by red tape.

The Parkhead club explored a move to sign the 29-year-old former Chelsea and Arsenal star after learning of his willingness to move to Glasgow.

And plans were afoot to fly the combative midfielder into Glasgow to watch today’s SPFL clash with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Diarra’s former club Lokomotiv Moscow have thrown a spanner in the works, however, by refusing to release the Frenchman’s registration.

Diarra has been without a club since leaving Russia earlier this year. A move to Queens Park Rangers fell down in the summer and Celtic sources say the deal is now dead unless the player and his representatives can negotiate the necessary paperwork.
