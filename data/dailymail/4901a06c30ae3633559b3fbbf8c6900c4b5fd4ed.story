Maverick Tory MP Nadine Dorries says she would ‘love’ to take part in Strictly Come Dancing, despite being suspended from the party for entering the I’m A Celebrity jungle.

The outspoken backbencher revealed her hopes of a return to reality TV as she renewed her attack on David Cameron, claiming only an ‘idiot’ would think he will win the next general election.

And she backed the PM’s great rival Boris Johnson as a vote winner barely a month after returning from exile from the Conservative party.

Jungle: Tory MP Nadine Dorries, was suspended from the party for taking part in last year's series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! but now wants to be a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing

Ordeal: She was subjected to several Bush Tucker trials, including being buried in a coffin with bugs

Tory high command suspended Ms Dorries
as punishment for jetting off to be a contestant in I’m A Celebrity… 
Get Me Out Of Here last November without permission.

She was only allowed to return to the Conservative benches in May, after crunch talks with Chief Whip Sir George Young.

The
MP for Mid-Bedfordshire gave assurances that she would ‘follow the same
procedure as other Conservative Members of Parliament before going away
when the House is sitting’.

Defending her decision to take part in 
the show she claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions,
discussing important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit.

Instead she was pictured performing jokes with Linda Robson from Birds 
of a Feather and eating camel toe and ostrich anus in a challenge 
against ex-Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan.

Now
she has raised the prospect of stepping out on to the Strictly 
dancefloor as part of her one-woman campaign to reach parts of the 
electorate that traditional political programmes cannot.

She
said: ‘I definitely would do more reality stuff. My constituents 
absolutely love it, because they’ve got someone of their own, who they 
see in Tesco, on there.

‘I’d love to do Strictly Come Dancing – who knows?’ she said in an interview with Total Politics magazine.

She would not be the first politician to put on sequins and a smile in the name of entertainment.

Business Secretary Vince Cable took part in a Christmas special of the show in December 2010 when he partnered with ballroom professional Erin Boag.

But rules on impartiality meant he could not take part in the full Strictly series.

Former Tory MP Anne Widdecombe lasted until week eight in the 2010 series, despite being heavily criticised by the judges.

Judge Bruno Tonioli described her as like ‘a Dalek in drag’.

Strictly in 2010 with partner Anton Du Beke while Business Secretary 
Vince Cable, a long-time dance fan, partnered with Erin Boag for the 
2010 Christmas special

While waiting for the call-up from Sir Bruce Forsyth and the Strictly team, Ms Dorries revealed she has been writing a book.

She said:  ‘I’m not allowed to talk about it, but I loved writing it.’

Asked if it was fiction or non-fiction, 
she replied: ‘It’s ‘faction’ – it’s about Liverpool in the ‘50s. I can’t
say anything about it, but it was a very cathartic experience.’

Nadine Dorries revealed she will be ‘bald soon’.

The Tory MP went public last month with her trauma at discovering a bald patch.

She told Total Politics: ‘I realise I’m going to be bald soon.

‘Whereas in your twenties you can rock
that look, you can’t do it when you’re in your fifties like I am, and 
you can’t do it in my job.

‘I know Mo Mowlam rocked that look when she had chemo, but it is a very difficult thing to do.’

The rebel MP stepped up her attack on the Prime Minister, and suggested only the Mayor of London could win a Tory majority.

She said: ‘I understand it’s important to put out the message that we’re going to have a Conservative majority with Cameron… [but] the people who say that are foolhardy and setting themselves up to look like idiots.

‘There’s an element of political naivety and delusion; it shows disconnect from the general public.’

She said there is ‘no doubt’ that Mr Johnson will be leader of the Tory Party.

‘He’s won two major elections, and nobody else in the party matches that at the moment. We would be idiots not to have Boris. He’d take the party back to the highlands again pretty easily.’

She went on to claim that the coalition is ‘grinding down now’ and is at its ‘final ebb’.

While there was no chance of her getting a call in the next reshuffle, Ms Dorries took the trouble to rule herself out of reaching ministerial office.

She said: ‘I’d hate it, absolutely hate it. Imagine being the minister for paperclips and only being able to speak about paperclips, I’d hate it. I couldn’t actually think of anything worse.’

She also renewed her call for Tories and UK Independence Party joint candidates at the next election.

‘I’d have exactly the same values as the UKIP candidates standing against me it would make sense to talk about at least a joint candidacy.’
