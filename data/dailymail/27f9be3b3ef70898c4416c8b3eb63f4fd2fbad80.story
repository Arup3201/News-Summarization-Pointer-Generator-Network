It’s one of the most innovative uses of a shipping container ever seen - but this single mother’s only child hasn’t quite yet made her mind up about whether she likes living in what is essentially a shed.

A California woman calling herself Lulu has created an astonishing 160 sq ft home for $4,000 after turning the structure into a living area with insulation, windows, cabinets, doors, water and heating.

The mother decided she needed a bit more space and so she also built a bedroom for her and her daughter on a flatbed trailer from which she can watch the moon rise, reported faircompanies.com.

Our house: A woman calling herself Lulu has created an astonishing 160 sq ft home for just $4,000 after turning a shipping container into a living area with insulation, windows, cabinets, doors, water and heating

Innovative idea: The California mother decided she wanted to spend a little more time with her daughter

Small space: She admitted the storage container was 'a little daunting' because she is claustrophobic

She admitted the storage container was ‘a little daunting’ because she is claustrophobic, adding that the trailer is ‘a nice looking shed - but it's really an 8 by 16 shed with windows in it’.

Her daughter is unsure about the home. The girl told faircompanies.com she does not like her loft bed ‘because I can’t sit up or stand up’, reported the New York Daily News.

‘She's definitely complained at times, but I also know that we have spent way more hours than I would have if I had to pay rent,’ Lulu told faircompanies.com.

Lulu moved out of her home and decided she would rather spend time with her daughter than work, so spent a month turning the storage container into a home complete with heating and water.

Bed: She said the trailer is 'a nice looking shed - but it's really an 8 by 16 shed with windows in it'

She also used recycled building materials including sinks and floorboards to build the new home.

Lulu

The home is based in someone’s backyard and she pays them only a small rent for water and electricity. Her only other expense is her butane tanks.

‘I showed this to my brother in Argentina and he said: “You've always like poverty with a lot of style. Always like elegant poor”,’ she told faircompanies.com.

‘Material things - all of it is on borrow right, we're all just borrowing stuff,’ she added.
