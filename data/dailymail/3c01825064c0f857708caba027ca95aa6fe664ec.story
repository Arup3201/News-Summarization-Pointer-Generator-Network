Elle Macpherson is back with a brand new series of Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model. The judging panel has been refreshed with two new faces, The Hills star and Teen Vogue model Whitney Port, and U.S. male supermodel Tyson Beckford, who join Elle and outspoken Welsh designer Julien Macdonald for this eighth series.

The 20 finalists were selected from auditions across the country for their model potential and what BINTM have dubbed 'fashion fierceness'.

The girls this year are the strongest yet, says Julien Macdonald. 'I think this is the best selection of young girls we’ve ever had. They are energetic and they capture the essence of the look at the moment and of what is going on in fashion, youth culture and modelling. I don’t know who will win but I think they will be the best winner we’ve had, with the most potential.'

Elle agrees, saying this groups is the 'most skilled' yet.

'This particular bunch of girls has been the most skilled as far as modelling is concerned,' Elle says. 'We have seen girls start strong and get stronger, and we’ve also seen girls start strong who have not been able to maintain it because looks only go so far.

'Versatility, stamina, sense of humour, courage, willingness to try new things, being flexible, reinventing themselves... there are a lot of challenges for them. A gorgeous girl can come in and then leave in the first couple of episodes because she doesn’t have that range. By the time they get to the last shows, these girls are really skilled.'

And Elle says the brand new judging panel is a hit.

'It’s been absolutely amazing working with Whitney, who is a great role model for my girls,' she said. Tyson is gorgeous and of course Julien isJulien! He is on great form, he’s fun and sexy and looks great. He’s gorgeous, and thin, this year. I think the dynamics are really cool and fresh. We all have a different perspective on the business and the girls and we have different ways of giving feedback.'

In tonight's episode, the group will 
be in for a few surprises as Elle Macpherson unleashes the unexpected on
the nervous girls.

The group meet at the St Pancras 
Renaissance Hotel in London, where host Elle Macpherson reveals their 
first challenge – a catwalk in front of Top Model fans and members of 
the press, and of course, Elle herself. 

Elle says: 'I want to see your 
personalities, I want to understand who you are, your personal style.' 
Some girls struggle with nerves in front of the crowd, while others work
the catwalk and sparkle with model potential.

But as Elle gathers the girls to give
her opinion, she has a surprise in store: 'I don’t think I’ve seen the 
best of you all yet, so I really need the help of my fellow judges.  Now
unfortunately they’re not here at the moment, so I guess what we’re 
going to have to do is go and join them. .. in Dubai!  Never before on 
Top Model have we taken 20 girls on a trip, so you guys are really 
special... I’ll see you there.'

But it's not long before the claws 
come out, and the girls find themselves fighting soon after arriving in 
Dubai. Personality clashes come to a head as the girls discuss their 
competition. 

Madeleine is singled out, with Anita 
voicing that she 'cannot stand' her.  Although others defend her, 
believing that 'she’s just very confident,' Diona adds that she finds 
her character to be 'very aggressive.'  Amelia concludes 'she’s come 
here to win, not to make friends.'

It's just a taste of things to come as tensions will no doubt reach boiling point as the show unfolds.

Watch this space as we report on all 
the drama, from the highs and lows inside the house to the evictions and
interviews with the girls.

Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model airs tonight and every Monday at 9pm Sky Living.
