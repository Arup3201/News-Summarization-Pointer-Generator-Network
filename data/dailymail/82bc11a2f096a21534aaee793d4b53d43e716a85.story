The opening credits of Sex and the City, in which a tutu-clad Carrie Bradshaw is splashed by a passing bus bearing her image, are probably some of the most famous of all time.

Now the costume designer of the much-loved Nineties TV series has revealed that the tulle skirt in that now-iconic sequence was a $5 bargain find.

Patricia Field told Emmy TV Legends that she and the show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, had fallen in love with the look, and between them, they persuaded producer Darren Star to use it.

Bargain find: The tulle tutu in the opening credits of the Sex and the City TV series cost just $5, the show's costume designer Patricia Field has revealed

She revealed: 'I was in a showroom and there was a
bucket on the floor, for like, $5 each or something, and I 
pull out this tulle skirt, and I’m like, "I don’t know, let’s just take 
this. We’ll see."

Simple styling: Ms Field, who also created costumes for Ugly Betty and the Devil Wears Prada, paired the tutu with a simple T-shirt

'So when I showed it 
to Sarah Jessica, she loved it. And I said, "Okay, so we’ll put it with a
little T-shirt," and she loved it. She 
felt it.

'And then we had to convince Darren.
He didn’t get it. I don't blame him - it’s not his thing. And we were 
coming to him with something strange, in his mind. So we had to convince
him.'

Ms Field, who also created costumes for Ugly Betty and the Devil Wears Prada, went on to explain that it was one of four options considered for the opening credits, one was a tight-fitting, colourful dress, the others she can no longer recall.

Many of those involved in making the 
decision favoured the dress, but she says she was adamant that the tutu 
and T-shirt be used because the dress would date easily, while her 
favoured look would not.

It was 'logic, not fashion,' she said.

Mixed reactions: Sex and the City producer Darren Star was not keen on the ensemble, but Ms Field told how she and actress Sarah Jessica Parker insisted upon it

Named and famed: The 'Carrie' necklace, worn throughout the six seasons, was a find from Ms Field's East Village shop

Indeed,
though the Carrie Bradshaw character would become known for her 
designer wardrobe, Ms Field was careful to inject 'real' elements 
to her look, items that any style-loving New Yorker might stumble upon.

The
'Carrie necklace', that reappeared frequently throughout the six 
seasons, came from the costume designer's East Village shop, a popular 
haunt for students and twenty-somethings, but not, she felt, where 
label-loving Carrie might normally shop.

'That name necklace was something 
that black kids, Puerto Rican kids, borough kids, ethnic kids had been 
wearing forever, that was just a statement,' she said.

'I had one made up, with her name, and [Sarah Jessica] liked it, after all, it 
was a piece of New York, a real piece of New York, and it wasn't just Manhattan it 
was from outside Manhattan from the other parts of New York where the people 
live.

'Somebody like Carrie, living in New York, would have caught it 
somewhere, and seen it on somebody, and liked it, so it had that reason 
for being.'
