Alex Heriot, 19, collapsed at the RockNess festival

The devastated family of a teenager who collapsed and died at a music festival after apparently taking a 'legal high' have warned about the dangers of taking drugs.

The grieving family of Alex Herriot described the 19-year-old as a 'happy, caring and kind young man' after he collapsed at the RockNess festival in Scotland.

Mr Herriot, from Portobello in Edinburgh, is thought to have experimented with a legal drug called Benzo Fury at the festival, on the shores of Loch News at Dores in the Highlands.

The 19-year-old collapsed in the main area on Saturday night and died in hospital a short time later. His relatives say he was not a habitual user of drugs and had been warned to steer clear of them.

They spoke of their devastation at the loss of an 'immensely popular' young man, saying they would never get over his death.

In a statement issued through Northern Constabulary, the family said: 'Alex, our much loved son, was happy, caring, kind, loyal and affectionate and joined in enthusiastically with any project. He was very popular with a large group of close, good friends.

'He was beautiful both on the outside and the inside where it matters most. He loved his life.

'The fact that we will not be seeing him wandering around the house with his laptop playing his music, teasing his sister and asking if there was any food and 'could he have a bus fare please' is unbearable.

'Alex was attending a music festival which he had been looking forward to enormously. As a young man who enjoyed life, it was unfortunate he chose to experiment with a drug that had such a catastrophic effect on his system.

'We are devastated that we have lost him but anything he did, in every area of his life, was done with good intent, in this case to get the most out of his festival experience.'

Mr Herriot had almost completed an HND in media studies and planned to go to Edinburgh's Queen Margaret University. He was said to have enjoyed film, anime, comedy and music.

Thanking the police and the medics who tried to save his life, the family said: 'The sudden death of our beloved son Alex has left his family in a state of shock and is a loss we will never get over.

On Thursday, the teenager, had written on his Twitter profile page about how much he was looking forward to the Scottish music festival

Festival: More than 30,000 people attended the weekend event and police said 144 revellers had been arrested over drug possession and one for dealing

Friends: Hours later, a 19-year-old woman and 20-year-old man, believed to be friends of the dead teenager, were taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness

‘Legal highs’ are substances which produce the same, or similar effects, to drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, but are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act. 

There are a large number of 'legal highs' - some are known by their brand/product name, such as Benzo Fury and it's not always clear what's in these products and their contents can change regularly.

Benzo Fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high.

It induces feelings of empathy similar to Class  A drug ecstasy.

Benzo Fury is also a stimulant and it's side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia.

Controversial 'legal highs' such as Benzo Fury and Ivory Wave are manufactured in laboratories in the Far East and eastern Europe.

They have become a popular alternative to illegal ecstasy and Meow Meow..

'He was a very special person, always
in a good mood, funny, interested in everything around him, immensely 
popular and loved by everyone who knew him.

'He had everything going for 
him: personality in abundance, very good, close friends, a large 
extended family unit that supported and adored him; and we are all 
devastated by our loss.'

In a warning to other youngsters, 
they said: 'Alex was not a habitual drug user. We know that young people
dabble in drugs and Alex had been warned to steer clear. Please, please
be aware that certain drugs can kill and please don't be the next 
youngster to leave their family bereft.'

Mr Herriot died in the early hours of Sunday morning at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, failing to respond to treatment.

Police said over the weekend that early indications show that he may have taken drugs.

Officers said a 19-year-old girl and a
20-year-old man were also taken to hospital from the festival in the 
early hours of Sunday morning. They are thought to have taken drugs, 
including so-called legal highs.

The man and woman are described as being in a ‘comfortable’ condition.

Northern
Constabulary confirmed Mr Heriot’s death is believed to be drug-related
but would not say whether he had taken Benzo Fury.

Toxicology tests are being carried out to discover what substance or mixture, if any, was involved.

Benzo Fury can be bought wholesale over the internet and usually sells for £10 a pill, or £25 for three.

Mr Heriot's father told the Daily 
Record: 'We are still talking to the police liaison people and we are 
not sure of the full circumstances of what has happened.

'We are still struggling to take it in.'

On Thursday, the teenager, who was 
studying at Jewel and Esk College in Dalkeith, Midlothian, had written 
on his Twitter webpage about how much he was looking forward to the 
festival, headlined by acts including Mumford & Sons.

He wrote: ‘To say I am excited for RockNess 2012 is an absolute understatement.’

Legal highs defeat sniffer dogs which are not trained to detect legal substances and so far no other Benzo Fury has been found.

Police
and organisers minimised the risk of controlled drugs at the festival 
through measures, including searches and the use of drugs dogs as well 
as amnesty bins.

Event
commander, Superintendent Stevie Mackay, said: 'Taking drugs or any 
medicines, which you have not been prescribed, is an extremely risky 
thing to do.

'If anyone has the tablets described or any other drug, whether controlled or a 'legal high', in their possession, they are advised not to take them and to hand these in.

'Amnesty bins are available at the main Nesstival entrance or anyone can hand in substances to Crew 2000 at the welfare tent.'

Legal high deaths: Hester Stewart's body, left, was found next to a bottle of GBL in a house in Brighton after a party while Lois Waters, right 24, is believed to have taken party drug mephedrone - known as meow meow - in the lead up to her death

In recent years there have been 
several highly publicised cases of young people dying after taking drugs
which were legal highs.

Hester Stewart's body, 21, was found next to a bottle of GBL in a house in 
Brighton after a party in 2009, while Lois Waters, 24, is 
believed to have taken party drug mephedrone - known as meow meow - in 
the lead up to her death in 2009.

Both
substances are now banned, but health professionals and police fear 
each time a drug is outlawed, a new alternative is introduced on to the 
market.

It is also a stimulant and its side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia.
