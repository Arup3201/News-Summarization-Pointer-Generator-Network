Rush-hour commuters might have been forgiven for thinking that the audacious armed ambush of a prison van was part of a scene for a television crime drama – but it was all too real.

They watched in horror as a car was driven across a busy road into the side of the van, forcing it to a halt.

Three men wearing balaclavas leapt out of the car and a guard on the armoured GEOAmey van was threatened with a sawn-off shotgun as the men smashed the van’s windows with axes and sledgehammers.

 into with a sawn-off shotgun and police admitted both men 'represent a
 risk to the community'

Investigation: The GEOAmey prison van was on Regent Road with its side door open and glass all over the road

Dangerous: Police warn that 20-year-old Ryan McDonald, of Salford, is still at large and should not be approached

Two prisoners jumped out and all five 
men ran to the green Saab and drove off. It was quickly abandoned on a 
side street, and two men sped off on a motorbike, while the others ran 
into the Ordsall council estate in Salford.

A witness said: ‘I saw a dark green 
car with three men in it. They had balaclavas. I thought it was a bit 
strange and kept looking back to see what the car was doing. Then I saw 
the car pull across the road straight into the side of the Transit van 
and the men smashed the windscreens.

‘I kept walking and called the police 
and I could hear the smashing of screens. I looked back because I’d 
heard some more shouts and there were some men running towards me, so I 
just sprinted as fast I could into the estate. I was pretty scared.’

Last night, police were hunting Steve 
McMullen, 31, and Ryan MacDonald, 20, who were being taken to nearby 
Manchester Crown Court. They warned members of the public not to 
approach them.

McMullen was on trial for conspiracies
 to kidnap, rob, commit arson and possess a firearm. MacDonald was due 
to be sentenced after admitting conspiracy to commit robbery.

The men were being transported from 
HMP Altcourse, Britain’s first privately financed prison, which is run 
by G4S, the firm behind the Olympic Games security fiasco.

One of the men had been apparently 
using a mobile phone to post messages on his Facebook page in recent 
weeks. A Prison Service source said a call or a text could have been 
sent to alert the ambushers.

A spokesman for GEOAmey, the prisoner 
transport firm, said: ‘We are liaising with Greater Manchester Police.’ 
Last night, a woman, 28, and a man, 24, were arrested on the Ordsall 
estate on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender.

They remain in police custody for questioning.

Police have warned they are 'a 
risk to the community' and were dubbed the 'most wanted men in Britain' as a major manhunt got underway.

McDonald, from Salford, was charged in January after a
stolen Volkswagen Polo he was in was chased and cornered by police following a gangland
shooting which left a 20-year old man injured. 

On his Facebook page McDonald appeared to have posted
pictures of himself larking about with other inmates at Hindley Young Offender
Institution and flexing his muscles for the cameras.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing a green 
car drive across the carriageway of the road before smashing into the 
side of the white van, before a group of men ran into the nearby Ordsall
 estate.

One said: ‘I crossed the road and saw a
 dark green car with three men in it. They had balaclavas on. I thought 
it was a bit strange and walked past and kept looking back to see what 
the car was doing.

‘I then saw it pull across the road 
straight into the side of the transit van and (the men) smashed the 
windscreens. I kept walking and called the police and I could hear the 
smashing of screens.

‘I looked back because I'd heard some 
more shouts and there were some men running towards me so I just 
sprinted as fast I could into the estate. I was pretty scared, to be 
honest.’

About 150 yards further along the 
road, on the opposite carriageway, a dark-green Saab had been abandoned 
in the road, surrounded by a police van and a police car.

Both the prison van and the Saab were 
cordoned off by police tape while officers searched the area for clues. A
 police helicopter called India 99 could be seen hovering overhead.

Abandoned: Police were searching the SAAB car believed to have been used during the attack in Salford

There was a huge police presence in 
the area around Salford, including police dogs, as the hunt continued 
for the men who it is believed have been sprung from the van.

A Prison Service source suggested the 
ambush would probably involve one of the escapees having access to a 
smuggled mobile phone - of high value inside jail with inmates banned 
from having them.

A phone call could then be made or a 
text sent to let the armed gang know which prison van they were in and 
so which vehicle to target, among the many vans making their way from 
jail to court.

The ambushed van which has CCTV was 
operated by prisoner escort firm GEOAmey and was on its way to a court 
from privately-run HMP Altcourse.

Altcourse is run by G4S, the firm 
behind the Olympics security fiasco, and was the first designed, 
constructed, managed and financed private prison in the UK.

The Category B jail takes young 
offenders and adult male prisoners either sentenced or on remand from 
courts in Merseyside, Cheshire and North Wales and can hold up to 1,324 
prisoners.

Response: Two inmates escaped after a prison van was attacked on a road in Salford, Greater Manchester

Location: The street is a main road into Manchester is around half a mile from the city's crown court

Attack: Shortly after 9am, police were called to Regent Road (file picture) in Salford, Greater Manchester

Two years ago: The rush-hour raid took place just off the same stretch of road as a similar attack on a prison van in July 2011, which saw Liverpool gangsters Tony Downes (left) and Kirk Bradley (right) escape

'It's very concerning, obviously,' Chief Supt Mulligan told reporters. 'We have got a major investigation in place, we've got increased police presence in the area and a major investigation is ongoing to recover these people back into custody and also find those responsible for the offences.'

The street is a main road into 
Manchester and around half a mile from the city's crown court. The 
rush-hour raid was also just off the same stretch of road as a similar 
attack on a prison van.

Liverpool gangsters Tony Downes and 
Kirk Bradley escaped in the ambush in July 2011 as they were being taken
 from Strangeways jail to their trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
