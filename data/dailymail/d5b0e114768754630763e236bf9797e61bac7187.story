A man said he was 'nearly sick' after he found a live maggot in a cereal bar.

Nick Todd, 22, from London, only discovered the  worm after taking a bite out of the Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bar yesterday morning.

The horrified project coordinator, who had bought the cereal bar from a supermarket on his way to work, said: 'It was sitting there on top of the bar, wriggling around a bit.

'I can't believe there was something in there, let alone that it was still alive. I was nearly sick.'

Kellogg's has now pledged to carry out a full investigation into how the maggot was able to get into the food.

'Luckily I had only taken a tiny nibble from the corner before I noticed it, but it was quite well camouflaged so it was lucky I was paying attention.

'It doesn't go out of date until next year and I don't how the maggot managed to survive when the packet is supposed to be air tight.'

Mr Todd bought the cereal bar from a supermarket on Wednesday with the intention of eating it for breakfast that day. He now says the experience has put him off Kellogg's products for life.

'I'm really disappointed and don't think I'll be eating any of their products again.' 

Nick said he felt 'horrified' and 'disappointed' by the discovery which had put him off Kellog's products for life

He found the maggot still alive covered in a film on top of the bar.

Mr Todd said: 'It looked normal on the inside but I'm a bit concerned I've eaten some eggs or something. I hope my stomach acid will kill them if I have.

'The creature looks like it's shed a skin while it's been in there so it might even be a caterpillar, but whatever it is I'm horrified.

'Kellogg's is such a huge company you just don't expect this kind of thing from them. I've reported it to consumer services so hopefully they'll do something to put it right.'

'I'm really disappointed and don't think I'll be eating any of their products again.'

A Kellogg's spokesperson said they were conducting a full and thorough investigation but added it was 'extremely unlikely' the maggot entered the cereal bar in the factory 'because of the high temperatures involved in the production process.'

'We take all complaints of this nature very seriously,' she said. 'This was reported to us yesterday and when we receive the specimen we will carry out a full and thorough investigation.' 

Kellogg's have now pledged to conduct a full and thorough investigation but said it was 'extremely unlikely' it had entered the bar at their factory
