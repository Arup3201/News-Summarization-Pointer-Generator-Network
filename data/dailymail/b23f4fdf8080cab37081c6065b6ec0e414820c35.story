With her wedding fast approaching, Kim Kardashian made sure she didn't miss out on any beauty treatments when she and her family spent a week at a luxury beach resort in Thailand - so she made sure her room had its own private spa.

The reality TV queen, set to tie the knot with Kanye West on 24 May, stayed at the Iniala Beach House resort in Phuket, Thailand.

‘Each villa the Kardashian family stayed 
in at Iniala has its own spa, with six hours of treatments every day,’ a hotel source told Mail Online.

Iniala is a ten-suite private residence situated on Natai Beach just 20 minutes north of Phuket Airport.

Guests have their own personal spas inside their villas, which have incredible views of the beach and the Andaman Sea.

The Kardashians were pictured there almost every day of their stay.

The
 lavish spa at the £48,000 per week hotel had a full list of massage, 
facial, body treatments and nail care on offer to Kim and her family.

They include a 60-minute hand massage,
 90-minute cold mask facial, lotus blossom wrap, white mud wrap, hot 
stone massage and deluxe manicures and pedicures.

And, apparently, that’s not all Kim was doing to prep herself for her upcoming nuptials.

According to Grazia, Kim also had ‘butt, face and breast slapping’ to look her firmest and finest for her wedding day.

The bizarre Thai treatment involves being slapped by a masseuse over these areas of your body and claims to reduce wrinkles, tighten pores and give a more youthful complexion.

Tata Massage in San Francisco offers the treatment as a natural alternative to chemical skin firming treatments like Botox.

However some experts are sceptical about its supposed benefits.

'This slapping technique doesn't have any scientific base,' says Dr Mica Engel at London-based non-surgical skin clinic, Waterhouse Young.

'The technique has similarities to tapotement, a technique of rhythmic tapping on the body used in Swedish massage.

'But it's unlikely that any long term results can be achieved from that alone.

'Swelling and increased blood flow are normal reactions, but they do not last.'

It is unclear where Kim had the procedure, as Iniala Beach House confirmed to Mail Online that the hotel does not offer the treatment.
