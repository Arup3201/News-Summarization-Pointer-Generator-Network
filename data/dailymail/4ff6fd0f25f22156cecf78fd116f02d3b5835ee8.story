An activist attacked a group of libertarian students protesting outside a Hillary Clinton event at Oakland University by attempting to lick them and claiming that he had Ebola.

Larry Mitchell, 63, walked up to a group last Thursday afternoon and after a scuffle said he just returned from Texas with Ebola and was going to spread the deadly disease to them.

Mitchell, a member of the St. Clair Shores Democratic Club, had taken issue with the students' protests, who he called 'fascists'. He also said their political beliefs were to blame for the spread of Ebola.

He later admitted to Campus Reform, which posted a video on the incident, that he doesn't have the disease.

Clinton spoke on Thursday at a Democratic rally at the university to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.

A group of around 25 conservative students protested the event, although campus police and the Secret Service had kept them far away from the people lining up to get into the event.

'I just came from Texas, I have Ebola, and now I’m going to give it to you,' Mitchell can be heard saying during the video footage.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at a rally for U.S. Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer at Oakland University in Michigan on Thursday

According to witnesses, Mitchell licked his hand and then tried to wipe his saliva on the students.

'Without a public health system, we are going to have the spread of Ebola,' Mitchell told them. 'Libertarians don’t want a public health system so you’re a fascist.'

David Rowe, a senior political science student at Oakland, and one of the people attacked by Mitchell, told Campus Reform that he filed charges with Oakland’s campus police. 

He alleges that Mitchell lunged at him and grabbed his throat as well as licked his hand.  

An investigation into the incident is ongoing, according to police.
