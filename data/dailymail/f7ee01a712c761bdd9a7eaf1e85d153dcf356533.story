Paul Ryan announced Monday he won't be running for president in 2016, while both Mitt Romney and Chris Christie continued to inch closer to throwing their hats into the ring.   

Ryan, a nine-term Wisconsin congressman and the Republican Party's last vice presidential nominee on Romney's ticket, thanked those who encouraged him to seek the presidency, but said he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

'After giving it a lot of thought, I’ve decided not to run for president,' Ryan said in a press release. 'Our work at the House Ways and Means Committee over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward, and my job as Chairman deserves undivided attention.

'It’s clear our country needs a change in direction. And our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative. So I’m going to do what I can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory.'.

Ryan was among those Romney, his running mate in 2012, personally telephoned over the weekend to gauge their support for a third campaign.

Romney's possible 2016 campaign was barely on the horizon at this time last week and would be the first return engagement of a losing major party nominee in decades.

'It is no secret that I have always thought Mitt would make a great president,' he told NBC News. 'As for his plans for 2016, I don't know what he is ultimately going to do and the last thing I want to do is get ahead of his own decision making process.'

Asked by AP Monday if he would back another Romney bid for the White House, Ryan, 44, demurred, saying, 'It's premature for any of that.'

The former Massachusetts governor shocked former staff, supporters and donors on Friday when he told a private gathering in New York that he is again seriously exploring a campaign, a change for Romney after several months of insisting his career in politics had comes to its end.

The next day, he and his wife, Ann, began reaching out to others as members of their inner circle started to revive a political operation that had begun to move on.

'We had a great conversation. He made it clear to me he is seriously considering the race,' said Jim Merrill, a top Romney staffer in New Hampshire during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns. 'When you get a phone call like that at close to 9 on a Saturday night, it means something.'

Calls from Romney also went to several boldface names in Republican politics, including Ryan; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and the state's former governor, John Sununu; former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who ran for president in 2012; Meg Whitman, chief executive at Hewlett-Packard Co.; Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz; two former senators, Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Jim Talent of Missouri; and David Kochel, Romney's senior Iowa strategist in both of his previous campaigns.

Third time's the charm? Mitt Romney is reaching out to former staff and supporters as he considers a third run for president. Romney and his wife, Ann, phoned former backers in the early voting states over the weekend

Ally: Asked if he would back another Romney bid for the White House, his former running mate Ryan said it was too early to tell 

Said former New Hampshire volunteer Chris Wolfe, who backed Romney's first two bids, 'All we're really waiting for is somebody to pull the trigger and say, "We're in."'

Former aides suggested Monday that Romney could easily become a force in the coming contest, pointing to the more than $1billion he raised and 60 million votes he garnered in the last election. 

Yet he would face far greater challenges in the next presidential contest than he did in the last, particularly in the early primaries against a crowded field expected to feature more than a dozen Republicans with legitimate White House resumes, including several sitting governors and US senators.

None threatens Romney's prospects more than former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who has already begun to draw from the same pool of Republican donors who fueled Romney's last campaign.

Bush has yet to formally launch a campaign, but has been among the most aggressive would-be candidates in recent weeks, having launched a fundraising operation and attended a series of private meetings with donors across the country.

Romney could also face another establishment favorite, New Jersey Governor Christie, who is sending new signals that an announcement about his presidential plans could be imminent.

The Republican National Committee's top fundraiser, Texas-based Ray Washburne, is preparing to join Christie's team. He told the AP Monday, 'I won't be the national finance chairman at the end of the week.'

He declined to comment further because Christie has yet to announce his 2016 intentions.

Washburne was a leading fundraiser for Bush's brother, former President George W. Bush.

Christie's team is expected to start making moves to raise money for a prospective presidential campaign by the end of the month, according to a person who has been in touch with Christie's team, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly.

That could include the potential formation of a political action committee to begin raising cash that can be used to support a prospective campaign, the person said.

Christie's chief political adviser, Mike DuHaime, declined to comment.

Meanwhile, a handful of other prospective presidential contenders were preparing Monday to appear later this week at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego. 

The agenda includes former neurosurgeon and conservative favorite Ben Carson, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and outgoing Texas Governor Rick Perry.

The summit will take place close to Romney's southern California home. A spokesman did not immediately respond when asked if Romney or his representatives would attend the meeting.

In New Hampshire on Monday, former three-term New York Governor George Pataki capped a two-day trip to the early voting state sounding very much like a politician ready to jump into the race. 

He told the AP in an interview he's again considering a White House campaign because the nation can't risk electing another Democratic president.

'That's one of the reasons I think the outcome of this election is so important, and I'm so much more inclined to get involved,' Pataki said.
