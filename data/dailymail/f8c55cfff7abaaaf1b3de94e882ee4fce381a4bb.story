Bill Nye, the Science Guy, has taken issue with Patriots coach Bill Belichick's explanation for 'Deflategate.'

Belichick said at a press conference on Saturday that a sudden change in temperature or rubbing the footballs could be behind why balls used in the Patriots' AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts that paved the way for his team to reach the superbowl were under-inflated. 

But Nye, who used to host a popular science kids show, disputed that theory on Good Morning America yesterday. 

'I don't think you can change the pressure (like that),' Nye said. To really change the pressure you would need to use an inflation needle, he said.  'What he said didn't make any sense,' said Nye.

That's not how it works! Bill Nye the Science Guy (left) called out Patriots coach Bill Belichick (right) for his 'nonsensical' theory for why the teams game balls were deflated below NFL standard 

Allegations: The Patriots and Tom Brady had been accused of deflating their game balls for the January 18 game against the Indianapolis Colts (picture of Brady throwing a ball during the semifinal game above)

Still, Nye is a fan of the Seahawks - the team that the Patriots will play in the Super Bowl.

'I cannot help but say 'Go Seahawks!' Nye said.

Coach Belichick went into detail during his impromptu press conference, saying that the team conducted an internal investigation in which they simulated how their balls were stored and treated that showed how the PSI changed from when they were measured for air pressure before the game to after they came off the field.

And earlier this week Martin Schmaltz, a Professor of Physics at Boston University had said; 'If they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount, and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower, that would drop the PSI by between 1 and 2. 

Meanwhile on Friday afternoon, the NFL broke their silence on the issue.

In a statement, the league said; 'Our office has been conducting an investigation as to whether the footballs used in last Sunday’s AFC Championship Game complied with the specifications that are set forth in the playing rules.'

Among other things, the league said they had conducted over 40 interviews, been reviewing video footage and even hired a forensics team to figure out what happened on Sunday.

While Patriots coach Belichick has been speaking out about his theories on 'deflategate' his quarterback Tom Brady also denied to the press of having any part in deflategate or altering balls.

Response: Brady has denied deliberately deflating the balls as the NFL continues their investigation

The allegations of cheating using deflated balls and the accompanying press conferences are proving to be rich pickings for US comedians.

Saturday Night Live's opening sketch featured coach Bellichick - played by Beck Bennett - giving a flat denial at a 'press conference' of any involvement in the unfolding scandal.

Bennett opened his 'conference' saying: 'I have absolutely nothing to do with deflating those footballs.

'I'd like to spend the remainder of the press conference throwing my quarterback under the bus.'

In case the implication wasn't clear enough, he then said of Tom Brady: 'I love him like a son, just more of an estranged son that I wouldn't trust around footballs.'

'Brady', played by Taran Killam, then took the stage and played comically dumb about the allegations - describing the much-discussed science of ball pressure as 'nerd stuff'.
