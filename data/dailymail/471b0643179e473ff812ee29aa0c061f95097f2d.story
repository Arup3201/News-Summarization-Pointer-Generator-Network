Duggy the parrot has got herself in a flap - because she thinks she is a chicken.

The confused parrot started impersonating the farmyard animal after hearing the noise on a children's cartoon shown on TV.

But the two-year-old African grey soon became so obsessed with clucking that she ditched her cawing entirely.

Now Duggy spends all day long pretending to be a chicken - much to the delight of her owners.

Who's a clever boy: Duggy the parrot began impersonating chickens from a children's TV show - and not cannot stop clucking

Michelle Lamond, 47, from Seafield, West Lothian, said: 'She does it all the time now. She's a chicken now from morning until night.

'I think she's hilarious. My family think the same. They just laugh at her.'

The strange noises began after Ms Lamond left on the TV  o keep Duggy amused while she was out. Hours later, she came home to find the bird clucking away.

She said: 'I just came down the other day and she was going on like a chicken, I was like "Oh my God where did that come from?"

'Then I realised it came from the telly. If I go out during the day, I either put the radio or the TV on so there is always some background noise.

'I put on Baby TV and it's obviously came from that. I don't know what programme it was but I know it came from Baby TV.' 

Not so bird-brained: The two-year old African grey, from West Lothian, also tries to bark like a dog and likes to sing along to Colonel Bogey

The multi-talented parrot also whistles Colonel Bogey and even tries her hand at being a barking dog, according to her owners. 

Ms Lamond, who has owned Duggy since she was a chick, said: 'Her first couple of outbursts in the morning are loud. She likes to let you know she's awake.

'She also whistles away to the Colonel Bogey song. She really keeps us amused. She can also whine like our Dalmatian Cal and I'm sure the bark will come.

'The dog is five months and its quite fun to watch the two of them together. It's a madhouse.

'I actually came down the other day and wondered whether it was the dog or her whining, and it was her.

'She makes various noises. She'll say "I love you" and "Hello Duggy" and she sings songs here and there. She's quite a tame parrot. She'll take food out your hand.

'If you have something and she wants it, she'll fly on to the plate and try get a bit. She can fly onto you and try steal your food.'

Huband Kenneth, 50, added: 'The only thing we can think of is that she picked it up from the cartoons in the morning on the television.'
