A police officer has been placed on administrative leave after writing on Facebook that the Ferguson, Missouri cop who shot dead an unarmed black teenager last month 'did society a favor'.

Jason Lentz, a 17-year veteran of the Elgin Police Department in Illinois, is under investigation after colleagues discovered he had written multiple racially-charged Facebook posts. Details of his posts have now been released to the Courier-News following a Freedom of Information request.

His suspension - the fourth in his career - comes after Ferguson cop Darren Wilson gunned down 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9, sparking clashes between police officers and protesters.

In one online post on his personal Facebook page on August 17, Lentz posted a photo of Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson - who is black - with a black man and making an 'OK' hand sign.

'He is also in the Chicago Tribune hugging protesters. Just awesome… appears to be the enemy within,' Lentz wrote.

The post about Brown was made on August 15 above a video he shared entitled: 'Police Released surveillance footage allegedly showing Michael Brown stealing cigars befor[e].'

He wrote: 'Hmmm … Innocent victim my ass. Did society a favor.'

The Courier-News reported that after the post was seen by supervisors, Lentz was told to remove it - but he did not and simply shortened the message to read: 'Hmmm...'

In total, 11 Facebook posts made over the past year were included in his file.

In one post, he called this highway patrol captain - who is pictured making an 'OK' sign - 'the enemy within'

Controversial: In a post from last November, he also agreed that if school children have Martin Luther King Day off from school, they should also be allowed to miss Veterans Day

Another included a photo of a letter a parent had written to a school, explaining that their child would not attend school on Veterans Day until students attend school on Martin Luther King Day.

Lentz wrote: 'Hell Yeah!!! I think next year I'll keep the kids home.'

He was placed on leave after another officer brought the posts to command staff's attention. Officials have said that the posts could violate the Police Department's social media guidelines.

The officer has previously served suspensions in 2001, 2012 and June, the Courier News reported.

Among these, in 2012, he was summoned to court to appear as a witness in a case about the rape of a 74-year-old woman in 2010.

But he failed to turn up, telling a supervisor and assistant states attorney that he was not able to attend because he was flying out for vacation.

Earlier this year, he was also accused of sending an email on the city system that included profanity. 

The investigation is expected to take a few weeks. Depending on the conclusion, he could return to work or face termination.

Other police officers have found themselves in hot water for their comments following the Ferguson incident. 

Glendale Officer Matthew Pappert lost his job  after he commented on his Facebook saying the protesters should be 'put down like rabid dogs'.

In another comment, he said: 'Where is a Muslim with a backpack when you need them?'

Pappert later apologized, saying he was 'deeply remorseful' for the comments.
