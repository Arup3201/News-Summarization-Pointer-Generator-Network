The family of a 12-year-old girl is trying to raise money so she can have surgery to remove a watermelon-sized tumour from her ovaries.

Brave Han Bingbing from Heilongaijang province in north eastern China was first diagnosed with ovarian teratoma in 2009.

Since then, her family have run up considerable debts trying to fund their daughter's medical bills for her ongoing treatment.

The youngster has suffered with the condition for the past five years defying the expectation of many doctors.

Several clinics refused to treat Ms Bingbing until her family found a hospital, 2,500 miles away in Gyangzhou, southern China.

Now, a charity is working alongside Ms Bingbing's family in order to raise enough money to finance the complex surgery.
