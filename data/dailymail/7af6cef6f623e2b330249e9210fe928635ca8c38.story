A girl of two escaped death by a millimetre when she fell on to a  pencil which lodged in her brain.

A startling X-ray shows the pencil penetrating Wren Bowell’s right eye and continuing one-and-a-half inches inside her head. Neurosurgeons operated for four hours to save her life, removing a section of her skull to take the pencil out.

They said that, astonishingly, the point of the pencil had not gone into her eyeball but had skirted the top of it, passing between the eyeball and the socket.

Remarkable: Wren, pictured with her mother Michelle, emerged unscathed with no brain damage and no ill-effects on her eye-sight after the pencil just missed two major blood vessels in her head

It also missed three major blood vessels, one by only a millimetre. Just a fraction further and it could have proved fatal.

Remarkably, she emerged unscathed with no brain damage and no ill effects on her eyesight.

Wren had been drawing in her bedroom 
and was running to show the pictures to her parents Martyn and Michelle 
when she tripped over a stairgate and the pencil she was holding went 
into her brain.

Mr Bowell, 34, a model maker, said: ‘A
broken bone would be bad enough, but something happening to the eye, 
head or brain is one of the worst things that could possibly go wrong.

‘Fortunately my wife, who is a nursery nurse, kept a level head and realised not to try to get the pencil out.’

An ambulance took Wren from her home 
in Peasedown St John, Bath, to the city’s Royal United Hospital. After a
scan showed the seriousness of the injury it was decided to transfer 
her to the specialist neurosurgeons at Frenchay Hospital near Bristol.

All
better: Wren Bowell with her parents Martyn and Michelle. The toddler 
had to spend three weeks in hospital with her family at her bedside

Consultant neurosurgeon Ian Pople, who
operated on Wren, said: ‘The pencil was within a millimetre of hitting a
big blood vessel in the brain. She was incredibly lucky as she came out
fortunately with no major bleeding.

‘It just skirted the top of the eye 
and that it didn’t damage the eyeball itself was very fortunate. She was
very lucky not to have suffered any permanent damage.’

Mr Pople said he had seen this type of
injury about three times in 16 years as a consultant neurosurgeon. ‘I 
have also known of a case, which I did not deal with myself, that was 
fatal,’ he said. ‘And another, which was not fatal but caused a lot of 
damage because it hit the blood vessel.’

He said that as well as removing part 
of Wren’s skull, it was also necessary to ensure no flecks from the 
pencil had remained inside the brain by using an antibiotic wash.

Wren’s father said: ‘They then put her skull back together with plastic plates and screws which will biodegrade.’

After the operation Wren spent three 
weeks in Frenchay with her family around her and was allowed home on 
April 4. She had to take anti-seizure drugs as a precaution but has been
fine.

Mr Bowell, who has signed up for a 
first aid course since the accident, is to take part in a sponsored 
cycle ride to raise money for more toys for Frenchay’s children’s unit.

‘I can’t thank the neurosurgeons enough for what they did and this is a way of giving a little bit back,’ he said.

‘The toys and games provided by the 
play team at Frenchay provided a distraction for Wren on a daily basis 
for those three and a half weeks. That kept her sane and therefore kept 
us sane.’
