If this 
truly is to be Alastair Cook’s last stand as England captain then he 
intends to stay true to himself and go down fighting when he takes on 
India in the decisive third Test at the Ageas Bowl.

For
 all his defiance and the full backing of the ECB, it is difficult to 
see how Cook could survive another defeat in Southampton, and a 2-0 
deficit in this Investec series with two to play, against a side who 
usually cannot win away.

To
 that end Cook, without a hundred in 27 innings, will summon the spirit 
of 2010 when his form was so bad that he just threw caution to the wind 
at The Oval and made a century against Pakistan that saved his 
international career.

Last chance saloon: Cook knows his side can't afford to lose the third Test in Southampton

‘I was in a lot worse place with my batting then,’ he said ahead of his date with captaincy destiny.

‘I
 couldn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. I was really, really 
struggling. So it just came down to an attitude of “f*** everything and 
go and hit the ball”. It seemed to work.’

Cook,
 who showed glimpses of regaining his touch at Lord’s before falling to 
his old failing outside  off-stump twice, is adamant that he is in far 
better shape now as he attempts to stop England’s new era crumbling 
around his feet.

‘For
 the past two or three weeks — and I know we’re just talking about nets —
 the ball has been  hitting the middle of the bat and going where I want
 it to,’ insisted Cook. ‘I feel as if I am moving well.

‘At
 Lord’s I felt I battled hard but got out to the two mistakes I made. To
 me it is not far away. My batting felt horrible four years ago and it 
doesn’t feel that way now. But I can’t keep saying that because people 
will laugh until I get results.’

Kevin
 Pietersen, who will haunt England’s attempts at rebuilding until they 
finally start winning again,  became the latest and most predictable 
former England captain to say that Cook should go.

‘For
 the past three or four weeks everyone’s been saying it so it’s no 
different who else says it,’ said Cook. ‘But, as I keep saying, I’m 
desperate to carry on. I love being England captain. It’s a huge honour.

‘I
 haven’t thought about resigning. I’ve just got to stay true to myself 
and tell myself how good it would be if I can get through this as a 
person and as a player and as a leader take huge strides from it.

'I
 said when I first took over that I want to throw everything into this 
and until that time when I don’t feel as though I can carry on, or 
someone taps me on the shoulder, that’s what I am going to carry on 
doing.’

Preparation: England practiced at the Ageas Bowl ahead of the crucial third Test against India

Netting: England captain Cook is without a century since May 2013 against New Zealand

It’s England’s worst losing run for 20 years and now they must surely win the third Test against India at Southampton to save Alastair Cook’s job.

The run of ten Tests without a win is their worst since 1992-93, when teams led by Graham Gooch, Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton lost nine out of ten matches. This time there has been only one captain but Cook and his teams have contrived to throw away promising positions in every game.v Australia The Oval, Aug 2013Bad light stopped play with England needing 21 runs from four overs to seal a 4-0 series win. But Cook’s side had lost the initiative on day three, when they scored at just 2.15 runs per over, and were only given a sniff of victory thanks to Michael Clarke’s generous final day declaration. Result: Drawv Australia Brisbane, Nov 2013Things could have been so different but for a 114-run stand betweenBrad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson after Australia had been 132-6 on day one. Johnson went on to score 64 and take nine wickets in the match as England slumped to their second biggest Ashes defeat in terms of runs.Result: Lost by 381 runsv Australia Adelaide, Dec 2013Australia were 174-4 on day onebut three dropped catches in the final session cost England. The last, by Michael Carberry, reprieved Haddin on seven. He went on to score 118 as Australia racked up 570 and Johnson blew England away.Result: Lost by 218 runsv Australia Perth, Dec 2013Haddin added 124 with Steve Smith to help Australia recover from 143-5 and post a score that proved enough against a fragile England who, despite a second-innings century from Ben Stokes, were doomed after being set 504 for victory.Result: Lost by 150 runsv Australia Melbourne, Dec 2013Leading by 137 with nine second-innings wickets in hand, England collapsed twice to throw away their advantage — first losing three wickets for one run, then five wickets for six. It left Australia chasing just 231 for victory.Result: Lost by eight wicketsv Australia Sydney, Jan 2014Another century stand between Haddin and Smith allowed Australia to recover from 97-5 to post 326 batting first. Cook’s team made 155 in reply, slumping to defeat in three days.Result: Lost by 281 runsv Sri Lanka Lord's. June 2014The tourists escaped defeat thanks to DRS after Nuwan Pradeep was reprieved when wrongly given out to Stuart Broad’s penultimate ball of the match. Yet England could have wrapped this game up earlier had they not allowed Sri Lanka to rally from 289 -4 to post 453 in their first innings.Result: Draw.v Sri Lanka Headingley, June 2014A 149-run stand from Sri Lanka captainAngelo Mathews and Rangana Herath, helped by Cook’s reluctance to attack Mathews, saw the tide turn. Chasing 350, England slumped to 57-5 and despite Moeen Ali’s ton, lost off penultimate ball.Result: Lost by 100 runsv India Trent Bridge, July 2014India were allowed to post a century stand for their final first-innings wicket. Even on day five, with the tourists six down and leading by 148, England had a decent chance of victory but their tiring bowlers could not force victory on a dead pitch.Result: Drawv India Lord’s, July 2014Despite bowling poorly on a made-to-order green top, England had India 145-7 on day one. But they put on 150 for their final three wickets and, after again being let off at 123-4 in the second innings, went on to win as Cook’s side imploded chasing 319 to win.Result: Lost by 95 runs

Cook
 knows that there is now almost a universal belief among his 
predecessors in the commentary boxes that he should step down, even 
though he has experience of leading England from 1-0 down against India 
to win a series.

‘I
 would much rather they said nice things about me,’ he admitted. ‘But 
they’ve all been through it and if you are not winning games and not 
scoring runs it goes with the territory.

'Does
 it affect me? I would rather they didn’t say it, but I am quite a 
strong-willed guy who does not take too much notice of the media.

‘I
 have got to make sure I am concentrating on myself over the next five 
days and not what people are thinking in the commentary box. Nothing 
will give me more satisfaction than if I do pull through this and score 
runs, because I know how much effort and blood, sweat and tears that 
have gone into it.’

Cook
 and Peter Moores, in desperate need of a victory himself in his second 
coming as coach, face a difficult decision over the make-up of a bowling
 attack that badly let the captain and side down in the embarrassing 
defeat at Lord’s.

The
 word is still that England want to bring both Chris Jordan and Chris 
Woakes into the side, as well as debutant Jos Buttler, but it is the 
question of who stands down that needs to be addressed.

MS
 Dhoni heaped more pressure on Jimmy Anderson ahead of his level three 
disciplinary hearing next Friday and England clearly need the leader of 
their attack to play — and play well — in Southampton as there is every 
chance he will be banned for the last two Tests at Old Trafford and The 
Oval.

Drill: England bowler Stuart Broad dives as he practices his fielding while Cook watches on

The
 suggestion earlier in the week was that Stuart Broad would be rested 
here to protect his damaged knee from the rigours of too big a workload,
 as he will be needed more than ever if Anderson is missing from the 
last two games.

Yet
 Broad has been passed fit and is clearly desperate to play on a pitch 
which should have bounce, pace and carry, leaving England to decide 
whether to go for broke here and back the senior bowlers who have let 
Cook down.

It
 would be harsh on Liam Plunkett if he proved to be the one who missed 
out but he was feeling a hamstring at Lord’s and would be needed in 
Manchester should Anderson be found guilty next week.

It
 is another headache for a side who have unravelled spectacularly since 
winning the Ashes last summer. The next five days will decide if there 
is to be another seismic shift within the ranks and a new captain is 
needed.
