A groom was left so traumatised after being kidnapped by 16 masked men in a terrifying stag-do prank he almost missed his wedding.

Ollie McAninch, 33, was so stressed by the ordeal he developed shingles and was told to avoid his fiance for a month, leaving his big day in doubt.

He was driving along a country lane with fiancee Clair Hart when the gang jumped out of the bushes and blocked his path.

Brandishing baseball bats and setting off stun grenades, they told him to 'get out of the f****** car, get on the floor!' and bundled him into the back of a van.

He was bound, gagged and dressed in a Guantanamo Bay-style jumpsuit.

Clair - who was in on the gag - pretended to be terrified as Ollie was driven off in fear of his life.

Ambushed: This is the moment a groom was kidnapped by a gang as part of an elaborate stag-do prank

Surrounded: They gang shouted 'get out of the f****** car, get on the floor!' as they pounced on their friend

He was transported more than 100 miles to the Devon countryside where he was stripped and told to wear a lime green Borat-style mankini.

Ollie was then handed a rusty bike and map and ordered to cycle ten miles before reaching the venue for his stag party - an outdoor activity 'boot camp' centre.

But the stress of the prank left Ollie suffering shingles - an illness often found in combat veterans.

Ollie, of Bath, Somerset, was so contagious he couldn't go near Clair for a month in the run up to the wedding.

Luckily he recovered in time and the pair tied the knot last Saturday in front of 130 guests.

Ollie said: 'I was absolutely terrified. We were stuck behind this van that had 'Turkish bailiff' printed on the back.

'Then all of a sudden, all these men dressed in black balaclavas burst out of the bushes and dragged me out of the car.

'They put me in handcuffs, slapped me around a bit and threw me into the back of the van.

'I have never been so scared in my entire life - I didn't know what was going to happen. I was petrified with fear.

'For more than two hours I was in that van - I had no idea what was going on, or where they were taking me.

'When I got the diagnosis my heart 
sank. They told me I would have to stay away from Clair until I got 
better and I was really worried I would miss the big day.'

The gang struck on a country lane outside Bath as Ollie headed out on what he thought was a day trip with Clair.

Elaborate: The gang, pictured driving their friend on a 100-mile journey, wore ski masks and balaclavas

It was the week before the planned date of his stag do - but unbeknown to him his stags had brought the date forward.

The prank was planned with 
military-style precision - including codenames and a 14-page plan for 
the 'elite strike team' on how to apprehend the 'target'.

Called 'Operation Haggis', the plan 
detailed a 'non-elite strike team to intercept and kidnap the subject 
and deliver safely to rendezvous point'.

The plan said: 'Balaclavas are to remain on for maximum effect and 'fear factor'

'Supersoakers and other non-'pro' equipment is to remain hidden in bags until the subject has been removed from his vehicle.

'Once subject is secured, he is to be 
dressed in an orange jumpsuit, restrained with handcuffs and 'bagged.' 
Subject will then be transported to Stag Party RV point.'

Ollie quivered in the back of the van for nearly two hours before his pals finally revealed it was a joke.

Organised: Another document detailing the code names and roles of members of the gang

But he then had to endure the humiliation of riding a bike into Exeter, Devon, on a busy Bank Holiday weekend.

He added: 'By the time I had worked 
out they were my friends, I still had to get into that ridiculous 
costume and cycle along busy roads on a bike that was barely fit for 
purpose.

'I've cycled to Spain and from Land's 
End to John O'Groats, but that was by far the most difficult ride of my 
life - I was still shaking so much.'

A week after the do Ollie began 
feeling sore and itchy - and was diagnosed with shingles, a skin and 
nerve disease commonly seen in combat veterans and brought on by stress.

He said: 'I have no doubt that fake kidnapping caused me to develop shingles.

'I'm usually such a calm and placid 
guy - but the stress of that ordeal was so much I thought I was going to
have a heart attack.

'The shingles was excruciating - Clair
never had chicken pox as a child, so I've been quarantined from her for
most of the last month because I was so contagious.

'We had to sleep in separate bedrooms.'

Happy ending! McAninch developed shingles due to stress and feared he would miss his wedding

A dish best served cold: The marketing consultant still invited his friends, but has vowed to seek 'vengeance'

All's well that ends well: Mr McAninch and his bride Clair Hart on their wedding day

But big-hearted Ollie still invited 
his pals to the wedding, despite their prank causing his illness - which
is a debilitating form of the chicken pox virus.

He said: 'It would have been hilarious if the joke was on anybody else apart from me. I've not forgiven my friends, I've just logged it for future vengeance.

'A few of them have their own weddings coming up, so I'm going to have to come up with something spectacular.

'I've got a really close group of 
friends who are always playing pranks on each other - I've dressed a 
mate up in a bondage suit and tied him to a lamppost in the middle of 
Newquay before.'

One of the organisers, electrician Kevin Harding, said: 'A lot of time and planning went into this.

'Ollie is a great guy, but we wanted to get him back for all the pranks he's pulled on us over the years.

'It was hilarious - he was so 
terrified he was about to shake out of his skin. We didn't mean to give 
him shingles, but it was worth it.'
