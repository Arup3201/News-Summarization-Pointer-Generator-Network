QPR are launching a bid to sign Lassana Diarra from Lokomotiv Moscow.

Diarra, 29, blossomed under manager Harry Redknapp while at Portsmouth and was part of the 2008 FA Cup winning side.

Redknapp had paid a bargain £5.5million to rescue him from Arsenal where he was struggling to make a breakthrough. Just a year later he sold Diarra to Real Madrid for £18.8m.

The France international was a favourite at the Bernabeu for his sharp tackling and willingness to play in different positions but, ultimately, was crowded out by their recruitment of galacticos and was sold to Anzhi Makhachkala before swiftly moving again to Lokomotiv.

Redknapp is eager to bring a quality defensive midfielder into his side to protect Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker. 

Diarra would cost around £6m but may be allowed to leave on loan if QPR pay his £80,000-a-week salary.

Napoli are also keen but Diarra has told them he would prefer to go back to London.

Redknapp wants four more signings, with a striker and left-back among his priorities. 

He has also enquired about Marseille midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, who is available for free and has an agreement in place with West Ham.
