Brian Smith is convinced his rookie London Irish wing, Alex Lewington, can scorch into England’s World Cup plans after his hat-trick against Saracens last week.

The 23-year-old showcased blistering pace and finishing class with his brilliant Aviva Premiership treble at the Madejski Stadium, despite the best efforts of the visitors’ fabled ‘wolf pack’ defence to stop him. Although the Exiles suffered an agonising 36-32 loss on Saturday, Lewington made a strong impression at a time when England are on the hunt for prolific wide-men.

Now, as he prepares for a return to Leicester, where he came through the ranks, Lewington has been identified by his director of rugby as a potential Test candidate, with Stuart Lancaster announcing his autumn squad on October 22.

Smith said: ‘There are a number of young fliers, like Lewi. Last year it was Marland (Yarde). Right now people are going “who’s hot?” If you’re a back three player your currency is speed and try-scoring. It’s early doors, but players like Lewington will emerge and put pressure on.’

Asked if a late run into contention for next year’s World Cup was still feasible, the former England attack coach added: ‘Yeah, definitely. If someone scores a dozen tries in the league, they’re going to be asking questions.

‘I’d say England are trying to work out what they want to do on the wing. Go back a year or two and they were playing an extra full-back, now I think they’re looking at out-and-out scorers.’

Lewington believes it is ‘too soon’ for any realistic hope of a call-up but he represented his country in the same Under 16, 18 and 19 teams as Owen Farrell and George Ford.

Lancaster certainly has several wing options to consider. In addition to Yarde, Chris Ashton and Jack Nowell, he will be keen to assess Christian Wade at Test level, if the turbo-charged Wasp can stay fit, while Jonny May was on the scoresheet for Gloucester last weekend. Another prime contender is Anthony Watson of Bath, but he is currently recovering from a foot injury.
