Netflix has announced that they will be postponing Bill Cosby's upcoming standup comedy special.

A spokesperson for the company said that Bill Cosby, 77, will be pushed back from its scheduled November 28 air date, this after several woman have come forward to allege that they were 'drugged and raped' by the actor.

The most recent woman to make this claim is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who says Cosby 'gave her a pill with wine' back during a dinner date in 1982, and that she 'remembers before [she] passed out that [she] had been sexually assaulted by [Cosby].'

Appearances by Cosby on popular television programs including Late Night With David Letterman and The Queen Latifah Show have also been cancelled as these new allegations come to light.

Cosby also cancelled a live appearance in Florence, Arizona, back on October 27 when Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she was 'drugged and raped' by Cosby as a teenager.

Earlier this week, Joan Tarshis also alleged that she was twice drugged and raped by the actor when she was 19-years-old.

Revealing her truth: 'He drugged and raped me,' said former actress Barbara Bowman of Cosby in an interview with MailOnline

The actor did however sit down for an interview with NPR Weekend Edition on Saturday with his wife, but grew silent and would not speak when host Scott Simon asked him about these allegations.

Cosby has in fact remained silent through this all, and his attorney, John P. Schmitt, issued a statement Sunday saying his client would not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response.

The 77-year-old Cosby was never criminally charged in any case, though he did settle a civil suit brought forward by a woman back in 2006.
