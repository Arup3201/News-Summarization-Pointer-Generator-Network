A body has been found in a Brisbane drain after a man went missing amid a severe storm that caused flash flooding and left 4000 homes without power. 

The police located the man's body at 6.30pm, after two hours of searching, 400 metres down a storm water drain in the Brisbane river near Eagle Street Pier.

The Courier Mail reported that the man was illegally kayaking in drains underneath the city with a female who called for help when the water began to drastically rise due to the storm around 4pm.

The storm ripped through the city and saw more than 80 millimetres of rainfall hit the South East

Queensland Police Regional Duty Officer Inspector Sean Cryer confirmed that the couple became trapped inside the tunnel after the storm hit.

'She managed to get to a place of safety for about an hour until the water had subsided,' he said.

The woman's partner was not so lucky.

The woman reportedly performed CPR on the man in the tunnel to no avail and fled the tunnel to alert police. 

Water police, rescue and fire crews were all involved in the search with inflatable boats used to search the tunnel.

'Slacks Creek had 80 millimetres and we had other places between 70 and 80 (millimetres) in the southern parts of Brisbane,' Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Michael Knepp told Sydney Morning Herald.

Slacks Creek is about 20 kilometres from where the man's body was found near Eagle Street Pier.

Flash floods occurred in Logan in Queensland's South East and 13 calls for assistance were received in the area.

Major delays were reported for various train lines as well as on the roads.
