Michael Owen won every domestic trophy on offer, but will be best remembered scoring goals for Liverpool

Owen, who won every domestic honour available during his time with Manchester United and Liverpool as well as the 2001 Ballon d'Or said: 'I am delighted to be selected to join the Hall of Fame. What a fantastic way to end my playing career.

'My whole family are very proud. It is great to be joining a list that includes so many of my heroes.'

The former England striker tweeted from the event to reveal he was sat at a table 'with legends Roger Hunt, Bobby Charlton, Jimmy McIlroy etc.'

Meanwhile Alan Shearer, who has scored a record 260 Premier League goals while playing for Southampton, Blackburn and Newcastle said ahead of the ceremony: 'It is a special honour to be recognised alongside so many greats of the game’s history. I am particularly pleased to be receiving my award in the same year as Hughie Gallacher.” 

There were also special awards to mark the centenary of the World War One Football Battalion, a group of players and fans who fought in the Battle of the Somme and to the 1880s 'Preston North End Invincibles', who were the first team to win the world’s first Football League competition after completing an unbeaten season.
