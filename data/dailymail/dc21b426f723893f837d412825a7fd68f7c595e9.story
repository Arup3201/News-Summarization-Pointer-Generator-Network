Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah has been criticised after posting a video online of himself tombstoning 100ft off a cliff.

The short clip, which appeared on Farah's facebook page, shows the athlete leaping the height of six double-decker buses into the sea off cliffs on a private island owned by Sir Richard Branson.

But Carole Biddlecombe, 57, whose son Nick was paralysed while tombstoning in 2000, has branded Farah irresponsible and urged others not to copy his actions.

Mo Farah has been branded irresponsible and a 'plonker' for posting a video of himself 'tombstoning' 100ft into the sea online

The Olympic gold medalist posted the clip online with the caption 'I miss Necker Island' - a Caribbean getaway owned by Sir Richard Branson

She said: 'If he wanted to do it on his own time then I can't stop him, but he shouldn't have made it public.

'He has a following of impressionable young people who are going to want to copy him. He's a plonker.

'My son is paralysed from the shoulders down. He can't do anything for himself or anyone else. To anyone watching that video and thinking about copying it, just don't do it. It's not worth it.'

Nick shattered three vertebrae in 2000 when he hit a submerged rock after jumping off cliffs on a beach near his Southampton home.

Then a keen footballer, Nick decided to take part after his friends began daring each other to jump into the sea from an old lifeboat slipway.

‘It was a case of proving who was the big man,’ he said at the time. ‘I was bet 50p and a cigarette that I wouldn’t jump in first, and I did.’

He has been in a wheelchair needing 24-hour care ever since.

It is not the first time Farah has put his life at risk in this way. He has previously admitted jumping naked off of Teddington Bridge and into the Thames as part of a dare with a friend.

Farah, a father-of-three, won the 5,000 and 10,000 meters gold medals at the London 2012 Olympics and has since been named an OBE in the Queen's honours list.

The 30-year-old is estimated to have made £10million from sponsorship deals since his win, includuing an advertising contract with Branson's Virgin Media.

The new high-altitude running track will allow Kenyan athletes to hone their skills ahead of the London Marathon in April
