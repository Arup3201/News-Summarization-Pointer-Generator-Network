The wife of Clarke Carlisle has praised her campaigning husband as the ex-footballer lies in a hospital bed following a road accident.

After  tweets about his work raising awareness of mental illness, Gemma Carlisle wrote: 'He's been helping others for too long he forgot to help himself.'

Her comments came as it emerged the 35-year-old ex-player is facing court action over an alleged drink driving offence for which he was charged just 36 hours before he was hit by a lorry.

The former Premier League star was seriously injured following the collision on the A64, near York, on December 22 and remains in a Leeds hospital.

The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that he was charged with failing to provide a sample on December 20 and is due to appear in court next month.

Mother-of-two Mrs Carlisle has used her Twitter account to thank fans for their support as her husband continues to receive treatment.

Shortly after the accident, she wrote: 'Don't normally use this account anymore. But have been overwhelmed with your thoughts and prayers. Thank you.

'Clarke's very poorly but he's alive and stable. Best Christmas gift we as a family could wish for. Thanks again.'

She added yesterday: 'Thank you for continuing messages of support and for media restraint. Clarke still very poorly but we're hopeful he'll make a full recovery.' 

She also tweeted other messages highlighting her husband's work around depression and with stroke victims.

After news of Carlisle's charges emerged this morning, former England international Kenny Samson told The Sun it was vital for Carlisle to get support and understanding from others in the game.

Samson said: 'I know what Clarke is going through at the moment and just how he is feeling. People shouldn't kick him while he's down.'

He added: 'It's not for others to judge him because they don't understand the battles he is facing. At the moment he needs everyone close to him to rally round and support him through this.'

A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: 'Clarke Carlisle, 35, was charged on Saturday, 20 December with failing to provide a specimen and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

'He is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2015.'

North Yorkshire Police launched an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and appealed for witnesses.

Since the collision, a host of footballers, former clubs, organisations and charities have used social media to send messages hoping former Professional Footballers' Association chairman Carlisle makes a quick recovery.

Over a 16-year career, Carlisle, who is also a former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs.

His most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division.

As a sign of the Clarets' support for their former player, fans at Turf Moor clapped in the fifth minute of their game against Liverpool on Boxing Day to match the squad number Carlisle wore at the club.

As well as Burnley, there have also been messages of support for Carlisle from the other clubs he played for, which include Blackpool, QPR, Leeds, Watford and Northampton.

The Football Association, Football League and anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, for which Carlisle is an ambassador, all tweeted their support as well, while representatives from the PFA visited him in hospital.

During his time in football and since retiring last year, Clarke Carlisle has campaigned to shed a light on what he has called the 'dark side of the beautiful game'.

He was once named 'Britain's cleverest footballer' and has appeared on the BBC's flagship political programme, Question Time, and quiz show Countdown.

In a TV documentary called Football's Suicide Secret he spoke to those working in the game about problems of depression and stress.

He said: 'Everybody's perception of being a footballer is that you've made it. You're a superstar. Football provides some magical highs, but it also provides some really, really dark lows.

'As a footballer, I've experienced all the ups and downs of the game, but there's one taboo no-one wants to talk about, mental illness.'

As part of his work highlighting racism and mental illness in football, Carlisle  appeared on Question Time

In the documentary, he spoke about his own attempt at suicide after he was injured early in his career.

He said: 'I thought "I'm going to take all these pills and kill myself because I'm of no use to anyone, because I know without football, they are going to see me for what I really am", and that was nothing.'

Carlisle, who is on the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association, used the programme to call on footballing authorities to do more to support players.

Carlisle has also campaigned against racism in the game and is an ambassador for the Kick It Out scheme.

As part of his work, he visits schools to speak to students and he has criticised Fifa president Sepp Blatter for claiming racism is no longer an issue in the game.

In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation who spoke to David Cameron to discuss issues of racism and homophobia in football.
