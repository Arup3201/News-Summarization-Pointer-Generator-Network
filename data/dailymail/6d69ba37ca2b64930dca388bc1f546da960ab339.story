'Hated': Riley Anapol was named in virgin killer Elliot Rodger's 141 page dossier despite not having seen him since he was six-years-old

A man who virgin killer Elliot Rodger said he hated in the warped 141-page manifesto he wrote just days before slaughtering six people, has told how he hadn't seen him for 15 years.

Riley Anapol, 21, said he was shocked to have been mentioned in document which crazed Rodger emailed to his parents and friends before going on a bloody rampage in Santa Barbara last weekend.

Mr Anapol said he does not remember Rodgers, who was in the same school as him for one year, and that the last time they met was when he was six-years-old.

Rodgers, 
whose bitter resentment of the world appears to have stemmed from the 
fact he was unable to attract women, said he resented Anapol who got '
lots of girls'.

He
 wrote: 'Early in my Third Grade year, my mother would often take us to a
 festival near Topanga Canyon Boulevard, wheresmall concerts were held 
and people barbequed great food.

'A
 friend of hers had something to do with these events, and I played with
 the son of this friend. He was named Riley Anapol, and he was two years
 younger than me. A First Grader. I played with some other younger kids 
there as well, peers of Riley, and I had a good time.

'Riley
 became a common friend for a while. The significance of this is that 
Riley Anapol would eventually become someone I would harbor a great 
hatred for.

'Riley
 would grow up to get lots of girls, and I would grow up to be rejected 
by girls. But back then he was a friend, a peer, and we were playing 
together as equals. It’s funny how the world works.'

But Mr Anapol, a politics student, said he had few memories of the time.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'It is tragic that he felt that there was any issues between us, because I truly didn't know him.

'We were very small and I don't even remember being his friend.'

Bitter: Elliot Rodger wrote a rambling 141 page 'manifesto' detailing his hatred of women shortly before slaughtering six people in a terrifying killing spree

The 141-page document, which the 22-year-old virgin emailed to his parents and friends before he killed six people on Friday last week, gives a terrifying insight into Rodger's hatred towards women for failing to pay him attention.

In one 
excerpt from last year, he wrote about getting beaten up after attending
 a party in Isla Vista just days before his 22nd birthday in one 'last 
ditch effort' to lose his virginity.

On
 Friday last week, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director 
Peter Rodger, killed six people before shooting himself dead.

Weihan
 Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both 
stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared 
with him. Investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in 
their sleep.

The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there.

Rodger then climbed into his car and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19.

Gesture: Mark Barden, who lost his son Daniel in the Newtown school shootings reached out to Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was gunned down by Elliot Rodger

He then got
 back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened fire. 
There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack that 
was captured on surveillance footage.

The
 gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at 
passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police 
officers returned fire and shot him in the hip.

He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars.

When police
 found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and 
nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally.

Earlier this week the father of a seven-year-old boy killed in the Newtown school shooting reached out to the father of Chris Michael-Martinez to say You're not alone.

Mark Barden has written a heart-wrenching open letter to Richard Martinez - offering his condolences and his support. 

'We have not met, but you are now part of our extended family,' Barden writes in a Facebook message.

'It is not a family we chose, but a family born from the horrible circumstance of losing a child to gun violence - one that’s only growing each day.'

Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was gunned down at a convenience store. He was planning to go to London this summer and had been aspiring to law school

Mr 
Martinez's son 20-year-old Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, a student
 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was killed Friday as he
 walked into a convenience store - one of three students shot dead by 
Rodger.

Mr
 Martinez has been a furiously outspoken since the day after his son's 
murder. In one speech he blamed the seven deaths on 'craven, 
irresponsible politicians and the NRA.'

On
 Tuesday, he brought 20,000 mourning college students to their feet with
 his chant 'Not One More' at a memorial service for the victims of 
Rodger's rampage.

Mark and his wife Jackie have been similarly outspoken since their son Daniel was gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.

They have appeared alongside President Barack Obama as he pushed for increasing gun control and background check restrictions.

They have also granted numerous media interviews - perhaps more than any other Newtown family - to talk about their son's legacy and to advocate for laws that they say could help prevent future mass shootings.

Police have said that Rodger was carrying three semi-automatic handguns that he purchased legally from a local gun shop.
