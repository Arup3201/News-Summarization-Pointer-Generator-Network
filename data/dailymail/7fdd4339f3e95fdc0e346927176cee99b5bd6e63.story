Oprah Winfrey's former personal chef Art Smith is set to open the first East Coast location of his popular Lyfe Kitchen chain in Manhattan later this month. 

The cooking expert, who worked with the TV host for ten years before later featuring as a celebrity chef on Bravo’s Top Chef Masters, is one of the company's two Executive Chefs and has helped to craft a menu which focuses on the health food chain's mantra: 'Eat Good. Feel Good. Do Good.'  

Each of the dishes on the menu are under 600 calories and contain less than 100mg of sodium, with many being made using fresh ingredients sourced from local vendors.

Lifelong friends: Since leaving her employ in 2007, Art Smith has remained close friends with Oprah Winfrey and regularly contributes recipes to her website 

After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2010, Chef Smith has focused much of his attention on creating healthy, balanced meals in the hopes of encouraging diabetics around the world to maintain a clean and simple diet. 

'It was important that I be a beacon for my family as well as for other people, to show them they could live well,' the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News last year.

'For me, it was working with my doctor to create an individualized diabetes management plan, which really helped me get back on track.'

Since his diagnosis, Chef Smith, who has also cooked for former Florida governor Jeb Bush and the Obamas, has done his best to avoid sugars and processed foods, ingredients which you won't find in any of Lyfe Kitchen's branches, which are also located in California, Colorado, Nevada, Illinois and Texas. 

'Our hope is that Lyfe Kitchen will be more than just another place to grab a bite,' the Lyfe website explains. 

'That it will be a place that reflects your values toward health, community and sustainability. And that maybe - just maybe - we’ll be a source of inspiration, too.'

Foodie fans: Oprah (L) is a well-known lover of food and employed Chef Smith as her personal chef for ten years

While he stopped working for Oprah in 2007, Chef Smith has remained close friends with his former employer - who has continued to show support for his work. 

The TV star features monthly recipes written by her former chef on her website, Oprah.com, and, in 2007, wrote a small piece about the launch of his first restaurant, Table Fifty-Two, which opened in Chicago.

'In all those years that Art was cooking for me, people would always say, "Oh, well, if I had my own chef, I would be thin, too,"' she wrote. 'Well, please. Art always used to cook so much food, I would say, "It's just Stedman and it's just me. My god, Art, you need a restaurant!"'
