A veteran Ravens cheerleader spoke out today about the team's decision to drop her from the Super Bowl squad because she had a 'rough year' - by gaining less than two pounds.

Courtney Lenz, 23, from Baltimore, Maryland, is the only cheerleader with more than three years of experience with her beloved team who will not be making the historic trip.

Thousands of Ravens fans have rallied behind Miss Lenz ahead of their championship game in New Orleans against the San Francisco 49ers.

Miss Lenz told MailOnline today: ' I feel as if it's a slap in the face.'

The 23-year-old has been a cheerleader with the Ravens since she was an 18-year-old freshman at Towson college, Baltimore.

She
 has posed for three team calendars and made dozens of appearances on 
behalf of the team since 2008.

Last year, she was chosen as one of eight
 cheerleaders from 40 to take part in charity work at the Children's 
Hospital in Florida where they fund-raised $2million.

This season, Miss Lenz, who is 5'4, was dropped from two games in October and November because of weight gain - of 1.6lbs.

She was told by Ravens staff to consult a nutritionist and get counseling at her own cost.

She
 said: 'During the season, I weigh 124lbs. At every practice, the 
trainer brings her scale and all the girls are taken aside, weighed and 
the number is recorded.

'I was told I was being benched because I had 
gained weight and when I asked how much it was, the scales showed 1.6lbs.'

'Devastated': Miss Lenz has left the cheerleading squad to focus on her marketing career after five years

Miss Lenz said: 'It's agonizing to know that you have gained weight. They really wanted me to lose more weight and be around 120/121lb. I was told: ''I don't care how you do it, just do it.''

'But I'm not going to do anything to my body and health that affects me in the future.'

The college graduate had planned to leave the squad at the end of the season to further her marketing career.

The Ravens' qualified for the Super 
Bowl after beating the New England Patriots on January 20.

Miss Lenz was among the fans
 who could not have been more excited, writing on Facebook: 'I'm still in shock!!! I can't believe 
I'm headed to New Orleans in two weeks!!! Couldn't be happier to be part
 of such an amazing team :) What an amazing way to end my cheerleading 
career!!! GO RAVENS ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!'

Last Wednesday, she received an email from the Ravens telling her that she had not made the cut for the Super Bowl squad and would not be among the 32 out of a possible 60 women traveling to New 
Orleans.

She said: 'When I asked for an explanation, they said I had ''a rough year and faced disciplinary action''. It was devastating.'

She then received another email on Sunday night asking her to hand in her Ravens uniform.

Miss Lenz said that she had spoken out about being dropped because she felt that what happened to her sent a negative message to young female fans.

'At the end of the day, it [the Ravens] is a business and they are going to tell you what they want you to do.

'I wanted to fight back and say something for other women who are too scared to speak out,' she explained.

The 23-year-old said that her mother has been incredibly supportive and that her boyfriend, whom she met at work, has been a 'rock'.

She added: 'He was a Redskins fan when we met but I converted him to the Ravens. Now he says I should forget about the Ravens and support the Redskins!'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Baltimore Ravens today.

Thousands of fans have rallied around Lenz, with a Facebook page trying to get the cheer squad to reverse its decision.

The petition has gathered more than 1,300 signatures and the Facebook page has been 'liked' by more than 4,770 users.

The petition reads: 'Courtney announced she was retiring 
during the last home game at the end of the season which didn't go well 
with the director [of the cheerleading program].

'She was told she didn't put in as many appearance hours this season as 
she did the past four years while in college. This season she earned her B.S. degree and got a full time job... Bad call.

Fans have launched a petition and a Facebook page online to try and get the cheer squad to reverse its decision

'They also stated she struggled with 
weight on occasion and she had been benched for [a] two-pound weight 
gain during a game earlier in the fall, which is absurd, unhealthy and a
 complete inaccurate measurement of a woman's "appearance" and size!'

The Ravens denied that her decision to retire had anything to do with their decision not to bring her to the Super Bowl.

'As
 set by the NFL, we are permitted to bring 32 cheerleaders to the Super 
Bowl,' spokeswoman Heather Harness, said in a statement.

'Our selection process was based upon three criteria: seniority, 
performance ability and personal conduct throughout the season.

'As much 
as we would like to take the whole team, we are unable to do so, due to 
parameters set by the NFL.'

'I'm so angry what they did to her my
 heart just isn't into [the Super Bowl game] as much as it was before,' 
52-year-old Debbie Kammerer of Pasadena, Md., said

'Sorry but that's the truth, the Ravens cheerleading organization has left a bad taste in all our mouths!'
