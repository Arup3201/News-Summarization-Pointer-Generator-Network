The humble daughter of a Scottish coal miner has been revealed as the designer behind the traditional royal christening gown, a replica of which will be worn by Prince George for his baptism.

Seamstress Janet Sutherland has been uncovered as the dressmaker who created the original lace and satin gown was worn by more than 60 royal babies, including Prince William 
himself.

The dress, created for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter Victoria, Princess Royal in 1841, was worn by every British monarch sinceÂ Edward VII, and yet little was known about the woman who created the famous item of clothing until now.

Spinster
Miss Sutherland, the daughter of a coalminer, Robert, started working 
for Queen Victoria when she was 34 and died in 1852 at the age of 45, according to The Sunday Times.

Her
brother William, also a miner, was famous in the family's home-town of 
Falkirk after he shook the Queen's hand when she visited Scotland after 
the christening.

Miss 
Sutherland was said to have designed the precious full-length white spitalfields gown to resemble the wedding 
dress worn by Victoria for her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg 
and Gotha in 1840.

of miner William Sutherland, pictured with his wife Rachel, designed the
royal Christening gown to echo Queen Victoria's wedding dress

The 
Queen was said to be so impressed with the cap-sleeved dress and its 
Honiton cotton lace overlay that she sent Miss Sutherland a plaque 
proclaiming 'Janet Sutherland, embroiderer to the Queen'.

However,
the tiny white gown, last worn by Lady Louise Windsor, daughter of the 
Earl and Countess of Wessex, in 2004, is now said to be incredibly 
fragile.

A replica of the 
frock was made by the Queen's dressmaker Angela Kelly and was first worn
by Lady Louise's younger brother James, Viscount Severn, in 2008.

Tradition: Prince William himself wore the original Victoria gown when he was christened on August 4, 1982

Family ties: Prince Charles wore the precious silk and lace gown when he was baptised at Buckingham Palace in December 1948

Regal: The Queen, pictured in the arms of her mother, was one of 60 royal babies to wear the precious gown when she was christened in 1926

The replica retains the same features
of the original, including the lengthy skirt and elaborate collar and 
bow, and since the christening of Viscount Severn has been worn by the 
daughters of Peter and Autumn Phillips, Savannah and Isla.

Prince George will wear the newer version of the gown for his christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on Wednesday.

His parents, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been determined that the service will be a private and intimate 
gathering of family and friends, with just 60 guests believed to be in 
attendance.

Legacy: Savannah Phillips, daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips, pictured at her christening in 2011, and her younger sister Isla were the last two children to wear the new gown, following Viscount Severn

The baptism will be presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.

The
Chapel Royal is a particularly poignant choice of venue for the couple 
as it was there that the coffin of Princess Diana was laid before her 
funeral in 1997.

Princess Beatrice was the last royal baby to be christened in the chapel at St James's Palace in December 1988.

Prince William was christened by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie, in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace.

Kensington Palace has declined to confirm any details about the christening, including the names of godparents and other guests.

Speculation that the godparents will be close friends of the couple, rather than dignitaries and foreign Royals has been rife.

Some
of the rumoured to be in contention include William's old friend Hugh 
van Cutsem, and Fergus Boyd, who lived with the couple at St Andrews 
University.

Prince George's godparents, whoever they may be, will be among guests at
an informal tea party thrown by William and Kate before the christening.

As well 
as family members,
university pals of the Royal couple and William's former RAF Search and
Rescue colleagues are set to be invited to the bash.

The event at Kensington Palace, to
take place before the formal ceremony on Wednesday, will give Kate and 
William the chance to mark the special occasion with those who will not 
be attending the service.

According to The Sun, china tea sets have been laid out in preparation for the party. described by the newspaper's source as 'very informal', along with toys for children of the guests to play with.
