Whether it’s his real name or not, only a man called Joe Gross could possibly upload this video.

Definitely not for the squeamish, it shows Mr ‘Gross’ removing what is quite possibly the world’s longest ingrown hair.

The video begins with ‘Gross’ claiming, maybe not for the first time, that this is the grossest thing he’s ever done. 

Joe Gross lines up the clump of ingrown hair on his neck with his tweezers 

After clamping the tweezers around the clump of hair he gives it a good tug 

‘I’ve had this giant black mark on my face for months and it literally looks like a pound of hair,’ he said. 

Then, using a pair of pink tweezers to make the whole procedure a little more stylish, he starts pulling the clump of black hair from his cheek. 

What goes on from here is pretty hard to stomach as Gross goes on to live up to his name and gets to work on removing the hair. 

There must be a lot of horror fans out there in cyberspace as the video has gone viral. During the disgusting drama Gross describes how he had a pimple which would ooze every couple of months for about a year. 

The hair comes out slowly in long strands that seem to take ages to come out

He finally pulls the last piece of hair out using the tweezers leaving only a hole and specks of blood  

A dermatologist made it clear to him that it was a cyst that would need to cut out, but as the hair just kept on being pulled out it ended up being just ‘the longest ingrown hair in history.’ 

Equally revolting was the moment a Canadian man last month squeezed a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years, and a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades was released. 

But 'Joe Gross' has grossed out everyone for now.
