The owner of a hotel in Scotland has turned to social media in the hope of tracking down a young couple who, he claims, left after a luxury Valentine's weekend without paying their bill.

Hotelier Jason Henderson took to Facebook to allege that the couple racked up a tab of £800 then left suddenly in a silver Audi.

Henderson is offering a two-night stay at the four-star Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Crieff, Perthshire, to anyone who can help him find the pair using a CCTV image he has shared online.

The mystery couple reportedly splashed out on fine food, flowers and wine - leading to a hefty £800 bill.

However, the furious hotel owner alleges they left early without settling up with the front desk.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, Knock Castle owner Jason Henderson said: 'It's disappointing and very upsetting that this has happened, myself and all the staff work so hard to sustain the business.

'To me it's not about the £750, £800, it's about highlighting what these people have done and making sure they don't do it again. It's a matter of principle.

'All we expect is people to pay their way, and I wouldn't like this to happen to anyone, whether they are our rivals in the market or not.

'I have been blown away by the support I have received by people who are all trying to help since I posted on Facebook; it's really pleasing.

'The police here are very effective, and I'm quite confident they will catch the two.'

Henderson, who has been running the hotel for seven years and takes on the roles of head chef, general manager and owner, revealed that the couple had enjoyed meals, snacks, champagne and flowers during a three-night stay.

He also believes the couple were 'from Scotland' and that they used fake ID when checking in.

The Facebook post by Knock Castle claims the couple used 'false' credit card details, leaving it unable to trace the mystery guests.

It also claims the couple were driving a silver Audi A3 and posted a CCTV image of them on the property.

The woman has long dark hair and is wearing a pink jumper and jeans, while the man appears to be blonde and is wearing a blue zip up jacket and jeans. 

Police Scotland have confirmed to MailOnline Travel that the matter is being investigated.

A spokesperson said: 'We can confirm we are looking into a report of fraud at Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Crieff.

'The incident occurred between 6.30pm and 9am on February 13/14.

'The man is about 5ft 6ins, of thin build, aged in his late 20s and was wearing a blue jacket. The woman is approximately 5ft 8ins and of medium build. 

'Anyone who has any information are urged to call Police Scotland on 101.'

The owner of the Knock Castle Hotel & Spa has taken to social networks to identify the couple

The Facebook posts also offers a 'reward' to anyone who help identify the guests. 

There are already over 100 comments from Facebook users, with one user cheekily suggesting, 'The one on the right [the man] looks like a shapeshifting reptilian', while others question the hotelier's right to post the pair's pictures without their permission. 

Other users have spoke of their anger at the allegations that the couple left without paying.

Paul Kelly wrote: 'Hope you catch them, your hotel looks very nice and people like this deserve to be caught by whatever means possible,' while Jan Thomson added: 'Sorry for your loss. Police will catch up with them for sure. Someone somewhere knows them'. 

Rhona Murray said: 'Sorry to hear this happened. Hope they are caught.'
