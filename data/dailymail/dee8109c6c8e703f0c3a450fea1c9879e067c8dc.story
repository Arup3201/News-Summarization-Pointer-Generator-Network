The brother of murdered British aid worker Alan Henning has called on David Cameron to send troops to hunt down the Islamic State (IS) militants responsible for his death.

Reg Henning said the brutal Islamist group were 'monsters' and ground forces were needed to find them.

In a BBC interview he said that the Henning family had been in a 'living nightmare' and condemned the Government for preventing them from speaking out about his brother's capture.

A video showing the murder of the 47-year-old former taxi driver from Salford - who was kidnapped on Boxing Day last year at Al-Dana, Syria by IS militants â€“ was posted on the internet by the group.

Reg Henning claimed that it might have made a difference if the family had been allowed to speak out earlier about his capture, rather than only being able to break their silence when he first appeared in an IS video last month.

He told the BBC: 'It's been a living nightmare. We've had to keep it quiet for nine months, we've been gagged by the Government and the Foreign Office not to say a thing. For the last three weeks I've hardly slept, I've felt sick, physically sick.

'We were told not to discuss it, virtually we were gagged for nine months, couldn't say a thing to anybody. It was just done on a need to know basis which, basically, was immediate family.'

Asked how that made him feel he said: 'I think it's disgusting because, if we had been able to talk, and voice our opinions, I think the Government may have stood up and listened more.'

He added: 'We've seen the campaign that Alan's generated now, all the ribbons round Eccles and everything. If this was done six months ago it could have done more good.'

RAF jets have been bombing IS targets in Iraq, but Mr Henning said that would not be enough to defeat IS.

'You're not going to find them by dropping a few bombs in Iraq,' he said.

'We need send ground forces in to find out where these monsters are - the sooner we do it the sooner the killing stops.'

But he backed the Government's policy of not paying ransoms to secure the release of hostages held by IS.

He said that 'by giving them more money you are giving them the opportunity to purchase more arms and weapons and that would just increase the problem because they would be in the position to snatch more hostages'.

Mr Henning, who described his brother's killers as 'barbaric', said he hoped that Mr Cameron 'stands by his word' to hunt down those responsible.

In a message to the Prime Minister, Mr Henning said he wanted those responsible for his brother's death to be brought back to the UK to stand trial.

He said: 'Go and find them, bring them to justice, bring them over here, let us try them.'

In the emotional interview, Mr Henning said that his brother had 'captured the hearts of the public and he did not deserve to die'.

He added: 'I just remember his happy smiling face and the picture in the media where he is holding the young child will be my lasting image of Alan.'
