The superintendent of a high school where sports players created a fantasy sex league has defended her students, saying 'really good kids can make mistakes'.

San Francisco Bay Area school authorities said stories surrounding the statistics-based table story have been sensationalized.

Piedmont Unified School District Superintendent Connie Hubbard told a board meeting on Wednesday: 'The media swirl the last few days began as an honest communication with
parents.

The kids are alright: Piedmont High School's superintendent defended the athletes who made a 'fantasy sex league' about female students

'Viral voices sensationalized what the story was. We will not 
let this deter us.'

There was no information reflecting criminal conduct, Ms Hubbard told the group at the school in California.

The league – created by male athletes
at Piedmont High School – awarded points when girls the boys 'drafted' 
were rumored to have engaged in sexual activity.

Most of the female students who were drafted into the league weren't aware of the competition, the school principal said.

Piedmont is an affluent city near 
Oakland in California.

The league came to light after the school's 
principal informed parents about it last week.

While the news may come as a shock to parents, its existence has been common knowledge among the student body, Principal Rich Kitchen told Mercury News.

The table has been believed to have been running for at least five years. 

According to Principal Rich Kitchens'
letter, varsity athletes used the online competition, modeled after 
fantasy leagues common in major league sports and referred to as a 
'Fantasy Slut League,' as a bonding activity for the last five or six 
years.

Officials found out about it in early 
October after students who came forward following a date-rape prevention 
assembly.

He described the sordid league as being 
part of the 'bonding' process for freshmen joining varsity teams, that 
many students knew about and participated in.

Administrators
interviewed students, parents and staff members but weren't able to 
identify any participants, according to Kitchens.

The headmaster said that it would be 
hard to track down the culprits because three-quarters of the school 
participates in sports teams.

School
Board President Rick Raushenbush said that the district had 'brought an end' to the conduct and would address the issues that led to
it.
