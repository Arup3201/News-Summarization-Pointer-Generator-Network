A police officer has been charged with drink-driving after allegedly returning a positive roadside breath test in the Blue Mountains.

The off-duty officer was arrested at about 10am on Friday after he was stopped for a random test on The Great Western Highway at Lawson.

He was taken to Katoomba Police Station where a breath analysis returned an alleged reading of 0.088, police said.

The officer, attached to the Central Metropolitan Region, was charged with mid-range drink-driving and was bailed to appear at Katoomba Local Court on January 27.

In October, an off-duty Victorian policeman who fled the scene of a car crash was found to have a blood alcohol concentration of .196 as well as the drug ecstasy in his system.

Nathan Harkness pleaded guilty to charges of exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol, careless driving, failing to stop after an accident and failing a drug blood test.

He was convicted on all charges, fined a total of $2000 and had his licence cancelled for 19 months.
