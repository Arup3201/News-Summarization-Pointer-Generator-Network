It's called The Smiler. But unless you’re very, very brave, the chances of smiling when you come off it seem remote.

Alton Towers’s latest rollercoaster cost £18million and has entered the Guinness Book of Records for being the ride with the most loops – 14.

The Smiler, which opens this month,  has drops of 98ft, reaches speeds of up to 52mph and was designed with the help of psychologists and scientists for maximum thrills.

A spokesman for the Staffordshire theme park said: ‘We want people to get off the ride and not know what is real.’

Dizzying: The Smiler is the world's first 14-loop rollercoaster - setting a new Guinness World Record for the most inversions. The new ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire sends thrillseekers off at top speeds of 53mph and well as plunging them by up to 98ft

Alton Tower's £18million record-breaking ride, which includes plunging 30 metre drops, is the biggest in the theme park's history

It beat the 10-loop Colossus in Thorpe Park, Surrey, and another 10-loop ride in China to become the rollercoaster with the most loops.

Katherine Duckworth, one of the team who came up with the concept for the ride, said: 'This ride will put not just your body but also your mind through its paces.

'There are five different mind effects, which are all designed to mess with your head. You shoot towards giant syringes, spinning hypnotic wheels, and flashing lights, among other things.'

The ride blasts towards huge needles and what looks like a drive-through car wash but, of course, the threat they present is only in the mind.

The Smiler is twice the size of Nemesis and lasts two minutes and 45 seconds

'There is more track per square metre than any other ride in the world,' adds Katherine.

'It is twice the size of Nemesis and each ride lasts two minutes and 45 seconds. This is a very big roller coaster ride. When you get off, you wont know what is real.'

Researchers from New Scientist magazine were involved in Smiler's design. They found anticipation is a key factor in ensuring a thrill and that they worked best when presented as stories or narratives.

New Scientist editor Jeremy Webb said: 'All the experiences we use to generate thrill involve an element of fear.

'The emotion is triggered by either something physical, such as pain, or a mental one - most commonly the anticipation of danger.

'Thrill is a combination of fear and the euphoria we experience after everything has ended.

'It is like a good play or horror movie when the excitement builds and your heart starts pumping and then everything is OK at the end.

John Wardley, a ride consultant at Alton Towers, said: 'The Smiler is set to be one of the most thrilling rides in the world.

'To heighten the feeling of excitement we needed a ride with a variety of mental cues.

'The Smiler will be different from other traditional rollercoasters in that it will combine intense physical effects along with unique mental elements.'

Saw – The Ride, Thorpe Park, UKA favourite with bloodthirsty adrenaline seekers, Saw - The Ride opened at Thorpe Park in 2009. The attraction is based on the horror film franchise which spawned four movies and claims to be 'the world’s most terrifying horror rollercoaster'. Riders are carried up to 100ft before being plummeted down towards sharp rotating blades below.

Kingda Ka, Six Flags Great Adventure, New JerseyThis vertigo-inducing ride is the world's tallest coaster…and the fastest in North America. Kingda Ka uses a hydraulic launch to rocket riders horizontally from 0 to 128mph in just 3.5 seconds. Then comes the main tower - 140 metres above the park - before the train climbs a 40-metre camel hump which gives riders the feeling of being weightless.

Takabisha, Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park, JapanJapan's
 Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park laid claim to the title of steepest 
vertical drop of any ride in the world when it opened in July 2011. The 
stomach-flipping Takabisha ride - an attraction that includes seven 
major twists over 1000 metres of track and a nerve-jangling drop of 43 
metres -  features a 121° freefall. The 112-second attraction - which 
means 'dominant' in English - also accelerates to speeds of 100kmph. 
Riders experience weightlessness as they 'nosedive' down the sharp 
incline, before later being plunged into darkness.

Tower of Terror II, Dreamworld, AustraliaOffers a fantastic view of the Gold Coast, if only you dare look down…riders of the recently re-launched Tower of Terror II are propelled backwards and up 100metres into the air. In the nerve-jangling drop back down, there are several seconds of weightlessness.

Formula Rossa, Ferrari World, Abu Dhabi When it comes to speed, Formula Rossa, at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, claims to be the world's fastest rollercoaster.  The Formula One-themed attraction sees goggle-wearing riders reach 240kmph in 4.9 seconds over the course of a 2km track.
