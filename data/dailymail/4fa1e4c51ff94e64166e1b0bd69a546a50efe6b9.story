Dictionary’s word of 2013, but its popularity just earned it another 
accolade - being voted the most annoying and overused term of the past 
12 months.

It topped the list of words Lake Superior State University want to be banished in 2014.

The annual list of annoying words is based on nominations made on the official Banished Words Facebook page.

Each nomination was submitted with a brief explanation of why the word is annoying or should be banned.

According
 to his nomination for the word ‘selfie’, Facebook fan Bruce, from 
Ontario wrote: 'Named 'Word of the Year' by Oxford Dictionary? Give me a
 break! Ugh, get rid of it.'

While
 David Lake from Wisconsin wrote: ‘It's a lame word. It's all about me, 
me, me. Put the smartphone away. Nobody cares about you.’

The term was made popular in 2013 when celebrities, in particular, began posting 'selfies' on Twitter and Instagram.

Even
 U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron 
posed for a selfie with Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt 
at Nelson Mandela's memorial earlier this month.

The word 'twerk' became popular following Miley Cyrus' performance with Robin Thicke at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.

One of the most famous selfies of the past 12 months was the Pope posing with teenagers at the Vatican. The picture went viral on social media and was widely speculated as being the first ever 'Papal selfie'

In
 nominating 'twerk' and 'twerking', Lisa from New York explained: 'I 
twitch when I hear twerk, for to twerk proves one is a jerk - or is at 
least twitching like a jerk. Twerking has brought us to a new low in our
 lexicon.'

'Hashtag' and 'Twittersphere' have been growing in popularity for years and are used most commonly on, and about, Twitter.

Facebook fan Jen, from Michigan wrote in her nomination for 'hashtag': 'It's #obnoxious #ridiculous #annoying and I wish it would disappear.'

Among the other words that made the list was Mr. Mom, following the 30-year anniversary of the 1983 
Michael Keaton movie of the same name. 

The overuse of the words ‘intellectually’ and ‘morally bankrupt’ by politicians was the reason why these words made the list.

While the most annoying words in sports were listed as 'adversity' and 'fan base.'

As
 Facebook user Kyle, from White Lake in Michigan wrote on his 
nomination: 'Facing adversity is working 50 hours a week and still 
struggling to feed your kids. Facing third and fifteen without your best
 receiver with tens of millions in the bank, is not.'

While the biggest criticism for fan base was that it uses two words, when just one – the word ‘fans’ – will do. 

Obamacare dominated the headlines earlier this year when the U.S. suffered a federal shutdown over the health reform plans.

Another popular word that the poll claimed was overused in the press was T-Bone, a word used to describe a layout of a car accident.

The term '...on steroids' was slammed for being overused when describing something as being fast or strong.

While 'Ageddon and Pocalypse' - as shortened versions of Armageddon and Apocalypse - were also overused in 2013 according to the poll.
