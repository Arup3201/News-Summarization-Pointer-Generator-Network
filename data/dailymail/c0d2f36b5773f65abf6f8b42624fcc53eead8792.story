It seems Theresa May has been taking style tips from catwalk models after being spotted in a Black Watch tartan suit worn by Cara Delevingne just last month.

The Home Secretary wore the Vivienne Westwood trouser suit to the second day of the Conservative Party Conference yesterday.

The outfit was first worn by Ms Delevingne on her 21st birthday last month.

Fashion conscious: Mrs May in her Vivienne Westwood suit at the Tory conference yesterday

Snap: The £1,190 suit that Mrs May, left, wore yesterday was first worn by Cara at her birthday last month

Mrs May teamed her £1,190 outfit with £215 jewel-encrusted flat dance shoes from Russell & Bromley.

Mrs May delivered her speech in Manchester in the fashionable Anglomania suit, which features large lapels and an asymmetric finish.

The home secretary teamed the outfit with a crisp white shirt, a style similar to Ms Delevigne’s.

Mrs May and Ms Delevingne both wore statement necklaces and black belts with their high-waisted trousers.

The home secretary complemented her look with red lipstick and matching red nails.

Mrs May is renowned for her accessorising her often-daring outfits with kitten heels.

Bold choice: Mrs May's Vivienne Westwood suit has also been seen on model Cara Delevingne

Her love of shoes emerged at the Tory party conference in Bournemouth in 2002 when her £110 Russell & Bromley ponyskin kitten heels caused a sensation.

But the leopard print wellies she famously wore to the party conference in 2009 were derided by fashion critics.

Numerous other fashion-forward choices were made at the conference yesterday.

Such as these bodycon dresses, which may look similar - but their price tags could not be more different.

Businesswoman Karren Brady, 44, and 
William Hague’s wife Ffion, 45, wore lookalike grey fitted dresses with 
black panelling to the second day of the Conservative Party conference 
yesterday.

But while 
Mrs Hague opted for a £583 Escada dress, the multi-millionaire 
vice-chairman of West Ham United chose a £38 BHS number.

Mrs Hague’s designer dress – once worn by billionaire Oprah Winfrey on the David Letterman show – cost 15 times more than Ms Brady’s modest high street piece.

Miss Brady, who is also Lord Sugar’s assistant on The Apprentice, yesterday unveiled as the government’s small business mbassador, teamed her tweed, lace panelled dresses with nude heels.

Mrs Hague opted for electric blue courts and a waist belt with her bodycon dress- which is stands for body contouring.

Ms Brady yesterday said Chancellor George Osborne was ‘the right man with the right plan’ as she revealed she was taking up a role as the Conservatives’ ‘small business ambassador’.
