George Barker arriving at court today where jurors heard he exposed himself in front of a sleeping teenager so his team-mates could take a photograph

A footballer told a court today that he had exposed himself in front of a sleeping teenager so his team-mates could take a photograph.

George Barker, 21, said he and five other footballers were 'laughing and joking' in the Brighton hotel room where the 19-year-old had joined them.

Barker told the Old Bailey that his friend Anton Rodgers, 20, was the first to pull his boxer shorts down and pose for a picture.

Brighton and Hove Albion players Barker, Rodgers, Lewis Dunk, 21, and former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, deny sexual assault and voyeurism.

The offences are alleged to have taken place in July 2011 after the Brighton players went clubbing to celebrate a win.

The woman, who is now 21, admitted telling police 'a pack of lies' after missing work the next day but said she revealed what happened after a row with her boyfriend months later.

Barker, the first of the players to give evidence, claimed that the alleged victim was 
‘openly pursuing’ Brighton footballers that night and kissed different 
members of the team.

In a prepared statement he said he left the club early with Rodgers and they returned to their room at the Jury’s Inn Hotel and went to bed.

He was woken by the sound of voices and saw the woman sitting on their double bed.

He said: 'She was talking to us, having a laugh and joking, getting involved in the banter.

'She got into the bed and got in between us under the duvet. We carried on laughing and joking for about 15 minutes.

'Then she started kissing Anton, kissing his lips, snogging. She then rolled over and started kissing me on the lips.

'It was a bit of a shock to start with. She rolled back to Anton and started kissing him again, then she rolled back again and then started kissing me again. Then she fell asleep.'

He added: ‘She appeared to want to have sexual intercourse. I did not want to have
sexual intercourse with her. She initiated kissing and cuddling.

‘I felt very awkward as a result of her actions towards me. I was embarrassed by her advances towards me in front of others.’

He said fellow players Ben Sampayo and Leon Redwood were also in the room.

Barker said: 'I remember there was talking, suggesting photographs would be taken.

'I remember someone saying, "Anton, you have got the biggest d***, so get it out".

'It was to make the boys laugh, I guess.'

He said Rodgers posed for a photograph standing on the bed next to the woman with his genitals exposed.

'I was laughing at him,' added Barker.

He said he also pulled his boxer shorts down and posed but, like Rodgers, did not touch her.

Barker added: ‘I stood next to her and had my photo taken. I did not have any sexual gratification from doing so.’

Barker said he left the room and when he returned he saw someone had written his initials in foam on the woman’s thigh, and he posed with his thumbs up next to her.

He said he saw four pictures taken before leaving the room, and the only time he saw any of the pictures was some days later when Rodgers allegedly sent him a copy of the GB picture.

The court was told it was the only picture found by police on any of the players’ phones.

Barker denied that the Brighton 
footballers described the alleged victim as a ‘slag’ but admitted he 
thought she was a ‘bit of a slapper.’

He said: ‘After kissing Ronald [Bergkamp] in the club, texting Leon 
[Redwood], then kissing me and Anton, I was thinking... she liked to 
kiss.’

Prosecutor Richard Barton asked what was 
funny about taking a picture of the alleged victim sprawled out on the 
bed, Barker replied: ‘The fact she was passed out, that was it.’

Mr Barton said: ‘You ended up masturbating over her... group shots of you masturbating over her unconscious body.’

Barker replied: ‘No.’

Mr Barton: ‘The purpose of these photos was that they were humiliating 
for her. You were humiliating this slapper, as far as you thought... and
you were all in that together.’

Steve Cook, 21, admitted that two of his teammates exposed themselves 
while taking photos of the ‘half asleep’ woman.

But he denied they touched her with their genitals and added: ‘It was just a laugh, just a bit of boy banter.’

The Old Bailey has heard how Cook and Rodgers, the 
19 year-old son of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, Lewis Dunk, 21, and Barker, 21, met the alleged victim at a club while celebrating a 
cup final win in July 2011.

She said she woke up to find herself lying half naked next to Rodgers and discovered the ‘humiliating’ photos on his phone.

They showed the footballers touching themselves while standing around 
her and putting their genitals on her hand and face, jurors heard.

Allegation: Jury's Inn, Brighton, where the assault is alleged to have taken place following a night out

During his interviews in January and February 2012, Cook told police 
that he did not touch the 19 year-old and was fully clothed.

But he admitted that he saw some of his teammates taking a couple of photos with their genitals ‘out’.

Summarising the interview, prosecutor Richard Barton said: ‘He wasn’t 
sure who was taking them. They had a laugh, she was half asleep. She was
half and half, drifting to sleep.

‘When the two people had their penises out they were just laughing and joking. He thought one of those was Anton Rodgers.

‘He believed a couple of photos were taken. No-one touched her with their penises. It was just a laugh, just a bit of boy banter.

‘The defendant did not pose for any photographs and had his clothes on all night.’

Cook also denied seeing any photos posted on the internet or hearing discussions about it around the football club.

Asked whether he was one of the men masturbating over her chest, he 
replied: ‘No, not a chance, no. I never got my penis out in that room 
that night. I never took a photo.’

Dunk told police that he did not see any photos being taken. ‘All I saw was the shaving foam,’ he added, claiming that another 
player, Leon Redwood, sprayed the letters GB in foam on the woman’s leg 
while she was asleep.

The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.
