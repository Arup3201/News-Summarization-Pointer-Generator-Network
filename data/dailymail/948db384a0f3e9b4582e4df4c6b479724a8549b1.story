A teenager has become the first ever openly gay head boy to be given the role at one of the country's elite group of public schools.

Will Emery, 17, who came out to his family three years ago, was voted in by more than 1,000 pupils and staff at Brighton College in Sussex, one of the most successful schools of its type in Britain, with boarding fees starting at £27,000 a year.

Emery, the son of a banker, said: 'I don't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen, but in other periods, when people had to hide their sexuality, it could have been a different story.'

The new head boy appointed at Brighton College is an openly gay teenager. It is the first time a top public school has made such an appointment

Headmaster Richard Cairns said there was a huge round of applause when the announcement was made and said teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 see sexuality as a 'so-what' issue.

He added: 'He was a very popular choice - the rugby players voted for him along with many others - but I bet if I wrote to the old boys and said our head boy was openly gay, some of them would think it's very strange indeed.'

Mr Emery has used his new position to speak critically of schools that use policies that stopteachers from discussing homosexuality.

Gay rights campaigners have highlighted 40 schools that use sex education policies that forbid 'promoting' homosexuality, similar to the controversial section 28 of the Local Government Act implemented by Thatcher's government.

'I don't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen, but in other periods, when people had to hide their sexuality, it could have been a different story'

Section 28 made it an offence for a local authority to 'intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality' or to 'promote the teaching in any maintained school the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship'.

It has since been repealed.

The teenager's stance is supported by Mr Cairns, who described the schools' actions as 'outrageous'.

Mr Emery, speaking to The Sunday Times, said the root of the issue lies with the attitudes of those running the schools.

He said: 'They grew up in a society where homosexuality wasn't spoken about. Their views need to be changed.'
