The fans have been camped out for days, the UK's strawberry farmers are rubbing their hands in glee and industrial quantities of Pimms are being delivered to south London: Wimbledon is back.

But it's not all Pimms and strawberries. Descending on the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club are some of the world's best players and supporting them every step of the way will be there loyal wives and girlfriends.

Leading the pack is defending champion Andy Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears - whose facial expressions reflect the feelings of the nation when she grimaces at Andy's double faults and smiles with joy when he clinches victory.

His biggest fan: Kim was delighted when Andy clinched victory at last 
year's Wimbledon. She'll be cheering him all the way again as he defends
 his title

While Kim will be cheering Andy Murray on from the stands, another tennis WAG, Maria 
Sharapova, will have work on her mind. Fresh 
from victory at the French Open, Maria already seems to have inspired her other half
Grigor Dimitrov up his game, with recent wins including victory in the Aegon Championships at Queens Club a
 fortnight ago.

But the glamorous, successful Sharapova isn't the only tennis WAG with a career to match - or surpass - her man's. As the action gets underway in London, FEMAIL rounds up the women who'll be hoping their man is a winner at Wimbledon.

Kim Sears has been in a relationship with Andy Murray for the nine years and he has admitted he couldn't have come back to win Wimbledon in 2013 following his 2012 defeat if it hadn't been for her unwavering support.

Loyal: Pretty Kim shuns the limelight and spends her days painting dogs and cats and selling them online,Â  but never misses an important tournament

Unlike many football WAGS, Kim shys away from the spotlight as she focuses on her career as an artist and looks after the couple's beloved dogs Maggie May and Rusty at their home in Surrey.

She's a fan of the British high street, with Zara and Whistles among her favourites, and is likely to be spotted showcasing both at this year's tournament - along with avoiding questions on when Andy will propose.

Top tennis player Maria Sharapova will be backing her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov all the way but more importantly, she will also be on her own quest for Wimbledon glory and is hotly tipped to do well.

Taking part: Maria Sharapova will be supporting boyfriend Grigor 
Dimitrov but the tennis champ will also be focusing on her own game

Both champs: Maria was in the stands to see Grigor win the Aegon Championships at Queens Club earlier this month

The Russian won the title in 2004 but has struggled with her form in recent years on the grass. Tennis' power couple have been dating since 2012 and Maria's winning ways certainly seem to be rubbing off on her other half.

So far this year Dimitrov has taken the men's singles title at Queens and hopes for a good showing at Wimbledon, while Sharapova herself triumphed at Roland Garros.

Rather sweetly, Dimitrov credited his other half with helping him to his recent victory. He said: 'She's just been unbelievable, supporting me throughout the year. The feeling is pretty mutual.'

Roger Federer's wife Mirka could be forgiven for not watching him at every match this year, after giving birth to twins Leo and Lenny in May. The couple already had twin girls, four-year-old Myla Rose and Charlene Riva.

Federer, who has won 17 grand slam titles, currently has no thoughts of retiring and likes to take his family with him when he travels to tournaments around the world.

Big family: Mirka Federer gave birth to twin sons Leo and Lenny in May and, with husband Roger, already has four-year-old twin daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva

He said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it.

'My wife does a lot of work, as much as she can. And I try to help as much as I can,' he explained. 'We have the grandparents as well and all my team members, they sometimes just tag along. Clearly we also need some help on the road, so Mirka can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit, or come to watch one of my matches.

'You need to be well organised, but by now we know how it works. I am looking forward to life on the tour with the family, and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years now.'

Beautiful Maria Xisca Perello has been inundated with requests to take part in photo shoots but like other tennis WAGS, the girlfriend of world number one Rafael Nadal shuns the limelight.

Support: Like Nadal, Maria is a fan of keeping fit but unlike her other half, she's not so keen on travel and refused to attend the Australian Open because it was 'too far'

The couple have been dating since they were teenagers but she doesn't travel to watch him at all his tournaments. When Rafa played in the Australian Open final earlier this year, he said his girlfriend hadn't come to watch as it was 'too far'.

Speaking about their relationship earlier this year, a friend of the couple, Pedro Hernadez, said: 'Raf and Xisca are both very shy and ordinary people who like to live simply.

'They are not at all interested in a celebrity lifestyle. They get together when the tournaments are over. That's how Raf winds down.'

Although currently expecting a baby with her other half, Novak Djokovic, Jelena Ristic has no intention of giving up her day job - masterminding Djokovic's charity for disadvantaged children from their native Serbia.

Blessed: Jelena Ristic and Novak Djokovic are looking forward to becoming parents later this year but Ristic won't be giving up her charity work

The current world number two announced that the couple were soon to become parents on Twitter earlier this year writing: 'Jelena is pregnant!!! We will be parents soon! #blessed'.

If a coming child wasn't enough of a blessing, the pair, who announced their engagement in September last year, are expected to tie the knot after this year's Wimbledon.

SOAP ACTRESS: BEC HEWETTShe might have swapped Summer Bay for tennis WAG-dom but former Home and Away actress Bec hasn't lost her all-Australian surfer girl appeal in the nine years she has been married to tennis player Lleyton Hewitt.

Famous face: Lleyton Hewitt's wife Rebecca used to be a Home and Away star but like her husband, complains of being on the receiving end of too much press attention

The couple have two daughters, Mia and Ava, and a son, Cruz but, thanks to Hewitt's high profile and regular appearances in gossip magazines, complain of having to deal with constant paparazzi attention.

Writing on his blog, Hewitt said: 'Week after week the paparazzi hide in cars, follow us, trying to take photos at any opportunity where they think they can get a shot where we don't look happy.'

Recently Bec had to deny she was set to return to Summer Bay after rumours began circulating that she was planning to reprise her role in the soap which she left 10 years ago.

Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka's wife Ilham Vuilloud is famous in her own right in their home country of a Switzerland, thanks to a successful career that has included stints as a model and as a TV television presenter.

The couple, who married in 2010 and have a daughter, Alexia, are among the most stylish faces on the tennis circuit with the ever-chic Vuilloud rarely looking anything less than perfect.

As well as his faithful girlfriend Kim, Andy, 27, will also have the full support of his mother, Judy as he takes to the court to defend his Wimbledon title.

Proud parent Judy follows all her son's matches and has been instrumental in his success, getting him into the sport through her own career as a tennis coach.

But there's also a new woman in Andy's life this year - his coach Amelie Mauresmo. The former grand slam champion was announced as the Brit's new coach after the French Open.
