West Ham have revived their £3.5million deal for striker Diafra Sakho following complaints from his club Metz. 

The French side threatened to lodge an official complaint with UEFA after West Ham pulled out of the transfer despite the player undergoing a medical. 

Personal terms had been agreed with the striker but West Ham changed from wanting a permanent deal to a loan move at the last minute according to the Metz.

The newly promoted Ligue 1 club criticised the Hammers' 'unacceptable lack of respect' during the transfer procedure. 

Meanwhile, West Bromwich Albion are poised to bid £7.25million for West Ham winger Matt Jarvis. 

The 28-year-old has failed to rediscover the form that earned him an England call-up while at Wolves and the Upton Park club will sell.
