Jailed: Jamie Dixon was sentenced to eight years and ten months for terrorising homes across the Midlands and threatening a child with an axe

Three armed raiders who forced their way into homes to steal luxury cars and even threatened a nine-year-old boy with an axe have been jailed for almost 29 years.

Gavin Hunt, 37, joined brothers Jamie Dixon, 32, and Christopher Dixon, 29, in a year-long tirade across the Midlands.

Armed with sledgehammers, a crowbar and an axe, the gang broke into private homes and terrorised owners into surrendering their valuables.

On one occasion they threatened a nine-year-old boy with the axe in a bid to make off with his father's two luxury cars.

The gang burst into the home of wealthy property developer Rajinder Auluk in Birmingham, West Midlands.

They told the terrified child they would 'cut him' unless he handed over cash and valuables.

Mr Auluk gave the armed gang the keys and they quickly made off with his Nissan Pulsar GTR and a Mercedes CLK. 

The cars were later found abandoned nearby.

Blasting the Birmingham-based trio as 'cowardly and callous', Judge Paul Farrer QC sentenced them to a total of 28 years and 11 months.

Hunt admitted two charges of conspiracy to rob and was jailed for 12 years and 10 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday.

Jamie Dixon admitted one charge of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to eight years and ten months.

He was also classified as a 'dangerous offender' - meaning he must serve two thirds of his sentence before being eligible for parole.

His brother Christopher Dixon admitted one charge of conspiracy to rob and was jailed for seven years and three months.

Mr Farrer said: 'Sledgehammers, a crow bar and on one occasion an axe were carried in order to terrorise the people within.

'High value property was targeted and successfully stolen.'

The judge also said the gang's planning involved 'real sophistication,' adding: 'Reconnaissance trips were conducted to scout out the premises to be robbed.'

And he described the incident involving the Mr Auluk's nine-year-old son as an attack 'which no right thinking individual would have contemplated.'

Seized: They made off with this black Nissan GTR after threatening the owner's nine-year-old son with an axe

Prosecutor 
Malcolm Morse, told the court that between the end of 2012 and January 
this year the gang 'knew what they wanted' and attacked five homes as 
well as two cash and carry premises.

The
 gang wore dark clothes, gloves and balaclavas and targeted Audis 
including one worth £70,000 which was taken from an address in 
Northampton.

Victims
 were also tied with plastic cable ties and on another occasion a member
 wore a 'scream' mask before bursting into a house in Boldmere, Sutton 
Coldfield, West Mids.

Stolen: They broke into the Birmingham home of property develop Rajinder Auluk to steal his Mercedes

And when the householder tried to repel the gang with a hammer, he was hit a number of times with a crowbar.

The court also heard the gang broke into 
Mr Auluk's £360,000 detached family home and held an axe against his 
nine-year-old son's neck on January 28 this year.

Speaking at the time, the father-of-two said: 'We had just finished eating when my nine-year-old son went into the front room to get ready to watch wrestling on the TV.

Trauma: Mr Auluk, 40, has spoken out about his terror - and that of his son who was faced with an axe

'I heard a 
loud crash at the front door and suddenly an explosion hit me in the 
face as these men with axes and sledgehammers came piling through the 
door.

'I said, 'take what you want' but they carried on shouting and held an axe to my youngest's neck.

'It was true panic. I was angry and frightened, but my main concern was what they were going to do to the little guy, I thought he was going to cut him.'

Another family in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, were tied up and barricaded into a room while the crooks raided their home.

Mr Morse told the court a laptop found at Hunt's home showed that the sophisticated gang had researched premises before attacking them.

He said that Hunt and Jamie Dixon were arrested after the Audi they had stolen - which had a tracker device - ran out of petrol.

Defending Hunt, Michael Anning said he had been recruited to play a specific role of driving to and from the offences and that no extreme violence had been used.

After the hearing, Detective Constable Damian Forrest, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We are satisfied with the sentences handed to these dangerous individuals, and that they will no longer be able to terrorise residents in their homes or people at work for cash and cars.

'Thankfully, none of the victims were badly hurt in these robberies, but I have no doubt that the gang would have used serious violence to achieve their objectives if they had not got what they wanted.

'These robberies had a serious effect on the families targeted and I know they are pleased Hunt and the Dixon brothers will spend a considerable amount of time behind bars for what they put them through.'
