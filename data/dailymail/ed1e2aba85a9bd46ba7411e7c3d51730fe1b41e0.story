It is one of the most famous battles in English history and marks the last time the country was conquered by a foreign army.

But now the Government’s advisers on England’s heritage are to investigate new evidence that might prove the true location of the Battle of Hastings is two miles from where historians have long accepted it took place.

English Heritage’s battlefield committee is to look at two competing cases which challenge the long-held belief that the bloody encounter took place on land commemorated by the foundation of Battle Abbey, near Hastings in East Sussex.

The alternative sites are on nearby Caldbec Hill, and two miles away near the village of Crowhurst.

At the 1066 battle, William Duke of Normandy vanquished Harold’s army, securing the success of the Norman Conquest.

Historian Nick Austin says there have been historical finds backing his claim in support of Crowhurst over the years.

The case for Caldbec Hill is made by another historian, John Grehan.

Last night English Heritage confirmed it was investigating, adding: ‘If there is a compelling case that the registered battlefield merits amendment, we will review the evidence.’

Doubts: It has been suggested that the Battle of Hastings, famously depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry (pictured), may in fact have taken place at a different location
