Britain’s £600 million fruit industry is on high alert - after a tiny Asian fruit fly that devastates crops was found for the first time in this country.

Growers of soft fruits like strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries are being warned the pest is probably already attacking crops here.

The spotted wing vinegar fly is just 2-3mm long but can also pose a threat to harder fruit like apples and pears.

The tiny Asian fruit fly - the spotted wing vinegar fly known as drosophila suzukii - devastates soft fruit crops. It has been found in Kent.

The particularly nasty pest wrecked £300 million worth of crops in California alone the first year it was discovered there.

Five flies were found in raspberry and blackberry plots at fruit trial centre East Malling Research in Kent earlier this month.

But experts warn that the pest, which is rife in continental Europe, North America and Asia, is probably already widespread here too.

In many countries it is suspected that the fly arrived up to three years before damage was first seen in crops.

Once established, the pesky insect has proven impossible to eradicate and growers are being urged to look out for infestations.

Other fruit at risk include blackcurrants, redcurrants, gooseberries, cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, grapes and tomatoes.

Unlike common fruit flies that attack rotting fruit, the spotted wing also attacks developing fruits on the plant.

Britain's £600m fruit industry is on red alert after the pest was spotted in Kent. It has proved impossible to eradicate elsewhere in the world.

The fruit is quickly spoiled as the female bores through its skin to lay eggs.

When they hatch, maggots gnaw through the rest of the fruit and it falls, wasted, to the ground.

Females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year.

Dr Michelle Fountain, an entomologist at East Malling, said: 'The trouble with this species is it’ll lay its eggs when the fruit is actually ripening, so obviously that has massive consequences for the fruit.

'There could be punnets with larvae in and you might not know they are there.'

The fly, known as drosophila suzukii, originated in south-east Asia but reached the US in 2008, Italy in 2009 and Canada, Russia, France and Spain in 2010.

Adult flies are brownish-yellow with black bands on the abdomen, up to 3mm long with bright red eyes.

With distinctive red eyes, the insects are easy to spot.

Dr Fountain said that the flies have had a 'massive impact' on grower practices in affected countries.

They have had to spray crops with pesticides more often and wait longer before harvesting.

The Horticultural Development Company, which advises fruit growers, has put out a briefing note warning them about the grim discovery at East Malling.

It said: 'Adult flies have been identified both in wild blackberry and raspberry breeding plots on site.

'Spotted wing drosphila is an aggressive pest of berry and stone fruits.

'Experience in North America and Europe has shown it spreads very rapidly both in commercial crops and in wild hosts, especially wild blackberry.

The flies are often used in experiments because they breed so quickly

'It is therefore very probably widespread in the UK and already attacking vulnerable crops, though the extent of its spread is currently unknown.

'It is vital that routine weekly monitoring of berry fruit crops at risk - especially raspberry, blackberry and blueberry - is started as soon as possible.

'Monitoring for both larvae and adults is recommended but monitoring for larvae is crucially important to avoid the risk of infested fruit being sent to market.

Adult flies are brownish-yellow with black bands on the abdomen, up to 3mm long with bright red eyes.

Females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year.

'In the event that the pest is found, a programme of weekly sprays should be implemented as soon as possible.'

The Government’s Food & Environment Research Agency (Fera) admitted that drastic measures like quarantine areas and compulsory destruction of crops have been ruled out.

Fera’s Richard Mcintosh said: 'Once the pest is here, eradication would be impossible as the flies breed and spread very quickly.

'Very stringent statutory requirements on growers like destruction of crops would be needed, which would be seen as disproportionate and so eradication is not a realistic prospect.'

In the US, growers suffered losses of up to 80 per cent of their crops depending on location and fruit.

The Californian fruit industry lost £300 million due to pest damage in 2008, the first year it was seen in the state.

Robert Pascall grows strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, apples, pears and plums for supply to the major supermarket chains.

His 250-hectare Clock House Farm in Coxheath, Kent, is close to where the flies were found.

He said: 'We should be concerned, though so far it’s an unknown quantity.

'We will try to keep the crops clean, so as not to leave them open to infestation, and take all the advice we can from the experts.

'Industry body British Summer Fruits represents suppliers of around 90 per cent of all berries supplied to the UK’s leading supermarkets.

The BSF’s Nicholas Marston said: 'There is absolutely no need for consumers to be alarmed, Spotted Wing Drosophila does not pose any food safety risk or any risk to consumer’s health.

'The Horticulture Development Council and our growers have been and will continue to be vigilant in monitoring evidence of its existence.

'A great deal has been learnt from the US on monitoring, chemical control and hygiene which is being communicated to the industry and it is possible to control it effectively.'
