A 'hero dog' who alerted residents when their New Jersey apartment building was on fire last Friday  has been found dead after disappearing in the blaze.

Ann Marie Kelt, 51, and her longtime friend Rocky Granata were woken by Kelt's pet Labrador Stella as smoke filled her King Georges Road home around 6am.

Thanks to the barking everyone evacuated the building safely but Stella got left behind.

Neighbors thought the canine had run off, however on Tuesday her remains were found in the rubble of her former abode.

Hero: A black Labrador named Stella who alerted residents when their New Jersey apartment building was on fire last Friday has been found dead after disappearing in the blaze

Granata told My Central Jersey that he discovered the black mixed-breed canine under a blanket.

She appeared to be guarding her owner's purse, which remained intact.

'[Stella] had her mother's pocketbook. She knew how important it was,' Granata said. 'That was amazing.'

Kelt's daughter, Megan Holden of Sayreville, said that Stella previously suffered from cancer and had a heart condition.

Due to her illness, a veterinarian believed the pet probably died after taking a few breaths in the smoke-filled apartment.

'I pray she did go quickly,' Holden said. 

The St. Georges Veterinary Hospital gave the family a keepsake paw print and arranged for Stella's cremation.

Other than her purse, Kelt lost everything in the fire.

She and Granata were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation and anxiety.

A third resident in the apartment block was also treated and all were released after getting the go-ahead.

Kelt is currently staying with her daughter while Granata has been relocated to a hotel.

The two friends attended the same high school and bonded after battling cancer together.

The local community is now rallying together to raise funds for the out-of-home couple.
