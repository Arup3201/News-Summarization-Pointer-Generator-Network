Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has leapt to the defence of Raheem Sterling after claims the teenager dived to try and win a penalty in Saturday's goalless draw with Sunderland.

The England youngster, who will celebrate his 20th birthday on Monday, collapsed under a challenge from Wes Brown towards the end of the game at Anfield, but referee Neil Swarbrick waved away the subsequent penalty claims.

Rodgers insists that there were no devious intentions behind Sterling's fall - instead claiming that the winger is so fast and tricky that he is vulnerable to losing his balance even at the slightest contact.

Brendan Rodgers agrees it was not a penalty but insists Sterling did not take a dive

'He is so bright around the box and makes defenders tackle him and want to get around him,' said Rodgers. 

'When you watch it closely, Wes Brown has a dangle for the ball, misses it, and Raheem moves to the side. As he comes down with his foot, he probably just lands on Wes Brown.

'I didn't think it was a dive, but I don't think it was a penalty. I just think it was one of those coming togethers in the box that sometimes happens and the referee made the right decision.'

Meanwhile, the Liverpool manager has urged his players to step up instead of relying solely on Steven Gerrard after again resting his captain for the game against Sunderland ahead of a decisive Champions League fixture against Basle next week.

‘It is very hard to replace that quality,’ Rodgers said of Gerrard. 

‘You see that pass when Stevie first came on; not too many in the whole league could play that, that quality. He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and that is something of course we will need.

‘But we can’t always rely on Stevie. His talent is world class but that contribution has to come from the team. It can’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday.’
