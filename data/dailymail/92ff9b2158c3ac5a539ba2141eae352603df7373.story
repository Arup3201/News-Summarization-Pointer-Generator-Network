A  new mother, who was committed to looking slim and healthy, worked out at the gym four times a week despite being pregnant - and now she's a finalist in a body competition.

Jennifer Prosser, 27, would train six times a week before her baby bump appeared, running for up to an hour every day along with a half an hour toning session at her local gym and she didn't want to ditch her regime after falling pregnant. 

Jennifer, who lives in Didsbury, Manchester, said: 'When I turned 18 I enjoyed going out so I always made sure I was training to keep fit.

Fighting fit: Jennifer Prosser, 27, trained six times a week before her baby bump appeared and she discovered she was expecting a baby girl. When she discovered she was pregnant, she continued to hit the gym four times a week and said it worked wonders

'There was always a lot of peer pressure to look good during your teen years. I never wanted that to change even after I found out that I was pregnant with Madison.

'People always look at you when you're training with a huge bump in your belly - it almost feels like training when you're pregnant is frowned upon.

'But there's no doubting that there are great benefits as Madison was born fit and healthy.'

The full-time mother, who gave up her job as a beauty therapist, even took up weight training during her pregnancy to keep her body in shape.

Boyfriend Gavin Jones, 33, told Jennifer her body looked 'incredible' during her pregnancy but the mother said her fitness schedule turned many heads at the gym.

Competitive: Jennifer is now in the running for Body Of The Year and despite her gruelling training regime still dotes on one-year-old Madison

'Gavin actually said when I was giving birth that my leg and stomach muscles were working like crazy,' she said.

'I really had toned up. I just want to keep it up as much as I can and with a bit of luck I can hopefully win the Body of the Year title.'

After the birth, Jennifer piled on two-and-a-half-stone and weighed 11st 7lbs. But within just 12 months of being a new mother she has shed the pounds and is now a size 8.

Did it pay off? Jennifer says that when she was giving birth, her boyfriend noticed that her leg and stomach muscles were working 'like crazy'

Chasing first place: Jennifer says she wants to keep  up her regime as much as she can and with a bit of luck, she can  win the Body of the Year title

Jennifer is now in the running for Body Of The Year and despite her gruelling training regime still dotes on one-year-old Madison.

She said: 'I entered the competition through the Women's Health magazine at the beginning of the year.

'Then out of nowhere I got a phone call saying that I had been listed for the final 10 of the competition.

'I went to London where I had interviews about why I loved fitness so much and to do a range of photo shoots - it was a great experience.

'Then I found out I'd made the final five - I genuinely couldn't believe it. I just want to prove that mums shouldn't be scared to train while they're pregnant - I did and it worked wonders for me.'

Is it safe? An NHS spokesman said: 'Exercise is not dangerous for your baby - there is some evidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour'

Judging: Speaking about working out when carrying, she said: 'People always look at you when you're training with a huge bump in your belly - it almost feels like training when you're pregnant is frowned upon'

Jennifer beat more than a thousand entrants to be named in the top 10 of the competition and qualified for the final five in August.

A spokesperson for the NHS said: 'The more active and fit you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for you to adapt to your changing shape and weight gain.

'It will also help you to cope with labour and get back into shape after the birth. Keep up your normal daily physical activity or exercise for as long as you feel comfortable.

In the running, literally: The former beauty therapist beat more than a thousand entrants to be named in the top 10 of the competition and qualified for the final five in August

'Exercise is not dangerous for your baby - there is some evidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour.

'You may need to slow down as your pregnancy progresses or if your maternity team advises you to.

'If in doubt, consult your maternity team. As a general rule, you should be able to hold a conversation as you exercise when pregnant.

'If you become breathless as you talk, then you're probably exercising too strenuously.'

Voting for the competition ends on October 3.
