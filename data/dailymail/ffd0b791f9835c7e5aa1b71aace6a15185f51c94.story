Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford has revealed how he carried an injured deer for two miles to his home after finding it while out walking his dogs.

The long jumper, 28, discovered the young animal, which he later named Doris, near his home in Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

He called the RSPCA only to be told that the deer, which had broken its leg, would have to be put down.

But the father-of-one, who won gold for Britain at the London 2012 Olympics, decided instead to have the animal cared for by staff at the local TiggyWinkles animal hospital.

Revealing his attempts to rescue the deer to his 155,000 Twitter followers, he wrote: ‘Just carried an injured deer about 2 miles home and now awaiting the RSPCA to come and help the little fella. Poor thing has a broken leg.’

He later provided updates, describing how staff at the animal hospital had put its leg in a splint and how they were hopeful it would survive.

The athlete later revealed that the animal was unable to move when he found it while out walking his three dogs.

Not wanting to leave it in pain, he carried it two miles and arrived home exhausted and covered in blood to the astonishment of his partner Susie. 

He is quoted in the Mirror as saying: ‘After explaining what happened I called the RSPCA but they said if they did collect it then they would have to put it down. I didn’t want this to happen.

‘So I found a local animal sanctuary that’s also a 24-hour animal hospital. They came and put the deer’s leg in a splint and took it off to recover.’

But despite his efforts and the care from staff at TiggyWinkles, Doris reportedly lost her battle to survive this afternoon.

Mr Rutherford’s spokesman said this afternoon that the Olympian was ‘saddened’ to hear of the animal’s death

The head nurse, Clare Campbell is quoted in the Mirror as saying Doris was put down because she was suffering from ‘horrific’ pelvic injuries.

‘We are still happy she was rescued because otherwise she would have taken days to die in agony in the wild. At least we were able to give her pain relief and keep her warm and dry,’ she is reported as saying.

Mr Rutherford’s spokesman said the Olympian was ‘saddened’ to hear of the animal’s death, the Mirror reports.
