An extraordinary video has documented the moment a father became the world's first man to witness his son's birth using virtual reality technology from 4000km away.

In a breakthrough for virtual technology, Perth father-of-three Jason Larke was 'in the same room' as his wife and mother-in-law from three time zones away when his third child was delivered in a Perth hospital last month. 

Mr Larke, who is a fly-in, fly-out electrical contractor, is based in Chinchilla, Queensland and was able to 'appear' in the Perth birthing suite on February 20 via a Samsung live-streaming headset.

In a matter of seconds 4000km disappeared and the parents were able to share one of life’s most profound moments

Amazingly, The Samsung Gear VR let Mr Larke virtually walk around the room, even taking in parts of the suite that were behind him.

His wife Alison wore an earpiece so she could hear Mr Larke's encouraging words and speak to him as if he were in the room. 

Mr Larke is on a four and one rota, meaning he works four weeks in a row and has one week off, when he is able to fly home to his young family.

The couple realised early in Alison's pregnancy that they would be apart for the birth of their child. 

After noticing a social media message online on the hunt for couples who would be separated for profound moments, Alison and Jason applied and became the first couple to try out the new Samsung technology. 

Speaking to Perth Now, Alison Larke said it was the best possible scenario for the couple. 

'It was a bit like The Matrix,' Mrs Larke said.

'He was next to my bed and at one point I said; 'turn around and wave to mum'.

'It really was the next best thing to having him there because the decision to be separate for the birth was an extremely tough one.'

Mr Larke was overjoyed that he didn't miss the birth of his son. 

‘Healthy boy, healthy mum and I got to see it so there’s nothing better than seeing your baby for the first time, he said.
