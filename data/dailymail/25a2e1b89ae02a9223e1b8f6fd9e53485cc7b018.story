Pope Francis has told Roma gypsies to 'get a job' and integrate more in society. 

Speaking during a visit to a Roma community, the Pope told 40 gypsy members to try and contribute more. 

He said: 'Seek work and integration, without ever succumbing to despair. I greet you and I wish all good things for you. That you will always have peace in your families, that you have work, that you have joy.' 

He then said: 'The Church is with you, it welcomes you always, especially this parish. Always be close to the Church. Don't lose hope.' 

After the speech, Pope Francis greeted and hugged the Roma gypsies present in the Prima Porta suburb of Rome.

After his traditional Sunday window appearance, the Pope visited a Roma community and urged them to integrate more in society 

Previously Francis has called on Roma gypsies to 'contribute to the common good.'

Earlier this year he acknowledged that they are often deprived of education and healthcare and viewed with 'hostility and suspicion' compelling reasons for this lack of participation in civic society.

But he said: 'The Gypsy people are also called on to contribute to the common good, and this is possible with adequate paths of shared responsibility, observing the obligations and promoting the rights of each one.'

Italy, which has one of the largest Roma populations outside Romania, has experienced problems between local and gypsy communities. 

In March hundreds fled one of the country's largest camps near Naples after a mob attacked them, following an alleged attempted rape of an Italian girl.

Elsewhere, a bakery in Rome was criticised for posting a sign in its window warning that access was 'strictly forbidden to gypsies'.  

The Pope has tried to hit out at prejudice against gypsies, urging people to stem their suspicion and calling on authorities to help those 'at the margins of society'.

In a series of off-the-cuff remarks in June, he said he has seen for himself the way in which parts of Italian society regarded them.

'I remember many occasions here in Rome where I would get on the bus and some Gypsies would get on too, and the driver would say: "Keep an eye on your wallets". This is scorn; it might be true, but it's scorn,' he said. 

In his comments, Francis acknowledged that the situation presented 'a complex reality'. But he emphasised social factors which he said led to many gypsies becoming susceptible to 'new forms of slavery' in society such as forced begging.
