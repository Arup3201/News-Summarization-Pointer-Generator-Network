David Cameron clashed with Francois Hollande over taxes and the European Union budget yesterday.

On his first trip to Downing Street as French President, Mr Hollande denounced Mr Cameron’s plea for French bankers to flee to the UK by boasting that France has a lower top rate of tax.

And he ditched predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy’s pledge to stand with Britain in seeking a real terms freeze to the EU budget.

Summit: David Cameron welcomes France's President Francois Hollande to Downing Street this afternoon

President Hollande met with the Queen at Windsor Castle yesterday following his meeting with David Cameron

The talks came as the European 
Commission demanded an extra £12billion be added to the planned 
£850billion EU budget for the period between 2014 and 2020, adding 
£1.5billion to the bill for British taxpayers, which was already 
expected to top £100billion.

Officials in Brussels said the 
increase was just a ‘mechanical exercise’ but the Treasury reacted with 
fury and demanded that the budget rise by no more than inflation. Mr 
Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘We both think the proposal on the 
table is unacceptable, we both recognise there is a need for restraint.’

But senior sources made clear that Mr
Hollande refused to support a deal which Mr Cameron and German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a year ago to oppose inflation-busting 
rises in the budget.

Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande held talks
and a working lunch lasting 95 minutes – an attempt to make up for Mr 
Cameron’s backing of Mr Sarkozy and his refusal to see Mr Hollande 
before his election.

Further tensions were evident at a 
press conference when the French president was asked about Mr Cameron’s 
pledge to ‘roll out the red carpet’ for French businessmen over the new 
leader’s pledge to increase the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent.

The visit to the UK was Monsieur Hollande's first official visit since taking office

Mr Hollande dismissed the furore as 
‘British humour’ but then pointedly added: ‘The top rate in Britain is 
45 per cent, in France it is 41 per cent. That does not induce British 
people to move to France – except for holiday homes.’

Mr Hollande could also not resist 
taking a dig at the banking scandal which has engulfed Barclays. He 
said: ‘There’s been indeed a few revelations in Britain which means we 
have to be wary in our respective countries and repressive even in some 
cases when faced with some behaviours from the banks.’

An unrepentant Mr Cameron made clear 
he wants to encourage people to move to the UK: ‘I want Britain to be 
the most competitive country in the world for people to grow a business,
to start a business, to employ people.

Lot to talk about: Mr Cameron caused dismay in France when he suggested he would 'roll out the red carpet' for any French business seeking to flee to Britain to escape higher taxes under the new president

‘I see it as my job to roll up my 
sleeves and every day ask “what more can I do to make Britain the best 
place, not just in Europe, but in the world to do business?”.’

Mr Cameron repeated his plan to offer
a referendum after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. 
Mr Hollande appeared to back the Prime Minister’s policy, acknowledging 
that a ‘two-speed’ Europe with the UK in the slow lane is now 
inevitable.

The French president said: ‘Britain 
does not wish to slow down or prevent the eurozone countries from 
acting. And France, within the eurozone, does not want to drag anyone to
join.’

Mr Cameron also welcomed an apparent 
change of heart on recent suggestions that British residents who own 
holiday homes in France could be hit with a new wave of taxes.

Mr Hollande ruled this out yesterday.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I have a 
press secretary who is half French, a chief of staff who has a French 
wife and an ambassador in Paris who has a home in Normandy. I’m sure 
he’ll be very relieved.’
