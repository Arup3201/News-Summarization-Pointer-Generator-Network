The tumultuous battle for the Republican presidential nomination took a dramatic twist last night when Rick Santorum won three stunning victories and delivered a major blow to Mitt Romney’s White House ambitions.

Speaking in St Charles, Missouri, Mr Santorum, former senator for Pennsylvania, declared: 'I don't stand here as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, I stand here as the conservative alternative to Barack Obama.'

Mr Santorum won by 30 points in Missouri. He beat Mr Romney into third place in Minnesota, behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the maverick libertarian.

And he added that 'conservatism is alive and well in Missouri and Minnesota' by declaring that on health care to 'Wall Street bailouts, Mitt Romney has the same positions as Barack Obama'.

Winner: Rick Santorum won by 30 points in Missouri. He beat Mitt Romney into third place in Minnesota, behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the maverick libertarian

In Colorado, where Mr Romney was a heavy favourite, Mr Santorum won by five points. The night was also a poor one for Newt Gingrich, who failed to get on the ballot in Missouri, finished fourth in Minnesota and a distant third in Colorado. 

He now finds his claim to be the only conservative who can beat Mr Romney seriously undermined.

Democrats will be buoyed by the results, which indicate a continuing and brutal primary battle that could seriously weaken Mr Romney if he emerges as the nominee or lead to the candidate facing President Barack Obama coming from the right wing of the Republican party.

The results of the contests, however, are only symbolic because no delegates were at stake.

The Romney campaign has insisted it is concentrating on amassing delegates and is unconcerned by 'beauty contests'. Mr Romney held only one event in Minnesota and did not campaign in Missouri.

Missouri:

Rick Santorum - 55%Mitt Romney - 25%Ron Paul - 12%

Colorado:

Rick Santorum - 40% Mitt Romney - 35%Newt Gingrich - 13%Ron Paul - 12%

Minnesota:

Rick Santorum - 45%Ron Paul - 27%Mitt Romney - 17%Newt Gingrich - 11%

Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Santorum said he thought the day could mark a turning point in the race. 'I feel great that Minnesota is going to change the direction of this race tonight,' he said in Blaine, Minnesota.

Mr Romney has committed time and financial resources to states across the country in preparation for 'Super Tuesday' on March 6 and retains a major financial advantage.

So it remained to be seen whether the night would be anything more than a temporary setback.

In a memo released yesterday morning, Rich Beeson, Mr Romney's political director, anticipating defeats, played down the day.

He
said: 'Of course, there is no way for any nominee to win first place in
every single contest. John McCain lost 19 states in 2008, and we expect
our opponents to notch a few wins too.'

After last night's results, Mr Santorum showed no sign of disappointment when speaking to supporters in Denver.

He said: 'This was a good night for Rick Santorum. I want to congratulate 
Senator Santorum, but I expect to become the nominee with your help.'

Missouri's
Republican Senator Roy Blunt, a Romney supporter, also congratulated 
the winner but highlighted that the delegates were still up for grabs.

He
said: 'Mitt Romney has the organisation and the resources to go the 
distance in this election, and I believe he'll ultimately win our 
party's nomination.'

As Lady Bracknell might
have remarked: "To lose a primary in Missouri, Mr Romney, may be
regarded as a misfortune; to lose a primary in Missouri and a caucus in
Minnesota looks like carelessness." And to lose a caucus in Colorado as
well is a real disaster.

This could have been the kind of script Oscar Wilde would have conjured up
for a Republican primary but it certainly wasn't the script that Mitt Romney
drafted.

On election night in Florida, after scoring an impressive 15-point victory
in Florida and trampling Newt Gingrich into the ground, the hope in Romneyworld
was that February would be a sweep with momentum and organisation carrying the
day.

Pounded: Mitt Romney is once again on the defensive after he was handed embarrassing defeats in three state Tuesday night

All that's changed now. A win in Minnesota or Missouri could have been
explained away as an aberration.

But Colorado was a state that Romney won by 60
points to 18 over John McCain in 2008 and where he campaigned and spent money
this time. Santorum won it by five points.

Beneficiary: President Barack Obama could be the real winner as the Republicans seemingly tear themselves apart

For Rick Santorum to win all three
states is a real stunner. What does it mean? Well, Romney remains the favourite but it's going to be a
long and brutal spring.

Rick Santorum should put his tin helmet on and prepare for a negative
barrage of the type Gingrich suffered in Florida. Romney's reference to
"those who have been compromised by the culture of Washington" is a
hint at a major line of attack - earmarks.

We'll doubtless hear a lot too about Santorum's 18-point drubbing in his
home (and swing) state of Pennsylvania in 2006. Money will flow to Santorum but
he will also attract a lot more scrutiny.

Romney is in a real bind though - the negative campaign he ran in Florida
was successful in the Sunshine State but clearly had serious ramifications
afterwards. Going to hard against Santorum, a much more likeable character than
Gingrich, could backfire.

Tonight is a serious blow for Romney but he's still the overwhelming
favourite to prevail. As Larry Sabato argues here, he's the only candidate with a national
organisation capable of grinding out the 1,144 delegates needed.

There were no actual delegates at stake tonight (though the delegates chosen
in Minnesota and Colorado wil closely reflect tonight's results ).

Disaster: Romney's camp predicted the end of the road for Newt Gingrich who fared even worse tonight, placing a distance third in Colorado and fourth in Minnesota

In Virginia
on Super Tuesday (March 6th), only Romney and Ron Paul are on the ballot. In
2008, Barack Obama prevailed over Hillary Clinton because he had a superior
strategy to net delegates. Romney is on track to do the same this time around.

Romney's chief strategist Stuart Stevens emailed me tonight: "Rather
win than lose but no delegates awarded and we're pretty tough minded about
these things. Focused on Super Tuesday and delegates." It's true that
Stevens always anticipated a bloody war of attrition and was focussed on
delegates from the get go.

But the margin of Santorum's victories in Missouri and Minnesota was
extraordinary. These were not just squeakers. In Missouri, Santorum won 55
percent of the vote compared to Romney's 25 percent - and 250,000
Republicans turned out. Romney was relegated to third place in Minnesota.

Trucking along: Ron Paul came in second in Minnesota, with 27 percent, but place third and fourth in Missouri and Colorado, respectively

Obviously, this speaks to considerable conservative doubt about Romney.
Certainly, the clear front runner can and often is punished by GOP voters,
as McCain was in 2008.

But it's a little bit early in this process to be taking
about any kind of buyer's remorse phenomenon - the sale hasn't yet been made.

Newt Gingrich is in real trouble. Stevens finished his email to me with:
"And it does really kill Newt, which is amusing."

Gingrich wasn't
organised enough to get on the ballot in Missouri and he finished fourth in
Minnesota and a distant third in Colorado. He's won one state and Santorum has
won four. He can no longer claim to be the principal
conservative alternative to Romney.

Ironically, Gingrich may be Romney's immediate saviour. His remaining in the
race (as he surely will) splits the conservative vote. The problem for both
Gingrich and Romney that the Newt vote really starts to tank. I wouldn't put it
past Romney to start praising Gingrich.

This should have been a bad week for Obama. He's made a disastrous
mistake by alienating the Catholic Church. He executed a stunning
U-turn today on super PACs. But all that has been eclipsed by tonight's
Santorum sweep.

The White House will still believe that Romney will be the ultimate nominee
but hope and expect that he will be seriously damaged in the process.
Their dream of dreams, of course, would be that Gingrich or Santorum somehow
emerge from this circus as the victor, judging that both are too far to the
Right to win in November.  

Romney may be counting on Super Tuesday but he's been thrown for a
loop by this Tuesday. For the time being at least, Loopy Tuesday means
that chaos will reign in this extraordinary GOP contest.
