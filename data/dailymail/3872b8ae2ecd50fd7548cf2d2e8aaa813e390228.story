First lived in more than two centuries before William the Conqueror set foot on British soil, this ancient house is believed to be the longest continually inhabited home in the south of England.

Dating back to 850, the Manor House in the pretty Wiltshire village of Downton, was once home to Sir Walter Raleigh, and is now for sale for £1.35million.

The Grade I-listed five-bedroom, four-bathroom house was originally founded as a chapel in 850, after which it was transformed into a medieval hall house, and subsequently into a comfortable country home.

The Raleigh family made substantial improvements to the house before Elizabeth I came to stay in 1586, and their coat of arms still stands over the fireplace

Sir Walter Raleigh, born in 1552, fought with the Huguenots in France, and later in Ireland, where his role in suppressing a Munster uprising brought him to the attention of Elizabeth I.He soon became one of her favourites and was rewarded with a knighthood in 1585

In 1591, Raleigh secretly married one of the queen's maids of honour, Elizabeth 'Bess' Throckmorton, who was 11 years younger and pregnant. Later Bess gave birth to their son, Damerei, but he died from the plague in 1592.When Elizabeth found out about Raleigh's unauthorised marriage, she was furious, and threw the couple into the Tower of London in June 1592. 

By this time Raleigh was back in favour with the queen, but this royal patronage expired with her death in 1603, . He was then accused of colluding with the Spanish in plotting against the king, Raleigh was sentenced to death. He spent the next 12 years writing the first volume of his 'History of the World' in the Tower.The adventurer was executed in October 1616 in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, after Raleigh had passed many opportunities to escape. His reputed last words, after being shown the axe that was to kill him, were 'Strike, man strike!'

In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I leased the house from Winchester College, giving it first to Thomas Wilkes, Clerk to the Privy Council, and then to her favourite, Raleigh.

In 1586 he invited the monarch to stay, but not before he made substantial improvements to the property, and the Raleigh family coat of arms still stands above the fireplace in the house's wooden panelled Great Parlour.

Another improvement by the Raleigh family, who lived at the house for about a century, was the addition of a first floor, created with wood from a ship which had been sailed up the River Avon and then dismantled.

Simon Jacobs, from Winkworth estate agent which is selling the Manor House, said: 'It is a wonderful family home with quite a history behind it.

'Even though it is a Grade I listed property, it still works well as a modern home and many reckon it's one of the longest privately lived in buildings in the area.

'The hall house was built in the 1400s, and it was the Raleighs who carried out a lot of the work on it.  They took a ship up the River Avon and then beached it before dismantling it and using the timber for the first floor and the staircase.

'It's a charming home and the timber underneath the chapel would have grown in the New Forest at around the time of the Conquest.'

Described 
as a 'special property which is perfect for entertaining', the Manor 
House is tucked away next to the church in a peaceful corner of the 
bustling village.

It
 comes with a 1.8 acre garden, which includes a walled kitchen garden, 
formal gardens, paddock, large barn and parking, and views over 
Cranborne Chase.

The
 village of Downton, which lies six miles outside Salisbury, has its own
 primary and secondary schools, shops, doctors and dentist, and even an 
annual Cuckoo Fair when children dance around a May pole.

Estate Agents Strutt and Parker says the property is 'exceptional accommodation that is both beautifully situated and full of character.'

The description continues: 'The principal reception rooms vary in style which has created a fascinating and eclectic blend of architectural styles, from the grand Tudor scale of the panelled Great Hall to the gothic study and the Regency proportions of the dining room.'

In addition, there is a cottage located in the grounds of the Manor House, with two bedrooms and two reception rooms.  

The dining room at the Manor House, which has views over the lawns, must have been host to some interesting questions over its long history
