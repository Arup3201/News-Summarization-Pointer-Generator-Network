Japanese trainer Naosuke Sugai believes never having won over a mile and a half is no barrier to Just A Way winning Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.

The five-year-old, rated the top racehorse in the world after his six-length romp in the Dubai Duty Free in March, heads a three-strong challenge from his country for Europe’s most prestigious all-age race.

But his only run at the distance resulted in an unplaced effort in the 2012 Japanese Derby and his only outing since Dubai was a win over a mile.

Japan's Sugai doesn't believe Find A Way's lack of form beyond a mile and a half is a hindrance 

Yuichi Goto of the Japanese Racing Association, said: ‘Just A Way’s ideal distance is one mile two furlongs but his trainer Mr Sugai, after Just A Way won by over six lengths in Dubai, is very confident he will adapt for the longer distance.’

Just A Way plus Harp Star, winner of Japan’s 1,000 Guineas and second in her country’s Oaks, and Gold Ship work at Chantilly racecourse on Wednesday.

Japan has gone close to winning the Arc, most notably when Orfevre handed the 2012 prize to outsider Solemia by hanging dramatically in the final furlong.

Hopes he could gain compensation 12 months ago were crushed by Treve. Just A Way (7-1), Harp Star (8-1) and Gold Ship (11-1) are all prominent in the betting to break their country’s duck.

Goto added: ‘Each has different characteristics. Just A Way has good speed, Gold Ship good stamina and Harp Star is the first three-year-old filly from Japan to run in the race.’

Twenty remain in the race, with Roger Charlton’s Al Kazeem an unexpected runner under James Doyle.

Frankie Dettori’s intended place on Aidan O’Brien’s Ruler of The World is unlikely be confirmed until the final declarations.
