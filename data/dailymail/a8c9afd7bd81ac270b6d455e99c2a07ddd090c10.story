Greg Eden turned in an inspirational display as Hull KR re-ignited their First Utility Super League play-off push with a comfortable 62-10 win over London Broncos.

Full-back Eden, who returned to the Rovers line-up after being dropped recently for disciplinary reasons, grabbed three tries, created another and proved a constant threat.

The 11-try win moves the Robins within a point of eighth-placed Widnes, while London's winless streak reached 22 games.

Three and easy: Greg Eden scored a hat-trick of tries as Hull KR swept aside London Broncos 62-10

The hosts made two changes from last weekend's defeat to St Helens, with Atelea Vea returning from suspension and Jordan Atkins from injury to replace Alex Foster and Joe Keyes.

Rovers made three changes of their own, with Eden, Ade Gardner and Connor Robinson coming in for former London star Omari Caro, Graeme Horne and Kris Keating.

The visitors, with just two wins to their name on the road prior to the clash, really should have taken an early lead when Travis Burns opened up the London defence, only for Liam Salter to refuse what would have been a try-scoring pass to David Hodgson.

But the Robins were on the board on nine minutes, Adam Walker's clever offload allowing Josh Hodgson to ease over at the posts.

The Broncos were mightily close to hauling themselves level with their first real assault three minutes later, only for skipper Matt Cook to be held inches short.

And that proved crucial when Rovers moved two scores ahead on 18 minutes, Eden shrugging off a poor tackle from Denny Solomona to gallop over.

Hull KR certainly had the edge in terms of skill and luck, grabbing a third try on 25 minutes when Craig Hall's apparently aimless kick bounced away from the London defence and allowed Kevin Larroyer to touch down.

By now the visitors were easing through the gears, Eden grabbing his second try eight minutes before the break when he showed a clean pair of heels to the Broncos defence to race home from distance.

There was still time in the half for one final Rovers score, Burns booting a penalty to give the visitors a 26-0 interval advantage.

It was more of the same after the break, Salter adding a fifth try moments after the restart when he raced the length of the field to score after intercepting a loose London pass.

The Broncos finally gave their long-suffering fans something to cheer on 47 minutes, Atkins squeezing in at the corner after Josh Drinkwater looped a pass outside the Rovers defence.

That proved brief respite though, the Robins moving 36-4 ahead when Mick Weyman pounced to score after the London defence stood and watched Eden's grubber through.

Next to score was Gardner, profiting with an easy finish after Kris Welham had broken the Broncos defensive line.

An eighth try duly arrived on 63 minutes, Adam Walker bursting home from close range.

The men from the capital were able to conjure a second score, Atkins again after good work from Ben Farrar.

But Rovers were soon to pass the 50-point barrier as firstly Weyman added his second after a flat pass from Burns, with Salter adding a second of his own on 75 minutes after a David Hodgson break.

The final word fittingly went to Eden, completing his hat-trick of tries after strong play from Burns, who failed to add the extras but still scored 18 points with his boot.
