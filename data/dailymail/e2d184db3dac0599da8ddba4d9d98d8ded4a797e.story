A Russian ice hockey star has been dropped from away games for the next three weeks after his Yorkshire terrier ate his travel documents.

Anatoly Golyshev, who plays for Russian Premier league club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg, had left the paperwork including his passport at home when he left the house.

The 19-year-old had not taken his dog with him and it is believed the animal vented its frustration  by eating the documents. 

Ruff justice: Russian ice hockey player Anatoly Golyshev has been dropped by his club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg for three weeks after his dog ate his passport

He said: 'When I got home, I saw that the dog was chewing on something. 

'I couldn't believe it when I realised it was my passport that he was gnawing and he had already taken a big chunk out of it.'

The club plays in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), an international professional ice hockey league founded in 2008 which has member clubs based in Belarus, Croatia, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia, and Slovakia.

As a result, there are a lot of away games for the team.

Until new paperwork can be organised, Golyshev has to stay at home in the Russian city of Sverdlovsk Oblast.

The press officer for the club, Alexey Galanov, confirmed they had done everything they could to get new documents, but that so far it was looking like it would take about three weeks to get the paperwork back.

After that, he said, the player would be able to continue his career as usual.

He is an important player for his team in the national league as he has scored 13 times in last 26 matches.

The league is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in Europe and Asia and the World behind the NHL.
