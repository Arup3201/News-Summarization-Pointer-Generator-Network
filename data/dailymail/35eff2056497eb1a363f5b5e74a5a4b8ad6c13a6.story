Just hours after the nation was rocked by news of a mass shooting in Washigton’s Navy Yard, a politician in Russia shocked them once more by mocking the tragedy before a death toll had even been tallied.

Alexei Pushkov took to Twitter Monday morning and used Obama’s words from a speech on the Syria crisis to ridicule Americans in the wake of the tragedy in the capital.

‘A new shootout at Navy headquarters in Washington – a lone gunman and 7 corpses. Nobody’s even surprised anymore,’ Pushkov tweeted two hours after shots first rang out. ‘A clear confirmation of American exceptionalism.’

Thoughtless: Russian parliament member Alexei Pushkov mocked Monday's Navy Yard shooting as a 'clear indication of American exceptionalism' just hours after shots rang out in Washington

As the New York Post points out, 
Pushkov, a member of the Russian parliament’s foreign affairs committee 
was likely referencing a comment made by the president last week.

‘That’s
what makes us exceptional,’ Obama said. ‘With humility, but with 
resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.’

Obama was urging Americans to support a strike on Syria as a means of halting its human rights violations.

But the Russian politician used the words to mock Americans.

Twisting words: Last week, Obama called America's willingness to end human rights violations in Syria using military intervention 'what makes us exceptional'

‘The
USA should part with the notion of American exceptionalism,’ Pushkov 
tweeted about an hour later. ‘It contradicts the principles of equal 
rights and smells of political racism.’

This is not Pushkov’s first swipe at America, nor is it his first foray onto the international stage, though his timing and methods leave him more wide open for criticism than ever before.

Pushkov, who is seen as especially close with the Kremlin, was among the most vocal in Russia during NSA leaker Edward Snowden’s prolonged stay at a Moscow airport.

Snowden was eventually granted asylum in Russia, but not before Pushkov got in his jabs—at Snowden and America.

Bad timing: Pushkev's comments came as the death toll was still rising from the Washington Navy Yard shooting he mocked. As of Monday afternoon, 12 people were counted among the dead

Pushkov at one point became annoyed with Snowden’s prolonged citizenship limbo.

He joked that if Snowden does not find shelter in Venezuela, 'he will have to stay and marry Anna Chapman,' the redheaded Russian spy who was among 10 sleeper agents deported from the United States in 2010.

At another point in the saga, reports mistakenly suggested Snowden has left Russia and the U.S. demanded to know his whereabouts.

'Why should the United States expect restraint and understanding from Russia,’ Pushkov mocked at the time.

On Monday, Pushkov again showed no restraint when he used the occasion of a deadly shooting to make a political point.

The death count at the Washington Navy Yard continued to rise after the Parliamentarian's comments. As of Monday afternoon, the death count was 12.
