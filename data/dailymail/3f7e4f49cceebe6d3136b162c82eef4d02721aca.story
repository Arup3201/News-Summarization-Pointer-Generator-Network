USA have a terrific opportunity to make the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 12 years when they take on Belgium on Tuesday.

Jurgen Klinsmann's side progressed from this summer's 'Group of Death' - as referenced by president Barack Obama this week - by beating Ghana and drawing against Portugal.

While this isn't the most gifted American team of recent years, particularly without the goalscoring Landon Donovan, the manager has them well-drilled and they are uniting a country.

The main man: America have looked to Clint Dempsey for their supply of goals in recent years

Who are the danger men?

Clint Dempsey is the talismanic figure up front for America and has scored twice in the tournament so far. The Seattle Sounders man isn't usually a striker but has played on his own under Klinsmann in the absence of more attackers.

American supporters should watch out for Eden Hazard for Belgium. The forward lit up the Premier League at Chelsea over the last year and poses a serious threat with his direct dribbling and intelligence on the ball.

The USA central midfield pairing of Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones have Bundesliga experience in Germany and work hard, while Tim Howard has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in Europe over the last five years.

The managers

Klinsmann and Belgium boss Marc Wilmots are two of the best players of their generation. Wilmots was a central midfielder and capped by the European side on 70 occasions, while the America boss played for Germany 80 times, scoring an impressive 38 goals.

How did Belgium get here?

Wilmots guided his team to three wins out of three in Group H - even though they weren't at their best.

The Belgians have a host of talent who play in the English Premier League, including Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham) and Vincent Kompany (Manchester City).

They beat Algeria 2-1 thanks to goals by Marouane Fellaini (Manchester United) and Dries Mertens (Napoli) before a late winner by teenager Divock Origi (Lille) crushed Russia.

The group winners were already through by the time Vertonghen scored the only goal against South Korea.

Head-to-head

The only time Belgium have lost competitively to USA was in the 1930 World Cup, when they went down 3-0.

They last met in May 2013, which ended in a 3-2 defeat for America. Everton's Kevin Mirallas and Fellaini scored as well as a brace from Christian Benteke. Geoff Cameron and Dempsey found the net for America.

The American WAGs

Dempsey's wife Bethany has a masters degree and is an educational psychologist - as well as posing for a Sports Illustrated shoot in 2011. Bradley has been married to Amanda Barletta  for three years, while Matt Bresler posts pictures of himself and wife Amanda on his instagram account.

Belgium skipper Kompany also got wed in 2011 to wife Carla, while creative midfielder Axel Witsel is said to be engaged to Szabo Rafaella.
