Thieves attempted to snatch supermodel Naomi Campbell’s handbag as she sat in a limousine in central Paris, French police confirmed tonight.

Revelations about the attack last November came following claims about a ‘violent mugging’ which saw the supermodel end up in a wheelchair.

There were reports that the 42-year-old had been attacked just before Christmas as she tried to hail a taxi in the French capital.

In fact she was already sitting in the car when two men on a motorbike are said to have tried to grab her handbag on November 21.

The attempted snatch took place in Rue de Moussy, in the trendy Marais district of central Paris, just off the Rue de Rivoli.

Nothing was taken, but Ms Campbell filed a complaint at the nearby police station of the 4th arrondissement.

There she refused to have a medical examination, but was later pictured in a wheelchair and wearing a brace.

Sources in New York later claimed Ms Campbell had suffered a torn leg ligament in the bag snatch.

A spokesman for Naomi Campbell responded with 'no comment' when asked about the attack.

The 42-year-old's billionaire boyfriend, Vladimir Doronin, used his private jet to fly her to Vail, Colorado, where she was treated by J. Richard Steadman, one of the world's leading orthopedic surgeons.

Following a check of November crime reports in Paris, a police source said: ‘On November 21, two people on a motorbike attempted to steal Ms Campbell's handbag as she sat in a vehicle on Rue de Moussy.

‘She filed a complaint with police in the 4th arrondissement but she did not agree to a medical examination.’

The source said Ms Campbell was ‘accompanied’ during her ordeal, and had wisely stayed inside the car.

There were indications that she was worried that the motorbike riders had deliberately targeted her and might strike again.

‘This was the main reason she reported the crime,’ said the source.

Muggings are comparatively rare in 
Paris, although sneak thieves do operate around the poorer suburbs, and 
at crowded Metro and train stations.

Ms Campbell, however, is known for her five star lifestyle when she is in the city, usually staying in a 1000 pounds plus a night suite at the hugely luxurious Bristol Hotel, and travelling everywhere by chauffer driven car.

Ms Campbell’s representatives have refused to comment on the affair.

The New York Post reported French police are currently investigating the incident, and have apparently asked the model not to speak publicly about her ordeal.

Over the past few weeks, the model has maintained a cheery online presence, tweeting a series of uplifting messages to welcome in the New Year.

The attack was not the first time Ms Campbell has been involved in an incident of violence.

She has often been accused of physically abusing members of her staff - in 2000, she admitted throwing a mobile phone at her personal assistant, and in 2007 she was ordered to carry out community service after assaulting her housekeeper.

Four years ago, Ms Campbell was banned from flying on British Airways for spitting at two policemen during an argument at Heathrow airport.

The model has been dating Mr Doronin, 50, for nearly five years - even though he is still married to his Russian wife, from whom he has been estranged for over a decade.

Ms Campbell threw him a lavish birthday party in India in November, but once again got in trouble with the law when her events manager was arrested over claims the event had produced too much noise.
