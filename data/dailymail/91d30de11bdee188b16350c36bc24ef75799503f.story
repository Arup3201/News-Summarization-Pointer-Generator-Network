Inseparable: Tasha Bradford and Sylvester Storey wed in Florida October 19, but only a week later the newlyweds were involved in a tragic crash that killed the husband and left the wife badly injured

Tasha Bradford and Sylvester Storey's fairy-tale romance ended just over a week after their wedding when the Florida newlyweds got into a rollover crash that killed the young husband and cost his wife a leg.

Tasha and Sylvester, better known to his loved ones as a 'Buck,' tied the knot in Panama City, Florida, on October 19 and set out for their honeymoon in the mountains of Tennessee.

As the newlyweds were driving home in the early hours of October 27, the Storeys were involved in an accident on Interstate 85 in La Grange, Georgia.

Sylvester Storey was pronounced dead on the scene. His 31-year-old wife was airlifted in critical condition to Grady Hospital in Atlanta, where doctors amputated her badly injured right leg and removed a portion of her damaged colon.  

‘The day that we got there, she was swollen. She has a neck brace. She had tubes in her mouth. She couldn't even speak,’ Tori Cooper, Tasha's sister-in-law, recalled to WMBB.

On Wednesday, Tasha's friends and family finally got some good news: the 31-year-old woman will be transferred to a hospital in her hometown of Panama City to continue her recovery.

The tragic tale of the Storeys' love and loss has struck a chord with people across the country, who took to an online fundraising account on GoFundMe set up by the couple's church acquaintance to help out with Tasha's mounting medical bills and her husband’s final expenses.

So far, more than 220 people have donated just over $12,000 - a fraction of the $1million goal.

Despite her misfortunes, the 31-year-old widow insisted from her hospital bed that she is blessed.

When Tasha was rushed to the intensive care unit with her right leg mangled beyond repair, she recalled having a dream in which her dead husband appeared at the site of the crash that killed him.

‘He said, “I can't stay, but I just want to tell you goodbye, and I love you,"’ she told CNN. ‘God has a greater plan than I'll ever know. I know with time and healing, he'll send someone my way who will love me for me.’

For Tasha and ‘Buck’ Storey, their union was a match made in heaven. From the very first date, the two bonded over their Christian faith and love of the 'Star Trek' franchise.

This past May, the Florida couple got engaged after two years of dating, and five months later they exchanged their vows at High Praise Worship Center in Callaway.

Before walking down the aisle, the bridal party held a prayer asking God to bless them.

'He [Storey] said "she made me wait 
two years before she said yes to marry me, but I would have waited 20 if
I got her at the end,"' Pastor Joshua Gay, who officiated the 
October 19 ceremony, told the station. 'They just really loved each other.'

During
the nuptials, Tasha and Sylvester read aloud letters they had written 
for each other and took communion before sealing their union with a 
kiss.

Afterwards, Mr and 
Mrs Storey drove to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, for their honeymoon – a week 
that was supposed to be a joyful prologue for a long life together.

The
couple revelled in their newfound happiness, visiting the Hollywood Wax
Museum, sitting in a small café over cups
of cocoa and watching a football game together.

On
the morning of October 27, the Storeys woke up in the dark and hit 
the road in their 2001 Chevrolet Blazer SUV en route to Panama City, 
which they were hoping to reach in time for the evening prayer service 
at their church.

Tasha was 
curled up in a blanket in the backseat of their unheated car. She 
remembers her husband urging her to take a nap and promising her, 'I'll 
be OK.' Sylvester also said that he loved her, not knowing it would be 
the last time he uttered those words.

No
one is quite sure what happened next, but Tasha later remembered being awakened by the 
lurching motion of the SUV rolling on the highway. When she looked down,
the 31-year-old professional photographer saw that her right leg was 
badly injured.

With the vehicle flipped upside down, Tasha Storey was unable to free herself from the seatbelt and began screaming for help.

Several
Good Samaritan came to her aid and extracted Tasha from the car, 
covering her with blankets until first responders arrived and took her 
to a hospital in Atlanta.

It wasn't until Tasha was in the ER that a nurse broke it to her that her husband’s didn't make it.

‘I
knew God had his side because he was such a good, Christian man,’ Mrs 
Storey recalled. ‘I had no doubt where he was going to go.’

What followed next was a series of emergency surgeries to severe her fractured right leg and remove a length of colon that had died from lack of blood supply.

Tasha Storey has a long road ahead of her. She will have to undergo months of physical therapy before she is fitted with a prosthetic leg.

The young widow does not despair. She even jokingly nicknamed her stump Jack in honor of a character from the animated classic 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.'

‘It's so inspiring to watch someone in the face of such tragedy, remain so positive and remain so up,’ said Pastor Gay.
