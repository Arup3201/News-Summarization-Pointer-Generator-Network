A fraud gang duped investors into buying diamonds for twenty times their value before using the £1.5m profit to fund lavish shopping sprees in Selfridges, Louis Vuitton and Harrods, a court has heard.

Victims were allegedly lured into the 'boiler room' scam by 'persistent and persuasive' salesmen who told them the limited coloured stones would pay handsome returns because they were from mines which were closed or closing. 

But those involved had allegedly valued the yellow diamonds at more than 2000 per cent their worth, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Rommell Brown, 31, (left) and Anna Foord, 20, (right) are among the two defendants accused of orchestrating a 'boiler room' scam by allegedly persuading investors to buy coloured diamonds at twenty times their value

The bank accounts for the two companies through which the sales were made were also haemorrhaging cash on luxury goods, the court heard.

More than £2,000 was splurged in Hugo Boss, while £2,100 was spent in Louis Vuitton. It also showed that £7,685 was spent in Selfridges and £1,240 in exclusive department store Harrods.

Nearly £3,000 was blown in a New York department store in a single day, the court heard.

Rommell Brown, 31, Billy Cosma, 23, Anna Foord, 30, Anton Howell, 28, and Farouq Eshpari, 55, all from London or the south east, are standing trial but deny conspiracy to defraud.

Farouq’s sons Omar Eshpari, 34, and Hider Esphari, 28, have admitted conspiracy to defraud while wife Safia Eshpari, 52, admitted concealing, disguising and removing criminal property.

Prosecutor Esther Schutzer-Weissman said investors racked up £1.5m losses after paying for precious gems through Evolution Commodities Limited and Stonehouse Global Markets Limited.

She told the jury: ‘It was a stone to be used as an asset for investment. The caller was persuasive, the caller was persistent and always suggesting to the investor that purchasing coloured diamonds was an investment that would get good and reliable returns.

‘They were told often that diamonds would be scarcer and rarer and therefore more valuable because a mine, or mines, were closing or had closed.

Billy Cosma, 23 (left) is also accused of conspiracy to defraud. Hider Esphari, 28 (right) admitted the charge at Southwark Crown Court 

‘They were told this was a limited time opportunity and they were told that the investment was guaranteed to provide a good return, depending of course on how long the diamond was kept before selling on.

‘Calls would be followed by letters that provided more concrete information about the investment prospect of the stones.’

She told the court how a certificate was sent for each purchased diamond, giving details of clarity and cut.  But, crucially, the certificate did not include the value, the court heard. 

Many clients also took up the offer of free storage from the company, said Ms Schutzer-Weissman.

The court was told how one investor allegedly duped the by scam was telephoned by Hider Eshpari.

Using an alias, he told him it was an ‘exciting market for coloured diamonds’ and offered to send him a brochure.

A short time later, he received more phone calls from Evolution telling him there was fantastic potential for investment and that a mine was closing in Australia, it is alleged.

The client visited the company offices in August 2011 and agreed to buy a round brilliant orange brown diamond weighing 0.28 carats. He paid £5,550 for the stone after finding out it was one of the last they had in stock, jurors heard.

Later that month he visited again and purchased an orange yellow diamond weighing 0.31 carats for £14,450.

Hider Eshpari told him its worth would rocket at Chinese New Year when demand for the diamonds increased.

But the first gem was worth only £270 and the second just £440.

Ms Schutzer-Weissman said: ‘Those figures are not disputed - when I said there was a big mark up, those are the types of mark up we are thinking about.

‘It is agreed the diamonds sold by Evolution are worth far less than they were sold for.’ 

She added: ‘You may think that the business was being run as a cash cow for these defendants.

‘These defendants were aware that the benefits they receives were not as a result of business acumen but as a result of intentional and persistent fraud.'

Brown, 39, from Edmonton, north London and Howell, 26, from Chigwell, Essex, both deny two charges of conspiracy to defraud.

Cosma, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex denies a single charge of conspiracy to defraud.

Foord, from Elstree, Hertfordshire, denies two charges of conspiracy to defraud and a further charge of money laundering.

Farouq Eshpari, from  Enfield, Middlesex, also denies a charge of money laundering.

Omar and Hider Eshpari, of the same address, have admitted two counts of conspiracy to defraud while Safia, also at the address, admitted money laundering.

The trial, which is expected to run for six weeks, continues.
