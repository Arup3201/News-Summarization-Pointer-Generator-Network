A bench-clearing brawl during a women's college basketball game on Saturday  ended the contest before the winner of the Southwestern Athletic Conference regular-season title could be crowned.

Texas Southern trailed Southern by two points at TSU's H&PE Arena in Houston, Texas, with 12:37 left in the second half when the brawl broke out. 

SU was leading 51-49 when TSU's Miracle Davis took a charge underneath her basket.

Southern and Texas Southern were playing at H&PE Arena on Saturday when a massive brawl broke out

The two teams began fighting after TSU's Miracle Davis took a charge underneath her team's basket

The physical play prompted the melee to begin between the players, but it spread to include fans and cheerleaders as well.

TSU's Alexus Johnson and Diamonisha Sophus threw punches during the fight, the Advocate reported. 

Johnson was so heated, security officers had to prevent her from entering the SU locker room.

Footage of the fight was captured by a cellphone. 

SU coach Sandy Pugh said he had never seen such an 'embarrassment' in more than 30 years of being involved with basketball. 

He said. 'I just saw two kids standing up looking at each other, and someone else push and yell.

'My first reaction is to tell everyone to stay on the bench. But I look up and TSU has two kids running in.

'One of their kids throws the first punch, and one of our kids was on the ground and someone was just pounding her. Next thing I know, it was a melee.'

Officials ruled the game ended in a double forfeit, but the SWAC later decided SU, which is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, won and both teams would share a piece of the regular-season title. 

SU athletic director Dr. William Broussard said: 'I haven't reviewed the film as much as I'd like, but my initial response is that there was a significant show of and attempt at restraint on the part of our bench as the melee unfolded,

'At a certain point it's difficult to distinguish whether or not we interacted out of aggression or to defend teammates as Texas Southern's game-day staff and security personnel attempted to respond.'

If both teams advance in the SWAC tournament, they could meet in the conference final over the weekend

The SWAC women's tournament starts on Tuesday but TSU and SU won't play until Wednesday.

The TSU Lady Tigers are then No. 1 seed and the SU Lady Jaguars are seeded second. 

If both teams advance, they could meet in the conference final over the weekend.  

 TSU athletic director Charles McClelland said: 'At Texas Southern University we hold our student-athletes to high standards in regards to sportsmanship and personal conduct.

'An unfortunate incident occurred during the second half of our women's basketball with Southern University that undoubtedly does not reflect the core values and principles that we expect our student-athletes to exhibit at all times. 

'Both institutions along with the conference office are in the process of reviewing the incident and gathering additional information.'

 SU will share a piece of the SWAC's regular-season title with TSU after winning the game by two points
