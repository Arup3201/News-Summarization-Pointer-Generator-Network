Suspended but not struck off: Dr Judith Ames, 52, with new husband Robert Owens, 66, pictured together today, who got together just days after his wife, her patient, died of cancer

A GP who began an affair with the husband of one of her patients just days after his wife died from cancer has been banned from practising medicine for six months.

Dr Judith Ames sobbed yesterday at the verdict, as she was branded ‘entirely selfish’ and told to ‘reflect on her behaviour’.

Dr Ames had been a regular visitor to Joyce Owens, 69, in the days leading up to her death, but within two weeks she had moved in with 66-year-old widower Robert. The couple married in September.

Lawyers for the mother-of-three argued she should escape punishment usually targeted at doctors who prey on vulnerable patients to satisfy their own sexual appetite. Yesterday, however, the 52-year-old GP was handed the six-month ban – just a step down from being struck off.

Afterwards the dead woman’s brother – who previously branded the affair a ‘betrayal’ of her memory – told the Daily Mail that Dr Ames had brought her professional disgrace upon herself.

‘The past 20 months since my sister died have been extremely difficult for the family and particularly for our 91-year old mother, who is in poor health,’ Colin Mason, 59, said.

‘Dr Ames’ actions and those of Robert Owens have been entirely selfish, with no thought for the effect they had on the other members of Joyce’s family.’

Thanking the General Medical Council for its ‘thorough investigation’ of the case, he added: ‘I feel a sense of satisfaction that the behaviour of Dr Ames and Robert Owens have been exposed to the public at large and without the work of the GMC this would not have been possible.’ 

Dr Ames was working at the Mannamead surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens went for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness. She was later diagnosed with lung cancer.

Tragic: Joyce Owens, late wife of Robert Owens, who was treated by Dr Judith Ames as she died of a terminal illness last year

Over the following ten months, Dr Ames made regular trips to the couple’s home, up until Mrs Owens’ death in March last year.

Within two weeks Dr Ames had left her
 teacher husband and was sharing the marital bed, agreeing to marry Mr 
Owens days later.

Dr Ames informed partners at her practice that she was
 in a relationship with Mr Owens, who was a patient there but hadn’t 
been treated by her.

She resigned after they accused her of breaching 
conduct guidelines and the case was referred to the GMC.

Risk: The doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and the governing body but was prepared to do so to be with Mr Owens

Treatment: Dr Ames was a doctor at Mannamead Surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens was diagnosed with cancer

Request: Dr Ames called the General Medical Council herself to discuss the implications of her relationship

Earlier this year the Medical 
Practitioners Tribunal Service ruled she was guilty of misconduct 
because she ‘transgressed fundamental rules governing the doctor-patient
 relationship’.

The General Medical Council, 
represented by Simon Phillips QC, had called for the doctor to be struck
 off.

But at yesterday’s hearing in Manchester, panel chairman Gareth 
Davies said Dr Ames presented no risk to patients and would be unlikely 
to repeat her behaviour.

However, he rejected submissions that the 
earlier ruling was punishment enough and suspended her from practising 
for six months. The suspension was postponed for four weeks so she could
 complete a stint as locum at another surgery in Plymouth.

Mr Davies said that as well as 
showing her actions were considered unacceptable, a six-month suspension
 would give her ‘the opportunity to reflect further on your conduct and 
the standards of behaviour expected of you as a medical professional’.

Afterwards Dr Ames told the Daily 
Mail: ‘I accept the outcome graciously as a professional lady.’ She 
declined to comment further.

Following the original hearing, the 
Mail told how Mrs Owens’ family had slammed the ‘indecent haste’ with 
which the couple began their relationship.

Her first husband, who didn’t want to
 be named, claimed she left him, taking their two daughters with her, 
because Mr Owens was ‘younger, had a degree, a good job and money’.

He added: 'Hurtful comments made by 
Dr Ames that we were not a close family only added to our pain as did 
those made by Joyce’s first husband, who took the opportunity of this 
case to make a series of unfounded allegations against Joyce.

‘This
 action says more about his own bitterness. I had hoped he would find 
solace in his subsequent marriages but this has clearly not been the 
case.’
