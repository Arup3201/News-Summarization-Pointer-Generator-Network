A judge's racially insensitive Christmas email may derail his nomination to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

An email that Judge Thomas Kistler, 57, forwarded to 22 friends and colleagues shows a black man in an orange jumpsuit and woman on opposite sides of a prison visitation phone with the message 'Merry Christmas from the Johnsons'.

A message included in the Centre County judge's email said 'Touching and heartwarming. Merry Christmas to ALL! JK'.

A 2013 email from Centre County, Pennsylvania, Judge Thomas Kistler contained this offensive image and the subject line 'Best Christmas card ever' 

The judge said that he sometimes uses the abbreviation JK, which often stands for 'Just kidding', to mean 'Judge Kistler'.

The subject line of the December 2013 message, which had pictures of Santa, was 'Best Christmas card ever'.

The image of the black man and woman is believed to be a normal photo that was put into a Christmas card format by Internet users. 

Members of the criminal justice system including prosecutors and members of the probation department received it, according to the Centre Daily Times.

Judge Kistler, a Republican who has been a judge in Centre County since 1997, confirmed that he had shared the email but that it was not racist.

He said  that 'The last thing I would do would be to express some racial bias and send it to 20 friends'.

'It was a comment about how lightly people take being incarcerated.' 

The judge had told the Philadelphia Inquirer Thursday night that he did not remember sending the email and that  it did not sound like something he would say. 

He interpreted it as saying 'Christmas goes on, even for the people we put in jail'.

'I don't think it conveys humor at all. I don't find that humorous,' he said.

Governor Tom Wolf (pictured) nominated Judge Kistler for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court but now said he is reviewing the controversy caused by the email

The email may cause trouble for his nomination to the state's highest court. 

Democratic governor Tom Wolf had reached across the political aisle to nominate Judge Kistler along with a member of his own party to fill two vacancies until an election later this year.

One of the empty positions on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was vacated because a previous justice resigned amid a scandal over emails he sent and received that allegedly contained pornographic material.

Judge Kistler said he did not think the headlines he has made because of his email will affect the confirmation process, which he has a hearing for Tuesday. 

Governor Wolf said through a spokesperson that he 'does not condone that email or emails like it' but was waiting to gather more facts about the controversy, according to The Patriot News.

One of the Pennsylvania legislature's powerful African-American members, Democratic Sen. Vincent Hughes of Philadelphia, said that the email image was troubling and offensive, a spokesman said.
