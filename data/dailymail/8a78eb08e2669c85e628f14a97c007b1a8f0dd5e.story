The families of dozens of dead children whose names were stolen for use in undercover missions will never be told, police revealed yesterday.

The ‘Day of the Jackal’ deception was branded ‘morally repugnant’ by one chief constable who said Scotland Yard hijacked the identities of up to 61 children.

In a disturbing twist, the review revealed that a secret 2002 inquiry discovered 1,200 passport applications for dead children had been made.

Revelations: The review said that the use of dead children's identities was common practice among police forces and security agencies

The high number could mean that criminals, as well as police and spy agencies, were also using the tactic to forge new lives.

Chief constable Mick Creedon apologised to families who have complained but said they would never know for certain if their children's identities were used

Mick Creedon apologised to grieving 
relatives but said they can never know for certain because of the risk 
to the lives of former spies if they are ‘outed’.

The Derbyshire Chief Constable admitted the 
controversial practice was probably far more widespread and was 
sanctioned at the ‘highest level’.

Unveiling his report into the 
scandal, Mr Creedon said it was commonplace among highly secretive 
police units for at least 35 years.

He said: ‘The people working from 1968 onwards were doing so in a very different environment and times.

‘They made the operational decision to use this tactic because it was necessary to protect their operatives.

‘Some of those deployments were at 
the top end and extremely sensitive. Undercover officers in the UK have 
been subjected to serious harm and beatings.

‘Overseas, officers from other 
agencies have been murdered. If they are going to go into groups of this
calibre you have got to give them the backstop of cover.

‘It is not some kind of salacious and
immoral use of identities - it was seen at the time as operationally 
necessary and justified.’

Revelations that police stole the 
identities of dead children to help them infiltrate criminal gangs and 
protest groups provoked outrage two years ago.

A way in: Dead children's identities were used by undercover offices to infiltrate violent gangs and demonstration groups

Scotland Yard announced an 
independent review would take place to examine the scale of the tactic 
and whether it was unlawful. It discovered that the names of at least 42
children who died between the ages of four and eight were stolen up 
until 2003.

The provenance of a further 19 
identities remains under investigation and the total figure is likely to
be far higher as the tactic was also used by other forces and spy 
agencies.

Between 1968 and 2008 a total of 106 
false identities were created, of which 45 were entirely fictitious. 
Police now use different methods to create fake personas.

The report examined tactics by 
members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) and the National Public
Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU).

The SDS was created in 1968 in 
response to violent protests against the Vietnam War and went on to 
investigate animal rights protesters and other extremist groups.

Mr Creedon said hand-picked officers 
developed their own tactics, recording their best ideas in an informal 
book known as the ‘Trade Craft Manual’.

He said their work was conducted amid
conditions of ‘extreme secrecy’ and was given the green light at the 
‘highest levels’ of Government and policing.

Apology: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said sorry for the 'shock and offence' caused

The units were directly funded by the
Home Office because of thirst for intelligence among top politicians 
about the activities of dissident groups.

Speaking about his experience, one 
former head of Special Branch said: ‘It was for Queen and country and 
peace and democracy. It was the way it was done.’

Police were inspired by the film, The Day of the Jackal

Families who suspected their 
children’s names may have been used by police reacted with anger to the 
police decision to keep their activities secret.

Lawyer Jules Carey, who represents 
Barbara Shaw who fears her son Rod Richardson’s name was used, said she 
feels her concerns have been ‘swept under the carpet’.

He said: ‘What we heard was not an 
apology but a PR exercise. The families of the dead children whose 
identities have been stolen by the undercover officers deserve better 
than this.

‘They deserve an explanation, a 
personal apology and, if appropriate, a warning of the potential risk 
they face, in the exceptional circumstances, that their dead child’s 
identity was used to infiltrate serious criminal organisations.’

Mrs Shaw and a further 14 families 
who suspected the identities of their children may have been used will 
receive personal apologies from the Met.

The first use of a dead child’s 
identity in a spy operation was in 1943 when a corpse carrying false 
documents was planted off the coast of Spain to dupe German forces.

In 1971 it was popularised by 
thriller author Fredrick Forsyth as it became an accepted practice for 
undercover officers who chose their own new names from official records.

A wider multi-million pound inquiry into a host of allegations against undercover officers may not report for another two years.

A series of former Home Secretaries, 
Met commissioners and top civil servants face being questioned amid 
claims some officers fathered children with their targets.

Officials are also investigating 
claims the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence were smeared by 
police and allegations undercover officers lied on oath.

Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised for the ‘shock and offence’ caused by the ‘Day of the Jackal’ tactic.

He said: ‘I believe the public do 
understand the necessity for police and others to do things like this to
protect against a much greater harm.

‘It was never intended or foreseen 
that any of the identities used would become public, or that any family 
would suffer hurt as a result.’
