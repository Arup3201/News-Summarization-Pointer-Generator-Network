One of Britain's oldest ever naturally conceiving mothers says she has no regrets about keeping her baby.

Debbie Hughes hit the headlines when she fell pregnant with son, Kyle, in 2010 when she was 53.

Now aged 57, she says having a toddler is challenging but she wouldn't want her life to be any different.

'He's four in June, he's a handful but he's lovely,' she said on today's Lorraine. 

'He's younger than my two granddaughters who are five and six so he's their uncle but they will grow up more like cousins.'

On how she copes as an older mother, Debbie, from Daventry, Northamptonshire, said: 'I act younger and feel younger, I keep myself trim. 

'There's no downside, to me it's no different. I have been a mum since 1979 so I never had an empty nest. Just when I think they are growing up I've had another one as I have massive age gaps between them all. It's normal for me.' 

The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that more women than ever are having babies later in life in order to focus on their education and careers. 

The statistics show that double the number of women are now having babies over the age of 35 than they were in 1990, despite it being the time when fertility is said to plummet.

The number of over-50s giving birth has more than doubled in the past five years, with three children every week in Britain born to a mother in this age group.

Debbie told Lorraine Kelly she copes with her toddler by 'acting younger and keeping trim'

Debbie, a jewellery assistant, said she had no plans to become a mother again when she fell pregnant at 53 with her then partner Paul Clarke, 47, a heavy goods vehicle driver, as she had been on the Pill.

At the time, she already had two sons Mark, 26, and Brandon, 11. She also had a daughter, Hayley, who died tragically just a week before her 18th birthday.

Debbie is also grandmother to Mark's daughters - Lydia, now five, and Nicole, now six.

On falling pregnant, Debbie told Lorraine Kelly: 'It just happened, I started noticing weight around my tummy and couple of people pointed it out. 

'I thought I can't be pregnant, not at my age. I got a test and then another one and another one - four in total! 

'When I went to my doctor he nearly fell off the chair! But when I showed him the tests he said, "well, you definitely are".

Despite being in her fifties, Debbie said the pregnancy was 'fine' and she had no health concerns.

She said: 'I didn't put on any surplus weight, I didn't feel tired. In some ways it was better than some of other pregnancies, I just got on with it.'

Debbie went into labour in June 2011 and gave birth naturally to Kyle at Northampton General Hospital, weighing 7lb 11oz.

She said: 'I have no regrets at all, it's wonderful and everyone has been supportive, Northampton hospital and my GP gave me loads of support.' 

The ONS report on the rise of older mothers in Britain published last month said: 'Reasons for an increased number of women conceiving at ages 30 and above included increased participation in higher education; increased female participation in the labour force; the increasing importance of a career; the rising opportunity costs of childbearing; labour market uncertainty, housing factors and the instability of partnerships.'

There were 14 pregnancies for every 1,000 women over 40 in 2012, more than double the 1990 rate of 6.6 per cent. Births to mothers over 40 are now running at four times the levels of the 1980s. 

In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, Debbie admitted she does worry about Kyle's future as a result of her having him so late in life.

She said: 'Sometimes, when I watch Kyle play, my mind wanders and I worry about not living to see his 30s, but you just have to put those thoughts to the back of your mind.

'Whatever the difficulties, Kyle is a blessing.'
