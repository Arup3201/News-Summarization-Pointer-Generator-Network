Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has accepted responsibility for most of his past misdemeanours but is still 'upset' over his punishment for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.

The 27-year-old is set to make his competitive comeback from a four-month worldwide ban next week in El Clasico against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, which was imposed after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

While he accepts his current suspension, and the 10-game ban imposed for a similar incident involving Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic were his own fault, he is still unhappy over how his argument with Evra in October 2011 was dealt with.

Luis Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 and says it still upsets him

Evra celebrated in front of Suarez when Manchester United won that season's return fixture at Old Trafford

'It is good to accept that you have made a mistake and that's what I did,' he told his club's official website fcbarcelona.com in reference to the Chiellini bite.

'I left it a few days because you have to remember that I'm only human and sometimes it's hard to face the truth.

'I found it hard to take in and to realise what I had done. Those were days when I didn't want to know about it.

'I just wanted to be with my wife and children, who supported me through that time. 

'I didn't want to listen to anybody, or speak to anybody. I didn't want to accept it. When I say I'm sorry it's because I regret something. Being sorry implies regret.

Suarez refused to shake hands with Evra the next time the two players met, after refusing to apologise

The Uruguayan's snub angered Evra, but Suarez insists he did nothing wrong and was wrongly found guilty

Suarez and Evra have since shaken hands, but the Barca star insists he was 'accused without evidence'

'But they have also sometimes judged me on things that aren't true, such as the racism thing. I was accused without evidence and that's what grieved me the most.

'The others were actions when it was me who did wrong. I accepted that and begged forgiveness, but the racism thing, when I was accused without evidence, that did upset me.'

Suarez has admitted he was in the wrong when he bit Giorgio Chiellini at last summer's World Cup

The striker says it is good to admit that he has made a mistake, ahead of hm the ban next week

Suarez had previously been found guilty of biting Branislav Ivanovic, for which he was banned for 10 games

Manchester United faced Liverpool in a Premier League match. In the 57th minute Suarez fouled Evra and tempers flared at the next corner. 

They squared up to each other and Evra asked why Suarez kicked him. Suarez said he should forget about it, these things happen. Evra claims Suarez then became racially abusive, using the word 'negro'. 

Suarez denies using the word in that clash. Evra is clearly wound up, but nearby players do not seem particularly bothered. A few minutes later Marriner calls the pair together. Suarez apologises and tries to pat Evra on the head. 

It is alleged Evra said: 'Don't touch me, you South American,' to which Suarez replies: 'Porque, negro?'

Evra catches Kuyt two minutes later and is booked. He allegedly shouts at Marriner: 'You're only booking me because I'm black.'

Suarez is bemused, saying: 'I called him something his team-mates call him and even they were surprised by his reaction.' 

Suarez has been allowed to play in friendlies during his ban after successfully appealing against an original ruling which prevented him from being involved in any football-related activity.

On Monday he scored twice for Uruguay in a 3-0 win over Oman but admits he cannot wait to end his competitive exile.

'The first two months were the hardest because I didn't feel like a footballer. That was the worst part,' he added.

'It is always good to accept your mistakes but what angered me most was not feeling like a professional, not feeling like another worker, like other footballers do. That's what hurt me the most.'
