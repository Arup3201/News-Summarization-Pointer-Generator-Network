The Government is facing calls to reveal the truth about a spying operation on one of Britain’s most respected human rights activists.

Previously secret documents show the late Martin Ennals was put under years of surveillance by Special Branch. He was a key figure at Amnesty International and the National Council for Civil Liberties – now known as Liberty – and a leading campaigner against apartheid.

Details of his marriage, family and holiday destinations were recorded. His luggage was also regularly searched as he made trips to and from Britain. But the files, released by the Metropolitan Police under the Freedom of Information Act, have been heavily redacted.

Mr Ennals’ daughter Kate, who believes the family’s phone was tapped, said: ‘I just felt, “How dare they?” It’s such an invasion of privacy. It’s ironic in a sense. The right to privacy was one of Dad’s main things.’

His son Marc, who is mentioned in the files, added: ‘If they were doing this to him, they must have been doing this to millions of others who were essentially much more of a threat. He was just fighting for human rights.’

Last night, freedom of expression group Article 19, which Mr Ennals helped found in the 1980s, called on the Government to ‘come clean’.

Executive director Thomas Hughes said: ‘The surveillance of civil society groups working on human rights, environment and other social issues without justification is illegal and a violation of the basic human rights of privacy, free expression and freedom of association.’

The files cover the period when Mr Ennals worked for Unesco and after he joined the National Council for Civil Liberties. The campaigner, who died in 1991 aged 64, later became secretary-general of Amnesty, helping it win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. The files say a ‘comprehensive’ report on Mr Ennals was compiled as early as 1950 when he was a student activist. He joined Unesco, which was formed after the Second World War, in the early 1950s, and was based in Paris.

The first reports in the released files record his arrival in Newhaven from Dieppe in July 1953 and his return three days later. In December that year, he was noted arriving at London Airport from Paris. The report said: ‘Routine search of his baggage by HM Customs revealed nothing of interest to Special Branch.’

Marc Ennals said it was ‘frustrating’ that so much material from the files had been redacted.
