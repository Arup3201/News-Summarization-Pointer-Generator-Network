These stunning shots capture the natural wonder hidden deep in the Arizona desert known as The Wave and look like they could have been taken on Mars.

The 190 million-year-old formation is made of sand dunes which turned to rock through time.

They are stacked on top of another and hardened by deposit of calcium salts - causing the vertical and horizontal layers.

Hidden somewhere in the Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness Area in Arizona, USA, a special permit is needed to find the spectacular spot.

Keen snapper Justin Reznick, 36, captured the breathtaking beauty of the unique landscape on a trip this spring.

Justin, from Seattle, Washington, said: 'To see the Wave is a surreal experience - there is nothing quite like it on Earth.

'It has remnants of amazing sandstone but they way it comes together is truly unique.

'Once you obtain a permit, the The Bureau of Land Management supplies you with a map and directions.

'Basic navigational skills are needed, but it's not too difficult to find after a three mile hike.

'It's best to start at first light to photograph the Wave before any direct light reaches the walls.

"I like to stay all day to sunset, photographing in as many different lighting conditions as possible.

'There are endless possibilities for images.'
