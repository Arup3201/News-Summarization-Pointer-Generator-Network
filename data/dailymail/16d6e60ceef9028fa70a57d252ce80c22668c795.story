The second son of Dutch monarch Queen Beatrix has been seriously injured in an avalanche in Austria.

Prince Friso, 43, was buried under snow when he skied off a trail in the resort of Lech earlier today.

He has been admitted to an Innsbruck hospital where his 'life remains at risk', according to a Dutch government statement.

The prince was buried under snow for 20 minutes before he was rescued and airlifted to hospital, the Austrian news agency APA reported.

The prince was skiing with one companion away from marked ski runs when the mass of snow, 30 meters wide and 40 meters long, hit them around midday, APA said.

He was pulled unconscious from the drift about 20 minutes after the incident and resuscitated at the scene. He was then medivacked to the university clinic in the western city of Innsbruck.

His condition was 'stable but life threatening', and the queen and his wife were at his side, the Dutch government said in a statement.

A statement from the Netherlands royal family added that he is in intensive care.

It read: 'Doctors treating him describe the prince's condition as stable, but his life remains at risk.'

Stefan Jochum, a spokesman for the 
Lech ski area where the accident occurred, said the incident took place 
this afternoon as the prince and other skiers were on slopes away from
the marked Lech ski runs.

The trails were laden with snow after weeks of record 
falls.

Mr Jochum said: 'A snow slide came down and the 
prince was buried as the only member of the group.'

He could not confirm the news report that the prince had been buried for 
15 minutes before he was found and said he had no information on the 
nature of his injuries.

Members of the royal family are skiing in the mountain village of Lech, which has been hit by heavy snowfall in recent days.

Friso was in Lech along with other members of the royal family.

The second of Beatrix's three sons, Friso gave up any claim to the 
Dutch throne in order to marry Dutch commoner Mabel Wisse Smit, in 2004. The pair have two daughters, Emma and Joanna.

He most recently worked 
as financial director at Urenco, the European uranium-enrichment 
consortium.

The crucial moment in his life as a member of the Dutch nobility came with his 2003 engagement to then-commoner Wisse Smit.

After the pair announced their intention to marry in 2003, Dutch media 
revealed that Wisse Smit's previous friendships included contacts while 
she was in college with a well-known figure in the Dutch underworld, a 
drug dealer who was later slain.

The couple publicly acknowledged having been 'naive and incomplete' 
during her vetting process before joining the royal family. Then-Prime 
Minister Jan Peter Balkenende signalled he could not recommend the 
marriage to parliament for approval.

They married anyway, a decision that meant Friso's removal from the line of succession.

The couple are still part of Beatrix's family and attend important royal
functions.

Mabel has been granted the title 'Princess Mabel' and Friso 
has an array of noble titles, including 'Prince of Oranje-Nassau' - but 
not 'Prince of the Netherlands'.
