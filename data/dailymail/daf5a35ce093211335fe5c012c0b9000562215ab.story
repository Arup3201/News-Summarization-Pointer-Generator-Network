Miles away: If Prince Harry was looking to find a new woman to take his mind off Cressida Bonas he had plenty of options at his best friend's wedding

He is only just back on the market after separating from his long-term girlfriend.

But if Prince Harry was looking to find a new woman to take his mind off Cressida Bonas he had plenty of options at his best friend’s wedding.

An array of beauties were among those invited to celebrate Guy Pelly’s marriage to Lizzy Wilson, the granddaughter of the Holiday Inn hotel empire founder.

And the newly single prince made sure that he celebrated with them as he tried to put his relationship troubles behind him.

While earlier in the day he had appeared subdued – though the yawns may have been a legacy of the three-day pre-wedding party – come the evening reception, surrounded by glamorous and beautiful women, his mood quickly picked up.

The prince, who was spotted ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time.

And while his brother dominated the dancefloor, it was William who jumped on the stage singing the Isley Brothers’ Shout

Jimmy Church, whose Motown band provided the entertainment, told the Daily Mail: ‘It was a great night, it was unbelievably wild.

‘Prince William was in front of the stage moving to the music, and then all of a sudden it got to him and he got up on the stage and was singing and dancing. He was getting down and I was getting down.’

Mr Church said there were a number of women who tried to get close to Harry. He added: ‘Harry was dancing with the ladies. There were just so many, he was surrounded.

‘There were so many packed in around him you couldn’t tell if he was with one girl or 20 girls.

‘You
 think of royalty as being stuffy, but they were loose. At the end when 
we finished Harry came up to the stage and asked if we would play 
another song as he did not want the night to end. We ended up doing five
 encores.’

Mr
 Church said guests began crowd surfing as his band played: ‘I’ve been 
doing this 50 years and I ain’t ever seen anything like this. These guys
 know how to party.’

Lonely: As Harry attended Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson's wedding, Cressida Bonas cut a lonely figure in London

He
 added: ‘William came up to me and gave me a hug and said that he wants 
me to come to London. It was the highlight of my life.’

Harry’s antics at the Memphis Polo Club are unlikely to lift the mood of his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.

She was originally expected to attend the wedding, but it is thought the couple separated after arguing about the trip.

Congratulations: William congratulates the married couple - just hours before guests reportedly crowd surfed

The 
25-year-old was spotted last week pacing the streets outside the office 
in the West End where she has a job in marketing, biting her nails and 
with tears in her eyes.

It has been reported that she has now been given compassionate leave from work to consider her future.

At
 the weekend it was also claimed Harry has been sending her up to 15 
text messages a day while in the US in a bid to win her back.

Royal guest: The wedding came at the end of three days of celebrations that included a visit to Graceland, Elvis Presley's mansion. Above, Princess Eugenie (dressed in white) attends Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson's wedding

The wedding came at the end of three days of celebrations that included a visit to Graceland, Elvis Presley’s mansion.

On Thursday night after arriving in town, the guests enjoyed ribs at a barbecue restaurant before some, including Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, partied into the night on Beale Street, the city’s iconic main strip.

Before arriving in Memphis, Harry stopped off in Miami where he was seen dancing in a nightclub into the early hours.
