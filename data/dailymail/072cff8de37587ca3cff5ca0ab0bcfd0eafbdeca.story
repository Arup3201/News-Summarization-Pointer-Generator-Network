Lamborghini has unveiled its Egoista concept car as part of its 50th birthday celebrations. 

The design of the Egoista, which means 'selfish' in Italian, was inspired by an Apache helicopter and has carbon fibre and aluminium frame - traditionally seen on lightweight F1 cars. 

And just like F1 cars, the Egoista has been made for one person only, and to get out of the car drivers must remove the steering wheel, lift up the roof and climb over the bodywork.

The Lamborghini Egoista, which means 'selfish' in Italian, was designed by Walter De Silva and was inspired by an Apache helicopter. The concept car only seats one person and the driver must remove the steering wheel and climb over the carbon fibre bodywork to get into the vehicle.

The interior of the Lamborghini Egoista has minimal instruments. A removable steering wheel column sits in the centre. Above it is a heads-up display, similar to those seen by jet fighters, showing only important driving information. When the driver climbs out of the vehicle he can only rest his legs on the designated areas, so not to crush or damage the carbon fibre frame

The car's 'cockpit' is covered by a mechanically operated orange shield. The shield has anti-glare glass and is made of antiradar material. The driver's four-point seatbelt is made up of different colours

As part of Lamborghin's Grande Giro Tour, owners, collectors and fans drove various Lamborghini models from the Italian firm's 50 year history across Italy.

The parade began on Friday in Milan before heading to Bobbio, and Forte dei Marmi.

It then continured to Bologna and ended at  Sant’Agata Bolognese, the Lamborghini headquarters, on Saturday.

A total of 350 of the Italian supercars are taking part in the Tour.

Lamborghini is celebrating its anniversary throughout 2013 with events all over the world.

The company gave 10 per cent of the money made on the tour to a fund for rebuilding social centres destroyed by an earthquake in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy, last year.

The car was unveiled by Lamborghini's President and CEO Stephen Winkelmann at an event in Italy. 

It was designed by Head of Design for Volkswagen Group, Walter De Silva.

Speaking on the final day of the Grande Giro Tour - Lamborghini's tour around Italy to celebrate its 50th anniversary - De Silva said: 'This is a car made for one person only, to allow them to have fun and express their personality to the maximum. 

'It is designed purely for hyper-sophisticated people who want only the most extreme and special things in the world. 

'It represents hedonism taken to the extreme, it is a car without compromises.'

The interior of Egoista has a racing seat with four-point seatbelt, and each strap is a different colour.  

There is also a head-up display, similar to those seen by jet fighters, showing speed, fuel levels and other important information. 

The Egoista has 5.2-litre V10 engine with 592 brake horse power. 

Egoista's designer Walter De Silva designed the car to look like the profile of a 'bull preparing to charge, its horns lowered', based on Lamborghini's famous icon. It has two white front lights, two red rear lights, a red flashing light in the upper part of the 'tail', two orange 'bull's eyes' as side markers, and another two lights on the roof.

To get out of the car, the driver has to
 remove the steering wheel and rest it on the dashboard, open the dome 
with an electronic command, stand up in their seat, sit down on a 
precise point of the left-hand bodywork, then swivel their legs 180 
degrees from the inside of the cockpit to the outside of the vehicle.

The cockpit is completely removable 
and De Silva said: 'It is made completely of carbon fiber and aluminum, 
and represents a sort of survival cell, allowing the driver to isolate 
and protect themselves from external elements.

'We
 kept an eye on the future when designing the Egoista, with the idea 
that its cockpit could have been taken from a jet aircraft and 
integrated into a road vehicle, to provide a different travel option.'

As the Egoista is made from lightweight materials including aluminum and carbon-fiber, the vehicle has no-walk zones; places the driver can't stand because his weight would crush the bodywork.
These zones are marked out like they are on airliners, and are shown at the bottom of this image.

The exterior is designed to look like the profile of a 'bull preparing to charge, its horns lowered'.

This design is based on the Lamborghini brand's icon, and Lamborghini's is also known as the House of Raging Bull.

The top of the vehicle has  flaps built into the bodywork that move depending on the driving conditions. 

Two
 rear flaps activate automatically at high speeds to increase stability,
 while a series of air intakes on the back of the engine hood provides 
the cooling air flow to the powerful V10 engine. 

The V10 engine sits in the rear of the Lamborghini Egoista. Also known as the 'tail of the bull', it has been designed to be fully open with the mechanics in view. This reduces weight but also creates a more aggressive look.

While the front of the vehicle has a profile intended to increase down force, the rear is fully open with the mechanics in view, reducing weight but also with the result of creating a more aggressive look. 

The Lamborghini Egoista does not have traditional headlights, instead it has LED clearance lights which determine its position in three dimensions, as seen on spacecrafts.

Hidden behind the front air intakes 
at the base of the join between the central body and the two side 
sections, are two xenon headlamps.

Additionally, the body is made from a special antiradar material, and the glass is anti-glare with an orange gradation.

The rims are also made from antiradar material embellished with carbon-fiber plates to improve their aerodynamics.

According to Lamborghini, though, no-one will ever drive the latest concept car. 

According
 to De Silva: 'It's as if Ferruccio Lamborghini were saying: I'm going 
to put the engine in the back, I don't want a passenger. I want it for 
myself, and I want it as I imagine it to be. It is a fanatical vehicle, 
Egoista fits it well.'

Describing the Lamborghini Egoista, the design team said: 'If Lamborghinis are cars for the few, this one goes further. It is a car for itself, a gift from Lamborghini to Lamborghini, resplendent in its solitude. The Egoista is pure emotion, Never Never Land, which no one can ever possess, and which will always remain a dream, for everyone.'
