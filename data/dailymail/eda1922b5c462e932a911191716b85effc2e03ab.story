'a huge loss': Friend Harold Cook says the shooting death of Patti Wheelington (pictured) is a loss the community may never recover from

A community is reeling after jealousy led an Arkansas women to shoot dead the most popular member of the 300-person strong square dance club where both danced.

Virginia Hyatt, 65, gunned down Patti Wheelington, 59, earlier this month after years of making accusations that the well-liked widow was making moves on her husband, sources said.

A mutual friend who spoke MailOnline says Ms Hyatt was jealous of any woman who danced with her husband, and that jealousy came to a head shortly after husband James filed for divorce.

Ms Wheelington was shot dead in her home by Mrs Hyatt, authorities told KSLA. The beloved woman’s body was found Dec 3 outside her Texarkana home.

Authorities declined to go into further detail about how the two women knew each other, but did say evidence shows the slaying was planned in advance.

‘There appears to be a significant amount of premeditation and deliberation in this act they knew each other potentially socially and right know that is as much as I need to say about it,’ Miller County prosecuting attorney Carlton Jones told the station.

Mr Jones said the death was the final act in a dispute between the two, but mutual friend Harvey Cook vigorously refuted those claims to MailOnline, instead saying it was all one sided.

‘There was not any kind of dispute between the two,’ said Mr Cook, ‘Patti did everything in the world to try to solve this problem she had.’

The problem, according to Mr Cook, was that Ms Hyatt became jealous of any woman that went near husband James.

A call to Mr Jones' office seeking comment was not answered

That posed another problem, as the Guys n’ Dolls square dancing club the two women were members of paired experienced partners with novice partners of the opposite sex – leading to tension between the accused killer and most other female members.

Ms Hyatt singled out Ms Wheelington, according to Mr Cook, because she was the most popular woman in the club. Her jealousy was kicked into overdrive after husband James filed for divorce earlier this year and moved in with his sister, Mr Cook noted.

Making matters worse, the group all socialized together.

They played cards, went out to eat, went on outings together – they were very close, according to Mr Cook.

James Hyatt was very close with Ms Wheelington’s husband, who died a few years ago. Soon after his death, suspicion began to creep in. Fellow dance club members tried to convince her otherwise, but she would not have it.

The well-off Ms Wheelington was looked up to by many in the group for her extensive charity work and generosity in the community, said Mr Cook.

‘She donated to charities… she’d give you the shirt off her back, if you were hungry she’d feed you,’ he added.

Instead, she’s gone, and Ms Hyatt is currently sitting in Miller County Correctional Facility facing a capital murder charge. If convicted, she could face the death penalty.

‘Patti is away from us way too soon,’ said Mr Cook. ‘I don’t know if our club will recover from it.’
