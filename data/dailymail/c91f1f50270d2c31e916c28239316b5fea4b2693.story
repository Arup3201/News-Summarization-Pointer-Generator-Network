An actress used as the Queen's body double for a London 2012 Olympics James Bond short film was required to show the director her ankles to ensure they were as good as Her Majesty's.

Julia McKenzie, 72, has revealed the unusual audition request was made after a director was concerned her legs wouldn't match the Queen's.

Most famous for playing Miss Marple, Mrs McKenzie filmed over several days at Buckingham Palace after the Queen volunteered to participate in the film herself.

The film featured Daniel Craig as James Bond and the Queen meeting at Buckingham Palace

The short video showed Daniel Craig visiting the Queen at Buckingham Palace before boarding a helicopter - after which an actor dressed as Her Majesty parachuted into Olympic Stadium during the live ceremony.

Minutes later, the Queen entered the stadium to rapturous applause. 

Mrs McKenzie told The Telegraph: 'We filmed over a few days at Buckingham Palace and I couldn't breathe a word to anyone.

'I'd worked with the director before and she thought it was something I'd be prepared to do, but she did say she had one proviso; she'd have to see my legs - because the Queen actually has very good legs and they'd be on show getting into the helicopter.'

However, it appears the producers' preoccupation with the Queen's legs didn't end with just her body double.

The stuntman who was dressed as the Queen for his parachute out of the helicopter during the ceremony also claimed he was selected for his legs.

On the night, daredevil Gary Connery was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the Queen was wearing and given a wig before launching himself into the stadium.

Asked why he was chosen for the jump, Mr Connery replied: 'Good question. I think they liked my legs.' He added: 'I’ve got Queen-style legs.'

Gary, who completed the world’s first skydive without a parachute in May 2012, said he had only one regret from the night: ‘I really wanted to keep the dress, but I wasn’t allowed. It would have looked great on a night out.’

The result was the most talked-about sequence of Danny Boyle’s stunning Olympics opening ceremony.
