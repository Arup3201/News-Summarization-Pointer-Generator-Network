Arsenal are poised to complete a £16million deal to sign Danny Welbeck from Manchester United.

The England international has agreed personal terms with the Gunners and will sign a five-year deal after Arsenal reached an agreement with their Premier League rivals.

He is undergoing a medical with the north London club and is set to be announced  in the imminent future.

The Gunners earlier missed out on Monaco's Radamel Falcao, who has agreed a season-long loan move to United.

With Olivier Giroud injured, Yaya Sanogo is Arsenal's only out-and-out striker, and boss Arsene Wenger has been forced into moving back into the transfer market at the 11th hour.

Wenger was seen clutching his phone in the tunnel before he was due to referee the 'Match for Peace at Rome's Stadio Olimpico on Monday evening. 

Out of favour: United manager Louis van Gaal allowed Welbeck to leave the club after signing Radamel Falaco

Return: Welbeck has scored 20 league goals for United in 90 appearances since 2008

Tottenham looked to be in pole position to land Welbeck earlier on Monday, but the forward's preference was to join the Emirates Stadium club.

The 23-year-old is currently training with England at Arsenal's London Colney base but that won't stop him leaving the team hotel later to secure a loan deal.  

Manager Roy Hodgson has said he will allow players to talk to clubs if it is about a move.

With United boss Louis van Gaal bringing in Falcao, the Old Trafford club are looking to offload some deadwood within the squad.

Welbeck, who has 26 caps for England at the age of 23, has eight international goals. He has scored 20 league goals in 90 appearances for United since 2008. 

Fresh start: Welbeck has enjoyed previous loan spells with Preston North End and Sunderland

Goals: Falcao has been prolific throughout his career, earning several big money moves
