Samantha Cameron donned a Christmas sweater to help raise money for charity yesterday – and it didn’t need a detective to spot her inspiration.

The Prime Minister’s wife bore a strong resemblance to The Killing’s Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, whose chunky knitwear has made her a style icon.

David Cameron is a fan of the Danish drama, which ends its third season tonight on BBC4.

His wife bought her sweater from Save The Children and wore it to greet young fundraisers to promote Christmas Jumper Day.

Raising
money: Children from St Nicholas school raised more than £500 for Save 
The Children after paying £5 each to wear a Christmas jumper to school 
today

Samantha Cameron braved the cold and greeted young fundraisers outside 10 Downing Street this morning.

Prime
Minister David Cameron's wife congratulated the schoolchildren for 
raising more than £500 by taking part in Save the Children's Christmas 
Jumper Day, where people wear a festive sweater and donate £1.

Mrs Cameron, ambassador to the 
charity, told the children from St Nicholas preparatory school in 
Kensington that they looked amazing in their homemade Christmas jumpers 
and said she was impressed.

Speaking
about the day itself, she said: 'It is a fun and simple way to make a 
real difference to the lives of vulnerable children across the world.

'It is heart-breaking that eight 
million children under five die each year and I'm proud to support Save 
the Children's vital work.'

Good deed: The Prime Minister's wife congratulated the schoolchildren for raising more than £500 by taking part in Save the Children's Christmas Jumper Day, where people wear a festive sweater and donate £1

Mrs Cameron's woolly red jumper was bought from the charity's shop and the money donated will help feed children in the world's poorest countries.

This is the first time the charity has used Christmas jumpers to raise money, and 650,000 people across the UK are expected to take part today.

Justin Forsyth, Chief Executive of 
Save the Children, said: 'We wanted to do something fun that could get 
everyone up and down the country involved so this seemed perfect.

'It also has a serious purpose which is that we want everyone to raise money by donning a jumper and donating a pound.'

The pupils from St Nicholas school decided to raise money for the charity after hearing about its work.

Armel Esper, 10, said: 'We chose the charity because if the children died early they would not have lived for a long time and we are children so we wanted to save their lives.'

Her classmate Nathan Leon, 10, spoke about meeting Mrs Cameron and said: 'I was quite nervous at first but it went surprisingly well. She was pleased that we had raised the money for the charity.'

Teacher Kate Keightley added: 'She must have been cold in her heels. She needs Christmas socks.'
