The Caño Cristales river in Colombia is regarded by many as the most beautiful  in the world.

Known as the 'liquid rainbow,' the spectacular waters are turned into a kaleidoscope of colour thanks to freshwater plants known as macarenia clavigera and endemic to the Sierra de la Macarena, a mountain range south of the capital Bogota.

During the short time between the wet and dry season, July to November, along with moss, aquatic plants and corals, the red plants cling to rocks throughout the 62-mile long river, and help create a fusion of colours just under the surface of the water.

Pits have been created along the length of the river that the macarenia clavigera plants cling to creating a beautiful sight

A fusion of five colours are created by a mix of plants clashing with the grey rocks and the crystal blue waters

Tourists flock to the witness the display in season, with the crystal clear water showing the wildlife under the surface as well as the beautiful plants.

Green, blue, black, red and yellow are all very visible during the season and locals say the best time to see the plants at their brightest is just after a storm, when the colours appear at their most vivid.

The geological formation of the river is rich with sediment, and the rocks are some 1.2 billion years old. This, combined with the different-coloured plantation helps create the prism of colour. 

But for half the year, the river is much like any other; the bed of rocks creating a shimmering grey colour, with the odd splashes of green moss along the way. 

Looking like something from a pre-historic age, the colours of the plants almost make the water appear blood red

Tourists were warned from travelling to the Caño Cristales prior to 2009 due to terrorism and threats of damaging the environment

However, the Caño Cristales is not accessible by road; instead tourists will have to fly into La Macarena, then organise a short transfer to the Serrania de la Macarena National Park, where they can then make the last part of the journey by foot or on horseback.

The Caño Cristales season runs from mid May to the start of December. It is not possible to book tours outside of these dates.

The site was only re-opened to tourists in 2009 after years of terrorist activity, as well as the perceived threat of humans damaging the natural environment. 

There are also other important waterfalls such as Angostura I in the Guayabero and Caño Cafre rivers, surrounded by rocky edges with a great amount of 'petroglifos' (rock engravings), making the national park a sight to behold. 

You almost can't believe this is a river - but the Caño Cristales stretches over 60 miles and is wonderous in colours

The clean and clear waters offer tourists the chance to discover just what causes such a fusion of colours in the Caño Cristales
