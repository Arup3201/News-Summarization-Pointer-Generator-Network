John Wayne had a two-fisted image but heirs of the late movie star have lost a legal throw-down over use of his nickname, Duke.

A federal judge in Southern California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that John Wayne Enterprises filed against Duke University in North Carolina.

The two have squabbled since 2005 over use of the name.

Duking it out: A federal judge in Southern California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that John Wayne Enterprises filed against Duke University in North Carolina

The university objected last year when Wayne's heirs tried to register the name 'Duke' to market bourbon and other alcoholic beverages.

Duke University said that could cause confusion and diminish its own trademark.

Wayne Enterprises sued, calling the idea that consumers might confuse a top ten university with a bottle of booze 'ludicrous,' notes the Hollywood Reporter.

The heir asked the judge to rule on the matter.

Protracted battle: Wayne's heirs and the university have squabbled since 2005 over use of the name

Wayne Enterprises sued after Duke's trademark complaint over their application to call a bourbon 'Duke', calling the idea that consumers might confuse a top ten university with a bottle of booze 'ludicrous'

But this week U.S. Judge David Carter in Orange County dismissed the suit.

The judge determined that, since the university's filing did not specifically affect the state of California, his court had no jurisdiction.

Now the Duke's heirs could potentially move their battle to Est Coast courts. 

However, John Wayne Enterprises had not spoken out about the dismissal as of Thursday morning.
