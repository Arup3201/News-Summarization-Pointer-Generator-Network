Police say a New York man was arrested on Monday for renting a bulldozer and demolishing his own home, which actually legally belonged to his wife. 

James Rhein, 48, of Middleton, was arrested on a felony charge of criminal mischief after knocking down the Woodland Ave property with an excavator.

Rhein said the house had been in disrepair for years and that he went to get a permit to pull it down, however the office was shut for Martin Luther King Day.

So he decided to demolish it himself - all 840-square-feet of the ranch-style, one-story home, according to NBC New York.

Arrested: James Rhein, 48, used an excavator to knock down his 840-square-foot ranch-style home at 11 Woodland, Middletown, and deposited the debris into dumpsters

Police were notified as to what was going on and arrived to find Rhein all but finished the job. 

Utility companies were not notified of the demolition, which resulted in emergency callouts for termination of electric, water and gas.

Rhein was putting the debris into dumpsters when authorities arrived.  

No one was injured as a result of the incident.

Police said additional charges may be pending.

Afterwards, Rhein admitted to NBC4 New York that his wife - whose name is on the deed of the home - did not know what he was doing.

He then admitted she was upset when he told her.  

'But now she's over it,' Rhein said. 

'We're good. I'm a good husband, what can I tell you?'

The network said Rhein did not believe he was doing anything wrong. 

He was released on $300 bail and will face Middletown court on January 30.
