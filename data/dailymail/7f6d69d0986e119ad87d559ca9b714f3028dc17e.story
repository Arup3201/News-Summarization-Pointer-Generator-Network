The man accused of killing his new bride as they honeymooned in Australia wept as a police interview tape was played out in court, in which he described his failed attempts to resuscitate his wife.

Gabe Watson, 34, is accused of drowning Tina Watson, 26, in 2003 by turning off her air supply when they were scuba diving, prosecutors say.

During the taped interview, Watson told Townville detectives that he thought other divers in the Queensland vicinity would think 'something odd was going on,' as he struggled to save his wife.

The police interview, recorded five 
days after his wife's death, was played to the jury on the third day of 
Watson's murder trial underway in Birmingham, Alabama.

Watson said during the struggle he was breathing heavily and was attempting to activate his wife's buoyancy control vest.

'In
the back of my mind I was thinking these people could see us, or at 
least think something was odd going on,' Watson told detectives.

'I pretty much lost it,' Watson told Townsville detectives.

As the court listened to his voice, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston handed Watson a box of tissues and patted him on the shoulder.

Watson and Tina Watson married in their home state of Alabama just 11 days before her death.

They were in Australia on their honeymoon and were on the first 
day of a week long diving trip off the coast of Queensland when she 
died.

Watson told 
police 'five to seven minutes' into their dive over the SS Yongala 
shipwreck they struggled against a strong current.

He said Tina Watson got into 
difficulty and at one point banged his mask and air regulator.

He said he thought he kicked his wife with his fin to get some space from her and she floated away from him.

Watson said he swam down to get her, but decided against chasing her to the seabed and instead headed for the surface.

'I remember shouting through my regulator 'Tina, Tina, Tina',' Watson told police.

The jury of eight women and six men also looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene.

It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface.

Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of what happened.

They believe Watson turned off his 
wife's air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug 
until she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and 
letting her sink.

They elicited testimony that 
Gabe Watson, now 34, was certified as an open water scuba diver, an 
advanced diver, rescue diver and specialty diver.

Earlier
yesterday, Townsville detective senior constable Kevin Gehringer, who 
conducted two taped interviews with Watson, testified from the witness 
box.

Was it murder? Gabe Watson says his wife Tina Watson died as the result of a terrible diving accident

On the day Tina 
Watson died, the detective said Watson became agitated when told police 
could not give him back his dive computer.

The dive computer, which looks like a large watch, tracks a swimmer's dive.

'At
that stage he became a little agitated about not getting it that 
night,' Det Snr Const Gehringer told the Jefferson County courtroom.

The
dive computer, which Watson wore on his wrist while diving is 
considered key by the prosecution to prove its case that Watson lied to 
investigator.

Prosecutors
contend that shortly after Watson and his wife entered the water for 
their drive, Watson signaled to his wife to return to the boat because 
his dive computer was beeping, indicating the battery was incorrectly 
installed.

He borrowed a coin from someone on the boat to remove the battery and turned it around, and the couple continued their dive.

Prosecutors believe that it was a ploy to get his wife away from other divers so he 
could drown her. 

They also argue that a dive computer wouldn't beep if 
the battery was installed incorrectly - it would stay silent.

Watson's
lawyer, Brett Bloomstom, intends to present testimony that the 
Australian police never contacted the computer's manufacturer to see if 
the dive computer beeps when the battery is in upside down.

Watson’s defence team claimed the
prosecution is based on ‘bumbling’ detectives in Australia believing 
that a problem with a dive computer on his wrist proved he killed the 
woman he loved.

That mistake early in the 
investigation made police wrongly see innocent actions and circumstances
as proof of a crime, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston told the court in 
Birmingham, Alabama.

'Tina trusted her husband,’ Mr Arrington told the court, while Watson’s new wife Kim 
Lewis, who bears a strong resemblance to Tina, sat listening. ‘She felt 
safe diving with him.’

Rather than being murdered, Tina 
struggled and knocked off her husband's air supply and diving mask, 
forcing him to resurface without her, Mr Bloomston said. She drowned on 
her own, he said.

‘This is a tragic case,’ Mr Bloomston 
said. ‘What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with 
this last number of years.’ He added that Tina’s father was the 
beneficiary on her life insurance.

That policy was worth only $33,000, 
not the $165,000 claimed by prosecutors, he said, and a travel policy 
for $45,000 was only to cover the cost of the trip. ‘There was no 
financial motive,’ Mr Bloomston said.

Mr Bloomston argued that Tina Watson 
contributed to her own death by waiving an orientation dive and placing 
too much weight in a device meant to help her stay underwater during the
dive.

She panicked once during a diving 
class in a flooded suburban rock quarry, Mr Bloomston said, suggesting 
that she may have panicked again in the fatal dive.

'This is a tragic case. What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with this last number of years'

Brett Bloomston, defending

Mr Bloomston denied prosecution claims
that Watson was a highly trained rescue diver who should have been able
to save Tina, and instead said they were both ‘very inexperienced’ 
underwater.

Watson initially was charged with 
murder in Australia, after Tina’s body was found near Townsville, 
Queensland, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and 
served 18 months in prison.

A grand jury in Alabama also indicted 
him for capital murder as he allegedly planned his new bride's death 
while still in the state. A judge granted a defence motion to have one 
murder count dropped.

Before Australian authorities would 
release Watson to the U.S., Alabama had to agree to waive the death 
penalty as a possible punishment, prosecutors said. He faces life in 
prison if convicted.

'There was no financial motive'

Brett Bloomston, defending

Australian authorities performed 
exhaustive tests to try to recreate Tina Watson's death, which occurred 
soon after the couple's wedding. A coroner’s report threw up some 
interesting ideas.

Tina was an inexperienced diver and he
had rescue certification, the report said. The Alabama trial poses 
logistical challenges, as up to a dozen witnesses will be flown in from 
Australia to testify.

The state of Alabama has also 
subpoenaed people from California to testify about what happened that 
day on a dive boat called the Spoilsport, but it's unclear how many will
take the stand.
