It is 20 years since Vanity Fair first published its New Establishment list marking the cultural shift in American life away from an industrial economy to one more centered around technology and entertainment.

Eagerly anticipated and now required reading, the list of 93 marks out those firmly in charge of shaping the current zeitgeist, 'The Powers that Be' and those who threaten to break into this exclusive club, 'The Disrupters'.

Both lists are dominated by white men, with 30 billionaires and 36 new entries, with news moguls such as Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg firmly entrenched inside the top ten.

Top dogs: Rupert Murdoch topped Vanity Fair's 'The Powers that Be' top 25 while Tesla Motors visionary, Elon Musk (right) was named number one in 'The Disrupters' list in the magazine's annual 'New Establishment' list

Indeed, Murdoch has been the only constant member of the 'Powers that Be' list since its inception, with newcomer and Silicon Valley's resident visionary, Elon Musk topping out the 'Disrupters'.

Tech-giants dominate the 'Disrupters', with Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin at number two, and Apple's Tim Cook and British design guru Jonathan Ive at number three.

Facebook's 30-year-old Mark Zuckerberg is at five with Pinterest's 32-year-old chief Ben Silbermann topping out a top ten entirely comprised of men.

The first of only five women in a list of 50 'Disrupters' is Zuckerberg's Chief Financial Officer at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg.

Number two: Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 41, stay at number two in Vanity Fair's list of Disrupters

Disrupters: Apple CEO and design guru Jonathan Ive (right) placed at number three on the list of those disrupting the current establishment

Highest women: Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg (left) comes in at 12 on the disrupters list while Yahoo's Marissa Mayer hits the list at 15

She is joined by Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer in the top twenty at 15 along with Susan Wojcicki, who replaced YouTube chief, Salar Kamangar, in February.

Comedian Kevin Hart comes in at number 24 on the disrupters list from Vanity Fair

In a top 50 full of the chiefs of the new establishment such as Spotify, Vice, Snapchat, GoPro and WhatsApp, there is room for only one African American, the comedian, Kevin Hart.

While the Vanity Fair 'Disrupters' list reflects poorly on diversity of those hoping to break into the culutral movers and shakers, it is not necessarily reflected in its more robust 'Powers that Be' roll call.

While Murdoch and Bloomberg sit at number one and four respectively, music giants Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z both come in at joint number five - boosted by $100 worth of ticket sales for their recent joint tour, but chastened by rumors surrounding the health of their marriage.

Last year, the power-couple topped the list, but ugly surveillance footage of Beyoncé's sister Solange attacking Jay Z inside a Manhattan elevator earlier this summer has taken the shine off their glossy united front.

Former number 1's: Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z appear at number five on the list of 'The Powers that Be' - but last year they were at the top of that list

Entertainment and media moguls: Michael Bloomberg drops from two to four on the list of powers that be, while embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell makes an appearance at number eight this year

Embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also makes the powerful list, coming in at number eight, although it remains to be seen whether he will be there next year as the league's handling of the Ray Rice affair is rapidly spiraling out of his control. 

The top ten also includes potential 2016 presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton, who comes in at number nine after not featuring the previous year at all.

She will surely only rise up Vanity Fair's list if, as expected, she confirms she will be running for president - a decision she has promised to make before January 1, 2015.

Late night hosts: Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert made number 15 on the list of movers and shakers on the 25 'Powers that Be'

New entry: Hilary Clinton is ranked number nine on the list of 'The Powers that Be' alongside Robert Downey JR. at six - and will surely rise during the year

The other women in the top 25 'Powers that Be' are Sandra Bullock, at 14 and BIg Bang Theory show runner, Shonda Rhimes at 18.

At joint number 15 are the future late night triumvirate of Stephen Colbert. Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel.

When Colbert was announced as the replacement for CBS's long-serving David Letterman on the Late Show, many bemoaned the lack of diversity on the nation's television sets at that prestigious time-slot.

Fresh from the $3 billion sale of his Beats music subscription and headphone company, Dr. Dre is the first and highest African American on the list at number 12, joined in the top 25 by Pharrel Williams at 22 and Tyler Perry at 20.
