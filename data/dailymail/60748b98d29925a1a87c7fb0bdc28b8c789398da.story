Sniff... sniff... bump!

This was the moment two aardvarks crashed into each other as they tried to follow their noses to each other in the glare of the day.

The nocturnal creatures are rarely spotted in the daytime but had woken up and were snuffling around in tall grasses for food.

Smells interesting... The aardvarks pick up each other's scents with their long snouts

I don't THINK it's an ant... The animals edge closer and closer to one another until...

Oof! The two bemused aardvarks crash into each other amid the grass in the South African reserve

The animals used their acute sense of 
hearing and smell to walk closer to each other, but failed at the last 
hurdle and crashed headlong.

The
two anteaters, which can see no further than the end of their noses in 
daylight, then stood up on their hind legs and greeted one another.

The
moment was captured on camera by British amateur photographer Cameron 
Pearce, at the Tswalu Kalahari reserve in South Africa.

It
is incredibly unusual to capture two aardvarks together in the same 
picture due to their secretive nature and nocturnal habits.

Mr Pearce, 27, from Newquay, Cornwall, said: 'I was with a group of tourists when we saw an aardvark.

Fancy meeting you here! Photographer Cameron Pearce wondered if the two creatures were being aggressive, but decided they were just making friends

Hidden away: It is very unusual to see aardvarks together in the wild, especially during the day, as they are nocturnal

'We followed it but it darted in and out of a thicket, so we went to leave when we saw it come out of the other side.

'Then
I realised there was another aardvark there and I was really excited. I
grabbed my camera because it's something you don't normally see.

'Aardvarks
can only see to the end of their noses and they were moving towards 
each other, so much that they almost bumped into one another.

'They
then started doing movements which must have been for greeting one 
another, although I did wonder if it was aggressive at first.

'I think they were showing friendship.

'Although
aardvarks are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa they have a 
pretty low density and are rarely seen because they are nocturnal.

'They are hard to photograph because of this and it is almost unheard of to get a picture of two.'

Anteater antics: The animals were spotted at the Tswalu Kalahari, a private game reserve in South Africa that spreads over more than 100,000 hectares

The word aardvark (Latin name orycteropus afer) comes from the Afrikaans and loosely translates as 'earth pig' or 'ground pig'.

The animals can grow to up to 140lbs in weight and 4.3ft long and have an elongated snout which they use to find food.

Aardvarks survive on a diet of ants and termites which they catch using their extremely long, sticky tongues.
