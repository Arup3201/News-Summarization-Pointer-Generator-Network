On Sunday, homicide detectives released the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office report which concluded the baby died as a result of blunt force trauma to the lower abdomen.

Detectives said Hamilton, who is not the boys' biological father, then changed his story.

Hamilton allegedly said he 'lost control' and hit the baby several times with a leather belt. He said he tried to pick the baby up, but Sincere fell and hit his head.

Hamilton was arrested and booked into the Hillsborough County Jail.

The six-year-old boy was not injured.

The investigation continues.
