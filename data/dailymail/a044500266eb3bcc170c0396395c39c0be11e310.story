Opemipo Jaji is accused of raping an 11-year-old girl in a park in Enfield

A sex offender repeatedly raped an 11-year-old schoolgirl in a park and then bragged he would show a video of the attack to her family and friends, a court heard today. 

Opemipo Jaji, 18, is alleged to have followed the 11-year-old girl as she made her way home from school last November.

The girl told police in a video interview played to the court that the attack happened after she had got off a bus.

She said she was walking along a road in Enfield, north London, when a man dragged her into Jubilee Park and repeatedly raped her.

She said: 'He kept saying ‘Stop moving or I will stab you’.

'I tried to run away but then he grabbed me when

I got to the pavement of the park entrance.

'I kept on saying ‘stop’ because it was hurting me and he kept saying ‘shut up’ to me. He was just saying it every time I spoke.

'When I was on the floor, he said he would film me and send it into my school.

'I was saying ‘Get off me, get off me, stop’.”

The youngster was recorded a week after the attack which resulted in her undergoing an operation for an injury.

In the video, the youngster, who can not be identified, told police:  ‘He said the reason he wanted to attack and have sex with me was because I didn’t have anything else like my phone - I didn’t have anything.’

She said the attacker had demanded her phone number as she left, but she lied and said she had forgotten it.

Jaji is then said to have told her: ‘If I were you I would go home and remember my phone number right now.’

The girl said her attacker was a black man with a small afro, dressed in grey and black and wearing an ‘opaque’ headdress.

Jurors at the Old Bailey have been 
told Jaji will claim he has been wrongly identified - though prosecutors
say blood found on his shoes and bag match the girl’s DNA with a 
one-in-a-billion match.

She said: ‘He stank just like he hadn’t had a bath. He smelled a bit like smoke, like garbage.

‘He had a London, Edmonton, chavvy accent.’

Her father told the Old Bailey that his daughter usually returned home at around 4.30pm, but by 5pm he had failed to turn up.

As he prepared the family meal and 
became 'frustrated 'by not knowing where she was and sent messages on 
Facebook asking if anyone had seen her.

Just before 6pm police were informed that she had not returned home and a patrol took details of the missing girl.

However at 8pm, as he and his wife 
sat in the living room, they heard a tapping on the glass of the front 
door and on the doorstep stood their daughter 'dishevelled and panicky 
'with her clothes in disarray.

As they sat her on the settee and he 
hugged his daughter 'to reassure her she was okay now,'she said she 'had
been attacked and she thought she had been raped.”

In his statement read to the Old Bailey, he said: 'As you can imagine we were all upset by this.

'I had my arm around comforting her. 
She said the man who attacked her had left a glove in her mouth. She 
said it was really hard to breathe and thought she was going to die.'

Rosina Cottage, QC, prosecuting, said Jaji had 'an interest in pre-pubescent girls'.

The previous year, Jaji had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and robbing another girl dressed in her school uniform.

Jaji was arrested for the park attack a few days later after CCTV was viewed, and his bedroom searched.

A book was found about a little girl 
being sexually assaulted, ads for child care vacancies and a picture of a
little girl in Australia marked FC - a possible reference to Facebook.

There was also an article about missing April Jones, 'the little girl who was taken', said Miss Cottage.
