A public defender who left her husband to marry a serial killer on death row has appeared by his side as he goes on trial for a 1986 killing.

Rosalie Martinez met killer Oscar Ray Bolin Jr., 50, after working with him on one of his rape and murder cases in 1995 and married him soon after.

He is now on trial in Florida for the fourth time in the murder of Natalie Blanche Holley, a 25-year-old who was stabbed eight times in 1986.

Support: Rosalie Bolin, who divorced her prominent-lawyer husband to marry serial killer Oscar Ray Bolin, appears at his latest trial in Tampa, Florida

On trial: It is Bolin's 10th trial in the murders of three women in 1986

It is the 10th time he has been on trial for attacking and killing three women in Tampa: Holley, Stephanie Collins and Terri Matthews.

The former truck driver has been convicted nine times, but he's been retried three times in the Matthews and Collins cases.

Each ruling was overturned after mistakes were discovered in the trials, but he is now serving two death sentences for Collins and Matthews.

Despite this stream of court appearances and the grisly nature of his crimes, only 13 jurors out of a pool of 70 had prior knowledge of the killer, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Shock: Public defender Rosalie Martinez, left, met Bolin in 1995 when he was already on death row in Florida and was left 'breathless' by him

High profile: Rosalie continues to work as a death penalty opponent and mitigation specialist. Here she is seen working for the Casey Anthony defense team

His trial will be held this week and should finish by Friday.

Holley's mother told the Tampa Bay Times she is not surprised few remember his horrific crimes.

'It was a long time ago,' Holley, who is unable to attend the trial due to ailing health, said. 'And this is Florida.'

Bolin's first conviction for Holley's 
murder was in 1991 and he was given the death penalty.

Close: The couple were married over the phone, Rosalie has claimed

Convenience: She said the marriage was to raise awareness of the
 injustice of his plight - and said she might not do the same if she had
 another chance

It was overturned but he was convicted again in 1999 and given the death penalty. Again, this was overturned.

In 2005, a jury found him guilty of second-degree 
murder and was given a life sentence.

Yet the judge's jury instructions were criticised, putting Bolin back in court probably until the end of the week.

At
 every appearance his wife, who works as a death penalty opponent and 
respected mitigation specialist and worked on the Casey Anthony defense 
team, has stood by his side, desperate to prove his innocence.

Victim: It is the fourth time he has been on trial for the death of Natalie Blanche Holley, who was fatally stabbed eight times in 1986

Killed: Bolin is on death row on two separate
 death sentences for the murders of Stephanie Collins, left, and Terri Matthews, right

Rosalie, who now claims she married 
Bolin to bring attention to the injustice of his death penalty, said: 
'It's not his fault he's here a fourth time.'

Kim Seace, a defense attorney in Tampa, told Fox News that the vast number trials for the three murders is unusual.

She
 added: 'You have to remember when it's a death penalty case, it's held 
to a very high level of scrutiny at the appellate level.

'So they are going to scrutinise absolutely everything that took place.'

In 1995, public defender Rosalie Martinez was married to a prominent lawyer, with whom she had four young daughters. Then she met Oscar Ray Bolin, Jr.

The convicted serial killer was already on death row in Florida when she visited him in his cell to talk about his case.

'I felt his isolation, his confinement, his loneliness. It affected me because I felt the same way. And it left me breathless,' she told the L.A. Times.

She accepted that he had pleaded guilty to a gunpoint rape, but was adamant he was no killer, and was desperate to prove his innocence.

Martinez became estranged from her family and quit the public defender's office after jail officials said she had sex with Bolin in his cell.

In 1996, the pair married over the phone, whiles she was in a Gainesville, Florida apartment and he was in jail, she told the L.A. Times.

She stood by his side and helped defend him through the trials 
for the murders of Natalie Holley, Terri Matthews and Stephanie Collins.

Despite a public showing of affection at his early re-trials, she has since expressed doubts that she should have married him.

She told the Tampa Bay Times that the marriage was not out of attraction, but was a 'great personal sacrifice' to bring attention to what she believed was a terrible injustice.

Asked if she would do it again, she said: 'Let's just say I'd tweak it.'

But she maintains his innocence: 'It's not Oscar's fault he's here a fourth time,' she said at the jury selection on Monday.
