Ordeal: Rosemary Fadle appeared at two sensational trials over the past few weeks 

It has been an extraordinarily painful and harrowing week for Rosemary Fadle.

She had the satisfaction of seeing Jimmy Savile’s partner in crime Ray Teret – who raped her when she was an innocent 15-year-old – convicted for numerous offences for which he is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail.

Then, in a bizarre coincidence, days after giving evidence against Teret she flew to Paris to face the ‘nightmare’ of appearing as a witness in the high-profile trial of businessman Ian Griffin for the murder of his wealthy Polish girlfriend Kinga Legg. 

Bizarrely, the two sensational trials both reached a verdict on Friday with Griffin, like Teret, found guilty.

Waiving her right to anonymity and speaking about her ordeal for the first time, Rosemary, 61, said: ‘Friday was a simply incredible because both the trials finished on the same day. It was an amazing coincidence.

‘I had got back from France the day before and to be watching the news with both these trials involving myself leading the broadcasts was unreal.

‘Obviously I was delighted that Teret was convicted and that included his offences against me.

‘I just wish my evidence had made a difference to Ian Griffin.’

The verdict in Paris disappointed her as she was there as a witness for the defence, and gave a damning character reference against Kinga Legg, who had once been part of her social set in the North West nightclub scene. 

Rosemary added: ‘It has been the most stressful time of my life and I have found it very difficult to sleep with the knowledge of what I had to do.

‘Now I feel exhausted but very proud for having helped to put Ray Teret behind bars.

‘I just hope that now other women will feel confident enough to come forward and report the abuse they suffered at his hands.’

Rosemary said it is the Teret trial that will haunt her. She revealed she was left particularly distraught because she had to face up to the memory of introducing a 12-year-old friend to Teret, who was then raped by him while she was in the same room.

‘It is something I will never be able to forget,’ she said. ‘I saw that particular victim in the lead up to his trial and I apologised for what had happened all those years ago. She just said that it had stolen her childhood from her and that she had tried to forget it.

‘She didn’t want to dig up the past and there must be hundreds of young girls in the same position.

‘Ray was a very cunning paedophile. He would do what he wanted to do and just act like nothing had happened. He even befriended my parents and would drop me off in his Bentley when it was time for me to go home.

‘We were so naive. I wouldn’t have known how to tell my parents. Because I did not have the experience of screaming and pushing him off me, I did not realise I had been raped.’

Such was Rosemary’s level of naivety that when Teret latched on to her mention of a 12-year-old friend she thought nothing of introducing them.

‘I had mentioned her to him and he had encouraged me to bring her round,’ she said.

‘We were all lying down on his bed with Ray in the middle. Then he said to my friend, “This is not going to hurt”, and got on top of her.

‘I just lay there frozen to the spot while they had sex. When he finished he just started chatting away about his DJ-ing. It was as though nothing had happened.’

Rosemary was a pupil at Norris Road School in Sale, Manchester, in the summer of 1968 when she first encountered Teret, then 27, who had made his name as a DJ on the pirate station Radio Caroline.

She said: ‘He lived with three other young DJs on the ground floor of a three-storey townhouse in Sale. My older sister happened to be renting the top floor and I would often go round to see her after school.

If my sister wasn’t in, Ray would invite me into his flat to wait for her. He had the largest room in the house – on the ground floor with a big bay window. There were pictures of him with the Beatles on the wall and in the middle of the room was a kingsize bed.

‘I suppose I was flattered by the attention and it wasn’t until the third occasion that anything happened.

‘He told me to lie down on the bed and said he was not going to hurt me. He came and lay on top of me. Before I really knew what was happening he was having sex with me.

‘There was no tenderness. It was just clinical. Over the seven years he abused me, he never kissed me. He would just have sex, pass me a tissue and then start talking like nothing had happened.

‘Had I ended up running out of his house I might have thought of myself as a victim but he was very clever. He would always keep me there for an extra hour. He told me how lucky I was that I had lost my virginity to him rather than to another man who might have hurt me.’

Last week Teret, 73, who used to be known by the nickname ‘Ugli’, was convicted of 18 offences against 11 separate victims aged 13 to 15.

The offences were committed between 1962 to 1978 and the court heard that while some victims had been able to get on with their lives, others were ‘very significantly damaged’.

A few years after the abuse had begun, Rosemary began dating Teret’s housemate and fellow DJ Mel Scholes. Ray wasn’t bothered about me seeing Mel because he had so many schoolgirls visiting him at that time,’ she said. ‘But if Mel and I fell out or he was in the house with me alone then he would force himself on to me again.’

At the time, Teret provided DJs for some of the North West’s most popular night spots. He was also very close to Savile, acting as his chauffeur on occasions.

Rosemary said: ‘I met Savile once. Ray and Mel had moved to a big detached house that we called Teret Towers. I was lying on the floor reading a book when Savile came in.

‘He saw me and began to flirt. I remember he put his foot on my back and said he was going to walk on me. Ray gave him a glare and Mel took me out of there.

‘The strain of what was happening at Teret Towers put paid to my relationship with Mel. I couldn’t understand why he and the other DJs could not stop Ray from seducing so many schoolgirls.’

Living in the North West meant that throughout her life she would occasionally bump into Teret in a bar, a club or at the shops.

Rosemary, who has five children from two different relationships, said: ‘We would usually say hello and nothing more.

‘On one occasion I saw him when I was shopping with my ten-year-old daughter who was a particularly pretty little girl.

‘Ray immediately started asking who she was and looking for an introduction. I rushed her away from him. It made me feel sick.’

Rosemary went on to be a successful businesswoman running bars and nightclubs in the North West, and was delighted when the death of Jimmy Savile triggered a re-examination of historical sex abuse.

To help secure Teret’s conviction she gave three video-recorded interviews to detectives but then also went to Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to give evidence.

‘I had no screen,’ she said, ‘and Ray was intimidating me throughout my evidence but I was determined that justice should be done.

‘Ray was just a few feet away from me and he spent the entire time making eye contact with me, nodding and shaking his head. It was truly terrifying.

‘I held it together really well. I stood for the whole time clinging on to a rail and the only time I cried was when I had to recall going to see a counsellor when I was 50 years old.

‘That brought it home to me just how this man had ruined my life.’

It was just days after giving evidence against Teret that Rosemary was called to be a witness in the case of Ian Griffin.

Rosemary said she had become involved after pictures of her and Kinga emerged and she was contacted by Griffin’s distraught mother, Janet. 

‘She asked me what I knew of Kinga and how I could help,’ said Rosemary. ‘Well, I knew Kinga from 2002 when she was dating a friend of mine called Harry Gaynon. 

Kinga admitted to me that she had a problem with drink which made her violent. On one occasion I saw her slap Harry across the face at a party and on another occasion she left him badly scarred.

‘No one deserves what she went through but I thought it was important that the French court knew what she could be like.’ Griffin was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Rosemary said: ‘I was very surprised that he received such a long sentence.’

She described the Paris trial as ‘a complete nightmare’. ‘I was shown to a waiting room which was full of Kinga’s friends and family and I felt awful knowing that my testimony was going to upset them all.

‘It was very uncomfortable but having been contacted by Ian’s mother I felt duty-bound to say what I knew about Kinga’s behaviour in relationships and her problem controlling her temper when drunk.’
