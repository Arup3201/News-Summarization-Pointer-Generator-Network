She resolutely stood by her fiance even when he was convicted of the murder of his former girlfriend.

But it seems that Rachelle Louise, the partner of killer Simon Gittany, has not had her fill of court appearances just yet.

The 29-year-old model was seen attending the Lin family murder trial at Sydney's Supreme Court on Monday for the second time in a week, this time dropping the 'disguise' she wore on her first attendance.

Spotted: Rachelle Louise, girlfriend of convicted killer Simon Gittany, leaves the Lin family murder trial on Monday at the Supreme Court in Sydney

She was first spotted wearing sunglasses and a purple hoodie arriving at the court last Thursday when Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie went on trial for murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, in their Sydney home in July 2009.

Xie, 50, is also alleged to have killed Lily's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin. His defence counsel, Graham Turnbull SC, said Xie 'was physically incapable' of carrying out the murders.

The court heard that the victims were killed by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation as the murderer moved through the four bedrooms of their home in North Epping.

Mr and Mrs Lin's teenage daughter was the only member of the family to survive. She had been overseas on a school trip when the murders took place.

Miss Louise's connection to the Lins is unclear but the case is one of the most notorious crimes in recent years.

She was last in court earlier this year to support Gittany, during his high profile murder trial for throwing his former former fiancee Lisa Harnum to her death from the balcony of the Sydney apartment they shared.

Her unwavering believe that he was innocent, coupled with her striking similarity to Miss Harnum, made her a central figure in the trial.

She took to the stand to declare her love for 'romantic' and 'caring' Gittany, declaring the killer is 'the best boyfriend I have ever had'.

When he was found guilty in the New South Wales Supreme Court, she screamed at the judge, burst into tears and had to be taken from the court.

Outside, standing amid a crowd of press photographers and television cameras, Louise smoked a cigarette and continued weeping.

Louise was also spotted visiting her lover at Sydney's Parklea Maximum Security jail less than a week after Simon Gittany was sentenced to a maximum of 26 years behind bars.

Bludgeoned to death with a hammer: Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were killed in their Epping home.

The night before on national television Louise had declared that she would only wait five years for him.

During Ms Louise's second paid interview for a reported $150,000, which aired on Channel Seven, she bizarrely re-enacted for the cameras how she believed it would not have been possible for Gittany to throw Ms Harnum over the railing.

She also dismissed an eyewitness account as 'rubbish' of Ms Harnum's fall from the balcony of the luxury apartment she shared with Gittany.

Graham Turnbull SC will continue opening his defence case for Robert Xie at the Lin murder trial today.
