Holocaust survivor Henry Wermuth escaped from a labour camp in German-occupied Poland and tried to kill Hitler by derailing his train in 1942

One morning in 1942, a train carrying Hitler rattled past Klaj, a Polish village just east of Cracow.

Had things gone according to plan, the Fuhrer would soon be dead, as the three-wagon locomotive was meant to crash - derailed by a pile of logs and stones on the tracks.

Near the scene, a young Jewish man looked on, devastated that his audacious scheme to kill the Nazi dictator had failed.

That man was Henry Wermuth, a 19-year-old inmate at a labour camp in the area who hatched the plan after befriending a disgruntled German soldier, and then smuggling himself out.

Here, his daughter Ilana Metzger recounts the amazing exploits of her father, now a 91-year-old novelist living in north-west London.

In total, he survived eight camps during the Holocaust, including Auschwitz...

'My father Henry Wermuth was born in Frankfurt in 1923 and is old enough to remember the rise of the Nazi party and the way Germany changed once Hitler was in power, restricting the rights of the German Jews, taking away their jobs then their businesses and turning the German people against them.

He and his family ended up in German-occupied Poland and eventually in an ammunition camp called Klaj which was not a concentration camp.

His mother [Ida] and sister [Hanna, aged 13] were taken away while they stayed back in the ghetto.

My father still does not know how they died but he was told that they were taken on one of the cattle trains.

The security at Klaj was not as strict as the later camps as it was not under SS control.

My father befriended a disgruntled German soldier (who he met again very briefly in Frankfurt after the war) who confided that Hitler was due to pass through the area the following day on a train.

[The Fuhrer had decided to visit the Russian Front to boost morale after the Germans suffered heavy losses at Stalingrad.]

That night, my father could not sleep and decided to break out of the camp and went into the woods where he built a contraption [a great pile of logs and stones] to derail Hitler’s train.

The following day, he went as close as he could to the station where he clearly saw Hitler [whom he recognised by his hair and moustache] in a three-wagon train.

As the train started to roll, my father’s heart beat at double pace as he waited for the train to travel the 2km to where he had built his contraption.

He waited a long time but there was no crash. To this day, he does not know what happened - perhaps a patrol or a farmer had spotted what he had done and removed it from the tracks.

Henry returned to the camp. Permanent escape had probably not crossed his mind, as inmates had no idea of the horrors that awaited them in other, far more brutal camps.

He told his father what he had done and received a telling-off as it could have got them both killed.

They prepared to run in case the German soldiers came looking for him but nobody came. If he had succeeded, it might have changed the course of history.

From Klaj they were moved to nearby Plaszow, made famous by Schindler’s List, though my father never heard about Schindler until the book was published.

The camp commandant, Amon Goeth, had a telescopic lens on his rifle and delighted in shooting prisoners if he saw them dawdling or not pulling their weight.

Transferred to Plaszow made famous by Schindler's List, Henry was shot by camp commandant, Amon Goeth (above)

My father once stopped to tell two new inmates to stop chatting and get on with their work or they might get shot - but as he started to tell them, Goeth shot the one on the right between the eyes and then my father and then the one on his left.

The shot aimed at my father missed him by a couple of millimetres and tore the collar on his jacket.

He was saved because he tried to catch the first man who was shot and put his blood-covered hand up to his neck, which made it look like the shot had hit its target.

What ensued was a frenzied father seeing his son go down and assuming he was shot. [He even began to recite the Mourner's Kaddish, a prayer said by the bereaved after the death of a loved one.]

From Plaszow, they ended up in Auschwitz where they were tattooed – my father’s number, which is still on his arm, was B3407.

His father’s was B3406. From Auschwitz, they were transported to Birkenau and then several camps on including Osterode, Nordhausen and finally Mauthausen which was the last camp to be liberated on May 5, 1945.

My father had gone through the camps with his father, but eight days before liberation his father died from a head injury.

The Americans liberated Mauthausen and by that time my father was well and truly one of the skeletons you see in the horrific pictures of the camps.

He weighed just 33kg.

He was literally days away from death. My father didn’t know it but he had contacted tuberculosis but was lucky that the American soldiers didn’t kill him with kindness.

They fed the inmates with too much food – these people hadn’t eaten proper food for years and their bodies couldn’t take it and so many of the few survivors died.

My father is now 91 years old. His autobiography is entitled Breathe Deeply My Son – it was the advice that his father gave him as they stood outside the gas chambers in Auschwitz expecting to be gassed.

Very sensible advice under the circumstances, though strangely the Germans decided to shower them – because they were strong men and good for slave labour.

I take my father to speak at schools around the country. He hopes that by telling his story he can in some small way stop history from repeating itself, though they way that Europe is going at the moment, it doesn’t look like people have learned the lessons of the past.

In 1995, my father received a medal from the German government for his assassination attempt on Hitler proclaiming him a hero.

When the letter arrived from Germany, my father laughed and said: 'At the time, they would have shot me on the spot - now they say I am a hero. It is funny how times change things.'

When we visit the schools, he receives an incredible welcome and response from the children from all cultures and different backgrounds who obviously appreciate him coming.

As he is so old, there will come a time when he may want to retire and then it will be my job to tell his story and then in time it will be down to my children.'
