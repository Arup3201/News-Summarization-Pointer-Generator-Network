As an Ohio community returns to normalcy after a potentially deadly exotic animal crisis, questions are being raised about the man who released them before killing himself.

The Muskingum County Sheriff said a coroner has ruled that Terry Thompson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and then was bitten by one of the animals he freed shortly before dying.

But Sheriff Matt Lutz says chicken pieces were strategically spread near Terry Thompson's remains.

Alive: One grizzly bear and two macaques also managed to survive the Ohio ordeal

Investigators agree they were put there to attract the animals, but no one knows why.

According to the coroner, Thompson, 62, had a bite wound on his head that appeared to have come from a large cat, such as a Bengal tiger.

Sheriff Lutz said it appears the bite happened quickly after Thompson shot himself.

More revelations about the eccentric animal preserve owner have come to light today.

Thompson owed tens of thousands in unpaid taxes, and a fellow big-cat enthusiast said that he had taken in so many creatures he was 'in over his head.'

Court records show that he and his wife owed at least $68,000 in unpaid taxes to the IRS and the county, and he had two federal tax liens filed against him last year.

He had just gotten out of federal prison last month for possessing unregistered weapons.

separated from his wife

Kenny Hetrick, who has six tigers and
other animals on his property outside Toledo, said Thursday he used to 
see Thompson at exotic-animal auctions a few times a year in Ohio.

Mr
Hetrick said many of Thompson's tigers had been donated to him by 
people who bought baby animals that they no longer wanted once they 
started to grow.

'He really had more there than what he could do,' Hetrick said. 'I don't know what his deal was, but he was in over his head.'

Thompson
released 56 of his wild animals before taking his own life. Forty-eight
of them were shot and killed by law officers, including 18 endangered 
Bengal tigers.

Authorities
believe all of the escaped animals have now been accounted for, 
including the two remaining animals that were on the loose as of 
Wednesday night.

Six of the animals were captured alive and were taken to the Columbus Zoo.

The one animal that remained missing, a monkey infected with the deadly Herpes B virus, is believed to have been eaten by one of the other animals, possibly one of the big cats.

While some criticize the sheriff's department for acting heavy-handed, neighbour Sam Kopchak says deputies did the right thing by destroying the animals before someone was hurt or killed.

Schools have reopened in Zanesville and authorities have urged the community to get back to its routine.

Tragic: Sheriff's deputies shot nearly 50 wild animals - including 18 rare Bengal tigers and 17 lions - across the state's countryside on Wednesday

Meanwhile, Thompsonâ€™s wife, whom he had separated from before his suicide, is pleading for the return of the surviving animals, calling them her 'her children.'

Tom Stalf, a Columbus Zoo official who helped transport the surviving animals there, said: "This is a person that's very bonded to the animals.'

He added: 'She wanted to see them and make sure that they were doing OK, and she missed them.'

Though she wants the surviving animals to be returned to her, zoo officials said they will continue to care for the animals, and leave it up to the sheriff's department to decide if the animals will go home, to another facility, or remain at the zoo.

Marian Thompson, who shielded herself from reporters, told Mr Stalf that she is especially bonded with the surviving pair of primates.

She revealed to him that when she was still living at the farm the surviving female Macaque would sleep with her, ABC News reported.

Caged and alone, the sad survivors of the exotic animal bloodbath in Ohio are now in the care of the Columbus Zoo.

Six animals - three leopards, a grizzly bear and two monkeys - were captured and taken to the zoo after they were freed by Thompson before he killed himself.

'We are happy to report they all seem to be doing very well,' zoo spokeswoman Patti Peters said in a statement on Thursday.
