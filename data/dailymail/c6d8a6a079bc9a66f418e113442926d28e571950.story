Bojan Krkic  underwent an operation in Barcelona on Wednesday as the Stoke City forward steps up his recuperation after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury.

Former Barcelona striker Bojan, 24, went under the surgeon's knife at the Deixus hospital in Barcelona and Sportsmail understands that the operation - which lasted just under one hour and a half - went as planned.

He suffered the injury during Stoke's 4-1 victory at Rochdale in the FA Cup.

As first revealed by Sportsmail, Bojan's ambition is to be back running within three months and he is hopeful of returning to light training in May.

Initial scans suggested that Bojan could be set for up to six months on the sidelines but subsequent tests have demonstrated that although the anterior cruciate ligament suffered damage, the meniscus and the two lateral ligaments have not been adversely affected.

Providing that his recovery continues without complications, Bojan will be fully fit and ready to go on the first day of pre-season for Stoke.

He will still miss the remainder of this campaign but fears that he may also be absent for the beginning of next season have been dispelled.

The striker will now rest with his family following the operation but a decision is yet be taken as to whether he will return to Stoke to continue his period of recuperation or if he will remain in Catalonia and use Barcelona's facilities.
