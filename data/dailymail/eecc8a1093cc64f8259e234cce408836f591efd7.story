A Chinese millionare has possibly won Most Obnoxious Business Card, however that is not the only award he has been given - according to himself.

Chen Guangbiao is not only the 'Most Influential Person of China' he is also his country's 'Moral Leader' and 'Most Well-known and Beloved Chinese Role Model'.

Mr Chen, who made his fortune in recycling and renewable resources, handed out his card to journalists, including Adam Taylor of the Business Insider, earlier this week when he arrived in the US with two female burn victims, whom he had taken to New York for surgery.

He also announced his intentions to 
buy the New York Times for $1billion, something he changed to $3billion 
when he was told that the newspaper is worth $2.5billion.

The
 two women accompanying him to New York had been brought to the U.S. to 
undergo surgery for disfiguring burns they suffered when they set 
themselves on fire during a protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 
2001.

At an unusual press 
conference, Mr Chen put the two women on stage and performed a song -  
which he had written himself -about his 'Chinese dream'.

Mr Chen said he planned to spend more than $2million on medical care for the women and that he had brought them to New York because doctors here had said they could restore the women to 80 percent of their former appearance.

Hurun's Rich List of China's super-wealthy put the magnate's wealth at about $740million in 2012, but Chen said last month that he would not hesitate to sell off most of his assets if it enabled him to buy the Times.

Mr Chen said he would acquire the rest of the funds to buy the newspaper from 'a Hong Kong tycoon'.

He has said the paper, which has published investigations into the enormous wealth amassed by the relatives of Chinese leaders, should be more 'more authentic and objective' in its coverage of China.

If his offer failed, Chen said he would extend offers to CNN, the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal.

'As long as they have some influence, I'm still willing to consider buying lesser media outlets,' he said.

He also warned Americans not to trust the government of Japan, which is involved in a territorial dispute with China over several remote islands.

Mr Chen then had the two women display their horrific burns on stage, which seared off their hands and left their faces masks of scarred flesh.

Dozens of practitioners of the Falun 
Gong spiritual movement picketed the press conference saying the two 
burn victims were propaganda tools of the Chinese government.

The
 women, Hao Huijun and her daughter Chen Guo, were among a group of 
people who set themselves on fire in the square to protest the Chinese 
government's brutal crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners. One woman and
 her 12-year-old daughter died.

Months
 later, the survivors were later paraded before reporters by Chinese 
authorities to denounce Falun Gong as a cult and say they had been 
deceived into the suicide attempt.
