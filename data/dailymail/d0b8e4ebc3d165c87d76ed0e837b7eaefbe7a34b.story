New footage has emerged of the moment cops swooped in on teen star Justin Bieber as he allegedly raced his friend down a Miami street in the dead of the night.

Enlightening home surveillance video from CBS Miami sees Bieber behind the wheel of a rented yellow Lamborghini, closely followed by pal, rapper Khalil Sharieff in a red Ferrari, at about 4am on Thursday, January 23.

As Bieber, 19, drives down Pine Tree Drive - flanked by two black Escalades filled with his entourage who allegedly blocked off the street so he could race Sharieff - a Miami Beach police car is seen following him just five seconds later, leading to his arrest.

Like the 'Wild West': A neighbour referred to Bieber's 'drag race' along Pine Tree drive in Miami at 4am on January 23 as like the Wild West

The singer was said to be driving between 55mph and 60mph in an area where the speed limit is 30mph. He was arrested on suspicion of a a DUI, driving with an expired license and resisting arrest, as well as drag racing.

Bieber later admitted to smoking pot, taking prescription drugs and drinking - as a neighbour said: 'It was like the Wild Wild West along Pine Tree Drive.

Today, Miami-Dade County State Attorney's Office spokesman Ed Griffith was forced to speak out after it was reported Bieber's charges had been dropped to just one charge of resisting arrest, telling MailOnline: 'Contrary to erroneous media reports, no charges have been dropped because until arraignment (the actual filing of charges in criminal court) no charges have been filed. 

'Poorly defined readings of the Court 
Clerk’s website will lead to erroneous reports, such as this one.  
Expect no Bieber legal activity until the arraignment.'

It's believed the traffic cases will be consolidated with the criminal case at some point soon.

 comes as the L.A. County Sheriff's Department found no evidence the 
singer egged his neighbors house when deputies searched Justin's 
mansion, sources told TMZ today

The
 teenager jetted out of Miami after his arrest and has since been 
photographed in Panama soaking up the sun with model Chantel Jeffries, 
who was with him on the night of his arrest.

Over the weekend, his long-suffering manager Scooter Braun and mentor Usher flew out to 
Panama to speak to the singer about concerns they have over his recent 
behaviour. Justin's
 childhood friend Ryan Butler was also present.

Confusing: The Miami-Dade County Court website shows Justin Bieber faces just one charge - of resisting arrest. However, the state attorney says no charges have been dropped

Police
 chief Raymond Martinez said the star was "belligerent" when asked to 
get out of the car and that his movements had been "slow" and 
"deliberate" during his arrest.

And those
 closest to Justin believe the young star is out of control and as MailOnline has reported, he is smoking a 'ton' of marijuana daily as well as relying on prescription drugs.

Speaking
 to the Sun On Sunday, friends claimed he
 is spending as much as $8,285 a week on marijuana as well as a codeine cocktail called 'sizzurup'.

‘Weed plays a huge part in Justin’s life,’ a source told the paper. ‘He smokes 12 bongs a day and can spend £5,000 a week. He also takes relaxant Xanax and sleep aid Ambien.

‘For his sizzurp, Justin gets bulk shipments of the codeine syrup he likes from Canada then mixes it with Fanta Pineapple before dropping a sweet in it. He even has a child’s sippy cup of it by his bed.’

Bieber was arrested in Miami last Thursday morning for drag racing a rented Lamborghini, driving under the influence and resisting arrest.

Notoriius: Bieber's grinning mugshot has been beamed all over the world

Worryingly, the singer’s father Jeremy was reportedly driving close behind on the night, after spending much of the evening partying with his son at SET nightclub.

'His father was the one who was helping clear the street so Justin could race his Lamborghini,' a source told MailOnline.

Bieber’s grinning mugshot has since been beamed all over the world, but while the teenager, released after bail was set at $2,500, attempts to escape media scrutiny with a trip to Panama, pals say there is only one person who has the power to kerb his wayward antics – on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez.

‘She’s the only person who seems to have an effect,’ added the source. ‘But just when she thinks he has changes he does something outrageous.

‘He thinks he is invincible. He’s out of control. Hopefully he’ll see sense before it’s too late.’
