Brazil played their best football of the tournament so far in beating Colombia on Friday but I fear the  semi-final on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte against Germany will be as far as they go.

At this point, and based on all the evidence we’ve seen so far, Germany are now favourites to win this World Cup.

The Germany-France match was, to put it bluntly, largely boring. France missed that l bit of spark that the absent Franck Ribery could have provided to tee up Karim Benzema or someone else.

Step too far: Brazil may struggle to defeat Germany in their 2014 World Cup semi-final

Germany looked efficient, and I mean that in an admiring way, not a cliched reference to good organisation. Mats Hummels did very well to head the opener and he and Thomas Muller went on to give the two best performances in the team.

Germany looked completely comfortable, totally in control after taking the lead, squeezing the life out of the game the longer it went on. They exude the kind of calm that comes with experience, and that will be vital from here.

Brazil did better than in any previous match - but then that’s not saying much. Thiago Silva and David Luiz were both excellent but now Brazil will be without Silva and Neymar for the next match and that’s a big blow.

Celebrate: Brazil defeated Colombia 2-0 to put themselves into the semi-finals

They need to play better, dramatically better, and yet will have to do so minus their two best players. I can’t see it. They also got lucky against Colombia because of a referee who let them get away with murder.

How does James Rodriguez get booked for his first or second foul when Fernandinho went unpunished for five or six offences? James has been THE star of this World Cup: six goals, lots of assists, showing a desire for the ball and a will to make things happen that makes you purr as a fan.

Strong: Based on the evidence we've seen so far, Germany must be favourites to win the World Cup

Power: Mats Hummels did brilliantly to head home the winner against France

He should be treasured and treated fairly. The referees’ leniency towards Brazil has got to stop. It’s embarrassing.

I’ve written enough times about Brazil’s dodgy defence, which has attacking flair when it needs solidity.

This is where they’ll get undone. I believe Germany will win with their runners — Muller, Mezut Ozil and Mario Goetze — finding the spaces behind the full-backs and between Brazil’s defence and midfield. They’ll cause problems, big problems.

Tough: James Rodriguez was the star of the World Cup but was almost kicked out of the game by Brazil
