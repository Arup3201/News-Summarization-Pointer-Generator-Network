At just 4ft 8ins and a modest seven stone you wouldn't think Hannah Powell could pack many punches.

But in fact the teenager is a force to be reckoned with - she is Britain's smallest and lightest Olympic weightlifting contender.

The athlete - who is nine inches shorter than most women - can already lift a 
staggering 80kg but says she has a hard time convincing people she is 
telling the truth about her profession.

Pint sized: Hannah Powell with friend Josh Cartman. At just 4ft 8 inches tall and a modest seven stone, she is the running to compete at the 2012 Olympics

Nicknamed 'Power Powell' by her team 
mates she is in the running to compete at the 2012 London Olympics.

Ms Powell said: 'Whenever I meet people they are always really surprised at what I do for a living.

'Outside the gym I'm a typical girly girl and my arm muscles are relatively small.

'I think people associate weight lifting with body building and assume we all look like Jodie Marsh.

'Once I was on a night out and a man asked me what I did for a living, so I told him I was part of the British Weightlifting team.

'He didn't believe me and said I wasn't strong enough.

'So I asked him to get on my shoulders - and I lifted him up. He was around 70kg (154 lbs), which wasn't heavy for a back squat.

'It certainly broke the ice.'

The 18-year-old from Birmingham told how she got into the sport when she was 11 but decided at 14 that she wanted to take things to a professional level.

She said: 'My dad and uncle were weightlifters.

'They both retired when I was quite young but I remember going to competitions and thinking that it was something I wanted to try.

'I had my first initiation at 14 and I loved it. That's when I realised I wanted to take it up seriously.

'I think a lot of my girlfriends thought it was quite a strange thing to do, especially as I'm so tiny.' 

Athlete: Hannah has a strict routine which means she's down the gym five days a week for at least five hours a day

Hannah is a leading contender to claim one of two places available to British female weightlifters for London 2012.

She can lift 60kg (132lbs) in one weightlifting position and 80kg (176lbs) in another.

A strict routine means she's down the gym five days a week for at least five hours a day.

She said: 'The training is very technical and specific. It's also very psychologically demanding.

Powerful: Hannah got into the sport when she was 11 but decided at 14 that she wanted to take things to a professional level

'I train five times a week, plus two core session to strengthen my back and all the small muscles you don't think about when lifting.

'They do work us hard but it's worth it. I wouldn't want to do anything else.

'For me I love the competition, the adrenaline, training hard and the social side of the sport.

'To compete in my first Olympics at the age of just 19 and in my home country would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

'It really would be a dream come true.'
