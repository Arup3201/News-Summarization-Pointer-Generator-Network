Evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the Hubble telescope.

The atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets GJ 436b and GJ 1214b.

The researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds beyond the solar system.

Its parent star also raises temperatures to 232°C and these weather conditions are expected to last 'for the foreseeable future'

GJ 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the
 MEarth Project.

It is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth and its star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope to study
 light filtering through the planet's atmosphere, U.S. astronomers 
determined that the planet GJ 1214b is shrouded by high-altitude clouds.

Earlier studies of the planet were not 
able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are 
confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like Venus 
in our own Solar System.

As was the case with Venus until the era 
of space probes, the cloud cover makes it impossible to know exactly what the 
planet's surface is like.

GJ 436b is categorised as a 'warm Neptune' because it is much closer to its star than frigid Neptune is to our sun. The planet is located 36 light-years away in the constellation Leo.

GJ 1214b, meanwhile, is known as a 'super-Earth' type planet. Super-Earths have masses between that of Earth and Neptune.

Because no such planet exists in our solar system, the physical nature of super-Earths is largely unknown. GJ1214b is located just 40 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Ophiuchus.

'Both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology.

The planets can be observed passing in front of, or transiting, their parent stars. This provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres.

For the Neptune-like GJ 436b, the results were more about what the researchers didn't find. The light, or spectra, was featureless, revealing no chemical fingerprints in the planet's atmosphere.

'Either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view, or it has a cloud-free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen, which would make it very unlike Neptune,' said Professor Knutson.

'Either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view, or it has a cloud-free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology.

Instead of hydrogen, it could have 
relatively large amounts of heavier molecules which would compress the atmosphere
 and make it hard to detect any chemical signature.

'Instead of hydrogen, it could have relatively large amounts of heavier molecules such as water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, which would compress the atmosphere and make it hard for us to detect any chemical signatures.'

Observations similar to those obtained for GJ 436b had been previously obtained for GJ 1214b. The first spectra of this planet were also featureless and presented a similar puzzle: The planet's atmosphere either was predominantly water vapour or hydrogen-dominated with high-altitude clouds

GJ 1214b, whose star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus, is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth.

What its clouds are made of is still unknown, but computer simulations suggest they could be composed of potassium chloride or zinc sulphide dust.

Dr Jacob Bean, leader of the University of Chicago astronomers, said: 'I think it’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like Hubble that was never designed with this in mind, do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision, and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star.'

The observations took around 96 hours 
spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a 
single exoplanet with the space telescope.

Dr
 Bean's team analysed near-infrared light from the planet each time it 
passed in front of, or 'transited', its star, an event that occurs every
 38 hours.

Hubble's high-performance Wide Field Camera 3 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away

Follow-up observations suggested that the planet’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high-altitude clouds.

The new study ruled out a cloud-free atmosphere of water, methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.

A 'flat' signal from the Hubble data, lacking chemical fingerprints, indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath.

The U.S. space agency Nasa's 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope, due to be placed in orbit later this decade, is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres.

'Looking forward, JWST will be transformative,' said graduate student Laura Keidberg, another member of the University of Chicago team.

'The new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like GJ 1214b. But more than that, it may open the door to studies of Earth-like planets around nearby stars.'

This could be because the planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view
