Thief: Christopher Cruz headed a gang who stole £700,000 worth of cable

A gang of thieves stole nearly six miles of copper cables causing more than £700,000 worth of damage, a court heard today.

Christopher Cruz, 33, and his crew ripped the wiring from train tracks and telephone lines during a four-month crime spree across London, Hertfordshire, Essex, Leicestershire and Buckinghamshire in 2011.

Five members of the gang, consisting of six men from in Basildon, Essex, were today sentenced to 12 years in jail.

The gang carried out their night-time raids between May 1 
and August 30, 2011, stealing six miles of cable,  weighing 31,654 lbs, from Network Rail alone.

They used a van to rip underground 
cable out through manholes as well as 
cutting down live overhead cables near to railway lines across south England.

Attacking cables armed with circular 
saws, hacksaws and nail removers, the crew would wear high-visibility 
jackets in order to pose as workmen, even
placing a yellow flashing light on top of their van.

They also cut off thousands of British Telecom 
landlines by chopping away hundreds of metres of cable at a time, 
Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

‘The consequences go beyond simple theft, and pose a significant detrimental effect on the operation of the national railway network,’ said prosecutor Richard Beynon.

‘The delays and disruption divert 
human resources from work elsewhere to carry out repairs, and financial 
cost for replacing the cables is significant.

‘Also,
stealing the copper earthing cable from the stanchion supporting a high
currency system can mean the stanchion itself could become live, with 
obvious huge dangers to those nearby.’

Mr Beynon said up to 1,000 BT 
customers were affected in one hit, leading not only to inconvenience 
but potentially putting people who live in remote areas in danger as it 
rendered them unable to contact emergency services.

Jailed: Kris Kreuder, 36, left and Bill Lee, 50, were given jail terms of 16 months and two years respectively

Sentenced: Lookout Shaun Nembhard, 44, left, will serve 27 months, whilst career criminal Simon Scott, 45, picked out as a main player in the thefts, was handed his 47th conviction and jailed for three and a half years

Uncovered: Lengths of stolen cable, found in shipping container in August when members of the gang were arrested

One incident saw some 2,700ft of copper cable stolen from BT, affecting 400 customers.

Describing an attack on the rail line 
through Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, on May 25, 2011, Mr Benyon added: 
‘Network Rail received reports of a fault and small line-side fires. 
About 1,000 metres of cable had been stolen.’

Network Rail estimated cost to repair the cables themselves: £294,770

Network Rail further repair costs: £256,000

Total value of thefts to Network Rail: £550,750

BT value thefts: £162,593.30

Scrap value of the stolen copper: £57,000

Total value of the conspiracy: £713,343.38

The gang were stopped after repeatedly
targeting train lines in Bishop’s Stortford, Sawbridgeworth, and 
Spellbrook, in Hertfordshire and Boreham and Billericay, in Essex.

They also took trips further afield, staying together in a Travel Lodge in Leicestershire to carry out midnight raids.

The gang would often cut up the cable on site and sold most of the copper to a scrap metal dealer in Barking, Essex.

Passing sentence this afternoon, Judge
John Hillen called the thieving crew a co-operative, saying he did not 
see any of the men as a leader.

Judge Hillen said: ‘This was one of 
the largest series of railway thefts ever undertaken to investigate by 
the British Transport Police.’

He
said the gang were made up of ‘hitherto petty thieves’ but because of 
the disruption caused, he must pass immediate prison sentences as a 
deterrent to others.

Game plan: The gang would dig up the cables and cut them up at the scene before taking it to a scrap dealer

Destruction: A Colchester rail line with cable missing after a visit by the gang

Under cover: The gang would dress up in high visibility jackets and put a yellow light on top of their rented Ford Transit van to pass off as genuine railway workers

Mr Cruz, who has 14 previous convictions was picked out as a leading participant and jailed for three years and nine months.

Simon Scott, 45, another main player and the most prolific criminal of the group with 46 convictions for 108 offences, was jailed for three and a half years.

Bill Lee, 50, is already serving a four and a half year prison sentence for crimes dating back to 2002, but was only imprisoned upon his arrest in 2011 after nine years on the run.

He was jailed for two years today, to run consecutively to his current sentence.

Kris Kreuder, 36, a recovering heroin addict who worked as a ceiling construction worker with Cruz, was jailed for 16 months.

Shaun Nembhard, 44, the gang’s lookout, was sentenced to serve two years and three months behind bars.

The sentencing hearing for John Michael Newton, 36, will be heard on March 22.
