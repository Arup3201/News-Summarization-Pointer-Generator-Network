There is life after the Barclays Premier League after all. So insular have we become amid the fanfare that surrounds English football that it is easy to forget this.

Here at the Etihad Stadium last night, we expected an Ashley Cole sideshow. Back in England for the first time since leaving Chelsea, the best left back of his generation looked unfamiliar in Roma colours.

But it was not the 33-year-old defender who caught the eye in an ominously impressive Roma display. Indeed, his was not even the most notable performance by a former Arsenal player.

Gervinho was impressive throughout Roma's trip to Manchester City in his attacking role 

That honour went to Gervinho, who looks to have become an entirely different footballer since he left the care of Arsene Wenger in the summer of 2013. At the age of 27, the Ivorian striker should be at his peak. What is interesting, though, is that during his difficult two seasons at Arsenal he looked like a player who would probably never have one.

His contribution to Arsenal’s Premier League efforts was just nine goals.

Throughout his stay, he looked ill-equipped for the English game.

Weak, erratic and unreliable, Gervinho came to represent what appeared to be wrong with Wenger’s transfer strategy for strikers.

Here on Tuesday night, however, he showed himself to be rather better as Roma provided Manchester City with one of the sternest examinations they have had here in the Champions League — a bold statement given the tough nights Bayern Munich and Barcelona have given the Premier League champions in recent years.

Cole certainly contributed. Always a defender who could have made a career as a left-sided midfield player, he remains technically proficient and bright. Towards the end of the first half he was a toe-end away from what would have been a memorable goal as he arrived a fraction too late to meet a low cross.

Gervinho was more prominent and that was largely because Roma saw so much of the ball for the first hour.

Despite City beginning the evening with a goal, Roma terrified them at times and Gervinho’s searing pace was at the heart of the threat. Manuel Pellegrini and his team should not have been surprised. It is only two weeks since Roma scored five in Moscow, with Gervinho contributing two of them.

‘Wow,’ was City goalkeeper Joe Hart’s response when told of that scoreline following defeat in Munich on the same night. Now Cole’s great friend has experienced first-hand what the Serie A team are capable of when they have possession.

But Gervinho was better known for a string of unfortunate misses and rarely played up front for Arsenal

Hart could no nothing when former City player Maicon struck the underside of his bar early on and was similarly helpless when a rapier Roma thrust provided Francesco Totti with the equaliser not long after.

Gervinho brought a super save from the City keeper after turning on the burners to flash past Gael Clichy and Martin Demichelis just before half-time and it was the pace of the Italians — both with the ball and in the mind — that was the cause of the home team’s troubles throughout.

City can be devastating when they have the ball. In the Premier League, they break as quickly as any team. There are times, though, when Pellegrini’s midfield can look ponderous and flat-footed if they don’t have control of the game — and so it was on Tuesday night.

With Yaya Toure having one of ‘those’ nights — when he looks more omnibus than blunderbuss — City struggled to hold Roma at bay.

At times in the first hour it was reminiscent of Chelsea’s domination of City here last February and on European nights at home it has to be better than this. This is only the group stage, after all.

As the game wore on, City did find a little more of their true selves. Gervinho’s influence waned and Cole was asked to spend substantially more time in his own half.

City were the better team for the last 20 minutes.

There was enough here, though, to concern Pellegrini. Cole, Gervinho and Co await in Rome for the final group game in December and, on this evidence, City would not wish to go there needing too much.
