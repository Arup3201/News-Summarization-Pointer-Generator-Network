Scientology's star: Tom Cruise is seen at the opening of a new Church of Scientology in Madrid in 2004

They grew him a wild flower meadow in the desert where he and Nicole Kidman could frolic hand-in-hand.

They salute him and call him ‘sir’.

And when he needed a new woman in his life, they ‘auditioned’ dozens of actresses for the role.

The extraordinary lengths to which the Church of Scientology has allegedly gone to woo Tom Cruise are detailed in a controversial new book which contrasts his demi-god status in the organisation with the miserable existence of its rank-and-file devotees.

To outsiders, it has always seemed odd that the squeaky-clean Hollywood superstar has lavished praise on the ‘church’ as a force for good in the world, when a growing number of ex-members have portrayed it as a ruthless and exploitative cult that rules its brainwashed flock with a rod of iron.

Now a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning
American writer Lawrence Wright — published in the U.S. yesterday — has
painted a withering portrait of an organisation which has always seen 
celebrity endorsement as essential to its mystique.

What
better buffer against ridicule of a ‘religion’ based on sci-fi author 
and founder L. Ron Hubbard’s claims of alien invaders inhabiting our 
bodies than the approval of a few film stars, the book asks.

In
Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood And The Prison Of Belief, Wright 
claims that Scientology boss David Miscavige succeeded in cultivating 
Cruise as a spiritual leader of his movement after he became Hollywood’s
biggest star with films such as Top Gun and Mission: Impossible.

Cruise,
in turn, willingly became the church’s smiling public face, ploughing 
millions of dollars into its work and even attempting to lobby foreign 
leaders, including former PM Tony Blair, to advance its dubious cause 
around the world.

Love life: The book claims Scientology boss David Miscavige went to extreme lengths to keep Cruise and Nicole Kidman happy when the pair were married

Before 50-year-old Cruise, John Travolta was the church’s biggest star name. According to Wright, the Saturday Night Fever actor was terrified that if he broke with the church, it might use against him confessions he made about his sexuality during his Scientology spiritual counselling sessions, called ‘auditing’.

At the height of Travolta’s fame in the late Seventies, church bosses were reportedly ‘desperately concerned their most valuable member would be revealed as gay’.

Marty Rathbun — once Miscavige’s second-in-command but now a leading critic of Scientology — told Wright the church had worked hard to protect Travolta’s reputation and that there were many allegations that he claims the church helped to ‘make go away’.

Allegations: Lawrence Wright's book on the Church of Scientology

The church yesterday dismissed Wright’s book as ‘an error-filled, unsubstantiated, bigoted, anti-Scientology book’, which relied on the accounts of a ‘handful of angry, bitter individuals’ who have left the church, adding that it contained more than 200 mistakes.

Wright relates how a young Cruise was introduced to Scientology by his first wife, actress Mimi Rogers, in 1986. But Rogers’ parents were disaffected Scientologists and, the book claims, Miscavige was determined to keep his famous new recruit away from them.

With Cruise smitten by Australian actress Nicole Kidman, then 21, Rathbun said he was sent to Rogers’ home with divorce papers and simply told her: ‘ “This is the right thing to do for Tom, because he is going to do lots of good for Scientology.” That was the end of Mimi Rogers.’

Miscavige’s determination to please Cruise and Kidman, whom he married in 1990, is said to have run to ludicrous lengths.

Gold
Base is the church’s heavily fortified secret HQ in the California 
desert, where some 800 members of Sea Org — Scientology’s quasi-military
ruling order — slave away for room, board and £15 a week. It has been 
claimed that some haven’t left the base for ten years.

But
it was here, inside the razor-wire fences that Miscavige built a 
special ‘love bungalow’ where the couple stayed during their visits.

A
rose garden was planted next to it and a tennis court built. When 
Miscavige heard the couple fantasised about running through a field of 
wild flowers, staff were ordered to plant a section of desert.

The
meadow never took hold in the parched earth, and when a mudslide ruined
the bungalow, Wright claims that Miscavige was so furious he ordered 
the entire base to work 16-hour days until it was restored to pristine 
condition.

While 
everyone else lives in spartan conditions at Gold Base, Cruise would be 
lavishly entertained in the Miscavige home, which boasts two chefs and 
where even the lightbulbs are polished once a month.

Not
for Cruise and other visiting celebrities the indignity of having to 
salute Miscavige’s five beagles, as rank-and-file workers were ordered 
to do, according to Going Clear.

These
dogs, claims the book, wear blue vests and shoulder epaulettes denoting
they hold the rank of Sea Org Captain, thus out-ranking most human 
staff.

Miscavige once 
had the entire Gold Base staff line up at the gate and salute Cruise on 
his arrival, says Wright. Nobody was allowed to speak to him unless 
spoken to.

The rule 
was simple — keep the film star happy. As Wright wryly observes: 
‘Miscavige showed his understanding of how to cater to the sense of 
entitlement that comes with great stardom.’

Former
Scientologists believe Miscavige was dazzled by Cruise and his 
Hollywood lifestyle while the actor ‘fell under the spell’ of the short 
but forceful Miscavige’s commanding personality. The church leader liked
to boast Cruise used him as the model for his gutsy naval officer hero 
in A Few Good Men.

'Suspicious': Wright alleges that Miscavige feared Nicole Kidman was supplanting the church in Cruise's affections

But 
Wright alleges that Miscavige — who became Cruise’s best friend — grew 
deeply suspicious of Kidman, according to his deputy, Marty Rathbun. He 
believed that not only was the Australian actress supplanting the church
in Cruise’s affections, encouraging him to neglect it, but that she was
a ‘gold digger’ who faked an interest in Scientology to please her 
husband. If they convinced Cruise that Kidman was a ‘suppressive person’
— church code for a toxic personality — Cruise could be ‘peeled’ away 
from her, Rathbun told Wright.

When,
in 2001, Cruise and Kidman split up, Rathbun says Scientology staff 
quietly worked to turn their two young adopted children against Kidman, 
convincing them that she was a ‘sociopath’.

The church and Miscavige have vehemently denied these claims several times in the past.After
their split, Cruise became more committed to Scientology. Whenever 
Hollywood’s biggest star travelled abroad, he would lobby politicians 
and diplomats to promote Scientology, says Wright.

He is said to have repeatedly urged Bill Clinton to enlist Tony Blair’s help in getting the church charitable status in the UK.

Rathbun
said he heard one phone call in which Clinton told Cruise he would be 
better off contacting Cherie Blair as, being a lawyer, she would 
‘understand the details’.

Perhaps
the oddest — and surely most embarrassing — claim in the book is that 
of the church’s obsession with finding Cruise a mate.

In 2007, after he 
ended his three-year relationship with Penelope Cruz (regarded as too 
independent-minded by church bosses, apparently) the star complained 
that nobody had been able to find him a new girlfriend. 

A
grand hunt ensued as staff reportedly auditioned every young actress in
Scientology — about 100 in all.

None were told why they were being 
interviewed, but all were asked what they thought of Cruise.

An early candidate was Nazanin Boniadi, a strikingly beautiful and well-educated British-Iranian.

According
to Wright, when Boniadi refused church demands to give up her 
Scientologist boyfriend as part of an important ‘human rights’ project, 
she was shown evidence suggesting he had cheated on her.

After
undergoing extensive security checks, she was flown to New York where 
she and her church handlers ran into Cruise, seemingly by accident. 
Lavish dates followed in Manhattan and at a Colorado mountain resort.

Boniadi
said she later moved in with him, but the relationship ended abruptly 
when, during a dinner party, she couldn’t understand what the 
fast-talking Miscavige was saying and several times asked him to repeat 
himself. The next day, Cruise lost his temper with her for showing 
disrespect to their leader.

Wright
says that when Miss Boniadi told a friend about the affair, she was 
punished by having to dig ditches and even scrub lavatories with a 
toothbrush — a claim the church denies.

Going
Clear alleges that the search for a new Mrs Cruise then went beyond 
Scientologists — Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Scarlett Johansson were
all invited to audition for what they believed was a role in the 
Mission: Impossible films when, in fact, they were being assessed as 
future wives.

Cruise, of course, eventually married actress Katie Holmes who helpfully had admitted to having a childhood crush on him.

Wright
says several sources have confirmed Miss Boniadi’s experiences with 
Cruise, although the star insists no church executive ever set him up 
with girlfriends.

By 
the mid-2000s, Cruise was the most powerful figure in the church after 
Miscavige, say ex-members. Miscavige ‘convinced Cruise that he and Tom 
were two of only a handful of truly “big beings” on the planet,’ said 
Marty Rathbun.

He 
added that Miscavige even told the actor that L. Ron Hubbard was relying
on them to make it to ‘Target 2’ — an unspecified planet far, far away 
where they would meet up with Hubbard in the afterlife.

Scientology
is going through a PR crisis from which critics insist it will never 
recover. The church claims to have 8 million members worldwide, but a 
survey suggested there are only 25,000 in the U.S.

Last
year, Cruise had to contend with the humiliation of Holmes divorcing 
him, and reportedly insisting she doesn’t want their daughter brought up
as a Scientologist.

At
least the world’s most controversial church still has Cruise as a 
figurehead. Whether that is a blessing or a liability remains to be 
seen.
