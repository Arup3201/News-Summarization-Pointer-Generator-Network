Daddy cool: Confused.com has unveiled a £7.99 baby suit in honour ofSimon's impending fatherhood

Following the news that Simon Cowell is expecting the birth of his first child next February, price comparison site Confused.com, has created a limited edition range of unisex 'Cowell Grows' for newborns.

The £7.99 Cowell baby suits come in the X Factor star's signature high-waisted style, combining grey trousers and an open-necked white shirt.

While it's a blatant marketing stunt - the brand have their company logo emblazoned across the front - it seems that the public are showing some interest.

The company has seen 1,000 inquiries overnight on its Facebook page, where the bizarre outfit is being sold. The brand will begin shipping the all-in-one outfits in the next few weeks.

The brand claim it has created the tiny rompers 'so all his fans can join in the celebration'.

The company's statement continues: 'To coincide with the announcement that music mogul Simon Cowell is expecting the birth of his first child next February, we’re very proud to announce our one-off limited edition range of unisex Cowell Grows.

'The Cowell baby suits come with the X Factor star's trademark high-waisted belt. Orders are coming in thick and fast, so be sure to get yours while they’re hot!'

It was announced on Wednesday that Simon Cowell is expecting a baby with married New York socialite Lauren Silverman.

A close friend of X Factor 
multimillionaire confirmed the news to MailOnline and reported that 
Lauren, 36, who is married to real estate mogul Andrew Silverman, said 
just a few weeks ago that she wants to marry 
the star.

The couple, who 
have a seven-year-old son together, have been long friends with Cowell, 
enjoying several holidays together over the past four years.

But
it wasn't until Lauren and Andrew ended their relationship around
a year ago that her friendship with Cowell turned to romance.

Cowell, worth an estimated $305
million, insisted he will do everything he can to support and provide 
for his child after the news broke on Wednesday.

Cashing in: It was announced on Wednesday that Simon Cowell is expecting a baby with married New York socialite Lauren Silverman and now it seems brands are starting to cash in on the news

It has now 
emerged that Mrs Silverman’s husband, Andrew, has cited Cowell in 
divorce papers. The move, clearly designed to embarrass him, could 
potentially force him to reveal details of the alleged affair in court.

Mrs Silverman is accused in the papers of adultery with Cowell and of being ‘cruel and inhuman’ towards her husband.

In
a statement Mr Silverman said: 'My top priority is protecting my seven-year-old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my 
wife. Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during 
this process.'
