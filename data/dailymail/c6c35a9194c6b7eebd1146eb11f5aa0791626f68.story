Football fans observed a minute's silence at grounds up and down the country today as a mark of respect for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster, which took place 25 years ago today.

Ninety-six Liverpool FC fans were crushed to death on April 15 1989 when dangerous numbers of supporters were allowed to crowd into Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium before the start of a match between the side and Nottingham Forrest in that year's FA Cup semi-final.

And today players and fans held the respectful silence at 3.06pm - the same time the Hillsborough game was abandoned to deal with the tragedy. Kick-offs took place after the end of the silence - seven minutes later than usual.

In the Hillsborough stadium itself, 96 red roses were attached to chairs, painted white, in the stand. Each rose had the name of a victim attached to it.

The managers of Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn Rovers - the two clubs meeting at Hillsborough today - then placed wreathes in front of the display, to applause from both sets of fans.

This season's FA Cup semi-finals take 
place at Wembley on the anniversary weekend, and the national stadium 
has also left 96 seats opposite the players' tunnel empty and draped 
with Liverpool scarves.

Arsenal's
 clash against holders Wigan kicks off at 5.07pm on Saturday, while 
Hull's match against Sheffield United will kick off at 4.07pm a day 
later.

Ahead of the traditional Saturday starts, fans began to unfurl homemade banners 
paying tribute to the 96 victims, while clubs displayed messages of 
support on the big screens around the grounds.

In the aftermath of the 1989 disaster, police attempted to shift the blame to the Liverpool fans. Erroneous reports quickly emerged claiming that fans had disrupted rescue efforts and desecrated the bodies of the dead.

An inquest in 1991 ruled that all the deaths were accidental. A decision by the coroner that all deaths had taken place by 3.15pm on the day meant that many potential sources of evidence were not called forward, and the question of whether more fans could have been saved was left unasked.

However, after a lengthy campaign by families of the victims, an independent report was commissioned, which revealed that police had doctored statements made in the wake of the tragedy.

The revelations contained in the document led to a fresh Hillsborough inquest, which is currently being heard. On the first day of hearings, the judge conducting the inquest said it is 'seared into the memories of the very many people affected by it, most notably of course the families of the 96 people who died.'

Beginning of the day: South Yorkshire Police asked both clubs to ensure their fans arrived between 10.30am and 2pm for the game.

2pm:
 The Leppings Lane turnstiles began operating smoothly, but after 2.15pm the volume of fans increased.  

2.30pm:
 The road was closed. Fans were asked over the PA system to move forward and spread out in the space. Officers considered delayed the kick-off but did not.

Horror: Fans carrying one of those injured in the disaster using a makeshift stretcher

2.40pm:
 Large crowds had built up outside the turnstiles.

2.44pm: Fans were asked to stop pushing, though crowding was already bad and the turnstiles were struggling to cope.

2.47pm to 2.57pm: Some external gates were opened to relived pressure on the turnstiles - which caused fans to rush forward and crowd the pens even more. Pressure built up, and narrow gates in two of the pens were opened. Officers though fans were deliberately invading the pitch.

3pm: Kick-off. By this time the crush at the front of the pens was intolerable.

3.04pm:
 Liverpool player Peter Beardsley struck the crossbar of the Nottingham 
goal, causing fans to rush forward again. The huge pressure caused one of the crush barriers to break, making the situation even more dire for those pressed against it.

3.05pm:
 Ambulance staff began investigation.

3.05pm
 to 3.06pm: Police Superintendent Roger Greenwood decided the match had to be stopped and ran onto the pitch.

3.06pm
 to 3.08pm: Police called for a fleet of ambulances.

3.07pm
 to 3.10pm: South Yorkshire Police called for all available resources to come to the stadium. 

3.08pm:
 Ambulance officers, under Mr Higgins, returned to the Leppings Lane end
 to treat a fracture victim. There were more spectators on the pitch. 
Some were distressed, some were angry.

3.13pm:
 An ambulance from St John Ambulance, the volunteer force, was driven 
around the perimeter of the pitch at the north-east corner. It was mentioned that there may have been fatalities.

3.15pm:
 The secretary of Sheffield Wednesday and the chief executive of the 
Football Association, Graham Kelly, went to the police control box to 
ask for information. Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield said there were fatalities and the 
game was likely to be called off. He also said that a gate had been 
forced, that there had been an in-rush of Liverpool supporters. This 
later transpired to not be correct.

3.29pm:
 By this time fire engines and more ambulances had arrived. One ambulance was driven onto the pitch.

3.56pm:
 Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool manager, broadcast a message to all fans.
 He asked them to remain calm and in their seats. The police had asked 
him to do so.  

4.10pm: The match was formally abandoned and many fans returned home.

4.30pm:
 By this time, some 88 people had been taken by ambulance to the 
Northern General Hospital and some 71 to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital 
in Sheffield by 42 ambulances.  

5pm:
 The South Yorkshire coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, gave instructions for 
the bodies to be kept in the gymnasium until they had been photographed 
and identified. By the end of the evening 82 people had been declared dead at Hillsborough. 12 more were declared dead in hospital.

Another 
person, Lee Nicol, survived for two days on a life support machine 
before he, too, died. The 96th victim of the Hillsborough disaster was 
Tony Bland. He survived until 1993, but with severe brain damage.
