A huge explosion and fire that crippled an Indian navy submarine in its home port of Mumbai killed at least some of the 18 sailors aboard, the country's defence minister said.

AK Antony said: 'It's a loss to all of us, it's a tragedy' after the diesel-powered submarine exploded in a huge fireball rising several hundred feet into the air.

Firefighters extinguished the blaze in two hours as the vessel dipped under water, and a rescue operation is now underway in a bid to save any survivors feared trapped on board.

The submarine was refitted by a Russian company and returned to India in January, it emerged today.

Navy spokesman PVS Satish said: 'There are some people who are trapped 
on board, we are in the process of trying to rescue them.

'We will not give up until we get to them.'

He said the explosion inside the INS Sindhurakshak was probably an accident, and said that when the vessel exploded, other sailors nearby jumped into the sea in panic, some of them suffering injuries.

One man standing outside the dockyard said he heard a sound like a rocket or jet engine, then a blast, while another witness said the sky turned red.

Photos distributed by social media users showed a large fireball over the navy dock where the diesel-electric submarine was berthed, and TV reports said the vessel was nearly submerged after the fire.

The 16-year-old Russian-made sub was upgraded at a Russian shipyard last year and returned to India in January, it was revealed today.

A spokesman for the Russian Zvyozdochka ship repair company told RIA Novosti that concerns had been raised when it was inspected by experts at the Severonisk port on the Barents Sea, but he said India had not objected when they received it early this year.

A spokesman for the firm told Russian news channel RIZ Novosit: 'We signed a contract for a light overhaul and modernisation in June 2010, and completed in January 2013,' it was reported in theÂ Times of India.

'During the repairs, we fitted a new Club rocket complex and a number of foreign systems on the ship, including Indian ones.'

The refit is said to have included updates to the submarine's navigation and communication systems as well as an overhaul of its generator.

The apparent accident comes in the same week as India launched a locally refitted aircraft carrier due for completion in 2017, and announced that the reactor on India's first home-built nuclear submarine was now operational.

In August 2000 the Russian submarine exploded and sank in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 sailors aboard.

An investigation revealed the explosion was caused by a leak of hydrogen peroxide in a torpedo on board, and when the subamarine hit the sea bed there was a further explosion of torpedo warheads, so large it registered on seismographs across northern Europe.

The tragedy sparked widespread anger over Russian rescue equipment.
