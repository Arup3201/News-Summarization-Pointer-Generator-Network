Amid a bitter crisis in relations with the West over Ukraine, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has turned to China to form a new alliance.

Putin, who called Russia's biggest neighbour his 'reliable friend, is in Shanhai to agree on a widely anticipated multibillion-dollar natural gas sale.

A deal would give Moscow an economic and political boost at a time of Western sanctions, althoughÂ  China has been warned by the US to avoid taking steps that might offset the ban.

He is hoping to extend his country's dealings with Asia and diversify markets for its gas, which now goes mostly to Europe.

Russia and China have been negotiating a proposed 30-year gas supply deal for more than a decade, and officials said they hoped to complete work in time to sign a contract while Putin is in Shanghai.

But Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Tuesday it wasn't finalized.

A deal would give Moscow an economic and political boost at a time of Western sanctions, while pressure on Moscow is thought to give Beijing leverage to push for a lower price

'Significant progress has been reached
 on gas, but there are issues that need to be finalized regarding the 
price,' Peskov said, according to Russian news agencies. He said a 
contract could be signed 'at any moment.'

The
 U.S. treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, appealed to China during a visit 
last week to avoid taking steps that might offset sanctions.

However, American officials have acknowledged China's pressing need for energy.

Putin
 and Xi attended the signing of 49 cooperation deals in fields including
 energy, transport and infrastructure, but no details were given at the 
ceremony.

The price of gas 
is the sticking point in the proposed agreement between Russia's 
government-controlled Gazprom and state-owned China National Petroleum 
Corp.

A deal has looked 
increasingly likely after Washington and the European Union imposed 
asset freezes and visa bans on dozens of Russian officials and several 
companies.

The deal to pipe
 Siberian gas to China's northeast would help Russia diversify export 
routes away from Europe. It would help to ease Chinese gas shortages and
 heavy reliance on coal.

Putin told Chinese reporters ahead of his visit that China-Russia cooperation had reached an all-time high.

'China
 is our reliable friend. To expand cooperation with China is undoubtedly
 Russia's diplomatic priority,' Putin said, according to the official 
Xinhua News Agency.

Xi and Putin were scheduled to kick off a joint exercise between their two navies in the northern part of the East China Sea.

The
 two countries developed a strategic partnership after the 1991 Soviet 
collapse, including close political, economic and military ties in a 
shared aspiration to counter U.S. influence, especially in Central Asia.

A tentative agreement 
signed in March 2013 calls for Gazprom to deliver 38 billion cubic 
meters of gas per year beginning in 2018, with an option to increase 
that to 60 billion cubic meters.

Plans
 call for building a pipeline to link China's northeast to a line that 
carries gas from western Siberia to the Pacific port of Vladivostok.

A
 gas deal would mean China would be in a 'de facto alliance with 
Russia,' said Vasily Kashin, a China expert at the Center for Analysis 
of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow.

In
 exchange, Moscow might lift restrictions on Chinese investment in 
Russia and on exports of military technology, Kashin said in an email.

'In the more distant future, full military alliance cannot be excluded,' Kashin said.

'It
 will, however, take years for China to start playing in the Russian 
economy a role comparable to that of the EU,' he said. 'After that 
happens, both China and Russia will be much less vulnerable to any 
potential Western pressure and that, of course, will affect the foreign 
policy of both these countries.'
