As Frank Lampard volleyed in his first Manchester City goal against Chelsea on Sunday, the midfield veteran became the first player to score against 39 different Premier League clubs.

Unfortunately for Lampard, the last thing on his mind was celebrating such a feat as he all but apologised for scoring his side's equalising goal against his beloved Chelsea.

The 36-year-old has now overtaken former Manchester United striker Andy Cole, who held the record with goals against 38 different clubs.

Arsenal, Aston Villa, Barnsley, Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Blackpool, Bolton, Bradford, Charlton, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Everton, Fulham, Hull City, Leeds United, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough. Newcastle United, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Stoke City, Sunderland, Swansea City, Tottenham, West Brom, West Ham, Wigan, Wimbledon, Wolves

The former England midfielder has scored against 39 of the 46 teams that have played in the Premier League.

The majority of Lampard's goals came during his fruitful 13-year spell at Stamford Bridge, where he became Chelsea's all-time record scorer with 211  in all competitions.

The second-half strike was also his 172nd Premier League goal, putting Lampard just three goals away from joining Wayne Rooney and Thierry Henry as joint-third top scorers in Premier League history.

Lampard, who played 648 times for Chelsea, came on for David Silva after 78 minutes with City trailing 1-0 but seven minutes later he scored to make it 1-1, which was how the game ended.

The result brought Chelsea's perfect start to the Premier League season to a halt, saved his current club from a second successive home defeat, but left him dazed and confused.

'It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I came on and didn't do my job so I'm mixed with it,' he told Sky Sports.

'I woke up this morning and didn't know what I wanted from today so I'm glad it's out of the way. I guess this is a happy medium.'
