Two firemen who took a selfie while standing in front of a blazing shopping mall are facing the sack after 17 people died in the fire.

Ilya Bykov, 30, and Rostislav Krylov, 28, were called to the incident at the Admiral centre in Kazan, Russia, on Wednesday.

Around 55 people including two emergency workers were seriously injured in the fire, which is thought to have started in a cafe next door.

Ilya Bykov, 30, and Rostislav Krylov, 28, took a selfie while standing in front of a blazing shopping mall in Russia and are now facing the sack after 17 people died in the fire

Officials were alerted to the photograph after it was posted on social networking site VKontakte. The men may now face disciplinary steps, authorities said. 

The fire was at first tackled by a lone security guard but as it raged out of control he phoned the emergency services.

Around 500 riot police were eventually deployed to stop members of the public entering the building.

The photograph attracted lots of attention on the site with users criticising the two men.

And Svetlana Kapustina wrote: 'It makes me sick to think that while those poor people were burning to death these two were treating it as some sort of joke. 

'Shame on them.' 

Red mannequins and other debris from the shopping centre were piled up outside while firefighters looked on

Many of those injured in the fire were hurt as they tried to save their shopping, according to local media reports

It is thought that the blaze, which burnt most of the building to the ground, began in a cafe situated next to the shopping centre

A spokesman for the Regional Emergency Situations Department said: 'Most of the emergency workers called to the scene did their job competently and efficiently.

'These two are not characteristic of those who work hard every day, tirelessly saving lives.

'We are looking into the circumstances behind the photo and if it is found that the actions of these two firemen put people's lives at risk they shall be fired and criminal proceedings brought against them.'
