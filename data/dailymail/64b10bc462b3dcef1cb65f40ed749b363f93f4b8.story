Mourners today gathered to celebrate the life of teenager Jade Lomas-Anderson, who was mauled to death by a pack of dogs.

The 14-year-old was described as the 'World's Biggest One Direction Fan' on her funeral's order of service,  which also featured a photo of the boy band.

Jade died at a friend's house in Atherton, Greater Manchester, last month, and loved-ones gathered today to remember her as she was laid to rest in a pink coffin.

It is thought she may have been attacked because she was carrying a meat pie. The four dogs - believed to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers - had to destroyed by police.

Her devastated family had feared they may not be able to afford a funeral but people from their community and pupil's from Jade's school raised several thousand pounds through sponsored events and selling commemorative green ribbons.

Hundreds of schoolmates, many shedding tears, joined her heartbroken mother Shirley Lomas-Anderson, who led mourners into church for the service.

Today's funeral at St Clement Church, in Chorlton, Manchester, was a 'celebration of Jade's life', according to rector Ken Flood, who led service.

Jade's stepdad Mike Lomas-Anderson, 33, led tributes, telling mourners 'he had 'never imagined he would be standing here talking about one of his beautiful daughters is such circumstances'.

'But I can tell everyone she is shining in the sky - that place where she will always be,' he added.

'Beautiful Jade will always be in our hearts.'

Tributes: People at the funeral wore justice for Jade T-Shirts, as there is unlikely to be any prosecutions over her death

Jade was carried into the church in a pink coffin and many mourners wore 'Justice For Jade' t-shirts.

Jade's older brother Cane read out a touching poem, saying: 'Every day I miss the smile I can't replace.'

Her mother, Shirley Lomas-Anderson, had earlier posted a message on her Facebook page, which read: 'U are so perfect our beautiful princess your our hole world love and miss u millions xxxxxx.'

A private burial followed the service.

Greater Manchester Police, who are investigating Jade's death, said earlier this month it was 'unlikely' anyone would be prosecuted over Jade's death.

They are unable to take action because the dogs involved were not banned breeds and under current laws dog owners cannot be prosecuted if attacks take place on private property.

But Jade's family have launched an e-petition calling for a change to the law and her death has prompted MPs to call for urgent reform of dog control laws.

In February, the government announced it would amend legislation so dog owners could be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property.

But campaigners say the proposals do not go far enough and more preventative action is needed against dangerous dogs.
