British jihadi brides are being groomed online using a phone app run by extreme left-wing activists, the Mail can reveal.

After they are brainwashed on Twitter, Islamic State recruiters tell the young girls to communicate with them using a messaging programme called Surespot.

The app – run by privacy and drug legalisation campaigners in Colorado – is designed so messages are totally encrypted and cannot be intercepted by authorities.

When messages are deleted by the IS member, they automatically also erase from the phones used by the British teenagers so no trace of the incriminating conversation is left. 

Surespot’s owners, who have made an estimated £140,000 in revenue since it launched in 2013, insist it is protecting an ‘essential liberty’ and has no responsibility to stand in the way of IS.

The app is available for free on internet stores run by Apple and Google and known jihadists direct teenagers to download the software using public profiles on Twitter. 

Yet none of the technology giants appear to have acted to crack down on people using the app to speak to jihadists.

Surespot is run from a suburban house in Boulder, Colorado, by environmentalist Cherie Berdovich and Adam Patacchiola, a hacker who appears to be her partner.

Last night, Surespot’s owners did not respond to requests for comment, while Google and Apple declined to speak.  

It comes as three London schoolgirls are feared to have fled Britain to join ISIS, boarding a flight to Turkey before slipping into neighbouring Syria. 

Today, it emerged that police spoke to Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised 

They are the latest schoolgirls, Bethnal Green Academy in east London, to go missing are feared to have fled to Syria to become Jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'.

They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey.

Police fear their goal is to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters. 

On Sunday, a Twitter account appearing to belong to Shamima tweeted to an account associated with female ISIS member Umm Layth, formerly known as Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow in November 2013
