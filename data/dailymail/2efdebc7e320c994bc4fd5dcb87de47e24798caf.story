A San Diego father of four will stand trial on charges of murder for the accidental death of his common law wife after 'drunkenly' firing a homemade cannonball.

Richard Dale Fox, of El Cajon, Ca., set off the explosive device around 10 feet away from his trailer door, fatally injuring his longtime girlfriend when shrapnel blasted through the trailer wall on March 6, 2012.

Jeanette Orgara, 38, died from her wounds in the small mountain community of Potrero on the Mexican border, and Fox, 40, has since been waiting to hear if he'd stand trial for murder.

'She (Jeanette) stood up with her 
dying breath and gasped his (Fox's) name', El Cajon Superior Court heard
yesterday during a preliminary hearing to decide Fox's fate, UT San Diego reported.

Moments after the cannon went off, Fox phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me.'

Witness
Thomas Mowery Jr, revealed Jeanette's last words during the emotional 
hearing, where Fox was told he'd also stand trial for exploding a 
destructive device causing death and child endangerment.

Fox
faces life in prison without parole if convicted, Judge Evan Kirvin 
concluded, despite lawyers on both sides agreeing that Jeanette's death 
was accidental.

Deputy District Attorney C.J Mody 
stated that Fox knew his actions were dangers when he ignited the cannon
and state law allows a murder charge without intent to kill.

Three
other adults and the couple's four-year-old daughter, Vanessa, were 
also in the trailer at the time of the explosion, according to the 
testimony.

Fox was treated at a hospital for 
shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of 
exploding a device resulting in death.

The girl was being looked after by her uncle, Jerry, following the explosion.

One of the witnesses and longtime friend of the couple, Paul Ruehl, said: 'I knew what he was going to do.

'He was going to make a boom, light it off.'

Ruehl was in the trailer with Jeanette at the time of the explosion and tried to resuscitate her without success.

It is unclear if Fox was intoxicated during the incident, however others had been drinking in the trailer.

The explosive device was filled with black powder, taken from fireworks, components called 'salutes' and aluminum foil, Retired Detective Robert Luke testified.

The foil was so tightly stuffed into the device that the lack of air flow prevented the device releasing properly, Luke said.

Fox's defense attorney Thomas Slattery argued that his client was unaware of the consequences because he'd lit similar devices in the past without any damage.

Fox's mother, Jessica Daoodi, pleaded for her son to be punished, but not get life in prison.

She does not want her four grandchildren to grow up without their father.

San Diego defense attorney Gretchen Von Helms said the murder charge is disproportionate to Richard Fox's crime.

‘There was no intent to kill as the facts show,’ she told NBC San Diego last year.

John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego that Fox worked as a handyman and lived in the home for about six years.

'He liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad,' he told the newspaper.

He added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.'

The couple were apparently well known in the community, largely because of Fox's striking looks - he is tall, thin and tattooed.

Brother Jerry Fox, of Redding, told the newspaper that Fox 'likes to live on the edge.

'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work.'

In a jailhouse interview with NBC San Diego, Fox expressed deep regret. 'I would have much rather died than hurt her. I didn’t even know that it exploded, I just thought it went off as normal,' he said.
