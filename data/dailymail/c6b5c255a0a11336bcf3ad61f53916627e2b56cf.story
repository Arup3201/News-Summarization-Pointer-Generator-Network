As Boris Johnson’s transport supremo, he earned a knighthood – and hundreds of thousands of pounds in bonuses – for keeping London moving during the Olympics.

Yesterday, however, Sir Peter Hendy found himself in a jam as a £140-an-hour call girl claimed she had a torrid affair with the married father-of-two.

Rachael Grundy said she had a nine-month relationship with Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses last year added up to more than £650,000, while he masterminded the travel strategy for the 2012 Games.

Miss Grundy also said Sir Peter gave her free travel in the form of four £10 Oyster cards and a London 2012 badge, admitting: 'He wasn't very romantic when it came to gifts'.

She added there was no need for the 'weird' Oyster cards because 'I lived in central London and never used public transport'.

The 40-year-old claimed she and the 
Commissioner of Transport for London, a close colleague of mayor Mr 
Johnson, began having weekly sex sessions before falling in love.

She
said the 60-year-old multi-millionaire also agreed to be a financial 
guarantor so she could rent a flat.

But, said Miss Grundy, Sir Peter 
left her homeless and penniless after changing his mind when his wife 
discovered their fling.

Sir Peter, knighted by Princess Anne in March 
for services to transport and the community, was with wife Sue yesterday
at their £1.25million Georgian villa in Bath as details of his alleged 
affair emerged. ‘I have absolutely nothing to say about my personal life
whatsoever,’ he said.

Mr Johnson – who is known for his own colourful private life – also declined to comment.

But
Miss Grundy, 40, said Sir Peter, one of Britain’s highest paid 
public-sector workers, first contacted her in November 2011 through a 
sordid escorting website and booked her for a three-hour session at her 
London flat.

She described 
her first impressions as of ‘a lovely, considerate, polite man’ who was 
‘lots of fun’ and added: ‘We hit it off immediately.’

Affair claims: Sir Peter allegedly helped hooker Rachael Grundy rent a central London flat but pulled the plug at the last minute

She
said he began booking her every week and she regularly stayed the night
at his London flat while his wife was in the West Country.

‘I
stopped charging him by the hour and it developed into a proper 
relationship. I fell in love with him,’ she said. ‘He’d give me money 
but we never discussed it. It wasn’t about money.’

Miss
Grundy said she knew only that Sir Peter was ‘involved with London 
transport’ and would regularly mention the mayor. ‘He was close to 
Boris. They spent a lot of time together. I remember him saying that 
they’d go for private tours of the Olympic site together.’

She
also described her ‘heartbreak’ when the alleged affair ended after Sir
Peter went back on his agreement to be her guarantor. 

She told The 
Sun: ‘He had promised he would take care of me and protect me. I put all
my trust in him – he was my knight in shining armour. I only realised 
he was an important public official with a knighthood about two months 
ago.

‘I decided to go public
with this because I felt it was unfair that he – who is so rich and 
powerful thanks to his public sector job – got away with it and moved on
with his life.’

Last night 
friends of Sir Peter said he did not spend ‘a penny’ of public money on 
the affair. A source also claimed the strength of the relationship had 
been exaggerated.

The 
transport boss is understood to have agreed to put his name and job on a
guarantor form so Miss Grundy could rent a new flat, but is not 
believed to have signed the form after becoming ‘uncomfortable’  and 
realising it was not ‘sensible’.

Sir
Peter’s salary package last year was £333,000, plus two years’  bonuses
totalling £319,000. Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who led 
the remuneration committee, cited the ‘impressive performance’ of the 
transport network.

The mayor
also described Sir Peter as ‘richly deserving’ of his knighthood. 
Twice-married Mr Johnson lost his job on the Tory front bench after 
denying he had an affair with a journalist colleague.

Claims: Sir Peter Hendy has refused to comment on reports that he had a nine-month affair with hooker Rachael Grundy

By Ray Massey, Transport Editor

Sir Peter Hendy is a mix of deep red and true blue blood.

The multi-millionaire transport boss is the grandson of a baron and was educated at one of London’s top public schools – but his father Jack was a communist electrician, while his brother John is a QC and leading Left-wing barrister who has often represented London Underground’s nemesis, the RMT trade union led by Bob Crow.

Sir Peter’s late mother Mary was the youngest daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford and grew up at Wynford Manor, the 16th century Dorset ancestral home of successive barons since 1829.

She ‘came out’ as a debutante before turning to socialism, social work and nursing, eventually becoming a teacher in Ealing. Sir Peter attended the fee-paying Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith – where actors Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman were pupils – before reading economics at Leeds University.

He began his career in 1975 as a London Transport graduate trainee, being taught how to drive a bus and work as a conductor.

He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a £34million management buyout in 1995 – and his stake was worth £4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for £54million.

Despite being a close ally of ‘Red’ Ken Livingstone when he was London mayor, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson, to whom he now reports, saying: ‘Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken.’ He also noted: ‘I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, I’m not sure I’m more Left-leaning than he is.’

He became TfL commissioner in February 2006 and is now the capital’s longest-serving transport boss since the Second World War.

Sir Peter caused a storm when he got rid of the traditional Routemaster London bus in favour of the ‘bendy buses’, which were abolished after several spontaneously ignited. He also supported the controversial western extension of the congestion charge – also now abolished.
