It basks in the glory of being Sir Francis Drake’s local, parts of it proudly hewn from the spoils  of the Spanish Armada he helped to defeat.

But even though the Minerva Inn in Plymouth went on to survive centuries of redevelopment around it – and later escape Hitler’s bombs – the ancient hostelry may finally have encountered an enemy it cannot defeat.

Safety officials have decided the 16th century building’s timber beams and woodwork pose a fire risk, and must be covered in flame retardant paint.

The pub's owners have also been told to paint a ceiling that bears years of hand-written messages from modern day visitors, celebrities, and servicemen who signed their name before going off to war - some never to return

An enforcement order means centuries of history could, quite literally, be glossed over.

The pub’s owners have also been told to paint a ceiling that bears years of hand-written messages from modern day visitors, celebrities, and servicemen who signed their name before going off to war – some never to return.

Yesterday landlady Shelley Jones said of the paint plan: ‘I don’t think Drake would have thought very much of the idea. 

‘The place has been here for nearly 500 years and it hasn’t burned down yet.

Estimates of the pub's age vary but English Heritage lists it as late 16th century, while local historians declare it to be the oldest in Plymouth

‘But it’s a 16th century timber-framed building. If it catches fire, I’m not sure a coat of paint is going to do much good.’

Estimates of the pub’s age vary but English Heritage lists it as  late 16th century, while local historians declare it to be the oldest in Plymouth.

Parts of it are said to incorporate timbers from the galleons of the Spanish Armada of 1588.

Drake was among the commanders whose own ships harried and repelled  the Spaniards – reputedly after finishing his game of bowls on nearby Plymouth Hoe.

A central pillar that forms part of a spiral staircase is apparently a mast from one of the stricken enemy vessels.

Shelley Jones said of the paint plan: 'I don't think Drake would have thought very much of the idea. The place has been here for nearly 500 years and it hasn't burned down yet'

Drake later lived a few doors away at the top of the cobbled street in which it still stands.

Centuries afterwards, the pub somehow survived the Second World War Blitz that flattened vast areas of the city.

It also survived decades of redevelopment around it.

The tradition of signing the Minerva ceiling began in 1970, and resumed in 1999 after redecoration.

Mrs Jones, 43, who runs the Grade II-listed pub with husband Martin, 45, told the Mail: ‘The fire safety people came round and told us we needed to paint the woodwork, including the old ships’ timber and the wood-panelled ceiling.

‘We live upstairs and the paint is meant to retard the flames to give us time to escape – although to  do that, we’d have to jump from one of the upstairs windows anyway.’

Mr and Mrs Jones are now negotiating to find a way of fire-proofing the wood without damaging or masking it, possibly by using  varnish instead of paint.

Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said: ‘Safeguarding  heritage from the ravages of fire is a vital part of the protection work of the fire service.’
