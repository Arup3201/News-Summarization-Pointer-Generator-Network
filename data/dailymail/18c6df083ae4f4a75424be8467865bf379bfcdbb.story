Politicians struggling with stress are being treated by an on-site psychiatrist at the Houses of Parliament.

The taxpayer funded therapist is holding surgeries for MPs and peers as part of Parliament's occupational health service as more and more politicians admit to suffering with mental health issues.

Politicians have access to the psychiatrist across the road at Millbank as part of a contract with St Thomas' Hospital which was signed following the 2010 general election.

A Parliamentary spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Parliament is committed to the well-being of members of both Houses and staff.

'Consequently, the House offers a confidential medical screening facility which encompasses both physical and mental wellbeing.'

MPs access to a psychiatrist was welcomed by mental health charity Sane.

The news follows revelations earlier this year by several MPs who lifted the lid on their debilitating mental health problems during a Commons debate.

Former GP and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston told fellow MPs how she suffered severe’ post-natal depression ‘at the happiest time of my life’ and that she had suicidal feelings at her lowest.

After returning to work she suffered panic attacks on her commute to work, she revealed.

Tory backbencher Charles Walker also revealed that he had suffered from OCD for more than 30 years having to do everything, from turning off lights to washing his hands, four times.

He said at the time: 'Woe betide me if I switch off a light five times – then I must do it another three times.’

Candid: Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered from what he described as the 'black dog' of depression

‘Counting becomes very, very important.

‘I have been pretty healthy for five years but just when you let your guard down this aggressive friend comes and smacks you right in the face.

‘For example, I was on holiday recently and I took a beautiful photograph of my son carrying a fishing rod and I was glowing with pride.

‘But then the voice starts that if you don’t get rid of that photograph your child will die.

'You know you shouldn’t give in to them because they shouldn’t be there and it ain’t going to happen.

'But in the end you’re not going to risk your child so you give in to the voices and then you feel pretty miserable about life.’

And former defence minister Kevan Jones told MPs that he suffered from depression and that mental illness should not be seen as a weakness in politics.

It was thought at the time to be the first time that politicians had spoke so openly about mental illness.

In modern times, only Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alistair Campbell has spoken out about depression in the political sphere.

Winston Churchill is famously said to have suffered from the 'black dog' of depression.
