Plans to build the first house in Britain designed by the renowned 20th century American architect Frank Lloyd Wright have been revealed today.

Engineer Dr Hugh Pratt and his wife have been granted a licence by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to use a design originally created in the 1940s for a site in California.

The plans were never used and now new drawings have been produced, upgrading the building to fit in with 21st century regulations and building methods.

Original: A watercolour artist's impression of what the house could look like when it's built on the former Tyntesfield Estate land south of Bristol by engineer Dr Hugh Pratt

Before: The plot of land where Dr Pratt plans to create the building is in a green belt area south of Bristol

If approved by planners, the proposed property would be built on a plot of green belt land which once formed part of the Tyntesfield Estate, south of Bristol.

The development will be the last house designed by Wright to be built anywhere in the world.

Noted: The architect, pictured when he was 87, who created over a thousand buildings, died in 1959

Dr Pratt has vowed to make the building open for public viewing and has even drawn up a transport plan with visitor access by a six-seater mini-bus.

Architect Stephen Brooks, who is based in Bath, Somerset, has been working with the Foundation to reconcile the original plans with 21st century regulations.

He said: 'Outside the US and Japan there is only one other Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building.

'Dr Pratt has worked for many years in the United States as a specialist in preventing construction crane fatalities.

'This opportunity to be selected to build a Frank Lloyd Wright house can be seen as an accolade to him and this country.'

Frank Lloyd Wright, who died aged 91 in 1959, was one of the most influential architects of the last century.

He
coined the phrase 'organic architecture' to describe his philosophy 
that structures should be in harmony with humanity and the environment.

Stephen
Nemtin, a senior architect with the foundation with 50 years 
experience, drew up the new plans, which have now been submitted to 
North Somerset Council.

Plans: This shows the general layout of the house and includes various suites and a car port

Plans: These drawings show the buildings from different elevations and from alternate directions

He has visited the Tyntesfield site and confirmed its suitability for the design.

The single-storey property will be made of local stone and set in 1.25 acres of land.

It
includes three bedrooms - a master suite, a family suite and a guest 
suite - a children's room, a circular library, a swimming pool and a 
dancing area.

New plan: The plan of the Bristol site showing the grid and levels to the National Grid

Landscaping: Another plan showing the landscape conception and the building's relation to the lake

Bird's eye view: A site location plan from above that shows the area in relation to other buildings and roads

Architects in the United States who were trained by him to execute his designs no longer remain in practice.

The Pratts have made improvements to public footpath access, and the habitat, including creating a new lake.

It is hoped the house would use lake water for underground heating, with fresh water coming from natural springs.

Frank Lloyd Wright was an American architect, interior designer and writer who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 532 works.

Wright was keen on designing buildings that would be in harmony the environment, a philosophy he called 'organic architecture'.

He died in April 1959.

He is best known for buildings such as:

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York City

Abraham Lincoln Center, Chicago

Rookery Buildingm, Chicago

Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, Japan

Jiyu Gakuen Girlsâ€™ School, Tokyo, Japan

Arizona Biltmore Hotel, Phoenix

Johnson Wax Headquarters, Racine, Wisconsin

J. Edgar Wall Water Dome, Lakeland, Florida

Price Tower, Bartlesville, Oklahoma

Beth Sholom Synagogue, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania

Objector Mark Lewis added: 'The site can be seen with Tyntesfield house and other old buildings in the back drop.

'A modernist building in this context is out of character.

'Even with some modern refinements, it's a museum piece, that's probably why no new ones have been built.'

Many other residents shared concerns about the affect the new property would have on the visual beauty of the surrounding areas.

A man named only as Mr Stone said: 'The proposed development will have a detrimental effect upon the surrounding environment and is totally out of keeping with the buildings and rural landscape in the vicinity.'

Neighbour Pauline Jones, who lives adjacent to the proposed development site, added: 'The proposed dwelling would have an adverse affect on the visual amenity of the area and would be entirely out of character to the local environment.
