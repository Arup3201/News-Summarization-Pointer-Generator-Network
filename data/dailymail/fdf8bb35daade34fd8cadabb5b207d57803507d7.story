Assassinated: Burhanuddin Rabbani was killed by a suicide bomber

A former Afghan president was today assassinated by a suicide bomber who had concealed explosives in his turban.

Burhanuddin Rabbani had been heading a government peace council set up to build contacts with the Taliban.  

Four of his bodyguards also died and a key presidential adviser was wounded.

President Hamid Karzai cut short a visit to the U.S. over the attack, which dealt a harsh blow to peace efforts after a decade of war.

The turban bomber entered Rabbani's 
house in the capital Kabul on Tuesday evening and blew himself up 
inside, Mohammad Zahir, the chief of criminal investigation for the 
Kabul police.

Rabbani 
headed the country's High Peace Council, which was set up by the Afghan 
government to work toward a political solution to the decade-long war. 
However, it had made little headway since it was formed a year ago.

Rabbani
was president of the Afghan government that preceded the Taliban rule. 
After he was driven from Kabul in 1996, he became the nominal head of 
the Northern Alliance, mostly minority Tajiks and Uzbeks, who swept to 
power in Kabul after the Taliban's fall. Rabbani is an ethnic Tajik.

His
killing dampens hopes of starting peace negotiations with Taliban 
insurgents and also will hamper efforts to keep regional and ethnic 
rivalries, which feed the insurgency, in check.

As
one of the wise old man of Afghan politics and the leader of the 
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, Rabanni's role in the attempts to reach 
out to the Taliban and seeking a political deal with them - with the 
U.S. blessing - will be hard to replicate in the near future.

His
death could unleash a well of resentment building up among some senior 
Northern Alliance members, who accuse President Hamid Karzai of 
colluding with the Taliban.

Already
Afghanistan's ethnic minorities have begun to re-arm in the face of 
negotiations with the Taliban. Rabbani's death is likely to accelerate 
the re-arming and lay the foundation for a bitter civil war once U.S. 
troops leave the country in 2014.

Karzai's adviser Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai was wounded in the attack.

A relative who answered Stanekzai's phone said that the wounds did not appear to be life-threatening, but Stanekzai was in the hospital.

The relative declined to give his name because of the sensitivity of the situation

Stanekzai is chief executive of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program, a highly touted program funded by the U.S. and its coalition allies to bring mid- and lower-level Taliban back into Afghan society.

The programme has so far only managed to reintegrated about 2,000 of the estimated 25,000-40,000 insurgents in Afghanistan.

Reintegration was the other half of reconciliation, which is aims to try and broker a peace deal with the senior Taliban leadership.
