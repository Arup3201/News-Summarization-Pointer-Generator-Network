Oscar-winning actor and director Ben Affleck testified before the U.S. Senate on Thursday about the continuing importance of foreign aid to developing nations.

Affleck, founder of the nonprofit Eastern Congo Initiative, was joined by Bill Gates, as the pair addressed members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. 

The committee was meeting to discuss the $50 billion budget spent on non-lethal aid to Africa. It is money is currently under attack as some senators want to shift as much as half of it to the Pentagon's budget.

Father-of-three Affleck, 42, founded the Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010 after making several trips to the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa and learning about the humanitarian crisis afflicting that war-ravaged region.

The nonprofit seeks to raise awareness and funding for local community-based groups that seek to support survivors of rape and sexual violence, return and reintegrate boy soldiers into their home communities, provide access to health care and education and foster economic opportunity.

Affleck spoke about the resurgence of the coffee industry in eastern Congo which had been destroyed during 20 years of war.

He said that Starbucks had agreed to purchase the entire first harvest of coffee beans - about 40 tones - produced by a cooperative supported by his nonpropfit organization.

'That's not a lot for Starbucks but it's a heckuva lot for the cooperative,' he said. 'This is good business.'

Farmer incomes have more than tripled, he said, and transformed lives in the eastern region of the embattled nation.

Pulling the American aid would be totally counterproductive, he warned, and revive 'a history of mistrust and disappointment' among Africans when it comes to promises made by America and other nations.

Gates, the Microsoft founder and co-chairman of the world's largest private foundation, was seated next to Affleck and also testified about the importance of foreign aid.

Affleck's actress wife, Jennifer Garner, and eldest daughter Violet, 9, were seated in the audience.

In an Instagram post earlier on Thursday, Affleck posted a photo of himself sitting on the ground talking with former boy soldiers.

'I made my first trip to Congo seven years ago after reading about the two decades of conflict the Congolese people had endured,' he wrote.

'I expected to find hopelessness, but the people I encountered, like these former child soldiers, were among the most courageous and resilient I could imagine.'

Despite the serious nature of the hearing, Affleck did manage to inject a little lighthearted humor into the proceedings and even got in a plug for his new movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

At the start of his testimony, the superhero star first acknowledged the Democratic Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy.

Leahy, 76, is a life-long Batman fan who has had cameos in Batman And Robin, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.

'I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge my costar in Batman,' Affleck said. 'The role is marginally smaller than mine, but I understand that you are quite good.'

The comment suggests that the senator will be making an appearance in Affleck's new film set for a 2016 release.

Serious business: Affleck put his jokey nature to one side as he passionately argued that billions of dollars of U.S. aid to Africa is making a real difference in helping rural communities escape hunger and poverty

Affleck was joined by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates for the hearing and both men urged the panel of Senators not to cut aid to Africa.

They both argued that U.S. foreign aid to Africa, which currently stands at more than $50 billion, is having a positive impact on the country and helping to make a real difference for those living in poverty and at risk of starvation.

Gates, the world's richest man, is the co-founder with his wife of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and one of the foundation's goals is to end African dependence on food imports within 15 years.

He said that U.S. aid is helping to improve agricultural productivity in poor rural areas which in turn is reducing the levels of hunger and poverty in those communities.
