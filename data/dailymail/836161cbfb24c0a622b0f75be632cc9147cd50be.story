Eva Longoria turned 
on the charm with her on-screen husband Ricardo Antonio Chavira tonight 
at a discussion panel about their show Desperate Housewives.

The
stunning actress, who plays Gabrielle Solis, worked up a chemistry with
Chavira - her husband Carlos in the ABC drama - as they attended a TCA 
press tour in Pasadena, California.

Eva,
36, who is dating 26-year-old actor Eduardo Cruz, laid an affectionate 
hands on her co-star throughout parts of the discussion.

Leggy lovely: Longoria put her perfect pins on display in a bright orange dress

At another interval, she grabbed hold of his bushy locks - apparently implying he was in need of a good haircut.

Eva looked beautiful in a bright orange dress, which showed off her lovely long legs.

She was joined by her co-stars, 
including Marcia Cross, Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and Vanessa 
Williams as they answered questions about the final season of the show.

Sweet
nothings: Eva joked that she would be surprised if Chavira's character 
turned out to be gay as they chatted about how the final season will end

Hatcher's on-screen husband James Denton was also in attendance.

After eight years, the gang are preparing to take their final bow later this year.

Creator Mark Cherry had been planning 
on doing a ninth season, but decided last year to end on season eight to
avoid the network pulling the plug sooner.

While the comedy drama used to viewing figures of around 25m per episode in its heyday, these days it barely gets 10m.

Cherry did say, however, there was a possibility of a Desperate Housewives reunion movie.

He revealed that he discussed the idea
with Sex And The City creator Patrick King a few years ago - but 
conceded King did have an advantage on him in making his movies.

Completing the set: Felicity Huffman and her on-screen husband Doug Savant

'Sex and the City only did like 69 episodes. The 
advantage for them was they hadn't really plumbed the depths of those 
characters,' Cherry explained.

'After eight years, I think we're done. 
I'm happy about it. It's not a bad thing. I feel very satisfied with 
where we are. I'm never sending these girls to Dubai. That's all I'm 
saying.'

Executive producer Bob Daily said that not every loose end will be tied up when the show comes to an end.

'We don't want to tie up every loose end,' he said, adding: 'Life goes on on Wisteria Lane.'

Cherry went on to tease that old 
familiar faces would be brought back, including Hatcher's on-screen 
daughter Julie (Andrea Bowen).

But asked if Nicollette Sheridan will 
return as Edie, Cherry replied: 'No comment,' hinting a return is not on
the cards following their bitter fallout.

Speaking about her relationship with 
Chavira, Longoria joked of his macho character: 'I wouldn't be surprised
if [Carlos] is going to be gay,' referring to the ups and downs of 
their relationship.
