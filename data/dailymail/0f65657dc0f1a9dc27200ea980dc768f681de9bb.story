Terminally ill star Lynda Bellingham made an emotional return to Loose Women for one final TV appearance, just days before her death.

The beloved actress, 66 - who lost her battle with  cancer on Sunday - filmed a special farewell episode of the ITV show, which will air on Wednesday.

Lynda - best known for her stint on the series and her longrunning role in the Oxo adverts - received a standing ovation from the audience as she walked out.

Brave: Lynda Bellingham filmed one final episode of Loose Women, the show she first joined in 2007, just days before her death 

The modest star, who wore a cheerful pink top and had her now purely white hair perfectly coiffed, refused to soak up too much praise, telling the crowd: 'Enough! We've got so much to chat about.

'We haven't time for this! And I do like to chat. Come on girls, ask me, what do you want to know?'

She then joined Coleen Nolan and Janet Street Porter on the sofa to discuss her decision to stop undergoing chemotherapy over the summer, a year after she was originally diagnosed with the disease in June 2013.

Although Lynda did her best to stay upbeat, Coleen - whose sister Bernie lost her battle with breast cancer last year - broke down in tears as she asked her pal how she'd like to be remembered.

Welling up, The Nolans star said: 'How would you... Oh, I'm going to cry... how would you like people to remember you?,' to which Lynda replied: 'Just an honest person.'

'We’ve been through this as Loose Women – you can’t do Loose Women unless you’re honest.

'You can’t hide anything, it really is honest when we answer questions...

'Trust is a huge thing. Not just as an actor, not just as a lover, not just as a wife, that trust thing. Just to say "you could trust her".'

In on especially moving moment, Lynda reached out to comfort a visibly upset Coleen, telling her: 'Please don’t cry... it will be fine!'

Heartache: Lynda's husband Michael also grew visibly upset as he listened to his wife talk

Among the audience was the actress' husband, Michael, who was also moved to tears by his wife's bravery.

Lynda sadly lost her battle with cancer on Sunday, when she passed away in the arms of her beloved husband. 

The 66-year-old star had been battling colon cancer, which later spread to her lungs and liver, since being diagnosed in July last year. 

In a statement on behalf of Bellingham's family, her agent, Sue Latimer, said on Monday morning: 'Lynda died peacefully in her husband's arms yesterday at a London hospital.

'Her family would like to thank the nurses and staff for their tremendous care and support. Actor, writer and presenter - to the end Lynda was a consummate professional.'

Lynda had previously been candid when it came to her decision to stop having treatment and her positivity while facing the fact she will die in the coming months.

She revealed that she wanted to have some control back over the remainder of her life after being left desperately ill by the gruelling chemo sessions.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning earlier this month, she explained: 'I just sat down when I was in pain - there's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon.

'When you're in terrible pain, you make decisions.'

Truth: The star has shared her experience in her tell-all new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You

Looking back: Lynda will also look back at her career, including her 16-year stint as they Oxo mum

The star has also detailed her experiences in moving new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell you.

The tome contains goodbye letters to her family. There is a joint message for her sons, Michael, 31, and Robbie, 26, in which she speaks of her regret over the chaotic existence they endured for years due to her violent marriage to their father Nunzio Peluso from 1981 to 1996.

She tells them of her sadness that she will not be part of their lives and admits that they might feel ‘cross’ about her stopping treatment.

But she adds: ‘If you have a little spirituality in you, believe I will be watching. When the moment comes to say goodbye let’s just hold hands and love each other, as we surely do.’

Lynda previously  insisted she wrote the memoir to take away some of the fear and mystery of her final days: 'My family and I have had lots of chats, time to talk - you realise sometimes when you are a parent you don't ever really talk to your children.

'As a society, we never talk about it, we never face it - even though it's everywhere. We must talk about death. Sit down, get your wills out the way.

'People spend their last few months worrying about death, but not pinpointing [what it is about death] they are worried about - rather than focusing on everything they've got.'
