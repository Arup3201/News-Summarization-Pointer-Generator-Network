For those social media addicts who 
cannot ‘eat’ before they ‘tweet’ and who base their restaurant choices 
on which venue’s dishes look the best on Instagram, there is now a 
potato product that panders to your obsession.

‘Mashtags’ are the latest product from Birds Eye and feature shapes including the iconic hashtag, @ symbols and emoticons.

With
 over 80 per cent of the country’s internet population now using some 
form of social network every day the cute potato shapes aim to tap into 
the ever-growing social media audience in the UK.

Mashtags will cost £1.75 and be available at Sainsbury's from February 23, and other retailers including ASDA and Tesco from March

Mashtags
 will cost £1.75 and be available at Sainsbury’s from February 23, and 
other retailers including ASDA and Tesco from March.

Pete
 Johnson, Senior Brand Manager at Birds Eye, comments: ‘The addition of 
Mashtags to our food range is an exciting development for Birds Eye. 
Social media is all about conversation and we’re confident Mashtags will
 resonate across various groups of people.

‘We’re
 constantly looking for ways to innovate and inspire consumers and hope 
that Mashtags will get people talking around the table and help to make 
mealtimes more enjoyable.’

If
 Mashtags aren't quite to your taste but you still enjoy quirky food experiences you can now spend over £300 for gourmet 
fish and chips - made with truffles and vintage champagne.

Dubbed the world's most expensive, they have gone on sale at £304 per portion - 95 times the average cost of a chip supper.

Top chef Simon Haigh, who trained under Raymond Blanc, created the gourmet dish with a twist to mark National Chip Week 2014.

The fish part of the dish comprises of two layers of sustainably sourced Dover Sole, with black truffle, and topped with a vintage Champagne batter

The fabulous fish supper will be served at Mallory Court, a country house restaurant near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire.

The
 Michelin starred-chef said he was interested coming up with a version 
of the classic supper 'with a twist' and tried to substitute ingredients
 for pricier alternatives.

The average chip shop spend is £3.20 but 
the de luxe version uses top of the range ingredients, including two 
layers of sustainably sourced Dover Sole, black truffle, topped with a 
vintage champagne batter.

The head chef is serving the fish with 
Maris Piper chips, pea puree, 100-year-old balsamic vinegar plus zest 
and puree from an oriental citrus fruit called yuzu.

Brits spend an 
average of £4.8 million a week on fish and chips, and 250 million meals 
are sold in the UK each year. More than half of people in the UK (56 per
 cent) said they buy fish and chips to eat at home as a family meal.

For £304 you can try the world's most expensive fish and chips (which  are made from the finest Maris Piper potatoes). The dish also comes with a pea puree, 100 year old balsamic vinegar and yuzu (an Oriental citrus fruit) puree and zest

Mr Haigh said: 'The recipe itself was trying to take something that is cheap and try and put a spin on it.

'It was just one of those things trying to make it as luxurious and expensive as we could.

'I was really trying to see what we could do with it and used different ingredients.

'So
 we replaced the beer in the batter with champagne, used more expensive 
fish, used an expensive citrus fruit called Yuzu from Japan. And 
truffles are still in season at the moment.

'I'm not actually sure whether anybody would actually stump up the money. Probably not many people I would think.

'But I've seen on TV they do the expensive burgers and that sort of thing.'

He
 added: 'Fish and chips are a national favourite and a key part of 
British tradition, so it made perfect sense to celebrate Chip Week with a
 unique and luxurious twist on the classic dish to match our style at 
Mallory Court.

'Sourcing sustainably is something we do on our day to day running of the restaurant.

'Dover Sole just happens to be one of the most expensive fish.

'It's
 about £20 a kilo, whereas cod is basically two-thirds of that price 
possibly even less. You've just got to be sensible when it comes to 
sourcing.'

Stu Baker, of the Potato Council, added: 'Fish and 
Chips are a fantastic value-for-money favourite and a staple British 
tradition, and to celebrate this we wanted to create the most sublime 
fish and chip dish of all time to celebrate Chip Week.

'The dish tastes phenomenal, but there's no need to pay £304 for a great experience at your local chip shop.

'Simon
 had great fun creating it but, at least here in Britain, we don't have 
to pay the same for the freshest takeaway available.'

Mr Haigh 
added: 'We probably could do a 99p fish and chips too, we would just 
have to make sure the ingredients are responsibly sourced.

'Like all 
dishes in our restaurant, this dish is cooked to order with the 
freshest, natural ingredients - much like fish and chips from your local
 chippy.'
