A father glumly contemplates a barbecue dotted with chargrilled sausages. Another arrives home to find his precious golf clubs strewn across the driveway. One ends up being hit in the crotch with a flying water pistol. The other steps on a toy rake with very painful consequences.

This is fatherhood Durex style, where far from enjoying father and son bonding or adoring looks from an admiring little daughter, becoming a daddy means facing a daily assault course of mess and annoyance - plus some excruciating injuries to the nether regions.

Now the condom manufacturer's dystopian vision of daddyhood has gone viral - perhaps driven by real-life fathers ruefully wishing they'd taken the Durex advice.

Misery: The father is hit in the face with a plastic sword followed by an even more painful strike to the crotch

Ruined: This father contemplates his wrecked golf clubs before being smacked in the crotch with a toy rake

Set to the sombre strains of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, the fashionably low-lit ad has already had more than 172,000 views on Youtube and begins with a miserable looking father wearily watching sausages burn on a barbecue.

He looks back to see his wife screaming at his squabbling children, who are busy flinging water at each other, before turning back to the grill with a grimace.

But things take a turn for the worse, when his son whacks him in the face with a plastic sword while another hoses both him and the barbecue down with a water pistol before the toy is thrown - hitting him painfully in the crotch.

Father number two wearily arrives home to find his driveway strewn with toys and rubbish, among which, to his horror, are his beloved golf clubs.

Argh! This naughty child knocks his father's hot cup of coffee straight into his lap

Relaxation? Forget it! There's no peace for this father but there is a body slam

As he turns away, sad-faced, he treads on the end of a toy rake which springs up and whacks himÂ  - where else - in his crotch.

Then comes a father who is trying to work from home, hindered by his small son who climbs up his chair smacking him on the head and making him drop his coffee.

Like his fellow fathers, the scalding coffee and cup drop straight onto his lap.

The final father is seen attempting to relax and watch TV while his children indulge in a pillow fight around him.

Giving up, he puts on his headphones and lies back to relax. But unbeknown to him, his son has scaled the side of the sofa and is preparing to remind men why they should wear a condom as he launches himself straight in to his daddy's most delicate region.
