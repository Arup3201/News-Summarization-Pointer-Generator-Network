Questions: Kristi Richardson, a 61-year-old trucking exec and grandmother, was last seen on October 6

Police and relatives are stumped over the disappearance of a 61-year-old grandmother who vanished from her home without her purse or cell phone two months ago.

All that was missing from Kristi Richardson's home when she failed to turn up for work in Casper, Wyoming on October 7 was an opener for her garage and a hooded sweatshirt. 

Richardson, the owner of a truck company who was recently widowed, had left her purse filled with cash and her ID on the kitchen counter. The doors were locked and nothing had been disturbed in the tidy house, which is in an affluent suburb of the city.

Her family believes someone is responsible for taking her, but police do not have enough evidence to call her disappearance a crime.

While authorities have released few details about the investigation, they have said they possible found traces of blood and urine found on her bed sheets, the Casper Star Tribune reported. Her cell phone was also found in her bed.

'The hard part of this case is that she is literally the only thing missing from her home,' Police Captain Steve Freel  told FoxNews.com. 'This is truly going back to 1950s police work.'

Richardson, a grandmother of five, was last seen on October 6 when she drove to her daughter's home, which is on the same block, to drop off a birthday card and visit her grandchildren.

Where is she? Captain Steve Freel speaks at a press conference on Thursday beside law enforcement officials members of Richardson's family as they offered a $25,000 reward for any information

Then later that day, at 7.45pm, she took a routine phone call from one of her drivers, Fox reported.

But the next call to her phone at 11pm went unanswered.

When she failed to go to work the following morning, her daughter, Amber Fazio, went to her mother's house using a spare garage opener but her mother was nowhere to be seen. 

'Nothing was disturbed,' Fazio said, adding that the doors were all locked. 'There was no sign at all of forced entry.' 

Freel said they are investigating whether Richardson might have been targeted by a current or former employee of Richardson Trucking, which she had owned with her late husband since 1979. 

He passed away in 2013.

They are also investigating competing companies but they are still not sure if a crime has been committed.

Authorities and loved ones have also searched the fields surrounding her east Casper home on multiple occasions, but have come up with nothing. There have also been air searches. 

The possible blood and urine stains are being tested but the results are not yet available. 

Her daughter Amber said she is convinced her mother was taken.

'I don't think that she did this on her own,' shetold Fox. 'She never left the house without using her car. My gut tells me that someone was there before she got home.'

At a press conference on Thursday, her family pleaded for information.

Last seen: Her home in Casper, Wyoming, pictured, was tidy when her daughter went to look for her. Only an opener for the garage and a sweater were missing, while her cell phone and purse remained inside

'This has obviously been an unprecedented time for our family and extremely difficult, and we would just ask anybody out there: Use your human compassion,' her daughter Tracy said. 'If you know anything about this, it would mean a lot to us if we could find out what happened to her.'

Richardson's family is also offering a $25,000 reward for any information leading them to the whereabouts of their mother.

The police department have set up a phone line for tips. Anyone with information is asked to call 307-235-8202.

The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation and the FBI are helping the Casper Police Department in the investigation.
