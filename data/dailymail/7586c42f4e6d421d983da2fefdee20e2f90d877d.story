Two young cheetahs at the Smithsonian National Zoo attacked and killed a deer that jumped into their enclosure on Friday, and it might not be the last since getting into the zoo is an easy feat for the wild animals that can clear fences more than 12 feet high.

Just a week before the deadly incident, another deer was spotted by park visitor Megan Dombi-Leis.

The 30-year-old Edgewater, Maryland resident was looking into the elephant enclosure when she saw an out-of-place deer and snapped its picture.

Too easy: Just a week before two cheetahs killed a white-tailed deer that got into their enclosure at the National Zoo, another deer was pictured in the elephant enclosure

She says the elephants weren't out at the time, so they went to see the giant beasts in their indoor enclosure.

Soon
 after, the elephants were released outside and by the time they went 
back to the place where the deer was spotted, it was gone.

Zoo officials told MailOnline that no witnesses were around when the white-tailed deer got into the cheetah enclosure last Friday.

There is a live stream available of the cheetah enclosure online, but the spokesman said it wasn't positioned where the attack took place.

A zookeeper finally found the deer after hearing noises coming from the cheetah enclosure.

Brother and sister cheetahs Justin and Carmelita were found next to the already dead deer's carcass.

Doctors will examine the deer to make sure it didn't have any diseases.

Zoo officials told the Associated press that the attack was a 'normal and expected reaction'.

Natural instinct: Sibling cheetahs Justin and Carmelita (pictured at three-months-old in 2012) have spent all their lives in captivity but still knew what to do when a deer jumped into their enclosure on Friday - kill it

According to the zoo spokesman, the cheetah enclosure is designed in a bowl-like fashion with a fence on the rim making it impossible for the cheetahs to escape since they're not good jumpers.

White-tailed deer however, can clear heights of up to 12 feet high. The cheetah enclosure is protected from the top of the bowl by a 12-foot fence, a moat and live wires, but the deer was still able to make its way over the fence and down into the pen.

But even for a deer, it would have been nearly impossible to escape since the tall fence was at the top of the enclosure.Â 

Stay away from the zoo: A similar incident happened in November 2009 at an adjacent zoo when a deer got into a lion enclosure. Above, the entrance to the National Zoo

Justin and Carmelita have been at the zoo for a little more than a year and a half.

The
 two were born through a risky cesarean section in April 2012 that ended
 up saving both the cubs' and mother's lives. The cubs were treated for 
several days in intensive care after their birth.

Three months later, the cheetah cubs made their debut at the zoo but had yet to be named.

The
 zoo partnered with USA Track & Field in the days leading up to the 
2012 Olympic Games and decided to name the brother and sister after the 
two American runners who placed highest in the 100-meter dash.

Justin Gatlin took home the bronze medal in the the race, and Carmelita Jeter won the silver medal.
