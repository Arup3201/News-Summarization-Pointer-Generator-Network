Cleared: David Cox, 49, who hit a motorbike and sidecar killing a married couple, has been cleared of causing death by careless driving after a court heard he choked on a sweet moments before the crash

A driver who hit a motorbike and sidecar killing a married couple has been cleared of causing death by careless driving after a court heard he choked on a sweet moments before the crash.

Kevin Byrne, 48, and his wife Carol, 49, both died in the crash on April 21 last year as they were making their way home to Rhayader in Powys, Wales, after a motorbike rally.

Driver David Cox, 49, had blacked out and said he had no 'accurate recollection' of his car crashing into the couple’s Yamaha as he drove the other way down the A458 Shrewsbury to Welshpool road in Shropshire.

Shrewsbury Crown Court heard moments before the collision Mr Cox suffered a coughing fit after getting a sweet given to him by his mother stuck in his throat.

His Vauxhall Astra crossed onto the opposite side of the dual carriageway before veering right and hitting the bike. The couple were both pronounced dead at the scene.

Prosecutors claimed that Mr Cox’s coughing fit started 'quite some distance' from the scene of the crash, and that he had failed to slow down or pull over and stop.

However, he told police he had been coughing and choking for 'about a minute' after being given a sweet by his mother, who was a front seat passenger

He was cleared of two charges of causing death by careless driving following a four-day trial and broke down in tears as the jury returned the verdicts on Friday.

Today, he refused to comment on the case back at his semi-detached bungalow in Atherstone, Warwickshire.

Thomas Kenning, prosecuting, had told the court that Mr Cox had chosen to try and keep steering the car after the coughing episode before losing control.

'The central issue was whether the defendant was in control of the car or was he driving without due care and attention,' he said.

'The prosecution say that when he was coughing or choking he should have taken measures to prevent the car going into the on-coming lane.'

However, giving evidence, Mr Cox sobbed in the witness box as he said he couldn’t remember the accident.

He also told the jury he was upset because of the loss of life and because he was unable to remember the detail of what had happened.

At the time of their deaths, the couple’s devastated family paid tribute to the devoted pair, who had first met as pupils of Llandrindod Wells High School, and went on to marry in July 1985..

In a statement issued through West Mercia Police, their two children Danny and Jodie, aged in their 20s, said: 'Kevin and Carol weren’t just brilliant parents, son, daughter, brother, sister, aunty and uncle - they were truly everyone’s best friends.

'Everyone could count on them, no matter what. Nothing was ever too much trouble.

'Mum and Dad always went to bike shows all around the country, up to 10 times a year and they loved it whatever the weather. Once summer was over, they would start planning next year’s events.

'They loved seeing the other bikes and bands. Dad would always come back with a trophy which he’d be so proud of. His bike was his pride and joy.'
