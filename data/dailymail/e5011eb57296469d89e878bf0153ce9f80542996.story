A flagship project launched by the Prime Minister is under investigation for allegedly misusing funds from taxpayers' money and charity pots to to pay off its directors and settle debts.

The beleaguered Big Society Network, which David Cameron launched with huge fanfare in 2010, has already been criticised for its dud projects, which were allegedly only approved because officials were pressured to change the rules.

And now the Charity Commission has launched its own probe into payments for 'consultancy' to a Tory donor and allegations huge payouts meant for doing good in the community were siphoned off to pay off creditors.

The payments were allegedly made to two directors of the charity and its chair Martyn Rose, a Conservative Party donor, the Independent reported.

The revelations have prompted Labour to call for a separate probe into allegations that charity officials were pressured to favour the Government's 'pet projects'.

News of the probe came days after a public spending watchdog issued a separate critical report about how National Lottery and Government funds were handed over to and used by the Big Society Network.

Shadow civil society minister Lisa Nandy said she was now asking the Cabinet Secretary to investigate whether 'political pressure' was exerted to secure money for ministers' 'pet projects'.

The Big Society Network was launched by David Cameron at 10 Downing Street two months after winning power in 2010, with the aim of encouraging the kind of community work and volunteering.

'Inappropriate': It has been alleged that charity officials were pressured to wave through 'pet projects'

But the performance of many of the projects it ran has been heavily criticised and the National Audit Office (NAO) exposed problems with how £2million worth of grants were handed over to it.

The NAO said the Big Lottery Fund failed to challenge BSN's 'ambitious' target to recruit a million members a year to one initiative despite meeting the target being crucial to its success.

The Your Square Mile Project was given an £830,000 lottery grant but eventually managed to attract just 64 members.

The grant was also allowed to be transferred to a new company set up by the BSN chairman and another director, without checking it had the IT skills to make the scheme work, the NAO said.

Its report also found that the £300,000 childhood obesity grant was made 'contrary to the Cabinet Office's own guidelines' and even though the SNF did not meet its criteria for funding.

The officials were allegedly told to 'go back and change the criteria'

The funding was halted after £200,000 had been handed over because of the project's poor performance, and the Cabinet Office did not recoup any of the funds.

Calls: Labour MP Lisa Nandy has called for an investigation into the Big Society Network

A Charity Commission spokeswoman confirmed that it was examining the Big Society Network's awarding and use of funds.

'Our case into the Society Network Foundation remains open and on going,' she said.

'We have received a response to questions we had relating to connected party transactions and the use of a grant however this does not fully address our concerns and we are in the process of engaging further with the trustees.

'We are also awaiting copies of documents that explain the grounds on which a grant was given.'

Mr Rose, who  contributed more than £54,000 to the 2010 Conservative election campaign, said he did not recall the payment from the Network but said that it was possible that 'one of my companies did work on its behalf'.

He said he put £200,000 of his own money into the Big Society Network which he had not got back and defended its operations.

'With hindsight, of course, if we had all known that the projects were not going to work we would have been idiots to do them,' he said.

'In the early stages of social investment some will work and some won't.'

In a further blow to the Big Society Network, a former trustee of a grants body claimed it was 'forced' to approve £480,000 of applications from the Big Society Network without asking for a pitch. 

The sum was given to the Big Society Network by innovation funders Nesta without a competitive pitch.

Nesta is now a private charity but was a government body at the time. 

Former trustee Liam Black said the awards were a 'scandalous waste of money'. 

Nesta told Civil Society News: 'While the vast majority of Nesta's grants are made following open calls for proposals, we do have the ability to provide grants to projects that fit with our vision and advance our objects outside of open calls for proposals.

'That is what happened with the grants to the Big Society Network. Nesta did not fund any of the projects highlighted in the NAO report.'

Ms Nandy said the entire Big Society project 'lies in tatters' and called for an investigation.

'It's bad enough that millions of pounds of public money were squandered, but the connections between these organisations and the Conservative party are deeply concerning,' she said.

'I am writing to Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood to ask him to investigate the process by which the grants in question were given.

'We must know if political pressure was applied to give an organisation with close ties to Ministers special treatment.

'At a time when many charities are fighting to survive, handing out large sums of money to flawed, pet projects is inexcusable.'

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'The awarding of this grant has been the subject of intensive investigation by Cabinet Office and independently by the NAO.

'Both investigations found no rules were broken and the matter is now closed.'
