The last ever class of cranes at a unique school designed to bring back one of Britain's rarest birds are ready to spread their wings after graduating.

Environmentalists at the Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire have spent ten weeks taking classes on foraging, feeding and making nests in the wild.

After passing their exams, the 16 young avian pupils from the class of 2014 are set to be introduced to a secret wetland location in Somerset.

Spreading their wings: The school is part of the Great Crane Project which hopes to restore Eurasian cranes to their former homes before they were driven to extinction in the 16th century by over-hunting and the loss of wetlands

Their graduation marks the end of a five-year initiative launched by the Great Crane Project to boost dwindling numbers of the common crane.

In 1980, there were just two wild cranes left in Britain - but through extensive conservation efforts, their population is slowly bouncing back. 

At Crane School, the birds were given daily exercise and taught how to forage and negotiate the wetlands that will become their wild home. 

Amy King, head teacher at the sanctuary, said: 'This year's Crane School class has really thrived.'

Dinner is served: Keepers at the centre take on the role of mother as they feed the chicks via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people

'They've loved their daily walks and this year we drafted in 40 volunteer PE teachers who took the birds for more than 700 hours of exercise.

'I've worked with the Great Crane Project since day one and it has been the most unforgettable experience.

'Some of the first birds that I raised have had chicks of their own now. It's just wonderful to know that they're out there, living wild in our landscape once again.'

The crane students are hatched from eggs taken from a healthy wild population in Germany.

The human teachers take on the role of their natural parents, guiding them through their first few months of life.

They wear grey hooded overalls to disguise their human form and feed them via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people.

Grub's up: The cranes were also taught how to find their food in an effort to prepare them for life in the wetlands of Somerset

Take off: A pair of young cranes attempt to fly before being introduced to the Somerset Levels and Moors, one of Britain's key wetland areas

After their ten-week course, the birds are taken to the Somerset Levels and Moors where they are introduced to a flock of previous Crane School graduates.

It is hoped the crane flock will start to grow naturally as birds reach maturity and start to breed before spreading across Britain.  

In 2013, environmentalists were left devastated following the death of the first wild crane to be hatched in Western Britain for four centuries.

Disaster also struck in June when two newborn chicks died.

The common crane is one of Europe’s largest birds with a wingspan of between 1.8 to 2.2 metres (pictured above is a young chick during a lesson using a prosthetic crane head) 

Damon Bridge, Great Crane Project Manager said: 'With this last class now on the Levels we're all looking forward to the next phase of the project with the cranes settling down to breed and raise youngsters in the wild.

'Putting these iconic birds back in this special place is so exciting.

It's a real boost not just for the crane population in the UK, but we hope a symbol of a bright future for the Somerset wetlands.'
