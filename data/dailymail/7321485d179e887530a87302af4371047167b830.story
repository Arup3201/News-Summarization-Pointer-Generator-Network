Robin van Persie's brace handed Manchester United 2-1 victory at Southampton. Van Persie ghosted onto Jose Fonte's loose backpass before flicking home Wayne Rooney's rangy free-kick to seal United's fifth-straight victory. Sportsmail's Ralph Ellis rated the players' performances at St Mary's on Monday night. 

Southampton (4-2-3-1)

Fraser Forster 5.5 

Staying on his line for second goal was a big mistake.

Nathaniel Clyne 6 

Only flashes of the form that has made him England’s new hope at right back.

Jose Fonte 5 

Recovered his composure well from schoolboy error that gifted United the lead, but the damage had been done.

Maya Yoshida 6 

Solid display in the heart of Southampton’s defence.

Ashley Young (right) struggled to make an impact in a wing-back role for Manchester United

Ryan Bertrand 6 

United’s wing-back system limited his chances to go forward.

Steven Davis 7

Quiet off the pitch but great energy on it, a driving run led to Pelle’s goal.

Victor Wanyama 6.5 

Important presence for Saints in midfield, broke up play.

Shane Long 6.5 

Switched to the right by Ronald Koeman to get at Ashley Young, the move worked a treat; missed great chance early in second half. Subbed after 78 minutes..

Dusan Tadic 6.5 

Superb touch to set up first goal, back to his best form from early season. Subbed after 70 minutes.

United midfielder Marouane Fellaini was at fault for Southampton's goal

Sadio Mane 6 

Too selfish wasting great first half chance, worked hard, but fortunate not to get sent off late on for bad foul on Van Persie.

Graziano Pelle 7

Great finish, and a first goal since mid-October saw his confidence flow back.

Subs

Jake Hesketh 6 (for Tadic, 70)

Emmanuel Mayuka 6 (for Long, 79)

Not used - K Davis, Gardos, Isgrove, Reed, Targett.

Manager

Ronald Koeman 6.5

His team knew their plan and were unlucky not to get some reward.

Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored a great goal and was a constant threat

Manchester United (3-5-2)

David de Gea 6.5 

Little to do until vital save protected the lead late on.

Paddy McNair 5 

Nervous and made a couple of errors before getting subbed after only 38 minutes.

Chris Smalling 5.5 

Limped off injured from a clash with Tadic after only 16 minutes.

Marcos Rojo 6 

Lacked authority at the back, way below his World Cup form.

Antonio Valencia 5.5 

Fish out of water at wing back, uncertain whether to attack or defend.

Michael Carrick, 6 .5 

Dropped into defence when McNair went off, his experience brought an improvement. 

Robin van Persie had all three of United's attempts on goal and scored twice

Juan Mata 4.5 

Subbed after 88 minutes, the game had completely passed him by – one of those nights to remind why Jose Mourinho sold him.

Marouane Fellaini 5 

Mistake that gave away Southampton equaliser was one of far too many sloppy passes.

Ashley Young 5.5 

Ditto comment for Valencia. Worked hard but should be able to offer so much more.

Wayne Rooney 6.5 

Not enough space or possession – but free kick for second goal made the difference.

Robin van Persie 8 

Vintage finish for the first goal – and the second wasn’t bad either.

Victor Wanyama broke up play and was one of Southampton's best players on the night

Subs

Jonny Evans (for Smalling, 16) 6

Ander Herrera (for McNair, 38) 6

Darren Fletcher (for Mata, 89) 

Not used: Falcao, Januzaj, Lindegaard, Wilson.

Manager

Louis van Gaal: 7 

Took tough decision to sub struggling McNair early, his half time talk improved the performance.
