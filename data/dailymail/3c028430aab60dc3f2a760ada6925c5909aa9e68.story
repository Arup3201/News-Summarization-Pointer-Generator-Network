Celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito has told how he managed to lose 41lbs by ditching his unhealthy lifestyle, which saw him eat up to ten entrees during tasting sessions and drink 'too much alcohol'.

The 47-year-old revealed to People magazine that his 6ft 1in frame used to tip the scales at 226lbs, causing his cholesterol and blood pressure levels to go through the roof.

In a bid to slim down and get healthy he developed a weight-loss plan that restricted his calorie intake to 850 during weekdays and 1,200 at weekends.

After 28 days he then transitioned to a Mediterranean-style diet - emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and 'good' fats to promote a healthy heart.

Coining it 'The Pound a Day Diet' he is set to release a dieting book under the same name next week.

'Everyone thinks I look younger,' he exclaimed. 'Some people think I had plastic surgery, which I take as a compliment.'

Along with cutting back on portion sizes he also started working out twice a day.

What's his secret? In a bid to slim down and get healthy he developed a weight-loss plan that restricted his calorie intake to 850 during weekdays and 1,200 at weekends

Instantly the self-described former 'chubby chef with a crooked spine and flat feet,' lost 10lbs which spurred him on to lose more.

Three months later he completed his first sprint triathlon. A year later in 2009, and 30lbs lighter, he completed a  70.3 mile-long Ironman.

Now four years on he has managed to maintain his slimmer physique and touts his diet as something sustainable on a long-term basis.

He told TV host Piers Morgan last month: 'If I can do it, anyone can do it . . . I am surrounded by the most delicious food available on the planet every day of my life.'

Along with the threat of heart disease the born and bred New Yorker said his waning love life also prompted the shift.

'My sex wasn't as good as it should be. I went to the doctors and he was like, "Well you're about 40lbs overweight"'.

But now the culinary whizz, who specializes in Italian-American dishes, says he has a newfound sense of confidence and doesn't get insecure about 'how a shirt fits' anymore.

While he is confident that his Pound A Day Diet is the key to fighting the bulge, some critics have deemed it as 'too restrictive' and 'unhealthy.'

Indeed, Keri Gans, who reviewed the eating manual for Shape magazine wrote: 'The title of this book alone bothers me. No one - I repeat, no one - should be looking to lose a pound a day.

'First off, it isnâ€™t healthy. Let's be honest, 850 calories is way, way too few. Even 1,200 calories is low for the average women who is engaging in any sort of moderate-intensity excercise. Sure you will lose weight, but at what cost mentally and physically?

'Research shows that rapid weight loss (anything more than one to two pounds per week) may lead to gallstones, dehydration, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalances.

'Other possible side effects include headaches, irritability, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, menstrual irregularities, hair loss, and muscle loss.'

Dishes featured in Mr DiSpirito's plan include salmon teriyaki with grapefruit which stacks up to 200 calories and an egg-white omelet with reduced-fat cheddar cheese which rings in at only 70 calories.

'It makes a great breakfast or a snack,' the former Dancing With The Stars contestant noted.

It's not the first time Mr DiSpirito has released a calorie-conscious cookbook, and Now Eat This! Italian: Favorite Dishes from the Real Mamas of Italy - All Under 350 Calories went on to become a New York Times best-seller.
