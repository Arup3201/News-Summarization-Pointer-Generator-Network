Unlikely victim? Grace Meng, the congresswoman from New York's 6th district, was struck on the back of the head Tuesday night and then robbed near Capitol Hill

A congresswoman from New York was attacked near Capitol Hill on Tuesday evening and robbed of her belongings.

The attacker struck Representative Grace Meng, a 38-year-old Democrat from the state’s 6th congressional district, on the back of the head around 8:30pm, causing her to fall to the ground.

While she was down and disoriented, the attacker then snatched the mother of two’s Gucci purse. Meng soon found Capitol police, who had her transported to George Washington University Hospital.

The mugging took place at the intersection of 6th and Pennsylvania Avenue in Southeast D.C., a highly populated area with many restaurants and business.

Meng was on her way home after having dinner nearby when she was mugged.

‘They came from behind. I didn't see anyone,’ she said.

Meng said she didn't know if she was mugged by more than one person. She said police had recovered an old phone that was discarded from her purse and pulled fingerprints from it. She said she's never been mugged before.

‘I have not — you know, I'm from New York City and I have not been mugged like that,’ she said.

According to ABC News, Meng suffered a bruise on her chin and underwent a CAT scan to check for brain injury.

She was evidently given the okay, because by Wednesday Meng was back at work.

‘While this was a frightening ordeal, I fortunately was not seriously injured,’ Meng said in a statement. ‘Obviously, things could have been much worse.’

The freshman congresswoman also thanked authorities who came to her aid.

‘I thank the U.S. Capitol Police and the District of Columbia Police for responding quickly and professionally,’ she said.

As of Wednesday evening, no arrests had been made.

Meng was elected in 2012 and is the first Asian American to represent New York in Congress.

She is also the first female to represent Queens since former Vice Presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
