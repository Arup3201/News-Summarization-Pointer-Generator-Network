A 16-year-old boy has called cops to his home after his father shot dead his mother while he and his two younger siblings were in the house, police have said.

Daniel Fink, a 41-year-old Customs and Border Patrol officer, allegedly shot his estranged wife, Aide Fink, 50, multiple times at their home in Flower Mound, Texas at 12.20am on Thursday.

Mrs Fink had filed for divorce from her husband last month and, just hours before her death, he had filed a restraining order against her to stop her from taking their assets, NBC 5 reported.

The couple's children, aged seven, 11 and 16, were at home when he opened fire on their mother but they were unharmed. It is not known if they witnessed the shooting but the oldest child called 911.

'Gunman': Daniel Fink, 41, allegedly shot dead his estranged wife, Aide Fink, while their children, aged between seven and 16, were at home. One of the children then alerted cops, who arrested Fink at the scene

Mrs Fink was rushed to a nearby hospital but she was pronounced dead.

Neighbors said they saw Daniel Fink being taken away from the home.

One neighbor, Brian Freed, expressed his sadness over the death. 

'A neighbor you've known for several years, a good family, is not a family anymore,' he told NBC 5. 'You have three kids that won't grow up with a mom or a dad. You're sad for them'

The three children are now in the custody of Child Protective Services.

There had been prior calls to the Fink's home, but no charges or criminal offenses were ever brought in those incidents, NBC 5 reported. 

Court records obtained by the channel show the couple separated on August 1 and Mrs Fink filed for divorce three days later. Her divorce petition was served to her husband while he was working at DFW Airport.

Probe: Investigators collect evidence from the scene on Thursday, hours after the shooting

Fink is employed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, police said.

On Wednesday, his attorney filed a counter petition, including a request for a restraining order against his wife in a bid to stop her taking the assets or their children out of Texas. 

A hearing was scheduled in the case on Thursday, but it was cancelled.

The couple, who had been married for 13 years, lived in an upscale neighborhood near to the tow's center. The town has a population of about 65,000.
