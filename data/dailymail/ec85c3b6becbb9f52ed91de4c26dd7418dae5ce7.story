An Australian reality TV star and socialite was jailed for at least 11 years today after stabbing his girlfriend repeatedly in a 'Romeo and Juliet scenario' where he wanted them to die together.

Joel Betts, 32, held his girlfriend Samantha Holland hostage in their apartment after she broke up with him, before knifing her nearly 30 times so they 'could die together and be together for eternity'.

Miss Holland, 25, only survived the attempted murder in April 2010 by convincing Betts to hand her the knife mid-attack.

After the knife had plunged into her back and neck more than two dozen times, Miss Holland 'acquitted herself with great courage and intelligence' by convincing Betts, whom she had recently broken up with, to give her the knife so they could 'die together' in a Romeo and Juliet-type scenario.

Sydney District County Court heard that, bleeding and wearing only her underwear, Miss Holland miraculously escaped the savage knife attack by swinging off the balcony of the third-floor apartment on to the balcony of the apartment below.

The judge said that Betts 'intended that she was not going to leave the apartment alive. She was going to die at his hands.'

The court had heard that Miss Holland told Betts as he was stabbing her: 'If we're going to die together, then I should have a turn with the knife.'

Betts was well known in Australian showbusiness circles following his appearance as a contender on Australian Survivor and as a presenter on cable TV.

He was also seen in Sydney's night-time venues and was regarded as a 'man about town'.

As a packed gallery listened in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, Judge Toner said: 'This was a sustained and deliberate attempt to kill Miss Holland.'

'It was, as the victim (who survived) so eloquently put it, 'a scarifying experience'.'

Judge Robert Toner branded Betts's crime as 'vile' and said Ms Holland will live with the 'psychological trauma' of what happened to her for the rest of her life.

He told the court: '(The attack) must have felt like an eternity to her, beyond anything she could have ever imagined.'

The court heard that at the time of the attack, in April, 2010, Miss Holland, who had broken up with Betts, had returned to the apartment to collect her belongings when he confronted her, asking her to stay.

When she refused, he stabbed her up to eight times before turning the knife on itself, inflicting serious wounds to his stomach. Then he stabbed Miss Betts a further 20 times.

'I want us to die together so we can be together for eternity,' he told her during the attack.

A note found in the apartment later roughly quoted Bon Jovi lyrics - 'you know that I love you but I hate you because I know I can never replace you.'
