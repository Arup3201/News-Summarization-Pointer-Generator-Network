Firefighters responding to a domestic fire got a shock when they were confronted by dozens of exotic snakes - some of them venomous.

Among the 28 reptiles discovered in the house in North Davis, Utah, were six deadly species - including a Gaboon viper, which is widely considered one of the world's deadliest.

Usually found in the jungles of Africa, Gaboon vipers have the highest venom yield of any venomous snake and fangs which commonly measure up to two inches long.

Possession of venomous snakes is illegal in Utah and the owner of the house, whose name has not been released, could now face misdemeanour charges.

Local fire chief Mark Becraft told ABC News: 'We always have a search team go in to clear the house and make sure there are no humans.

'They came out with an all clear but said that there were numerous snakes caged in the house ... They definitely didnâ€™t want to handle them.'

The spooked firemen called in the 
local Animal Control, who handed the issue over to the state's Division 
of Wildlife. Chief Becraft added that he was 'sure glad to hand it to 
someone else to deal with.'

As well as the Gaboon viper, the haul of serpents included five albino western diamondbacks, an American species the venom of which causes necrosis - the premature death of cells in living tissue.

Gaboon viper venom also causes necrosis, but is less potent. However the volume of venom it injects into a victim means that any bite must be considered a serious medical emergency.

Brad Hunt of the Utad Division of Wildlife told ABC News: 'The Gaboon viper is considered one of the most dangerous snakes in the world.

'It has very long fangs and very potent venom.' Anti-venom for Gaboon vipers is not readily available in the U.S.

Officials believe the owner of the house is a snake professional or breeder, and suspect that at least the Gaboon viper was smuggled from outside the state.

Clint Thacker, Director of Davis County Animal Services, told ABC that the snakes were kept in immaculate conditions.

The confiscated western diamonbacks were given to an animal rescue centre specialising in rehabilitating snakes and reptiles which the Gaboon viper is being kept by the Division of Wildlife while authorities continue their investigation.

However, the remaining 22 legally owned snakes will be returned.
