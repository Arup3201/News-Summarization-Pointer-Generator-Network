A New York father who has spent 18 months desperately trying and failing to rescue his two sons from Uruguay after they were kidnapped by his wife will shortly return to the United States.

Guy Brunetti, 47, from Eastchester, flew to the South American country after his 42-year-old spouse, Ivanna Soto, then pregnant, abducted their toddler son, Octavio, now three, in May 2013.

For the past year and a half, he has been fighting for the legal right to rescue Octavio, as well as his younger son, Luciano, whom he has never met and would now be 14 months old.

But now, Mr Brunetti plans to return to the US within a month after an appeals court in Montevideo ruled he would not have the right to have Luciano brought back if he is ever found.

Desperate: Guy Brunetti, 47, has spent 18 months desperately trying and failing to rescue his two young sons, including Octavio (center), from Uruguay after they were abducted by his wife, Ivanna Soto (right) in May 2013

Devoted: Mr Brunetti (pictured with Octavio before his abduction), from Eastchester, New York, flew to the South American country after his 42-year-old spouse,  then four months' pregnant, fled there in May 2013

Missing: For the past year and a half, the father has been fighting for the legal right to rescue Octavio (pictured), as well as his younger son, Luciano, whom he has never met and would now be 14 months old

However, despite the ruling, the devoted father has vowed to not give up his $70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'.

In a phone interview with The Journal News, he said: 'I'll probably come home to go to Washington and do some leg work there in the United States, then probably head back to Uruguay.' 

Last year, Mr Brunetti, who has been fighting for his sons while living in a Montevideo-based room that he rents weekly, was granted the right to have Octavio returned to the US by an appeals court.

However, upon hearing of the decision, Ms Soto, a Uruguay native, dropped all contact with her husband and fled with their two sons. She is now a fugitive sought by Interpol.

'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti told ABC News. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day. It's a situation that no parent should have to go through.'

Mr Brunetti started dating Ms Soto in 2009 after first meeting her in 1997. The pair initially lived in Uruguay, where they married and had Octavio, before moving to Eastchester for financial reasons.

Escape: Mr Brunetti has vowed to not give up his $70,000-plus fight to have his two children returned to New York, saying: 'I've hit a wall [but] the battle continues'. Above, Ms Soto fled from New York to Uruguay

On May 22, 2013, when Ms Soto was four months' pregnant, Mr Brunetti, an auto parts wholesaler, came home to find his wife had fled with Octavio. He flew to Uruguay and begged her to return.

Having no luck, he filed a motion under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to have his son returned to the US. The motion was granted on October 2, 2013. 

On November 27 this year, he lost a second legal battle to have the right to have Luciano returned.

It remains unclear why Ms Soto initially fled the US, nor why she did not inform her husband. 

Happier times: 'It's unexplainable,' Mr Brunetti said of his desperate fight to rescue his sons. 'It's this torture I live with every second, every minute, every hour of the day.' Above, Mr Brunetti with Octavio as a baby

Fight: Mr Brunetti's fight has gained widespread support from friends, relatives and members of the public. In addition to a Bring Octavio Home Facebook page (pictured), there is a dedicated gofundme.com page

Mr Brunetti's fight has gained widespread support from friends, relatives and members of the public. 

In addition to a Bring Octavio Home Facebook page, there is a dedicated gofundme.com page.

On the page, Mr Brunetti says his wife and sons could potentially have fled to Brazil, Paraguay or Argentina, and that the hunt for the trio has been a 'huge blow' both financially and emotionally.

'I feel I'm alone fighting because of all the complications of the police, the governments,' the father said, adding that the public's response to his social media campaigns has greatly lifted his spirits.
