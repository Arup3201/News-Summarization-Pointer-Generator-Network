A housewife tried to murder a five-year-old boy by dragging him into the path of an oncoming train, a court has heard.

Radhika Sharma, 35, jumped in front of a locomotive as horrified commuters looked on at one of London’s busiest stations.

The driver slammed on the brakes but was powerless to stop the pair disappearing from view, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told.

Both miraculously escaped uninjured when the engine passed harmlessly overhead and its wheels failed to hit them.

The emergency services were called to the scene at Stratford station, east London, where Sharma allegedly explained to a paramedic that she had only been trying to kill herself.

She had been spoken to by police earlier that day for allegedly grabbing the boy and swinging him in front of an oncoming train at Forest Gate station, east London.

CCTV showed the 2.44pm service on June 10 last year being forced to brake hard to avoid hitting the child, it was said.

The defendant allegedly claimed he had been playing on the railings when he almost fell and she had to reach out and catch him.

She then boarded a train to Stratford with the boy, arriving at 3.09pm.

Lisa Matthews, prosecuting, played jurors CCTV footage of the entire sequence of events.

She said: ‘At 3.09pm the defendant got off the train at Stratford and moved to the edge of platform five.

‘About four or five minutes later, she was seen on CCTV to walk off the edge of the platform, directly in front of an approaching train.

'Police and ambulance were called but neither she nor the child was hurt.

‘Kirsten Wright, a trainee paramedic, talked to her on the tracks and she said she didn’t want to be there. When asked if she had done it on purpose, she said yes.

‘At Newham Hospital she told doctors her husband had requested a divorce and that she left the family home.’

Giving evidence train driver Richard Roscoe said he was only travelling at 10 to 15 miles an hour as he pulled into Stratford station.

He said: ‘I saw an Indian woman standing fairly close to the yellow line on the platform.

‘As I approached, she started walking straight ahead as if she was going to board the train. I didn’t see anyone else there.

Claims: The 35-year-old allegedly told a paramedic that she had only been trying to kill herself

‘She walked straight up to the yellow line, looking straight ahead, then just stepped out. She went down into the tracks - I did think I’d hit her, I didn’t feel any bump or hear any noise.

‘I put the train straight into emergency mode so the brakes locked. The first I knew about the boy was when the paramedics said he was still alive.’

After she jumped onto the tracks, 
Sharma was taken to the Newham University Hospital in Plaistow for 
psychiatric assessments and found not to have any mental illness.

But
her condition deteriorated after her arrest and she was later admitted 
to the John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, with severe 
depression.

Sharma, of Forest Gate, east London, denies attempted murder and two counts of child cruelty or neglect.

The trial continues.
