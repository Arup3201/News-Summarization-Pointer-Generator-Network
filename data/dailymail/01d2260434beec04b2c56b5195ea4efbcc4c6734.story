Shanesha Taylor, 35, denied using $114,000 in donations  to buy designer clothes and finance her boyfriend's rap album

A mother who left her young sons in a hot car while she went for a job interview has denied squandering $114,000 in donations received after the story attracted public sympathy.

Shanesha Taylor, 35, from Phoenix, Arizona, who is still unemployed, said she has not used the money to finance her boyfriend's rap album and buy designer clothes.

The mother-of-three insisted she could not afford to put any of the money into a trust fund for her children, saying the idea was 'not realistic'.

'I am here to make sure their needs are provided for,' said Ms Taylor.

'But will I set aside a large amount of money for 16, 18 years that we need to get by today? That's not realistic.'

Her trial on child abuse charges had been expected to start Wednesday, as she had previously pleaded not guilty, but a judge rescheduled it for February.

Ms Taylor became an Internet sensation after her tear-stained mugshot was published following her arrest for leaving her two-year-old and six-month-old in a 100F car.

She received $114,000 in donations, but missed the deadline to set aside the $60,000 for her children's trust fund, a sum which was initially agreed with prosecutors.

'Any money spent has gone to housing, clothes, car payments as well as fast-food outings and birthday parties,' said Ms Taylor.

'I'm not the type of person to go out and finance someone's rap album.

'Yes, I threw them birthday parties because they haven't had birthday parties in years,' she said. 'I took care of Thanksgiving dinner because my mother couldn't afford to take care of that.'

Ms Taylor was arrested on March 20 after leaving her two young sons in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company.

Police said the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off and the fan was blowing hot air

A witness found the six-month-old crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV exceeded 100F.

Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries.

They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision.

She struck a deal with prosecutors in July that allowed her to avoid prosecution if she fulfilled a number of requirements, such as setting up the trust funds, taking parenting classes and completing a substance-abuse treatment program.

Ms Taylor's story split public opinion between those who are supportive of a mother on food stamps trying to get ahead any way she knows how and those who believe she should never put her kids in danger
