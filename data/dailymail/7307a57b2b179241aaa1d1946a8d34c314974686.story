Ronny Deila believes attack will be Celtic's best form of defence against Inter Milan in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie at Parkhead on Thursday night.

The Hoops boss was speaking after the 2-1 Scottish Premiership win over St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park which extended the league leaders' winning run to eight games.

Striker Leigh Griffiths opened the scoring after 35 seconds, beating the debut goal from Gary Mackay-Steven against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night by three seconds.

Midfielder Stefan Johansen doubled the visitors' lead seven minutes after the break before Perth midfielder Michael O'Halloran reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute to end Craig Gordon's eight-game clean sheet run.

It ensured a nervy finale in which Gordon made a fine double-save from substitute Brian Graham and skipper Dave Mackay as the Hoops went six points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table.

Deila - who believes midfielder Kris Commons, who missed out again with a hamstring injury, 'is going the right way and has a chance' of making the Inter game - insists he will not change his side's pressing game for Europe.

The Norwegian said: 'We always attack, so nothing is changing. Why should we do that?

'We are at home. We are attacking but we haven't conceded a goal (until today) so I think that is a very good way to protect yourself.

'We will be ourselves but we will know their weaknesses and strengths.'

Deila was unconcerned by losing a goal after eight shut-outs.

The former Stromsgodset boss said: 'It doesn't mean anything to me.

'I am counting points and that is the most important thing. We are defending well and they didn't have many chances today.

'Otherwise, I think we had control of the game.

'In the end there was pressure on us, especially from set-pieces which were good and Gordon made very good saves.

'We played well for 60 minutes, were intense in our pressure, aggressive and created chances.

'We are much more direct now and we take more of the (chances) than we did before but we lost the ball too much as well, so we have to work on that.'

St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright rued the loss of the early goal and praised Gordon for his late double save.

The Northern Irishman, who revealed midfielder Murray Davidson had been taken off in the 15th minute with a calf injury which will be assessed on Monday, said: 'I thought it was quicker than the goal they scored against Partick.

'We had emphasised the point that we had to start well against them.

'I think it is a quality pass and good movement. I haven't watched it back but I think we could have done better.

'We weathered a storm, Alan Mannus made some good saves and we got back in the game.

'We were much better in the second half and we could have easily got a draw at the end but for two tremendous saves from Craig Gordon.'
