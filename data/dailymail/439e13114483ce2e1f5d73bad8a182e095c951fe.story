Discovered: The body of Kosta Karageorge was found on Sunday in a dumpster two blocks from his Columbus, Ohio, apartment

Missing Ohio State football player, Kosta Karageorge, has been found dead in a dumpster, days after sending his mother cryptic texts apologizing for being 'an embarrassment' because of his repeated concussions.

Police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said police received a call around 2:30 p.m. from someone reporting a body found in the trash bin in Columbus.

Weiner said a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body, which had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

'At this time we are able to confirm through tattoos here at the scene that it is the body of Kosta Karageorge,' Weiner said.

Weiner also revealed that a handgun was recovered from the dumpster.

Police found the body near the campus after a search began when Karageorge went missing Wednesday. The senior defensive tackle had last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk.

Susan Karageorge told police she had received a text from her son about 1:30am on Wednesday that said, 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.' 

The body was found within a couple hundred yards of Karageorge's home and about a half block from High Street, the main artery of the campus. Sunday evening, no one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the metal door of Karageorge's apartment.

Karageorge's parents filed a missing-person report Wednesday evening, and his mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused, according to the report. She said that at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message apologizing and saying the concussions had messed up his head. 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment,' he said.

The team's physician said he's confident in the policies in which athletes are returned to play after injury

A woman answering the phone Sunday at Susan Karageorge's home identified herself as a friend and said that neither Susan Karageorge nor other family members had any comment.

University athletic officials said they were grieved to learn of Karageorge's death.

'It's hit the team hard,' team spokesman Jerry Emig said.

Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said in a text message when asked about any plans to honor the player or logistics for the team to attend the funeral that it was too soon to answer those questions. The Buckeyes will play Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

A former Ohio State wrestler, Karageorge joined the football team as a walk-on this season. He played in one game and was among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at the final home game Saturday against rival Michigan. The Buckeyes won, 42-28.

Around 200 volunteers swarmed the streets in search of Karageorge on Saturday.

'I'm very scared for him,' he told The Columbus Dispatch. 'I'm worried. I'm trying to remain optimistic. We love him, and we want him home.'

Webber urged anyone that may have seen him to contact police.

'If you think you saw a 6'5', 250lb man, there aren't many out there. Chances are, it's him,' he said. 

His appeal came as a group of former Ohio State players tweeted their offer of a $1,000 cash reward for information that leads to Karageorge, who also goes by his middle name Alex.

Ohio State University's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out his name and the missing poster appeared on the scoreboard.  

The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices.

His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused.

The team's physician insists the squad would not have let Karageorge play after injury or illness if he weren't ready. 

Karageorge was last seen at his apartment around 2 am Wednesday, his sister, Sophia Karageorge told The Columbus Dispatch.

Roommates said he appeared upset and went for a walk, dressed in a black hat, black sweater, black pants, and black boots.

Ohio State coach Urban Meyer described Karageorge as a hard worker and an important player in practice.

'Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Kosta Karageorge, and we pray that he is safe and that he is found soon,' Meyer said in a Friday statement.

Karageorge, a former Buckeyes wrestler, joined the football team as a walk-on this season.

He has played in one game and is among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at their final home game Saturday against rival Michigan.

Karageorge's sister said he left without his wallet or his motorcycle. He has a history of concussions, including one a month ago, and might have become disoriented, she said.

'We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on,' she told the newspaper. 

She said after each concussion, he has followed trainers' instructions and received proper care, but 'his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed.'

The team's physician, Dr Jim Borchers, said Friday that he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes.

But, Boarches said, 'We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.'

The Dispatch reports that about 100 people gathered Friday afternoon in Columbus to post fliers with the player's photo and description.
