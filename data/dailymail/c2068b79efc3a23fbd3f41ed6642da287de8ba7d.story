Rafael Nadal has joined Novak Djokovic in qualifying for the end-of-season Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London.

The tournament, held at the O2 Arena from November 9-16, features the best eight players of the year and offers Nadal another chance to win the biggest title still to elude him.

The Spaniard has qualified for a 10th straight year, although he has been unable to play three times because of injury, with his best results being runner-up finishes in 2010 and last year, when he lost to Djokovic.

Djokovic leads the way this year by virtue of winning his second Wimbledon title, which also saw him usurp Nadal as world number one.

ATP executive chairman and president Chris Kermode said: 'Rafa's qualification for this year's Barclays ATP World Tour Finals is terrific news for tennis fans in the UK.

'They now have another chance to see a true sporting icon battle it out for the last title of the season.'

Wimbledon runner-up Roger Federer 
currently sits in third place but is more than 2,000 points behind Nadal
 while Andy Murray is seventh and has a lot of work to do to book his 
place at the O2.

The 36-year-olds have qualified for a 13th consecutive time but have not won the title since the tournament's first year in London in 2009.
