He is one of the most chilling and grimly fascinating characters to ever hit the silver screen.

For decades the exploits of Dr Hannibal Lecter - brilliant psychiatrist, serial killer, cannibal - has thrilled moviegoers and, more recently, in a critically-acclaimed hit TV series.

Now author Robert Harris, the monster's creator, has revealed the identity of the real life man who inspired him - a gay Mexican doctor who murdered his lover and was consumed by guilt over it until his dying day.

The real-life Hannibal Lecter: Alfredo Balli Trevino was Thomas Harris' inspiration for his most famous creation

Harris met the doctor at the  Nuevo Leon State Prison, at Monterrey, Mexico, as a 23-year-old journalist. The author was at the prison to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a former mental patient who was under the death sentence for killing three people.

But he met 'Dr Salazar' after learning he had apparently saved the life of Simmons when he had been shot during an attempt to escape from the prison about a year earlier.

The true identity of 'Dr Salazar' has now been revealed as Alfredo Balli Trevino, who died in 2009 at 81.

Harris met him in 1963 while Balli Trevino was serving 20 years for the murder of his lover Jesús Castillo Rangel. A medical intern at the time, he had slit Rangel's throat with a scalpel in a 'crime of passion' and cut his body into pieces and buried them to hide his crime.

The body parts were unearthed by the victim's suspicious uncle.

In The Times on Saturday, Harris described the inspiration for Lecter as 'a small, lithe man with dark red hair. He stood very still and there was a certain elegance about him.'

Reporters went to Balli Trevino's former neighbourhood, where residents were reluctant to speak of him.

A local man confirmed that he had worked from a small clinic where he cared for poor people and two men said they had received treatment from Balli Trevino, who they described as a 'good person' who never charged them for treatment.

A year before his death, Balli Trevino gave an interview to a local newspaper - on the condition his crime would not be discussed.

He said: 'If you want we can talk about anything you’d like, except for that. I don’t want to relive my dark past. I don’t want to wake up my ghosts, it’s very hard,' he said.

'I don’t remember how many years I’ve been a doctor. Now I take care of the... the elderly like me.'

Harris described how the 1963 interview with Balli Trevino
took a dark twist when the doctor began questioning the 
journalist on Simmons's disfigured appearance, the nature of torment and
the murderer's victims.

It was
not until Harris left the doctor's office that he learned of Dr 
Salazar's history from the prison warden. The doctor was a murderer and the warden told Harris: 'He will never leave this place. He is insane.'

Harris says the doctor provided the inspiration behind his most famous creation.

He
explained while writing his novel he needed to create a character with a
'peculiar understanding of the criminal mind', adding: 'It was not Dr 
Salazar. But because of Dr Salazar, I could recognise his colleague and 
fellow practitioner, Hannibal Lecter.' 

Lecter was first introduced by Harris in the 1981 novel Red Dragon, where he was depicted as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibal.

He became part of cinematic history however when Hopkins portrayed the character in the Silence of the Lambs, winning an Academy Award for the part along the way.

It was in this film that he delivered the immortal line: 'I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti'.

In the film Lecter questions a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling about her childhood traumas, in a scene which is eerily reminiscent of Harris's depiction of his encounter with Dr Salazar.

The first film adapted from Harris's novels was Manhunter, which was based on Red Dragon and featured Brian Cox as Lecter.

Hopkins reprised the role however in 2001's Hannibal, where Lecter became the main character of the film.

He also played Lecter in a second adaptation of Red Dragon in 2002. The most recent incarnation of Lecter was the NBC series Hannibal, as portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen.

The character was chosen as the number one movie villain by the American Film Institute in 2003.
