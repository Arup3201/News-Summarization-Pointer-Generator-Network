For Chicago-born bride Rachael Kay Albers and her fiancé Roberto Hess, one wedding was never going to be enough for them to say how much they truly loved each other.

So, after canceling their traditional wedding, the couple agreed to say 'I do' to each other every day for a whole year.

The couple, who on Friday will have their 76th wedding, say their vow to wed every day has brought them closer together.

Since their first wedding on January 5, the couple have held ceremonies with their family and friends, and been married at their home, in city squares, and surrounded by mist-covered hills.

Although they are not yet legally wed - something they have planned for later this year - the couple say their plan has made them fully appreciate and love one another more.

'It's an opportunity to show [Rachael] how important [she is] to me, and how romantic can I be ... for that, one day is never enough,' Hess said in a video on their website, as the couple tried to explain why they are having 365 weddings.

Albers, who met Hess whole salsa dancing in San Cristóbal, where the couple live and work, said as they prepared for their traditional wedding she realized it didn't really reflect their values.

Admitting she was turning into a 'bridezilla', Albers said: I began to realize this wasn't an event that reflected us. It didn't in anyway feel like it was an entrance into our partnership.'

The couple decided to cancel their planned March 8 nuptials and instead used their wedding budget to hold smaller ceremonies that meant more to them.

Each ceremony is unique - from the vows, outfits, location and witnesses - but each wedding is a more personal reflection of their love, the couple say.

Through their website, Albers and Hess have encouraged people to suggest places for them to marry.

This has led to some original weddings, including the one for their 74th ceremony, which was officated live on Huffington Post by Caitlyn Becker.

By getting married every day, the couple have a constant stream of firsts - from the first reception on day 3, and the first family ceremony on day 15, to 365 first kisses.

While they sometimes involve guests and witnesses, other times the ceremony is more simple with just the couple exchanging vows and rings.

And, although they don't always look like a traditional bride and groom, Albers says she has saved a special dress for the 365th wedding day.
