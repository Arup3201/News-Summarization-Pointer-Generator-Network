Airline food is notoriously bad, with most passengers forcing it down because at 30,000 feet, there are simply no other culinary options.

So the idea that some would actually want to consume it at ground level - where a huge variety of delicious, fresh, non-mystery meat options are available - is a surprising one.

Nevertheless, German food delivery website Allyouneed.com has launched Air Food One in collaboration with Lufthansa Airlines' caterers, delivering an aeroplane meal once a week to customers.

Airplane food on the ground: A new German delivery service provides meals from the plane in your home

A class above: Unlike the unidentifiable dishes in economy though, the meals are the same as those offered to Business Class passengers

But far from the unidentifiable meats, bland sauces and soggy vegetables the average economy flyer is begrudgingly accustomed too, the meals are actually from Business Class. 

Just like on the plane, you can choose from the regular or vegetarian option. 

Every Wednesday, customers will receive delivery of the same meal being served to passengers sitting up front on Lufthansa that week. 

Familiar:  This is the sort of meal the average flyer is usually faced with on flights

Options: Customers are given a choice of regular or vegetarian options

The full meal costs €9.99 (approximately £7.85) per week and €8.99 (approximately £7.05) for vegetarian. 

The food arrives cold and needs to be cooked in the oven before consuming. It is also suitable for freezing.

On the menu next week is 'Chinese Shin of Beef', and 'Shak Navratan Indian Vegetables' for the vegetarian options. 

Cutting down on waste: Catering company LSG Sky Chefs reduces waste by using the surplus Business Class meals not ordered by passengers on board

Other upcoming dishes include 'Emperor Bream with Herb Risotto' or 'Panserotti with Ricotta', and 'Chicken Breast with Pepper' or 'Pumpkin Gnocchi with Ragout'.

The service is much like any other ready meal delivery, except only one meal per week is currently available.

The idea also cuts down on food waste for LSG Sky Chefs, the catering company behind the service, as the surplus meals not ordered by Business Class passengers are used to fill orders, rather than being thrown out.
