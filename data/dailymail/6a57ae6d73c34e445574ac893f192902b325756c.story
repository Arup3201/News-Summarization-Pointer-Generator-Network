John McCririck is everywhere I look. His wobbly features leer from several dozen framed photographs and press clippings that smother the walls of his teeny mews house in London’s Primrose Hill.

There’s him with Maggie Thatcher, him smoking an enormous cigar and him next to an even more enormous pair of fake breasts. Most terrifying of all, though, is an oversize papier mâché effigy of the former Channel 4 pundit, complete with trademark deerstalker hat, gleaming white teeth and flailing tongue.

There’s just one photograph of long-suffering wife Jenny, partly hidden behind a rubber plant.

Support: Jenny McCririck, wife of the former Channel 4 horse-racing pundit John, thinks claims her husband is sexist are 'stupid'

He has never been very nice about her and famously calls her ‘Booby’, because like the South American bird, he claims she’s ‘stupid, squawks a lot and was easy to catch’.

But the women who emerges from an upstairs bedroom is surprisingly attractive; glamorous even. She has a lovely figure, an enviable pair of pins and looks much younger than her 68 years.

How on earth this seemingly sane woman has managed 42 long years with racing’s favourite bigot is anyone’s guess. Yet not only does she defend the apparently indefensible, she does so with a matter-of-fact directness that makes the true situation all-too-clear: she is an integral part of team McCririck and its success for the past 30 years – the straight man to her husband’s comic turn.

Case: John McCririck , pictured outside the Central Employment Tribunal, in central London, believes the channel and TV production company IMG Media Limited sacked him because of his age

‘Oh, all that sexism stuff is absolutely stupid,’ Jenny says, in a thick Yorkshire twang. ‘People ask how I could be married to him, but John’s not like that in real life. It’s a façade. He’s actually very generous, kind and extremely hard-working. Ask any of his friends, they’ll tell you.’

The bosses of Channel 4, however, have taken a different view. Indeed, the 73-year-old’s well-established ‘routine’ was last week cited as the reason he was axed from the channel’s racing team last year. During an employment tribunal, which ended last Monday, the pundit’s former TV bosses rubbished his claim that he was ‘culled’ because of his age and said that his ‘irritating comedy act’ was over-dramatic, and liable to offend. Viewers wanted serious journalists and a more up-market programme.

Channel 4’s claim has incensed Jenny, who has been driven to speak for the first time since the controversy began. ‘I don’t know what they’re going on about,’ she says, angrily. ‘He was encouraged to behave outrageously on Celebrity Big Brother and Wife Swap.

‘He also did the Million Pound Drop and was supposed to do Come Dine With Me. But it was Channel 4 who kept asking him to do these things for them. If they hated his act so much, why did they want him?

‘It never stopped him from being a serious journalist. He’s won press awards and has written for newspapers for years.’

Jenny adds: ‘Look, I know John’s getting older, but you can still work when you’re 73. Look at Bruce Forsyth [who’s 85] and Jeremy Paxman [63] They’re not young, but they can still do the job.’

It was a phone call last October that saw the end of the McCriricks’ world as they knew it. John had been in Las Vegas on a solo holiday when he was told by Channel 4’s commissioning editor for sport, Jamie Aitchison, that his contract was not being renewed after nearly three decades in the job.

‘Rumours were circulating that the older people would be axed and younger ones brought in,’ Jenny says. ‘John couldn’t believe it. He had been the face of Channel 4 Racing for so long.

Facade: Mr McCririck's wife Jenny has supported in through the tribunal and says her husband is 'actually very generous, kind and extremely hard-working

‘They told him just half an hour before they put out a press release,’ she adds, getting teary. ‘He was terribly, terribly upset and couldn’t believe they could do that to him after so many years. It was pure cruelty on their part.

‘People might say it was just a job, but to us, it was our whole lives. We worked so hard together. I used to get up at 4am to get the papers from King’s Cross so John could do a paper review. We built our life around it and Channel 4 has destroyed that life.’

Jenny admits the stress has made them both ill. Earlier this year John was rushed to hospital after collapsing at Cheltenham, while she has had chest pains.

Since his sacking, John’s regular work has amounted to a twice-monthly stint on Sunday Forum, a chat show on the At The Races  channel, and he was seen last week on the Channel 5 show Celebrity  Wedding Planner, arranging a  couple’s wedding with Dead or Alive singer Pete Burns.

It seems his well-established reputation as a sexist is perhaps too far ingrained on potential employers’ minds. He got into hot water for calling Channel 4 Racing sidekick Tanya Stevenson ‘The Female’ and was scolded by former Channel 4 Racing presenter Lesley Graham for trying to nickname her ‘Crackling’. During Celebrity Big Brother he called fellow housemate Caprice ‘The Totty’.

Despite this, Jenny is quick to defend her man.

Experience: The 73-year-old has been a broadcast journalist for 35 years, working for BBC, ITV and Channel 4

‘If you say somebody is a slag or something, well that’s horrible. But John’s names were all nice,’ she says, adding that he would not use the names if the women objected.

She is so fond of her own moniker  that it appears on her business card. ‘I really don’t get offended by Booby and don’t find it objectionable,’ Jenny says. ‘To me, it’s more a term of endearment.’

Jenny first met John at a party in 1970. He has claimed he was first attracted to her yellow Labrador, Simon, but took her on because she was attached to the end of his lead.

If makes you wonder what exactly attracted Jenny to John.

‘Some people like boring people who go through life with no opinions and don’t antagonise people. Well, I don’t like boring people. Say what you like about John, but he was never boring. My parents didn’t like him at all. But look, I am happy! If I wasn’t, I would leave him.’

And what of John’s claims to have been something of a sexual athlete in the past? ‘Ridiculous!’ Jenny shrieks, making the sleeping cat jump. ‘It’s a joke! Anyway sex is not something I’m going to discuss. I know John would, but he’s just being silly. He said that to be outrageous.’

Earlier this year Jenny showed her steelier side when she told John off for discussing his penchant for big breasts with a female interviewer.

‘John thought it was a joke, but I didn’t,’ she says with a sniff. ‘He said what does it matter, but it does matter because that’s not the truth, he’s putting on an act. I was worried he wouldn’t be taken seriously during the tribunal as a result.’

The couple now face an agonising wait for the panel to reach its decision, which could take weeks. John is suing for £500,000 in lost earnings and £2.5million in damages.

‘I’m furious about the tribunal because it has become so expensive,’ says Jenny. ‘But we’re lucky, we own two houses in Primrose Hill [one of London’s most expensive residential areas – she admits the homes are worth several million] and don’t have any children to pay for. If we lose we won’t face ruin, but at the same time I don’t have that sort of money sitting in a bank.

‘That said, I wasn’t wary about doing the tribunal at all. John felt the only way he could move forward was to do this. I have to respect him for that. He has been treated appallingly. We’re talking about Channel 4. They’re supposed to hold a flag for integrity, diversity and fairness.

‘If we lose we’ll carry on in the knowledge that John did the best he could. If we win, we’ll do the same, but no amount of money can ever make up for what Channel 4 has done. John will never get over  it. Neither will I.’
