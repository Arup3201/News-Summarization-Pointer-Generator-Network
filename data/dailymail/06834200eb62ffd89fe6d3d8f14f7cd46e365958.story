Last season, to many women’s despair, pink seemed to be the only colour for coats. Don’t all groan at once, then, when we tell you this spring’s must-have shade is even trickier: yellow.

Thanks to early outbreaks of sunshine, High Street shops are struggling to keep up with demand for cover-ups in shades from mustard to lemon, despite the fact that the wrong shade can make any skin tone look wan.  But pick the right pigment for you and there can be nothing more flattering. 

Fashion editor ELIZA SCARBOROUGH shows you how to choose the right hue . . .

Highlight your golden undertones with a rich, sunny yellow, which will lift your complexion without jarring. Teamed with orange and terracotta, it will pack quite a punch. If you’re not feeling so bold, match your coat with understated khaki and caramel.

This complexion should stick to powder yellow, teamed with cream or 
pastel shades. Vibrant, lemon yellow will only bring out sallow 
undertones, while golden skin and hair will glow when set against more 
muted tones.

Choose
 gentle vanilla or golden hues, which won’t overpower or wash out skin 
like stronger yellows and work well against dark hair. A block colour 
coat could look too severe, so try a jacquard print like this with 
contrasting edging. A pop of intense lemon accessories is all the 
boldness you need.

A rich canary yellow will contrast with darker skin tones perfectly, while anything too muted or pastel will look insipid.

Try
 mixing a vibrant yellow with bold cobalt blue or another strong primary
 colour for added impact. Keep the rest of your outfit simple and let 
the colours do the talking.

Redheads and those with pale complexions are rightly wary of bright yellow. Instead, try mustard teamed with jewel colours to make a statement.

Shades of primrose and daffodil will also work well for a more subtle look. Steer clear of canary yellow, taupe, tan and cream, which will wash you out or clash horribly with red hair.
