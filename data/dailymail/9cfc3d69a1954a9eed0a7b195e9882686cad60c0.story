Iraqi troops are losing control of one of the country's major oil refineries to the Islamic terrorist group ISIS, according to a U.S. official today.

The estimated 270 soldiers on the Baiji refinery are outnumbered and trapped as the battle raged on for a fourth day with up to 500 ISIS militants.

The terrorists plan to keep the soldiers isolated until the run out of food and ammunition, a U..S. source said.

Smoke rises from the the Baiji oil refinery in Iraq on Thursday. Workers were evacuated as it remained unclear who was actually in control of the plant - although witnesses said ISIS flags were reportedly hanging on the complex. The refinery accounts for almost a third of the country's refining capacity

The source told ABC
 that the government soldiers are trapped and they are running out of 
supplies. The military is unable to send in back up as the road to Baiji
 is controlled by ISIS. 

He said: 'There is very little the Iraqi government can do to save or liberate those guys.'

'The militants have managed to break 
in to the refinery. Now they are in control of the production units, 
administration building and four watch towers. 'This
 is 75 per cent of the refinery,' said an Iraqi official on Wednesday, 
speaking from inside the refinery which is located 130 miles north of 
Baghdad.

Any lengthy outage at Baiji risks long lines at the gas pump and electricity shortages, adding to the chaos already facing Iraq.

The impending fall of the oil refinery 
to insurgents comes as a catastrophic loss for the Iraqi government a 
day after President Obama announced that 300 military advisers for the 
Special Forces are being sent to assist the besieged country.

They would join up to 275 being positioned in and around Iraq to provide security and support for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other American interests.

But he was adamant that U.S. troops would not be returning to combat.

Despite the deteriorating conditions, Obama has held off approving airstrikes sought by the Iraqi government.

The
 president said he could still approve 'targeted and precise' strikes if
 the situation on the ground required it, noting that the U.S. had 
stepped up intelligence gathering in Iraq to help identify potential 
targets.

Both sides claimed that they were winning the battle for the refinery but ISIS flags have been spotted hanging at the site. Black smoke is also billowing from the complex. 

Soldiers on the ground are being assisted with airstrikes by military helicopters but ISIS militants are holding strong.

Over the past week or so, ISIS militants have also taken over the cities of Mosul and Tikrit as they sweep through the country towards the capital.

The Baiji oil refinery in Iraq is one of the country's largest providers and is believed to be in the grips of ISIS militants
