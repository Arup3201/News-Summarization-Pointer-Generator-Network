Martin Demichelis believes he should be given more respect at Manchester City.

The Argentine was signed for Â£2.5million in the summer from Atletico Madrid, reuniting with former Malaga boss Manuel Pellegrini.

But a number of high-profile blunders in crucial games has lead to criticism and jokes at his expense.

Not fair: Martin Demichelis says he deserves more respect at Manchester City

Nearly there: The defender could end a mixed year with a Premier League trophy

And the 34-year-old admits he has never experienced the problem anywhere else in his length career.

'The people who criticised me need to be more respectful of me and what I've done during my career,' Demichelis told the Sunday Mirror.

'I have never experienced this before. I am a well-respected player who won titles in Argentina and Germany and I have never had these problems anywhere else.

'I am a foreign player here and I need to go with that.'

Demichelis also stressed he was thankful to Pellegrini for helping him through his first season in England.

Despite his critics, he could finish the season in style by lifting the Premier League title on Sunday if City get a point against West ham at the Etihad Stadium.

Low point: Demichelis was sent off against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 this season
