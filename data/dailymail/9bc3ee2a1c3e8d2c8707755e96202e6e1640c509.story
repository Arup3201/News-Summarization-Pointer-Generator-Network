Brussels was today accused of behaving like Oliver Twist after demanding even more mobey from the British taxpayer.

There was fury from ministers as the European Commission asked the UK to find an extra £1.4billion  to cover a shortfall in this year’s budget.

All member states are being asked to stump up a total of £9billion to cover overspending on regional development projects.

Begging bowl: British politicians condemned the European Commission for demanding more from taxpayers, likening the move to the plea in Oliver Twist for more food

A £415million chunk relates to projects run by the EU’s foreign service headed by Baroness Ashton, whose members have already come under fire for their lavish spending on chartered planes and diplomatic residences.

The budget shortfall costs more than the controversial £8.5bn Cyprus bailout. But it cannot be vetoed and only needs to be passed by a simple majority of the 27 member states.

It has been demanded by disgruntled EU officials who have only reluctantly accepted hard-won cuts to the European from 2014 to 2020 negotiated by David Cameron last month in a marathon session.

They made it clear they would veto the deal if unpaid bills for 2012 and 2013 - equivalent to around £77 per British household – are not paid this year before the budget cut comes in.

In a terse statement yesterday, the EU’s commissioner for Financial Planning and Budgets, Janusz Lewandowski said members ‘should not be surprised’ at having to pay these extra costs.

And he accused members – led by David Cameron - who say the EU should embrace austerity of acting like ‘ostriches’ by burying their heads in the sand as the bills for such projects mounted up.

Mr Lewandowski said: ‘This is creating a snowballing effect of unpaid claims transferred onto the following year. The ostrich policy can only work for so long: postponing payment of a bill will not make it go away.

‘Not one cent of the extra amount we request today is for the EU institutions, it will merely allow the EU to pay its share of projects that member states agreed to start in the past.’

Greg Clark, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This is a totally unacceptable request from the Commission at a time when most EU member states are taking difficult decisions to reduce public spending.

‘It is extraordinary that the Commission should demand an increase in the EU budget that is bigger than the rescue package that was agreed for Cyprus earlier this week.’

MEP George Lyon, who leads the
Lib Dem group in the EU parliament and sits on its budget committee, 
said the EU was behaving like ‘the Oliver Twist of international 
organisations’ – always asking for more, when it would not be clear 
until the autumn what the final bills will be.

He said: ‘It is hard to understand how
the Commission can justify this increase in the EU budget, long before 
bills from member states are even through the door.

‘At a tough time for ordinary families
and citizens across Europe, EU spending cannot be out of touch with the
problems of the real world and people deserve some more answers.’

Among the schemes which receive this funding are adult education and language exchanges for university students, development and environmental projects in rural areas, and improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.

The think tank Open Europe say the way this money is distributed is seriously flawed because if a rich region or country carries out an infrastructure project they must claim the money from EU, which has already been footed by their taxpayers, creating unnecessary bureaucracy.

The EU has accused leaders like David Cameron of behaving like 'ostriches' by burying their heads in the sand on the need for more money

They say reforming it so only poorer nations can access infrastructure funding, while richer nations save money by funding their own, would save Britain £4billion over seven years.

A spokesman said: ‘The Commission and MEPs’ demands for extra cash are unreasonable given the squeeze on national budgets and present a direct challenge to the UK and other national governments’ decision to cut the EU’s long term budget from 2014 onwards.

‘The EU needs to accept that circumstances have changed and that any outstanding projects should be funded from cuts elsewhere in the budget, for which there is ample scope.’

The EU say the estimates for these projects have gone up and they are under contract to foot the bill to avoid legal action or fines.

Members pay a share of the budget according to their economic strength – so if the budget amendment is passed Germany foots the largest bill followed by France then Britain.
