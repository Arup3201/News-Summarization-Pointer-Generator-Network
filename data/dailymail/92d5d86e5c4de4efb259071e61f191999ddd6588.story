Steven Taylor’s contribution to Newcastle’s winless start to the Premier League season amounted to little more than 60 seconds.

Seven games without victory, United were adrift in the relegation places with their long-serving defender having warmed the bench for the majority.

Now, on the back of maximum returns against Leicester and Spurs, the Magpies are up to 14th and manager Alan Pardew’s job is safe.

Steven Taylor has played for Newcastle United for the last eleven years - since he was 16 years old

The former England Under 21 captain has found first team appearances hard to come by of late

Taylor has played every minute of those victories but was only recalled in the wake of an injury to Mike Williamson.

The starting XI, however, is where the 28-year-old intends to stay and, when asked if he now deserved his place in the side, Taylor shot back: ‘Absolutely. The one thing I’ve done is waited for my chance and kept myself in good shape.

‘I’ve taken my chance and that’s what I had to do – we’ve got three points in both games.

‘One hundred per cent (I intend to stay in the side). I love my football and there’s nothing better than playing in front of 52,000 fans, that’s where I want to be.’

Since an injury to Mike Williamson though, Taylor has rejoined the Newcastle back-line for two wins in a row

Taylor, the former England Under-21 captain, was sent off on the opening day of last season following a reckless elbow on Sergio Aguero during a 4-0 defeat at Manchester City.

Pardew lost faith in the centre-back following that dismissal and he appeared just nine times in the league during the remainder of the campaign.

And, ahead of tomorrow’s return to the Etihad Stadium, Taylor reflected: ‘It’s horrible (being out of the team). You’ve just got to knuckle down and work hard and make sure you take that chance when it comes. Now, I’m feeling full of confidence.

‘But the rest of the lads have been fantastic and it’s been a real team effort these past two games.’

Taylor prefers not to talk about his red card but believes United travel to City for their Capital One Cup fourth-round tie in good spirits.

‘If you win games you are confident,’ he said, Sammy Ameobi and Ayoze Perez having got the second-half goals during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Spurs.

‘We have that belief to stay in a game even when we are not playing well.

‘We did not play that well in the first half (at Spurs) even though we created a few chances.

‘But we had no fear - you cannot playing with fear when you go to White Hart Lane.

Taylor's first game back after Mike Williamson's injury coincided with Newcastle's first win of the season

‘I thought we were fantastic in the second half. We really stuck at it. They had one shot maybe. When you come to Tottenham that doesn’t ever happen.

‘In the second half only one team was in it. We have creativity in the side and Sammy Ameobi was a breath of fresh air for us. He showed that.

‘And it was great for Ayoze Perez to get his goal. He is a goalscorer, put the ball in front of him and he has that ability.

‘We are now looking forward to City. It will be tough game, we know that, but we will cause them problems.’
