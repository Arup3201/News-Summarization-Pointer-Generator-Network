Residents of a Milton Keynes care home have created movie magic by posing for uncannily realistic remakes of iconic film posters.

From Dirty Dancing and Breakfast At Tiffany's and Reservoir Dogs, the residents of the ExtraCare Charitable Trust's Shenley Wood Retirement Villiage have produced their own 2015 calendar, based on famous films.

And aged from 64 to 93, they also recreated scenes from Harry Potter, The Wizard of Oz and Singin' In The Rain.

Residents of The ExtraCare Charitable Trust's Shenley Wood Retirement Villiage in Milton Keynes created a calendar of their favourite movie posters including this pose from Dirty Dancing

The residents of the care home who are aged 64 to 93 are said to have had a great time making the calendar 

Resident Peter Mercer, 82, said: 'The dressing up was such fun. Lauren, our photographer and the staff were marvelous.

'We never thought the interest in the idea would reach these dizzy heights. It was a labour of love for the Village and our wonderful community here.'

Village Activities Facilitator Lauren McMillan, who acted as photographer for the project, said: 'The photoshoot day was great fun with people running around dressed as Harry Potter, The Tin Man and Gangsters.' 

For The Golden Age of Cinema calendar, residents dressed up in characters' outfits, wearing a range of wigs to bring the film posters back to life.

The ExtraCare Charitable Trust, which runs Shenley Wood Retirement Village, enables older people to enjoy a healthier, active and more independent lifestyle.

The charity, which runs 14 retirement villages and 17 smaller housing developments in the Midlands and the North, describes itself as offering a modern alternative to traditional care or nursing home.  

Charity bosses also say they offer a wide range of social opportunities. 

Past fundraising activities include residents hiking the North Bucks Way and events include a murder mystery night.
