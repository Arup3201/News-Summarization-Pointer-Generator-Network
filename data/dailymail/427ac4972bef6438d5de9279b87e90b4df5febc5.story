A Russian army convoy with 32 tanks has crossed into Ukraine despite the Kremlin vowing to keep a fragile truce, Ukraine's military claimed today.

Kiev's army spokesman Andriy Lysenko said the fleet included the tanks, 16 howitzer artillery systems and 30 trucks containing ammunition and fighters.

If true it is the latest blow to a truce between pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine's military which has already been broken several times.

Mr Lysenko told a televised briefing the incursion happened yesterday, adding: 'The deployment continues of military equipment and Russian mercenaries to the front lines.

'Supplies of military equipment and enemy fighters from the Russian Federation are continuing'.

He added five Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 16 wounded in the past 24 hours despite the ceasefire.

Ukraine and the West have continuously accused Moscow of fuelling a pro-Russian rebellion in the east with troops and weapons, which Russia has denied.

Russia's Defence Ministry had no immediate comment on Mr Lysenko's statement but earlier it again rejected Western allegations that Moscow was deploying more troops near the border.

Pro-Russian rebels also accused Ukraine's military of launching a new offensive yesterday - a claim which was immediately denied by leaders in the capital Kiev. 

Sporadic violence has continued since September 5, when a truce was signed in the conflict that has already cost more than 4,000 lives.

Tensions were heightened after rebel leaders held elections in their self-proclaimed 'people's republics' on Sunday in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.

In the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, leaders have claimed they can be independent of Ukraine's energy supplies as the nation faces an increasing risk of having gas from Russia cut off.

Earlier today Russian leaders said they were still committed to the fragile ceasefire.

Foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Kremlin wanted further talks to build on peace moves, according to an adviser.

He also said Russia respected the will of voters after the election in Donetsk - which was regarded as illegitimate by the West.

But after Western criticism, he added he had deliberately chosen the word 'respect' rather than 'recognise'.
