The number of malnutrition cases in England has soared in the past five tears as poorer families struggle to afford food in the recession.

The amount of malnutrition admissions to NHS hospitals has seen a significant spike, with last year 5,499 cases being recorded.

Admissions were almost double compared to the figure in 2008, when just 3,161 people were treated in English hospitals for malnutrition.

More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger

The shocking rise has been blamed on the economic downturn, with Jim Cunningham, Labour MP for Coventry South, who claimed the revealed a 'map of how the economic situation of the past five years has affected people', The Independent reported.

Mr Cunningham acquired the figures, which were released by health minister Norman Lamb, in a written answer to a parliamentary question.

The figures were obtained from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and were collected by primary care trusts, the Manchester Evening News reported.

Figures from the Health and Social 
Care Information Centre show that the number of cases of rickets - a 
disease of poverty associated with vitamin D deficiency - have also 
dramatically risen, from 561 in 2008/09 to 702 in the past year.

More
 than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to 
stave off hunger, according to charities speaking in September.

Damning figures come after a review has been promised into hospital food, following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times

Easington MP Grahame Morris, who sits 
on the House of Commons health select committee, told the Chronicle that
 the figures should be an alarm bell.

He
 said: 'I certainly think the Government’s policies on austerity with 
cuts in public services and welfare benefits have been a contributory 
factor.

'I suspect, 
with increasing fuel bills, many low-income households in the North 
East, especially older people, are having to choose between heating and 
eating.'

Malnutrition is a common health problem, with about 3 million people estimated to be malnourished in the UK at any time.

Around a third of people admitted to hospital or care homes in the UK are found to be malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.

Malnutrition is caused by either an inadequate diet or a problem absorbing nutrients from food.

There are a variety of factors that cause it, including having reduced mobility, a long-term health condition or a low income.

Symptoms of malnutrition include weak muscles, feeling constantly tired, low mood and an increase in illnesses or infections .

A doctor should be consulted if your body mass index (BMI) is lower than 18.5 or you experience the symptoms listed above. 

The main treatment for people diagnosed with malnutrition is dietary changes.

Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help.

Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet.

The figures come as the Archbishop of Canterbury has urged Christmas shoppers to give money to Britain’s expanding network of food banks rather than splash out on expensive presents.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby made the appeal in reaction to news of a shocking increase in the number of impoverished Britons now relying on food handouts.

With the number of those receiving basic supplies trebling over the past year to 350,000, he said it would be ‘wonderful’ if people gave a tenth of their festive shopping budget to their local food bank this Christmas.

The Archbishop also warned cash-strapped shoppers to beware of overspending and plunging themselves into debt.

He said: ‘I am not a Scrooge. But what I would say to people is, be sane about it.

‘Don’t overstretch yourself and end up with an enormous debt hangover.’

The damning figures come after a review has been promised into hospital food, following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times.

Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed.

Without the necessary assistance, they risk malnutrition and dehydration, say charities. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30million uneaten meals are thrown away annually.

It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry.

The Government and Age UK have now vowed to carry out a major review of hospital food, with national standards issued by next summer.

Relatives have told how previously sprightly patients have become emaciated and lifeless on wards because they are either too frail to eat or just cannot face the meals.

Those with dementia, arthritis or poor sight are often left grappling with tricky wrapping and difficult to open sandwich packets or simply struggling to hold paper cups.
