One US restaurant is planning to put on the spread to end all spreads for Thanksgiving this Thursday.

Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York's Meatpacking district is hosting a $35,000 (£22,300) feast for four - that's $8,750 (£5,500) a head - making it the most expensive Thanksgiving feast of all time.

What's more unbelievable, one group of four has already bought it (although its not yet been revealed who).

Game bird: The meal includes turkey stuffed with seven pounds of ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon

And it's not just a meal, but the ultimate American Thanksgiving experience that's up for grabs.

Tourists with deep pockets will also be treated to four grandstand seats at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; a $6,000 (£3,800) gift card to Bloomingdale's; and dancing lessons at Fred Astaire dance studios to learn the Turkey Trot, a popular dance from the early twentieth century. 

The food itself with include a nine-course meal with squab (young pigeon) stuffed with foie gras and soaked in Courvoisier L'Esprit Cognac ($5,000/£3200 a bottle) followed by roasted organic turkey stuffed with  seven pounds of  ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon and gravy made with Château Mouton Rothschild ($1,750(£1,100)/bottle), widely regarded as one of the word's finest clarets. 

Finest dining: New York Old Homestead Steakhouse promises a dinner 'with attitude and personality'

A serving of butternut squash will be infused with winter black truffles ($160£100/lb) and whipped sweet potatoes are topped with three pounds of Royal Osetra 000 caviar ($1,600£1,020/oz).

The creamy mash potato is accompanied by Swedish moose cheese and the cranberry orange relish is made with Gran Marnier.

To finish diners will get poached bourbon-soaked pears with pumpkin paste dusted with 24-carat gold flakes.

Far from a dry lunch, the drinks menu is unsurprisingly lavish with fine wine, champagne and Scotch.

No expense spared: A bowl of the potato mash with Swedish moose cheese, made from moose milk

'Let's face it, Thanksgiving dinner is boring, basic, and frankly, unimaginative. We're taking all of the traditional holiday fare — the turkey, gravy, stuffing, pumpkin pie — to a creative level never seen before. It's turkey dinner with attitude and personality,' co-owner Marc Sherry told the New York Daily News. 

'We know it's over-the-top expensive, but Thanksgiving comes once a year. If you can splurge for this, you have a lot to be thankful for.'

For the less Amex-ready the restaurant also has a $65 (£40) Thanksgiving package that comes with turkey, stuffing and the rare opportunity to watch four people eat a $35,000 dinner. 

Thanksgiving is celebrated every forth Thursday in November and every second Monday in October in Canada.
