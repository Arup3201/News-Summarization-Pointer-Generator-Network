Before Real Madrid and San Lorenzo battle it out to be crowned Club World Cup champions in Marrakech on Saturday, the two losing semi-finalists will contest third-place.

Mexican side Cruz Azul, who were humbled 4-0 by Cristiano Ronaldo and Co in the last-four, face Auckland City for a podium finish after the New Zealand side were beaten 2-1 by San Lorenzo in extra-time.

Cruz Azul are aiming to become the third Mexican side to triumph in the competition's 'small final', after Monterrey in 2012 and Necaxa in 2000.
