A woman who won $1million off a scratch-off lottery ticket given to her in a birthday card from a friend plans to share her earnings with her friend's family. 

Theresa Dybalski, a retired insurance company from Lackawanna, New York, was celebrating at a birthday lunch when she received the ticket. 

Her friend who gave it to her, however, has died since Dybalski's birthday. So she plans to share her winnings with family members of her friend, who has not been named.

The ticket was given to her by a friend during a lunch celebrating Dybalski's birthday. The friend has since died, so Dybalski plans to share her winnings with the friend's family

'She was a kind, sweet, loving lady who would bend over backwards to help you out. Hopefully she's present here as I am receiving this great reward,' she said of her friend, according to AOL. 

It wasn't until she scratched off the last box in the last row that she realized that she saw her number matched and saw the word "Jackpot'. 

Dybalski received a lump-sum payment of $522,822 after taxes last month.

Other than sharing with her friend, she plans to address 'a couple of issues around the house', she told Buffalo News.
