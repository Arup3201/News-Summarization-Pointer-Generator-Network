Just what the world needs – another Wiener.

A New Mexico politician with a surname remarkably similar to shamed former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner is in hot water after a professional photographer snapped him with a group of scantily-clad young women.

Michael Wiener, who serves as the Republican Bernalillo County Commissioner, is now facing calls to resign after the provocative photograph.

Layover? Commissioner Michael Wiener of New Mexico, centre, claims he was posing with 'bar girls' in the Philippines at the photographer's request and was only in Angeles City because of a layover

The photo in question was taken by Seattle-based photographer John Keatley, who was in Angeles City in the Philippines to document the thriving sex tourism industry there.

History: Michael Wiener serves as the Republican Bernalillo County Commissioner in New Mexico

Wiener vehemently denied the claims, telling Albuquerque station KOB, which first broke the sensational story, that he was only in the red light district for a few hours while he waited for his next flight.

He said: ‘We went there to take a look… walk up Walking Street and then went to the airport.’

The commissioner said he was only touring the district with his fiancée during a layover. They were flying to see his daughter, the commissioner said.

The picture of him and the woman he identified as his fiancée may be viewed on Mr Keatley’s personal blog, along with other photos of Angeles City’s red-light district.

According to Mr Keatley, Wiener first identified the woman accompanying him as his girlfriend.

However, when KOB looked into his flight schedules, they could not find a flight schedule to Caticlan, where his daughter was.

In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Wiener would not say whether or not he knew he was wandering around the red-light district. He did say that he ‘just wanted to take a quick tour,’ comparing it to people wanting to see the casinos at Las Vegas, even if they didn’t gamble.

Mr Keatley, who works as a professional photographer who shoots portraits and advertising, told a different tale.

He told TPM's Muckraker blog ‘it was very obvious to me that (Wiener) was not respectful to women. He was there to have a good time.’

The photographer said that people travel the world over to visit the city’s booming red light district.He said that he heard Wiener making inappropriate jokes to the women – called ‘bar girls’ – suggesting that one of them touch his penis.

Wiener vehemently denied the claim. ‘I may have made a comment like don’t get too close to my girlfriends here, but I didn’t mention anything like that,’ Wiener told KOB.

The other Weiner: Former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) was forced to resign after a series of illicit photos were posted to his Twitter account; he is seen speaking in June of last year

Laid bare: Weiner denied claims that he sent a picture of his bulging underwear to a young woman, but confessed last June that was, in fact, him

He also issued a statement Thursday that read: ‘I’m a hard-working commissioner who has a right to take a vacation, to visit my fiancée and my daughter. I did absolutely nothing wrong-  I was a tourist on my own time – not there on county business (sic) my time is my time!’

In the statement, he rhetorically asked: ‘If I was doing something wrong – why would I pose for a picture?’

Now, Wiener is facing considerable heat to resign from his public office position. Michelle Lujan Grishman, who serves as a commissioner with the New Mexico State Bar, said the photos call for Wiener’s resignation.

She told KOB: ‘During most of his career at the county, there have been allegations of inappropriate behaviour that borders on racism, sexual harassment, hostile work environments, and these pictures seem to condemn human trafficking and then exploitation of women.’

Last year, Wiener was cleared in an investigation after a female staffer complained that he made off-colour, sexually explicit comments to her, saying: ‘Did you know that the (County Commission) now has a Wiener and a Johnson on it?’

Though he admitted that he made the statement, Wiener said it was intended to be taken as a joke.The Albuquerque Journal noted another gaffe, where he referred to a Santa Fe man as ‘VERY Hispanic and NOT very sophisticated – very very BLUE Collar.’

During their encounter in the red-light district, Mr Keatley was unaware that Wiener was a politician, and had no idea who he was until Wiener handed him his email address and requested that Mr Keatley send him the photos.

Wiener is up for re-election this year.
