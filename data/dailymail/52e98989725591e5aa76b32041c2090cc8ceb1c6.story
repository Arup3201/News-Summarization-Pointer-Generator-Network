Cockroach companion: Kyle Kandilian, a 20-year-old student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, raises some 200,000 cockroaches at his parent's home

If you thought you summer cockroach infestation was bad, you'll never believe how many creepy-crawlers Kyle Kandilian deals with.

The 20-year-old Dearborn, Michigan native has about 200,000 cockroaches living in his house - on purpose!

Kandilian has been raising cockroaches for almost eight years, and even started a business selling some as food and the more exotic species as pets.

Money raised from his roach business goes to pay for college at the University of Michigan-Dearborn where he's studying for a career in either forestry, pest management or nature-insect education.

Kandilian first developed his passion for cockroachery when he visited the University of Detroit Mercy, he told the Detroit Free Press.

The university had a 10-gallon fish tank filled with Madagascar hissing cockroaches and Kandilian found them captivating.

He was allowed to hold one of the roaches and remarked on how docile they were.

When he got home he immediately asked his mom if he could get one.

'Kyle? You are never bringing cockroaches into this house,' she said.

'And the rest is history,' Kandilian laughs.

His parents eventually gave into his cockroach obsession, and a few pets turned into a thriving business: Roachcrossing.com.

Kandilian sells his roaches to reptile and amphibian owners for food for as little as a dime a dozen. The rarer species, like the macropanesthia rhinoceros which live up to 10 or 15 years, can go for $150 to $200.Â

And while he loves his roaches, living with 200,000 of them does present it's problems - especially for his parents.

One morning at about 4 or 5am, Kandilian was woken up by his mother who took him to the bathroom.

'Kyle, we need to stop this,' she said as she pointed to the hissing cockroach relaxing on the toilet paper roll.

But the problem of escaping cockroaches was solved when Kandilian did a high school project on bug barriers, designed to keep his pets from escaping.

For that project, Kandilian even won a scholarship.

While many people squirm at the sign of cockroaches, Kandilian seems perfectly comfortable handling them - letting them even walk on his shirt.

He says it's his life mission to change the stigmas associated with cockroaches.

'There are maybe a dozen cockroaches that are pests worldwide, out of the 4,000 species,' he said. 'And they give the rest a really bad rap.'

There's a lot that people don't know about the other, non-pest cockroaches: like the fact that some give birth just like humans.

'I've read books that there's a very intimate association between the cockroach egg inside certain female cockroaches,' he said, 'as there is to humans and human birth.'

After almost eight years raising roaches, he is still awed by all the variety in the species.

'The body shape in almost every roach is the same, but the way that Mother Nature has tinted and changed each individual species to look slightly different just is very enthralling to me,' he said.
