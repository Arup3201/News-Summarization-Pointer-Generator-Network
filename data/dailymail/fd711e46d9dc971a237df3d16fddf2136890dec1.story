A graduate who was on a work placement in California has been killed after getting on the back of a motorbike with an alleged drunk and speeding driver.

Rebecca Dempsey, 21, of Chelsfield in Kent was spending four months in Mammoth Lakes and was due home next week.

Rebecca, known to her family and friends as Becki, had been at a bar where she worked on Sunday evening when she decided to get on the bike with a man, who is believed to have been drunk.

After crashing, the emergency services were called but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

The male driver, 31, who has been named by a local newspaper as Edgar Lee Weaver Junior, has been arrested on charges of vehicular manslaughter and gross negligence.

A Mammoth Lakes Police Department report said the investigation into the crash 'indicates that excessive speed and alcohol were involved.'

Speaking at the family home near Orpington, Miss Dempsey's mother Karen told of her heartbreak at her daughter's death saying it had been difficult to get full details about what happened.

The 51-year-old said: 'We don't know the details. It seems like the whole community has closed down - nobody is talking to us.

'It's devastating and the fact he's survived doesn't seem to make sense. We understand he had been drinking and was speeding.

'I've been told there were no other vehicles involved.

'But we don't really know. Apparently people told her not to go, I don't think she knew the guy very well.'

Mrs Dempsey explained that her daughter 'may have been at a loose end' getting home so accepted the lift.

She added: 'Becki will be so missed - she didn't waste a day and crammed so much in and always had a smile on her face.

'We were really looking forward to her coming home.'

Miss Dempsey was on a four-month work placement after finishing her degree course in media with a 2.1 at Staffordshire University.

She had attended Coopers School in Chislehurst in Kent and dozens of her friends from school and university have flooded social media with tributes to her.
