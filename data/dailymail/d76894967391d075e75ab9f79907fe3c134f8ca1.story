Paul Lambert will look to trigger the £7.5million purchase of Tom Cleverley from Manchester United once the January window opens but admits Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner and the player himself must agree first.

Cleverley is on a season-long loan at Villa, who have a first option to buy, but could decide to wait until the summer when he is a free agent and assess his options. 

From a club perspective, Lambert said Lerner would need to be satisfied with the finances of paying cash up front to secure his signature.

The England midfielder has impressed at Villa Park and is getting regular games, only missing the clash against his parent club through ineligibility and suspension. 

'We’ve got the option to buy in January. I will definitely try. A lot will depend on finances,’ said Lambert. 

'We’ve had one or two discussions with (chief executive) Tom Fox and Randy. If something comes up and he thinks it’s right for the club and affordable, I’m pretty sure he will look at it.

'I will have a discussion with Tom. I’ve never really had that with him. He’s still a Manchester United player. I’ve got him for a season anyway.’

Lambert said Cleverley was blossoming by featuring on a consistent basis after losing his place in United’s midfield. 

‘Tom's been great around the place. Sometimes loan players are not like that,’ he added. 'I’m pretty sure he loves his football here. I think he’s played really well.

‘He’s only 25, he’s got years ahead of him I’m pretty sure he won’t want to sit around. Knowing Tom Cleverley the way I do now, I’m sure he’s not one of the lads who wants to keep sitting on a bench.'
