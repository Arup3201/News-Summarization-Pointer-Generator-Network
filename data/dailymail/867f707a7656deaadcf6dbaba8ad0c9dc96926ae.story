An obese woman who struggled to climb the stairs at 29 stone has lost more than half her body weight - to abseil 330ft down a British landmark.

Kim Freshwater, 44, celebrated slimming from a huge size 38 to a slender 12 by completing the dare-devil stunt at Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower.

The abseil brought an end to a 30 year battle with her weight.

Mrs Freshwater, a mother-of-three, wore size 16 clothes while she was still a primary school pupil at the age of 11.

After Kim's father passed away while she was a teenager she put on more and more weight as she turned to food for comfort.

This contributed to high blood pressure, breathing problems and severe back pain.

She ended up needing to walk with a stick as an adult, unable to stand to cook, iron or do the washing up and even climbing stairs on all fours for ease.

Kim finally resolved to lose weight when her huge size prevented her attending her uncle's funeral.

She was unable to walk from the church to the graveside due to her large large size and lack of fitness.

Mrs Freshwater, from Havant, Hants, sought the help of her doctor who prescribed her 12 weeks of vouchers for a slimming club.

It changed her life and two years on Kim has lost 16st - more than half her body weight.

She said: 'After my uncle's funeral, I felt I'd let my family down because I wasn't there to support them and I was so upset I couldn't sleep.

'I went downstairs to watch television and there was a programme on about obese funerals.

'It showed how obese people need special coffins and how difficult it is to cremate their bodies.

'It was as if someone was trying to tell me something. I didn't ever want to put my family through that.'

She added: 'When my dad died my eating became out of control.

'He'd always been my best friend and I suppose I used food to fill the hole he left.

'As I got older, people would always say how pretty I'd be if I lost weight and I did try, but the diets I did were only ever quick fixes - I'd regain all the weight I lost as soon as I stopped.'

It was a hard job, but with the support of husband Lee, 53, and children Emma, 17, Daniel, 16, and Matthew, 14, Kim changed her eating habits from one large meal a day to three healthy homemade meals. In the first 12 weeks she lost 3st 2lb.

With her new-found confidence and 
fitness Kim abseiled down the side of the Tower, with her family and 
slimming club friends cheering her on.

She now plays tennis, swims, and walks miles indulging her hobby of photography.

She has even started cycling again after last hanging up her helmet 20 years ago.

Kim said: 'It's remarkable how much more I can do since losing weight.

'I feel like I've got my life back. I used to walk with my head down and try to blend into the background. Now I'm living life to the full.

'I'm taking part in days out and activities with my family instead of watching them have fun without me and there's so much I want to do.

'I feel like the world is my oyster now and I am going to grab every opportunity with both hands.

She added: 'I love that I don't need 
seat belt extensions on planes anymore, I can sit in chairs with arms, 
and I can shop on the High Street.'

'To be able to abseil down the side of the Spinnaker Tower when I previously struggled to walk down the stairs is a huge achievement. It was a great experience.'
