Sam Allardyce was positively brimming with bouquets. He praised his resolute defenders, he celebrated his strikers, he paid particular tribute to the brilliance of Alex Song, West Ham’s most influential contributor. But, in the wake of a genuinely momentous victory, he could not refrain from stealing a modest moment at centre stage.

The cue was a suggestion that he might feel vindicated by the recent performances of his team, following the critical bruisings he had suffered last season. He started to mutter about the dangers of looking back, of dwelling on the past. Then he burst out: ‘It’s well documented: I’m still here!’

In fairness, only the meanest curmudgeon would deny the manager his satisfaction. If West Ham had found an available replacement, then Allardyce would surely have been on his way last spring.

Ratings by SAM CUNNINGHAM at Upton Park 

This morning, as his team reflect on their third win in succession and look down on all but a handful of the Premier League, his job seems blissfully secure.

Allardyce spoke of ‘a terrific performance’ and ‘a massive, massive victory’. Indeed it was. As a consequence of a full-hearted, soundly-organised effort, the title ambitions of Chelsea have moved into sharper focus. As a further consequence, the continued tenure of City’s Manuel Pellegrini is coming into question.

The Chilean denied feeling under any pressure, but since he also asserted that his team had deserved to win this absorbing match, his judgment may not be entirely reliable. For City are currently playing like strangers to their real form.

A side which once reeked of class, now reeks of something like passive complacency, a malady best demonstrated by the man who was once their most devastating player. Until the team finally found itself, deep in the second half, Yaya Toure had performed like a weary irrelevance. His impact was minimal, his contribution belying the talent which had once made him one of the English game’s most illustrious imports.

Just as Song toiled and sweated for the midfield control he enjoyed, so Toure seemed reluctant to join the battle. With Sergio Aguero untypically missing chances galore, with Eliaquim Mangala suffering a merciless chasing from West Ham’s front men, and with Vincent Kompany not only equally ineffective but hugely fortunate to remain on the field after a string of frustrated lunges, the wonder was that City remained in the argument for so long.

Goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho had carried West Ham clear and, despite a fine retaliation from the admirable David Silva late on, City never did enough to state a plausible case. They were left to curse a number of squandered opportunities, but they had done little to deserve equality. Their rally had arrived too late and carried too little conviction. They began with a degree of optimism. Aguero, running from half way, battered a drive which caught a deflection and saw Adrian scrambling at the foot of a post. Then Silva struck a free kick a foot over from 22 yards. And that was about as good as it got for City in the first half.

As Song assumed total midfield control and the front runners Morgan Amalfitano and Enner Valencia began to persecute City’s centre-backs, the champions were reduced to hopeful retaliation on the break.

A West Ham success seemed inevitable, and it came in the 21st minute. Song slid a pass down the right, Valencia sprinted on, reached the byline and pulled back an inviting cross. The ball evaded Pablo Zabaleta, and Amalfitano was awarded the simplest tap-in. It was no more than West Ham’s control had deserved.

The notion that Allardyce’s side have suddenly become a team of tap dancers is fanciful. They are strong, muscular, relentlessly direct. But this should have come as no great surprise to City. They knew precisely what would confront them, and they failed to cope with the problems. For a side with title pretensions, it was woeful.

West Ham were winning battles all over the pitch, and might have scored a second when Valencia dived at a half-chance as a low cross came skidding in from Aaron Cresswell. Kompany was booked on 44 minutes for cleaning out Valencia with a peevish assault. Then, from the rarest of breaks, City might have equalised on the stroke of half time, when Aguero almost squeezed in a chance at the near post.

He failed, and it would have been a travesty had he succeeded. Pellegrini sat in the dug out, shaking his head. This was not how the plot was supposed to unfold.

The City manager sent out the same side for the second half, presumably obeying the managerial dictum which says: ‘You lot got us into this. You can get us out.’ Yet his team’s plight might well have grown even worse when the thoroughly rattled Kompany went crashing into Valencia and escaped the card which would have seen him dismissed.

Nevertheless, City started to enter the game. Toure began to appear vaguely interested, and the appearance of Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko introduced an extra sense of purpose. After 59 minutes, they had their best chance yet but Aguero’s shot was saved by Adrian’s knees. A minute later, the Argentine struck the bar and the ball bounced down to Toure, who drove it into the goalkeeper’s midriff from four yards.

By now, the fight was on, and City seemed more likely to prosper when an interchange between Silva and Aguero allowed Toure to bounce a drive against the angle of post and bar. But in the 75th minute, West Ham appeared to strike the decisive blow, when Cresswell, advancing down the left, flighted a cross and Sakho, leaping immoderately, scored the header, becoming just the second player to score in all of his first six Premier League starts.

But, as Upton Park celebrated, City began to play their most impressive football of the match. At last, the fluid movement which had been absent returned with a rush, and their reward arrived within two minutes. Silva picked his way nimbly from the right, deceived Mark Noble, and swirled the most precise drive inside the far post.

From there on, the match was up for grabs, with City making despairing efforts to take the consolation of a point. But West Ham survived the frenzied attacks, and at the final whistle, they collapsed in claret and blue heaps all over the field; exhausted, but justly triumphant.
