Manchester United striker Will Keane is the centre of a tug-of-war between Championship duo Reading and Blackpool.

The 22-year-old has made just one first-team appearance for the Red Devils, appearing as a substitute in the 3-2 defeat to Blackburn back in 2011.

Keane spent time out on loan at Wigan and QPR last season, but failed to find the net in 14 games.

However, the Royals and the struggling Seasiders are both keen to do a deal for the United academy graduate to boost their options in attack for the second half of the season.

Keane's twin brother, Michael, recently quit Old Trafford to sign a permanent deal with Premier League strugglers Burnley after impressing on loan.
