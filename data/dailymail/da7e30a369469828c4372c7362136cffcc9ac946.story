A plane with 180 passengers on board was today surrounded by security forces who mistakenly believed a hijacker was on board.

Two F-16 fighter jets were scrambled by the Dutch Defence Ministry to intercept the airbus, which was bound for Amsterdam's Schiphol airport from Malaga.

They went supersonic in their efforts to catch up - but when the plane landed, security forces discovered that there was no hijacking, and the confusion was down to miscommunication.

The dramatic security operation - sparked when the plane's pilot lost radio contact upon entering Dutch airspace - came on the same day part of the airport was closed due to the discovery of an unexploded Second World World bomb.

False alarm: Dutch air traffic control became suspicious about the plane when its pilot lost radio contact after entering Dutch airspace.

Builders digging around Terminal C at Schiphol Amsterdam uncovered the device wedged deep underground.

It will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb.

The terminal, from which flights 
regularly leave for a number of British airports including London City, 
was partially closed, with a number of flights cancelled.

Just hours later the apparent hostage situation developed.

Police said the pilot had failed to make radio contact after entering Dutch airspace, arousing suspicion with air traffic control that the plane had been hijacked.

Security staff, ambulances and photographers  - believing this was a hostage situation - surrounded the plane after it landed around 1.5km from the main terminal.

Danger: Hours before the 'hijacking' incident a terminal at Schiphol Airport had to be closed after workmen discovered the unexploded WWII bomb

Red alert: An ambulance is seen in front of the passenger plane carrying tourists from Malaga in Spain to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport

Delays: Flights from Schiphol Airport were affected by the discovery of a World War Two bomb near the airport's main terminal before the hijacking alarm

Dutch military police said at the time: 'The plane has landed at Schiphol. There is a possible hijacking and the police have surrounded the plane.

'We are trying to make contact with the people in the plane.'

National broadcaster NOS made phone 
contact with a passenger on board who told terrified listeners that the 
plane was calm and there was no hostage situation.

A
spokesman for Spain's Vueling airline later revealed the reports 
that the plane had been hijacked were due to miscommunication between 
the pilot and the control tower.

The airline said on Twitter on Wednesday
that 'Amsterdam's protocol for security was activated owing to a 
temporary loss of communication between the plane and air traffic 
control.'

The Vueling plane was parked at a remote corner of Schiphol, away from the main terminal, surrounded by security personnel and several ambulances.

Early authorities evacuated parts of the airport after workers found the 
unexploded bomb, forcing airlines to delay and cancel some flights.

The German bomb was discovered buried
underground near the transport hub's busy Terminal C, which handles 
flights to most major European destinations, the Dutch Defence Ministry 
said in a statement.

Schiphol cleared and closed Terminal C, parts of Terminal D and one landing strip, an airport spokeswoman said.

A handful of European flights were cancelled, while several dozen were delayed, she added.

The 500kg explosive, uncovered during construction work, would be taken to a safe location and dismantled, the ministry said.

Security measure: An unexpectedly dramatic day at Schiphol Airport saw a World War II bomb discovered and a hijacking alarm within hours of each other

The bomb is thought to have been 
dropped by the RAF or American Airforce during raids between 1940 and 
1944, when Schiphol was used by the German Luftwaffe.

There were regular day and night 
raids on the then military airbase, especially because the Nazi airforce
could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including Britain.

Allied bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped, all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time.

The RAF and USAAF dropped huge 
payloads of bombs on Nazi positions all over the Netherlands, as part of
the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of German-occupied 
Europe.

This figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain.

Even though the war ended 67 years 
ago, ordnance is still found all over Holland, just as it is in 
neighbouring countries such as France, and Germany itself.

However, it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world’s biggest airports.

Some 48million people travel through 
Schiphol every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how 
one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an 
unexploded bomb.

A major inquiry is expected to be launched in to today’s find.

Controlled blast: Could the unexploded bomb 
found at Schiphol Airport be detonated in a controlled explosion like a 
similar-sized device was yesterday in Munich, Germany?

Menace: Thousands of unexploded WWII bombs (like this one found in Munich, pictured), are thought to be buried across Europe
