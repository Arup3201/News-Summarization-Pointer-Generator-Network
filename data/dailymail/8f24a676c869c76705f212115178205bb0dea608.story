Schools must not bar children from their sixth forms just because they are badly behaved, the local government ombudsman has ruled.

They are prohibited from ‘taking account of a pupil’s past behaviour’ when allocating places on A-level courses even if they fear disruption.

This is despite Education Secretary Michael Gove urging schools to clamp down on classroom troublemakers.

The problems facing head teachers trying to take a hard line against indiscipline have come to light just months after the new school admissions code came into effect in February.

The Latymer School, a top-performing mixed grammar in Edmonton, North London, was yesterday accused of ‘maladministration causing injustice’ after refusing to allow a pupil to join its sixth form because of an incident of poor behaviour.

It was told by the ombudsman to ‘immediately’ admit the former Year 11 pupil. It is understood the boy was temporarily excluded for a ‘minor indiscretion’.

The ombudsman said that because the teenager had ‘satisfied the academic requirements to join the sixth form, he should have been admitted’.

It stated that the ‘law prohibits the school from selecting sixth form pupils based on their behaviour records’ and was backed by the Department for Education.

'The ombudsman is entitled to make recommendations and the governing body will do what is required, which is to consider those recommendations'

Head teacher Mark Garbett wrote to the boy’s father on April 26 to notify him about the fixed-term exclusion.

He said the boy ‘had not met the requirements to join the sixth form’ this September and it would be ‘detrimental to the school community’ if the boy was admitted. The father reported the matter to the ombudsman.

Mr Garbett yesterday refused to say whether the boy would finally be admitted. He said: ‘The ombudsman is entitled to make recommendations and the governing body will do what is required, which is to consider those recommendations.’
