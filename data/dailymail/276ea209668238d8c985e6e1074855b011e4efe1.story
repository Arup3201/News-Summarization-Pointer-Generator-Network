Staff at a piggery have been left shocked after arriving for work one morning only to be confronted by an 'ocean' of about 500 dead pigs.

It is believed that the pigs at the Pig Improvement Company (PIC) in Grong Grong, NSW, died of extreme heat exhaustion, after an air-conditioning system in the holding shed failed on February 23. 

According to an anonymous whistleblower's tip-off to The Daily Advertiser, a security company was alerted when the system faltered but they failed to contact on-call employees to notify them in time and all 500 pigs in the piggery baked to death.

Over 500 pigs have died in a piggery in NSW due to heat exhaustion after an air-conditioner broke 

Pig Improvement Company CEO Paul O'Leary claims the company, who employ 25 staff, are thousands of dollars out of pocket and all the staff are traumatised by the incident.

He said that further investigation into the disaster appeared to show that the shed did not have an adequate ventilation system. 

'We have 24-hour monitored alarm systems,' Mr O' Leary said. 

'In this instance the alert was unable to avert a disaster – a situation every business dreads.

'The consequence was distressed staff arriving onsite the following morning to discover the stock losses.'

Mr O'Leary told the newspaper that such a loss has been emotional for the staff, who invest a lot of their time into caring for the pigs. 

In May last year, Grong Grong piggery came under scrutiny when video footage appeared online apparently showing piglets in pieces and pregnant sows confined to tiny stalls. 

At the time, Australian Pork Limited told the newspaper that the video footage of the piglets scattered across the ground was clearly staged.

'These people have broken and entered in these properties in the dead of night and disturbed and distressed the animals,' Ms Mackintosh said.

'They portray this as the way the pig industry does business and that's not the case.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, animal protection group Voiceless expressed his concern over the fact that the pig deaths had been covered up.

'That these animals reportedly died in such a horrifying way, and the public and relevant authorities have apparently been kept in the dark for weeks, raises serious concerns around the transparency and accountability of this industry,' a spokesperson said. 

'This represents a disgusting and unacceptable failure to ensure animal welfare, and one which would have caused those 500 sentient beings unimaginable suffering.'

The whistleblower is apparently a member of staff and was reportedly told by management that they would lose their job if they told anyone. However CEO Mr O'Leary has denied this.
