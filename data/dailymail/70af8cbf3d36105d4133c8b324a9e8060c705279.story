A Houston jury convicted Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo (pictured) of aggravated assault on Friday

A Texas cancer doctor has been given 10 years in prison after she was convicted of poisoning her lover by lacing his coffee with a chemical found in antifreeze.

Dr. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, 43, a breast cancer doctor based at Houston's famed Texas Medical Center, was sleeping with her fellow researcher, Dr. George Blumenschein, when he abandoned her in favor of his girlfriend.

Although he survived the poisoning, prosecutors say the damage done to his internal organs has knocked years from his lifespan - and urged the juror to consider her crime tantamount to murder.  

Prosecutors said the affair turned into a 'fatal attraction' and she poisoned him with ethylene glycol after Blumenschein spurned her in favor of Evette Toney, his longtime live-in girlfriend with whom he was trying to start a family. 

Gonzalez-Angulo was convicted of aggravated assault on Friday.

During closing arguments, prosecutors asked jurors to sentence Gonzalez-Angulo to at least 30 years in prison,for stealing years from Blumenschein's life.

Blumenschein testified last week that his life span was shortened by the poisoning as he now has only 40 percent of his kidney function.

'Don't feel bad for one second about sending her to prison. She did that herself,' said prosecutor Justin Keiter.

Defense attorney Derek Hollingsworth asked jurors to sentence Gonzalez-Angulo to probation, saying she should not be judged solely by this one event in her life. He pointed out the work she had done helping patients during her career.

On Friday, several patients told jurors Gonzalez-Angulo was a compassionate person who had tirelessly worked to treat them.

'It's not the right result to send her to prison for a lengthy period of time ... When you look at the entirety of her life, (probation) makes sense,' he said.

Hollingsworth said probation will not be easy for Gonzalez-Angulo as her conviction means she will never practice medicine again.

Keiter said Gonzalez-Angulo's good work as a doctor should not excuse her actions. He said probation would not fix what is wrong with Gonzalez-Angulo.

'You cannot fix evil, you can't. You can't fix someone who is cold and calculating and manipulative,' he said.

Blumenschein told jurors that he became sick Jan. 27, 2013, not long after he and Gonzalez-Angulo had been intimate, and that he immediately suspected his lover of spiking his coffee.

Witnesses testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center where she and Blumenschein worked.

The defense team had noted a prosecution expert's testimony that Blumenschein could have ingested the poison two days earlier.

Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys had argued during the trial that other people, including Toney, might have been responsible for the poisoning, an allegation that Toney has denied.
