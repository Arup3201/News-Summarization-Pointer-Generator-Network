Prolific: Thomas Harney was caught trying to break into an abandoned parish hall in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, adding to his 120 criminal convictions

A pensioner with more than 120 convictions spanning half a century has landed himself back in court after a botched burglary.

Thomas Harney, 68, admitted ‘old habits die hard’ after be was caught trying to break into an abandoned parish hall in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, looking for scrap.

Police also found cannabis on him after he admitted he was under the influence of drugs.

Harney pleaded guilty attempted burglary and possession of a Class B drug to add to his criminal history which dates back to the 1960s.

He represented himself as he appeared before magistrates and told them: 'I thought I had changed, but old habits die hard.

'I was financially under burden and had utility bills to pay.

'I took over my brother’s cat and dog when he died.

'I was hard up and thought I might make a few quid from scrap. I was under the influence of drugs at the time. In hindsight, I would say how stupid it was.

'I have my pets to look after, and it is the first responsibility I have had in my life.'

South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court heard that Harney had tried to burgle St. James’ Parish Hall which is unoccupied and awaiting demolition.

Neil Woodward, chairman of the magistrates, told him: 'You have a substantial record. A number of matters have resulted in you losing your liberty.

'I feel a community order is appropriate. It will be a six-month community order with a two-month curfew from 8pm to 8am.

'When you are going to take your cat and dog out for a walk, don’t do it between those hours.'

Not learning from the past: The pensioner told magistrates he 'thought he had changed' before being sentenced

Harney, of Hebburn, was also ordered to pay court costs of £50 and a victim surcharge of £60.

The court heard how Harney had broken into a local business and stole more than £1,000 from the till in November 2010.

He
 was given a 12-month community order and told to do 150 hours of unpaid
 work.

Harney was jailed for 18 months for supplying cannabis in 2006.
