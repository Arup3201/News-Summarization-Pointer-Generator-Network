Britain is set to suffer its wettest autumn for over a decade with more rain and gale winds sparking further flood warnings.

After the UK’s wettest summer in a century, England and Wales are now on course for the wettest start of autumn for 12 years, the Met Office has said.

The southwest has seen five times the usual amount of rain so far this, drastically increasing the risk of floods for the forthcoming week.

The Met Office warned of ‘no let up’ with showers tomorrow and Monday, followed by blustery showers on Tuesday and rain for all on Wednesday - with a severe weather alert issued for floods in the southwest.

The outlook to October 27 said: ‘Continuing very unsettled with rain or showers for most parts, occasionally heavy, with strong winds.’

England and Wales were drenched by 132mm of rain from September 1 to October 10 and with no sun on the horizon, the UK is on track to push the September and October rainfall total to around 220mm. This is the highest since 2000, the wettest autumn on record, when 302mm fell.

St Mary’s, Isles of Scilly, has had 124mm of rain - compared to the 11-day October average of 27mm. Cornwall’s 107mm at Camborne is more than 300 per cent of the usual 34mm.

This autumn’s downpour is especially dramatic as a majority of the rain has fallen in the past three weeks. Met Office forecaster Dave Britton said: ‘The first three weeks of September saw relatively little rain.’

British Weather Services tweeted: ‘Three significant bands of rain will fall over the next week, with already high river levels and water tables.’

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘There’s no let up in the pattern, with bands of rain next week interspersed with drier periods.’

The Met Office added: ‘Ground in the South-West remains saturated and the threat of further heavy on Wednesday means the public are advised to be aware localised flooding is a risk.

'It wasn't my fault': Michael Fish

As the 25th anniversary of the Great 
Storm approaches, Michael Fish, the weatherman who famously announced 
there was nothing to worry about, has insisted the prediction was not 
his fault.

Hours before Britain’s worst storm for
 300 years, BBC forecaster Fish famously announced: 'Apparently a lady 
rang the BBC and said she heard a was hurricane on the way. Well, don’t 
worry, there isn’t.’

During the Great Storm 1987, 18 people were killed and 
15 million trees uprooted as 115mph winds caused more than £1billion 
damage across southern England.

Fish, 68, blames former colleague Bill Giles for issuing the wrong forecast and said he did warn of the storm.

Fish, who now works for independent 
forecaster Netweather,said: ‘There’s a fallacy about my role.

'I was on 
duty the morning before the storm but Bill Giles, on the afternoon 
shift, gave the incorrect forecast not mentioning horrendous gales.

‘The famous hurricane remark was taken
 out of context. We don’t get hurricanes in Britain and I actually said 
“batten down the hatches for extremely stormy weather.”’

The Met Office, which reacted to Great
 Storm by introducing the severe weather alert system, said four-day 
forecasts are now as accurate as one-day forecasts in 1987.
