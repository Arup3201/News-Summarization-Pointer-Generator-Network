Victory: Ned RocknRoll leaves London's High Court after winning his legal battle to prevent a tabloid newspaper from publishing semi-naked pictures of him

Kate Winslet’s husband today won his high court battle to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published.

Ned RocknRoll, who married the Hollywood actress a few weeks ago, went to London’s High Court to prevent a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics’.

The images of the 34-year-old, who is a nephew of Sir Richard Branson, were discovered on a Facebook page.

RocknRoll, who changed his surname 
from Edward Abel Smith, was granted a temporary injunction last 
Thursday, shortly after The Sun newspaper contacted Winslet’s publicist 
about the pictures.

The newspaper yesterday contested the injunction.

This afternoon Mr Justice Briggs ruled in favour of Mr RocknRoll preventing the newspaper from publishing the photos.

He will outline his reasons for the decision at a later date.

Mr RocknRoll and Miss Winslet said 
later in a joint written statement: 'We have stopped The Sun from 
publishing semi-naked photos of Ned taken by a friend at a private 21st 
birthday party a few years ago.

'The photos are innocent but embarrassing and there is no reason to splash them across a newspaper.

'We
recognise that in the internet age privacy is harder and harder to 
maintain. But we will continue to do what we can, particularly to 
protect Kate's children from the results of media intrusion.

Kate Winslet's husband Ned RocknRoll, pictured together, went to London's High Court to prevent photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published

'We refuse to accept that her career means our family can't live a relatively normal life.'

The
Sun’s publisher, News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, 
argued the pictures, which were taken from a publicly accessible 
Facebook profile belonging to RocknRoll’s friend, James Pope, were 
already publicly available.

The
group also said that RocknRoll is a public figure and has a lower 
reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen.

RocknRoll’s
lawyer, David Sherborne, told the court yesterday that the pictures of a
‘partly naked’ Rocknroll in a fancy dress costume were taken at a 
private party, which had the theme ‘outrageous’ and would cause distress
to him if they were printed.

Mr
Sherborne told the court: ‘This application is not to hide some guilty 
secret, as I said in the interim hearing. It is not to keep something 
secret. The claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his 
privacy.

‘It was a private 
party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to
see these photographs as anything other than private family photos.’

He told the court and judge Mr Justice Briggs that the photos showed Rocknroll indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party. It is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures.’

Privacy: Mr RocknRoll's lawyer David Sherborne said his wife's children would be bullied if the pictures were published

Mr Sherborne added that RocknRoll was ‘horrified’ at the prospect of the pictures being published.

He explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ‘considerable embarrassment and humiliation’ for Winslet and her children, who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public.

He also said that he was not a role model and had been a ‘relative nobody’ prior to his marriage to Winslet in December.

RocknRoll, who was previously head of marketing for Branson’s Virgin Galactic space-exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer, was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit, married the Titanic star in a low-key ceremony in New York in December.

The hearing follows the publication of a report in March last year by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis.

RocknRoll is the latest in a long line of figures and celebrities to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of their private lives.

In 2011, Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced banker who took the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse, obtained a High Court injunction.

The order, which bans mention of matters Sir Fred wishes to keep secret, was disclosed in the Commons by Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming using parliamentary privilege.

Footballer Ryan Giggs also took out an injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model Imogen Thomas, despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet.

Hemming again used parliamentary privilege to name the player, saying 75,000 people had already outed him on Twitter.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
