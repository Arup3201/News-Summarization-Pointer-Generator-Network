Guilty: Jeremy Forrest (pictured yesterday) faces up to seven years in jail when he is sentenced today for taking the then 15-year-old on the run

A girl who fled to France with her married teacher vowed yesterday to wait for him after he was convicted of abduction.

The sobbing teenager mouthed ‘I love you’ and ‘I’m so sorry’ to Jeremy Forrest, 30, as the jury delivered a guilty verdict.

He faces up to seven years in jail when he is sentenced today for taking the then 15-year-old on the run. But a family friend says the pair remain ‘desperately in love’ and plan to resume their relationship as soon as he is free.

In other developments in the case:

The jury heard how Forrest started grooming the ‘infatuated’ girl while teaching at Bishop Bell Church of England school in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

The maths teacher first kissed her in his classroom when she was just 14. When she turned 15, they swapped topless photos by text and he seduced her at secret meetings at his house while his wife was out.

When other teachers repeatedly warned him against encouraging the girl he told ‘bare faced lies’ and said nothing was going on.

He even telephoned the teenager’s mother to complain about the effect the ‘falsehoods’ could have on his career.

But after police were tipped off last September, the pair fled to France on a ferry in what was described as ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’.

Despite using false names and dyeing their hair, they were caught eight days later in Bordeaux.

The girl was brought home and Forrest was extradited back to Britain. She sat weeping in the public gallery yesterday as the verdict was delivered following an eight-day trial at Lewes Crown Court.

'They still love each other. It has survived his arrest and trial and everything else. Once he is released he plans to go straight to her and restart their relationship'

Family source

Before she gave evidence last week, Forrest had not seen the girl since his arrest in September.

He telephoned his father from jail the night after seeing his lover give evidence to tell him: ‘I feel normal for the first time.’

The family source said: ‘They still love each other. It has survived his arrest and trial and everything else.

'Once he is released he plans to go straight to her and restart their relationship. The family will support Jeremy whatever his decision.’ 

Recovering: Forrest’s father, 60-year-old Jim (left), collapsed yesterday outside the courtroom as he waited for the judge to start summing up the case. He was taken to hospital by ambulance (right) but later returned home

The source added: ‘After she was brought 
home to Britain the schoolgirl wrote to his parents to apologise for 
what happened. She said she felt safer with Jeremy than she ever did at 
home, at school or with her friends.’

'They know he has done wrong but they will stick by him. He remains their son'

Family source

Close friends said the girl had changed her Facebook status to ‘In a relationship’ after returning from France last year.

Forrest’s parents have been visiting him three times a week on remand in Lewes Prison, where he has mixed with hardened criminals including armed robbers.

He has been teaching literacy and numeracy to other prisoners and reading philosophy. The family source said: ‘He gets some stick but he deals with it through humour.’

The family source added: ‘They know he has done wrong but they will stick by him. He remains their son.’

'Every aspect of our lives has been affected to some degree'

Girl's mother

Forrest’s father, 60-year-old Jim, collapsed yesterday outside the courtroom as he waited for the judge to start summing up the case. He was taken to hospital by ambulance but later returned home and was said to be recovering.

For the past two months the schoolgirl has been living with her stepfather, who is divorced from her mother. Last night after she returned home, he said they were looking forward to spending some time together as a family.

Outside court, the girl’s mother described the last nine months as ‘like living out your worst nightmare.’ She said: ‘Every aspect of our lives has been affected to some degree.’
