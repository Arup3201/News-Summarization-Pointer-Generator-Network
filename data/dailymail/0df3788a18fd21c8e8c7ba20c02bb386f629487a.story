The little and large combination of Marin Cilic and Kei Nishikori combined on Saturday night to blow the tennis world off its axis by slaying two of the finest players the game has ever known.

They set up the most unlikely US Open final by downing Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic with two seismic shocks at Flushing Meadows coming in quick succession.

First the 24 year-old Nishikori, just 5’ 10” and eleven stone, braved fierce heat and humidity to beat world number one Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-6 7-6 6-3 in two hours and 52 minutes.

Then Cilic, the 6’ 6” giant from Croatia who served a doping ban last year, overpowered Federer as the weather turned more stormy, ousting him 6-3 6-4 6-4 in just an hour and three quarters.

Monday’s totally unforeseen climax will be the first Slam final since 2005 without a member of the so-called Big Four, and the first in twelve years not to have anyone from the top ten in it.

Cilic, now coached by former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, put in a performance of huge aggression that ended with three aces in the final game to take out a bewildered Federer, who had looked on for another Major title.

Meanwhile Nishikori becomes the first player from his country to make a Slam final. He handled the brutal conditions better than the reigning Wimbledon champion, who for once was outlasted.

It was a brilliant display from the number ten seed, whose nerve occasionally failed him but eventually held out to pull off a seismic result against the strong favourite for the title, who defeated Andy Murray in the previous round.

'It’s an amazing feeling I’m so happy,' said an ecstatic Nishikori afterwards. 'I hope I can recover for the final. I hope it’s big news in Japan.'

Remarkably, world number eleven Nishikori came here having not played in August due to an operation to remove a cyst from his foot:' I just started playing points few days before the tournament,' he said. 

'I didn't even know if I should come to New York, you know, so I wasn't expecting anything actually. But after playing first match and second match I get more confidence on my foot and it was no pain in these moments. I was start sliding little more. But my tennis was there already.”

Quarters: Federer had endured a grueling quarter-final, beating Gael Monfils in five sets

Final: Marin Cilic reaches his first ever final at the US Open in Flushing Meadows

Djokovic was at a loss to explain a surprisingly lacklustre performance and was reluctant to blame the punishing environment: 'It was not easy to play in these conditions, but he had spent more hours on the court before this. So it's no excuse,' said Djokovic. 'I couldn’t control the ball, didn’t have the balance.'

Trained at the Nick Bollettieri/IMG academy in Florida from the age of fourteen, Nishikori’s experience of American summers came into its own as he refused to flag against Djokovic.

His coach Michael Chang seemed more animated than he ever was as player as he watched from the bench, urging on his young charge, who actually lost in the first round of this event last year to Britain’s Dan Evans.

Nishikori, whose previous Grand Slam best was losing to Murray in the 2012 Australian Open quarters final, showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the Madrid Open final before seizing up with cramp, but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career.
