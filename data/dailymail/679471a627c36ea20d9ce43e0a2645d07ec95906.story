Tragic: Elvira Campos, 10, was shot to death on Saturday night after gunmen opened fire on her family's home

A 10-year-old girl was shot dead while watching TV after gunmen opened fire on her family's home.

Elvira Campos was killed when at least two suspects sprayed the property with bullets, in North Highlands, near Sacramento, California.

Her father and mother were also injured in the attack, on Saturday night.

At least two gunmen are believed to have carried out the shooting, which took place at around 10.30pm.

About a dozen shots are believed to have been fired at the home from two different weapons.

Four holes were clearly visible in 
the living room window of the property, where the girl
is believed to have been sitting.

Bullet holes could also be seen in the property's front door and in the frame around the front window.

Sheriff's spokesman Jason Ramos said the youngster's parents are expected to recover from their wounds, the Sacramento Bee reports.

Detective
Scott Swisher said the family were innocent victims and that they were 
not involved in any disputes that the police are aware of.

He said the suspects came to the house in a vehicle, but that there is no description as yet, according to the Bee.

The family is only believed to have lived in the house for about two years before Saturday's shooting.

Scene: The youngster had been watching TV in the living room of her North Highlands home in Sacramento when the shots were fired, according to the sheriff's office

Deadly: Four bullets could clearly be seen in the living room window. The girl's mother and father were also injured in the attack

The schoolgirl, who has two older 
brothers, died after being taken to hospital.

She was described by a 
relative as a happy character who 'knew everybody.'

The
youngster's 14-year-old brother is reported to have been working on his
computer in another room, when the shooting took place, the Bee 
reports, while her oldest brother, 20, was not home at the time.

Attack: Bullet holes were also visible in the house's front door. Police said the family were 'innocent victims' and that they were not involved in any disputes that officer's are aware of
