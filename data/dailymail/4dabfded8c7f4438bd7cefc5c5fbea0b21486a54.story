Enough shale gas to keep Britain self-sufficient for a decade is sitting untouched under the UK, experts said today.

A buoyant report from America's Energy Information Administration (EIA) says the UK's 'technically recoverable' shale gas reserves are at 26 trillion cubic feet (tcf) - which is almost ten times what Britain consumes a year.

Extraction has already started in the North West of England, and the UK is 
thought to have significant shale gas resources in South East England, 
the Midlands, Central Scotland and the Welsh border.

But EIA's scientists also said today fracking has 'got off to an abysmal start' in Britain after it triggered 'two earthquakes' near Blackpool, with 'political 
opposition' highlighted as the main threat to it happening.

Untapped: A test drilling site for shale gas on the outskirts of Southport, Lancashire, one of the areas of Britain which could hold enough to keep the UK self-sufficient for a decade

Their study also said that for the first time shale oil could also be extracted, with an estimated 700million barrels-worth waiting to be tapped.

The new figures are a shot in the arm for the industry, as estimates on obtainable volumes of fossil fuels continue to rise.

In a 2011 study, the EIA said technically recoverable shale gas 
resources were 20 tcf, while a year earlier the 
British Geological Survey (BGS) said it was more likely a quarter of that total - 5.3 tcf.

Fracking involves firing water and chemicals into rocks to 'hydraulically fracture' them, which then releases gas or oil.

Heartlands: More than ten times as much gas lies under the North West of England than previously believed - and it could make the UK self-sufficient for at least 10 years. The red areas highlight where shale gas is thought to be present

Process: The controversial technique of fracking uses a high-pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock

Operations close to 
Blackpool were halted in 2011 and led to an 18-month moratoriumamid concerns about the process after two 
small tremors struck in the area.

Problems: A test drilling site for shale gas at Preese Hall Farm near Blackpool. The area was hit by two earthquakes previously in what experts have called an 'abysmal start to fracking in the UK

The company working in Lancashire, Cuadrilla says there could 200 tcf where they are working.

Only a proportion of the total volume 
will be accessible to the shale gas industry but even if just 10 per 
cent of the North West’s reserves can be brought to the surface it could
end the entire UK’s dependency on foreign imports for a decade.

But opponents
of fracking claim that it is unsafe. They argue that drilling could 
scar the British countryside and clog roads with hundreds of lorries 
transporting gas and dirty water.

There are also concerns that the chemical composition of the fracking fluid- which is believed to contain upwards of a hundred different chemicals- could pollute water supplies.

The EIA has admitted that fracking, which is much more widespread in America, is a more complicated process in the UK.

'Compared with North America, the shale geology of the UK is considerably more complex, while drilling and completion costs for shale wells are substantially higher,' their report said.

'While the UK’s shale resource base appears substantial, commercial levels of shale production are yet to be established.'

The report went on: 'political opposition to shale development is greater in the UK than in Poland', which is Europe's leader, adding: 'Hydraulic fracturing got off to an abysmal start (in Britain). The UK’s first shale production test well triggered small local earthquakes'.

The word 'fracking' comes from the term 'hydraulic fracturing'.

Water, sand and cocktails of chemicals are piped into shale rock formations deep underground.

Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock
made up of mud that is a mixture of clay minerals and tiny fragments 
particles of other minerals, such as quartz and calcite.

The high 
pressure injection causes the rock to fracture, creating fissures along 
which previously trapped gas can flow and be extracted.

The sand and the chemicals help keep the fractures open and lubricated.

The first experimental use of hydraulic fracturing was in 1947 and the first commercially successful uses were in 1949.

In 2010, it was estimated that 60 per cent of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured.

As of 2012, 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing jobs have been performed on oil and gas wells worldwide.
