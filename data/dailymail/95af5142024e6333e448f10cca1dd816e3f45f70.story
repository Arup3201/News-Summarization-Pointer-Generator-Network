Jihadists are encouraging attacks on Australian teachers working in Australia and abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised.

Teachers at the East Hills Boys School in Sydney have been asked to monitor their students after 'ISIS R coming' was sprayed across the school building in graffiti paint. 

Fayaz Kanaan, also know as the ginger jihadist, attended the school before leaving to join the Islamic State.

He has since returned to Australia, after his father intercepted him in Turkey.

According to the Daily Telegraph, teachers at the school have been asked by the AFP to monitor all students for radical tendencies following the incident.

'The AFP and its partners are spending significant time in schools and the community to encounter extremist narratives,' a spokesperson told the newspaper. 

Students at the school have been counselled over the war in Iraq and Syria.

They have been told to notify their teachers should they be apprached by recruiters of a terrorist group. 

DFAT on Friday night updated its terror threat advice in light of an online forum post, which urged attacks against teachers at international schools around the world.

However, DFAT says it's not aware of any specific information to suggest an attack is being planned.

"A recent posting on a jihadist forum website encouraged attacks against teachers, including Australian teachers, at international schools around the world," the advice said.

"The post does not represent planning for an attack, nor are we aware of any specific information to suggest an attack is being planned.

"We encourage Australians involved with international schools, who may have concerns, to engage with the school to ensure it is aware of the threat and that appropriate security arrangements are in place."

The jihadist post notes the presence of international schools in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan, Tunisia, Nigeria, Morocco, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia.

It makes specific mention of two schools - in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and the suburb of Ma'adi, in Cairo, Egypt - where numbers of teachers at international schools reside, DFAT says.

The new advice follows the federal government last month raising the domestic terror alert level to high.

DFAT reminded Australians that even where attacks may not specifically target Australian interests, Australians could be harmed.

"In the past decade, Australians have been killed and injured in terrorist attacks in Nairobi, Mumbai, Jakarta, London and Bali."

Travel advisories for Australians are available on the smartraveller.gov.au website and are reviewed and reissued regularly.

Jakarta International School, which has Australian teachers and students, says its parents and employees have been informed of the DFAT advice

Jakarta International School, which has Australian teachers and students, says its parents and employees have been informed of the DFAT advice.

The school, which was founded by the Australian, US, and British embassies, says it will now review its plans for security upgrades.

"JIS has a robust security posture that is evaluated on a systematic basis and in light of developments such as those referenced in the DFAT bulletin," it said in a statement.

The news comes after a senior US congressman provided chilling details about an Islamic State terror plot to kidnap and behead an Australian

"We will be reviewing the timing and scope of planned security upgrades."

The news comes after a senior US congressman provided chilling details about an Islamic State terror plot to kidnap and behead an Australian.

The chairman of the US House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, told FOX News 14 Australian IS recruits were 'ready to go to Syria' at the time and 'further their radicalisation'.

But Rogers said the recruits were told to stay in Australia.

He said they received a note from IS which said: 'No, No. What we want you to do, stay in Australia. We want you to randomly kidnap people off the street, behead them, videotape it, send it to us for further propaganda.'

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton said the remarks were likely a reference to the  dawn terror raids on September 18, the largest the nation has witnessed.

Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist offence during last month's counter-terrorism raids

The operation, which involved over 800 police, saw Omarjan Azari, 22, arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.  

Prof Barton said it was unclear what briefings Rogers had received on the matter, and whether his remarks about Australians intending to flee to Syria were accurate. 

'He seems to be speaking with some confidence on these (issues)', Prof Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told Daily Mail Australia.
