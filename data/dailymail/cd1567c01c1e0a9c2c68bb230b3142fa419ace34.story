Two British men are being hunted after police raided a Dutch cafe believed to be at the centre of an international drug trafficking ring.

Robert Gerrard, 50, and Michael Moogan, 
27, both from Liverpool, are wanted 
for allegedly importing large amounts of cocaine onto Britain, after a series of raids throughout the UK and the Netherlands.

Officers from the National Crime Agency and the Dutch National Crime Squad descended on a coffee shop in Rotterdam as part of the major operation investigating the drugs smuggling operation.

The Dutch cafe, which could only be entered through a buzzer system, was allegedly used by criminals from across the world as a meeting place for negotiations with cartels and for arranging the financing and transportation of huge quantities of drugs.

Two handguns, more than 100 mobile phones, 300,000 in euros (£257,000), a cash counting machine, a radio scanner, a radio jammer and expensive watches were all discovered in the shop.

As part of the operation, police seized nine handguns, two semi-automatic rifles, a cocaine press and a total of 200,000 euros (£171,000) at addresses across Rotterdam.

Two Turkish brothers suspected of running the operations centre were among 10 men arrested in the Netherlands.

Three men have been arrested in the UK, a 64-year-old from Hale, Greater Manchester, a 36-year-old from Harlow, Essex, and a 47-year-old from Brentwood, Essex.

Police also searched addresses in Liverpool linked to Gerrard and Moogan.

Drugs: The pair, both from Liverpool, are alleged to have smuggled large amounts of cocaine into Britain

Steve Baldwin, regional head of investigations for the National Crime Agency, said: 'We believe this cafe was being used as a front for a drug trafficking operations centre with international reach.

'This was a well established set up which was open 18 hours a day. It appears you were only allowed in if your face was known.

'Taking it out of operation will have caused serious disruption to the activities of organised crime groups across the world.

'We suspect those arrested in the UK and the two men we are now seeking - Gerrard and Moogan - have used the cafe to orchestrate the importation of large quantities of drugs to the UK.'

Anyone with information on their whereabouts should contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or the NCA on 0370 496 7622.
