Forget tracksuit bottoms and scuffed up trainers - students starting university this month will be the best dressed in history, with more than a quarter turning up to campus with wardrobes worth more than £2,000.

A new survey shows that the class of 2014 will be a world away from the traditional student stereotype of holey jumpers and ageing Doc Martens.

Indeed, 28 per cent say they will be looking to stand out from the crowd with a host of designer brands - saving their best and most expensive looks for Freshers’ Week.

Among the favourite items heading off to campuses all around the UK will be statement Mulberry handbags, Alexander McQueen T-shirts, Burberry trench coats and Prada loafers, the survey revealed.

Less than one in ten (7 per cent) will pack a wardrobe worth less than £500 and 83 per cent said there was a pressure to look good when they first arrived.

A spokesperson for Johnny Tuxedo, who conducted the survey during London Fashion Week, said the results aren't surprising.

'You only have to look at the teenagers of today to see how seriously they take their fashion,' he said. 

'Not only will they stand out at the Freshers’ Ball, they’re also going to be standing out at lectures given the amount of high-end clothes they’re packing for their studies.'
