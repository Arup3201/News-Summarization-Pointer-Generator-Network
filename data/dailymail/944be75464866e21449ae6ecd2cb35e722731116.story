The National Mall got a taste of the apocalypse this morning when 1,000 dead fish floated to the surface of one of the park's ponds.

The fish were found lifelessly bobbing on the surface of the Constitution Gardens pond at the National Mall Thursday.

Carol Johnson, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said there was nothing suspicious about the incident saying it usually happens each summer.

The reaping: About 1,000 dead sunfish floated to the surface of the Constitution Gardens pond in the National Mall this morning

Ongoing problem: A National Park Service spokesman explained that the pond's closed system made this a normal occurrence during the hot summer months

Since the pond isn't near a river, the ecosystem isn't able to refresh itself.

When the weather gets warm the algae dies and when it dies it sucks oxygen out of the water, killing the fish.

Ms Johnson said most of the fish killed were small sunfish, about three or four inches long.

Carp and bass are some of the other fish in the pond, but were relatively unaffected by the mass death.

Ms Johnson told ABC News that the pond's closed off construction makes it an 'ongoing problem' but that they've 'identified it as an area that needs to be worked on.'

Cleaning up: The park spokesman said they were unsure whether the fish would be replaced

Reconstruction: A pond redesign is necessary to stop the problem happening in the future

She told MailOnline that the pond needs a 'wholesale reconstruction' and that the pond may get that when the Trust for the National Mall votes to start one of two new projects.

The trust is a non-profit the NPS partners with and they recently launched a competition to redesign both the Constitution Gardens and the Washington Monument Grounds.  They will soon vote on which project to start first.
