Amazon has come under fire for selling a fancy dress costume of a golliwog.

The online shopping giant has not removed the outfit from sale despite receiving a flood of complaints from furious customers.

Many commenters have denounced the costume as 'racist' because of its links with outdated stereotypes about black people.

'Racist': This golliwog outfit is currently on sale on Amazon through a third-party company

The outfit is advertised as an 'Adult Golly Fancy Dress Costume' and is on sale for £39.99.

It is being listed on Amazon by Orion Costumes, an independent company which also sells 'sexy' outfits such as a schoolgirl costume.

The golly kit includes a mask and wig as well as striped trousers, a tailcoat and an oversized bow tie.

The official product description reads: 'Our amazing Golly Costume is a fantastic recreation of the popular rag doll character and is ideal if you are looking for a memorable outfit!'

A number of angry browsers have left one-star reviews on the Amazon website, calling for the outfit to be removed from sale.

On sale: Amazon has refused to remove the outfit despite receiving a flood of complaints

Anger: Just one of the furious complaints left by customers on Amazon's website

Michelle Coke wrote: 'This should not be an item for sale and should be removed immediately. This is offensive and show lack of sensitivity on the part of Amazon.'

Another user said: 'This is repulsive and offensive. Amazon take this down! Did you go back in a time machine to the 1940s?'

And a third added: 'This costume is ridiculous. I don't need to say any more than that, I can't believe it's even on sale really.'

Anti-racism campaigners have also called on Amazon to apologise for the outfit.

Hellen Pattison of Youth Against Racism told The Sun: 'Yet again Amazon has shown they will sell highly offensive and demeaning products, as long as they can make a profit.'

Iconic: The golliwog was once a much-loved children's toy which appeared on jars of Robertson's jam but has since become tainted by the use of the term as a racist slur

Withdrawn: This 'zombie Jimmy Savile' outfit was taken down from Amazon last month

The outfit is still available on the site, which is the world's dominant online retailer, and Amazon has refused to comment on the controversy.

The golliwog was long treasured a popular children's book character and famously appeared on jars of Robertson's jam for more than 90 years.

However, after it became a term of abuse aimed at black people it has become increasingly taboo.

Nonetheless, dozens of golly-themed products are available on Amazon, including dolls, clocks and keyrings.

The U.S.-based retailer was heavily criticised last month after allowing a 'zombie Jimmy Savile' Halloween costume to be sold on the site.

Amazon withdrew the outfit following a national outcry.
