Deontay Wilder, having taken the hallowed WBC heavyweight belt back to America on Muhammad Ali’s 73rd birthday, is ready to give Tyson Fury a shot at the world title.

The big man from Alabama is even willing to bring that gift to England. Be careful how you unwrap it, Tyson. Think Trojan horses.

Wilder is the most dangerous US heavyweight since Mike Tyson and is being hailed as the giant most likely to end the Klitschko domination of the ring’s marquee division.

After massively outpointing the first Haitian-born heavyweight champ, Bermane Stiverne, in Las Vegas on Saturday night, Wilder said: ‘I want Fury next, then Wladimir Klitschko for all the other titles by the end of this year. 

'Me and Tyson would be one helluva fight. We’re both big punchers and entertainers. 

'I would love to do it in the UK, where I’ve always enjoyed my visits. No problem for me.’

Those trips to Britain are reported to have included the occasional flattening of David Haye in sparring.

Wilder had also knocked out all 32 of his opponents prior to this weekend inside four rounds. But it is the composed, complete style of his 12-round outclassing of Stiverne which heralds the prospect of a genuine all-American hero.

Wilder worked so effectively behind a ramrod jab, with such mobility and such variety of follow-up punching, that he represents a real threat to Klitschko who, like the new champion, stands just two inches shorter than Fury at 6ft 7in. 

Tyson Fury (right) - who Wilder wants to fight next - easily beat Derek Chisora in a world title bout in November

Wladimir Klitschko's last bout ended with a fifth-round knockout win over Kubrat Pulev in November 2014

Fury became the WBO mandatory challenger to multiple alphabelt champion Klitschko when he stopped Dereck Chisora late last year. 

But the younger of the two brothers is in negotiations to face another American, Bryant Jennings, in New York this April. 

There is also talk of Klitschko switching to Wilder for that date, perhaps in the hope of catching him before he benefits from more experience of the big time.

If Wilder goes on to prove himself the first Real Deal since Evander Holyfield, this Bronze Bomber could be the saviour of heavyweight boxing. 

Wilder v Fury this spring, the winner against Klitschko in late summer, the loser versus Joshua in the autumn — now there’s a schedule to reinvigorate the hardest old game.

Meanwhile, Wilder’s 33rd straight win will surely have brought a smile to Ali’s face if he was well enough to tune in upon his return home from hospital. 

It has also put paid to Don King’s amusing but nonsensical notion of dragging Mike Tyson out of retirement to fight Stiverne. All in all, a good Saturday night’s work.
