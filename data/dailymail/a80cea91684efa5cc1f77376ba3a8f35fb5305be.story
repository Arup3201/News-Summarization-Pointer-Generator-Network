Heartbreaking: Even when a grave was dug for the puppy, its brother jumped into the hole too refusing to leave

The brown puppy was protecting the body of the grey one from being hit by any passing cars  by jumping up and barking if one got close. 

They remained in the same place for several days until a person moved them to safety at the side of the road.

Another member of the public then dug a hole to bury the grey dog.

Even then, its brother jumped into the hole too refusing to leave its companion.

Eventually, the brown dog was collected by staff from a local animal protection centre where it is being cared for.
