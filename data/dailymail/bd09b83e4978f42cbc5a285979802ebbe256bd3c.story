Lewis Hamilton feels Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg was handed 'another gift' after a qualifying crash again put the Briton on the back foot in this year's Formula One world title fight.

Hamilton suffered a failure of the front-right brake disk during the initial session for the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim.

On approach to the left-handed loop inside the stadium complex, the failure immediately pitched Hamilton into a high-speed spin across a gravel trap, with his momentum halted by a 30g shunt into a tyre barrier.

Unsurprisingly winded, Hamilton was at least able to radio back to his team, pointing out: 'I put my foot on the pedal and something failed.'

Hamilton eventually clambered from the cockpit of his car, raising his right hand to acknowledge he was okay, before heading off to the medical centre for a medical inspection which is routine procedure following such a crash.

The 29-year-old will now start 15th, moving up one place from his qualifying position of 16th due to Esteban Gutierrez serving a three-place grid penalty.

To rub salt into Hamilton's wounds, Rosberg unsurprisingly went on to claim his fourth pole from the last five grands prix, and ninth of his F1 career.

Not for the first time this season Hamilton faces another exercise in damage limitation to ensure the current four-point gap between the duo does not become too excessive again.

Reflecting on his accident, Hamilton said: 'I'm in a little bit of pain, but that's what happens when you have a crash like that. Even if something is broken I will still be racing on Sunday.

'I think (the team) said I pulled something like 30g, but you never enter a corner thinking something will happen.

'Nico has now basically got another gift (with pole), but we will see what we can do.'

Hamilton and Rosberg use different manufacturers for their brakes as it comes down to feel rather than a team dictating what a driver should have on the car, with the former Brembo and the latter using Carbon Industrie.

Hamilton's brakes were also new going into final practice earlier on Saturday, but whatever the circumstances, this is the latest qualifying blow to a man renowned for his speed over one lap.

For Rosberg, this result continues his great week after getting married, watching Germany win the World Cup and signing a new long-term contract.

'Things have been going really well, and to be at my home race and to get pole is fantastic,' said Rosberg.

Sparing a thought at least for Hamilton, he added: 'I would have preferred an open fight with Lewis, so I'm a little bit less happy he didn't have a shot at it at the end.'
