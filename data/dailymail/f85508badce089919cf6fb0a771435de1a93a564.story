Lisa Danielle Stockbridge pleaded guilty to dealing drugs in some of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs

A popular Sydney socialite who led a double life dealing drugs from the front seat of her 4WD told her customers they could 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. 

Lisa Danielle Stockbridge, 42, from Kings Cross, has pleaded guilty to selling cocaine, MDMA and MDA to buyers in wealthy suburban streets all over Sydney.

Court documents tendered at Downing Centre Local Court said Stockbridge would text deals to her 198 customers at one time- one of them was 'introduce a new customer and get $50 off your next gram', reported the Daily Telegraph. 

The mother of two sold drugs haul from the front seat a black Range Rover, which was registered to her entertainment website Urban Society — a job that saw her rub shoulders with Sydney's celebrity set at red carpet events.

The Telegraph reports that Stockbridge used codes for drugs, including 'happs' or 'bags' for cocaine and 'hats' or 'blondies' for ecstasy.

Stockbridge believed she was being carefully and told her customers not to talk and would tell them to 'ssshhh' if they disobeyed the rules. 

Police installed 'optical' and 'listening' devices inside Stockbridge's car on September 5, 2013, and were recording evidence of the socialite handing over drugs for cash.

Stockbridge pleaded guilty to four charges, including supplying a commercial quantity of MDA and supplying cocaine and MDMA on an ongoing basis.

Her lawyer Martin Ricci, from The Law Practice, negotiated for eight charges to be dropped in exchange for the plea, reports The Telegraph.

In an agreed set of facts it said police began tapping one of Stockbridge's phones in November 2012.

The documents revealed that the socialite told her buyers the hours her drug business operated and on November 17 she sent a text to her 198 customers saying: 'Extended hrs 2nite till 10.30'.
