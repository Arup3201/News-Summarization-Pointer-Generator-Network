Some people go to extraordinary lengths to achieve fame.

Step forward this daredevil, known only as Christian, as he runs at full pelt from a herd of oncoming bulls - a contender for the most dangerous selfie ever. 

The extraordinary images of the young man sprinting away from the rampaging, horned beasts at the Houston Bull Run in Texas made it onto the front page of social news and entertainment website Reddit, as well as Houston Press.

Daredevil: Christian taking a video of himself being chased by bulls

One runner was injured and was treated in hospital for cuts, scratches and concussion

Organizers of the event said they wanted to replicate the famous Spanish bull-running spectacle Pamplona

One onlooker took a photo of Christian's dangerous selfie, which was posted on Reddit along with the accompanying caption: ‘selfie level 11 achieved’- a recognition of the level of risk attached to the stunt.

In Christian’s own video, crowds of people, many dressed in white outfits with red scarves around their necks, can be heard counting down from 10 as the herd of bulls is released. 

A voice can be heard shouting '36 bulls' as the animals are set free, before one daredevil in the crowd bellows 'hold your line!'.

Seconds later a clearly nervous and excited Christian can be seen huffing and puffing in anticipation as the thunder of hooves is heard in the distance. 

He then starts running with an expression halfway between bewilderment and fear etched across his face. 

As the animals fly past, there is widespread shouting and applauding, but a crowd can be seen gathering around an injured man who has been trampled. 

More than 3,000 people took part in last month’s Houston Bull Run, with only one man, student Hugo Soto, treated for injuries in hospital. 

Injured thrill-seeker Soto was treated for scrapes and bruises to his face, arms and hands as well as concussion. 

Organizers of the event said the idea was to bring the great Spanish bull-running spectacle Pamplona closer to home.
