His best-known characters characters are famous for their clothes.

But the Cat in the Hat and the Fox in Socks have previous little in common with the stars another Dr Seuss tale.

Indeed, the gang of naked sisters who star in The Seven Lady Godivas: The True Facts Concerning History’s Barest Family, are famous for wearing no clothes at all.

Not the usual: Dr Seuss penned this saucy book in 1939 - but it never gained much popularity despite featuring pages of cartoon nudity

The famed author, whose birthday yesterday is now celebrated as a national reading festival, wrote and illustrated the failed exhibitionist tome in 1939.

But despite his efforts to 'draw the sexiest babes I could', it only sold 2,500 copies, and went out of print.

As a recent feature in Mashable details, the book retells the English legend of Lady Godiva - who rode naked through the streets of Coventry to protest her husband's unfair tax hikes.

However, Seuss altered the story by multiplying the number of nudes by seven - and making sure they stayed that way at all times, rather than just to prove a point.

In a foreword to the out-of-print tale, he wrote that he was correcting an inaccuracy in inserting six more naked women into the story - and that their nudity was a source of 'pride'.

Not quite: Dr Seuss is much better-known for other creations, such as the Cat in the Hat

Change of heart: Seuss, also known as Theodor Geisel, decided to stick to children's books after The Seven Lady Godivas

Seuss, real name Theodor Geisel, wrote that he was in fact telling 'a beautiful story of love, honor and scientific achievement'. 

Publishing the book was allegedly a condition for Random House, Seuss's new publisher, when he jumped ship to them. 

However, it seems few agreed with his own high opinion of the bawdy tale. While 10,000 copies were printed, only 2,500 were ever bought.

He later accepted that the book was no good. According to The Atlantic, he said: 'I attempted to draw the sexiest babes I could, but they came out looking absurd. 

After the experience he turned his back on the adult audience. His New York Times obituary records him once saying: 'I'd rather write for kids. They're more appreciative; adults are obsolete children, and the hell with them.' 

Before Dr Seuss decided that she should have six naked cartoon sisters, Lady Godiva was a well-known figure in English legend, whose story introduced Peeping Tom into the world.

Godiva was a real historical figure who lived in the 11th-century city of Coventry, and was married to Earl Leofric of Mercia.

According to folklore, she rode naked through the streets to free her people from her husband's oppressive tax regime.

Original: Lady Godiva was the legendary wife of an English earl, who rode naked through the streets of Coventry as a protest against an unfair tax on his people. She is pictured above in an 1898 oil painting by John Collier

Godiva had begged her husband to lift the onerous taxes time and again - but failed to persuade him.

Eventually, he said he would only relent if she completed the implausible task of riding naked through the streets - which she agreed to.

To preserve her modesty, she asked all the citizens of the town to clear the streets, shutter their windows and look away. According to the story, everybody complied except a tailor called Tom.

But after stealing a glance, he was struck instantly blind. He, and people like him, were known forever afterwards as a Peeping Tom.
