Love conquers all and that's certainly the case for Iraq War veteran Tomas Young, who had wanted to end his life after being left paralyzed by a sniper's bullet in 2004.

The 33-year-old, who was left quadriplegic after medical complications, had said at the start of this year that he was in too much pain to live anymore.

But the support and love of his caregiver-turned-wife Claudia Cuellar has given Mr Young a more positive outlook.

Power of love: Tomas Young and wife Claudia, who he says has giving him the strength to stay alive

'I just came to the conclusion that I
 wanted some more time with my wife. And I 
decided that I really don't have the chutzpah to go ahead and do away 
with myself,' he told NPR.

His change of heart shows how much has changed for Mr Young in the space of a year.

In March he announced that he intended to refuse food, saying: â€™I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.'

Since the fateful day he was hit by a sniper's bullet in Iraq's Sadr City, the soldier turned anti-war campaigner has been in chronic pain.

Medical complications after the initial injury resulted in him becoming quadriplegic, and a pulmonary brain embolism in 2008 made him less mobile.

'I decided that I was no longer going to watch myself deteriorate,' Mr Young said earlier this year.

But, with the New Year approaching, the 33-year-old said his 'amazing wife' who he married in April 2012, has given him reason to live.

'Since she's come into my life, I'm happier than I've ever been and I want to leave her alone for as short a time as possible ... I love her and my love for her is stronger than my desire to kill myself,' he told ABC's Nightline.

Earlier this month his wife thanked Robert Miltenberger for saving her husband. He was sat next to Mr Young when he was shot, and kept him alive by pressing on the wounds while they still under fire.

The men hadn't seen each other since 2004, but as they were reunited Ms Cuellar said: 'You saved him' as she explained that the couple would never have met if it hadn't been for Mr Young's injuries.

'It's been a very difficult journey but sometimes the hardest journey you learn the most ... if there wasn't love, this wouldn't be possible,' she said.

Ms Cuellar added: 'We just want to celebrate our life. It's hard, but it's not sad.'

The couple, who live in Portland, Oregon, will see in the new year with a party at the Portland Art Museum.

Mr Young, who
 famously 
wrote an open letter to Bush and Cheney chastising them for going to war
 on Iraq, hopes his change of heart will encourage others who may be 
feeling low.

'If you're in life and you start to 
think things are a little too rough to handle just think of 
me and what I go through, and you realize that "Hey, I don't have it so 
bad",' he said.
