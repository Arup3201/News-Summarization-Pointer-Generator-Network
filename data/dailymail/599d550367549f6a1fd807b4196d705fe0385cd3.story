The page has attracted dozens of tributes to the tragic trio.

Veronica Gutierrez, Shannon's aunt, wrote to thank everyone for their prayers and donations and paid tribute to both her niece and Joshua.

'Our family loved Josh and we always encircled him in our family. He was quiet and very respectful. He was so good to Shannon, always looking out for her and taking care of her. We always knew that Shannon was safe with Josh. Josh and Isaiah are a true reflection of their parents...FANTASTIC parents. 

'Shannon was so beautiful but what made her even more beautiful was her personality. She was caring, loving, and full of life. Whenever she entered a room it was as if someone turned on the lights. 

'She was an excellent daughter, she looked after her parents, and she loved her brother and nephew. 

'Our hearts are broken!! I can't believe that these kids are no longer with us. I will miss them so much.'
