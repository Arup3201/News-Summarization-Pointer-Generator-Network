According to the modern man, the height of romance is giving their partner control of the TV remote.

The answer appears in the top ten romantic gestures as voted by  2000 British men and women in a recent survey.

After sacrificing the remote control, the other top choices from the men included 
offering to clean the house (11 per cent), putting the bins out (seven 
per cent) and leaving the toilet seat down (seven per cent).

Washing the dishes and doing the ironing was also rated as a 'romantic' thing to do.

However, it seems not all men are oblivious of how to keep romance alive as 37 per cent voted for surprising their partner with bouquet of flowers while 31 per cent opted for offering to cook the dinner.

Both of these answers were the women's top choices for a romantic gesture followed by being run a hot bath.

Managing director Iain Martin, from Moonpig, who commissioned the research, said: 'A nice bunch of flowers is usually what women want but perhaps us men are a bit guilty of trying to think outside the box too much and I guess that's why some think that the remote is the key to being romantic.'

However, some of the men admitted they felt wary of presenting a bouquet to their loved one in case it made them appear guilty of something.

A fifth believed that their partner would get suspicious if they give them flowers when it wasn't a special occasion.

The Welsh were the most likely to fear suspicion with 13 per cent highlighting this was a worry, compared to just eight per cent in the south west of England.

It was something they needn't be worried about as only seven per cent of partners said they would be suspicious.

When it comes to flowers, roses were the favourite choice for more than a quarter of women, followed by lilies. 

The study also found it's been almost two months since men got it right in the romance department, with women even having to tell their partner what they think is romantic to get what they want.

Three in five (60 per cent) of the UK's long suffering females have to leave subtle hints around the house so their partner gets it right. Meanwhile, more than a third said they had to be very blunt and come straight out with it. 

It's not just men that are getting it wrong however; two in five women have to be told what their man finds romantic as well. 

Chocolates and flowers were found to be the most common gift both men and women receive from their partners.

But while many believe that a gift from their other half should be worth £84.21, those Brits then go on to admit they only spend half of that (£42.65) when dipping into their own pockets for their partner.  

The research also discovered that Londoners have the highest expectation from a gift, saying £102.36 is a reasonable amount to be spent on them, compared to those in the West Midlands, who are happy to receive something worth £72.67.

Those between the ages of 45-54 were found to be the most generous, with their most expensive gift costing £368.17.
