Ill treated: 84-year-old Marion John

A heartbroken daughter has revealed how her mother was moved nearly once a week in the five months leading up to her death.

Heart patient Marion John, 84, was moved 17 times between three different NHS hospitals and her care home, before dying at  Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest on May 17 last year.

Her daughter, former nurse Megan Busby, criticised doctors telling an inquest at Milford Haven that the 'communication was dire' and said it was responsible for her mother's rapid deterioration.

According to family members Mrs John, from Narberth, Pembrokeshire was 'sharp and 
independent' before the heart valve replacement surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea in January 2010.

Despite her death certificate stating that she died of bronchial pneumoniaÂ  it was revealed at the court hearing last Friday that it was bleeding from the aorta that led to her death - a typical 
complication with someone of Mrs John's  age.

It was only after Mrs John's family disputed the cause of death and a post-mortem examination was ordered by the coroner that the internal bleeding was discovered.

Speaking out against her local health care trust Mrs Busby said: 'The family had lost confidence in the care she was receiving.'

She added that her mother's care home in Tenby, West Wales, Withybush hospital, the General Hospital in Carmarthen, and Morriston Hospital. failed to communicate effectively.

Mrs John developed a series of infections in the wounds in her chest, suffered internal bleeding at the point where a new heart valve was inserted and fell and broke her leg while at Morriston Hospital.

She was also due to be transferred from Withybush Hospital to Morriston Hospital but the ambulance had to turn around midway on discovering that there were no beds available, despite her pleading 'with the crew to go on'.

Mrs Busby also told how her mother had been prescribed oxygen towards the end of her 
life, but she found her 'gasping for air' and not on 'oxygen or fluids'.

And when mother died, it took medics five minutes to arrive after she rang the call bell.

Hywel Dda health board apologised for the care and Iain Robertson-Steele, director of clinical care, at 
Withybush Hospital, said: 'The health board regrets the distress caused 
by the circumstances surrounding this case and apologises to (Mrs 
John's) family.

'We will review the case in the light of the inquest to ensure any relevant lessons are learned.'
