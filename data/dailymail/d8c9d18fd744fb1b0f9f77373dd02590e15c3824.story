Turtles are the 48 year old's favourite marine animals to pose with as they are 'usually so chilled out and relaxed' as this photo shows

He also had an interesting dental floss experience by a cleaner shrimp

 So whenever a sea creature dropped by he would jump on the opportunity to turn the camera and take a picture of himself with the animals.

'Turtles are my favourite as they are usually so chilled out and relaxed so I have a few shots with them.'

'I also have ones with barracuda, whale sharks, lion fish, big blue Napoleon wrasse, potato cod and jellyfish.
