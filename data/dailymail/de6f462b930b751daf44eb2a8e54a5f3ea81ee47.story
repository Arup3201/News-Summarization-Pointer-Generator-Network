Her personal life may have suffered a blow after discovering boyfriend Lewis Bloor had been cheating on her, but Lauren Pope's professional life is booming.

The TOWIE star, who maintains that her career will always come first, has seen her clothing line and hair extension brand go from strength to strength in recent months.

So popular has her Hair Rehab London business become that even style queen Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has been wearing her extensions on X Factor in recent weeks.

Success story: Lauren Pope, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, established her hair extension brand, Hair Rehab London, in 2007 and now she has countless celebrity fans

Speaking to MailOnline about her latest fan, Lauren said: 'It's pretty amazing to think that anyone is wearing a product I've designed and created and it's always exciting to see those results. So when the products are on a big name like Cheryl it does give you a great buzz.'  

Established in 2007 - three years before Lauren joined hit TV show The Only Way is Essex - Hair Rehab London began as a MySpace business and today employs a host of staff and sees sales increase by an average of 270 per cent annually.

To start up the company and secure investment for her ideas, Lauren entered Tycoon - a business TV show, which gave start up companies six weeks to set up. Each week, Lauren explains how she would pitch for further investment and advice, learning invaluable business lessons as she went along.

Speaking about her success, Lauren said: 'I decided to set up my own company as, at the time, I found I was having to make my own hand sewn extensions due to a lack of affordable styles on the market. I looked in to the business and manufacturing behind it, secured investment and started by selling through MySpace. It all took off from there.

'A lot of people don’t realise that I had a successful business before I joined TOWIE and that I balance being an entrepreneur alongside taking part in the show. 

'Hair Rehab London has always been important to me and I work hard to ensure the company keeps on growing and my team is happy. It’s been great to see the business go from strength to strength - it’s a testament to the quality of the product that people keep coming back to us.'

Her products are available with 100 per cent real hair and synthetic styles in clip-in extensions, plaits, buns, ponytails and headbands, with prices ranging from £9.99 to £139.99.

Since founding the brand, Lauren can count the Little Mix girls, Sam Faiers, Denise Van Outen, and Sarah Harding as her fans - and she said it would be 'super exciting' to see Nicole Richie wearing them.

As well as working on Hair Rehab London, Lauren is a professional DJ and recently unveiled her third clothing collection for In The Style.

The star, who often wins style plaudits on the show, explains that she likes to mix up different  looks dependent on her mood.

'Fashion has now become such a big part of my life, especially since starting my Style Diary last year,' she explained.

'One of my favourite things to do is try out new styles and ideas and share these ideas via social media. I tend to always keep it pretty demure these days but always try and add a sexy twist in there somewhere, either by showing a bit of leg or tummy.'

Lauren, 32, is constantly complemented on her youthful looks and, unlike a lot of her Essex pals, who swear by lashings of fake tan and false eyelashes, Lauren prefers to keep it pared-back when it comes to her beauty regime.

'I try to keep it as simple as possible by using a gentle facial cleanser by Biore and then use a moisturiser and eye cream,' she told us.

'I love Estee Lauder for eye creams or serums, they're a little bit more expensive but you see the results. I love these products especially now I've stopped having Botox - I can see signs of ageing around the eyes slightly more now I'm in my thirties.'
