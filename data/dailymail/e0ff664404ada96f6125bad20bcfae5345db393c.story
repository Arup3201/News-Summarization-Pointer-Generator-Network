The wife of a man who died after rescuing their two children from drowning in Australia has her husband 'died a hero'.

Andrew Priestley, from Leicestershire, died in hospital after getting into difficulty at Burrill Beach - around 155 miles south of Sydney on Australia's east coast.

He fought desperately to keep his two boys Matthew, 12, and Daniel, 10, afloat after they got caught in strong currents at the beauty spot.

But once they were rescued, he was unable to save himself.

After entering the water and rescuing the children, it is believed Mr Priestley may have suffered a heart attack.

He was later found floating face down in the water and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital .

Mr Priestley, a businessman from Market Harborough, was on a three-week road trip from Sydney to Melbourne with his wife, Amanda, and their children.

Mrs Priestley, 43, said she stayed on the beach with their daughter Amelia, eight, while her husband and sons went into the water.

Matthew and Daniel were said to have screamed in panic as they were dragged under by strong rip currents.

Mr Priestley fought his way across the waves and lifted his sons onto a surfboard, while others pulled them to safety.

Mrs Priestley's father Terence Collins said: 'Amanda said that Andrew died saving the children.

'She said that he managed to lift them onto a surfboard and other people there pulled it onto the beach. But by the time they came back for Andrew he had been washed away by these terrible rip currents. His body was found face down in the water. He died a hero.'

Mrs Priestleyâ€™s sister, Susan Collins, added: 'Andrew used all his energies to get the boys onto the surf board. He died a hero saving them.'

Died: The 44-year-old man is believed to have suffered a heart attack when he dived into the water to help his sons at Burrill Beach, near the port of Ulladulla, south of Sydney

A
 statement released by the Foreign Office on behalf of the family said 
it was 'heartbreakingly impossible' to imagine life without him.

The statement said: 'The family of Andrew are devastated about his death in Australia. He died after saving his children.

'Andrew was the most amazing husband and father that any family could wish for. He adored his family and we adored him.

'The support and messages we have received have been overwhelming and we are thankful for that.

'It is heartbreakingly impossible at this moment to imagine our lives without him.

'We would ask that our privacy is respected at such a sad time.'

Australian police said both children were uninjured. A report is now being prepared for the coroner.

A
 statement from New South Wales Police Force released yesterday said: 
'Emergency services were called to Burrill Beach just after midday, 
where they found a man unconscious.

Caught: Witnesses said the man ran into the water when he realised that his sons were in trouble, believing they were caught in a rip - a strong undercurrent

Tragic: He managed to rescue his sons from the water, but then suffered a fatal cardiac arrest

'The 44-year-old was taken to Milton Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

'Officers
 from Shoalhaven Local Area Command attended and were told the man, a 
British tourist, got into difficulty after attempting to rescue his two 
sons who were caught in a rip.

'His sons were not injured.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that Mr Priestley had died.

He said the family, who have been offered consulate support, had been on holiday when then incident occurred.

Tributes were also paid by a football club in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, where Mr Priestley's two sons played.

In a statement on their website, Borough Alliance FC said they would hold a minute's silence before their matches today.

The
 club said: 'Andrew Priestley tragically died saving his sons in a 
swimming accident in Australia. For many years Andrew was a regular 
figure at the club where his sons Matthew and Daniel played.

'Our thoughts go out to his wife Amanda, the boys and his daughter Amelia.'

According to the paper the Milton-Ulladulla Times, this was the second death at Burrill Beach within a month.

A statement from New South Wales Police Force released yesterday said: 'Emergency services were called to Burrill Beach just after midday, where they found a man unconscious'

Burrill Beach is a popular spot among holidaymakers at this time of the year, the height of the Australian summer

A Filipino national drowned there last month.

Police said a report was being 
prepared for the coroner, while the man's family, who were with him on 
the beach, have been offered counselling.

Burrill Beach is a popular spot among holidaymakers at this time of the year, the height of the Australian summer.

But the Beachsafe website warns that 
Burrill Beach and a nearby sandy area are rated as 'highly hazardous' 
due to the persistent rips.

'However both are popular with 
holidaymakers in summer, so stay in shallow water...and avoid the rips 
and feeder currents; and in the south use extra caution near the inlet 
entrance,' says Beachsafe.

The beach is backed by 10 to 20m high dunes and a central caravan park with a walking access to the beach.

Rips are found every 300m and against the nearby headland, Beachsafe warns.
