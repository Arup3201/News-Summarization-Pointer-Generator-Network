Athletic Bilbao are persevering with their interest in Arsenal's Mikel Arteta and Nacho Monreal.

Arteta has made it clear he wants to stick it out at Arsenal but Monreal may consider what is on offer back in Spain.

Both Spaniards featured in the team which were beaten 1-0 by Monaco in the Emirates Cup on Sunday with Artera captaining the side.

Keen to stay: Mikel Arteta is not looking to leave Arsenal despite the interest from Athletic Bilbao

Arteta moved to Arsenal from Everton in August 2011 for a fee of £10million having previously had spells at Rangers and Real Sociedad.

Monreal, meanwhile, moved to the Emirates from Malaga in January 2013.

Arsenal remain in the hunt for another holding midfielder although Jack Wilshere could also be used there.

Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho is available as his club want to cash in now at £24m but Morgan Schneiderlin is expected to go to Tottenham.

Heading home? Nacho Monreal could have been tempted by a return to Spain 

Real Madrid say they have yet to receive a bid for Sami Khedira but won't let him leave for free next summer. The German is due to return to training at Madrid tomorrow and will hold talks over his future.

The added attraction with Sporting's Carvalho is that he is understood to be on wages of around £10,000 a week, although his agent would obviously push for a hefty rise.
