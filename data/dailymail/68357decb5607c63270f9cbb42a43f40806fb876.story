Off-duty cops are no longer able to carry their weapons to NFL stadiums according to a new policy.

Texas is the only state in which an 
off-duty cop can carry his gun into the stadium. When checking in, a cop
 can use a special gate and inform stadium officials of where they will be seated with their gun.

The head of Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Bob Cherry, is outraged by the NFL's decision. Cherry believes that post 9-11 terrorist times call for more security all the time--even off-duty. 

NFL policy no longer allows off duty cops to carry guns on them in stadiums such as The Baltimore Ravens Stadium pictured here

The NFL statement to WBAL Radio says that off-duty cops at the game should be treated the same as spectators. Since off duty cops are not briefed on game day law enforcement planing strategy, their carrying a gun can be dangerous. 

Unlike cops on duty, off-duty cops are permitted to drink alcohol at the event. Alcohol can cause impaired judgement and therefore makes an off-duty cop with a gun a liability.Bob Cherry's reponse was, 'Many police officers across the country who don't drink at these games and are suitably armed and actually need to be armed.'According to Cherry, a month ago the Ravens allowed for off-duty cops to carry guns into the stadium but not retired cops.He was happy that the team was trying to meet his demands. Baltimore off-duty cops are actually required to carry guns on them at all times.

Cherry's solution to the issue is to have gun lockers installed in the stadium so that cops can securely disarm before entering the stadium and get their gun back once they leave. The NFL expressed their appreciation for law enforcement officials but believes that limiting the number of weapons in the stadium benefits everyone's safety. There are already assigned and armed officers in the stadium who have been briefed on the safety protocols designed for each stadium. Cherry is still pushing for the NFL to change their rule. 'You have many officers who do have season tickets, will show up at a Ravens game because they are in the city and they work for Baltimore City Police they are required to be suitably armed. Now the NFL says well you can't bring your weapon into our stadium,'said Cherry.

Jeff Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association, is also disappointed by the no gun policy.Cherry asked that any citizen or officer who agrees that off-duty cops should be able to have a gun in the stadium contact NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to tell him they disagree with his new policy.
