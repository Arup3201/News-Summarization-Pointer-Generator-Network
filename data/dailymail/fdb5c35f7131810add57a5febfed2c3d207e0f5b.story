While some women may be embarking on diets and exercise plans this January in the hope of obtaining their dream bikini body, one mother-of-four has taken more extreme measures.  

Tracey Belger, 43, from Flitwick, Beds, has spent £8,000 on a tummy tuck and liposuction because she hated her bulging belly.

After having her four children, now aged 22, 20, 16 and 11, Tracey struggled to find clothes to fit her 'ridiculous' figure as she had a size 18 stomach but slim size 8 legs.

Banish the belly: The mother-of-four hated her protruding size 18 stomach so decided to go under the knife

Her flabby stomach made her feel self-conscious and unhappy.

She said: 'My belly just dwarfed my legs and the rest of my frame - I looked ridiculous and I completely lost my confidence.

'I was constantly comparing myself to everyone around me - at family events and parties all I could think was how great while I was just the frumpy mum in the corner.'

She added: 'I thought I would never have my photo taken or be able to go to family events again I was so lacking in confidence.

'I would never be photographed - I just absolutely refused because I was so embarrassed by my big bloated stomach.

'As soon as the camera appeared I would run out of shot or turn the other way so I didn't have to feature in people's albums or on Facebook.'

Drastic measures: Tracey spent £8000 to have a tummy tuck and liposuction where two litres of fat would be sucked from her stomach

Flat stomach: Now Tracey has a size 8 figure but she needed hypnotherapy in order to go through with the plastic surgery 

Tracey decided to pay more than £8000 to have a tummy tuck and liposuction at Linia Cosmetic Surgery where two litres of fat would be sucked from her stomach. 

However, she was terrified about going under the knife so she turned to her hypnotherapist husband, Paul, for help.

Paul, 48, gave his wife a number of hypnotherapy sessions to make her feel more relaxed about her operation. 

Speaking of her determination to have the surgery despite her fears, Tracey said: 'I knew that if I had my surgery in August I would be back in slim fit size 8 trousers by November and feeling ready to slip on a glamorous dress in time for party season.

'It meant that I could start 2015 with a bang and finally be in the limelight, instead of always hiding in the background.

Confidence boost: Before the surgery, left, Tracey said she hated seeing pictures of herself but she was keen to show off her new figure before the dressings had even been removed, right, afterwards

'I'd really wanted to do something about my tummy for years but I was terrified of surgery and even though I'd booked the operation date, two days before I was having sleepless nights terrified that I would wake up mid-way through.

'That's when my husband suggested I try hypnotherapy through his clinic Develop 2 Prosper. He's never hypnotised me before but within a couple of hours it was sorted.'

As a result of her husband's help, Tracey was able to have her procedures with just a local anaesthetic and not even sedation.

Look at me! Now Tracey says she loves having her picture taken

Snap happy: The mother pictured with one of her four children said now she's 'desperate to get into the frame of every photo taken just to show off how great I look and feel'

She said: 'I waltzed into the surgery without a care in the world. The liposuction wasn't painful at all - just ticklish!'

As a result of the four hour abdominoplasty and liposuction, Tracey says she has never felt better and has gone from wanting to hide away to keen to flaunt her new figure.

She said: 'We went to a family Christmas gathering and people said straightaway they could see the difference, physically and in my personality.

'I was desperate to get into the frame of every photo taken just to show off how great I look and feel.

'Thanks to my tummy tuck I'm ready to photobomb every snap in sight.'
