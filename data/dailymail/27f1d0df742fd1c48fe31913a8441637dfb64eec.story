Mourners said goodbye to a 16-month-old toddler, who died when her dad accidentally reversed over her, by dressing up in animal onesies for her funeral.

Angel Pitts, who had just learned to walk, died from serious injuries in hospital after she was struck by the reversing car on June 14 outside her family's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

The young girl’s devastated parents called for all those attending the service to wear animal onesies and bright colours in her memory.

The young girl's devastated parents, Megin and Scott Pitts (pictured above), called for all those attending the service to wear animal onesies and bright colours in her memory

As the procession of 50 or so family and friends began the slow, silent, walk from the cul-de-sac where Angel lived and played, her parents followed directly with the rest of the crowd staying a respectful distance behind

Their request was taken up in earnest with bright pinks, yellows, and oranges replacing the customary funeral black.

Angel’s parents, Megin and Scott - donning their onesies - followed her horse-drawn hearse on foot along a three-mile walk to the Cottingley Hall crematorium from their house.

Other animals making an appearance among the mourners were a tiger, an elephant and a gorilla.

The name ‘Angel’ was picked out in pink and white flowers on both sides of the hearse.

The small white coffin could clearly be seen through the glass sides, along with a picture of Angel.

Despite desperate attempts by neighbours and paramedics to save her, she was confirmed dead a short time after arriving at Leeds General Infirmary

On the ground, outside each home in Angel’s street, lay a small bouquet of flowers.

Having grown to around 100, the funeral party was too large to fit in the small chapel and many stood outside for the half-hour service, before joining the main party in the walk to Angel’s final resting place.

Angel’s parents had earlier released a statement where they said: 'Angel Jackie-Jean Pitts died aged 16 months.

'This was a tragic accident that her father did not see coming and could have never imagined it happening.

'We would like to thank everyone for their support at this tragic time.

'Any donations are welcome, all to go to the Sweet Dreams charity that provides memory boxes at hospitals for parents that have lost a child.'

At the time of the accident, Angel had wandered out into the garden while her mother was distracted and ended up behind the car.

Scott Pitts was leaving 
the home in the family car and failed to see her as he drove away, 
reversing over the little girl.

Despite
 desperate attempts by neighbours and paramedics to save her, she was 
confirmed dead a short time after arriving at Leeds General Infirmary.

A neighbour described the tragic event: 'He
 [Scott Pitts] had nipped out on a quick errand on Saturday evening and 
realised mid-journey that he had forgotten something and had rushed back
 home.'

Her parents have requested that any donations should go to the Sweet Dreams charity that provides memory boxes at hospitals for parents who have lost a child

'He'd
 opened the garden gate and the family dog ran out into the street.

'The mother came out trying to catch the dog, all her attention was on 
the dog.

'Nobody had seen that the little girl, who had just learned to 
walk, had come out of the gate as well and had wandered towards the rear
 of the car.

'Dad then came out of the house and reversed over the little girl.'

Another neighbour said: ‘They are devastated. Even though it is an accident, the dad is blaming himself.

'It was horrendous, the other residents tried their best to help but there was nothing to be done to save her.

'She was a lovely 16-month-old girl who had just started to walk and wanted to explore the world.'
