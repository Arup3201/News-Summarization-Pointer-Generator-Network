Australia's best home is now on the market for eight million dollars.

The Perth property, which was crowned the Housing Industry Association's 2014 Australian home of the year, is complete with stunning features including five bedrooms, home theatre, infinity pool and a wine cellar.

The luxurious home, which is located in the suburb where some of Western Australia's finest mansions can be found, beat 1,300 rivals earlier this year for its innovative design and micro attention to detail.

Despite its prestigious title, the home at 42 Hobbs Avenue, Dalkeith doesn't sit high on the ranks of the country's strongest property market.

However the grand property isn't a strong competitor in the country's demanding property market as Western Australia is quieter than Melbourne and Sydney.

This comes after new research found that Australian property is now the most overvalued in the world.

The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that Australian home prices are higher than they typically have been when compared to rents and incomes.

And the Spring action season continues to break records with 80 per cent of properties under the hammer selling at a record rate. 

The auction market is also very competitive in Melbourne with over 1000 homes a week being sold under the hammer while properties in Sydney are selling well above the reserve.

Property experts say the 'lack of supply' is driving up house prices to 'crazy levels' across the country.
