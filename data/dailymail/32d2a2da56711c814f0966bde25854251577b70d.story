West Ham are now capable of mixing up their style of play to beat the Premier League's best sides, according to boss Sam Allardyce.

The high-flying Hammers recovered from going a goal down to Swansea last weekend to win 3-1, with Andy Carroll scoring twice and setting up Diafra Sakho late on.

That victory - West Ham's eighth of the season - temporarily moved the east London outfit up to third in the league, although it was the nature of the performance which really pleased Allardyce.

Writing in his column for the Evening Standard, the former Bolton manager said: 'It was very satisfying to be able to break down a team which defended in numbers for most of the game because we've invariably struggled to overcome that since we've been back in the Premier League.

'In the past, teams have sat back and we've not been able to find a way through. Now we can mix it up and break down teams who want to play that way. That's great for a manager.'

While their goals against Garry Monk's side arrived with the help of Carroll's head, the Hammers have also earned plaudits for their flowing football this season.

And Allardyce, who is preparing his side to face Sunderland on Saturday, admits he has no problem with rewarding his players with a Christmas Party, providing they don't cause any trouble.

He added: 'Managers have varying views on players' Christmas parties but I'm okay with them, as long as everyone's sensible. I make sure they know, beforehand, that if there is any trouble, it will cost them a lot of money.

'I want them to enjoy themselves - but in a sensible way. It's not like it used to be when you could go out in your home town and no one would stitch you up. Now, you have to be aware of people only too keen to make a few quid by selling pictures.

'Everyone needs a release from time to time, players included.'
