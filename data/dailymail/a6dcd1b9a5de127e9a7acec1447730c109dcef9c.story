An LA Dodgers fan stabbed to death on Wednesday was attacked after yelling 'Giants suck', it has been claimed.

Jonathan Denver, 24, was fatally wounded as he left the San Francisco Giants’ ballpark with his father and brother.

He was allegedly attacked by 21-year-old rival fan Michael Montgomery who was part of a group that had just left a nightclub and had not attended the game.

The two groups began to trade insults but the situation quickly escalated. Montgomery was stabbed and died in his father's arms, according to reports.

Tragedy at the baseball: Denver was fatally stabbed following the game on Wednesday

Michael Montgomery, 21, of Lodi, has been arrested on suspicion of homicide.

San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr told the New York Post that Montgomery made some 'incriminating statements' while in custody that led to his arrest.

The investigation is ongoing, Suhr added. Police are investigating if alcohol was a factor in the stabbing.

Montgomery's father Marty claimed that his son was simply acting in self-defense. Mr Montgomery, of Lodi, California, told the Lodi News-Sentinel that his son and his friends were attacked by Mr Denver's group without warning after they yelled: 'Dodgers suck.'

The fight escalated quickly, according to Marty Montgomery, who says Mr Denver hit his son over the head with a chair.

'It was a self-defense deal,' Marty Montgomery told the News-Sentinel.

'[Michael] got jumped. [Denver and friends] started swinging chairs and he stabbed [Denver].'

Michael Montgomery was distraught over the incident, his father said.

'He’s freaking out,' Marty Montgomery told the paper. 'He’s like, ''I saw him die in his dad’s arms.'''

The Los Angeles Dodgers released a statement following the attack.

The baseball team said: ‘There is no rational explanation for this senseless act. The pain that this has caused his family and friends is unimaginable.’
