Lasha Horton was pushed through a glass panel by her best friend at her home

A woman has admitted to throwing a model through a glass panel, ending her career as a result of the injuries she inflicted.

Genavese Justin attacked best friend 
Lasha Horton, 23, at her home in Top Valley, Nottinghamshire, soon after
 she had signed a modelling contract with Demus Castings.

Justin, 24, admitted wounding with intent at Nottingham Crown Court today. After the attack, doctors tried to heal the deep wound that went across her face and it took two days for plastic surgeons to work on.

She had hoped work could be done to retain her looks, but she had to give up her £15,000-a-year contract.

Nicholas Demus, who runs the agency, said: 'She was due to appear in music videos with some up-and-coming artists.

'I
 did have some magazines that wanted to shoot her over 2013, including 
Flavour fashion magazine, but we’ve had to start re-booking after we got
 the news.

'At the moment it
 is going to prove to be a bit difficult with her current situation 
because obviously normally facial appearance as well as physical 
appearance is very important.'

Justin
 was told today she should expect a jail term when she is sentenced next
 month. Judge Jonathan Teare said: 'The fact I am giving you bail is no 
indication of sentence. These were really unpleasant injuries.

'I will only make up my mind at sentence, when I have read the victim impact statement and an up-to-date pre-sentence report.'

The
 disturbing attack has left Miss Horton terrified to go out and 
destroyed her promising career - she needed 30 stitches to close the 
appalling slash.

She has been left with permanent scarring across her face and was just millimetres away from losing her left eye.

But she is banishing her demons by vowing to continue her work for charity and hopes to continue helping those who need her.

Miss
 Horton said: 'Although I can no longer model I would like to continue 
my charity work and I thought I could try to turn this into something 
positive.

Miss Horton said she has been left without any confidence and finds it difficult to trust people

Before the attack, Miss Horton won a £15,000-a-year with a London modelling agency but is now out of work

'This happened in a matter of seconds but it's devastated my life. I can no longer pursue the career I wanted.'

She added that people needed to realise just how much of an impact a single moment can have.

She
 said: 'I have lost a lot of modelling contracts that I was supposed to 
do. I have not been able to work since and I do not like leaving the 
house. I feel intimidated. I only go out with make-up on.

'If
 my best friend can do this to me than anyone can. I have been left with
 scars all over my body. I was the most confident person before the 
attack. A lot of people have noticed my confidence go down.

'I've
 decreased my circle of friends now and I do not trust anyone. I still 
do not know why she did it. There are so many things I want to ask her.

'You give someone so much love and care and in a split second she ruined my life.'
