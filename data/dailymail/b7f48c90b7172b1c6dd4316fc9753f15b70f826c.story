Belinda Moreton, 21, was told by a judge that she was only spared jail because of her four-year-old son

A young mother who crashed into a man's car before telling him she would get away with it because she was 'girly and dippy' has walked free from court.

Belinda Moreton, 21, had no insurance when she reversed her Renault Megane into another vehicle while performing a three-point-turn.

A court heard how she fled the scene after the owner came out of his house to investigate, but returned the next day and tried to bully him into not reporting the crash.

Northampton Crown Court heard that Moreton, who has a four-year-old son, told the owner she would deny causing the damage and would trick police into believing her by acting 'girly and all dippy'.

She then tried to convince the man to lie to police by saying that a neighbour caused the damage because she had eight points on her licence and had no insurance.

Unbeknown to her, however, the owner had secretly recorded Moreton making the threats after the accident in October 2011.Â  He went to police, and she was arrested.

Moreton, of West Hunsbury, Northampton, admitting perverting the course of justice and leaving the scene of the accident.

Steve Evans, defending, told the court: 'She is young, very young and she has serious responsibilities.

'I can see that this crossed the custody threshold but I would argue in her case that a chance can be taken with her.

'She's 21, she was 19 at the time and the reality is that she lives as a single parent in her own accommodation.

'She has full care of her young son. She is not a bad youngster, but clearly behaves in a thoughtless way on occasions.

'She is not stupid but by her own behaviour she has demonstrated some poor thinking skills.'

Moreton's solicitor told Northampton Crown Court the defendant had 'demonstrated some poor thinking skills'

Moreton, who lists herself as an estate agent on her Facebook page, was handed a four-month jail term, suspended for two years, for perverting the course of justice and 14 days in prison, suspended for the same period, for the driving offences.

Judge Lynn Tayton told Moreton the only reason she was not imposing an immediate custodial sentence was for the welfare of her four-year-old son.

She said: 'I think you've been utterly manipulative, arrogant and stupid, and if you come back before this court you can expect very different treatment.

'The picture I'm getting here is somebody who seems to think it's perfectly all right to drive without insurance and pretend she is just dippy.'

Judge Tayton also drew parallels with the case of disgraced Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce who were both jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice.

She told Moreton: 'You have seen the news the sentences imposed for this type of offence.

'One of the reasons these sentences are imposed is that the legal system depends on people giving a proper account for justice to be served.'

Moreton was also banned from driving for three years, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and given a six-month supervision order.

She refused to comment outside court last Thursday.
