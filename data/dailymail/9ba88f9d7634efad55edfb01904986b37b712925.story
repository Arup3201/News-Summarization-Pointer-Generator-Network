Cristiano Ronaldo has tipped Brazil and Spain as the two big favourites for World Cup glory this summer.

The Portugual captain will lead his own country to Brazil after beating Sweden in the play-offs, with Ronaldo scoring four goals over the two legs, including a crucial hat-trick in the second-leg.

And he expects the hosts and current holders to put up the biggest fight for the trophy alongside the likes of France, Italy and Argentina.

Hosts: Ronaldo believes Luiz Felipe Scolari's Brazil side, featuring Neymar, will be among the favourites

Pressure: Ronaldo has also tipped holders Spain to challenge to retain their crown in Brazil this summer

However, the former Manchester United star, who has scored 49 goals in 110 international appearances, does not believe Portugal or England will be among the teams who will be battling it out in the later stages of the tournament.

He told AS: 'Brazil is our sister country where they speak Portuguese and I hope to enjoy it out there.

'[Portugal] must take it one game at a time, nothing is impossible in football. The strongest teams are Spain, Brazil, France, Italy, Argentina... Any team could go on and win it but the two big favourites are Spain and Brazil.'

Ronaldo has helped Portugal to the final of Euro 2004, where they lost to Greece, and the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup where they were beaten by France, but he is not putting any pressure on himself to carry his country this time.

He said: 'I won’t be putting myself under any pressure; I don’t have to prove anything to anyone. I’ve spent many years playing at the highest level.'
