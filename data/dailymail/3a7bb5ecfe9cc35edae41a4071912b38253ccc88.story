Authorities say a former student of Brigham Young University-Idaho altered his college transcript to an F to an A so that he could get $7,000 in academic scholarships.

Jacob Mahonri Espinal is charged with two counts of computer fraud and one count of grand theft. The 24-year-old remained in the Madison County Jail on $50,000 bond Wednesday after being charged November 9.

Investigators say Espinal was a student employee with access to a computer system that allowed him to change his status from being on academic probation to being a straight-A student.

The Standard Journal reports that Espinal was also able to claim an associates degree in science he did not earn. 

Police say he also sent his altered transcript to BYU in Provo, LDS Business College and the University of Utah.

The changes were made over four semesters.  

$5,000 of the falsely awarded scholarship money was actually sent to him and spent.  

Espinal's preliminary hearing is set for Thursday.

His public defender declined to comment to The Associated Press on Wednesday.

A preliminary hearing is set for Nov. 20.  

'Although my action was driven by a good cause. I understand that I made a mistake and broke the trust of my school and law,' Espinal said in a statement to the court.
