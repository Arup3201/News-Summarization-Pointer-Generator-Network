Nick Clegg yesterday accused Jeremy Paxman of sneering at politics while making £1million a year reporting on it.

The BBC Newsnight host has admitted he failed to vote at a recent election and has criticised the ‘green-bench pantomime’ in Parliament.

But he was denounced by the Lib Dem leader, who said on his LBC Call Clegg show: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.

Criticism: Nick Clegg accused Jeremy Paxman of an abdication of responsibility for sneering at politics

‘Politics is imperfect...but at the 
end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how 
we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we go into war or not, 
how we deal with climate change.

‘It’s sometimes unedifying, but this 
idea that you just can sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everybody as 
being rogues and charlatans, and say, well therefore I’m going to wash 
my hands of the whole thing, is a total abdication of responsibility.’

Mr Clegg launched the outspoken attack on the BBC star for claiming he finds the crop of politicians so ‘unappetising’ he could not be bothered to vote.

The Lib Dem leader said he had an ‘old-fashioned view’ that anyone unhappy with politics should ‘get stuck in’ and change things not sneer from the sidelines.

He said Mr Paxman, as one of the BBC’s most high profile political interviewers, had a responsibility not to undermine democracy.

‘I just have this old fashioned view if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change. Don’t somehow pretend you can turn your back on it,' he said.

Mr Paxman has admitted his refusal to vote should disqualify himself from commenting on political affairs.

Jeremy Paxman has also turned on his fellow BBC journalists for taking part in shows like Children In Need and Strictly Come Dancing.

He said he would pay good money 'not to watch newsreaders making t**** of themselves.'

In an interview with BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright he said: 'I don’t understand why they want to do it', although he did admit that it helped to raise money for the children's charity.

He revealed he had twice been approached by producers of Strictly Come Dancing to appear on the show, but said: 'You want your head examined to do that.'

Mr Paxman's BBC News colleague, Susanna Reid, is currently appearing on the latest series of Strictly.

And it comes just days after fellow Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark ended last Halloween’s edition of Newsnight with a dance.

But he said he agreed with comedian Russell Brand’s recent assessment that voters are ‘disillusioned’.

Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.

‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’

Mr Clegg’s outburst came after a 
listener complained that too often new governments spend their time 
unpicking the work of their predecessors.

Instead,
every constituency should have a Tory, Labour and Lib Dem 
representative elected separately who would sit in Westminster in 
permanent coalition, it was suggested.

But Mr Clegg dismissed the idea out of
hand: ‘I don’t agree that we eliminate choice, eliminate the 
argie-bargie of politics, unattractive though it might seem at times.

‘Of course, imperfect though our democracy is, at the end of the
day it’s the best way we can have people articulating conflicting views
about the future and resolve them peacefully, and then govern the 
country as well as we possibly can on behalf of the people - in a way 
which is legitimate because it's backed by whatever happens in 
elections.’

The row over voting was sparked by an interview Mr Paxman conducted with Russell Brand, in which the comedian said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant.

Despite criticising Mr Brand during the interview, Mr Paxman later admitted he had some sympathy with his position.

'Russell Brand has never voted because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo-chamber. But it is all we have,' Mr Paxman said.
