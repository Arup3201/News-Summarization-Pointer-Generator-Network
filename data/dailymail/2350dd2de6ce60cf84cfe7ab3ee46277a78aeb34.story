Child porn: Geoffrey Bettley was allowed to keep working as a teacher even after he was convicted of possessing indecent images of children

A crackdown by Michael Gove on paedophile teachers was unravelling last night after it emerged that 11 already cleared to return to classrooms will not have their cases reviewed.

They include individuals who have downloaded child porn, one who kissed a pupil and another who allowed a teenager to drink alcohol.

Mr Gove announced that stricter guidance was to be issued to the teachers’ professional conduct panel in an attempt to defuse a growing scandal.

The Education Secretary acted after it emerged that the panel allowed religious education teacher Geoffrey Bettley, 36, to continue working despite a caution for downloading sick child porn images. A senior DfE civil servant then approved the ruling.

The guidance suggested that no teachers with child pornography offences would be able to work in a classroom again.

But officials have admitted they are powerless to take action against anyone who has been through the process.

It means the perverts are free to continue teaching, potentially bringing each one into contact with thousands of children.

A DfE insider said: ‘We can’t retrospectively change the guidance. The laws of natural justice and double jeopardy apply here, so old cases cannot be resubmitted to the panel.

'However, schools must carry out criminal records checks before they can hire someone, so if a teacher applied for a new job their record will come up.’

The source admitted that head teachers had the discretion to employ such individuals but insisted: ‘In practice it’s just not going to happen because no head is going to hire someone who has been convicted of possessing images of child abuse.’

DfE staff are checking records in an attempt to establish exactly how many perverts have slipped through the net. Mr Gove said: ‘The panel which makes these decisions was operating on guidance that wasn’t fit for purpose.

‘We’ve
 made it clear that if you are cautioned for viewing these sorts of 
horrific and indecent images, that should be taken into account. The 
panel should ensure that we do not have people who have been guilty of 
these sorts of crimes anywhere near children.’

Egg on face: Education Secretary Michael Gove had promised stricter guidance to ensure that no teachers convicted of possessing child pornography would be able to work in a classroom again

The
 DfE confirmed that Bettley is not working with children at present. The
 married father-of-four was working at St Mary’s Catholic High School in
 Menston, West Yorkshire, when he was arrested for downloading nearly 
200 images.

He was cautioned and placed on a 
‘barred list’ by the Independent Safeguarding Authority, although his 
name was taken off last June.

His case was heard by the National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel, which concluded that he was not a risk to children and the DfE backed the decision.

Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said he had ‘zero’ confidence in the Government’s ability to tackle child-related offences.

‘Everyone is aghast at the failure to grasp the common sense that everything must be done to ensure that these people can never go near classrooms again,’ he said.

‘They haven’t pinched a pen, they have accessed pictures of children being abused.

‘After Soham and all these inquiries we’ve had, surely they need to take this a little more seriously?’

Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were killed by their school caretaker Ian Huntley in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002. He had previously been accused of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary.

An inquiry that followed made recommendations to improve safety for schoolchildren.

Banned from teaching: Andrew Channing at his 
home in Wootton Bassett, where he refused to comment on his alleged relationship
 with an underage pupil

A teacher has escaped prosecution despite being banned from his profession after it was found he had a prolonged sexual relationship with an underage pupil.

Andrew Channing, then aged 26, was accused of taking the  14-year-old’s virginity on Valentine’s Day, 2002.

The married man allegedly had a secret relationship with her for three years.
Channing even cut the teenager during kinky sex sessions, a  tribunal heard.

The girl – known as Pupil A –  suffered a breakdown after their relationship ended and reported Channing to police about six years later.

Officers arrested him and sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, but lawyers refused to charge him.

However, a Department for Education disciplinary panel heard detailed evidence from both sides before ruling Pupil A had told the truth.

At a hearing, the science teacher denied there was any affair when she was at Greendown School in Swindon, but admitted having sex once at his house when the girl was 17 and no longer a pupil.

Pupil A said that in December 2001, they met outside school.

Channing wore sunglasses and a hat to disguise himself and drove her to his house, with the girl lying down on the back seat of the car so no one could see her.

Channing kissed her and she was said to be ‘terrified because she had never kissed anyone before’.

They then lay naked in bed together but didn’t have sex, she said.

The panel decided the case ‘proven’ on the ‘balance of  probabilities’ – a lesser standard than in the criminal courts – and that Channing’s explanation of events was ‘implausible.’

A prohibition order banning the 37-year-old from teaching  indefinitely was ratified by the Secretary of State last month.

Channing refused to comment at the family home in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire.

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said the CPS ruled the case did ‘not meet the criteria or right level for a prosecution’.
