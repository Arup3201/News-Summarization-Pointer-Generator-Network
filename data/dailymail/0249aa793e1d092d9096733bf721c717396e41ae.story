'We are only a couple of weeks into 2015, and Nintendo is already starting the year off with a bang,' said Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of Sales & Marketing. 

'With New Nintendo 3DS XL coming very soon and an enormous library of exclusive Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games launching throughout the coming months, it has never been a better time to be a Nintendo fan.' 

In the UK, there will also be a new version of the smaller 3DS.

Nintendo has also upgraded the console's processor.

'Improved CPU performance means faster loading times, so you spend more time playing,' it said.

'Many games will look and play better than ever—and several upcoming games will be built from the ground up to take advantage of this power boost.'

he base package won't include an AC Adapter, but customers can re-use any AC adapter from previous DSi or 3DS systems, or purchase one separately, Nintendo said. 

In the UK, there will also be a new version of the smaller 3DS.

The 3DS XL comes in black or blue, while the 3DS comes in black and white, with the addition of new cover plates to customise it.
