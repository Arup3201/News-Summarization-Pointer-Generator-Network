The mother of a mentally ill homeless man who died after a violent confrontation with Southern California police has accepted a $1million settlement with the city of Fullerton, California.

In exchange, Cathy Thomas agreed to not pursue any further claims or lawsuits seeking damages for the death of her 37-year-old son Kelly.

The vote was passed unanimously by Fullerton’s city council members.

‘Resolution of Ms Thomas’ claim at this time allows her to begin the healing process and avoid what would like be protracted, expensive, and difficult civil litigation,’ Ms Thomas’ attorney Brian Gurwitz and the City of Fullerton said in a joint statement.

In exchange for the settlement, Ms Thomas agreed to not pursue any further claims or lawsuits seeking damages for the death of her son, according to the Orange County Register.

The deal does not involve her ex-husband, Ron Thomas, NBC Los Angeles reported.

A judge earlier this month ordered two officers to stand trial on criminal charges in the case. Their next court appearance is scheduled for May 22.

The incident last July also prompted an effort to remove three Fullerton council members. They face a recall on next month's ballot.

Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Cpl. Jay Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and assault or battery by a public officer. Both have pleaded not guilty.

The officers confronted Mr Thomas while responding to reports that a homeless man was looking into parked cars at a transit center.

'This is another victory, on another battle,' said Mr Thomas' father, Ron. 'We're going to start a new one with the trial.'

John Barnett, Ramos' attorney, said he would seek another court's review of Mr Schwarm's ruling and did not expect his client would end up facing a jury trial.

'We're disappointed that they were held to answer but we will seek review in an appropriate manner,' he told reporters after the ruling. 'He believes, and he is innocent.

Killed: Kelly Thomas, 37, who suffered from schizophrenia, was horrifically beaten to death by police after reports of a homeless man looking into parked cars led to his probe

Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said during the hearing that Ramos' actions - snapping on latex gloves, making a fist and threatening to take on Thomas - would have led anyone to fear they were about to get beaten by police.

'Any person, any creature on this earth would have fear at that point,' Mr Rackauckas told the court.

'You're going to fight or flee because this is an imminent threat of a serious beating by a police officer who is there with a baton and a gun and other police officers.... This is going to be a very bad deal,' the prosecutor said.

Defense attorneys countered that police - who are authorized and trained to use force when necessary - viewed the incident as an encounter with a man who refused to give his name and continued to resist arrest even as multiple officers rushed to assist. Mr Thomas suffered from schizophrenia.

Testifying for the defense, a witness said both of the accused officers, Ramos and Cinelli, were in shocked disbelief at the man who refused to stop fighting them.

Ramos was holding his rib cage and out of breath after the incident in July, police forensic specialist Dawn Scruggs said. Ramos told her he had never had anyone fight him like that before, she said.

'He looked like he was in disbelief of what just happened,' Scruggs said during a preliminary hearing being held to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to have the officers stand trial.

Weapon: Attorney Tony Rackauckas holds up a taser similar to the one allegedly used as a blunt-force weapon against Mr Thomas during Wednesday's trial

Mr Barnett, Ramos' attorney, said during the hearing that the video - which was introduced by the prosecution - shows that his client made a conditional threat during his conversation with Mr Thomas, stating he wanted the man to start listening and following police orders, such as sitting with his legs stretched out and providing his name to officers.

'All that Kelly Thomas had to do was simply comply,' Mr Barnett said. 'Officer Ramos just lifts him up, he's going to arrest him. ... Not only can he do it, he must do it. He is bound to do it.'

'Officer Ramos didn't do anything that should or could kill Kelly Thomas,' Mr Barnett said, pointing out that his client is often seen on the video at the man's feet.

Prosecutors have argued that Ramos punched Mr Thomas in the ribs, tackled him and lay on him to hold him down while Cicinelli - who arrived later on the scene - used a Taser four times on Mr Thomas as he hollered in pain and hit him in the face eight times with the Taser.

After Mr Thomas lost consciousness and was taken to a hospital,  he was taken off life support and died five days later.

The coroner's office found that Mr Thomas died from compression of his chest that made it difficult for him to breathe and deprived his brain of oxygen, and facial injuries stemming from his confrontation with law enforcement.

In court, Mr Schwartz, Cicinelli's attorney, challenged those findings, noting that testimony by a paramedic who treated Mr Thomas at the scene indicates that he was breathing, although with difficulty, during the confrontation.

Mr Schwartz also defended his client's use of the Taser on Mr Thomas, who was still struggling and resisting officers' efforts to handcuff him, and said Cicinelli only swung the Taser at Mr Thomas' hand when the man made an effort to grab the weapon.

'To call that a crime is to effectively handcuff our police officers out in the field from dealing with any combative suspect,' Mr Schwartz said.

The hearing in a Santa Ana courtroom was marked by lengthy testimony from medical experts and graphic photos of Mr Thomas' injuries, including multiple bruises and a bloodied eye, while he was lying on the autopsy table.

Attorneys repeatedly played portions of the grainy surveillance video, which was paired with audio from digital recorders worn by some of the officers who were present and which brought some of Mr Thomas' supporters to tears and prompted them to leave the courtroom.

The incident last July prompted an ongoing FBI investigation to determine if Mr Thomas' civil rights were violated, an internal probe by the city, protests by residents and an effort to recall three Fullerton councilmembers that is slated for next month's ballot.

The recall was sparked after angry residents chastised the council members for failing to take significant action regarding the incident.

That was not the only shocking moment shown to the court Monday. The bloody, battered photo of the dead homeless man drew gasps at the court hearing.

Six Fullerton police officers responded to the incident. All were placed on paid administrative leave and are facing an internal investigation but only Ramos and Cicinelli were criminally charged.
