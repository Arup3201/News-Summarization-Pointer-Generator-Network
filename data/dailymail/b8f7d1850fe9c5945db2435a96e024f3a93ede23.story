Israel has warned world leaders not to give-in to Iranian demands over its nuclear program simply so it can meet a deadline to conclude a deal with Tehran.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said  that Israel won't support any agreement that allows Iran to be a threshold nuclear state.

As angry Arab-Israeli protesters yesterday took to the streets in protest of the police shooting of a young Arab-Israeli, Netanyahu spoke out saying the international community faces a 'clear choice'.

Netanyahu said world leaders needed to 'stand firm' and insist Iran dismantle its capacity to produce weapons

According to the Jerusalem Post, he said: 'It can cave to Iranian demands in an agreement that would be dangerous for Israel and the world.

'Or it can stand firm and insist that Iran dismantle its capacity to produce nuclear weapons.' 

Netanyahu spoke as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met with US Secretary of State John Kerry, European Union envoy Catherine Ashton and Oman's Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah in Oman to advance efforts to end a standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. 

According to reports the talks, hoped to end Iran's sensitive uranium enrichment work in exchange for a gradual lifting of sanctions, are happening just two weeks before a self-imposed November 24 deadline for striking a deal. 

It is suspected that Iran has secretly sought to develop the means to build nuclear weapons.

Israel has been forthright in expressing its concerns, accusing Iran of lying and deceiving the world in its pursuit for nuclear weapons.

Iran is ruled by a regime that calls for Israel's destruction and denies human rights to its citizens. 

Netanyahu said the international community must 'make sure such a regime' is not armed.

But the Islamic Republic claims that its program is entirely for peaceful purposes. 

Kerry, who arrived in Oman yesterday, has said that the U.S. and its partners were not considering extending the deadline.

However, he also said that negotiations could go beyond the deadline if major issues were agreed and there were only technical details to wrap up. 

Yesterday, shops, schools and businesses were shuttered in Arab towns and villages where a general strike was observed over Saturday's killing of Kfar Kana, 22, near the northern city of Nazareth.

Mounted police dispersed masked protesters who hurled stones and fireworks, blocked streets with burning tyres and waved Palestinian flags.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said that 22 people were arrested, among them minors.

Kheir Hamdan was shot after he attacked a police vehicle with a knife as officers tried to arrest a relative.

Police say the officers fired  warning shots until they felt their lives were threatened, when they aimed directly at him.

Relatives say Hamdan was killed 'in cold blood', with CCTV images apparently contradicting the official version.

In the video he is seen banging on a police van window with a knife before starting to run off.

Then a uniformed officer gets out of the vehicle's back door and fires his handgun at Hamdan, who falls to the ground.

Officers then drag his body into the vehicle by one arm.

Israel's attorney general yesterday convened an emergency meeting on the incident, hearing initial reports from the police internal affairs division, a justice ministry statement said, adding that the inquiry would continue. 

The incident came as Israel struggled to cope with a wave of unrest which has gripped annexed east Jerusalem for more than four months, with police facing off against youths almost nightly.

Arab students protested the Kana killing yesterday in Jerusalem, the northern port city of Haifa and in Beersheva in southern Israel's Negev desert.

In the northern Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, about 250 people rallied, among them firebrand Islamic cleric Raed Salah.

Stones were hurled at a bus on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway alongside the Arab village of Abu Ghosh, police said.

In strife-torn east Jerusalem, clashes raged in Shuafat refugee camp for a fifth straight day as masked youths held running battles with Israeli border police.

Elsewhere in east Jerusalem, masked Palestinians hurled petrol bombs at police in A-Tur and threw stones in Issawiya, with police responding with 'riot dispersal means' in both cases, police statements said.

No injuries were reported. 

Adalah, an NGO which fights for the rights of Israel's Arab minority, called the shooting 'an execution,' dismissing the police's version about warning shots.

But Netanyahu vowed that anyone breaking the law would be 'punished severely'.

He said: 'We will not tolerate disturbances and riots,' he told the weekly cabinet meeting.

Netanyah said he had instructed Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch to look at 'revoking the citizenship' of anyone calling for Israel's destruction, in a threat clearly aimed at the Arab minority of around 1.4 million -- some 20 per cent of the population.
