As a drought tightens its grip on California, farmers in the Golden State are fearing harvests of almonds, oranges and grapes could be lost.

The state's famed vineyards and other farms will be further affected by the decision yesterday to not send water from a vast reservoir system to local agencies in spring.

The unprecedented move means water supplies for 25 million people, and irrigation for one million acres of farmland, will be forced to look to other sources.

The announcement was timed to give farmers more time to determine what crops they will plant this year
 and in what quantities.

Farmers
 and ranchers throughout the state already have felt the drought's 
impact, tearing out orchards, fallowing fields and trucking in alfalfa 
to feed cattle on withered range land.

Without
 deliveries of surface water, farmers and other water users often turn 
to pumping from underground aquifers. The state has no role in 
regulating such pumping.

'A
 zero allocation is catastrophic and woefully inadequate for Kern County
 residents, farms and businesses,' Ted Page, president the Kern County 
Water Agency's board, said in a statement.

'While
 many areas of the county will continue to rely on ground water to make 
up at least part of the difference, some areas have exhausted their 
supply.'

The drought could also have a worrying impact of California's $61 billion wine industry. While the conditions will not be too damaging on the 2014 crop, it could damage the buds appearing for 2015.

It takes two years for a vine to bear fruit, so a drought this year could devastate crops for the following harvest.

'What we really haven’t seen that could happen is, if it’s dry enough, grapevines actually become damaged and start to die, so you don’t get the buds you need for the 2015 season,' viticulture professor Mark Matthews told Salon. 

'That potentially could become devastating, and it’s not like when you’re growing corn or something when you can just plant again next year. It’s a 30-year commitment.'

Friday's announcement that access to the reservoir has been cut off marks the first time officials have had to curtail the supply in the 54-year-history of the State Water Project.

Even though the 29 agencies that use the state's water-delivery system have other sources, those have also been affected by the drought.

'This is the most serious drought we've 
faced in modern times,' Felicia Marcus, of the State 
Water Resources Control Board, said. 'We need to conserve what little we have 
to use later in the year, or even in future years.'

Farmers in California's Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country, 
can draw water from federally run reservoirs and 
canals, but they will deliver just a fraction of the normal 
water allotment this year.

Director of the state's Department of Water Resources, Mark Cowin, said there simply wasn't enought water to meet the needs of farmers and cities.

The conservation efforts were intended to save dwindling populations of salmon and other fish in northern California, he added.

The state would need to experience heavy rain and snowfall every other day from now until May to get back to its average annual precipitation totals, according to the Department of Water Resources.

'These actions will protect us all in the long run,' Mr Cowin said.

The latest restrictions come after Governor Jerry Brown made an official drought declaration halfway through January. He urged Californians to reduce their water use by 20 percent.

Last year was the state's driest calendar year since records started being kept, and 2014 appears to be heading in the same direction.

A snow survey on Thursday in the Sierra Nevada, one of the state's key water sources, found the water content in the meager snowpack is just 12 percent of normal.

Reservoirs are lower than they were at the same time in 1977, which is one of the two previous driest water years on record.

State officials say 17 rural communities are in danger of a severe water shortage within four months. Wells are running dry or reservoirs are nearly empty in some communities.

State water officials typically announce they are raising the water allotment on February 1, but this year's winter has been so dry they wanted to ensure they could keep the remaining water behind the dams.

Groundwater levels already have been stressed, after pumping accelerated during the dry winter in 2008 and 2009.

'The challenge is that in the last drought we drew down groundwater resources and never allowed them to recover,' said Heather Cooley, of the Pacific Institute water policy think tank in Oakland. 'We're seeing long term, ongoing declining groundwater levels, and that's a major problem.'

Many towns and cities already have ordered severe cutbacks in water use.

With some rivers reduced to a trickle, fish populations also are being affected. Eggs in salmon-spawning beds of the American River near Sacramento were sacrificed after upstream releases from Folsom Dam were severely cut back.

Levels in the manmade Folsom Lake have fallen so low that the walls of a ghost town, submerged when the lake was created in the 1950s, have started to emerge.

The drought is highlighting the traditional tensions between groups that claim the state's limited water for their own priorities - farmers, city residents and conservationists.

Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, urged everyone to come together during the crisis.'It's not about picking between fish and farms or people and the environment,' he said. 'It is about really hard decisions on a real-time basis where we may have to accept some impact now to avoid much greater impact later.'
