Despite putting members of his own family to death, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un is known for being all smiles and waves on his many official visits around the isolated nation.

So it came as a surprise when, on Tuesday, he rebuked the national weather service for giving incorrect forecasts and using out-of-date equipment.

In a rare public dressing down of a government body, Kim urged theÂ Hydro-meteorological Service to update its equipment and improve its work.

Kim Jong-Un has issued a rebuke to a government agency in North Korea, criticising the weather service for giving 'incorrect' forecasts and using out of date equipment

Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success

'There
 are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation has not 
been put on a modern and scientific basis,' Kim said, telling the agency
 to 'fundamentally' improve its work and equipment.

Accurate
 forecasts are needed to protect the 'lives and properties' of people 
from disasters caused by 'abnormal climatic phenomenon', he said.

Calling
 the weather service 'very important work directly affecting the overall
 economic affairs', Kim also underscored the need to 'modernise 
meteorological observation equipment at a high level', KCNA said.

It
 was not clear when Kim visited the agency, but public criticism of 
government officials during field trips by North Korean leaders is 
extremely rare.

Usually Kim's official visits are marked by broad smiles and adoring crowds while Kim praises the work people are doing, in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success.

During the visit, Kim gave forecasters, who stood stiffly to attention around him, some 'field guidance'

He said agency did 'very important work' protecting the 'lives and properties' of the North Korean people

Undated
 pictures released by KCNA showed Kim giving 'field guidance' inside the
 weather service in the capital, as agency workers stood to attention 
around him with arms by their sides.

North
 Korea has suffered regular chronic food shortages under the ruling Kim 
dynasty, with the situation exacerbated by floods, droughts and 
mismanagement.

In
 May, state media reported that North Korea was hit by its worst spring 
drought in more than three decades, threatening thousands of acres of 
staple crops.

But that didn't stop Kim visiting a vegetable farm in Sadong District, Pyongyang, on Tuesday.

Kim
 said that the farm turned into a vegetable production base for the 
citizens of the capital city under the guidance of former leaders Kim 
Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.

The smile was back on for a visit to a vegetable farm in Pyongyang on Tuesday, however, with Kim keen to praise growers for their vital work
