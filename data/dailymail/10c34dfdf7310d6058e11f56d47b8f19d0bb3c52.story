Shocking figures about cheddar's high-salt content surfaced in November, when the Mail reported that the cheese can 
contain as much salt as junk food products, and a single portion has a greater 
amount of salt than a bag of crisps.

And it seems supermarkets are responding to the news accordingly as the first ever reduced-salt mild cheddar cheese launches in the UK today.

The ground-breaking cheese, which will go on sale exclusively at more than 600 Tesco stores, will offer health-conscious British shoppers a cheddar with a 30 per cent reduction of salt.

Cheese, especially cheddar, is one of the most popular foods in Britain but also one of the biggest contributors of salt to the UK diet

Cheese, and especially cheddar, is 
one of the most popular foods in Britain, but it is one of the biggest 
contributors of salt to the UK diet, along with bacon and bread. 

Alarming levels of salt in cheese contribute to high blood pressure, which is responsible for 
strokes, heart attacks and thousands of early deaths a year, reported Consensus 
Action on Salt and Health (CASH).

With more people than ever watching their salt intake Tesco believes this new cheese will fill an 
important gap in the market.

Tesco cheese category buying manager 
David Chamberlain said: 'Cheddar is the most consumed cheese in Britain 
with plenty of different varieties to suit a wide range of tastes - from
mild to extra strong and even those that can reduce your cholesterol.

'There are also several different fat-reduced cheddars available, but now shoppers across the UK will have easy
access to a reduced-salt variety for the first time.

'This cheese has been developed over several years by one of the UK's top dairy producers and we believe it stands up well against regular mild cheddars. We also think it will inspire other cheese makers to follow suit.

100g of cheese can contain 1.5g to 3.5g of salt.

50g/2oz cheddar - a piece the size of a small matchbox or the amount you'd get in a cheese sandwich - contains 0.8g salt.

You could try replacing high-salt cheddar and feta with mozzarella and cream cheeses, which are relatively low in salt.

The cheese has been made for Tesco by 
award-winning dairy producers Joseph Heler, who have become well known 
for their ground-breaking work within the reduced fat cheese market.

Small amounts of salt are essential for health, but Tesco and Heler were conscious that there are a number of people within the UK who are watching their salt intake yet still want to continue to enjoy every day foods.

Tesco nutritionist Karen Tonks added: 'Reducing salt consumption is an important factor in helping to reduce early deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. 

'Cheese is a popular product both as a snack and as an ingredient and is a good source of calcium and protein but its salt content means that you have to keep an eye on the portion size. 

'Now with a reduced salt cheese in the range it means it is easier to balance salt intakes - especially when combining with other foods that also contain salt - and with a great flavour the family won't notice the difference.'

Heler's Reduced Salt Mild Cheddar costs £1.88 per pack (£7.52 per kilo).

The low-salt cheddar passed the FEMAIL taste test

FEMAIL can't really tell there is reduced saltiness - a feature of cheddar we particularly enjoy

FEMAIL couldn't spot cheese's reduced saltiness...

.... but it does taste a bit more like Edam than cheddar
