Strong storms have been wreaking havoc as they barreled across North Carolina this weekend – and one scared witness caught some of the mayhem on camera.

Ed Braz, of Brier Creek, took video of an entire section of a condominium complex collapsing during the violent storm.

He was talking about how scary the storm was while taking the video in the town near Raleigh when the building came down into his back yard.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The storms have spawned tornadoes, ripped trees out of the ground and knocked out power to nearly 50,000 people, according to WTVD.

A man and a woman, were killed Saturday in separate car accidents, and a handful of others were injured as winds gusted up to 86 miles per hour, according to both WTVD and CNN.

Those gusts topped wind speeds during two recent hurricanes, CNN noted.

The male, 33, ran off the road in a torrential downpour. The woman, 50, died from injuries sustained when she was hit by a falling tree limb.

No injuries: Thankfully no one was inside the collapsing buildings, and no one outside them was injured

Demolished: The buildings were reduced to a pile of splinters in less than a minute

The most dramatic scene came courtesy of Mr Braz.

He sounded nervous while taking the video and talked about the dangerous storm.

Then, as if on cue, a deafening sound came from in front of him and a whole section of the condo was literally blown down.

It was still under construction, and no injuries resulted from the collapse, but the building was left in a giant heap in Mr Brier’s backyard. The collapse took out four units, according to WTVD.

Winds then howled through the opening left by the collapsed building and brought an eerie fog and mist into Mr Braz's backyard that cut visibility down to almost zero.

The powerful storm roared through the area on the back of a cold front that is bringing round two of the Polar Vortex to the northern half of the US.
