Well-known brand names for everyday products like toothpaste, peanut butter, ketchup and coffee have been sprayed all over the walls of a Canadian city by a street artist.

Photography graduate and artist, Dorota Pankowska, known as Dori the Giant, has tagged a series of brand logos using the product they represent.

Her project, called Pro Bono Promo, was taken to the streets of downtown Brampton, a Canadian city in Southern Ontario, where she painted product logos using the product they promote.

Minty: This Colgate toothpaste logo was created using actual tubes of the toothpaste

Ketchup: The iconic Heinz brand is recreated in tomato sauce - not paint

Clean: The Gillette logo is made by slathering shaving foam over the template

Chocolate: Nutella was the brand that inspired Miss Pankowska to start her artwork

The advantage of Dorota's graffiti is that it washes off easily.

The
23-year-old created the Maxwell House logo by dry-rubbing its powdered 
coffee on to a wall; Sharpie's brand mark is replicated in magic marker;
Colgate is applied with a toothbrush on to red brick; and the Gillette 
logo lathered in shaving foam on the side of a salmon-coloured school 
building.

Miss Pankowska creates her designs by 
enlarging a brand's logo in Photoshop, prints it out in pieces, and from
there creates a stencil. All of the artwork is done overnight under the cover of darkness.

Miss Pankowska said: 'This street art series was inspired by Nutella. I was thinking about doing a street art series in Brampton since there isn't much of an art scene here, and since I'm a huge lover of Nutella my first thought was to express my love for chocolate by putting the Nutella logo around the city. I then thought it would be a good idea to make it out of Nutella. Eventually I went even further and turned it in to a big logo series.'

Miss Pankowska explained that some of the logos didn't last very long and were removed quickly or deteriorated on their own.

Coffee: Powdered coffee was rubbed all over the wall to create the company's logo

Usually on a hotdog: French's mustard logo painted in the yellow sauce

Washable graffiti: The Skippy logo is painted in peanut butter

Popular pen brand Sharpie was drawn using the branded pens

Cheesy: This logo changed colour and went translucent after it was up for a while
