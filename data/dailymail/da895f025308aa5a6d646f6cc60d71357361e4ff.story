Halfway into their Europa League group stage campaign and Everton’s potential progression stands on a knife edge.

The Toffees may sit top of Group G having taken five points from three games, but Thursday’s meeting with Lille at Goodison Park is arguably a season-defining match.

Win and progression is all but assured as Roberto Martinez’s side would be guaranteed to sit at least three points clear at the top of the table with two games remaining.

But if they lose, Everton could find themselves a lowly third in the table and relying on results elsewhere to qualify.

For many reasons, Thursday appears to be a defining moment in Martinez’s reign on Merseyside – and it is almost certain that Everton’s fantastic full backs will have a key part to play in its outcome.

When asked how good Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman were ahead of Thursday’s clash, Martinez smiled and replied: '100 per cent, they are the best pair of full backs in England.

'In previous years, full-backs only had to defend – it was a bonus if they crossed the halfway line. But now they have to be able to defend one-on-one, and help offensively too.'

It is without a shadow of a doubt that Martinez has two real gems to prowl his flanks – Baines and Coleman are both competent in defence and exquisite going forward.

Yet, until Everton’s mini-revival in recent weeks, they were the lone bright sparks in a campaign in which Everton were jammed in first gear and struggling to find the clutch pedal.

Coleman has scored three goals for Everton so far this season, picking up one assist along the way 

Former Wigan defender Baines has grabbed an impressive eight assists in all competitions

The first season honeymoon at Goodison is well and truly over for Martinez and the Spaniard has found his second campaign a heck of a lot tougher.

Kick-off: Thursday, November 6, 8.05pm

TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm

Primarily the heart of his defence has been found wanting.

With 14 games played in all competitions Everton have leaked 22 goals – including 12 on their own patch in just three matches against Swansea City, Chelsea and Crystal Palace.

Unfortunately for the Toffees, Phil Jagielka has looked every bit his 32 years too often during those matches, frequently being beaten for pace or out-foxed by clever movement.

Antolin Alcaraz – although unfortunate with injuries – has never quite looked an Everton player since his switch from Wigan Athletic and, at 36, even Slyvain Distin is understandably now losing his seemingly endless powers of longevity.

And, just to compound Martinez’s problems, the extremely promising John Stones has found himself on the treatment table just when he was showing what a class performer he could become.

Martinez was beginning to build his whole side around the 20-year-old England international until an ankle injury cruelly robbed him of the versatile defender out until at least the New Year.

But he still has two very big reasons to be positive – and their names are Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman. For while Everton may have been conceding far more frequently than they would like this season, they are also scoring at a rate of two goals per game – a ratio helped tremendously by their marauding full backs.

In 15 appearances this season, Baines has scored twice and assisted on an incredible eight occasions.

Coleman, meanwhile, has bagged three goals and contributed an assist in 10 appearances.

However, the Irishman’s real importance to Everton can be highlighted by their results during his month-long absence between the middle of September through until October due to injury.

In the four games Coleman missed, Everton failed to win once and conceded seven times. Since his return against Aston Villa on October 18, the Toffees have won twice, drawn one and conceded just once.

Martinez’s assessment of Coleman and Baines as ‘the best pair of full backs in England’ may be contested by the likes of Manuel Pellegrini – who has Gael Clichy, Aleksandar Kolarov, Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta at his disposal at Manchester City – but few sides rely so heavily on players tasked with defending the flanks.

Everton’s success is based on their full backs having the freedom to roam up and down the touchlines as they please – and they will be the key to defining the success of the season.

Expectations have risen and a trophy is desperately craved by the Goodison faithful.

Supporters narrowly missed out on the Champions League last term having finished outside of the top four, but the Europa League could in fact be the Toffees’ gateway to taking on the continent's very best in the future.

For the first time ever, the winners of the Europa League will automatically qualify for the Champions League – either through the play-offs, or, a likely scenario in Everton's case, straight into the group stage should the victors in Europe's top competition gain entry via their league position.

Everton will be hoping to keep Liverpool-bound striker Divock Origi quiet at Goodison Park

With Everton having battled to a 0-0 draw at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy two weeks ago, the Toffees know they are capable of shutting out Liverpool’s on-loan Divock Origi and Co when Lille come to town.

But it is up the other end of the pitch where they must impress upon a side sitting a lowly 12th in Ligue 1 at Goodison on Thursday, live on ITV4 (8.05pm kick-off).

And, as Martinez will tell you, it is Everton’s top-class full backs who hold the key to Europa League success this season – both against Lille and hopefully beyond.

It is Martinez’s full backs who can march Everton through the gateway towards the promised land of the Champions League by leading the Toffees on the Road to Warsaw this season.
