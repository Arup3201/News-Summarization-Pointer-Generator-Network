Manchester City are one of the clubs chasing Ashley Cole, who confirmed at this week that he will be leaving Chelsea after eight years.

The 33-year-old left back, who retired from international duty with 107 England caps having been left out of Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad, is out of contract and attracting interest from Liverpool, Monaco and New York Red Bulls.

But Cole remains close to Manchester City Under-21 coach Patrick Vieira, with whom he played at Arsenal, and they connection between the two could sway Cole's decision.

Where next? Ashley Cole is resigned to leaving Chelsea this summer as his contract ends

On the move: The left back has spent eight years at Chelsea but looks set to leave this summer

Finished: Cole retired from international football having been left out of England's World Cup squad

City already have Gael Clichy and 
Aleksandar Kolarov at left back - but Cole's arrival would ease the 
pressure on their Champions League squad.

City
 have to include eight players which UEFA consider to be in 
'home-trained' in their reduced 21-man squad. If they replace Kolarov 
with Cole it would reduce the pressure on the squad as Cole qualifies as
 an 'association-trained' players and can help make up the eight-man 
quota.

Cole enjoyed eight 
years at Chelsea after leaving Arsenal in 2006 in what was a highly 
controversial move after Chelsea were found guilty by the Premier League
 of breaking their rules in meeting Cole prior to a transfer.

The
 33-year-old has won two European Championships, 107 England caps, three
 Premier League titles, seven FA Cups, a Champions League and Europa 
League trophy, one League Cup and three Community Shields.

He
 is keen to play on for at least another season and eight clubs have 
reportedly already expressed an interest in securing his services.

Cole tweeted on Monday night: 'I am weighing up my options for playing next season with my agent and sadly it does not look like Chelsea will be one of them.'

Happy days: Cole could be set for a return to Arsenal, who he left to join Chelsea

He added: 'Thank you Chelsea FC for 
making my eight years there a pleasure to work all the staff and 
players, we've been through a lot. And of course the fans, how do I 
start? I can only say thank you for giving the boys confidence to win 
some amazing trophies.

'This tweet is to the fans that have stood buy me through thick and thin, I will always have you in my heart.

'Now I'll be looking for another journey in my life. I hope it can be 
like my others - full of fun and of course WIN something.'

Manchester United does not look a likely option with Southampton starlet Luke Shaw seemingly bound for Old Trafford but new manager Louis Van Gaal may look to Cole if negotiations with Shaw are unsuccessful.

Arsene Wenger is in need of a replacement for injury prone Kieran Gibbs and inconsistent Nacho Monreal. Returning to Arsenal, where he spent nine years before leaving for Chelsea for higher wages and earning the nickname ‘Cashley Cole,’ would be a controversial move.

Uncertain future: John Terry earned a new contract, but Cole and Frank Lampard are yet to receive an offer

Meanwhile Brendan Rodgers could be 
keen to bring Cole to Anfield to solve his problem at left back, where 
he deployed Glen Johnson, Aly Cissokho, Mamadou Sakho and Jon Flanagan 
last season.

Cole has spoken
 in the past about the attractions of playing in Europe. When his 
representatives negotiated his latest deal last year, worth just under 
£200,000-per-week, they held tentative talks with Real Madrid, Paris 
Saint-Germain and Manchester United.

Real
 are still thought to be interested in an experienced player and 
consummate professional like Cole, while PSG have the money in the 
coffers to satisfy his wage demands.
