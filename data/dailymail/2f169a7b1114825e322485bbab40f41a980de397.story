Dionne Warwick was hospitalized for 'almost two weeks after she slipped and fell in her shower.'

The 74-year-old singer, who is the cousin of Whitney Houston and Bobbi Kristina Brown, had her own bathroom incident on January 24, exactly one week before 21-year-old Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive in a bathtub.

The five-time Grammy winner was released from a New Jersey hospital on Thursday following ankle surgery, according to a new report from TMZ.

Dionne 'was at her home in South Orange, New Jersey when she fell' and was 'taken by ambulance to a local hospital.'

The gossip site noted an eerie coincidence: 'The 911 call for Dionne came in at 10.19am on Saturday, January 24. The 911 call for Bobbi Kristina came in exactly a week later at 10.25am on January 31.'

On Friday, Dionne took to her Twitter account to thank fans for their continued support during the difficult time.

'On behalf of my family, I would like to thank you for all of your kind words. All in God's plan. - Dionne,' she wrote.

The only child of the late singer Whitney Houston - whose father is Bobbi Brown - has not been taken off life support or declared brain dead, a family source said on Thursday.

Few details about Bobbi Kristina's condition have been released. Her family has said she was fighting for her life after being rushed to a hospital in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell on January 31.

Police said they responded to Bobbi Kristina's home in reference to a drowning. Her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas found her unresponsive in the tub and performed CPR until help arrived, police said.

Houston, a six-time Grammy Award winner and actress who battled substance abuse, drowned in a hotel bathtub three years ago in Beverly Hills, California, on Feb. 11, 2012. Authorities said cocaine use and heart disease contributed to her death at age 48.

Her daughter is currently receiving treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to CNN and other media outlets. The hospital would not confirm she was a patient there, but the hospital in Roswell that initially provided treatment said she was no longer under its care.

'Though it seems the odds are against her, though doctors don't see any hope for change ... though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK,' Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram and Facebook on Thursday.
