Jeremy Hunt has performed a complete U-turn on the legislation regarding infant vaccinations, saying now that children young enough will be covered by the meningitis B vaccine

Babies could receive the new meningitis B vaccine as soon as this summer and it could also be extended  to teenagers.

In a Government U-turn, infants aged two months will be vaccinated on the NHS if costs with the manufacturer can be agreed.

And research will be carried out which could lead to teenagers also receiving the vaccine.

Britain has one of the highest meningitis B rates in the world – affecting on average 1,870 people each year.

The disease can kill within hours.

Children under five and teenagers are most at risk. It kills more under-fives than any other infectious disease in the UK.

The Department of Health’s U-turn on providing the vaccine on the NHS comes in the wake of intense pressure from charities and senior doctors on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

The vaccine, known as Bexsero and made by Novartis, is the first to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis.

But last July, the committee said it was not cost-effective ‘at any price’ and could not be recommended for use on the NHS.

Thousands of campaigners petitioned the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging them to ensure it was approved.

In October, the committee said it was considering new evidence and a range of views.

The vaccine was licensed for use in January last year and the committee figures suggest that since then, at least 200 people in Britain were killed by meningitis B or suffered serious after-effects.

Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health, said: ‘Infants under one year of age are most at risk of meningitis B and the number of cases peak at around five or six months of age.

Since the meningitis B vaccine was created last year at least 200 people in Britain were killed by meningitis B or suffered serious after-effects

‘With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most make a full recovery.

‘But it is fatal in about one in ten cases and can lead to long-term health problems such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties.

‘We will now be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible.

‘This would make the UK the first country in the world to implement a nationwide vaccination programme.’

Andrin Oswald, division head at Novartis Vaccines, said the company will work with the Department of Health to get the vaccine to babies as early as this summer.

‘At Novartis, it took us more than 20 years of hard work to get to this point,’ he said.

The joint committee has recommended infants are immunised from two months of age – having three jabs in total – and that there is a one-off catch-up programme for babies aged three and four months when it is introduced.

The committee has also recommended a pilot programme vaccinating teenagers to see whether it reduces the level of bacteria carried in the nose, which can trigger meningitis in this age group.

Campaigners claim that, in extreme cases, the cost of treating and supporting each survivor of meningitis is £3million.

Statistics show that between 2008 and 2012, £28million was paid in compensation to the families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis which GPs had not spotted.
