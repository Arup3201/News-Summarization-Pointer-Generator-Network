Estonian driver Ott Tanak was back in the Rally of Mexico on Saturday after his submerged Ford was fished out of a reservoir and rebuilt overnight.

Tanak's car rolled down a steep embankment and plunged into deep water on Friday's second leg of the Guanajuato-based rally, remaining sunk for 10 hours.

'As soon as we opened the doors the car was gone in just a few seconds,' the M-Sport driver had said after he and co-driver Raigo Moelder, who managed to retrieve his pace notes, had scrambled free.

The Ford rally car flipped into the deep water with both drivers still inside the vehicle 

'I also had a problem with my intercom wire because it didn't come loose and was dragging me under the water. We were really lucky.'

After finally pulling the car out, M-Sport drained the engine and replaced the gearbox, fuel tank, turbo, electronic components and a host of other parts.

'This is something that we have never seen before,' Tanak said.

'The car has been gone all day, submerged at the bottom of a lake, full of water, and the team had to do a full rebuild in just three hours.' 

Luckily for Tanak and Molder the car turned back the right way and they were able to open the doors

The drivers managed to swim away from the wreckage as the car began to sink deeper into the water

Stage three in Mexico has seen a number of brutal crashes with Kris Meeke and Paul Nagle involved in a collision with the embankment before coming to a halt. 

Polish duo Robert Kubica and Maciek Szczepaniak managed to head off the road and crash straight into a tree - causing the car to flip.

While Belgians Thierry Neuville and Nicolas Gilsoul lost control on a tight corner before crashing into a ditch and needing locals to help shift the vehicle.
