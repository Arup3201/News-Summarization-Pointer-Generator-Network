Arsenal superstars were put through their paces during a final training session before they head to France in a bid to rescue their Champions League hopes in their last 16 return leg clash with Monaco.

The Gunners trail the Ligue 1 side 3-1 after a disastrous first leg capitulation at the Emirates on February 25, but the team carried determined expressions on their faces as they trained at London Colney on Monday. 

World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has called on his team-mates to overturn the two-goal deficit by scoring three at the Stade Louis II - a feat that has not been managed by any other team in the last 42 months.

The stylish midfielder has vowed to fight from the first minute until the last to keep the Premier League side in the competition, but appreciates the importance of scoring early on Tuesday night. 

Speaking to the club's official website, Ozil said: 'It's very important to score early, but we will remain patient. We want to fight and battle from the first minute until the last.

'This is a match that we are determined to win. We have to score three goals and our aim is to do just that while remaining tight in defence.

'If we play as we are capable of doing in Monaco, I still believe that we have a real chance to progress.

'We want to disrupt their rhythm and try to score as early as possible. It's going to be difficult to score three times because they have defended well in the tournament so far, but if you look at our past matches and the way we played against Manchester United last week, I think there's a chance we can still progress.

'We have to believe in ourselves. When you believe in yourselves, a positive energy grows that you can achieve your aims. In football, things that may look unlikely can happen.

'I know that if we believe in ourselves and utilise our potential, we can still go through.'

Meanwhile, former Monaco and Tottenham star Glenn Hoddle has predicted a 'difficult' evening for Arsenal.

The former England manager, who was part of the Monaco side that won the league title under Wenger in 1988, is doubtful that Arsenal will be able to score three goals at the Stade Louis II.

Speaking to TV station beIN SPORTS, Hoddle said: 'It will be an emotional game for Arsene Wenger, to return here. Difficult.

'Arsenal are playing very well now, they're quick and technical, but AS Monaco are tough defensively.'
