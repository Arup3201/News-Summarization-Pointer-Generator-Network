A young boy with a huge right foot has baffled hundreds of doctors who have no idea how to treat his condition.

Verdant Joshi's limb measures a shocking 11 inches and weighs 12lbs (5.4 kg) - the same as a bowling ball or a sack of potatoes.

The four-year-old, from Gujarat, western India, has been bullied all his life because of his conditiom- although he can walk and run normally.

Many doctors have suggested the foot should be amputated, while others say the condition is not life-threatening.

Verdant Joshi, four, was born with a giant right leg and a foot that now measures 11 inches and weighs 12lbs (5.4kg), the same as a bowling ball or sack of potatoes

He has been examined by hundreds of doctors from India and abroad, who have suggested he could be suffering from conditions ranging from water retention to a hormone imbalance. However none have been able to recommend treatment

Many doctors have suggested his right leg should be amputated, but as he can run and walk normally, his father Dilip Joshi,  wants to avoid this as it would Verdant for life

Now, his father is desperate for a doctor in some corner of the world to treat his son's big foot so he can avoid amputation, which would disable him for the rest of his life.

Verdant said his foot means he is ostracised from other children, who make fun of him.

He said: 'Children laugh at me for not running fast.

'They don't ask me to play cricket or football, even if I tell them I can run. I want to go to school but teachers have told my father I can't go.'

Instead, Verdant is confined to his two-room house where he plays with his mother Jayshree Joshi, 26, and his one-year-old sister Vrisha.

His desperate parents have taken him to more than 100 doctors over the last four years but most have been baffled by his condition.

Despite examining his foot several times and taking blood, sweat and saliva samples they have failed to diagnose the problem.

Visiting doctors from America, Mumbai, Udaipur and Chennai have even examined Vedant but none could diagnose his condition.

His father Dilip Kumar Joshi, 30, said: 'I've tried every field of medical science, from homeopath, allopath, orthopedic specialists, bone specialists and skin specialists but to no avail. They're all baffled.'

Dilip added: 'Doctors from America couldn't even tell us what's wrong. Some doctors have told us his hormones are imbalanced and others said the blood doesn't flow properly and another said it's water retention.

But they all fail to tell us what we can do about it.'

As Verdant cannot go to school, he has to stay at home with his father Dilip, 30, mother Jayshree, 26, and his one-year-old sister Vrisha

Verdant's father Dilip said he is 'terrified' his son's foot will keep growing like a balloon, and worries about what will happen in future. 'If I had known he would be born with a deformed leg I would have aborted the baby. It is a punishment for any parent to helplessly watch their child suffer'

Vedant's big foot keeps growing with age and height so it is likely his foot will continue to grow to shocking proportions.

'I'm terrified his foot will continue to grow and burst like a balloon,' he added.

Vedant doesn't feel any pain in his leg or foot and can walk, run, cross his legs and even sit on a bike without any support but many doctors have suggested amputating the leg.

'I've been told amputation is the only option,' his father, Mr Joshi, said.

'But if I cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever, unable to walk. At least he's mobile right now.'

Mr Joshi, who works as an astrologer earning £150 a month by reading horoscopes and organizing purifying rituals at birthdays and weddings, has spent £10,000 in four years meeting doctors.

Dr Manibhai Patel, MBBS who runs a private clinic in Deesa, Gujarat, believes his condition is not curable, but equally, is not life-threatening.

'During my 35 year career I have not seen any patient like Vedant.

His foot seems to be a genetic disease but I cannot ascertain the real cause so I cannot recommend any medicine or even surgery. But I do not believe it's life threatening.'

A British woman called Mandy Sellers, 39, from Lancashire, was born with abnormally large legs, which continued to grow to disproportionate sizes.

She was finally diagnosed with the congenital disorder Proteus Syndrome for which there is no known cure. It is thought Vedant could be suffering the same condition.

Mrs Joshi was told during her pregnancy that her fetus was a healthy child but Vedant's right leg was abnormally large at birth.

Mr Joshi said: 'If I had known he would be born with a deformed leg I would have aborted the baby. It is a punishment for any parent to helplessly watch their child suffer.

Verdant finds it difficult to find trousers and shoes that fit. His father has  shoes specially made from the local cobblers, which are sewn out of  old jeans

Mr Joshi said he hopes to find a specialist somewhere in the world who can help his son, to avoid amputation. 'If I cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever, unable to walk. At least he's mobile right now'

'People get scared of him, some even ask if he has a plastic leg and then he starts crying. It's very sad for him and for us to watch.'

Mrs Joshi, who gave birth to her second child, a healthy daughter, in September 2013, added: 'Sometimes Vedant comes to me and cries and says he has a deformed foot because he'd committed a sin in his past life.

'His words tear me apart. I don't have any explanation for him, except keep his faith in God.'

Although Vedant doesn't face any obstacles in his daily life, he has trouble finding shoes and trousers to fit.

Mr Joshi said: 'It's extremely difficult to find shoes that he can slip his foot into. Earlier we used to buy two pairs of shoes of different sizes and made it fit.

'But two years ago his leg grew so big that no shoe fits. I have to order made to measure shoes from the cobbler which he makes from my old jeans.'

Mr Joshi is now hoping to raise awareness to his son's foot, so a specialist may recognize the condition and be able to treat it.
