Pantless: Natalie Delgado, 20, was driving the wrong way along the Interstate when she was stopped by police

A woman who was pulled over by police for driving the wrong way down a road was not wearing any pants.

Natalie Delgado, 20, was stopped by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper on suspicion of drink driving around 2.45am on the Interstate 595 near Davie.

She was 'traveling in the wrong direction and on the wrong side of the roadway' when she was stopped and got out of the car without her pants on, the trooper's arrest report said.

It added: 'The [defendant] was not wearing her pants. She reached behind the driver's seat to get her pants. She put her pants on.'

The report said she denied having drunk anything and said she was heading home from her work in a bar.

She later admitted she had had a shot of tequila. The trooper noted she smelled of alcohol and struggled to touch heel to toe in a sobriety test, the Sun Sentinel reported.

In a video from court published by the newspaper, Broward County Judge John 'Jay' Hurley criticised the underage drinker, who had already been stopped of suspicion of DUI in February.

He said: 'You've been arrested for DUI twice now … clearly you didn't learn from 
that, and now you're out drinking tequila and driving again and not 
wearing pants. The court's very concerned, ma'am. You're 
out of control.'

The judge added: 'Ma'am, when you're arrested for DUI and you're not wearing pants, there 
sometimes is a connection between unusual behavior — not wearing your 
clothes — and the level of intoxication.

'The court 
believes you're a danger not only to yourself, but everyone else in the 
community. You're not even supposed to be drinking.'

He set the bond for Delgado, from Pompano Beach, at $25,000.
