It was a hairy escape for one Washington bus passenger whose former friend tried to set her locks on fire.

CCTV footage shows a grinning Robin Myers, 56, reaching into her pocket, pulling out a lighter and holding it to the hair of a woman sitting in front of her.

A man sitting near Myers saw what happened and put out the flames.

KOMO News reported the bizarre assault unfolded about 8.30am Monday while the Community Transit bus was traveling in the 15200 block of Smokey Point Boulevard, Marysville.

The unknown victim's friend reported the incident to the bus driver who pulled over before police arrived.

According to charges filed in Snohomish County Superior Court, deputies found two BIC lighters and a 
can of hairspray in Myers' purse.

The Darrington woman allegedly told police the whole thing was an accident and that she used to be friends with the victim.

Police said the male passenger's quick thinking saved the victim from injury.

Myers has been charged with assault and banned from riding Community Transit buses.

Community Transit spokesman Martin Mungui said he often hears reports of strange things happening on buses.

'We do transport 40,000 people a day, so that’s a lot of people in close quarters,' he told FOX 30 JAX.  'But I’ve never heard of someone lighting someone else’s hair on fire.'
