Erin Kathleen Queen, 27, had sex with her 17-year-old student and gave him vodka in 2012

A 27-year-old teacher from Sand Springs, Oklahoma who was charged with raping her 17-year-old student back in 2012 was given just a 'slap on the wrist last week.'Erin Kathleen Queen's charges were dismissed last week and she was given three years probation, a $600 fine, and an order to surrender her teacher's license after confessing to another crime related contributing to delinquency of a minor.Shasta and Adam Belty, the boy's parents, are outraged and want to rally to change Oklahoma State law, reports Tulsa World. Queen, a former English teacher at Charles Page High School was arrested on March 17 in 2012 after the 17-year-old's parents were worried about where their son might be.After probing him, the boy's parents discovered he was at the Candlewood Suites near 71st Street and Mingo Road at 5:30 AM.Belty said she discovered the inappropriate relationship with one phone call to her son. 'He was reluctant to tell me but then he told me he was with Ms. Queen, Erin Queen. And I thought that name sounds familiar. And he said mom, 'It's my 5th hour English teacher.'. And I died as a parent, said Belty, who is perplexed as to how the woman who raped her son is allowed to roam free.Back in 2012 Queen was booked into Tulsa Jail on a first degree rape complaint and she was later charged with second degree rape and a misdemeanor charge causing delinquency of a minor. The misdemeanor was related to allegations that she'd given the boy vodka.

Queen's charges were dismissed when she pleaded guilty to a new case contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

'It’s very frustrating to us that she basically got a slap on the wrist,' Shasta Belty told Tulsa World.

'I cussed. I cried. I totally disagreed with it,' Shasta said.

'(Prosecutor Amanda Self) was under the impression that we were OK with a conviction as long as she never taught again. Well, we were OK with a conviction – of the second-degree rape … or something that represents the sexual misconduct.'

According to Title 21, Section 1115 of the Oklahoma Statutes, sex may be considered rape if '...the victim is at least sixteen (16) years of age and is less than eighteen (18) years of age and is a student, or under the legal custody or supervision of any public or private elementary or secondary school, junior high or high school, or public vocational school, and engages in sexual intercourse with a person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and is an employee of the same school system.'

The Beltys believe that Queen was given a lighter treatment because she is a woman, reports ABC.
