Google has lifted the lid on some of their new green methods for handling the billions of emails they deal with each and every day.

And in typical Google feel-good fashion, they decided to demonstrate their methods in a cute animation full of whimsical imagery, showing our emails bouncing through cables as cats play on rooftops and cars trundle along the road.

'The Story of Send', as Google terms it, takes us on a journey which starts when your email - or Gmail, assuming you are using Google's email system - bounces out of your laptop, and ends when the email arrives on the recipient's smartphone.

Although the animation is a colourful land where Google employees skate through the data banks and listen to their music through their headphones, clicking on any of the various Play buttons that dot the landscape lead into very serious documentaries about how Google reduces their power needs and uses green technology to reduce the search engine's impact on the environment.

Along the way, we also learn some fascinating facts about their data farm - for instance employees work in Hawaiian shirts and shorts rather than waste energy on air-conditioning the giant vaults containing thousands of hard drives, or how 100 Google searches equals the amount of power used to light a light-bulb for 28 minutes.

Some of the tidbits revealed by Google include how the company keeps its data centres - those vast warehouses full of hard-drives storing Google's colossal amounts of data - at a warm 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26C), rather than spend a lot of energy and money keeping air-conditioning the building.

Instead, the company simply asks its workers to wear shorts to work.

Also, the company says that: 'Since 2007, we’ve recycled enough servers to avoid buying over 90,000 replacement machines. We always look for ways to reuse what we have, and when we can’t, we completely erase any data components and resell them.

'We’re proud that we recycle 100% of the electronic equipment that leaves our data centers.'

Other little facts that appear on the animation include how a user streaming three days of YouTube uses the equivalent energy it takes to manufacture, package and deliver one DVD, and how using 100 searches uses the same amount of energy as using a 60W light bulb for 28 minutes.

And, if you are scared of sending private emails, or using 'cloud' services, whereby companies like Google, Microsoft or DropBox look after your data and can stream it to multiple devices, Google wants you to know there are some real-world security options built into their data farms.

The company says: 'We understand the importance of keeping your personal data secure. That’s why we protect your message with a wide range of security measures. Security cameras, iris scans and fingerprint scans at our data centers are just a few of the measures we take to secure and protect your information.'

The company also states they use renewable energy for more than 30% of our operations.

Although Google may be simply trying to score some 'green' points, it is fascinating to see the journey of a Gmail from start to finish - and as Google themselves say: 'This whole trip took just seconds and happens billions of times a day.'
