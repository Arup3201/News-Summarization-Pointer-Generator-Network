Happy New Year and 2015 promises to be an exciting year for rugby with the Rugby World Cup taking place in England in September and October. But the year starts, in Scotland, with the return leg of the 1872 Cup on Friday at Murrayfield and my New Year wish is that we get a better game than we had last week at Scotstoun.

But before I get to the rugby, I really think this game is a missed opportunity. I am told they are expecting a crowd of 12,000 to 14,000 which is way above Edinburgh’s average home attendance. But why are we not trying to fill Murrayfield? Harlequins filled Twickenham’s 82,000 seats last week for their match against Northampton, Leinster move the Munster game to the Aviva and get 50,000 and Saracens have had 90,000 in Wembley. 

They have all done this by getting two things right, first marketing the game properly and second, get the ticket prices right. Harlequins titled their game last week ‘Big Game 7’ and by doing this they created a product that they priced right and sold the product using social media as a way to attract new fans. They put on entertainment which meant the whole experience was one that will entice some of the first-timers to come back to another game.

Scottish Rugby has marketed this game  in the usual way they always market the game and, as a result, they will get the usual crowd. This was a great opportunity to try something different as everyone is looking for something to do by the 2nd January. I would love to have seen an attempt made to fill Murrayfield and try and attract the latent support for rugby that exists in Edinburgh. Remember, 38,000 fans came to Murrayfield to see Edinburgh play Toulouse in the Heineken Cup a few years ago so the support is there, it just needs to be attracted in. Make the tickets £10 for adults and kids free, bombard social media and other advertising mediums with a campaign to ‘Fill Murrayfield, and get people talking about the game. 

As usual at this time of the year, I have been at many social gatherings yet nobody was talking about the game at Murrayfield which is a shame. Aim for 60,000 and if you only get 40,000 on first attempt, make sure the experience is such that we fill it the following year. There is an element of a feel-good factor within Scottish Rugby with Glasgow doing so well and Scotland having a promising Autumn Series so this was the time to try something different. None of this is ground breaking, it is what many clubs have done with success for a number of years and I hope we have a crack at this next year.

If we do want a bigger crowd to attend these matches, the quality of rugby on offer needs to be better than we saw in the first leg and I think it will be on Friday. The big Murrayfield pitch and the quality of the new pitch should allow this to happen but the attitude of both teams needs to be better than last week. Both teams seemed only concerned with stopping the opposition playing and this played right into Edinburgh’s hands.

They have made themselves hard to play against with being strong in defence and very competitive in the tackle area. They lack creativity and have picked Greg Tonks at stand off when I felt they looked more dangerous when he was moved to full back last week. But they still have quality players in Matt Scott, Dave Denton and Ross Ford and these guys will be desperate to put one over the team that have dominated the Scottish game for a number of years now.

Glasgow have the better players and, if they get their off-loading game going which allows their dangerous runners to find space, they will cause Edinburgh all sorts of problems. The selection of Tyrone Holmes is interesting as he is a specialist open side which would suggest Glasgow intend to play a faster and wider game than last week. This may have been decided for them with Rob Harley’ s injury but Holmes’ battle with Roddy Grant at the breakdown will be key.

Glasgow have too much quality for Edinburgh in the starting team as well as the bench where they have the luxury of bringing on two Lions in Euan Murray and Stuart Hogg so I expect Glasgow to win. If they get their attitude and execution right they could even get the bonus point win as well as the 1872 Cup for another year.
