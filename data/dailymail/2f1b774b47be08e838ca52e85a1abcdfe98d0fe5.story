The BBC must reflect a wider range of views from across the country, the director-general admitted yesterday.

Facing accusations of left-wing bias in its news coverage of a range of recent issues, Tony Hall admitted the corporation could have ‘responded quicker’ to some recent criticisms of bias and said it was ‘bound’ to get some  things wrong.

He added: ‘We should avoid groupthink ... We should look to a range of voices and examples around the UK.’

Grilling: BBC Director-General Tony Hall answered questions in front of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on Tuesday

Lord Hall was grilled by MPs on the culture, media and sport committee, on a string of issues including the  severance pay scandal and the failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which wasted £100million.

Appearing alongside him, BBC chairman Chris Patten admitted the corporation’s founder Lord Reith would be ‘turning in his grave’ at the revelations, and said the DMI fiasco was a ‘horror story’.

Some of the most strident criticism came from Tory MP Philip Davies, who said the BBC was guilty of  imbalance in its recent coverage of political events such as welfare reform and benefits tourism.

Mr Davies claimed BBC employees were naturally inclined to be left-wing, despite working for a supposedly impartial organisation. 

Insistent: Lord Hall said told the committee the BBC were 'always searching for impartiality'

In a sarcastic aside, Mr Davies said Lord Hall had increased the number of left-wing employees at the BBC by appointing Blairites such as ex-Labour minister James Purnell and former spin doctor Godric Smith to senior management positions.

Lord Hall conceded it was curious that the BBC buys more copies of  the left-leaning Guardian than any other newspaper.

And he appeared to concede the BBC had made a mistake in describing the Government’s housing benefit reforms as a ‘bedroom tax’, which Mr Davies said was ‘clearly a political term’.

The director-general said: ‘I absolutely want to get the terminology right ... We’ve got to find ways of describing controversial issues and I think you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t.’

‘Thank God we listened and said let’s change what we’re doing. Maybe we should have responded quicker but we responded.’

Lord Hall insisted: ‘We are always searching after impartiality, new  perspectives, new views. When we get things wrong, and we are bound to, let’s not keep looking over our shoulder.

‘Let’s make decisions on the basis we should get things right. But when we get things wrong, and we are bound to, we should admit it and move on.’

He added: ‘I also think we should do more on Europe. It’s a vital issue and reporting on Europe from Europe to the UK should be an important part of what we do.’

Lord Patten said only £3.8million of the £369million paid to departing staff over the past eight years was in excess of the BBC’s contractual obligations, and only that amount could be considered ‘waste’. It was just half the cost of broadcasting a Premier League football match, he added.
