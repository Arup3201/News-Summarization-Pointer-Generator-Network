Busted: Katie Wilson, 19, was arrested after parading through Tesco naked

A teenager paraded naked through a Tesco store and karate-kicked a policeman in the face after taking the £10 legal high Benzo Fury, a court heard yesterday.

Katie Wilson, 19, spoke of her shame after she went on the rampage in the middle of the day in the supermarket.

The teenager was so out of control when she went on a 'terrifying trip' she was mistaken for a heroin addict by police called to the store in Bourne, Lincolnshire.

She kicked an officer in the face barefoot and broke the wing mirror off a patrol car as officers battled to arrest her.

Controversial party drug Benzo Fury gives users a high similar to ecstasy and was blamed for
the death of Alex Herriot, 19, at the RockNess festival in Scotland last weekend.

Katie was fined £200 and given a one-year
conditional discharge after she admitted outraging public decency and 
criminal damage at Grantham Magistrates Court on Monday.

Katie, a shop assistant from Deeping St James, Lincolnshire, urged others not to take the drug as she recalled the incident yesterday.

'I have learnt my lesson. If anything this has been the making of me - it was the real wake-up call I needed,' she said.

'I'm so embarrassed about it, I'm just horrified that it made me become something I'm not. 

'I was an absolute mess - I trashed my
friend's flat and then I just walked out of the flat stumbled up the 
road and into the store.

'I was parading through the Tesco aisles like a catwalk diva. I was a disgrace and it was a real terrifying trip.

'I had chewed a pen so it looked like I
had black teeth and I had drawings all over my body. The police thought
I was a heroin addict.  

'But I'm really a decent girl - I drive a BMW and I work hard, it really wasn't me.

Benzo Fury is just the latest 'legal high' to appear on the market.

The drugs - which are not banned and are sold as not fit for human consumption produce a similar effect to banned substances.

But they have a different molecular structure to banned substances so are not illegal under anti-drugs legislation.

There are a large number of 'legal highs' - some are known by their brand/product name.

Although the authorities move to ban new highs such as mephedrone or 'meow meow', new variants of the drug are created so quickly they are fighting a losing battle.

Knowing that these substances are legal makes them very tempting for teenagers to try - even though they are completely unregulated and potentially harmful.

Benzo Fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high. It induces feelings of empathy similar to Class  A drug ecstasy.

It is also a stimulant and it's side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia.

Controversial 'legal highs' such as Benzo Fury and Ivory Wave are manufactured in laboratories in the Far East and eastern Europe.

'I haven't been out for about a month 
now and I'm really into my fitness - I'm a changed girl and I would 
advise other people to stay away from the drug.

'It is very dangerous and it can do you real damage - I don't want others to make the same mistake I did.'

The court heard Katie walked into the Tesco store just after midday in front of stunned shoppers on May 23.

Daniel Paulson, prosecuting, said: 'She was then taken to a back office where something was found for her to wear.

'Police then attended and placed Miss Wilson under arrest.'

However, Wilson refused to leave quietly and attacked the officer and a car.

Mr Paulson added: 'She admitted the offences in interview. She said she had taken legal drugs which caused her to act in the way she did.'

Rob Arthur, defending, told the court: 'The fact she went out to Tesco in Bourne naked shows the mental state she was in.

'These experiences mean she will never risk taking such substances again. This is clearly a day Miss Wilson would like to put out of her memory if she could.

'I don't think she could be any more apologetic to the officer in relation to her behaviour that day.'

Chairman of the bench Jo Johnson told her: 'I hope you have learnt your lesson.'
