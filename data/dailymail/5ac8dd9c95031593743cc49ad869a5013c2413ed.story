This is the moment a sailor had to be rescued in rough seas after he capsized his dinghy - thirty times.

The man was sailing in fast moving tides and force six winds when he got into difficulty in the Lee Bay area, off the Bristol Channel.

Two RNLI lifeboat crews from Ilfracombe, Devon, found the man in the water about a mile from the shore clinging to his overturned dinghy and took him to safety - and then went back for the dinghy.

Andrew Bengey, volunteer coxswain of Ilfracombe RNLI, said: 'The man was visibly shaken by his ordeal.

'He told our crew that he believed he had capsized about 30 times before we arrived, and was very pleased to see the lifeboat.

'He was certain we had saved his life, but the fact that he was wearing a buoyancy aid was definitely a major factor.'

The small dinghy and sail were brought back to Ilfracombe Harbour.
