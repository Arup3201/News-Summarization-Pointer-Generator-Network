Madonna may have decided to abandon her own undergraduate education in favor of focusing on her then-burgeoning music career, but that hasn't stopped her from offering some sage advice to her Lourdes, who is currently a college freshman.

During an interview with the Today show's Carson Daly, the 56-year-old singer, whose daughter is currently enrolled at the University of Michigan, Madonna's alma mater, revealed that she gave the teenager three key pieces of advice, before she started at college.

'Try to do everything in moderation,' she said of the wisdom she imparted to Lourdes, 18, 'Try not to kill all your brain cells. And try to go to class.'

Everything in moderation: Madonna, 56, revealed to the Today show's Carson Daly that she offered her daughter Lourdes three pieces of advice before she left for college 

Worry: The chart-topper admitted that she is still concerned about her daughter's well being 

And while to many, Madonna is a globally-successful super star, she added that - when it comes to her daughter - she worried and frets just like any other mother. 

'I'm very, you know, worried,' she told father-of-three Carson. 

'[I always ask her]: "Are you OK? Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating right?" 

'You know, I set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil. I was worried about the fact that she didn't have enough towels, Q-tips, you know.' 

But, despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter, who is following in her mother's footsteps by studying performing arts, it doesn't look like Madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if Lourdes has anything to do with it. 

Colleagues: Madonna and Lourdes have worked together in the past, collaborating on their Material Girl clothing line, which is a joint venture 

Up and comer: Lourdes, now 18, pictured in February 2008 (L) and December 2009 (R), is used to sharing the spotlight with her famous mother, and often attends events alongside the popstar 

Family ties: Madonna now has four children (from left to right) - David, nine, Lourdes, Mercy, nine, and Rocco, 14

'I'm not allowed at [football] games,” she admitted. 'You think my daughter wants me at a game?'

Luckily, the chart-topper isn't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter's college activities. 

The mother-of-four will release her 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, tomorrow, three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online.

And although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both 'excited' and 'nervous' - Madonna admitted that she is still 'frustrated' by the whole incident.  

'I mean, it's a process,' she said. 

'Music is really personal to me. A lot of the stuff is out there that I had no intention of ever finishing. They're, like, scribbles on a pad. You know what I mean? It's unspeakably embarrassing.'
