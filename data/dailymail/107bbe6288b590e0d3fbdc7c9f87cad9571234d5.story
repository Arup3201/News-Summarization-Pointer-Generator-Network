A Memphis woman has been charged with elder abuse and neglect after the mother that lived with her was found to have injuries so serious her legs were rotting away.

The mother, 77-year-old Betty Cleveland, has now died in hospital.

Rose Fayne, who was arrested over the incident, initially called an elderly persons service, Crossroads Hospice, to assist her in caring for Cleveland.

However when Crossroads arrived and saw the state that Cleveland was in, they called for an ambulance and the police, according to KTLA 5 News.
