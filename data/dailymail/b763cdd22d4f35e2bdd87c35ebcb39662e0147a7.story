Relatives of soldiers killed while patrolling in Snatch Land Rovers have won the right to sue the Government for compensation.

Dozens of servicemen and women have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan while patrolling in the Land Rovers - grimly dubbed ‘mobile coffins’ by soldiers.

Families of several servicemen are now claiming damages over the deaths - claiming the Ministry of Defence put soldiers’ lives at risk by ordering them to patrol in the vehicles, which offered practically no protection against roadside bombs.

They claim that proper equipment would have prevented the deaths.

Yesterday Judges at the Court of Appeal in London ruled that the families could sue the Government for negligence - saying the Ministry of Defence had a duty of care over its personnel even when they were on the battlefield.

Lawyers representing the families hailed the decision as a landmark ruling.

The decision opens the door for civil action which could leave defence chiefs with a multi-million pound bill for damages.

Last night, a senior MP warned the ruling would have far-reaching consequences for generals making decisions on the battlefield.

And campaigners against secret courts warned Government proposals to expand secrecy in the justice system could mean such cases are hidden from public view in future.

The legal action was brought following the deaths of a number of British soldiers following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Private Phillip Hewett, 21, of Tamworth, died in July 2005 when his lightly armoured Snatch Land Rover was blown up.

Similar explosions claimed the lives of Private Lee Ellis, 23, of Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, in February 2006, and Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath, 22, of Romford, Essex, in August 2007.

Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, of Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, died in a ‘friendly fire’ incident in March 2003 when his Challenger 2 tank was hit by another.

Soldiers Dan Twiddy, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and Andy Julien, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, were badly hurt in the incident.

Pte Hewett’s mother Sue Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire accused defence chiefs of having a ‘despicable’ attitude.

She summed it up as: ‘They are Action Men. If you break them, just bury them.

‘But they are not just Action Men. People need to make a stand.’

The MoD argued that decisions about battlefield equipment were for politicians and military commanders.

Following a hearing in London in June Lord Neuberger, Lord Justice Moses and Lord Justice Rimer ruled in favour of the families, who argued the MoD had failed to provide armoured vehicles or equipment which could have saved lives.

Shubhaa Srinivasan, a partner with law firm Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘We maintain that the MoD’s position has been morally and legally indefensible, as they owe a duty of care to those who fight on behalf of this country.

‘British troops should at the very least have adequate equipment and training, ranging from the very basic such as GPS devices, to sophisticated satellite tracker systems, which the Americans had available to them.

‘It seems incredible that it was often left up to soldiers themselves to buy this equipment as they felt compelled to, so as to better protect their own lives and the lives of those they were responsible for.'

James Arbuthnot, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio 4: ‘It’s not just that the MoD is now going to owe a duty of care in relation to all the equipment procurement decisions it makes, but also in relation to everything that an officer or a soldier does actually in the course of battle.

‘I think the MoD had rather relied until now on the idea that if you decide to be a soldier, then you take with that decision the risks that naturally come with it - you put yourself in harm’s way with your eyes open.

‘That argument is really going to be much reduced in strength now, so the MoD is going to have to set out an entirely new set of training to work out what the consequences of this decision are going to be.’

Clare Algar, executive director of campaign group Reprieve, said: ‘The sweeping powers which the secret courts Bill grants the Government will make it near impossible to hold ministers to account for wrongdoing in a wide range of cases.

‘Those in which service personnel and their families have suffered as a result of state negligence is one example.

‘The Bill would in future give ministers the power to push this into a secret court by claiming matters of national security are involved.

An MoD spokesman said later: ‘Our thoughts and concerns remain with those that were injured and the families of those that sadly lost their lives.

‘We are considering the judgment by the Court of Appeal and as this is likely to be subject to further legal action it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’
