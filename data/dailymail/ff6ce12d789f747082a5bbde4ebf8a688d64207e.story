It would be the biggest airport in the world.

Jutting out into the Thames Estuary, it would serve 150million passengers a year – more than twice as many as Heathrow – and operate 24 hours a day.

This is Thames Hub, the astonishing £50billion vision to solve London’s aviation crisis.

Proposal: The estuary airport would be a transport hub with trains able to speed passengers all over Europe and Britain after they land

Yesterday, plans were unveiled for the four-runway airport on a sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain, in Kent.

Designed by architect Lord Norman 
Foster – who created the new Wembley Stadium – the airport would be a 
modern-day feat of British engineering built on reclaimed marshland. It 
would include the UK’s busiest railway station, handling 300,000 
passengers a day.

Planes would fly in from the 
north-east, primarily over water, greatly reducing the number of homes 
that would be affected by aircraft noise.

With the Government having admitted 
in August that London’s main airports will reach bursting point in 2030 –
 and a third runway at Heathrow  having been ruled out – backers of 
Thames Hub insist it offers a splendid solution.

But they have yet to convince everyone, especially people living in the area.

Councillor Rodney Chambers, leader of
 Medway Council in Kent, said: ‘The Isle of Grain is home to one of the 
world’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals, with a fifth of the 
UK’s gas supply offloaded by container ships and stored there.

‘We have looked at Lord Foster’s plan
 and he appears to want to place his fantasy Isle of Grain airport on 
top of the LNG plant and a power station. It beggars belief.’

Lord Foster said: ‘We need to 
recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century 
forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy 
infrastructure in Britain for this century and beyond. We can do it 
here.’

The airport’s backers claim that if 
the Government supports the scheme, sovereign wealth funds and wealthy 
foreign investors will stump up the cash to make it a reality.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson,  
yesterday declared his support for the plans, despite them rivalling his
 own vision for a ‘floating’ airport in the Thames Estuary.

A spokesman said: ‘He is delighted 
that a distinguished figure like Lord Foster agrees that the answer to 
Britain’s aviation needs lie in the [Thames] estuary.’

Danger: Medway Council say mixing the Liquefied Natural Gas import facility on the Isle of Grain, pictured, with a new airport would be a recipe for disaster

Lethal: The liquid gas for the area comes via the container port at the Isle of Grain, which protesters also say makes the area the wrong choice for an airport

Rival to Mayor's 'Boris Island' plan, it would run 24 hours a day and be more than twice as busy as Heathrow

A railway station to be built under the new airport would be the UK's busiest, handling 300,000 arrivals and departures a day

Critics say nearby gas storage and container port mean it is the 'daftest ever' airport plan for the area as results of a crash would be explosive
