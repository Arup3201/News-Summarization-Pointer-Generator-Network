The husband of a San Jose city councilwoman was videotaped trashing lawn signs from her competitor’s election campaign.

The escalation to alleged violence is the latest in an increasingly tense city council race between incumbent Rose Herrera and challenger Jimmy Nguyen.

Ms Herrera’s husband, Matt Wahlin, has now filed an assault and battery report claiming that two Nguyen supporters attacked him Monday night while he was throwing away some Nguyen posters.

‘I was going around the corner and I was blindsided and knocked to the ground by at least one person,’ Mr Wahlin said at a Tuesday morning press conference.

The men in question reportedly shined a bright light in Wahlin’s eyes and videotaped the incident.

Apparently that was not the first time that the two intrepid Nguyen supporters caught Wahlin on tape, as they said that they have video of him removing signs from neighbor’s lawns.

‘There's no excuse for stealing signs of a political opponent, and this win-at-all costs mentality is not healthy for our community,’ Dusin DeRollo, one of the Nguyen supporters involved in the incident, told the San Jose Mercury News.

Mr Wahlin has since admitted that he 
removed lawn signs that he claimed were illegally placed on his own 
property and on public space which goes against the city code.

‘This had occurred several times over the past few nights. Matt removed the signs from our property and took them to a public garbage bin to dispose of them,’ his wife’s campaign spokesman said in a press statement.

While the tape, which has not been released publicly, does not show which specific houses Mr Wahlin allegedly took the lawn signs from, his neighbors have noted a distinct pattern.

‘I've lost at least five signs,’ said Nguyen supporter Tina Cortese, who lives directly across the street from Herrera and Wahlin.

‘The only thing I suspect is that it's someone supporting her,’ she told local station KTVU.
