England is the only country in the UK that still 'taxes' for medication

The ‘outdated and iniquitous’ NHS prescription charge should be scrapped, a GP has said.

England remains the only country in the UK still stumping up for the ‘tax’ on medicines.

The latest figures for 2012 show that 80 per cent of those aged 18 to 59 had to pay for their drugs.

The £8.05 charge compares starkly with the cost of many commonly prescribed drugs that are now off patent, according to Dr James Cave, editor of the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin.

There are a host of exemptions to the charge – including age and pregnancy – but these extend to unrelated conditions. In an editorial, Dr Cave said many exemptions appear ‘illogical’.

He added: ‘It is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient-centred NHS and abolished prescription charges in England.’

The prescription charge has long been a contentious issue, says DTB, and even contributed to the resignation of Aneurin Bevan, the architect of the NHS, in 1951.

Since then, various calls have been made for a fundamental review of the charge, including from patient organisations, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, and the BMA.

Several alternative arrangements have been suggested, including getting the patient to pay for drugs at cost plus a reasonable dispensing fee to the pharmacist, which, incidentally is how private prescriptions can be dispensed, says DTB.

Although fees for private prescriptions vary widely, they can actually end up being cheaper than an NHS prescription.

Another anomaly is that while VAT is not paid on prescriptions dispensed in the community, NHS trusts have to pay the full 20 per cent levy on medicines dispensed from a hospital pharmacy.

Dr Cave said this may contribute to 'perverse prescribing decisions' which don't serve the patient well.

'Iniquitous': Figures reveal 80 per cent of patients aged 18-59 paid £8.05 for medication in 2012

He added: 'As a cost saving measure, many hospitals discourage doctors in outpatient departments from prescribing medicines to patients sitting in front of them in their clinic.

'Instead they are asked to write to the patient's GP recommending the prescription.'

He said this means the patient has to contact their GP to get the drugs they need before taking the prescription to a local pharmacy, which the DTB describes as 'clearly very inefficient and hardly patient-centred.'

Dr Cave added: 'Charges are clearly outdated and iniquitous, and we believe it is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient-centred NHS and abolish prescription charges in England.'
