Kate Upton is reportedly 'furious' Victoria's Secret used photos of her in its newest catalog, just over a year after the casting director for the lingerie giant's catwalk shows said she 'would never use [her].'

The busty 20-year-old was apparently shocked to discover old images of her posing in the brand's black Body bra have graced the pages of the lingerie brand's new catalog - without her permission.

A source told The New York Post: 'The pictures are from 2011. Kate's not currently contracted to work with Victoria's Secret, and they didn't contact her before they used these images.'

Surprise appearance: Kate Upton is 'furious' that her photo from 2011 was used in the new Victoria's Secret catalogue (pictured), without her knowledge. Just last year, the lingerie giant branded her look 'too obvious'

Another source close to the model told WWD that the left a 'bad taste in her mouth'.

The spokesperson added that Miss Upton is not necessarily 'furious,' over Victoria's Secret's decision, 'She’s just not thrilled about it, and the reason is she’s not contracted to work with Victoria’s Secret.'

It indeed came as some surprise to see her posing for the brand, given that she was the subject of scathing comments from the Victoria's Secret model booker, Sophia Neophitou, in a New York Times interview early last year.

Ms Neophitou told the paper that she would never book Miss Upton for the Victoria's Secret catwalk show.

'She is too obvious. She’s like a page three girl.' she said. 'She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.'

Ms Neophitou appears to be alone in her opinion of Miss Upton though. The model, who shot to fame after landing the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, has become the darling of the fashion set.

Career high: The model, 20 appeared on her second Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover this year

In just under 18 months, she has 
appeared on three Vogue covers, fronted the inaugural issue of CR 
Fashion Book, and posed in photo shoots for V Magazine, Terry Richardson
and Harper's Bazaar.

She has also attended the Met Gala and modeled in campaigns for Sam Edelman and Mercedes Benz.

And she still remains in favor with Sports Illustrated, who chose her for yet another Swimsuit Issue cover this year.

But while Miss Upton has never been an official Angel, it would seem that she did have something of a relationship with Victoria's Secret in her teens.

Buzzfeed reveals that she modeled 
pajamas for the brand back in 2011, when she would have been about 18, 
well before her Sports Illustrated fame.

But the site's Amy O'Dell explains that a model's presence in the catalog does not automatically qualify her for the runway show.

'Casting for the catalog and fashion show are seen as two very different things to the fashion community,' she said. 'There’s a lot of cross-over but it's not a fully symbiotic relationship.'

It remains unclear whether or not the image on the back of the new catalog is from the same 2011 photo shoot.
