Yesterday’s vicious storms may have wiped out some of the unbearable heat, but it also took something else with it – Amazon’s Cloud Service.

The Elastic Compute Cloud in Northern Virginia, which hosts several popular services including Netflix streaming movies, social photo app Instagram, and virtual pinboard Pinterest, succumbed to the storm last night, leaving thousands without their services.

With winds of up to 90mph, millions of homes across Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. were without power, dealing with scorching temperatures, torrential rain, and few social media applications with which to pass the time.

No movies: Netflix users were unable to stream TV shows and movies while the popular internet service was down following a power outage in Northern Virginia

Quirky problem: 'Fun and quirky' photo sharing site Instagram was also down, and tweted apologies for the technical difficulties

Down and out: Social pinboard site Pinterest was also down because of Amazon's Cloud outage

Severe thunder and lightning also had a role in taking away high-tech entertainment for D.C.-area residents.

All three companies posted messages to their official Twitter feeds after the outage.

VentureBeat reported that the Netflix technical support handle tweeted: ‘We’re aware that some members are experiencing issues streaming movies and TV shows. We’re working to resolve the problem.’

Instragram Support also noted: ‘We’re currently experiencing technical difficulties and we’re working to correct the issues. Thanks for your patience.’

Around 8:40pm last night, engineers said they had restored power to the Amazon dashboard, but continued to post throughout the night that they were making slow headway into restoring the three services.

As of Saturday morning, service to Netflix and Pinterest had been restored, but Instagram was still down.

A capitol mess: Storm-damaged trees litter the east lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington June 30 after wind gusts clocked at speeds of up to 79 mph

Uprooted: The high winds uprooted several trees in the American University neighborhood of Washington, DC, after the violent storm swept though the area

Massive clean-up: Tree branches lie near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Dupont Circle in D.C. following the storm; as many as four people are dead and 1.5million without power

Disappointed users took to social media to express their often hyperbolic outrage. One Twitter user wrote: ‘No instagram and no Netflix. I’m having a panic attack.’

Another cheeky user wrote: ‘My thoughts and prayers are with @Instagram, @Netflix, and @Pinterest. #RIP #NeverForget.

By Saturday morning, however, the three services had been restored to normal. However, residents along the Eastern Seaboard aren’t in the clear yet.

According to NBC Washington, four people were killed – two from fallen trees and another two by severe heat. And the mercury is expected to climb to the triple-digits again today.

Officials continue to warning residents over the extreme danger that high temperatures post.

During heat waves, it is highly recommend to drink plenty of water, stay indoors with the air conditioning or fan on if possible, wear cool, loose, clothing, and watch for signs of heat stroke.
