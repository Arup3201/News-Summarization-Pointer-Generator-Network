Everyone knows that Christmas is a time for giving.

In this vein, a heartwarming video has surfaced on YouTube showing a group of men lending a helping hand to their neighbours as a mark of the festive spirits.

The video shows two men  attaching an esky of Coronas to a makeshift pulley, before transporting it to another pair on an adjacent balcony, who are presumably running low on beers.

Two men attach the esky to a makeshift pulley before transporting it over to their adjacent neighbours

The video, titled ‘The spirit of Aussie Christmas’, begins with the men tying the ropes onto their balcony railing.

The men cheer when they begin to pull the esky from one balcony to the other, before the beer donors said ‘merry Christmas boys!’

‘That’s awesome! Open up the goodness,’ said one of the receiving men as he lifts the lid of the esky to reveal a 6 pack of crisp Coronas.

‘Thanks guys. Legends,’ he adds.

The description for the video, which was uploaded on Friday morning by planb aus, reads ‘my brother likes to invent s***.’

The receiving men are overjoyed at the donation, telling them ‘thanks guys, legends’

Overjoyed, the man can't wait to 'open up the goodness' and indulge in their Christmas gift
