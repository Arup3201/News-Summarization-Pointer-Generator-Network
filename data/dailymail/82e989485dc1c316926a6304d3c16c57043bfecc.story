Rapper Beanie Sigel has been released from a hospital - nearly one month after he was shot outside his brother-in-law's southern New Jersey home.

The 40-year-old musician, whose real name is Dwight Grant, left the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City last weekend, according to Pleasantville police. 

Sigel was shot in the abdomen December 5 at the Pleasantville home, where he had been staying after being released from a federal prison for tax evasion. 

The shooting occurred shortly after Sigel had dropped his children off at school.

Support: Neef Buck, a rapper in the Sigel-led group State Property, posted a photo online seemingly showing Sigel wearing a blanket and being helped into a SUV

'He's not doing so well. It's a really bad injury,' a source told BET.com of Sigel's recovery. 

Yesterday Neef Buck, a rapper in the Sigel-led group State Property, posted a photo on Instagram purportedly showing Sigel wearing a blanket and being helped into a SUV. 

Buck captioned the photograph 'Alhamdulillah !!!! Masha allah !!! MY BOY IS HOME !!!!!' 

Authorities say Sigel gave investigators a statement about the shooting before he left the hospital, but further details were not disclosed.

Captain Sean Riggin with the Pleasantville Police Department told Philly.com 'I'm not going to characterize whether he was cooperative or uncooperative.'

Riggin told the news outlet in response to a question about the statement's helpfulness 'Yes, sure. Every statement's helpful.'

Legal issues: Sigel was acquitted of a 2003 attempted murder charge stemming from a nightclub shooting. This 2004 photos shows the rapper and Damon Dash outside a Philadelphia courthouse in 2004

Philly.com reported that Sigel's sister-in-law Kamilah Slahuddin and other relatives are persons of interest. No arrests have been made. 

The New York Daily News reported that Sigel was acquitted of a 2003 attempted murder charge stemming from a nightclub shooting. 

According to the newspaper, authorities arrested Sigel for both drugs and weapons charges two weeks ahead of his prison date.

From 2000 to 2005, Sigel had three albums - 'The Truth,' 'The Reason' and 'The B. Coming' - hit the top five on the Billboard album chart.
