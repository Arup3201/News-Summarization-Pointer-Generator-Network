Two British soldiers died in a fire at Camp Bastion after a series of shocking safety failures, an inquest will hear this week.

Privates Robert Wood, 28, and Dean Hutchinson, 23, lost their lives when flames swept through  a logistical centre at the Helmand province HQ on the night of Valentine’s Day 2011.

Witnesses at the two-week inquest will tell a coroner that the office where Royal Logistics Corps troops were working and sleeping had no fire alarm and that the only exit they could have used to escape the blaze had also been sealed, leaving them trapped inside.

Private Dean Hutchinson, 23, died in a fire in an logistics tent at Camp Bastion on Valentine's Day in 2011

Last night, Pte Wood’s widow Becky Day, 33, said: ‘Rob died because of a series of safety failures which should have been addressed.

'If he had been shot or blown up I would accept that but he died in an entirely preventable fire and that is totally different.

'A lot of basic procedures were ignored for many weeks before this incident and nothing was done.’

An inquest will be told that Mr Hitchinson and Robert Wood, 28, who died alongside him were trapped in the tent after the only exit was blocked

Privates Wood and Hutchinson – plus one survivor – were sleeping in the tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived.

The MoD said last night: ‘Investigations were carried out following the incident and all findings have been shared with  the coroner ahead of the inquest.’
