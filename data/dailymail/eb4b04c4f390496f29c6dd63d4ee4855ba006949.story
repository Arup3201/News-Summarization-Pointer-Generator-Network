With a July due date, the Duchess of Cambridge is going to have to become a dab hand at dressing her bump for summer.  And she made a fine start last night with her first true maternity dress. 

Kate was the epitome of elegance in pregnancy in a bespoke powder blue 50s style Emilia Wickstead cocktail dress to an engagement at the National Portrait Gallery.

She also sported an impressively high pair of grey suede Rupert Sanderson heels and had her hair curled and swept partly back from her face.

Worthy cause: Kate was at the National Portrait Gallery to celebrate the work of The Art Room charity, which helps children experiencing emotional and behavioural difficulties

Main attraction: Kate drew a huge crowd outside the gallery

Waving to the crowds: The Duchess accessorised with diamond drop earrings

Kate's small baby bump looked more 
obvious than ever in the stunning gown, which had a demure neckline but 
was daringly low at the back.

The Duchess was attending the event to
 celebrate the work of The Art Room, one of the first charities she took
 on as a working royal.

It helps school children - largely in 
deprived areas - to increase their self-esteem, self-confidence and 
independence through drawing, painting and modelling.

Last night was the launch of their Pledge for the Future appeal and a celebration to mark their 11th anniversary.

The Duchess took  time to meet with 
some of the children who have benefited from charity's help as well as 
the staff who work with them.

In a speech she said praised the way in which it helped children stay within the education system 'and fulfil their potential'.

'I am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference and The Art Room makes this on a daily basis,' she said.

Julie Beattie, founder director of the
 charity, said: 'The Duchess's continued commitment and endorsement of 
our work has been an invaluable asset in securing the foundation and 
laying the path for future growth.'

Last night the charity announced the provision of two new projects in Ealing, west London, and Edinburgh.

The Duchess has a carried out a clutch of public engagements this week despite her advancing pregnancy.

She
 stood in for the Queen at an event with the scouts on Sunday, was on 
the gritty Wythenshawe estate in Manchester on Tuesday and will be 
taking a tour of the Harry Potter film sets in Hertfordshire on Friday. 
Then on Monday next week she is due to visit a hospice in Hampshire.

Her speech last night was her second of the week - a sign that the Duchess is growing ever more confident in her public role.

She has also clearly been working on her technique, sounding less stilted and over dramatic than before.

The
 arts is an issue she is hugely passionate about, having studied history
 of art at St Andrews University and being a keen photographer.

In
 a speech the Duchess said: 'I am a firm believer in the power of art to
 make a difference and The Art Room is doing that on a daily basis.

Happy patron: Kate beamed as she met staff who work at the project which helps children increase their self-esteem through art

'We all stand here tonight to 
celebrate this wonderful work. I hope that you will join me in 
congratulating The Art Room and their supporters on these extraordinary 
achievements.

'As 
patron of The Art Room, I feel immense pride to see the amazing work 
that they are doing but I also feel hugely excited to look to a future 
with more Art Rooms, where many more challenging and vulnerable children
 will be helped.'

During the event Kate  chatted to some children who have benefited from their classes.

Student Tiertha, 15, from Regent's School in Camden said: 'I have a picture of Kate on my bedroom wall in her wedding dress.

'I told her and she said 'wow' and she asked if William was in it as well and I said 'yes' and she said 'good'.'

Andrew,
 13, said: 'She asked how the Art Room has affected me and I said it 
makes me feel calm for the weekend. I go for two hours on a Friday.'

Kate
 is also patron of the National Portrait Gallery, where her first 
official portrait hangs as well as several portraits of members of the 
Royal Family.
