Michael Jackson's family arranged to secretly fly him out of the U.S. if he was found guilty of child molestation charges, it has been revealed.

Jermaine Jackson said a private jet financed by a friend was on standby to whisk the King of Pop to Bahrain if Michael was convicted in his 2005 court case.

The former Jackson 5 member said his younger brother was not aware of the escape plot, but would have agreed to flee America 'in a heartbeat' because he would not have survived in jail.

Escape route: Michael Jackson, with brother Jermaine on the right and father Joe, left, at his child molestation trial in 2005. Jermaine has revealed a plot to whisk Michael to Bahrain if he was convicted

In an interview with The Times Magazine, Jermaine said: 'If they were going to sit and crucify my brother for something that he didn't do, America deserves us not to come back here.

'At the end of the day, this is supposed to be the land of the brave, home of the free, democracy, freedom of speech.

'The way they were treating him, none of that existed. Why should he go to jail for something he didn't do?'

High profile: Los Angeles Superior Court has released the juror questionnaire for the trial of Conrad Murray, Michael's private doctor, on charges of manslaughter

Denial: Conrad Murray is accused of administering a fatal dose of the anaesthetic propofol which contributed to the King of Pop's death in June 2009

In June 2005, Michael was found not guilty of all charges after a four-month trial.

He had been accused of molesting Gavin Arvizo, then 13, giving him alcohol and plotting to kidnap him and his family.

Jermaine, 56, describes in his book - You Are Not Alone: Michael Through A Brother's Eyes - that he made a phone call to guarantee the flight to Bahrain was still available.

He also revealed he would revoke his own U.S. citizenship if Michael was convicted and would help to move his entire family to Bahrain - which does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S.

It comes after details of the jury questionnaire in the manslaughter trial of Michael's private doctor, Conrad Murray, were revealed.

Among 113 questions to potential jurors, the judge has asked how much attention they have paid to high-profile cases in the media, TMZ reported.

They include:

Family act: The Jackson 5 - from left, Tito, Marlon, Michael, Jackie and Jermaine, perform during the 'Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour' in 1972

Public opinion: A man holds up signs supporting Dr Murray outside the Criminal Courts building in Los Angeles. They have been fears raised over whether he can get a fair trial

Refuge? The plot would have seen Michael flown to Bahrain, where Jermaine Jackson was working during his 2005 trial, in a private jet

The questionnaire also asks jurors whether they know any of the potential witnesses, including Michael's siblings Janet and La Toya, as well as his children Paris, Prince and Blanket.

Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol complicated by other medications.

Authorities have accused Murray of administering the fatal dose in the bedroom of Jackson's rented mansion. He denies the charges.

Murray could face four years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on September 27.
