A sham marriage plot fell apart when the bridegroom forgot his future wife's name and told the registrar they communicated only by laptop, a court heard yesterday.

Zubair Khan was forced to phone his uncle to get the name of his bride-to-be during the first appointment with the official due to conduct the ceremony.

The blunder gave the game away and police and immigration officials turned up at the wedding to arrest the pair before they took their vows.

Khan, 28, a Pakistani national, was a former college student who turned to a sham marriage plot in a desperate attempt to stay in the UK because his student visa was about to expire.

His uncle Khaliq Khan, 48, a mobile phone businessman, agreed to help and they contacted Beata Szilagyi, 33, a jobless single mother from Hungary.

They found her through a mutual friend. She was offered £2,000, which she considered a 'vast amount of money', to come to England to become his bride.

As an EU national she was entitled to live in the UK. Yesterday both Khan and his uncle were jailed for 20 months at Hull Crown Court.

Szilagyi, who has a toddler son, was jailed for 17 months.

They all admitted conspiracy to breach UK immigration laws.

Szilagyi from Hungary is questioned by officials. The single mother, who has a toddler son, was jailed for 17 months

The couple were arrested at Hull's Guildhall moments before the planned ceremony last October, which was attended by 15 guests.

Both Khans lived in London but Hull was chosen as the wedding location because the uncle had a mobile phone stall in the local shopping centre.

Police had been tipped off by registrar Kay Skelton, whose suspicions were aroused by the groom's behaviour at their first meeting.

At a follow-up appointment attended by both bride and groom, Miss Skelton's fears were confirmed.

'The bride and groom did not communicate with each other or look at each other,' said Mr Thompson.

'Zubair Khan said they communicated entirely by lap top.'

The registrar also noticed he seemed 'nervous and was sweating.'
