A golf club boss and qualified first-aider ignored a barmaid who collapsed in a potentially lethal diabetic coma to carry on drinking - because he was off-duty.

An employment tribunal heard how 'contemptuous' Allen Gray failed to help or even dial an ambulance for Michele Polidano, 53, when she fell unconscious at Gorleston Golf Club in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Mrs Polidano, who had to be assisted by customers, resigned in disgust and has now won a legal battle with her former employers after launching a claim for constructive dismissal - but the club is still refusing to apologise.

'Appalling': When Michele Polidano fell unconscious at Gorleston Golf Club in Great Yarmouth, her manager Allen Gray failed to help her or even summon an ambulance, a tribunal heard

The tribunal ruled in Mrs Polidano's favour after hearing she had been put at risk by rules banning eating behind the bar, making it more difficult for her to manage her diabetes.

Referring to Mr Gray, panel judge Robin Postle said: 'It was, putting it mildly, appalling behaviour, contemptuous and unacceptable for a responsible line manager

'One has to bear in mind that if a hypoglycaemic attack goes untreated it could lead to cardiac arrest,' he added.

The tribunal heard that Mr Gray, a man of ‘some 25 stone’, had 'taken against' Mrs Polidano and had been known to fly into an aggressive rage in response to some of her 'reasonable' requests.

Golf Club manager David James had told the tribunal that Mrs Polidano was allowed to eat in the TV room and leave the bar unattended.

But the panel dismissed his evidence and described him as 'an evasive witness who found the truth an elusive concept'.

Following the settlement Mrs Polidano said: 'I’m just so pleased that it’s all over with.

'The last 11 months have been really, really stressful. I feel like my life has been on hold.'

She said the outcome of the incident might have been much worse were it not for the golfers at the club who came to her aid.

'I
get upset even thinking about it now, but if it wasn’t for them there’s
a possibility I might not be here today. I was very fortunate,' she 
said.

'I was so shocked at the time that I resigned the next day. Personally I can’t imagine treating another human being that way. I’m still shocked at what he didn’t do.'

She thanked the ordinary golf club members, who she described as 'kind and decent people'.

'Most of them had no idea of what I was going through - I think a lot of them were surprised,' said Mrs Polidano.

'But every time I wanted to give up, they helped me to keep going.'

Mrs Polidano’s additional claims of indirect discrimination and discrimination arising from disability were dismissed.

Golf Club manager David James today declined to comment on the ruling.
