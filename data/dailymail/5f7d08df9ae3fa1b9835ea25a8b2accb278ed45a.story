A stash of secretly taped recordings between Sylvester Stallone and his half-sister, who he allegedly abused, were destroyed as a part of the payout deal.

Sylvester Stallone paid his half-sister, Toni-Ann Filiti, 
more than £3million to ‘shut her up’ after she threatened to ruin his 
career with claims he abused her, the actor’s mother revealed last week.

The Rocky star agreed to give her a lump sum of £1.2million, as well as £10,500 a month for the rest of her life.

Allegations: Sylvester Stallone, left, secretly agreed a multi-million deal with his late half-sister Toni-Ann Filiti  amid claims he had abused her for years

Sibling: Toni-Ann Filiti, half-sister of actor Sylvester Stallone, is pictured in exercise clothes in New York in 1985

But it has now emerged according to 
confidential settlement documents, dated Aug. 3, 1987,  tapes were also destroyed which 
allegedly contained conversations between the pair.

Stallone is identified in one document only as 'S' reported the New York Post.

'This is to acknowledge receipt from 
you of a total of six cassette tapes, four of which contain 
conversations between you and your older half-brother who we are 
referring to as S.,' reads a letter made to Filiti by her attorneys.

'You understand that in accordance with the terms of the 
settlement agreement between you and S., I and your father are required 
to destroy all tapes.'

As part of the deal he also set up a 
trust fund for her, paying in £31,000 a year to cover medical expenses 
and psychiatric care, according to newly discovered court papers.

Miss Filiti died last August at the 
age of 48 after a long battle with lung cancer. In total, she received 
more than £3million from the settlement.

Stallone’s mother Jackie, 91, 
confirmed the actor had reached a financial settlement with her – but 
described it as a ‘shakedown’.

She said Miss Filiti, her daughter by 
her second husband, was a drug addict who blackmailed Stallone when he 
was at the height of his fame, in 1987. 

Miss Filiti, then 23, threatened him 
with a lawsuit alleging abuse. According to court papers obtained by a 
New York newspaper, she ‘asserted claims for personal injury, including 
physical injury’ against Stallone.

The papers show that the actor, now 66, ‘vigorously denied and continues to deny and dispute all claims of wrongdoing’.

Nevertheless, Stallone’s mother said his lawyers advised him to pay up to avoid any scandal that could have harmed his career.

She insisted her son was the victim of
 blackmail, stating: ‘This was nothing more than a shakedown. Toni-Ann 
was on 65 OxyContin [a high-strength painkiller] pills a day, and she 
threatened Sylvester. A drug addict will do anything. Sylvester was 
trying to help her. He caved in.

‘At the time he was very hot and his lawyers said, “Give her something just to shut her up”.’

Stallone was 18 years old when Miss 
Filiti was born. His mother had re-married after her first marriage, to 
Stallone’s father Frank, ended in divorce after nine years.

Despite Miss Filiti’s allegations, 
Stallone remained on good terms with his sister. He even cast her son 
Edd in his 1997 film Copland – but this week the 19-year-old maintained 
that his mother was telling the truth.

‘They’ve made my mother out to be the 
black sheep,’ he said. He alleged that his mother ‘screamed about’ abuse
 at the hands of her brother ‘over and over’ while in a Florida hospital
 last year.

A spokesman for Stallone said: 
‘Unfortunately, celebrities, politicians and athletes frequently find 
themselves the targets of blackmail efforts by family members and 
associates who fabricate claims in order to extort payments from them.’

Stallone’s film career took off in 1976 with the release of Rocky, which he wrote and starred in.

Family life: Stallone was left devastated when Sage, his son with ex-wife Sasha Czack, was found dead in his Los Angeles home on July 13 2012

He went on to become one of the 
highest-paid stars in Hollywood, playing Vietnam veteran John Rambo in 
First Blood which, like Rocky, spawned several sequels. He is said to be
 worth more than £160million.

His son Sage, 36, died of a heart 
attack at his Hollywood home last July. He was found days before he was 
due to marry his long-term girlfriend.

The only picture reported to have been
 found in his apartment was of Sage, aged 14, with his father. His 
lawyer and close friend George Braunstein said Sage ‘idolised’ his 
father and that the pair were ‘close’.

According to sources, he led a 
hermit-like existence and was living in a property littered with junk 
food wrappers, cigarette butts, empty cans and prescription drug 
bottles. He could have been dead for up to four days before his body was
 discovered.

Sage was the second of two sons 
fathered by Stallone with his first wife Sasha Czack, whom he divorced 
in 1985 after ten years of marriage.

Eleven months later he married actress Brigitte Nielsen but they split two years later.

Stallone is currently with his third wife, Jennifer Flavin, with whom he has three children.
