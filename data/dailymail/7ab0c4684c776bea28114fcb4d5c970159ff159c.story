A toddler died when a fireplace that her father had bought on eBay and glued to a wall in their house fell on top of her.

Trinity Liliana Coward suffered serious head injuries when the stone and marble mantelpiece came crashing down on her in July.

The two-year-old was taken to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital where she died of her injuries. 

Two-year-old Trinity Liliana died after the stone and marble mantelpiece fell on top of her at her home 

Today a coroner warned parents of the dangers of DIY which kills 'one child a year'.

The inquest heard how the girl's father, Shaun Coward, had glued the fireplace, which was not sold with fitting instructions, to the wall after buying it online. 

He fixed it onto a wall using No More Nails-type glue from B&Q with his father-in-law at the home in Lakenham, Norwich.

He watched as his beloved daughter swung from the top of the mantelpiece before it came crashing down on her. 

The distraught parent previously said he wished he had died rather than his daughter.

'Trinity was happy, being cheeky and running around.

'She reached up to the fireplace and started swinging from it.

'All of a sudden it came away from the wall.

'I rushed over and expected her to respond the way she normally did when she had a fall but she was lifeless. 

'She was my rock, She was a real daddy’s girl. I wish I could have died so that she could have lived,' he said.  

Recording an accidental death, coroner Jacqueline Lake said the child's death shed light on the dangers of unregulated DIY.

'This does highlight a lack of regulation in respect of the sale of secondhand fireplaces on a private basis and where they are fitted by an individual.

'Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.

'Trinity’s death highlights the dangers of carrying out do-it-yourself work in the home where a job like this requires professional installation.

'I make no criticism of Mr Coward - he was trying to make his home look nice and was unaware of the dangers he was facing.'

The 'happy' toddler was swinging from the mantelpiece at the family's home when it fell and crushed her, the inquest heard

One child dies every year in similar accidents, a Norfolk County Council trading standards officer claimed.

'The incidents all involve surrounds made from stone which are fixed to a wall with an adhesive. 

'It is not a suitable DIY project and should be approached by somebody with some knowledge of safe installation,' said Dean King.

Norfolk County Council has published advice to parents on how to avoid such accidents since Trinity's death. 

Sheila Merrill, public health adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: 'The most normal everyday items can be a risk to young children.

'Thankfully accidents of this nature are not a regular occurrence, however RoSPA's advice when buying modular, stone or artificial stone fireplaces is to seek professional advice before making the purchase and to get the fireplace surround fitted by a professional.

'Individual components of these fireplaces can weigh more than 50kg and, unless fitted in a secure manner, can in time come adrift from the fixing.'
