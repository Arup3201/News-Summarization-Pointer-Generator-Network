She's certainly got the moves on the catwalk, now Karlie Kloss is throwing some shapes in a new video that pays tribute to the height of the disco era.

Dressed in a series of revealing outfits the 22-year-old model writhes, twists and dances along with I'll Be There, Chic's first new song in decades.

Co-founder and lead guitarist Nile Rodgers enlisted the help of the 22-year-old supermodel for the video that harks back to the band's Seventies heyday, when hits like Le Freak dominated the dancefloor.

Fashion meets music: Nile Rodgers enlisted Karlie Kloss for Chic's comeback music video for I'll Be There

As the music starts, Karlie  is pictured relaxing in her living room surrounded by old disco records

The video starts with the former Victoria's Secret Angel relaxing at home, watching footage of Chic performing on Seventies television programme Soul Train. 

Lying on the carpet sporting a provocative off-the-shoulder jumper, high white socks and just her underwear the supermodel, writes and kicks her legs.

She's surrounded by records produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers by artists including Madonna and Diana Ross, and she clutches on the group's own records to her chest.   

Kloss then decides to try on an array of minuscule sparkly dresses, until settling on a skin-tight white flared cut-out jumpsuit, before attending a party where Chic are playing live.

At the bash, she is seen frolicking on stage with choreographer and legendary fashion insider, Stephen Galloway, as well as the modern-day Chic line-up.

While dance music fans are excited about the new Chic release, fashion insiders are captivated by the high fashion looks picked by Lady Gaga's stylist Brandon Maxwell.

He said the first scenes are a Flashdance reference and Karlie's later seen pulling on a tight pearl-encrusted dress by Adam Sellman. 

But her big moment comes when she dons a clinging  white Versace jumpsuit as she joins the band at a party that was actually held at New York Fashion Week in September,

Brandon told hollywoodreporter.com: 'I had seen her come down the runway in Paris and seen her at a party that night, wearing the jumpsuit and dancing around and flipping her hair everywhere, so as soon as we got those references for the video, I knew we had to have that exact jumpsuit by Versace.' 

Yet the outfits for the video almost looked very different. He told the site: 'That [Versace] jumpsuit almost didn't make it so we were counting down, checking every five minutes to see if it was coming. It ended up getting stuck because of the snow storm so it was delayed on a flight.'

In the mood for disco: I'll Be There is the 22-year-old model's music video debut

The funky music video was directed by famous Dutch photographer duo, Inez and Vinoodh (Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin), who were also responsible for Lady Gaga's Applause. 

And in it Karlie braves cold, windy temperatures as she emerges from a cab before joining the revellers inside.  

Nile - who also produced Madonna's album Like A Virgin, David Bowie's Let's Dance and Duran Duran's album, Notorious - posted on his Facebook page: '#I'llBeThere is a moving concept for me about decisions we make in life.

'We've tried to capture all the nuances in the full length video and still keep it fun. Karlie Kloss connects the past and present. 

'She sees the original group (who plays this track) on Soul Train. 

'She, visualizes the past looking at old school vinyl - then gets dressed and goes out to a current party to meet up with Stephen Galloway and the current line-up happens to be playing live.'

Kloss eventually stuns in a Versace Seventies-style flared jumpsuit and frolics with Chic's current collective 

The song is a tribute to CHIC's original bassist and vocalist, Bernard Edwards, who passed away in 1996

Chic became synonymous with New York's disco scene, with hits including Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love and Dance, Dance, Dance. 

I'll Be There is a tribute to Chic's original bassist and vocalist, Bernard Edwards, who was discovered dead in a Tokyo hotel room in 1996 by Nile Rodgers during one of the group's world tours.

It's based on an old Chic demo called Love Somebody Today, which features all of the original members of the band. 

Rodgers said: 'These recently-found lost tapes gives me the opportunity to play with my bandmates, who've passed away, again.'

The band is currently experiencing something of a revival as the Chic founder played guitar and co-wrote Daft Punk's inescapably catchy hit Daft Punk.

Karlie Kloss recently announced she would be hanging up her Victoria's Secret Angel wings to pursue her studies.
