Getting better: Ben Maycock was left minutes from death after the horrific unprovoked attack

A 21-year-old man who doctors thought would die after he was left with half a head following a hammer attack has finally taken his first steps.

Ben Maycock, of Leicester, was left minutes from death after the horrific unprovoked attack - and he was in a coma for three weeks.

Doctors at Nottingham's Queen’s Medical Centre had to cut away part of Mr Maycock’s skull to relieve the swelling on his brain - and his grief-stricken family were told to prepare for the worst.

But four years later, Mr Maycock is starting to piece back together his life after working hard to regain the movement in his legs - having had Botox injected to help him walk again.

Mr Maycock said: ‘It has been a long and slow process and there have been days when I’ve wanted to give up. But I worked hard every day to try and get my movement back. I just want to have a normal life again.’

And his 46-year-old mother Karen said: ‘It has been a hard journey for Ben. He has had his youth taken away for him. He should be out enjoying himself like other lads his age and instead he is stuck indoors.’

Leicester City FC fan Mr Maycock has been undergoing gruelling physiotherapy sessions three times a week to help regain the use of his limbs, which were left paralysed since the attack.

He must practise moving his limbs daily and also having weekly speech therapy sessions to help him communicate. He also has Botox injected into his limbs every three months to help his muscles relax.

Mr Maycock is forced to take a daily cocktail of pills to help control his fits and spasms - a lasting side effect of the attack. But he is trying to stay motivated.

He said: ‘When I got up out of my wheelchair for the first time and took a few steps unaided it was an amazing feeling and I really want to have a chance at a normal life.

‘It’s my dream to take my Labrador Benjy for a walk. Hopefully I will get there one day - but at the minute it would be Benjy taking me for the walk, not the other way round.’

Mrs Maycock said: ‘He has his down days - we all do - but life is looking more positive since he has started moving about on his own. This time four years ago we didn’t think he would be with us - his recovery has been remarkable.’

He has even managed to go and watch his football team play with his 50-year-old stepfather Paul.

Mr Maycock said: ‘By getting my movement back has meant I’ve been able to go watch Leicester City play football for a few weekends, and it’s a great feeling to be out and about.

But his mother said it has been hard for him to cope with the reaction of others since over the past four years - especially due to the dent in his skull left from his lifesaving surgery.

Mrs Maycock said: ‘People don’t stare at him because he is in a wheelchair but they would stare at the dent in his head. People are ignorant and rude, but Ben just gets on with it.’

Mr Maycock had a sizable portion of his skull removed after a hammer was plunged into his head during the attack in 2010.

This left him with a dent in his head - but he has been able to have a titanium plate inserted in an attempt to reshape his head.

He said: ‘When I first saw my head I was in a state of shock. I was just glad that I was alive. But when I would go out in my wheelchair people would stare. The operation has really helped my confidence.

‘And now that I am able to walk I am overjoyed - four years ago I didn’t think I get here.’

Daniel Hammonds, then 28, was jailed for six years and Jeremy Barnett, then 23, was jailed for 20 months at Leicester Crown Court in 2010 for their parts in the ‘merciless’ hammer attack.

Mrs Maycock said: ‘We didn’t think Ben would pull through at all so to see him, making progress every day is a blessing. He didn’t ask for this to happen and I am still angry. But he is very dedicated and recent developments have given us a lot of hope.’
