Esteemed author Harper Lee has denied giving permission to a journalist to document her life in a highly-anticipated new memoir.

The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first and only novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances.

However Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, claims to have become friends with Lee after moving into the house next door to her in Monroeville, Alabama, for 18 months in 2004.

Mills has now written a book about the experience, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, which was released by The Penguin Press on Tuesday and is being pushed as the first official account of Lee's life.

As Mills writes: 'I wasn't an unknown quantity but someone she (Harper Lee) knew and trusted.'

'I could not have done (the book) without the trust, support, and encouragement of Nelle (as Harper Lee is known) and (her sister) Alice Lee and their closest friends.'

But Lee, 88, has now released a letter to Entertainment Weekly to deny having anything to do with the project.

'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said.

'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised.

'I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way.

'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.'

It is the second statement Lee has released on the book.

The first was dated April 27, 2011.

At the time Lee wrote: 'Contrary to recent news reports, I have not willingly participated in any book written or to be written by Marja Mills. Neither have I authorized such a book.'

A big part of the dispute is a letter Mills has written by Lee's sister Alice.

Responding to the claims on Tuesday, Mills refers to the letter, while maintaining her book is not a Harper Lee biography but a collection of stories that Lee chose to share with her.

The written letter I have from Alice Lee, which she sent May 2011 in response to the original letter issued in Nelle's name, makes clear that Nelle Harper Lee and Alice gave me their blessing,' Mills said.

'In regard to the writing and release of Nelle Harper Lee's April 2011 statement about my book, Alice Lee (Alice Lee practiced law until she was 100 years old) wrote: 'Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence. Now she has no memory of the incident.' "

Penguin also released a statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Penguin Press is proud to publish The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee by Marja Mills today.

The book, a southern gothic novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1962, has sold over 30 million copies

'Mills' memoir is a labor of love and Marja Mills has done an extraordinary job. We look forward to sharing her story of the wise and wonderful Lee sisters with readers.'

Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.

USA Today book critic Charles Finch gave it 3.5 stars out of four, calling it a 'thoughtful, sweet-tempered, witty piece of work." He also noted that "Mills wrote her story with the approval of both sisters, and it sometimes reads more like a friend's account than a reporter's, which may be why it doesn't pry too insistently into Lee's secrets.'

To Kill A Mockingbird has sold more than 30 million copies.

Lee has not given an official interview since the book came out, but has intermittently released statements to media.

She has been described as a 'delicious mystery', and while having started other books, one a non-fiction about an Alabama serial killer, she filed them away as unfinished.

She is said to have been crippled by the pressure to match the success of her debut.
