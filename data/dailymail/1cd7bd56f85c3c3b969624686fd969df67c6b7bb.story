The gunman that killed six people and wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona two years ago began using drugs and believing that he could control his actions in his dreams in the months leading up to his rampage, according to newly released records on the police investigation into the shooting.

Jared Lee Loughner's parents told investigators they noticed a change in their son after he was fired from a sales job at Eddie Bauer, according to the records, which had previously been sealed.

'He just wasn't the same,' Jared's father, Randy Loughner, said. 'He just, nothing, nothing worked, seem to go right for him.'

Jared's mother, Amy, described his run-ins with authorities, his drug use and his deteriorating  psychological state.

'Sometimes you’d hear him in his room, like, having conversations,' Ms 
Loughner said about her son. 'And
sometimes he would look like he was having a conversation with someone 
right there. Be talking to someone. I don’t know how to explain it. I 
don’t.'

She and her husband 
pleaded with their son to seek psychological help shortly before the shooting,
but he refused, she said.

'I tried to talk to him,' Randy Loughner said. 'But you can't, he wouldn't let you... Lost, lost, and just didn't want to communicate with me no more.'

Growing increasingly concerned about their 
son's behavior, Randy 
Loughner said he had begun disabling his car so he couldn't go out
at night. The couple also confiscated a 12-gauge shotgun from Jared - which he had purchased in 2008 - after he was expelled from community college and administrators recommended that any firearms be taken away.

One-time friend Zachary Osler told investigators he had also grown uncomfortable with Loughner's 
personality, saying, 'He would say he could dream and then control what he was 
doing while he was dreaming.'

Osler was an employee at the store where Loughner bought a Glock before the January 2011 shooting.

He was questioned 
about seeing Loughner shopping inside sometime before Thanksgiving and 
he describes an awkward encounter with his former friend.

'His response is 
nothing. Just a mute facial expression. And just like he, he didn't 
care,' he said.

Still, Osler said he was shocked to learn Loughner had carried out such an attack.

'My jaw dropped,' he said. 'And I was like, "I know this 
person. Why would he do it? What would his motive be?"'

After killing six people and wounding 13 others outside
a supermarket in Tuscon, Loughner was polite and cooperative with 
police, though he complained of feeling sore as authorities 
began their hours-long initial interview of the gunman.

One of the arresting deputies who 
arrived on scene at the shooting reported that Loughner was repeatedly 
saying 'I plead the fifth,' as he was being handcuffed, even though no 
one was asking him any questions.

The officer said he found a folding 
knife with a four-inch blade in Loughner's pockets along with two loaded
Glock ammunition magazines.

The morning of his rampage, Loughner called a friend, Bryce Tierney, and left a message that the Tierney believed was suicidal.

'He just said, "Hey, this is Jared. Um, we had some good times together. Uh, see you later." And that's it,' Tierney told investigators.

Immediately before the shooting, Loughner was at a convenience store and he made another call - this one to a cab. The store's clerk recalled that Loughner was pacing back and forth inside and outside the store and that he visited the restroom at least four times.

At one point, Loughner looked up at a clock and said, 'nine twenty-five, I still got time,' the clerk recalled.

Loughner, now 24, was sentenced in 
November to seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years in prison after 
pleading guilty in August to 19 federal charges. His guilty plea allowed
him to avoid a death sentence.

He
is serving his sentence at a federal prison medical facility in 
Springfield, Mo., where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and forcibly
given psychotropic drug treatments.

Arizona's chief federal judge and a nine-year-old girl were among those killed in the rampage. Giffords was 
left partially blind, with a paralyzed right arm and brain injury.

She resigned from Congress last year and has since started, along with her husband, a gun control advocacy group.

The newly released police documents regarding the shooting 
mark the public's first glimpse into details that authorities have kept 
private since the attack more than two years ago.

News organizations seeking the 
records were repeatedly denied the documents in the months after the 
shooting

U.S.
District Judge Larry Burns had prevented the Pima County Sheriff's office from 
releasing the records in response to a request from The Washington Post,
ruling in March 2011 that Loughner's right to a fair trial outweighed 
whatever disclosures might be authorized under state law.

But last month, Burns cleared the way for
the release of the records after Star Publishing Company, which 
publishes the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, had sought their release.

The judge said Loughner's fair-trial rights are no longer a consideration now that his criminal case has resolved.

In addition to providing more 
information about Loughner, the records also contain horrifying accounts
from witnesses, including Giffords' intern Daniel Hernandez.

Describing Giffords, Hernandez said: 'She couldn't open her eyes. I tried to get any 
responses for her. Um, it looked like her left side was the only side 
that was still mobile. Um, she couldn't speak. It was mumbled. She was 
squeezing my hand.'

'I did some training as a Certified 
Nursing Assistant and as a phlebotomist, um, when I was in high school,'
he added. 'So I knew that we need to see if she's got a pulse. She was 
still 
breathing. Her breathing was getting shallower. Uh, I then lifted her up
so that she wasn't flat on the ground against the wall.'

Just before the shooting, Hernandez 
described how constituents and other people were lining up to see 
Giffords, and he was helping people sign in. He recalled handing 
Loughner a clipboard.

'The next thing I hear is someone yell "Gun!"' he said.
