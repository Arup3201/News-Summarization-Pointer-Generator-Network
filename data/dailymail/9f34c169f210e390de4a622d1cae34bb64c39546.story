A Rays spokesperson says that Peralta does have flu like symptoms but that he is still undergoing testing to see if it is really chikungunya.

While the virus isn't deadly it can be extremely uncomfortable and causes arthritis-like symptoms such as joint pain that lasts for weeks.

'To prevent chikungunya, it is vital that Floridians and visitors continue to avoid mosquito bites' said Dr. Jennifer Bencie, DOH-Manatee Administrator.

The Dominican Republic has even higher rate of chikungunya with over 170,000 cases in the Carribean as a whole, reported the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

The Dominican Republic accounts for 47 per cent of chikungunya cases in the Caribbean.

The Rays hasn't yet announced whether or not Peralta needs to be put on the disabled list or not yet.

WTSP offered some tips on preventing the virus from spreading.

Draining standing water in gutters, garbage cans,buckets, and pool covers can prevent mosquitoes from multiplying.

Homeowners should shut their windows and cover doors to keep mosquitoes from getting indoors.

Wearing insect repellant can also keep people from getting potentially harmful mosquito bites.
