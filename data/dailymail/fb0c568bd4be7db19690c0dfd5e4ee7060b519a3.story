This eagle's head nearly touches its back as it calls out to a friend.

The giant African Fish Eagle, known as 'the voice of Africa', shows off its flexibility by bending its whole body as it bellows from a tree branch.

These unique images show each stage of the bird's movements as it cries out from high up in a tree.

It resides in the sub-Saharan bush, mainly eats fish plucked from the water and is the national bird of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The images were captured by Canadian snapper Henrik Nilsson when he travelled to Botswana's Moremi Game Reserve.

And the 44-year-old was delighted to have photographed the eagle. He said: 'I sensed that the eagle would call out.

'I'd seen these eagles do this head throw before and knew that there could be a bit of an advance warning, so I kept my lens focused on the bird.

'As soon as the eagle started it's call, I held down the shutter.

'What strikes me most about this pose is the way the African Fish Eagle's head nearly touches it back while it vocalises.'

The photographer, from North Vancouver, revealed how Africa is one of his favourite locations to take pictures of wildlife.

He added: 'I do quite a bit of wildlife photography in my spare time.

'I am drawn to Africa for its incredible natural diversity and for the ample opportunities it offers photographers.'

Henrik admitted that in order to capture this special moment, he had to bide his time and wait for the perfect opportunity.

He continued: 'Any wildlife photographer will say that getting good shots involves a hurry up and wait approach: get out there, find a great spot, be ready.

'You have to be ready for that moment when something unique happens - that moment may not last long and second chances are unlikely.

'Observing the behaviour of your subjects often improves the chances of getting an interesting shot.'
