Closed: A strike by 300 staff at the Eiffel Tower forced its closure yesterday. Staff have complained that a restoration of the tower is being mismanaged

Thousands of holiday-makers have been left disappointed in the Italian and French capital’s after being denied access to their most famous attractions.

Workers called a wildcat strike in Rome and closed the 2,000 year old Colosseum last Thursday and again on Sunday and were threatening to close the attraction once more this Friday.

And in the latest economic disaster to befall President Francois Hollande's increasingly troubled government, the Eiffel Tower, the most popular tourist destination in the country was shut after 300 staff staged a walkout yesterday, complaining about appalling working conditions, low pay, and security worries.

The strike left thousands of visitors grounded below the 124-year-old Paris landmark.

Trade unions have been consistently complaining about mismanagement, saying repairs to the 1062ft wrought iron structure are long overdue.

Renovation of the west lift started in 2008 but remains unfinished, posing huge problems for the 30,000 odd tourists who arrive every day.

'Queues and overcrowding are the result,' said one employee, speaking under conditions of anonymity. 'Meanwhile, we have to deal with huge groups of unhappy people.

'Yes, visitors are going to be frustrated that they can't visit the tower, but a strike is our only way of making ourselves heard.'

A spokesman for the CGT, the biggest union behind the strike, said more were planned, and that members 'would stop at nothing' to achieve justice.

Yesterday, Italy’s Ministry of Culture said it would ‘pay the outstanding arrears of wages to date from January.’

During the Colosseum closures, hundreds of tourists were left queuing for hours in the hot sun with temperatures up to 35C. 

American tourist Nancy Price, who was left astonished when she was turned away from a pre-booked tour told the newspaper La Stampa: 'I sympathise with their cause but I don't know why they have to take it out on us.'

Roman tours guides are terrified that their groups will be denied entry. One guide Marinella Cementi said: 'It's unjustifiable. I have a group arriving Friday and there is a good chance they will be left outside with their tickets in their hands.'

Locked out: Tourists were locked out of the 2,000 year-old Colosseum last Thursday and Sunday

The closure of the world-famous amphitheatre has caused 'incalculable damage' to Rome and the tourist industry, Bernabo' Bocca, the head of the Italian hoteliers' association Federalberghi said.

'In a country like Italy, tourism activities should be considered essential public services,' he said.

'While we respect workers' rights, those of tourists and citizens are no less important.'

The association asked for Minister of Culture Massimo Bray to intercede, saying that 'mistreatment of tourists in Italy seriously damages the image of the country and has grave economic repercussions'.

The Italian government said it had found the money to 'pay the outstanding arrears of wages to date from January', but that there is no money to hire additional staff 'because of the economic situation.'

It is not the first time the Colosseum has closed shop. In September last year Colosseum workers walked off their jobs in protest against Prime Minister Mario Monti's cuts in public spending,

Restoration: Work to restore Eiffel Tower has been on-going since 2008. Workers have also complained about poor pay and working conditions

Then in December the grand monument had to close after heavy snowfall caused slabs of ancient lime plaster to fall from its crumbling walls.

It is already in dire need of restoration and is due to undergo a long-delayed 25million euro restoration later this year paid for by fashion house Tod's.

About 7,000 people a day visit the Colosseum - a 50,000-seacompleted in 80 AD and used for gladiator contests and mock sea battles in the Italian capital - paying €12 (£10) each for a ticket.

Wildcat strike: Workers at the Colosseum say they haven¿t been paid overtime wages since January

The Eiffel Tower was built for the 
Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1889, and has since become one of the 
most recognisable symbols of modern France. 

It makes millions of pounds every year
and draws thousands to the French capital, which is the most visited 
tourist city in the world.

The
tower's closure is a source of national humiliation, but typical of 
what has been happening since Mr Hollande came to power in 2012.

Industrial
action has been rife in the face of rising unemployment, the spiralling
cost of living, high taxes and almost zero economic growth.

Opinion
polls including one on Sunday continually portray Mr Hollande, the 
first Socialist to be elected to power since the 1990s, as the most 
unpopular president in the history of modern France.
