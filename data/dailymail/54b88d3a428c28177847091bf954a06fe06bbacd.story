'Hurt': Tina Greenland, 49, told police her boss had spiked her drink and raped her when he made it clear he did not want a relationship after they had sex

A 'scorned' nanny was jailed for two years for claiming her wealthy boss had raped her after he shunned her following a one-night stand.

Divorcee Tina Greenland, 49, shared a night of passion with insurance broker Nicholas Mouna, 55, after he employed her to care for his disabled daughter.

The mother of three texted him the next day saying she 'had a lovely night' and that she hoped he did not think she was 'some kind of tart', Canterbury Crown Court heard.

When Mr Mouna gave a 'half-hearted' response making it clear he did not want a relationship, she accused him of 'using' her.

She then phoned Kent Police and claimed she had been raped after her drink had been spiked.

Mr Mouna was arrested and suspended from his job, which he later lost - despite never being charged for the crime.

When detectives examined messages exchanged between the pair, they discovered Greenland's rape claims were fabricated.

Jailing her for two years, Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl - quoting from poet William Congreve - said 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'.

He said: 'You have been found guilty on the clearest of evidence of making false allegations.

'But this is serious because people who make false allegations make it harder for real victims to be believed.'

Greenland, of Folkstone, Kent, screamed, 'Oh no, my God no', as the sentence was passed.

She maintained her innocence throughout her trial, but her account of what happened on the night in December last year was rejected by the jury.

The child carer, who had been employed by Mr Mouna through an agency, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.

Jurors were told how Greenland pursued Mr Mouna - who has three children with his ex-wife - and sent him text messages asking him to go for a drink.

John Traversi, prosecuting, said: 'In 2011, Greenland began caring for the girl and after a while she began asking Mr Mouna if he would like to go to a country club for a drink and she began sending him texts.

'These texts intrigued him and flattered him and they agreed to go out in December.'

In December, the divorcee arrived at his home carrying a bottle of vodka after being 'dropped off' by her daughter and the pair shared a kiss.

Mr Traversi said: 'They had some drinks and they sat on the sofa and put her arms around him and kissed again and had some more drinks.'

He added that during the evening Greenland felt dizzy and she became 'hot and sweaty'.

Greenland went upstairs and was sick, but returned later to watch TV until 'he felt tired'.

The prosecutor added: 'Both of them went upstairs and Greenland said: "Which room?". He said: "The big one... if you want."

'The two then got into bed where they had sexual intercourse and engaged in other sexual activity during the course of the night.'

The court heard the following morning they woke up at 11am and had breakfast together before leaving.

Mr Traversi said: 'On the way home she asked if they would be seeing each other again... and he gave a half-hearted response.'

Later in the day, Greenland texted him saying: 'Hi Nick, just to say had a lovely night. Sorry about the sick and I do hope that you do not think that I am some kind of tart for sleeping with you.

'I would like to see you again and really do hope you do me. But if you don’t want to I won’t mind. Of course, it would be nice...'

Mr Mouna replied that he 'quite liked my single life', adding, 'I am quite happy to meet up with you and do it again with you'.

She replied: 'No, thanks for all that. I have just been used. Thanks a lot.'

Hours later, Greenland took an overdose of tablets and vodka and was rushed to hospital.

She had texted Mr Traversi saying: 'Well I hope you sort your life out because at the moment I feel like ending mine. I have got vodka and pills I just hope I don’t wake up.'

Paul Hogben, defending, said Greenland 'couldn’t cope with rejection.'

Mr Hogben said after the verdict that the text that Greenland received 'would have hurt anyone' and was read as 'I don’t want to see you anymore'.

He said: 'She reacted in the wrong way and she did make some effort to try to stop the ball from rolling but the consequences were that Mr Mouna was investigated for rape.

'She is not a bad person, but by the jury’s verdict she did a bad thing. She made a terrible mistake in circumstances when she couldn’t cope with rejection.'
