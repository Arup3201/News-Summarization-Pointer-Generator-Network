Edwin van der Sar believes Manchester United's new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek will be a success at Old Trafford.

Hoek will join the Red Devils as part of imminent manager Louis van Gaal's coaching staff, alongside assistant coach Marcel Bout, once the Netherlands' World Cup campaign in Brazil is over this summer.

The 57-year-old was Van der Sar's first goalkeeping coach at Ajax during the early 1990's, playing a crucial part in the Dutchman's development as the club won the Champions League in 1995.

Speaking to Manchester United's official club website, former fan favourite van der Sar gave his backing to Hoek's appointment.

'He groomed me and helped me learn all the things I needed to know to be a successful footballer over a lot of years,' he said.

'Like Louis van Gaal, he’s really exact with his exercises – they both put a lot of thought into them. He was one of the first guys I know who connected the goalkeepers with defenders and midfielders in terms of exercises.

'It wasn’t only about practicing goalkicks as a keeper – he would think about the different situations you might yourself be in during a game and try to find exercises and drills for us that he would combine with the outfield players."

Van der Sar also believes that current United number one David de Gea will only improve under Hoek.

De Gea, who has been selected for Spain's
 World Cup squad to Brazil, was one plus point for United in an 
otherwise miserable campaign as the club finished seventh in the Premier 
League.

The 23-year-old's performances didn't go unnoticed though as he topped a fans' poll to win Player of the Year, while his team-mates voted him Players' Player of the Year in the end of season gongs.

The former Atletico Madrid star's development should only continue to improve under Hoek according to van der Sar.

'He should be a great help for David,' he added.

'He used to work at Barcelona so he’ll speak Spanish, which will help, although I know David speaks good English now. I think they’ll be a good combination.

'After a difficult start in his first year, David has developed himself brilliantly over the last three years and performed so well last season.'
