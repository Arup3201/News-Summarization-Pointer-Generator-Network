Wayne Rooney got involved in the' Throwback Thursday' hype on his Instagram earlier today, when he posted a picture of the moment he met controversial boxing legend Mike Tyson.

The Manchester United captain has previously revealed that the former 'undisputed heavyweight champion of the world' was his all-time favourite sportsman.

Rooney admitted last year that he stopped boxing at the age of 14 to concentrate on playing football on the advice of former Everton boss Colin Harvey - which appears to have paid off.

United welcome struggling Leicester City to Old Trafford on Saturday and with the race of fourth hotting up - the England captain knows there can be no room for error.

The Red Devils will also be hoping there won't be a repeat of the meeting between the two sides earlier in the season, when Nigel Pearson's men fought back from 3-1 to win 5-3.

Louis van Gaal's side recovered from a disappointing home defeat to Southampton, to pick up three points away at Queens Park Rangers before the FA Cup meant a two-week Premier League break.

Rooney and his United teammates should take note of some Tyson's fighting spirit when the race for the Champions League reaches it's climax.
