Ninety rapists have received only a caution since the Coalition came to power, even though the crime carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, shocking new figures have revealed.

Critics said Britain was in the grip of a ‘caution culture’ which let thousands of serious criminals get away with just a slap on the wrist.

Despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘inappropriate’ for serious offences, a staggering 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years.

Over the last four years police have issued cautions for almost 15,000 offences that would typically result in jail prompting critics to blast the system which they claim is undermining the public's faith in the law (file picture)

In total, police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail – including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary.

Critics said the use of cautions for grave crimes was undermining the public’s faith in the ability of the justice system to properly punish offenders.

The damning statistics will fuel concerns that police and public prosecutors are too overwhelmed to deal with serious crimes.

In 1971, only 6 per cent of offenders were given a caution, which carries no sanction except a reprimand. The figure reached 20 per cent by last year, though this was down from 31 per cent in 2007.

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre For Crime Prevention, said: ‘A caution is never acceptable for crimes like rape or robbery.

‘There is a real problem of police cautioning serious offenders just so their figures show the crime was dealt with, even if it was actually dealt with in a ridiculously trivial way. Police need to tackle this culture immediately.

‘The overuse of cautions is putting the public at very great risk.’ David Green, chief executive of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘This is appalling. The police and prosecutors like them because they involve very little work. You just get someone to admit it and you’ve got a detection.

‘But they leave the public unprotected because you have a violent offender who is not in prison.

‘If a robber is in jail he won’t be threatening you with a knife in the street telling you to hand over your money.’

There were 181,000 cautions issued last year which meant the offender avoided being hauled before the courts – including 29,560 handed out to criminals by the Metropolitan Police.

The statistics were revealed by the Ministry of Justice following a Parliamentary question.

Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘The public need confidence that criminals are being properly dealt with, being both punished and reformed.

‘There is a caution culture driven by this government cutting corners trying to do justice on the cheap. For many victims of crime this is justice denied. Under this government’s watch too many cautions for serious, violent and sexual offences are being dished out, which is a slap in the face for victims.

‘Cautions inappropriately used for heinous and horrific crimes will lead to the public questioning whether the justice system is on the side of the law-abiding.’

Cautions became widely used for a host of serious crimes, including sex attacks and burglary, as police came under pressure to hit targets for ‘offenders brought to justice’.

They appear on a criminal’s record but do not result in further punishment. At the same time they allow the force to declare a crime ‘solved’, improving its conviction rate. Rules stating criminals should not normally receive more than a single caution were routinely flouted. Experts say the main beneficiaries have been young offenders.

Under the Coalition, the number of people cautioned for rape, burglary, robbery or sexual assaults has dropped from 4,273 in 2010 to 2,680 in 2013 – indicating Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is keeping his pledge to get tough on crime.

Ministers said cautions should be used for dealing with ‘low-level, mainly first-time offending’.

Police say that in some sex cases the victim did not want to go to court so cautions were handed out as it allowed the criminal to be put on the sex offenders’ register for two years. Cautions were issued for rape only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ when it was deemed ‘not in the public interest to prosecute’.

It is understood many such cases involved either under-18s, older people who committed rape a long time ago or those who may have been a partner of the victim.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures show clearly why I changed the rules at the end of last year to stop cautions being used for crimes like this unless the circumstances are quite exceptional. We are also stopping the use of cautions for repeat crimes.

‘We have already changed the guidelines for police officers, and are now passing a new law to tighten up the regime. People have to be able to have confidence in our justice system, and serious crimes should go to court and not be dealt with by a caution.

‘Under this Government offenders are more likely to go to jail, and for longer. Victims of crime expect no less.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The Government is clear that serious offences should always be brought to court and, to ensure that there is increased public confidence in the justice system, last year announced limits on the use of simple cautions.

‘These changes restrict the use of cautions for indictable only offences and certain serious either way offences unless there are exceptional circumstances and a senior police officer, as well as the Crown Prosecution Service for certain cases, has agreed that a caution should be administered.’
