A video of Ray Rice punching his fiancee inside an Atlantic City casino elevator was sent to NFL headquarters in April of this year and marked specifically for the attention of league security chief Jeffrey Miller, a law enforcement official says.

The NFL has repeatedly said that no one with the league saw the violent images until TMZ Sports released the video earlier this month.  

Jeffery Miller, the security chief for the National
Football League has said he never received the video of the former Baltimore Ravens star carrying out the attack. 

'I unequivocally deny that I received at any time a copy of
the video and I had not watched it until it was made public on
September 8,' Jeffrey Miller said in a statement.

A condensed version? But now, Rice plans to claim that the video, first obtained by TMZ, was a 'cleaned-up, whittled down and condensed version of the events', reported ESPN. Above, Palmer is seen lying on the floor

The NFL has repeatedly said no one with the league saw the violent images until TMZ Sports released the video earlier this month. Miller through an NFL spokesman that he never received the video

Miller was responding to an Associated Press report onThursday quoting an unnamed law enforcement source who said thevideo had been addressed to Miller.

Two weeks ago, that same
source had said he sent the package to the NFL, but did not
allow the AP to report who he addressed it to.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release details of the case, said he doesn't know if Miller ever saw the DVD or opened the package.

His only communication with the NFL was a 12-second voicemail on April 9 from league offices confirming receipt of the package, in which a woman says, 'You're right. It's terrible.' 

'Since the NFLPA and NFL have launched separate investigations into the league and the Ravens' handling of Ray Rice's case, I want to make a few things clear. No one from the NFL ever asked me for the inside-elevator video,' the official said Thursday.

 'I mailed it anonymously to Jeff Miller because he's their head of security. I attached a note saying: 'Ray Rice elevator video. You have to see it. It's terrible.' I provided a number for a disposable cellphone and asked for confirmation that it was received. I knew there was a possibility Mr. Miller may not get the video, but I hoped it would land in the right hands.' 

Miller joined the league in 2008 as director of strategic security and was promoted to chief security officer in April 2011. Before joining the NFL, Miller spent nearly six years as the commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police. He worked for the state police for 24 years.

At the NFL, Miller's responsibilities include overseeing investigative programs and services. He is also in charge of event security and game integrity. 

When players get arrested, the NFL's corps of investigators rarely get involved, leaving that to local law enforcement. 

The league's security operatives gather court documents and police reports available to the public, but don't ordinarily interview witnesses or gather evidence independently.

It remains unclear what happened to the video once it arrived at league offices.

The report could complicate matters for the NFL as it
struggles to regain its credibility for its handling of the Rice
case and four other domestic abuse incidents, amounting to one
of the biggest scandals in America's most-popular sports league.

The elevator security video of Rice knocking his now-wife
Janay Rice unconscious surfaced on TMZ.com on September 8, prompting
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to indefinitely suspend Rice from
the league after initially giving him a lighter punishment of a
two-game suspension for the domestic violence incident.

Criticised: Following claims the NFL knew about the video in April, a social media campaign has  emerged aimed at forcing NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (pictured) to resign over his handling of domestic violence cases

Goodell has said he had not seen the video either until it
became public, but he called an independent investigation into
how the NFL handled the Rice case after the first AP report two
weeks ago.

The release of the Rice video unleashed a wave of criticism
against the NFL from sponsors, fans, commentators and women's
groups and raised questions about Goodell's leadership and why
the NFL wasn't able to obtain the clip before TMZ.

Before handing down the two-game ban to Rice, Goodell had
seen an earlier video showing Rice dragging his unconscious
fiancée from the elevator.

Goodell has apologized for his initial lighter punishment
and has increased the ban on players who commit domestic
violence to a minimum of six games. 

Rice, a former Pro Bowl running back for the Baltimore Ravens, was arrested in Atlantic City on an assault charge for hitting Janay Palmer in February.

 A police summons stated that Rice had struck Palmer with his hand, knocking her unconscious. Rice has been accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, which enabled him to avoid jail time and could result in having the charge expunged from his record.

Initially, Goodell suspended Rice — who has since married Palmer — for two games.

After video of the punch in the casino elevator was released, the Ravens cut Rice and Goodell suspended him indefinitely.

League and Ravens officials said they requested the video from law enforcement but were denied. ESPN and others have reported that the Ravens had a detailed description of the video shortly after Rice was arrested.

After the AP reported that the video was sent to NFL headquarters, Goodell announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would lead an internal investigation. 

That probe is ongoing, and there is no timetable for its completion.
