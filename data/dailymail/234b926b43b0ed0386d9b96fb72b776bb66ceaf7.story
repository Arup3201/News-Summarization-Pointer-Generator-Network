Jailed: Soldier Jonathan Haynes was caught after one of his victims tore out her hair and left it behind in his car

A soldier who raped three teenage 
girls was jailed for a minimum of 11 years yesterday after a victim 
trapped him using tactics she learnt from television crime drama CSI.

In a six-month reign of terror, 
balaclava-clad Lance Corporal Jonathan Haynes cruised the streets in a 
car looking for young female targets who he attacked at knifepoint.

Detectives said last night it was hard to put a figure on just how many offences the 30-year-old committed.

He was finally convicted because one 
of his victims remembered the importance of DNA evidence from U.S. 
series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

After being bundled into the rapist’s 
Audi car the 18-year-old girl pulled out strands of her hair and hid 
them to ensure she left a trace of her DNA. She also spat on the 
upholstery to leave behind more vital evidence.

Later the girl drew a plan of a disused barracks area where she had been taken, to help detectives trap her attacker.

Haynes, who served with the Royal 
Logistic Corps, was convicted at Bristol Crown Court last month of six 
counts of rape, two of kidnap and two of attempting to kidnap.

Yesterday, he was given an 
indeterminate sentence with a minimum of 11 years. Police fear he could 
have attacked many more women in Wales and the West Country.

Passing sentence, Judge Neil Ford QC described him as a ‘clever and cunning predator’ and said he might never be released.

Addressing Haynes, he said: ‘You have 
expressed no remorse  and you still deny you were responsible for the 
offences ... you remain an extreme and continuing danger to young 
women.’

During the trial the jury heard how 
the soldier meticulously planned his attacks, prowling the streets of 
his home town of Chippenham, Wiltshire, late at night looking for young 
victims.

He would identify his targets before 
putting on a balaclava and gloves and pulling his car – which he had 
hired – alongside. He then dragged them into the car before driving them
 15 miles to the disused Hullavington Barracks where he raped them.

The soldier knew the area because he 
had served at nearby Buckley Barracks. His first victim was a 
16-year-old who he snatched at 3.20am as she walked home from a 
nightclub in Chippenham in September 2009.

Two weeks later Haynes raped an 
18-year-old student after forcing his way into her room in a hall of 
residence.

The soldier also attempted to snatch two 14-year-old girls 
from a   lane near Chippenham in February last year, but they escaped.

Weeks after that, he kidnapped an 
18-year-old in Chippenham and repeatedly raped her at the barracks. It 
was her DNA evidence which secured his conviction.

Haynes tied his victims’ hands, covered their faces and said he would stab them if they screamed.

The soldier then ordered them to wipe 
themselves clean with towels or wet wipes to destroy forensic evidence.

Speaking about her ordeal, the final victim, now aged 20 and who cannot 
be named, said that when she was pushed back into the car after being 
raped she decided she wanted to help catch her attacker.

‘I thought that whether I get dropped 
off at home or whether it’s worse than that, there is going to be an 
investigation and I wanted to help,’ she said.

‘When I was in the car I pulled out 
some of my own hair and I made sure I spat on the seat, so if it was 
ever found there was proof I had been in the car.’

When asked why she did this, she said:
 ‘It sounds silly, but I have always been a fan of CSI programmes. I’ve 
watched so many of them, I know what to do and how things work.’

She also drew a plan of a secluded house next to where the attack took place.

‘I’m just disgusted by him,’ she 
added. ‘I just think it’s horrible for a human being to have any 
thoughts like that. To have something done to me that was out of my 
control was the worst feeling in the world.’

Haynes was caught when the number plate of his hire car was recognised by a police camera.

After the hearing, Detective Chief 
Inspector Bob Hamlin said: ‘He is one of the most dangerous and evil men
 I’ve dealt with in 32 years of work.’

A teenager raped by soldier Jonathan Haynes said she found it harder to trust men after being the victim of the sickening sex attack.

The girl, who was 16 at the time of her kidnap and rape in September 2009, was snatched off a Chippenham street as she made her way home after a night working at a nightclub in the town.

The teenager, who asked to be called 'Abbi' to protect her  identity, said she found it hard now to trust men because of one 'sick individual'.

'What happened to me has definitely changed me, I'm so much more aware of what's going on around me when I'm walking on my own, even in the daylight,' Abbi said.

'I try my best to never have to walk somewhere alone at night, seeing girls walking home or anywhere on their own at night is so irritating.

'I never thought something like that would happen to me but who does?

'I'm not saying it will, I just want girls, not just young girls but girls of all ages, to be aware of the sort of people that are out there.

'I thought I was safe, only seconds away from my house. I learnt the hard way, I wouldn't want anyone else to.

'It's harder to trust men, just because of one sick individual, which is sad. But I'm with someone now and I'm very happy, so you can get through, you just need the right support.'

She said she was delighted when the jury found Haynes guilty after a three-week trial.

'When they gave the verdicts, I felt relief,' she said.

'I wasn't expecting the jury to give 10 guilty verdicts. It was very emotional. Although it still feels like it's not over.

'To anyone that has been through something the same or similar to what myself and the other girls went through, I'd advise them to come forward and tell someone.

'It needs to be reported to prevent the same happening to someone else.'
