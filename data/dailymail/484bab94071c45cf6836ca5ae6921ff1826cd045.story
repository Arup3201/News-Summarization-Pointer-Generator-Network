A drunk student had to be rescued by firefighters after she got her head stuck in a bottle bank while 'looking for more drink'.

Chelsie Redwood, 19, was on a night out with friends from Solent University, Southampton, when she jammed herself in the recycling bin.

The fresher was 'very embarrassed' to be stuck in the bottle bank in car park of the Civic Centre, according to Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. 

She eventually managed to pull herself free with the aid of a fire fighter and said: 'I will never do that again'.

A spokesman from Hampshire Fire and Rescue said: 'At 3.29am a female was released from a recycling bin using cutting equipment. A special equipment unit was called from Redbridge.'

Crew manager Chris Rashleigh, who was present at the scene, said: 'I think it was student night, I imagine she was looking for more drink. I think she had been there for a little while by the time we got there.

'When the fire crews turned up the girl was surrounded by friends with her head stuck in the bin with both feet on the ground.

'The girl eventually managed to pull herself free with the aid of a fire fighter.'

Mr Rashleigh said she was 'very embarrassed' to be stuck in the bin for such a long time.

'She was very relieved to come out. She said 'I will never do that again.'
