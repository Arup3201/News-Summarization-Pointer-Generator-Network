Long distance swimmer Diana Nyad, who turns 63 tomorrow, was out of the water this morning after weathering severe storms and jellyfish stings.

Nyad, who was attempting a historic swim from Cuba to Florida, emerged from the water at 7:42 am EST. Team members were unsure of the veteran swimmer would be able to complete the 103-mile crossing.

She was making her third attempt since last 
summer to become the first person to cross the Florida Straits without a
shark cage. She also made a failed try with a cage in 1978.

Recovery: The 62-year-old was badly burned from spending nearly 60 hours straight in the water; her lips were also swollen from jellyfish stings

Steve Munatones, a member of Nyad’s support crew, told Good Morning America today that the 62-year-old grandmother is in bad shape.

‘She has deep welts due to the box jellyfish stings,’ he began, adding that Nyad is also severely sunburned, as well as a strained bicep and weakness.

‘She gave it all she can,’ he said.

Nyad had planned to land somewhere in the Florida Keys on Tuesday, a day ahead of her 63rd birthday on Wednesday.

But it would have taken her another 28 to 40 hours to complete the crossing at the time she finally gave up, Reuters reported.

'Instead of getting hit with one doozy they got hit with three,' team member Vanessa Linsley told the Associated Press. 'They got hit with the weather, they got hit with the jellyfish and they got hit with the sharks all at the same time.'

She continued: 'They are discussing with Diana as to how she wants to proceed.'

The overnight hours Tuesday marked the second straight night of storms encountered by the swimmer.

and they got hit with the sharks all at the same time.'

On Monday evening, the swimmer's crew was improvising ways to prevent hypothermia and to fend off further swelling of her lips and tongue.

Though she's swimming in 85-degree waters, because that is lower than the body's core temperature, it will reduce her body temperature over time. Her team said she had been shivering.

'We all know her mind can handle it,' Candace Hogan, a crew member traveling with Nyad, wrote on the swimmer's blog. 'But there will always be a point where a human body can't go any farther. What no one knows is where that line is drawn in Diana Nyad.'

Australian Susie Maroney successfully swam the Straits in 1997, but she used a shark cage.

In June, another Australian, Penny Palfrey, made it 79 miles toward Florida without a cage before strong currents forced her to abandon the attempt.

Nyad has already endured jellyfish stings on the current attempt. Stings forced her to cut short her second of two attempts last year as toxins built up in her system.

She has been training for three years for the feat. She is accompanied by a support team in boats, and a kayak-borne apparatus shadowing Nyad helps keep sharks at bay by generating a faint electric field that is not noticeable to humans. 

A team of handlers is always on alert to dive in and distract any sharks that make it through.

She takes periodic short breaks to rest, hydrate and eat high-energy foods such as peanut butter. When she was pulled from the water, she had been awake for some 60 hours straight.
