The White House suggested on Wednesday that even if the information CIA operatives extracted from terrorism detainees through the use of torture tactics had led to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the brutal interrogation techniques should never have been used.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not concede that the measures taken by the CIA during the Bush administration did in fact produce actionable information, citing the divisions within the intelligence community and Congress on the issue.

However, he told reporters that the president believes 'regardless of which side of that debate that you're on, that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount when it comes to this question.'

The president believes 'that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount,' the White House's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today when asked by a reporter if the president thinks torture was acceptable if it led to the execution of Osama bin Laden

A Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday concluded that waterboarding and other questionable measures employed by the CIA in its questioning of an al Qaeda commander did not lead the detainee to offer up information crucial to tracking and taking down bin Laden on May 2, 2011.

'A review of CIA records found that the initial intelligence obtained, as well as the information the CIA identified as the most critical — or the most valuable — on [bin Laden courier] Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, was not related to the use of the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques,' the report states.

According to the Senate Democrats who authored the study, the CIA waterboarded 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed 183 times in one month as part of what a medical officer described as a 'series of near drownings' and subjected him to sleep deprivation, rectal rehydration and stress positions. 

Yet, the Senate report states that he repeatedly gave them 'fabricated' or 'unfounded' information.

One al Qaeda affiliate that Mohammad named, Hassan Ghul, did play a central role in the slaying of bin Laden, the paper says, but Mohammad volunteered that information before he was worked over by the CIA. 

Ghul also gave the CIA intelligence pivotal to the hunt for bin Laden, according to the report. But that, too, came  before he was mistreated.

'He sang like a tweetie bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset,' a CIA officer is quoted as saying. 

It was after his initial confessions that he was deprived of sleep, the Senate review said. And when it was determined that he had told the truth, the CIA lied and said he gave up the information only after he was put through physical and mental discomfort.

In its response to the Senate report, the CIA said it is 'impossible to know in hindsight' if the information that led the U.S. to bin Laden could have been secured through traditional methods.

'However, the information we did obtain from these detainees played a role — in combination with other important streams of intelligence — in finding the al-Qaeda leader,' the agency said. 

The president's spokesman also refused to engaged in a counterfactual with reporters today on whether or not bin Laden would have been taken out had the CIA acted less aggressively, telling them at his daily briefing that 'it is impossible for us to go back in time and determine whether or not some of the information' that backers of the techniques believe 'yielded information that was critical to the success of the mission could have also been obtained through other measures.

'It's impossible and unknowable, actually, whether or not that information that they say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used,' he further clarified. 

Earnest said that the president did receive an intelligence briefing before the raid that resulted in bin Laden's death, but it 'doesn't necessarially provide a detailed account of how that intelligence was obtained.'

'The point is,' he said, the president has 'spoken unequivocally about his view of this matter.

'It is his view that the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques does not serve our national interest, it does not make us safer, because it undermines our moral authority, and our moral authority around the globe is critically important to protecting and even advancing American interests,' he concluded.

After U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin laden in Pakistan in May 2011, top CIA officials secretly told lawmakers that information gleaned from brutal interrogations played a key role in what was one of the spy agency's greatest successes

In this May 3, 2011 photo, local residents gather outside a house, where bin Laden was caught and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The White House said today it's 'impossible and unknowable' whether or not the information that backers of enhanced interrogation 'say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used'

At another point in the briefing he told reporters that 'there are other things that we can't know, but there is one thing that the president knows...that continuing to employ the techniques that are described in that report would only undermine one of the most powerful weapons on our arsenal to protect American national security. 

'And that is the moral authority around the globe of the United States of America,' he said.

President Obama believes 'that tool is worth protecting and strengthening,' Earnest explained, 'and that's why he outlawed these techniques' during his first few days in office and directed the Department of Justice and his national security team to conduct a 'broad review of the guidelines and procedures for interrogating and detaining individuals in custody.'

It's also why he 'strongly advocated' for the Senate to publish its review, he said.

Ahead of Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein's release of the study revealing the depth and breadth of the post-9/11 program that subjected terrorism suspects to treatment that Obama has said 'constituted torture,' former President George W. Bush, Republicans on Capitol Hill, and even Secretary of State John Kerry urged the California lawmaker not make the 600-page report public, at least not at this time.

Feinstein refused to back down, however, as her time as the committee's head dwindled down. 

'Is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people?' she said in an op-ed released Tuesday in the Los Angeles Times simultaneously with the Senate's finished CIA review. 'The bottom line is, torture occurred, and we must own up to our actions and move forward.'

'We're not perfect and there are some dark patches in our past, but what makes us special is that we recognize these evils, we come to grips with them and we fix them,' she said.

Noting Obama's support for the release of the redacted documents and his executive action in 2009 to disband the program, Feinstein said the 'report is the next step toward enacting major reforms to ensure something like this never happens again.'
