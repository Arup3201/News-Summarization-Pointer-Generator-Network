Three men and a woman appeared in court today accused of helping to hide the dismembered body of murdered teenager Becky Watts.

Karl Demetrius, 29 and his girlfriend, Jaydene Parsons, 23, were charged with assisting an offender after the 16-year-old's cut up remains were found in their home.

The couple allegedly acted to help Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews – has been charged with her murder – evade detection.

Karl's twin Donovan Demetrius and James Ireland, 23, also stood in the dock charged with the same offence of assisting in the 'disposal and concealment' of Becky's body parts.

Suspects: Jaydene Parsons, 23, (right) has a young son with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Karl Demetrius (left). Both have today been charged with assisting an offender in relation to the Becky Watts murder

In custody:  Donovan Demetrius (left) has also been charged as has Jamie Ireland, right, and all four appeared in court today. A fifth suspect was released without charge

The defendants spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and did not enter pleas during the short hearing.

They are jointly charged with assisting an offender without lawful authority or reasonable excuse between February 22 and March 3.

The charge alleges that they 'did an act, namely assist in the disposal and concealment of the body parts of Rebecca Watts with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of Nathan Matthews, who had committed the offence of murder'.

Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of killing his stepsister and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of 'consistently lying to police' in an attempt to protect her boyfriend.

Matthews, who was unshaven and wearing a grey sweatshirt, appeared via video link from HMP Bristol, and did not enter a plea this morning.

Judge Neil Ford QC, Recorder of Bristol, remanded Matthews in custody and set another hearing for March 26 and he expected a trial after September 1.  

Prosecutor James Ward told the court: 'Nathan Matthews is charged with the murder of Rebecca Watts.

'The allegations of this case have been well-rehearsed in the press recently and I do not propose to go into the finer details.

'There are still people helping the police with their inquiries. Therefore, it would be wrong to place before the media further details about this case.'

Becky, 16, was last seen at her home in the St George's area of Bristol on February 19. Body parts thought to belong to the teenager were found on Monday night after police were called to an address in Barton Hill

Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of his first hearing yesterday

Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom yesterday charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice

Police discovered body parts on Monday night after they were called to a property at Barton Court, in the Barton Hill area of Bristol (top right). They also searched a second house, and a blue car parked outside (bottom right). Barton Court is just a street away from a house in Cotton Mill Lane (bottom left) which has been searched extensively, and is opposite Becky's boyfriend Luke's house (bottom centre). Police  also searched Becky's home (top right), and a house in Southmead (top left) where they seized a black Vauxhall Zafira

Mr Ward said police were assessing 'at least' 1,200 exhibits in connection with the case.

'Much forensic work needs to be done,' he said.

Paul Cook, representing Matthews, said his client was not making an application for bail.

Matthews' girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, who is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, will also appear before the court charged with perverting the course of justice on that date. 

They were detained after detectives attended a house in Barton Court, Barton Hill in Bristol, following information that Becky's body had been 'cut up'.

Nathan Matthews (left) was remanded in custody and will appear via video link before Bristol Crown Court tomorrow. Hoare (right) was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court on April 2

As a white custody van left the court shortly before 11am yesterday, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away

Yesterday, Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges after 16-year-old Becky's dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week.

Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky's father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews' mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol.

Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare's young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather.

Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses.

Becky vanished from her home in Bristol on the morning of February 19. Police launched a huge search operation after she was reported missing the following afternoon.

But on Monday night detectives discovered her 'cut up' body at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol.
