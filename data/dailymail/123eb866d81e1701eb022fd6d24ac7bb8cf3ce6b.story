A pair of bogus brides recruited using Skype to take part in sham marriages in the UK have been jailed.

Bulgarians Nadya Kamenova, 20, and Tamenuzhka Slavcheva, 21, were paid in total more than £4,000 to ‘marry’ two Pakistani men facing deportation.

The young mothers were both flown to Manchester after being contacted online by sham marriage organisers.

Now both women have been jailed after admitting conspiring to facilitate breach of UK immigration law.

The women were locked up alongside fake groom, Muhammed Saleem, 28, who married Slavcheva in a ceremony observed by undercover borders officials, called in by suspicious staff, at Manchester Register Office last February.

Saleem, from Rochdale, Lancs, paid Slavcheva £1,000 to marry him after his student visa was rescinded.

Four days earlier, Saleem acted as a witness in the fake marriage of Mohammed Shahbaz to Nadya Kamenova.

Mr Shahbaz, who has so far escaped arrest, is suspected of organising a number of other sham marriages.

Manchester Crown Court heard that his bride Kamenova was recruited by her UK-based aunt, who is suspected of being another of the organisers, via Skype, and paid £3,400 for the job.

Once over here, Kamenova helped make arrangements for her cousin Slavcheva’s arrival

David Toal, prosecuting, said: 'Before the accession of countries such as Bulgaria and Romania to the EU, most previous sham marriage cases involved "brides" from affluent countries like Holland, and invariably spent only a few days for the marriage in the UK before returning to their lives in their own country.

'Such transient passage within the UK, gave the marriages the obvious appearance of shams.

'By choosing brides from poor countries such as Bulgaria, the grooms could be confident that their brides would be more willing to remain within the UK for longer periods of time or come to the UK on repeated visits.'

Michael Johnson, defending Saleem, 28, said he was an ‘industrious and law-abiding person’ who had not claimed benefits in the UK and ‘very much regrets’ his crime.

Simon Nichol, defending Slavcheva, said she was a ‘naive young woman’.

Recorder Bernadette Baxter, sentencing, ordered Kamenova and Saleem to serve 20 months behind bars, and Slavcheva to serve 12 months, saying the ‘extremely serious offences fundamentally undermine the legitimate immigration system’.
