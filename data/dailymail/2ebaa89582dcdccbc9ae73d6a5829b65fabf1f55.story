One of the first signs that Operation Royal Baby is in full swing will be when an armed policeman appears on the steps outside the hospital. 

By that time Kate will be on her way and is expected to be taken into the Lindo through one of three side entrances. 

Meanwhile, obstetrician Marcus Setchell will be alerted on his specially-encrypted mobile phone by the Royal couple’s private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton.

The couple have yet to pick a name for the royal baby, and have opted not to find out the sex before the birth

Assuming he is at his North London home at the time, Mr Setchell will grab his carefully prepared overnight bag and climb into his silver BMW.

The six-and-a-half-mile journey to the hospital should take no more than 20 minutes. But in case of heavy traffic, he can always put the green flashing light he is entitled to use as a doctor on call on the roof of his car. In the early stages of labour, Kate is likely to have her mother Carole at her side.

But sources are now indicating that Mrs Middleton will not be present during the delivery, as has been suggested.

In common with other patients, the Duchess will give birth in one of the six delivery rooms on the Lindo’s third floor, which features ‘soothing’ block colour murals by London-based artist Julian Opie. Courtiers have spoken of a ‘range’ of  finely-tuned contingency plans, quietly confident that they have thought of everything.

Yet one rather important matter remains unresolved. 

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that William and Kate have yet to choose a name for the future heir to the throne.

The couple, who asked not to be told the gender, have drawn up a shortlist of boys and girls’ names – but, like many modern couples, will only make a final decision after the baby is born.
