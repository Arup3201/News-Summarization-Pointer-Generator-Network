Costly: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza cost the taxpayer almost £1million in legal fees during his eight-year fight against extradition

Legal cases involving hate preacher Abu Hamza cost taxpayers almost £1million.

The hook-handed extremist, who was finally kicked out of the country last month, benefited from almost £680,000 in legal aid money from the public purse.

In addition, the Home Office spent nearly £250,000 on lawyers in its efforts to get him out.

The scale of the fanatic’s abuse of legal aid, revealed by freedom of information requests, caused outrage last night.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling ordered an immediate review, saying: ‘We must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer.

‘The total costs in some cases seem very high, and many – myself included – will question whether they provide value for money.

‘I am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system. I have ordered an immediate examination of aspects of the system that affect its credibility with the public. Legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system, but resources aren’t limitless. It should be reserved for cases where there is genuine need.’

Hamza was put on a plane to the US last month after the last of countless legal appeals was finally thrown out of court.

Freedom of information requests by the Mail reveal that Hamza’s lawyers were paid £445,452.65 to defend him against charges of inciting terrorism. Legal costs in his eight-year fight against extradition cost a total of £165,460.81.

Hamza was also given legal aid worth £68,107.33 to fight attempts by the Home Office to remove his passport, a case he won.

The total expenditure included more than £400,000 for Hamza’s solicitors, Arani and Co, and more than £100,000 for one of his barristers, Edward Fitzgerald QC.

The Home Office spent £79,728 on legal costs for the extradition case, and another £150,674.91 in its efforts to strip Hamza of his passport and citizenship.

It means the total legal bill for taxpayers was £909,423.70.

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The cost of booting out this vile hate preacher has been tremendous. Taxpayers appear to have been the last ones in anyone’s thoughts during Hamza’s drawn-out but ultimately futile legal fight.’

When his extradition case came back to court for the final time last month, Hamza claimed he was unfit to face terrorism charges in the US because ‘harsh’ conditions at HMP Belmarsh had left him depressed.

But after a three-day hearing, Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, said he was ‘wholly unpersuaded’ by these claims, adding that ‘the sooner he is put on trial the better’.

After the verdict, Hamza was flown to New York, where he is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan.

He is accused of involvement in a hostage plot in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. He also faces charges of setting up a terror training camp in Oregon.
