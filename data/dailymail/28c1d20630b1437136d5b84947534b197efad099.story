One in six universities – including top institutions such as Oxford – have been awarding too many good degrees, a groundbreaking study has claimed.

In the first analysis of its kind, researchers looked at the ‘academic profile’ of students who graduated in 2011.

The statistics, which included exam results from school, were then used to predict what degree results the students were likely to achieve.

Experts believe that some institutions are 'over-rewarding' top grades

They discovered that out of the 123 English universities that were examined, 21 awarded significantly more firsts and 2:1s than expected.

The list included several members of the elite Russell Group including Oxford, Liverpool, Newcastle, Warwick and Exeter.

The universities insist their high rates of top degrees were down to good teaching.

But the study, which was carried out by the Higher Education Funding Council, has cast renewed doubt on the value of degree grades, which are controlled by universities with little outside scrutiny.

External examiners – academics from other institutions – check how exams are marked but generally only ensure a consistent standard for a pass mark, rather than a first or 2:1.

The figures led to warnings that university league tables are encouraging academics to mark exams leniently.

Experts said the research pointed to ‘over-awarding’ by some universities which was contributing to grade inflation.

Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The results add statistical clout to the widely held view that some universities award more firsts and upper seconds than is  justified by their intakes. One of the drivers is the natural wish of universities to score well in league tables.

‘The percentage of firsts and upper seconds they choose to award actually contributes significantly to those tables so there is quite an incentive to award good degrees.

‘Almost certainly there has been inflation in degree classes. Firsts and upper seconds have gone up too rapidly for it to be genuine improvement.’

Experts believe that university rankings should not use results as this encourages in grade inflation

And he called for the tables to stop allowing degree grades to influence rankings, saying: ‘The biggest single contribution to allowing these difficult judgments to emerge dispassionately would be to remove that perverse incentive.’

Professor Smithers also pointed to strong regional patterns. He said that if a university saw an ‘institution down the road giving out a lot more good degrees than they are, they may think they are being too hard on their students. It suggests the standard that is set is subjective.’

The survey also showed that 18 institutions – including Imperial College London and King’s College – awarded significantly fewer good degrees than expected. However Exeter, which in 2011 handed out one of the highest proportions of firsts and 2:1s out of any university in England, awarded the top two grades to 82.8 per cent of students.

A spokesman said its ‘focus on excellent teaching is borne out in our degree results’.Cambridge gave the top two degrees to 87.4 per cent of students and Oxford awarded the grades to 90.9 per cent of students in 2011 – more than any other university.

An Oxford University spokesman said: ‘At Oxford, we offer a high level of individual teaching.

‘We are confident that this approach, combined with rigorous examination processes, ensures that final degree classifications accurately reflect the very high abilities of our students.’
