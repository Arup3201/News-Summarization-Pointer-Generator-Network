It was a case of friends reunited for one lucky girl in New Zealand when she chatted with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

During the royal couple’s tour of the Omaka Heritage Aviation Centre, nine-year-old Tallulah Dabinette was plucked from the crowd with her sister and mother and presented to them.

But it wasn’t the first time that they’d met.

Tallulah first made her acquaintance with Prince William in 2005 at Waitakere Hospital, when she was just seven months’ old.

And she reminded him of the occasion by giving him a photograph taken at the time.

The picture, in a gold, acorn-themed frame, shows Prince William bending forward and greeting Tallulah, who was dressed in a pink-striped hat.

'You told her she had piano fingers,' said the sisters' mum, Sara-Lee Debinette.

'I never did! I'd never say such a thing,' said William, laughing.

World War Two veteran Wilton Sterritt shared a 
photo of himself with Prince Phillip with the Duchess much to her 
delight

Tallulah and her seven-year-old sister, Eloise, told the royal couple that they are both trumpet players and gave Kate a pink and yellow posy.

Tallulah, who was brought forward to meet the royal couple by Kate’s assistant after she’d heard her story, said: ‘I'm going to tell all the people at school. She was so pretty. I wish I could look like that every day!’ according to MSN.

It wasn’t the only photograph of a royal encounter presented to the Duke and Duchess.

During a walkabout in Blenheim, Kate 
spoke at length to Wilton Sterritt, who fought for the Royal New Zealand
 Navy in the Second World War.

The
 Marlborough resident, who saw fighting in the Atlantic, the Indian 
Ocean and with the Pacific Fleet, showed Kate a picture of him with the 
Duke of Edinburgh in 1974.

Happy snaps: Film producer Sir Peter Jackson, of Hobbit fame, takes a photo of the Duchess on his iphone as she stands by one of the vintage aircraft in his collection at Omaka Heritage Aviation Centre

It was taken, he explained, when he was part of the Commonwealth Games committee organising shooting events.

The Duchess giggled and said: 'You've changed a bit!' as she pointed at his bright orange outfit and remarked that Philip had done too.

'She was beautiful and just charming. I am over 90 so my mind is a bit of a blur about what she said but she seemed tickled by the picture my daughter dug out for me,' he said.
