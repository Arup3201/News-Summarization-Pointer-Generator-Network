Argentina were ready to implement a high-risk strategy and start with Angel Di Maria in the World Cup final - until the player pulled out of training with a suspected thigh injury.

Di Maria had to go off in the quarter-final win against Belgium after injuring his muscle and Argentina were desperate to add to their attacking options for Sunday’s final with Germany.

Manager Alejandro Sabella was eager to use Di Maria, a key player in the tournament so far, at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, but his plans may have been set back.

High spirits: Di Maria looked in a good mood despite the injury that forced him to pull up

Di Maria had responded well to treatment all week and came through fitness tests on Saturday.

The Argentines were hopeful he would be able to start against the Germans, but pulling up in training will come as a blow to Sabella.

The Argentina boss said on Saturday: ‘We will see on Di Maria. We have special things planned for him. We will see. I'll have a better idea after we've trained.'

Di Maria, who has been undergoing stem cell injections to speed up his recovery from a torn thigh, is set to replace Enzo Perez if he can play.

Hopeful: Sabella says he will know more after Argentina assess Di Maria's injury ahead of Sunday night

Replacement: Sabella was likely to replace Enzo Perez with Di Maria if he could do so against Germany
