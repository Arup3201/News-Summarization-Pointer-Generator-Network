On the surface, the picturesque Suffolk village of Bruisyard appears the perfect quiet rural idyll.

But the usually tranquil community has been rocked by a vicious hate campaign sparked by a business owner's application to hold late night parties in a stately home.

Robert Rous, who owns the 700-acre Bruisyard Hall, a wedding and conference centre, is the focus of a rural rebellion after trying to get a licence extension to boost business.

His bid sparked a sinister series of events, including vindictive poisoned pen letters being delivered to every 
resident in the village, obscene graffiti daubed near the site 
and the hall's gates being vandalised by a mysterious perpetrator.

Now the backlash he and his manager Paul Daws have unleashed has become so serious the parish council's chairman has had to appeal publicly for an end to the bitter dispute.

In an open letter on the village’s website parish, councillor Peter Robinson said: ‘What has happened to our peaceful quiet village?

‘We have been torn apart by the recent goings on, anonymous letter drops, the latest of which libels various members of the community, vandalism of the new gates at Bruisyard Barn, red paint spread across the entrance to the drive, obscene graffiti scrawled on one of the signs at Bruisyard Hall gates.’

Trouble erupted when Mr Rous launched a number of applications to allow the hall to stay open until 2am, to boost the business and increase revenue.

Historic: The tiny village of Bruisyard was mentioned in the Doomsday Book and has a population of about 175 people

After opposition from Suffolk Coastal District Council and the parish council, a revised bid to open as late as 12.30am and 2am 
on 10 nights a year, won support from officials.

But the backing sparked rebellion in the 175-strong village by the River Alde, 
which dates back to Saxon times.

Mr Rous and his venue’s manager Mr Daws have now spoken out in an attempt to pacify furious villagers.

Mr Rous said: ‘A number of recent events, including numerous letter drops, have led to the misconception that Bruisyard Hall and Barn is going to be something other than an upmarket wedding and events venue, which it’s simply not.

‘The original licence application may have sounded frightening because of the hours that they covered, but of course we only ever planned to be open for a fraction of the time allowed.

‘There has been a lot of misunderstanding. It’s never been our intention to do anything other than a wedding and events venue.’

Dispute: Bruisyard Hall owner Robert Rous has spent thousands of pounds improving the barn as part of plans to extend the drinking hours at the wedding and conference venue

The venue has hosted weddings and conferences for many years but wants to capitalise on that

He added: ‘We have been holding weddings here for some time but instead of a marquee we now intend to use the newly-renovated barn, and subsequently need to apply for a licence.

‘I take my stewardship very responsibly. We are very much part of the community, my uncle used to live here and I’ve been here since 1979. It’s a family-run business, Paul is marrying my daughter, the buck will stop with us.’

Mr Daws said: ‘The people who will come here will be wanting to enjoy a weekend away in the country. The barn is designed to cater for a wedding of up to 140 people. We have absolute control over the venue and the types of events held there.

A Suffolk Police spokesman confirmed they were investigating reports of criminal damage and said they were also award of the poison pen letters.
