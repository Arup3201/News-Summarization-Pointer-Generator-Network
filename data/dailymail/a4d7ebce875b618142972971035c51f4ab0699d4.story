For decades, it has been the picturesque gateway for millions of visitors to the Yorkshire Dales.

Countless sightseers en route to the rolling countryside have discovered the gentle charms of Masham, with its cobbled, tree-dotted Georgian market square, traditional tea shops and the famous Theakston’s Brewery.

But now the tranquillity of the ancient town on the banks of the River Ure has been punctured by a very British battle between residents and the bureaucrats they blame for pushing it ‘off the map’.

Once a popular tourist route to the Dales, the picturesque village of Masham is now far quieter as passing trade is no longer directed to the village

Visitor numbers have plummeted since long-standing road signs directing drivers to the town from the nearby A1 were removed as part of a multi-million-pound upgrade of the dual carriageway to a six-lane motorway.

The original turn-off to the town was closed and no new signs were erected at a new junction two miles further south.

Many drivers now do not leave the A1 until the next junction, about 11 miles further north – depriving local businesses of hundreds of thousands of pounds in passing trade.

Caravan park owner and parish councillor Flo Grainger, 66, will soon permanently close her Old Station cafe on the road into Masham, with the loss of five part-time jobs and an estimated annual income of £50,000 to £60,000.

She said: ‘We used to be open most days of the week but recently we have reduced this to weekends, which is not sustainable. The number of cars on this road has dropped hugely. It is devastating.’

In the market square, Susan Turner, who runs a plant and pet food stall, said: ‘Something needs to be done. We are losing passing trade as tourists use other routes.’

Lucy Scott Paul, who has run the sweet shop Bah Humbug for eight years, said: ‘Business has been dreadful. I have experienced a  20 per cent drop in sales. Some people think the issue of the signs is a small matter, but to us it is having a significant impact.’

Her sentiments are echoed in other shops, from the Joneva delicatessen to the Border House tea rooms.

Masham Parish Council chairman Andrew Burrell warned that other businesses, from a farm making its own ice cream to a restaurant favoured by Prince Charles, are also vulnerable.

‘The route through Masham and the lower Wensleydale area is about 12 miles long, and other  villages such as East Witton could lose out,’ he said. ‘We are not  talking about a pub and six  houses. There are hundreds of businesses involved.’

The parish council was told it would have to pay more than £36,000 to erect brown tourist signs, an amount it cannot afford.

Jo Theakston, the 36-year-old marketing director of the renowned Black Sheep brewery, one of two in the town run by the Theakston brewing family, said his business relied heavily on  the tourists who stopped off at its visitor centre.

‘I am extremely angry,’ he said. ‘It has been such a long campaign and now they say we have to  pay. It’s ludicrous. This is one of the most iconic and well-known tourist areas in the country.’

His cousin Simon Theakston, 55, the executive director of Theakston’s Brewery in Masham, added:  ‘I don’t think the Government could have done a better job in inconveniencing people. I don’t know who is to blame, but whoever it is should be deeply embarrassed. I am angry because it is completely incompetent.’

The traditional junction on the A1 for Masham was closed as part of an upgrade of the road.

Under a scheme agreed between the North Yorkshire County Council and the Highways Agency,  a new turn-off was created – Junction 50 – some two miles further south.

The roads into and out of the Yorkshire village are far quieter since the changes were made to the A1

But parish councillors in Masham – 
pronounced ‘Massam’ – say it was only when the disruptive road-widening 
work began that they found out all six signs that had previously 
directed  drivers to Masham were to disappear and would not be replaced.
Councillors were told that because the A1 was becoming a motorway, new 
criteria applied, and Masham did not qualify for signs as it was not a 
‘primary destination’.

However,
after a campaign by Conservative MP Julian Smith, the Department of 
Transport ruled Masham could have two large brown tourist signs at the 
new Junction 50 to help regenerate its flagging tourist trade. But as 
the signs are ‘outside normal regulations’, the town was expected to 
fund them itself.

Businesses in the picturesque village of Masham are in uproar as the traffic to the village has fallen dramatically due to the lack of signs

To the horror of Mr Smith, an initial assessment by the Highways Agency costed the two signs at £190,000.

This was eventually reduced to £36,000 on the condition that the parish council would sign an open-ended deal agreeing to meet any unforeseen extra costs – something the council feared could lead to bankruptcy.

Mr Smith said: ‘I have been staggered by the sums of money quoted for the installation of two brown signs and very disappointed by the lack of appreciation by the Highways Agency of the devastating economic impact that not having signage is having on Masham.’

Last night, the Highways Agency said it has now placed tourist signs to Masham for motorists driving down from the north –  at Junction 51 where the A1 is still a trunk road – but that it was still trying to find an ‘affordable solution’ for drivers travelling from the south.
