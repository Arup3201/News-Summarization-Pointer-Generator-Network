A stuntman has set the new world record for being a human torch after set alight by his wife.

Austrian Joe Toedtling, 33, managed to walk around the streets of Aalzburg burning for five minutes and 41 seconds before the heat became unbearable.

He was set on fire by his wife Julia, and he said: 'She always knows how to get me hot, so she was the obvious choice for turning up the heat on this stunt.'

Record: Stuntman Joe TÃ¶dtling managed to burn for five minutes and 41 seconds before the heat became unbearable

But it was nevertheless enough to give him the title in the category 'Longest Duration Full Body Burn (without Oxygen Supplies)'.

Although Guinness does not encourage dangerous records, the stuntman said that professional stunt men and women were allowed to offer records for professional scenes.

He beat the previous record holder the American Jayson Dumenigo who burned for five minutes and 25 seconds.

Mr Toedtling wore a special suit from the Salzburg based firm Texport under the standard flame restricting materials.
