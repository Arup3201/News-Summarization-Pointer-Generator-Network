She's the Siberian-born beauty who has been turning heads since she burst onto the tennis scene in 2004 and won Wimbledon aged 17.

Now Maria Sharapova, 27, has opened up about her passion for tennis - and her desire for a simpler life - in an interview with The Edit, Net-a-Porter's e-zine.

Sharapova, who has appeared in campaigns for Tag Heuer and Cole Haan among others in the past, also shows off her glamorous side, smouldering for the camera in an accompanying photo shoot.

But despite her striking looks and unparalleled ability to look good in a dress, Sharapova says that what she most wants is a simple life at her beachside home in California.

'I live a simple life by the beach where people don’t bother me much,' she explains. 'People seem to respect athletes that way.'

One group of people who don't are the paparazzi, who thanks to interest in her relationship with fellow tennis pro Grigor Dimitrov, 23, seem to be able to find the couple anywhere.

'I think, "Oh my goodness. How did they find us?" We’re in the middle of nowhere, just sand and ocean, and all of a sudden a boat shows up.

'When we’re at home and away from the sport, we’re just two normal people who try to go about our life in a casual way, so [the media attention] is funny.'

But not even media attention can stop Sharapova from throwing herself into her real passion - tennis - and she says she has her parents to thank for her success.

'The thing my parents taught me was that they were completely fine with going back to Russia, to the life we had before,' she reveals.

'The biggest gift they gave me was a sense of reality. They saw that I had potential, and they knew that there were sacrifices we had to make. But they never imagined how far we could go.'

While Sharapova has lived in the US since the age of seven and currently resides in California, she says she remains a Russian at heart and adores her home country.

'The way that I speak and think is very Russian,' she confesses. 'I’m accustomed to [the US] but ultimately, it’s just the feeling you have inside.'

She also says she remains passionate about seeing the world, despite spending more than a decade on the gruelling tennis tournament treadmill.

'I think of the 80/20 balance for my body and mind,' she insists. 'Disciplined 80 percent of the time, relaxed for 20.'

It's a lesson that many of those left bruised by her 90mph serves and powerful approach will want to learn for themselves.
