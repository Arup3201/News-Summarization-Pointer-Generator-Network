His dorky haircut, sweater-vest, puffy smile, squint and braces made him an unexpected online phenomenon - but the real-life 'Bad Luck Brian' is actually a church builder named Kyle.

While his image is re-purposed constantly online by anyone wanting to illustrate the depths of incompetence or sheer misfortune, Kyle Craven, 25, quietly works away for the family construction business in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

His high school photo, taken when he was 16, is the visual accompaniment to jokes such as 'Wears bullet-proof vest... gets shot in the face', 'Has a pet rock... it runs away' and 'Hires life coach... benched'.

Behind the meme: Kyle Craven, left in his normal life, found a joke yearbook photo (right) turned into a vision of incompetence and misfortune after it found its way online

It has also personally earned its star $20,000 in royalties from big-money ad campaigns in the United States and across the world, the Washington Post reported.

The snap shot to fame after a friend uploaded it to the Reddit forum in 2012 and is struck a chord with the other users, and he joined the ranks of others whose images became inexplicably famous and repeated millions of times.

Craven explained that he was a class clown and made the photo ridiculous on purpose - he bought the sweater from a thrift store, rubbed his cheeks red before posing then pulled a stupid face.

Indeed, the picture was so obviously silly that the school principal wouldn't let it in the final cut of the yearbook.

But Craven and a school pal, Ian Davies, took a digital copy of the picture that would eventually secure his fame - though it would take six years for Davies to eventually share it with the world.

Lucrative: Exposing himself to mockery worldwide has brought in as much as $20,000 for Craven

'Famous': Craven, seen here wearing a t-shirt of himself, has found himself less in demand of late - but still gets the occasional call

It made its way to t-shirts, stuffed animals and novelty items sold bu the likes of Wal-Mart and Hot Topic, while companies like Volkswagen, and others as far away as Chile and Poland paid up to use his pictures in their ad campaigns. 

The deals, which he negotiated himself, made him an estimated $20,000, and Craven tried to capitalize on his internet kudos even further by filming videos about his character.

He even traveled to Los Angeles for a 'date' with another meme character - Laina Morris, or Overly Attached Girlfriend. While the two didn't fall in love, the resulting video was watched more than 2million times.

But, he told the Post, his fame and profitability had an expiry date. While he first video was viewed 350,000 times, interest waned fast.

His latest effort, from December old, has attracted an audience of fewer than 10,000, and his monthly Youtube earnings now rarely breach $100.

Now that the internet has turned its attention elsewhere, Craven is left with his job as a project manager for church construction. He recently adopted a dog.

He considers the picture 'something to show my grandkids one day' - and in the meantime does everything he can to give Brian one last outing whenever another fan comes calling.
