A Chicago CEO twice shot by a 'despondent' executive following a demotion has died in hospital, two months after the attack, his family announced this week.

ArrowStream's ex-chief technology officer Anthony DeFrances shot company chief Steven LaVoie, 54, in the head and stomach before turning the gun on himself about 9.50am on July 31.

Jody LaVoie, the victim's wife, wrote on the website CaringBridge.org. that her husband had 'succumbed to his numerous injuries'.

'I had truly hoped to tell a different story now about his recovery, and for so long I believed he would be with us again,' the post said, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.

'But know that the man you all remember so dearly, fought so bravely.

'Steve brought great dignity and beauty to all of our lives these past months.'

LaVoie, a father of three daughters, survived and was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in an 'extremely critical condition'.

DeFrances, who joined the company when it was created in 2000, died at the scene. He was 59.

The shooting occurred in the tech logistics company's office on the 17th floor of the Bank of America building on LaSalle Street in Chicago's busy Loop business district.

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told CBS Chicago at the time that DeFrances, also a married father-of-three, was told a few days earlier he was being demoted as the company downsized.

McCarthy said DeFrances was 'despondent over the fact that he got demoted', went into work this morning and demanded a one-on-one meeting with LaVoie.

During the meeting, the Tower Lakes man allegedly pulled out a gun.

As the two men struggled for the firearm, LaVoie was shot in the head and stomach with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun, which was recovered at the scene.

The gunman had a Master of Science in Experimental Psychology and a Masters of Computer Science from the University of Dayton.

DeFrances had worked at ArrowStream since 2000, when it was founded by LaVoie.

The logistics company, which provides support to fast food restaurants, was this year named as one of Chicago’s 'best and brightest' companies to work for.

According to his profile on the Junior State of America website, LaVoie completed a Masters in public and private management at the Yale School of Management after gaining a Bachelor of Arts from The University of California, Berkeley.

The California native received numerous professional accolades, including becoming an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2010 Midwest honoree and an Illinois Technology Association 2010 CEO of the Year finalist.

He served on the Board of the Chicago Institute of Psychoanalysis and chaired its investment committee.

Chicago Tribune reported LaVoie and DeFrances were friends as well as co-workers.

DeFrances's neighbors in Tower Lakes described him as polite and a loving father to his adult children - two sons and a daughter.
