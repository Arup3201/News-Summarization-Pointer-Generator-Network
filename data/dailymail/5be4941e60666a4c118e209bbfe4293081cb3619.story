Calling for help: Commons speaker John Bercow has ordered a hotline that allows staff to report bullying

Bullying MPs will be more easily reported by staff after Commons Speaker John Bercow ordered a whistleblowers’ phone line to be set up.

The confidential hotline will allow anyone working in Parliament to report harassment, bullying or other gripes when it goes live later this month.

Employees from across the Palace of Westminster from bar staff to research assistants will be able to use it. The phone line will offer confidential support and advice and it is understood it will be manned.

The decision to launch the phone line, sanctioned by the House of Commons Commission, comes in the wake of the court case involving former deputy speaker Nigel Evans. The senior Tory strenuously denies accusations of sexual assault.

It also follows damaging claims of inappropriate sexual advances by Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard against party workers and volunteers.

Lord Rennard has always denied any wrongdoing and the Liberal Democrats are working with the complainants and Lord Rennard to try and broker a truce.

Although the main political parties have internal processes for dealing with claims of bullying and harassment and the Lords and Commons have other welfare services, there is no single unified help point for employees.

Unions have asked the Speaker and Commons Commission to come up with a system for all staff.

In a statement announcing the phone line late last night, Mr Bercow said that Parliament was an ‘extraordinary place in which to work’ and that the Commons ‘strives to be an exemplar of good employment practice’.

He said the phone line was a ‘step in the right direction in modernising the culture of the House of Commons, clearly signalling that, wherever the place of work, people are entitled to be treated with dignity, courtesy and respect as they carry out their work.

He added: ‘Parliament is an extraordinary place in which to work and the House of Commons strives to be an exemplar of good employment practice. I am pleased that a helpline for staff is going to be established, as a safety net designed to complement existing pastoral care.’

The Speaker himself is no stranger to claims of being difficult to work for.

He lost two private secretaries in two years. One branded him as being ‘intolerable’ to work for and claimed she had been pushed out for being ‘too posh’ while another was ‘too old-fashioned.’
