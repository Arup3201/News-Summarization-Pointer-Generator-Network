He's on the three-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or but Manuel Neuer didn't quite end his stellar year as planned on Friday night.

The 28-year-old has made a lot of strikers look foolish with his impressive outfield ball skills, but this time the Bayern Munich goalkeeper got a taste of his own medicine as the German giants travelled to Mainz.

Neuer was made to look rather foolish for the hosts opener on 21 minutes as Elkin Soto's left-footed shot at the near post rather embarrassingly nutmegged him.

In a moment that would be more akin to a slapstick comedy, Neuer's reaction to conceding the goal is priceless as the towering German is literally left flat-footed by Soto's strike and ends up falling over to the ground.

The 34-year-old's goal was Bayern's fourth conceded in 17 league games, the fewest ever in the first half of a Bundesliga season.

Despite the Colombian's effort though, Neuer would eventually have the last laugh as strikes from team-mates Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben saw Pep Guardiola's side turn the match on it's head.

Robben's 90th minute winner sends Bundesliga leaders into the winter break with a commanding 14-point lead.

Their eighth successive league victory also maintains the Bavarian outfit's unbeaten run in Germany's top tier this season.
