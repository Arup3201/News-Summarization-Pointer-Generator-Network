Nick Clegg has been accused of allowing Liberal Democrats to 'work to rule'

Nick Clegg has been accused of allowing Liberal Democrats to ‘work to rule’ as they concentrate on trying to cling on to their Commons seats.

With their party crashing in the polls, ministers are said to be failing to pull their weight in the last months of this Parliament.

Lynne Featherstone, the Home Office minister, has absented herself from key Commons business, according to two senior Whitehall sources.

Karen Bradley, a junior Conservative Home Office minister, had to stand in for her during a recent debate on child abuse, while a whip, Damian Hinds, was due to take her place in a discussion on anti-social behaviour.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey, meanwhile, is alleged to be spending more and more time campaigning in his marginal Kingston and Surbiton constituency, which the Tories hope to win in May, rather than in his Government department. Mr Clegg himself ducked out of the Government’s Autumn Statement on Wednesday and instead went to Penzance, a marginal Lib Dem seat.

‘Taxpayers will be shocked to discover some Liberal Democrat ministers are on work to rule,’ said one senior Whitehall source. ‘Lynne Featherstone is getting paid a ministerial salary but is not doing the job properly. Apart from anything else, it’s important that the Commons gets a chance to question ministers on key issues.’

Even some Lib Dem colleagues, including former Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, criticised Mr Clegg’s absence from the Autumn Statement. The Deputy Prime Minister has also been absent from the past three sessions of Prime Minister’s Questions. Tory ministers suspect the Lib Dems are attempting to distance themselves from the Government ahead of the election.

George Osborne claimed the Lib Dems agree to Coalition plans in private, ‘and then in public they slag them off’. The Chancellor was infuriated after Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed his plans to dramatically reduce spending were ‘wholly unrealistic’.

Miss Featherstone, who faces a tough fight to fend off Labour attempts to overturn her majority of 6,875 in Hornsey and Wood Green, north London, was moved to the Home Office from the international development department last month, after the resignation of Norman Baker.

A Lib Dem spokesman denied that Mr Clegg had given Miss Featherstone, who is paid £100,000 as minister of state, a green light to miss debates and accused Tory colleagues of ‘mischief-making’. He said she had been on the front bench several times since being appointed.

‘It is categorically untrue to say Nick has told Lynne Featherstone that she doesn’t have to do any Parliamentary business. She has done Home Office questions, a debate about drug misuse and a select committee on violence against women. Sometimes ministers have other ministers cover for them.’

Of Mr Clegg’s no-show, the spokesman added: ‘We are always being told politicians don’t understand how their policies affect ordinary people, so Nick went to speak to people in Cornwall.’
