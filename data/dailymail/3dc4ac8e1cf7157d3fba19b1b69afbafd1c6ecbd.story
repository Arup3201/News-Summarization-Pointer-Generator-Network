She is rarely pictured without a beaming smile on her face as she goes about her royal duties. But yesterday the Duchess of Cambridge was showing the strain of keeping up with her busy schedule at almost eight months pregnant.

She looked pale and tired, with fine lines on her forehead, as she left an exclusive London hotel, and, unusually, failed to offer onlookers even the briefest of grins.

Nevertheless Kate, 33, still showed off her impeccable style in a floral print dress, matched with navy Alexander McQueen court shoes and an understated £255 Russell & Bromley Muse Suede Clutch.

Well this is a nice surprise. We weren't expecting to see the Duchess of Cambridge today but here she is looking fresh as a daisy in a lovely floral print frock as she stepped out of the Goring Hotel.

This spring-ready dress is by Erdem and is from the London based designer's Resort 2013 collection. So not only is Kate rocking one of the coolest high end labels around but she's still wearing regular fitting clothes, despite being seven months pregnant. How does she do it?

With fans in Alexa Chung, Kate Bosworth and Keira Knightley, Erdem is now a regular feature on the red carpet and Kate's look today confirms just how into fashion she is. Styled with her favorite navy blue suede Alexander McQueen heels and a clutch by Stuart Weitzman, she's the picture of elegance. And what you can't see is that the dress has a cute cut out at the back. Gorgeous!

Unfortunately it is no longer available to buy but if you click the link (right) you can take a look at the current collection at Net-a-Porter. For those who want to steal Kate's style for less we've found some pretty prints that will do the trick.

L.K. Bennett's 'Rosa' dress is a dead ringer for the Erdem original or check out Coast and Marks and Spencer for similar styles. If the Duchess is dressing for spring then we've all got the royal seal of approval.

She looked remarkably svelte, displaying her neat baby bump in the £995 Erdem dress, which is not designed for pregnant women, as she left the lunchtime reception at the five-star Goring Hotel.

Kate's lunchtime foray was not part of her official schedule and, according to Kensington Palace, the 33-year-old was attending in a private capacity, having received a personal invitation from the hotel. 

Today's visit is far from being the first time that the Duchess has spent time at the Goring. Last December, the hotel was the venue for a meeting of the board of the 1851 Trust, the sailing charity of which the Duchess is patron.

She also stayed in the hotel, which is situated across the road from Buckingham Palace, in the run-up to the 2011 Royal Wedding along with her parents and siblings Pippa and James.

Other royals to love the London hotel include the Queen Mother who apparently considered it her favourite and used the Goring, which first opened its doors in 1910, as the venue for her last public appearance in 2002.

Today's visit to the Goring Hotel was the Duchess' first public outing in two weeks, with her last official visit coming when she travelled to the Potteries in Stoke-on-Trent to tour the Emma Bridgewater factory.

During that trip, during which she  wore a Seraphine dress, a SportMax coat and her trademark £395 Jimmy Choo satin shoes, the Duchess tried her hand at making plates and was declared a natural by local potters.

She also used the occasion to visit the Action for Children Cape Hill Children's Centre in Smethwick, where she joined a group of youngsters who were trying their hand at crafts courtesy of a couple of old tin cans and some colourful feathers.

The Duchess, an art fan herself, promptly rolled up her sleeves and got stuck in before declaring, as she made her way back to her waiting car: 'George would have loved this!' 

Prince George's father, the Duke of Cambridge, is currently touring China and spent his second evening in the country making a speech in Shanghai, following a historic meeting with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing.

President Xi, who is part of the Communist party leadership  once dubbed 'appalling old waxworks' by the Prince of Wales, gave William a warm welcome and also heaped praise on the rest of the Royal Family.

The two men met in the imposing Great Hall of the People - home to the Chinese Congress - where the president talked of the royals' interest in his country and the positive contribution they have made to the relationship between China and the UK.

Despite Prince Philip writing off Beijing as 'ghastly' during his 1986 royal tour of China, President Xi as also extended an open invitation to the Queen and her family, which, according to commentators, could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne.

Afterwards, the Duke was driven to the Forbidden City, an imperial palace that was used by both Ming and Qing dynasties and takes up more than 180 acres of central Beijing.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, construction on the palace complex began in 1406 and it later became home to 25 different emperors as well as the spot where the last Emperor of China, Puyi, abdicated in 1912. 

The Duke then flew out of Beijing and on to the coastal city - and former British stronghold - of Shanghai, where he helped launch the GREAT Festival of Creativity, a government-inspired scheme intended to promote British business.

Speech: The Duke spoke of the close links between the UK and China and his hope that the collaboration will continue in future

Innovation: He took the opportunity to speak about Britain's innovation in film, art and the media but also in education and healthcare

Colourful: The scene as the Duke arrived at the business festival was a colourful one thanks to the presence of flag waving dancers

In a speech made at the event, William described the festival as 'a showcase and celebration of the creative strength of the British economy and the ingenuity of the British people.'

'It is a platform not only for our famed and still thriving creative sectors, such as film, art and media,' he continued. 'But it is also a platform for the creativity and inventiveness that British firms apply in a wide variety of sectors, like healthcare and education.'

The Duke also took the opportunity thank President Xi for his 'warm welcome' and put his knowledge of Mandarin to use, opening the speech with 'Nushimen, Xianshengmen, wan shang hao' which translates as 'Ladies and gentlemen, good evening'.

'This is my first time in China,' he added. 'But less than 24 hours into my first visit, I have a strong sense of the opportunity that exists for collaboration and partnership between our two countries.

'This morning in Beijing as I was warmly welcomed by President Xi in the Great Hall of the People before visiting the Forbidden City, I was given the chance to appreciate first-hand that China and Britain are united in our experience as countries with a proud and ancient history.'

William's visit, which comes immediately after a four-day trip to Japan, will continue for another two days with the Duke due to see more of Shanghai and the southern city of Jinghong before flying home.

Meeting the locals: William visited the Shija Hutong Museum where he was introduced to vulnerable children being helped by Chinese charities
