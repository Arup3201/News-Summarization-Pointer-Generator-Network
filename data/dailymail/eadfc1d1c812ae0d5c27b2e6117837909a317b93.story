More details have emerged about a bizarre and malicious assault incident at Boston airport at the weekend, in which a 26-year-old Harvard student fell into a women's bathroom naked through the ceiling before running into the hallway and biting the ear off an elderly man.

Cameron Shenk was arraigned Wednesday on charges that include attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct. 

The economics student at Harvard Extension School, who has no history of mental illness, allegedly took his clothes off, crawled into the ceiling, fell and then assaulted three people - the 84-year-old man and two troopers.

Outside court his father offered a cryptic explanation for his son's wild behavior, suggesting Shenk may have been under the influence of something, according to WHDH.

Refused bail: Cameron Shenk, 26, appears at his arraignment at East Boston Municipal Court on Wednesday on charges that include attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct

Bizarre behavior: Police say the 26-year-old Shenk fell through the ceiling of a women's bathroom at Boston's Logan airport at about noon Saturday

Stripped off: He had allegedly sneaked into the bathroom, undressed inside a stall and climbed into the ceiling crawl space. Police say he then fled the bathroom and assaulted an 84-year-old man

'Dangerous': He has been ordered held without bail pending a hearing next week

Derek Shenk, who flew into Boston to appear at his son's arraignment, said afterwards: 'It was a singular event. The best analogy that I can say is that we could all learn a lot from Snow White. If you're given an apple, sometimes it really does contain poison.'

It is unclear exactly what Mr Shenk was alluding to with his analogy.

Cameron Shenk accessed the roof by sneaking into the women's bathroom about noon on Saturday.

After stripping, he climbed up into a crawl space, but the roof gave way and he fell back down.

Police say he then fled the bathroom and ran into the 84-year-old bystander in the hallway.

'And (he) began choking that man with his cane,' prosecutor Emily Hamrock said in court Wednesday.

'JetBlue employees came when they heard the commotion and tried to break up the incident and in the process this defendant leaned in and bit off a large part of that elderly man's ear.'

Shenk was finally subdued by two troopers, but allegedly assaulted both in the process while trying to fight them off.

Shenk was naked and bleeding at the time. 

'He is truly remorseful about what happened here, particularly with regard to the gentleman who was injured as a result of his conduct,' Shenk's lawyer, Frank O'Brien, told  

Shenk was has been ordered held without bail.

A hearing to determine whether he is dangerous to the public is scheduled Monday.

The elderly victim is still recovering from the attack.

Shenk was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital following the incident.
