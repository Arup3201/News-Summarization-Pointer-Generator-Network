The cast and crew of axed BBC drama Ripper Street were today filming the show's third series after the Victorian costume drama was saved by online giant Amazon.

The show, set in London's Whitechapel in 1889 - six months after the gruesome Jack The Ripper Murders, was axed by the BBC at the end of last year due to poor viewing figures.

There were also some issues with sound -  with dozens of viewers complaining to the BBC about  'meaningless mumbling' throughout the second series.

On set: The cast and crew of Ripper Street, which was axed by the BBC last year before being saved by Amazon, was being filmed in Dublin today. Pictured is Jerome Flynn - or Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake - getting ready for a scene

Action: Jerome Flynn sits on a bench as two child actors make their way towards him during filming. The show was dropped by the BBC in December 2013 after the second series attracted poor ratings

Takes: The actor, best known for appearing in hit HBO series Game of Thrones, chats to one of the members of crew during a blustery day of filming. Amazon announced it would be funding the show in February

But thankfully for fans, it was saved by online retailer Amazon - who have funded the third series along with production company Tiger Aspect.

It will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFilLM - in the autumn before being shown on BBC One a few months later.

And, if today's pictures are anything to go by, filming for the latest series - which will see the return of crime-fighting duo Matthew Macfadyen and Jerome Flynn - appears to be going swimmingly.

Jerome Flynn - or Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake as he is known in the show - could be seen milling about on locations in full costume, chatting to numerous members of cast and crew.

Happy to be on set: The actor embraces a female friend during filming. The third series of Ripper Street will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFiLM - in autumn

Matthew Macfadyen, or Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, was also on location today - dressed in full Victorian costume. The show will be shown on the BBC a few months after it airs on the Amazon service

Hungry work! Matthew Macfadyen popped out of his trailer for a spot of lunch at one point in the day. Amazon's decision to fund the series was the first time an on-demand service had taken on a show after it was dropped

Fed: The Spooks actor later left his trailer - no doubt for a hard afternoon's filming

Meanwhile, in one series of pictures, Matthew Macfadyen - who plays Detective Inspector Edmund Reid - could be seen dashing out of his trailer to get a spot of lunch.

Elsewhere, groups of ladies were battling the elements - holding down their skirts in blustery conditions.

Amazon decision to save the gruesome Victorian drama marked the first time an on-demand video service stepped in to fund a drama series after it was dropped by a broadcaster.

Following the announcement in February, BBC drama boss Ben Stephenson said the deal was 'an exceptional opportunity' to bring the show back - while freeing up BBC money for new drama series.

Tiger
Aspect’s Head of Drama, Will Gould added: 'In the past year we’ve transmitted
two series of Ripper Street in the UK, had highs of eight million viewers, sold
the show to over 150 countries, got Bafta nominated and voted Radio Times best
show of the year, were cancelled and resurrected.

Cast: Scores of extras - including this gentleman with an rather large beard - joined the main characters on set today for the day of filming. The U.S. version of the show will be filmed and funded by BBC America

Waiting around: Crew members take a break during filming. When the Amazon takeover was announced, BBC drama boss Ben Stephenson said the deal was an 'exceptional opportunity' for the show

Do like to be beside the seaside! Actors line up with donkeys during filming. The series, set in London's East End in 1889, will see a return of all of the series's best-loved characters

Drama: Two actresses make their way across the sand in windy conditions on set today

Conditions: A lady holds on to her hat while an actor braces himself as a cold gust of wind blows past

'We’re incredibly grateful
to Amazon Prime Instant Video and BBC Worldwide for helping us continue telling
the Ripper story in such a unique, unprecedented way, and for the BBC for their
continued support.

'And of course we’re indebted to our incredible fans that
have been so vocal and passionate and spurred us on. The third series promises
to be the best yet.'

On-demand services commissioning their own series is not a new phenomenon, however.

Netflix has now successfully produced six series - including Lilyhammer, House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.

Windy? Some of the ladies struggled with their dresses as the wind whipped around them

Protection: Even Jerome Flynn struggled with the weather - putting up an umbrella to shelter under

As it was: Jerome Flynn, Matthew Macfadyen and Adam Rothenbergh in the pilot episode of the series

#It has also produced three series for children, along with numerous specials, mini-series and films.

In a recent interview with the Guardian, Neil Hunt, Chief Product Officer for Netflix, said they would continue to make more originals following the popularity of their previous offerings.

He told the newspaper: 'I think we are going to end up doing a lot more originals over time.

'The world of internet TV kind of means that not all shows have to be 13 episodes times 42 minutes. That's a new freedom.'

The company, founded in 1997, has 48 million subscribers worldwide.
