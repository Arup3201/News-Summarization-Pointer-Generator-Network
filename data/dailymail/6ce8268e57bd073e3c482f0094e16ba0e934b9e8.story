Sainsbury's today dumped plans for dozens of new superstores after it announced pre-tax losses of £290million in the last six months and warned they may be squeezed for years. 

Britain's third biggest chain, behind Asda and Tesco, said today it needs to respond to changing shopping habits.

Customers have been flocking to discounters like Lidl and Aldi, smaller convenience stores or shopping online.

In the face of its worst results for a decade the supermarket giant admitted it needs to improve the quality of 3,000 own-brand products and would invest £150million in cutting its prices. 

Struggling: Sainsbury's reported pre-tax losses of £290m for the past six months as it said it would launch a price war to win back customers

The cost of writing down the value of existing stores and those sites which will no longer be developed meant the supermarket giant plunged to a loss of £290million in the six months to September 27. 

New chief executive Mike Coupe, who replaced Justin King over the summer, said Britain's grocery market is going through a 'once-in-a-generation' transformation - and Sainbury's needs to cut prices to compete.

He told Sky News: 'We've had one of the most challenging market conditions I've seen in my 30-year career; a culmination of structural change in our industry, customers shopping more frequently.

'A period of deflation, which happens once every 10 years but actually fantastic for customers, so customers are seeing prices coming down'.

But despite the change in habits he does not believe it is the end for superstores. 

The retailer said its underlying profits for the six months to September 27 were 6.3 per cent lower at £375 million in the 28 weeks to September 27 - compared to £433million in the same period last year. 

But it had to write-off £628million from the value of its existing supermarkets and because of its mothballed developments. 

The ultra-competitive market means it expects its like-for-like sales to fall over 'the next few years' after reporting a 2.1 per cent drop in the period.

And it warned its second half profits were likely to be worse.

The company said: 'The grocery sector is undergoing structural change as customers shop more frequently, using online, convenience and discount channels more.

'We expect supermarket like-for-like sales in the sector to be negative for the next few years, but we have robust plans to address this challenge.' 

A new price comparison survey by the Grocer magazine has found the cheapest basket of food is available at Aldi. 

The budget chain is significantly cheaper than more established rivals, the publication said.

A basket of 33 commonly bought items was £38.19 at Aldi. Asda was the next best at £45.26, which is some £7.07 or 18.5per cent more expensive.

The equivalent basket was £49.87 at Tesco, £50.08 at Morrisons, and £52.41 at Sainsbury’s.

Morrisons has tried to counter the threat posed by Aldi by being the first supermarket to launch a loyalty card scheme that promises to refund the price difference in the form vouchers.

Tesco and Sainsbury’s also offer vouchers where one of their mainstream rivals – other than Aldi and Lidl – are cheaper.

Waitrose is one of the few mainstream food companies, along with Marks & Spencer, to be putting on sales. 

Its basket of 33 items came in at £56.19, which is £18 or 47per cent more expensive than Aldi.

The prices for Lidl were not included in the study however, it tries to match the figures charged by Aldi.

The Grocer magazine was not able to make an exact like for like comparison, however the products were as close as it could find.

It said: ‘Asda is working hard to close the gap. Morrisons has promised to refund the difference via vouchers. But on the evidence of Aldi’s first guest appearance in The Grocer 33, the big four are still trailing in its wake.

‘Virtually all products this week - 30 out of 33 - were cheapest at Aldi - 25 exclusively so. The biggest savings were on meat products, with £1.99 gammon steaks and £1.07 sausage rolls, respectively 81p and 53p cheaper than elsewhere.’

The Grocer added: ‘It is the margin of difference to Aldi that is furrowing brows … When it comes to basics, it’s elementary: Aldi is way cheaper.’
