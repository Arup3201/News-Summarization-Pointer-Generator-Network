For years we’ve been told oysters are the food of love, and that red meat may be an aphrodisiac.

Now the animal rights charity PETA is arguing that fruit and veg are the key to virility – and has released a bizarre video on YouTube to back up the point. 

The clip has been released in honour of World Vegan Day to flag up the sexual health benefits of men going vegan.

SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO

In its bizarre new video, the animal rights charity PETA highlights that fruit and veg are the key to virility

It features various men gyrating with an assortment of phallic-shaped fruit and vegetables as their manhood, accompanied by phrases such as ‘a cucumber has never looked so good – or so wicked’. 

From a tennis player sporting a giant carrot, to a car wash mechanic with a banana, PETA says the video is ‘a light-hearted way to show that spicing things up in the bedroom can be as simple as changing things up in the kitchen’. 

The charity maintains that cholesterol in meat, eggs and dairy products can clog our arteries and slow the flow of blood to all the body's organs – including those that are vital in the bedroom.

Vegan meals, on the other hand, contain none of the animal fat or cholesterol found in meat, eggs and dairy products.

Vegans are also, on average, fitter and slimmer than meat-eaters and less prone to heart disease, strokes, diabetes, obesity and cancer, the charity claims. 

'When it comes to making love, carnivores can be as sluggish as the blood trying to squeeze through their clogged arteries – but vegans have the stamina to keep the party going all night long,’ said PETA UK associate director Mimi Bekhechi.
