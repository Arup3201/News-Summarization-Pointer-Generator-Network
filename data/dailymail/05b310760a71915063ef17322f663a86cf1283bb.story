Atletico Madrid are pressing Manchester City to sell Alvaro Negredo but the Premier League champions have insisted he is not for sale.

Atletico have already had an initial enquiry discussing a £16.5m offer rejected but believe, via intermediaries, that City may be tempted if they increase their bid to around £26m.

Chelsea are to complete the protracted transfer of Diego Costa after confirming they have triggered the Atletico Madrid striker’s £32million buy-out clause.

Costa's teammate Tiago Mendes has agreed a two year deal with Chelsea on a free while Mourinho is also trying to sign Atletico left-back Filipe Luis, who will cost close to £20million.

Atletico want to loan Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku, who is wanted by Everton and Tottenham, and have an interest in Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster with Thibaut Courtois expected to return to Chelsea.

Negredo, who is on holiday in Ibiza, is understood to be unsettled after losing his place to Edin Dzeko at the end of last season.
