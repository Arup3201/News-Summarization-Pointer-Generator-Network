They say actors have to be like chameleons to play different characters.

But these lizards have turned that on its head - proving their acting skills by showing off their best Titanic impersonation.

The creative duo played the part of main characters Jack and Rose by carefully holding onto one another while balancing on the end of a stick.

Keen photographer Katja Jentschura 
captured the moment one chameleon places its hands on the other's waist.
 'Kate' then stretches its arms out in a pose  its human counterpart Winslet would perhaps
 be
 proud of.

She photographed the comic chameleons while she was visiting a friend's house in Berlin, Germany.

A fan of James Cameron movies, she saw the scene unfolding and immediately used her camera to snap the entertaining shot.

She added: 'I could immediately see the Titanic scene and will now always have it in mind when I look at the photo.

'I like reptiles and I think chameleons are astounding creatures.

'They are also fun to observe and I think they have many comical expressions.'
