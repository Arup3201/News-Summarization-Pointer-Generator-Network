Military chiefs are fighting to save the grave of a First World War soldier called Private Ryan after a giant sinkhole opened up in a cemetery.

The body of the serviceman who died aged 40 has been lost after the 20ft deep hole appeared in the spot where his body was laid to rest.

Private Francis Ryan, who served in the 3rd Battalion, King's Liverpool Regiment, died in England in July 1915.

Final resting place: Private Ryan's grave has lain undisturbed in the corner of this cemetery for nearly a century after he died in England during the First World War in 1915

Recovery: The sinkhole in Pembroke Dock Military Cemetery is going to be filled up with grout to stop the headstone being lost

His army unit never served on the frontline during the First World War, and it is thought the serviceman may have died after an accident during a training exercise.

Officials have so far been unable to trace relatives of the army volunteer - and only limited records about Private Ryan remain.

His body had lain undisturbed in a quiet corner of a cemetery in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, underneath a Scots Pine for nearly a century after his death in England.

But a 20ft-deep sinkhole has now swallowed up the spot where his coffin lay - leaving his military headstone teetering on the edge.

A team of Ministry of Defence officials are now battling to rescue Private Ryan’s remains ready for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War in August.

Pembroke Dock district Parade Marshal David Boswell said: 'The graveyard is a monument to the Army, Navy and Artillery stationed here during the First World War.

'But unfortunately Mother Nature has taken over and when she opens up her body there is not much you can do.

'It’s a shame it’s happened but the MoD have looked into it and are trying to restore the grave to its original condition as soon as possible.

'This is the only military cemetery in Wales so it will be nice to have it re-opened and ready for the centenary of the First World War.

'We will be holding a service of remembrance in August to mark the centenary and it will be nice to have the cemetery back to its best so we can remember our fallen.'

The MoD has so far failed to trace a living relative of Private Ryan - who was born in Longford, Ireland, in 1875.

He died aged 40 on July 23, 1915, while serving in the reserve 3rd Battalion, Kings Liverpool Regiment, and stationed in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. His soldier number was 3/10511.

The 6ft-wide and 20ft-deep sinkhole has left a gaping circular hole in the ground with only rocks and tree roots visible to visitors of the war cemetery.

Final resting place: The sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan's grave - and his remains are hidden beneath the fallen mud and rubble

Five other military graves are in danger beside the sinkhole with the names J O’Brien, Private J McGuiness, Gunner William Henry Hurley, Private Charles Joseph Duffy and Private E Sullivan.

The cemetery is the final resting place for 23 Commonwealth service personnel from the First World War and 51 from the Second World War.

It was closed for several months until a protective metal fence was erected around the six 'at risk' graves last week.

The sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan’s grave - and his remains are hidden beneath the fallen mud and rubble.

An MoD spokeswoman said they want to avoid exhuming Private Ryan and plan to fill the sinkhole with grout mixture to stop his headstone falling in.

She said: 'Work to fill in the sink hole is due to begin this week and is expected to be completed by the end of March.

'The chosen option does not involve any exhumation and the MoD is confident that work will be effective.

'However in the extremely unlikely event that the option chosen is not effective the MOD will have to consider other options some of which may involve exhumation.

'We are in the process of trying to locate relatives of those buried in affected plots.

'But it is believed the graves date back to the early part of the 20th century so it may be difficult to trace any descendants.'
