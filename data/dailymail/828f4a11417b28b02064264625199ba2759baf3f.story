The next generation: A picture of a youngster posing with a toy gun in front of an ISIS flag. It was tweeted by Londoner Umm Khattab, the teenaged widow of an ISIS fighter

The 18-year-old British widow of an ISIS fighter killed fighting in Syria has tweeted a picture of a young boy clutching a toy gun in front of the black flag of the terror group.

The image was posted by Umm Khattab, believed to be from London, with the caption: 'Next generation, Bi'ithnillah (God willing).

Last week it was reported that British Muslim extremists are offering teenage girls in the UK money to marry Islamic State militants waging bloody jihad in Syria and Iraq. 

Supporters of the terror group are believed to be offering cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters.

Although the boy, who appears to be aged about four, is not likely to be Khatab's son, his mother could be Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, from Lewisham in south London, who left Britain to join ISIS and is married to Swedish terrorist Abu Bakr.

The pair are believed to live in Manjib, northern Syria, along with other British jihadi brides.

The teenager also posted pictures of the food she receives, such as pizza and chocolate cakes, because of her status as the widow of a 'shaheed', or martyr. Her youth is evident in the three 'smiley' emoticons she places at the end of the tweet.

Khattab, whose husband died in the war-torn town of Kobane on the border of Syria and Turkey, also tweeted a picture of foods from Kobane, including a drink from Starbucks, reports The Sunday Times.

It is understood that ISIS channels money for the would-be jihadis' payment and travel expenses through international money wire systems, enabling the group's UK cell to offer significant sums of cash to disenfranchised teenagers, many of whom are from poverty-stricken backgrounds.

The whole grooming process operates using the same techniques of trust-building and reward-offering employed by sexual predators, and is designed to turn the teenage girls into jihadi brides. 

News of ISIS' secret teenage terror trade was revealed in The Times, following a three month investigation by the newspaper in which reporters posed as two schoolgirls.

It exposes how vulnerable young British Muslims are to ISIS' chilling network or groomers - and reveals that police are taking seriously the idea that the terror group has already provided money and travel assistance to children under the age of 16.

Posing as Aisha, a 17-year-old girl from East London, the reporters - who have not been named for their own safety - were swamped with approaches from ISIS sympathisers, and were eventually put in touch with an alleged Syria-based extremist of Lebanese origin named Abu Abbas al-Lubnani.

Grooming: Islamic State supporters are believed to be using British intermediaries to offer cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters

Having built something of a rapport with the jihadi - including getting him to prove his authenticity by asking him to send photos taken in Raqqa with a banner reading 'Aisha' - al-Lubnani then offered to introduce 'Aisha' to a British intermediary, who would then pay for her to travel to the Islamic State.

A surveillance operation followed, in which investigators identified a white British Muslim convert as the prime candidate for being the UK-based jihadi who offered to pay for two girls to travel to Syria. 

The man reportedly also offered intensive coaching on how the girls could avoid drawing attention to themselves before and during their journey to the Middle East.

Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey and went on to Syria

Police in Britain have been urging families to contact them if they believe their loved-ones are trying to leave for Syria so they can be stopped.

Detectives say young women are being manipulated online with glamorous descriptions of life in Syria with ISIS, only to suffer a miserable existence when they arrive.

Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey.

She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl Samya Dirie, who she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters.

Police failed to stop schoolgirl Miss Dirie despite being told she had run away with her passport.

Three hours after her panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey.

Her exit may have prompted the urgent response in the latest Heathrow case.

In June 'terror twins' Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married in the war-torn nation since disappearing overnight from their home.

Both have insisted that Allah had 'chosen' for them to be in Syria.

The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet.

Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. 

Bodies of Islamic State militants killed during fighting in Koban, Iraq were photographed this morning

Details of the investigation came after it was revealed that police stopped a plane at Heathrow just seconds before it was due to take off because a 15-year-old girl on board was planning to fly to Turkey before continuing her journey on to join ISIS militants in Syria.

The young girl had secretly saved up to buy a ticket from London to Istanbul and planned to continue her journey through Turkey and over the border into Syria. It appears it was treated as a missing person's inquiry and she was not arrested.

Her family, who had no idea she harboured extremist views, reported her missing and Scotland Yard tracked her down to a passenger jet about to leave Britain.

After rushing to Heathrow, officers realised the girl's plane was already taxiing along the runway, so the pilot was ordered to stop and the girl  taken home.

It later emerged that a second British 15-year-old girl was not spotted on board and was able to continue her journey to join the Islamic State in Syria.

A United Nations official says one of the two Austrian girls who fled their middle class homes in Vienna earlier this year to fight in Syria has definitely died in the conflict.

The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic, 17, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic, whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria. 

They first went to the Turkish capital Ankara by plane, and then on into the southern Turkish region of Adana. After that, their tracks were lost.

But they appeared on social networking sites branding Kalashnikov rifles and surrounded by armed men - photos which Austrian police said acted as recruitment posters for young girls.

David Scharia, a senior Israeli expert of the United Nations Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTED) said: 'We received information just recently about two 15-year-old girls, of Bosnian origin, who left Austria, where they had been living in recent years; and everyone, the families and the intelligence services of the two countries, is looking for them. 

He added: 'Both were recruited by Islamic State. One was killed in the fighting in Syria, the other has disappeared.'

His confirmation comes three months after the Austrian government said it had informed both sets of parents of the girls that one of them might have been killed.
