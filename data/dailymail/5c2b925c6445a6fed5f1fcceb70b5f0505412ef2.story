Many people are waiting to find out what Kate and William's baby will be called before naming their own

The birth of the most eagerly anticipated baby of the decade is just days away and the world is waiting with baited breath.

But while the royal baby is yet to be born - let alone named - he or she is already influencing baby name choices on a wider scale as  traditionally royal monikers see a rise in popularity.

A new survey reveals that 22 per cent of expectant parents are taking inspiration from the excitement of the impending royal babies and are strongly considering naming their child after Royals from over the years, with Harry and Sophie topping the list as the two of the most popular names.

The study asked over 2,000 expectant parents-to-be whether or not they had planned a name with any kind of Royal connotation for their unborn child, to which just over a fifth of the parents taking part said they had.

These respondents were then asked to state what these Royal names were, revealing the top five most popular Royal names amongst expectant parents for their unborn children as Harry, William and Charles for boys and Sophie, Kate and Elizabeth for little girls.

Respondents were asked if they believe 
that the recent buzz surrounding the upcoming royal births sparked their
desire to want a more traditional first or middle name for their child. Eighty two per cent agreed with this statement. 

82 per cent of people surveyed said that the buzz around the Royal births had a huge effect on their baby name choices

George Charles of VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'I must say, the result of this study 
really surprised us, especially with the 
recent trend of celebrities favouring more obscure names for their 
children such as Blue Ivy, Apple, Harper Seven, Suri and North.

'It seems
that this celebrity obscurity doesn’t hold as much sway nowadays, and we 
Britons are looking to keep things traditional and follow in Royal 
footsteps!

Harry and William topped the poll for most popular baby boy's names, with 22 per cent and 16 per cent of the votes respectively

The favourite girls' names were Sophie, a nod to the Countess of Wessex, and Kate - after the nation's favourite duchess

'I don’t mean to sound like too much of a
Katie Hopkins here, but the fact is that every parent wants their child
to go on and do great things, and may feel that a strong regal name 
will help them achieve these things.

'We certainly can’t wait to see what
both impending royal babies will be named - and it will definitely be 
interesting to see if the chosen names make expectant parents change 
their minds.'

Another recent survey found a record numbers of newborn babies are expected to go unnamed this month as parents across the country wait to discover the name chosen by the royal couple.

Parents are given six weeks to register their baby's name and that means thousands are expected to pause for thought until they hear the news from Clarence House.

Experts believe that thousands of couples are likely to find inspiration in the choice of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and follow suit.

Netvouchercodes.co.uk found more than ten per cent  of respondents in their survey of expectant mothers said they were hoping to postpone having to name their offspring until they heard the royal name.

'My baby is due before the royal baby, but I already know I definitely want it to have the same name,' one said. 'The birth of Will and Kate's baby is such a monumental event that is going to be remembered forever, just like the royal wedding. Giving my baby the same name is my personal way of celebrating.'
