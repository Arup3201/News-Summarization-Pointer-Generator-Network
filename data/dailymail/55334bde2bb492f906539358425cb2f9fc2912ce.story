The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola said she will demand £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur.

Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract the disease while she was caring for a missionary.

But she said the worst part of her ordeal was leaning her mixed breed dog had been put down, claiming 'he was not given a chance'.

Lawyers for Mrs Romero say the decision to put the animal down last month as she battled the killer disease was 'improvised and taken against medical advice'.

Health chiefs in Madrid obtained a court order to sacrifice Excalibur despite an online petition to save it signed by more than 300,000 people.

Riot police clashed with protestors outside her home near Madrid so they could take the animal away to incinerate it.

As well as demanding compensation for her dog through the courts, the nurse is also planning to sue Madrid health chief Javier Rodriguez for defamation.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against officials' decision to put the animal down without testing to see whether it was infected first

While Teresa was battling to save her life he accused her of hiding information from the doctors who treated her before she was admitted to hospital.

He also claimed she could have contracted the Ebola virus by not following protocol.

Amid controversy over the training given to health professionals treating the two Spanish missionaries with the disease he claimed on TV: 'You don't need a Masters degree to explain to someone how to put on or take off a suit.'

He went on to apologise after Teresa and her husband demanded his resignation.

Speaking about her recovery, Mrs Romero said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.'

Mrs Romero caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone.

Ms Romero's husband Javier  has also questioned the decision to put the animal down saying he was not to blame 'for anything'

Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. 

She was quarantined along with 14 other people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared.

However the decision by Spanish authorities to put down her dog, Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected caused widespread protests.

At a news conference, her husband Javier questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'.

He also described the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision.

In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released.

Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8. 

Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name.

One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo.
