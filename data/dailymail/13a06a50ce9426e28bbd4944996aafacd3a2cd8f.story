Charities in Scotland are being handed a far larger slice of lottery money than English ones, it has emerged.

Projects north of the border receive nearly three times as much cash per head of population – £25.27 compared to the £9.46 awarded in England.

The money has been used to fund controversial Scottish projects such as ‘gay propaganda’ DVDs for schools, camcorders for asylum seekers and a ‘groovy’ diversity parade.

Thousands have also been spent on dressmaking lessons exclusively for Scots from ethnic minorities, and on ‘educating’ Scottish householders about renewable energy.

The Big Lottery Fund – the quango that allocates lottery money – dedicated £134million last year to projects in Scotland and £501million to English ones despite England’s population being ten times larger.

Critics said the disparity was just another example of the way those south of the border get far less money showered on them by public bodies than those to the north.

Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said the ‘outdated’ Barnett formula – the mechanism by which the Treasury divides spending between the home nations – already meant that ‘significantly more taxpayers’ money’ goes to Scotland.

‘This Big Lottery Fund money is simply adding to the distortion,’ he said.

‘People will wonder how that distribution can possibly be fair, as most would have thought that all parts of the United Kingdom were benefiting equally.’

Wales and Northern Ireland also did far better than England in terms of Big Lottery Fund spending – with the Welsh getting £13.49 per head and the Northen Irish £31.33.

The fund said the disparity between England and Scotland was an exception, but analysis of previous years shows England consistently receives less money per head than the other home nations.

Spending plans also show that Scotland is due to get a larger proportion of cash than England until at least 2015.

Lucky help: The Big Lottery Fund is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the National Lottery

The Big Lottery Fund makes grants to projects working in health, education and the environment; and most of its money goes to charities. It is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the National Lottery, and says it distributes its cash based on both population size and indices of deprivation.

The organisation’s annual report reveals that this means that projects from the three smaller nations of the United Kingdom are far more likely to benefit.

In Scotland, for example, £10million was set aside to address ‘hardship which has sent people to food banks and community clothing centres’, £6.5million to tackle domestic abuse and £8million to provide safe housing to victims of such abuse.

In 2012/13, England received 7,600 awards totalling £501million, Scotland received 3,122 awards totalling £134million, Wales got 950 totalling £41million and Northern Ireland 833 totalling £57million.

As well as having separate pots for the four nations, the annual report reveals that  there is a £44.7million fund for 323 UK-wide projects. It is not known how this is distributed.

Previous reports show that the disparity in per capita spending has persisted.

In 2011/12, England received £9.25 per head, compared to £14.51 in Scotland, £16.05 in Wales and £12.54 in Northern Ireland.

In 2010/11, England received £3.74 per head, Scotland £4.59, Wales £11.54 and Northern Ireland £3.78.

And in 2009/10, England got £4.90 per head compared to £11.67 in Scotland, £10.45 in Wales and £18.77 in Northern Ireland.

A spokesman for the Big Lottery Fund said: ‘The focus of our grants is on people and communities  most in need. As a result the allocation of grant budget by each country is based on both population size and indices of deprivation.

‘Grant budgets, including a  separate UK-wide budget, are allocated over a six-year period and vary greatly from year to year depending on programmes open  for applications. No single year should be considered in isolation  as this will not provide a true comparison.

‘For example, the Scotland  allocation this year includes a one-off, £49million award to the Life Changes Trust.’
