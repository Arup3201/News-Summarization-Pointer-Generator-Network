Dining  1,000ft above the ground with views of the snow-covered Alps may seem like something out of a dream.

Yet for 40 lucky tourists, this is what will be offered at the Paradiski ski area in France when the Venoise Express, one of the world's biggest, longest and fastest cable cars, transforms into a luxury pop-up restaurant.

During a two-hour gourmet dinner, diners will be suspended at an altitude of 5,740feet, 1,250ft  above the ground and will enjoy a panoramic view over the snow-covered Alps.

The cable car travels between the mountains of the Les Arcs/Peisey-Vallandry and La Plagne ski resorts.

The special meal will be the prize for 40 selected tourists on February 12 - taking high dining to a new level

French chef Stéphane Froidevaux, whose restaurant L'Antidote in Serre Chevalier is Michelin starred, will prepare the menu. 

The exact location will be at the heart of the Ponthurin Valley, between the mountains of the Les Arcs/Peisey-Vallandry and La Plagne ski resorts.

Those who are in with a chance will be skiers who declare interest in the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity when buying a Paradiski lift pass between February 7 and 10. The meal will be served on February 12.

The Vanoise Express  links the ski areas of Les Arcs and La Plagne. 

Opened in 2003, the lift can carry 2000 people per hour in its two huge double-decker cable cars. 

Travelling at a speed of 8mph, it only takes four minutes to span the 1.5 miles between Plan Peisey  and Les Coches and when it first opened, it was the biggest, longest and fastest cable car in the world.

The lift system cost a whopping £12million to build. 

Each car can hold a maximum of 200 people (over two levels) and they run independently of each other on two separate cables.
