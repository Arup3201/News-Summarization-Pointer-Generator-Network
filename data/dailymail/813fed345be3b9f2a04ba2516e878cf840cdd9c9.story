Equal terms: Rachida Dati says if women's sex lives should be exposed so should men's

France's first woman justice minister today called for the 'quadruple, triple' sex lives of the nation's male politicians to be exposed.

Rachida Dati, 46, was speaking out after what she described as 'shameful' revelations about the romantic life of the country's first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, 47.

This week it emerged that Ms Trierweiler was once the shared mistress of future Socialist president Francois Hollande, and conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, a right-wing conservative.

Not only was Ms Trierweiler married at the time, but so was Mr Devedjian, and Mr Hollande was living with the mother of his four children.

Now Ms Dati, whose own colourful romantic history was frequently raised when she was justice minister between 2007 and 2009, said high-profile women involved in adulterous affairs were treated unfairly.

'I think it's shameful what's done and what's been written about Valerie Trierweiler,' she told Europe 1 radio station.

'Why not disclose the quadruple, triple lives of certain politicians, of some bosses who do not behave well with women or who sometimes behave in a manner which is very loose?'

Ms Dati, who is single, last month launched legal proceedings to make a casino tycoon acknowledge he is the father of her love child.

Dominique Desseigne, the 68-year-old chief of the Lucien Barriere group, received a demand for 'recognition of paternity' for her daughter Zohra, born on January 2, 2009.

When Ms Dati pregnant in 2008, there was intense speculation as to who the father was, with suspicion even falling on then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Jose Maria Anzar, the former Spanish prime minister.

Others who figured in the frenzied guessing game, including Mr Desseigne, avoided the issue in interviews.

Miss Dati went on to cause a stir by 
giving birth by caesarean section and returning to work five days later 
in time for the announcement of a major justice reform.

The MEP and mayor of Paris's chic 7th 
arrondissement initially said claims she had filed the paternity 
proceedings were 'false' before launching into a diatribe against the 
media for violating her private life.

Scandal: Earlier this week it emerged that Valerie Trierweiler was the mistress of her partner Francois Hollande, left, and conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, right, at the same time

Ms Trierweiler has issued legal proceedings against two leading French reporters over the revelations about her life, despite the fact that she is a Paris Match magazine reporter.

Issuing her fourth privacy writ since becoming first lady in May, Ms Trierweiler said she was planning to sue the authors of the book for breaking France's strict privacy laws, and for defamation.

There was no specific denial of any of the allegations contained in a new book, La Frondeuse (The Troublemaker), but her barrister Frederique Giffard instead said it was a collection of 'author assertions backed by unproven rumours', all aimed at 'maliciously tarnishing' Ms Trierweiler and her family.

Mr Devedjian is also suing, but Mr Hollande will not be taking legal action over the book.
