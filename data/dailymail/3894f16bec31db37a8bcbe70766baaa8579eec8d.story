Jose Mourinho has revealed that he would turn down the chance to manage his native Portugal if he was given the opportunity.

Speaking to Clare Balding in a special programme for BT Sport, Mourinho also stated that he once accepted a part-time role as national team coach, but was not allowed to take it.

When quizzed over whether he would like to manage his country, Mourinho said: 'No. They tried to take me lots of times and was only one time I accepted because it was a part-time job.

'I wanted to do the same time club and national team, and at the time I wanted to accept. But my president at the time decided not to let me do the national team job.'

At that point, it was time for Mourinho to reflect, and he now believes that it would have been impossible, and unfair, to juggle both roles.

'After that I reflected and I have to agree it was not possible to do both jobs at the same time. It's not even ethical for a manager to have two jobs with so many managers without one job, it's not acceptable.'

The now-Chelsea manager has also been linked with the England managers job, but admits his wife was right to advise him to turn the role down.

Mourinho, he admits, enjoys the day-to-day running of a club too much to take a job that would only see him take charge of a handful of matches each year.

'She was right. It's too early for me. I love the day-by-day, I love to play, I love the pressure of the day-by-day, the training, the travelling, the matches, the competitiveness. 

'I remember clearly there was a moment where the next match for England would be in Paris, France v England, a friendly match. And I was already thinking about who to select, who to play, how to do it. 

'She came to me and said, "When is the next match?", "Ah the next match is in two months". "What are you doing for two months, what are you doing, what are you thinking?", she was saying, "Forget it, it's not for you, maybe in 20 years.'
