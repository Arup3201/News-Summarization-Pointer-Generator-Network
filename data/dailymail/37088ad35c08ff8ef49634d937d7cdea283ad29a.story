Scientists have discovered that it’s possible to hear the sound of coral reefs perishing.

At their brightest and most vibrant, coral reefs are among the noisiest environments on the planet and a healthy reef can be heard by sea creatures - and by humans using underwater microphones - from several miles away.

Now experts have recorded the more muted sound of a dying reef, as resident fish and crabs fight for their survival.

Researchers from two British universities believe that human activities such as over-fishing drive away marine life so reefs are quieter.

This has a huge impact on the fish and invertebrates that rely on the underwater habitat for their home and food.

Dr Julius Piercy, from the University of Essex, led the study, which involved taking acoustic recordings of coral reefs with different levels of protection around islands in the Philippines.

The research found that the noise produced by the few remaining resident fish and crustaceans on unprotected reefs was only one third of that made from bustling, healthy reef communities.

Across the world, 50 per cent of coral reefs have been destroyed in the last 30 years and the fight is on to save them.

Each year between one per cent and two per cent of world coral reefs are destroyed, largely by shoreline pollution and climate change.

Scientists think that rising air and ocean surface temperatures are causing coral bleaching and changing the chemistry of the oceans.

Warmer water stresses corals, which are incredibly sensitive to temperature.

If temperatures rise, the zooxanthellae consumed by coral as food leaves their tissue and they turn white, because the algae gives it its colour and nutrients. White coral is said to be bleached and is weak.

As carbon dioxide levels rise, more of the gas dissolves into the ocean, causing it to become more acidic - a process called acidification.

The decreasing pH means that corals can't absorb the calcium carbonate they need to maintain their skeletons and the reefs dissolve.

Last year, the Catlin Seaview Survey (CSS) teamed up with scientists around the world to create a record of the state of the world's vanishing marine habitats.

The level of noise is considered vital to the larval stages of reef fish and invertebrates, which spend the first few days of their life away from reefs and use sound as an orientation cue to find their way back.

With less sound being produced at impacted reefs, the distance over which larvae can detect habitat is ten times less.

This means that future generations could be affected, which are needed to build up and maintain healthy population levels.

Dr Piercy said: ‘In an environment where underwater noise plays such an important role in the population dynamics of coral reefs, it is alarming to find such a large effect of human impact on the natural acoustic environment.

‘This puts reef sound in the spotlight for the people who manage coral reef ecosystems because they might need to consider reef sound as an integral part of the design of marine protected area networks to ensure that there is sufficient recruitment of larvae and this study also shows sound can be useful in monitoring the health of coral reefs.’

‘With growing evidence demonstrating the direct impacts of man-made noise on aquatic life, these findings highlight additional indirect human impacts, such as over-fishing and landscape development, on natural underwater sounds.

Dr Steve Simpson, of the University of Exeter, added: ‘Taking sound recordings is a cheap, fast and objective way to get a broad idea of whether a reef is in a good condition or not.

‘It can’t replace detailed visual surveys conducted by snorkelers or divers but it gives a good account of the cryptic and nocturnal species missed in visual census and gives us a general picture of the state of coral reefs without the need for time-consuming surveys and extensive training.

‘We still know very little about what sounds these animals are listening to and it is likely to be very different between species.

‘Combined with recent findings that fish dislike the smell of impacted reefs there is a real need to understand how human impacts can indirectly affect the success of future generations of reef organisms.’

Researchers from the universities of Essex and Exeter recorded noise levels in healthy and declining reefs in the Philippines

They found that noise levels dropped by two thirds as creatures died

Healthy coral reefs are among the noisiest environments on the planet

Fish larvae use sound to find their way to reefs, but because the volume is dropping they can only detect them from short distances

This means future generations of fish could suffer and populations decline
