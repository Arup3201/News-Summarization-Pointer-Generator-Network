A giant new airport concourse has been opened in Dubai so that the Airbus A380 super-jumbos can land in the Arab country.

The opening of 20 new gates at the international airport are part of the city-state's plans for the facility to become the busiest in the world by 2015.

The first A380 touched down on January 2 but it wasn't officially opened until yesterday.

In total it is expected the project will cost nearly $8billion and the ability to land the 525-seater planes is seen as a major boost for the European Airbus consortium.

Emirates, an airline based in Dubai, currently flies 31 A380s with another 59 on order.

Dubai's growth plans are also a good 
sign for European Airbus in its rivalry with Boeing Co whose 787s have 
been grounded since mid-January as investigators examine possible 
problems with its lithium ion batteries.

During
 the first month of operations following its inaugural flight on January
 2, Concourse A has handled 461,972 pieces of luggage carried on over 
2,450 flights serving 589,234 passengers.

Tim
 Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, said: 'The full opening of 
Concourse A is a significant milestone and achievement in supporting and
 enabling the continued growth of Emirates, and our focus and commitment
 to being a leader in offering our customers innovative products and 
services that provides them with an unsurpassed travel experience.

'With a current fleet of 31 A380s and a
 further 59 on order, Emirates is the largest operator of this aircraft 
in the world, and it is only fitting that we have a world class facility
 that meets this need and represents our leadership in this regard.

Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports,
 said: 'Much like the opening of Terminal 3 in 2008, the phase in of 
Concourse A has resulted in the seamless introduction of world-class 
infrastructure that responds to the rapid growth of Emirates and caters 
to the needs of its discerning and truly global customer base.

'Concourse A is a vital element of our
 7.8 billion investment in the continued expansion of Dubai 
International which will see it become the world's busiest airport for 
international passenger traffic by the end of 2015.'

Concourse A is part of the Terminal 3 
complex built for the use of Emirates, from where its passengers can 
travel to its network of 21 A380 destinations.

With 11 floors and a total built-up 
area of 528,000 sqm, Concourse A is connected to Concourse B and 
Terminal 3 via an underground train.

Unlike any other airport facility, the
 First Class and Business Class lounges have dedicated floors that offer
 direct and access to aircraft boarding gates

The lounges, which extend the entire 
length of the concourse, are the largest in the world and offer 
customers fine dining with showcase kitchens, conference rooms, business
 centres and a Timeless Spa.

Concourse A also offers an enhanced 
duty free shopping and dining experience featuring a wide variety of 
globally recognised food and beverage brands.

Concourse A boosts capacity at Dubai 
International from 60 million to 75 million passengers per year. It is a
 vital part of Dubai Airports' 7.8 billion Strategic Plan 2020 which 
will increase airport capacity to 90 million by 2018.
