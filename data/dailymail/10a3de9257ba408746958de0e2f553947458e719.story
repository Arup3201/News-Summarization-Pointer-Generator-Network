It's back! The Daily Mail Schools Trophy returns!

With more than 80 top schools vying for the Daily Mail Schools Rugby Trophy, we think you’ll agree it is by far the best schools competition in the country.

And unlike a knockout, which tests the better team on any given day, our winners will have proved themselves over four tough months of rugby. In more than 350 Trophy matches last year, 110 ended in wins by seven points or less.

Judging by more than four million hits on schoolsrugby.co.uk, the competition was followed avidly by players, fellow pupils, parents, staff and all fans of schools rugby.

For 2014 we have have made the competition even stronger. The biggest change is to the bonus points system, which rewards schools who play higher-ranked teams. 

Last year's winners: Woodhouse Grove School from Bradford lifted the inaugural Daily Mail Schools Trophy

It was always going to be very difficult to arrive at the perfect formula for the first year and we are excited about the continued evolution of the competition.

We can’t wait for the new season to start and believe firmly the drama will match that of 2013. Let battle commence.
