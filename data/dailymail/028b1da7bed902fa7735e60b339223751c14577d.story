A former American soldier who took part in the D-Day landings has returned to Europe for the last time to visit the English village where he was stationed before the historic mission.

Bob Noody was captured in a historic photograph on his way to the front in Normandy, showing him as a young man overburdened with armour and weaponry.

Now the 90-year-old is set to return to the beaches of northern France to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

Mr Noody has spent this week in the 
village of Aldbourne in Wiltshire, where he was stationed with Fox 
Company, part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne 
Division.

That regiment is the one immortalised in TV series Band of Brothers, which depicts the heroics of Easy Company towards the end of the Second World War.

On his return to Britain, Mr Noody visited the Blue Boar pub in Aldbourne, which served as the officers' mess in the days before D-Day.

He also met fellow veteran Cecil Newton, from the 47 Royal Dragoon Guards, in the town's memorial hall, which includes a display honouring the American troops stationed in Aldbourne.

This weekend, he will leave Britain and travel on to Normandy for the 70th anniversary commemorations.

Mr Noody's trip to Europe was partly funded by an online campaign which raised $2,645 (£1,600) for his travel costs and expenses.

Rob Stark, who organised the campaign and accompanied Mr Noody, wrote online: 'Bob Noody is an Airborne vet of WWII. He landed in Normandy on D-Day to help liberate the French and the world of Hitler's tyranny.

'Bob wants to go back to Normandy for the last time in 2014 which is the 70th anniversary of his drop into Normandy.'

Mr Noody originally wanted to be a priest before he was drafted into the Army in 1943, at the age of just 18.

He became a paratrooper because it offered him extra pay, and joined Fox Company just in time for 'Operation Overlord', the mission to recapture France for the Allies.

After training in Aldbourne, Mr Noody and his comrades took off from Upottery Airfield on June 5, 1944 - when he was photographed in an image which would become iconic of the strength and bravery of American troops serving in Europe.

The brave soldier, who also fought at the Battle of the Bulge, was eventually awarded two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star, two Presidential Unit Citations and the Croix de Guerre.

However, his wife Elizabeth knew nothing of his heroics until she came across the famous photo in a magazine years after the war.

Bob Noody was a member of 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, one of the most storied regiments of the U.S. Army.

He served in the regiment's Fox Company - but it is Easy Company which is the best known of all, thanks to its heroics recorded in the TV series Band of Brothers.

The company was involved in many of the key operations which took place towards the end of the Second World War.

Its members took part in the airborne landings in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944, which would long be remembered as D-Day.

They also fought in Operation Market Garden, a failed attempt to break through the German lines in September 1944, and in the Siege of Bastogne, part of the Battle of the Bulge.

Finally, they helped to capture the 'Eagle's Nest', Hitler's mountain retreat, in the final weeks of the war, one of the totemic victories which helped hasten the German surrender.

Easy Company's exploits were dramatised in 2001 by Band of Brothers, a 10-part series produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.
