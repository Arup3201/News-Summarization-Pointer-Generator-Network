Elizabeth Edwards tormented herself by using video footage of Rielle Hunter and John as her computer screensaver so she could watch her husband's reaction to his lover again and again, according to Hunter's new book.

Despite the pain the affair caused John Edwards' cancer-stricken wife, Hunter says she has no regrets 'following her heart' into the bed of a man who was married for 32 years.

Just days before the release of the mistress' tell-all memoir, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' new pictures show Hunter on a North Carolina beach getaway with the disgraced politician and their daughter.

Tell-all: Hunter was pictured with her daughter Quinn on a beach in North Carolina days before her book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' is set for release

Hunter offers lurid details about the couple's sex life, especially the 'extraordinary,' sleepless night that she 'surrendered' to Edwards -- just hours after meeting him at a reception in a New York City hotel. 

She claims she wrote the lurid book for Quinn, the couple's four-year-old love child. Edwards denied she was his daughter for nearly two years.

Hunter bragged that she played a role in destroying the 'myth' of John and Elizabeth Edwards, but says the book is part of her 'duty' to Edwards' three other children.

People magazine has released an excerpt of the memoir, which is due out on Tuesday, that describes Elizabeth's tortured reaction to learning that her husband was having an affair with his campaign videographer.

'Elizabeth requested all the tapes (I’d made of the campaign). She locked herself in a room to watch,' Hunter writes.

'On one tape she saw Johnny walking into a room and his reaction to seeing me. She apparently told him that he never once looked at her the way he looked at me. So she took that bit and put it on her computer as a screen saver in order to watch it over and over again.

However, she praised her lover for 'standing up' to his wife when they argued about his affair.

Elizabeth demanded to know how her husband could be attracted to someone like Hunter -- who has a history of cocaine use and was the inspiration for a sexually voracious, drug-addled New York party girl character in the 1988 novel 'Story of My Life.'

Edwards reportedly responded: 'She makes me happy.'

'He was so strong, fearless, and hoest in every other area of his life, but when it came to her, he was incredibly weak,' Hunter writes.

Elizabeth was battling breast cancer as news of her husband's affair and their love child hit the public. She succumbed to the horrific disease in December 2010.

But Hunter shows only scorn for Elizabeth. She says she was controlling and abusive toward her husband, which drove him into the arms of other women.

Hunter calls her lover's late wife 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.'

'Many people invested their hearts, their time and their energy into the image of John and Elizabeth Edwards. While this image wasn't exactly true, I did play a role in destroying this myth, and many supporters ended up feeling hurt, betrayed, and disillusioned,' she writes, according to Radar Online. 

She goes on to say the book is meant to tell 'the truth' about the affair to the public, but also to the three children, Cate, Emma Claire and Jack, that Edwards had with his wife.

'I feel that I owe them the full story. I also believe that I have a responsibility to Johnny and his entire family to offer the truth,' she says.

Hunter describes Edwards as cowed by his wife, an older woman who was an accomplished lawyer.

Elizabeth Edwards and Hunter actually met at a campaign event in December 2006, while Hunter was working for Edwards campaign, before she learned of the affair.

'I introduced myself. Elizabeth did not look me in the eye. In fact, she appeared to be frightened,' Hunter writes.

Hunter also met Edwards' two young children, at his insistence, just a month and a half after they started sleeping together.

He brought Emma Claire and Jack, age six and eight at the time, to a mall -- without his wife -- where he introduced them to his new mistress.

Hunter claims she quickly won both children over after they went to a Cold Stone Creamery for ice cream.

Elizabeth finally kicked Edwards' out of the house and formally separated from him in December 2009 when Edwards was about to undergo dental surgery.

The final straw for the publicly-humiliated wife was her husband's demand to see Quinn, his love child, before doctors sedated him.

'Johnny had had enough and took the first step toward taking control of his own life,' she writes.
