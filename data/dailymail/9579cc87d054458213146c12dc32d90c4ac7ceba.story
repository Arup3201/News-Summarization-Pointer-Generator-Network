Chris Froome fractured his left wrist and right hand as his Tour de France title defence ended on Wednesday, the Team Sky rider has revealed.

Froome's Tour ended not in Paris on July 27, but with a premature departure home, battered and bruised following an eventful two days in northern France.

After the second of two crashes on stage five from Ypres to Arenberg Porte du Hinaut - and three crashes in two days - Froome withdrew to his support car, with Richie Porte inheriting the leadership of Team Sky.

Called it a day: Froome abandoned the Tour during the fifth stage between Ypres to Arenburg Porte du Hinaut

Froome, who returned home to Monaco on
 Wednesday evening, wrote on Twitter: 'MRIs done, confirmed fractures to
 the left wrist & right hand. Time for some R&R...'

Froome,
 a convincing winner of the 2013 Tour, crashed on stage four and had 
immediate scans which could not confirm any fractures.

Further tests at the Monaco Institute of Sport showed the breaks.

Team Sky's lead doctor Alan Farrell told teamsky.com: 'Chris suffered a small fracture to one of the bones in his left wrist.

Pain: Froome looks hurt as he gets into the Team Sky car after abandoning the race

VIDEO Froome 'bitterly disappointed' with Tour withdrawal  

'The
 investigations also revealed a small fracture to a bone in Chris's 
right hand, which hadn't caused him any undue pain over the two stages.

'The fact Chris hadn't felt discomfort in his right hand shows how tough he is, and the pain threshold he has.

'Chris
 has been incredibly brave throughout this whole process and clearly did
 not take the decision to withdraw from the Tour de France lightly.

'Thankfully,
 his injuries won't be keeping him off the bike for too long and we 
expect him to return to training in the next few weeks.'

Froome could now alter his season's focus to the Vuelta a Espana, which begins in Jerez on August 23.

Froome's team-mate Xabier Zandio abandoned the Tour following a crash on Thursday's sixth stage.

Farrell added: 'Xabi withdrew on Thursday after suffering a head injury during the race.

'An
 initial road-side assessment revealed that more urgent investigations 
were required, so we transferred him to a local hospital where he 
underwent a CT brain scan and a series of X-rays.

'I'm pleased to report that they came back clear and Xabi is now recovering at home in Spain.

'He
 has extensive superficial injuries from his crashes on stages five and 
six, but he too is set to make a relatively quick recovery.'
