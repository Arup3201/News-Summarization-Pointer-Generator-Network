The world's first motorised lawnmower has been restored to its former glory more than a century after being invented as the ultimate rich man's toy - costing the equivalent of £15,000 today. 

Andrew Hall, 54, a gardener from Ilminster, Somerset, spent four years working on the 1.25 ton machine that was the forerunner of suburban lawns across the world today.

The Ransome driveable mower cost £137 in 1902 - equivalent to £15,000 today - and was a 20th Century alternative to horse-driven and steam-powered mowers.

The machine at work in Bournville: The 8ft long mower was initially purchased by Cadbury's

Because only the rich could afford them at first they were driven by chauffeurs who were given the task of tending to their master’s lawns.

The 8ft long machine, that is about the same size as a Mini, was initially purchased by Cadbury’s and used in the Bournville village in Warwickshire to maintain a sports field.

It was then bought second-hand by Peugeot Talbot in 1923 to mow their sports field in Coventry.

However, when the motoring firm extended their pavilion they built a new structure over the top of the machine, totally encasing it.

It lay forgotten for more than 50 years until the building was demolished.

Mr Hall had to build a new side frame and a grass box assembly to restore the machine

Luckily, the main frame, body, rollers, cutting cylindar blades and 1906 3hp engine were still intac

Mower enthusiast Mr Hall was then given the machine which he has painstakingly restored. 

Luckily, the main frame, body, rollers, cutting cylindar blades and 1906 3hp engine were still intact. 

Mr Hall had to build a new side frame and a grass box assembly and had to locate and replace the chains which run down one side.

Mr Hall, 54, a gardener, said: 'As collectors you are always having to look for rare items or what people haven’t heard of.

Mr Hall said the machine runs a bit slower than a modern lawn mower and it is loud like tractor

'When I first saw the mower it looked a bit forlorn, someone had gone at it with a sledge hammer and there was nothing in front of the cutting cylinder.

'After I was given it I realised it was the first one that Ransom’s made when I spotted the identification number.

'It has taken four years to restore it and I would say it was 60 per cent intact, and I had to build some new parts.

'It was a mammoth job and a real labour of love.

The 1902 Ransome is a historic survivor from the Edwardian age when chauffeurs were given the task of grooming their masters lawns

It took Mr Hall four years to rebuild and source the parts of the world's first motorised lawnmower

The mower now forms part of Mr Hall's mammoth collection of 1,200 machines

'It took so long because of the rebuilding and sourcing of parts and putting it all together.

'One of the things I had to do was find a magneto and carberetta.

'I used a stop valve from a central heating system in a block of flats in London as a wheel for adjusting the height of the cutting cylinder.

'It runs a bit slower than a modern lawn mower, I would say it is about walking pace.

'When the engine is running everybody knows about it because it is very loud like a traction engine.

'There aren’t any brakes on it because it was just designed for use on flat ground.

'There’s a wheel and what you do is turn it one way or the other and somewhere in the middle there is a neutral position.

'But there aren’t any gears and to stop you have to turn it off.'

The mower now forms part of Mr Hall's mammoth collection of 1,200 machines housed in a large shed at his home.
