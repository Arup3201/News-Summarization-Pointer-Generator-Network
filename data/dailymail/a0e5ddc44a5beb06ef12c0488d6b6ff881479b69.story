Cyndi Lauper's classic disco hit Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun is increasingly becoming out-dated after it was revealed that it is actually men who have more fun.

According to the latest study, a third of women admit being ‘a bit boring’ after getting stuck in a rut in their work and social lives while they are convinced men are having a better time.

Balancing full-time employment with raising a family leaves women with less time to relax or let their hair down on nights out with friends.

A third of women admit being 'a bit boring' while they are convinced men are having a better time - a view shared by many British men

Many women believe men have more fun than they do, with three quarters saying it is because partners have 'less responsibility in the home' and over half believing it's down to men caring less about what others think of them.

And 39 per cent say men are more joyful, simply because they have busier social lives.

But it seems personality also has a role to play, with some women admitting they are just too shy to get the party started.

Only one in seven women claim to take the lead as an 'extrovert' or 'instigator of fun'.

Furthermore, just five per cent of women say they make themselves laugh most, while a third say their husband or boyfriend is most likely to make them giggle.

As a result, a mere 17 per cent believe of women they are more fun than their male counterparts and 35 per cent admit being boring.

This is in stark contrast to men with a quarter of British males viewing themselves as fun-loving extroverts and eleven per cent even insist they make themselves laugh more than anyone else.

Because of busy work schedules and the pressures of raising a family, women are finding it harder to enjoy their social life

Consultant psychologist Anjula Mutanda
said: 'Women feel they are still shouldering more of the household 
responsibilities, giving them less time to step back and have fun.

'Couples need to stop psychologically dividing household tasks into men’s and women’s work and adopt a more 50/50 approach.

'Women also tend to laugh more when a man tells a joke than vice versa.

'This affects how a woman may behave and her confidence about being seen to be the instigator of fun and humour.'

The
research, by bingo website Jackpotjoy, also found that men dominate 
lists of people we think are most fun and who make us laugh.

Funny man Alan Carr and Mayor Boris Johnson were voted as the ideal best friends because they look fun, according to the survey

Chatty man TV host Alan Carr is the celebrity Brits most want as a best friend because he is the 'most fun'.

Mop-haired mayor of London Boris Johnson came second in the poll, with 16.5 per cent, and flirty comic Russell Brand third, with 10 per cent.

Barbara Windsor has launched the new £250k Jackpotjoy.com FUNdation on Facebook that grants FUNds for daft ideas.

Barbara said: 'I want to see British women embracing a bit more fun in their lives and giving the boys a run for their money.'
