Argentina has launched another salvo in its war of words over the Falkland Islands by threatening businesses who join the search for oil in the South Atlantic.

The country’s foreign minister Hector Timerman said it would pursue legal action against firms exploring around the islands - and any other companies who do business with them.

The British Government hit back, accusing Argentina’ of ‘illegal intimidation’.

And Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Britain would continue to ‘stick up’ for Falklanders’ rights.

Mr Timerman said there would be ‘administrative, civil and criminal’ penalties against any companies involved.

‘We will not let a single day go by 
without filing some action in a court, administrative seat or 
international tribunal enabling us to protect the reserves which belong 
to the people and to the Argentine Republic,’ he said.

‘The gas and oil that is found in the South Atlantic belongs to the Argentinian people.

‘All these companies are entering illegal territory.’

He has assembled a team of lawyers and officials to chase companies through the courts wherever they do business.

As well as oil explorers, it will target firms which supply them, as well as banks and financial companies.

Buenos Aires has ramped up its rhetoric over the Islands in the run up to April 2, the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.

It has already closed Argentine 
shipping lanes to companies searching for oil. Experts think billions of
pounds worth of oil may be buried under the sea bed around the 
Falklands.

Mr Timmerman said companies involved 
in oil exploration in Falklands waters were ‘violating UN resolutions’ 
calling for talks on sovereignty.

The Foreign Office said the search for oil was a legitimate commercial venture.

A spokesman said: ‘These latest 
attempts to damage the economic livelihoods of the Falkland Islands 
people regrettably reflect a pattern of behaviour by the Argentine 
government.

‘We are studying Argentina’s remarks 
carefully and will work closely with any company potentially affected to
ensure that the practical implications for them are as few as possible.

‘From harassing Falklands shipping to
threatening the islanders’ air links with Chile, Argentina’s efforts to
intimidate the Falklands are illegal, unbecoming and wholly 
counter-productive.'

On 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the Falklands, only to be defeated by a British task force sent to recover them.

The UK says there will be no negotiations on sovereignty as long as the Falkland islanders wish to remain British.

Speaking in the U.S. following talks 
with President Obama, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘The people of 
the Falkland Islands could not be clearer that they want to continue 
their status as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom.

‘As long as they want that, that is not going to change.

‘To me it is very important that we 
stick up for the right of self-determination. The people who live in the
Falkland Islands want to continue with their current status.

‘What I wanted to do in this 30th 
anniversary year is send a very clear signal to the rest of the world - 
Argentina and others - that while the Falkland Islanders want that 
status Britain will help them keep that status.’
