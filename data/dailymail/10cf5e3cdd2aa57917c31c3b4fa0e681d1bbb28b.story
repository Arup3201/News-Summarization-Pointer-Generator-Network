Tottenham will this week consider an £5million swoop for Burnley striker Danny Ings.

Mauricio Pochettino wants to add to his forward line before the transfer deadline, and Ings is high on his list of options.

Ings has been on Tottenham's radar for over 12 months, with former boss Tim Sherwood interested in the forward during his time in the hotseat.

Danny Ings has scored seven goals for Burnley this season but he may still ending up leaving the club

Spurs have retained their interest and are set to move for the 22-year-old, who has scored seven goals for the Clarets this season.

The White Hart Lane club had been interested in Saido Berahino, but are not prepared to meet West Bromwich's £20million asking price.

Pochettino's interest in Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez has cooled owing to the England international's long-running battle to recover from a serious knee injury.

A move for Ings may depend on moving players out of the club in the coming days.

Pochettino wants to shift a number of players this month as he looks to free up money on his wage bill.

Mauricio Pochettino is one of the managers keen on getting Ings' signature, and wants him at Tottenham

They were successful in offloading Kyle Naughton in Swansea last week, recouping £5million.

And they remain hopeful in trying to sell more players this month, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon, Vlad Chiriches, Younes Kaboul and Paulinho all available.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche will want to keep his prized-asset until at least the end of the season.

But with the striker's contract due to expire in the summer, the club will find it hugely difficult to resist an substantial offer for Ings this month.

Because Ings is under 23, Burnley would receive a compensation fee, understood to be in the region of £3million, for the forward should he run down his contract.

So any bid upward of that figure is likely to be considered by Burnley.
