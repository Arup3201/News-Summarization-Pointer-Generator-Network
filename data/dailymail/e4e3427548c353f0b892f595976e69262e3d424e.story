'Technically it was around 120 something days but 100 days sounds better,' Bray wrote on the video's webpage. 'I had a GoPro camera set up on my cabinet and i just recorded myself doing the same dance routine every day.'

The video shows Bray dancing to 'Canned Heat' by Jamiroquai and using dance moves Jon Heder used as character Napoleon Dynamite in the 2004 film of the same name.

Throughout the video, Bray wears multiple different outfits and even seems to dress up as a Blues Brother and Pokemon character Ash Ketchum.

At the end of the video, the song's volume lowers and an 'embarrassed' Bray - now with visibly longer hair -Â  is seen looking at the camera and running away.

Bray wrote that he decided to create the video as part of his bucket list.

'I wanted to do something along the lines of take a picture of myself everyday for a year but different,' he said. 'I eventually came up with the idea of 100 days of dance, I really didn't want to do this for a year so i thought 100 days seemed pretty good.'
