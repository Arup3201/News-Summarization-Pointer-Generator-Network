FIFA investigator Michael Garcia will take into account the evidence revealed in the Sunday Times investigation before submitting his report on allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. 

In fact, senior FIFA sources said on Monday night that Garcia was already in possession of the documents central to the expose before the story was printed at the weekend. ‘It would be naive to think otherwise,’ said the source. 

The investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee - chaired by Garcia - responded to the reports yesterday by issuing a statement.

Investigator: Michael Garcia will submit a report on allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups

It said: ‘After months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials, we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by June 9, 2014, and to submit a report to the Adjudicatory Chamber approximately six weeks thereafter. The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process, including evidence collected from prior investigations.’ 

Officials at the ethics committee office refused to elaborate but the timing is clearly designed to defuse the issue for FIFA’s annual congress in Sao Paulo next week and the duration of the World Cup. 

On Monday there were further calls for a re-vote for the hosts of the 2022 tournament, amid claims that disgraced Qatari former FIFA vice-president Mohamed Bin Hammam had made secret payments amounting to £3million to secure votes for his country. The claims have been vehemently denied by the bid team in Qatar.

But Lord Goldsmith, a member of FIFA’s independent governance committee, said the world governing body needed ‘to produce a convincing and transparent answer to these allegations’.

‘I believe that if these allegations are shown to be true, then the hosting decision for Qatar has to be rerun,’ he told the BBC.
