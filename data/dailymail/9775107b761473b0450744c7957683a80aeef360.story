Recovering: Springer spaniel Lilly, pictured with owner Zoe Flynn, is back at home recuperating after plummeting 80ft down a cliff

A brave springer spaniel is recovering at home after miraculously survivng a 80ft plunge off the edge of a rocky cliff.

Lilly bolted off while on a walk with owner Viv Salisbury, crawling under a gap in some railings before plummeting down a steep rock face on the Kent coast at Broadstairs.

Still holding on to the leads of her other three spaniels - Ozzie, four, Toby, two, and Milo, one - Ms Salisbury, 49, screamed for her husband Harold Acheson, 54.

He ran towards the edge and was confronted with Lilly's lifeless body lying 80ft below.

Making his way down the cliff, he feared the worse finding the spaniel lying on her side.

But miraculously the stunned pooch survived the accident on April 18 with only a few scratches and bruises.

Viv, a cook who walks her dogs daily along the beach said: 'We keep the others on a lead but we usually let her off.

'I yelled, "Where's Lilly?" when I realised she'd gone.

'I then noticed a gap in the railings and saw she must have gone through it and over the cliff.

'I thought there is no way she could have survived a fall like that.

'But, thankfully, she is very light and landed on sand. It was scary, we're so pleased she's alright.'

Mr Acheson, a business owner, scooped a shocked Lilly up in his arms before putting her in their car and driving her straight to the vets.

After a thorough check-up to see if she had broken any bones or suffered serious internal injuries Lilly was given the all-clear.

Lifeless: Ms Salisbury screamed at her husband Harold Acheson, who ran down the cliff face where he was confronted with Lilly's lifeless body. He scooped her up and rushed her to the vets, where she was found to have suffered only a few scratches and bruising

Bruised and scratched: Mother-of-two Ms Salisbury, added: 'She is quite badly bruised and on morphine. 'But she's well on her way back to full health and it won't be long til she's bounding around again'

The couple took her home to Rochester, Kent, where she was given painkillers and put to bed.

Mother-of-two Ms Salisbury, added: 'She is quite badly bruised and on morphine.

'She gets restless and tries to jump around, but soon realises she can't do what she usually does at the moment.

'But she's well on her way back to full health and it won't be long til she's bounding around again.

'We like going to the coast because the dogs can go on the beach all the year round and they like to swim in the sea.

'Despite the shock of what has happened it would not put us off going there again.

'Being springer spaniels they are lively dogs but we shall be keeping a close eye on Lilly next time.'
