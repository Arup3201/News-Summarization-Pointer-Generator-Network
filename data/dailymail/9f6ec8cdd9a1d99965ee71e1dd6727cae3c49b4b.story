Harry Hill is proving that he has a serious side by fronting a UK campaign which will grant £150,000 to UK charities supporting children with life-limiting conditions.

The comedian is working with the Newman's Own Foundation, set up by the late Hollywood actor Paul Newman. 

He says: 'I am thrilled to be involved with 
Newman's Own Foundation this year. When I heard about the great work the
 charity does in the UK I wanted to get involved and help spread the 
word about the grants that UK charities can apply for.'

Earlier this year Harry Hill visited Roundabout, a drama therapy charity that has received £9,000 from Newman's Own Foundation

The comedian continued: 'Aside from Paul Newman personally being a huge inspiration to me, Newman's Own Foundation has inspired many others and helped countless charities through their continued charitable work.'

Harry has personally experienced the good that the Newman's Own Foundation can do when earlier this year he visited Roundabout, a registered charity which provides drama therapy workshops to children in need across London, which was awarded a £9,000 from Newman’s Own Foundation.

The Newman's Own Foundation is planning to grant UK charities £150,000

Harry Hill has always admired the foundation and is thrilled to campaign on their behalf

Newman's Own Foundation has already donated over US$400 million (approximately
 £236 million) around the world, including nearly US$1.7 million 
(around £1 million) to various UK charities with this latest 
initiative.

Robert Forrester, president of Newman's Own Foundation, says children with life-limiting conditions were a cause particularly close to Paul Newman's heart.

'Supporting children with life-limiting conditions is a key focus area for Newman's Own Foundation because it is one of the areas that Paul Newman cherished, and one with opportunities for the Foundation to make a significant impact,' Forrester explains.

'We encourage charities that support or execute these programs to submit a request for funding.'

To be considered for grants, organisations must be registered UK 
charities providing support for children with life-limiting medical or 
developmental conditions.

Charities meeting the requirements are 
encouraged to submit their requests before the application process 
closes on 16 June, 2014. Final grants will be announced on World Charity
 Day 5 September, 2014.

Selected organisations will be contacted to receive a full application for funding from Newman's Own Foundation.  Additional charity requirements may be found at newmansownfoundation.org/what-we-support/funding-guidelines/. Grantees will be announced on World Charity Day, 5 September, 2014.
