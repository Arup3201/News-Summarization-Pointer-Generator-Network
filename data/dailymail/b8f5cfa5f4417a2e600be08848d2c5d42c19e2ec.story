The TV licence fee could be slashed by £50 under Tory plans which would stop short of scrapping the levy altogether.

The idea is reportedly being pushed by senior Conservatives who want the £145.50 annual charge to be overhauled.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has made clear the cost is 'a lot of money for some people' with some in the government calling for it to be done away with.

The future of the TV licence is in doubt ahead of the BBC charter renewal due in 2016

The BBC's royal charter, which agrees the way the corporation is run and funded, is up for renewal at the end of 2016.

One unnamed minister told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There is a policy proposal going around to cut the licence fee by £50.

'The negotiation after the election will be very big. Some Cabinet ministers regard £50 as the minimum cut.'

However a BBC source said: 'The BBC already has 25 per cent less to spend over this licence fee period and a reduction of a further £50 is equivalent to the loss of BBC One, Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4.' 

The radical £50 plan is not thought to have the backing of Mr Javid who has so far refused to state what level he thinks the licence fee should be after the charter renewal.

Last month he told the Mail: '£145.50 is a lot of money for some people.

'It's incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people's money, and the BBC is no exception to this.'

A source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport today stressed that money would remain tight at the corporation. 'We have to ask the BBC to do more for less,' the source added.

Ministers are already examining whether not paying the licence fee should still be a criminal offence.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid was made clear the £145.50 fee is a lot of money for some people, but has not put a figure on the size of a cut he would like to see

Some 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a TV licence.

They face fines of up to £1,000 and a criminal record - more than 50 a year go to prison. One possibility is to use new technology to cut off BBC channels for those who have not paid

John Whittingdale, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told a party conference meeting this week that it was 'getting steadily harder to sustain the licence fee'.

Rona Fairhead, the new chairman of the BBC Trust, started work in her new role last week with a warning to staff that of the 'need to operate efficiently'.

Rona Fairhead has taken over from former cabinet minister Lord Patten who stood down in May.

In an email to BBC staff, she said she had spent time with director-general Tony Hall and other senior executives in recent weeks.

She said: 'They are under no illusions about the challenging environment; the changing viewing patterns, the explosion of choice and the rapid changes in technologies and markets. 

'They understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past, while building this compelling future.'

The BBC was heavily criticised over excessive payouts given to senior staff including £470,000 to former director-general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson.

Deputy director general Mark Byford departed the BBC with a total payout of £949,000.

The former chief executive of the Financial Times group also said she would 'defend vigorously the BBC's independence while holding it accountable to its audience'.
