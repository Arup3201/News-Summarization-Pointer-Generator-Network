Danny Ings would only leave Burnley in January for a stupid fee, admits boss Sean Dyche.

The in-form centre forward heads to St James' Park to face Newcastle United on New Year's Day where he is very much admired in the corridors of power even though manager Alan Pardew is departing.

But Burnley will only even consider thinking of letting the 22-year-old - who is out of contract in the summer - go if they get silly money.

Danny Ings has impressed during his first season in the Premier League

And their summer spending - only about Â£8 million - means there is no need to cash in.

Manager Sean Dyche said: 'Put it this way, Angel di Maria moved for Â£65m. Ronaldo moved for whatever and also there's Gareth Bale.

'My point is you can never say never but, generally speaking, there's no figure that's been set.

Ings has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs in recent weeks

'Financially, we don't have any worries there because we only bought a couple of bags of chips in the summer and that was it.

'There's plenty of money in the coffers and there's nothing come into me, no contact over him.

'It's only speculation but we've been having that for as long as I remember. I'm used to it.'

The 22-year-old's contract expires at the end of this season but Sean Dyche insists he will not leave in January
