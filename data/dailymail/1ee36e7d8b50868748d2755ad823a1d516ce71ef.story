Nancy Pelosi got political heads in a spin when she proclaimed Newt Gingrich will never become U.S. President because of 'something I know'.

But now her office has backtracked by claiming the former House Speaker, whose position was also once held by Mr Gingrich, has no dirt on him.

Democrat Ms Pelosi definitively told CNN last night that the Republican presidential candidate is ‘not going to be President of the United States’.

'Let me just make my prediction and 
stand by it, it isn't going to happen,’ she told CNN’s John King. ‘There
 is something I know.

'The Republicans, if they choose to nominate him, that's their prerogative. I don't even think that's going to happen.'

But her spokesman Drew Hammill said 
today in a bizarre statement that the ‘something’ she knows is simply 
that he will not become President.

‘Leader Pelosi previously made a 
reference to the extensive amount of information that is in the public 
record,’ Mr Hammill said.

Dish the dirt, Nancy! Pelosi claims to know 'something' about fellow former House speaker Newt Gingrich, seen here with his wife Callista in St Petersburg, Florida, this week

She said last month that there was 
information in her office that could come out and damage Mr Gingrich, 
related to a House ethics investigation.

However several possibilities of her 
latest ‘something’ are being touted by commentators. Some believe it 
could relate to his seedy private life.

His second ex-wife Marianne has 
revealed how he cheated on her with young Washington worker 
Callista Bisek, who became his third wife.

It happened in the late nineties as he
 demanded President Bill Clinton be removed from office for lying on 
oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.

Others think the 'something' Ms Pelosi
 knows comes from her time probing the GOP candidate as she served
 on a Washington committee.

'If she knows something, I have a simple challenge. Spit it out'

She suggested she would reveal 
'thousands' of pages of an ethics committee investigation into the GOP 
frontrunner 'when the time's right.'

'I served on the investigative 
committee that investigated him, four of us locked in a room in an 
undisclosed location for a year,’ she said.

Mr Gingrich has rebutted, by telling NBC on Wednesday: 'If she knows something, I have a simple challenge. Spit it out'.
