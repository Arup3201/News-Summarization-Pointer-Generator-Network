PICTURE OF THE DAY

Good job Germany boss Joachim Low took his sunglasses for a summer holiday in Brazil. He nailed the Sir Cliff Richard look but it’ll be congratulations all round if his side beat Brazil.

Fashion: Joachim Low rocking some aviators that are very similar to a pair owned by Cliff Richard

Voodoo priest hopes to turn tables on Germany

A Brazilian voodoo priest will attempt to inflict some black magic on Germany ahead of Tuesday’s game by cursing a doll of their most important player on his altar.

It’s just a shame he couldn’t use his powers to protect Neymar…

Brazil squad breed fighting spirit

If Brazil fly out the traps against Germany it might have something to do with how they spend their leisure time.

Stars including David Luiz and Julio Cesar cheered on countryman Lyoto Machida during an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout in Las Vegas.

Now you see me, now you don't

The vanishing spray used by referees at the World Cup may soon appear in the Premier League.

The foam made from vegetable oil derivatives — which will be used in the Champions League next season — is expected to be discussed by Premier League clubs after referees’ chief Mike Riley filed a report on its application in the World Cup.

Bundesliga leading the way

Germany’s Bundesliga is the best represented league in the World Cup semi-finals with almost a quarter of players hailing from there. The Premier League (20) is a close second.

Italy's Serie A trails behind with 14 representatives while Holland's win over Costa Rica has helped boost the Eredivisie numbers to 10.

Hosts feel the heat at last-four stage

Brazil should beware the curse of the semi-finals. In three of the last six World Cups the host nation has exited at the last-four stage (Italy 1990, South Korea 2002 and Germany 2006).

Relaxed: Stand-in captain David Luiz will lead Brazil out against Germany with Thiago Silva suspended

Best of the bets

Our top tipsters Brian Lee and Chris Cutmore go head to head with today’s best bets.

Best-bet Brian

9/2 - Germany as party-poopers, a role they have thrived in since before Franz Beckenbauer was a boy. Get on Thomas Muller to score in a win for the Germans.

Cut-price Chris

11/1 - A World Cup semi- final with Germany can only end in a predictable victory on penalties, right? Maybe not this time. Brazil to win a shootout is a nice 11/1.

In-form: You can get odds of 9/1 for Thomas Muller to score in a Germany win against Brazil on Tuesday
