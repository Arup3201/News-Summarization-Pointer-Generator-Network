It's every dieter’s dream: the cheese that could actually help you shave off those extra pounds.

Sales of quark – a soft cheese that’s virtually fat free – have rocketed by 37.9 per cent in the last year. 

Health-conscious Britons forked out a staggering £8.5million for the ingredient, a jump of £2.3million from the previous year.

Sales of soft cheese quark, which is virtually fat free, has shot through the roof to 37.9 per cent in the last year

Hailed as the new ‘superfood’, quark is low in salt and sugar but high in protein – which makes you feel fuller. 

It tastes rich and creamy, but contains less than a fifth of the calories found in cream cheese.

Nutritionist Fiona Hunter, from Notting Hill in London, said: ‘People are taking more responsibility for their own health now and are making healthy decisions.

The majority of the quark market’s growth in the UK – 94 per cent – is down to Lake District Dairy Co.

'Quark is being used in more and more recipes and I advise people to use it.’ 

She added: ‘Quark is lower in fat than any other soft cheese on the market – it is even lower than reduced fat products. 

'We have a huge problem with obesity in this country, but using something like this means we can still enjoy our favourite foods.’

The product has a host of celebrity fans, including 45-year-old singer Jennifer Lopez, Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen, 34, and the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother Carole Middleton, 59. 

The majority of the quark market’s growth in the UK – 94 per cent – is down to Lake District Dairy Co.

The British firm, set up in 2008 and based in Wigton, Cumbria, offers three flavours – original, vanilla and lemon – all of which are fat-free and use only natural ingredients.

The company’s spokesman David Young said: ‘We knew there was a real gap in the market but the incredible sales growth we’ve seen for quark in the last year have gone beyond even our expectations.’
