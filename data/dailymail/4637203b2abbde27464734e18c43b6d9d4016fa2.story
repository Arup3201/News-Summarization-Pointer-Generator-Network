Thierry Henry has admitted that he would love to return to Arsenal one day - and win the Champions League with them.

The Frenchman does not envisage returning to the Gunners as a player for the third time, but he would be interesting in heading back to North London in a coaching capacity or another role.

Henry, 37, is still playing for the New York Red Bulls in the MLS and netted 10 times last season but is already contemplating his future.

Speaking to L'Equipe, the 1998 World Cup winner said: 'Nothing is clear (concerning my future).

'I have not taken any decision and speculation is not my thing. One thing is certain: I will stay in football, as a coach, a consultant or executive. We will see.

'The second certainty is that I would love to see Arsenal win the Champions League.'

And Henry, who scored 226 goals for the Gunners between 1999 and 2007 before returning to net twice in seven appearances in 2012, admits he would love to be a part of any potential European success at the Emirates.

He continued: 'Whether that is from near or far does not depend on me but it is sure I'd like to help.

'This is my club and, as a player, I was not able to give them the Champions League.'

During Henry's time with Arsenal, the Gunners reached the Champions League final in 2006 only to eventually lose 2-1 to Barcelona but the 51-cap Frenchman hopes to see the club win it one day.
