It looks likely that Nathan Cleverly will return to Tony Bellew’s backyard for their rematch - and the winner is virtually guaranteed a world title shot.

I’m pushing for an announcement next week; the fight was originally scheduled for December 6 but with Kell Brook’s injury, November 29 has been mooted. It looks like it will be in Liverpool and we’re tying up the loose ends now but I’m confident it will happen.

Originally, we were going to be in Sheffield which was a neutral venue but now Nathan’s going to be travelling to Liverpool again. Obviously he would prefer it in Cardiff or at a neutral venue but in order to achieve financial targets Liverpool makes most sense.

You have to take your hat off to Nathan who doesn’t seem fazed by returning to Tony’s city. If a fighter is not fighting at home, he needs to be compensated. Although this is only two or three hours from Nathan’s home, it isn’t Cardiff and we have a unique situation where I promote both fighters. I have a duty to ensure both fighters get the best deal going into this fight which is an interesting scenario. I’m having to deal with both of them so the common sense argument is applied which is that if you’re at home you should take less than you’d get if you’re fighting away. That dynamic applies to all fighters, particularly at world level.

We have already agreed with Kalle Sauerland that the winner will face Marco Huck for the WBO world title and they’re also happy for the winner, and maybe even the loser, to fight Pablo Hernandez for the IBF title. Whilst the fight will carry eliminator status, it’s actually more powerful than that because terms have virtually been agreed with the champion for the winner.

Both men want the fight badly; Tony in particular. He lost the first fight so he wants to settle the score. Nathan doesn’t like Tony and wants to knock him out. It’s great to be involved in a fight where there is so much on the line.

The one trend in my conversations with them is that they want to knock each other out, they don’t want to win on points. Nathan said he’s already beaten him on points now he wants to take him out inside the distance and Tony wants to flatten him, quite honestly. He’s a fighter who would be disappointed with a points decision.

I think we’ll have a different type of fight to the first one, which was a great fight but at times it was strategic and technical. This one will be about emotion, ego and will to win.

I’m very fond of both fighters. This is the first time I’ve made a fight at this level where ive promoted both fighters. It is difficult but I’ve told them both that it’s a great fight and may the best man win. Whatever happens, there’s a future for both of them in the division but obviously the winner will go on and do big things.

It was another spectacular performance from Scott Quigg last weekend and quite frankly the time is now for the Carl Frampton fight. People have always said it would be great if one of them could pick up a world title, or both could have world titles, well now there’s no excuse. They are both world champions and it’s really the only fight that people want to see either of them in.

Quigg retained his WBA World Super Bantamweight title in the win and Carl Frampton must be next

We are co-promoting Frampton’s mandatory Chris Avalos but we’ve seen from correspondence to the IBF and Top Rank that Carl is injured and will not be able to fulfill his obligation within the stated period. It is likely now the IBF will grant a medical exemption and give him a further 60 days to make the fight. My decision to get involved with Avalos was two fold. One, I feel I can maximize his earning potential through the opportunities and my experience within this market and two it gives me an opportunity to make the Quigg vs Frampton fight next while compensating Avalos accordingly.

Frampton has to fight Avalos by December 4 but now that he’s injured, he’ll have to fight him by the end of February. His injury puts more pressure on making the Quigg-Frampton fight because he’s now not expecting to fight Avalos until February or March and I don’t think the British public will wait much longer for that fight.

If Frampton is not going to be ready until then, I’ll be looking to get Quigg out again before the end of the year.

I’ve already made contact with the McGuigans and requested a meeting to try and look at the opportunities. As I write this, I’m still waiting for a reply.

But there are no true obstacles in making this fight, only ego.

Only ego is preventing a fight between Quigg and Frampton to take place

If we don’t get the opportunity to provide these two great fighters with the biggest pay day of their career, quite frankly both teams should be ashamed with themselves.

In terms of the location, the fight will happen wherever it makes most commercial sense. Obviously, we wouldn’t be able to go outside in Belfast until June/July through to August or early September.

The biggest indoor arena in Belfast is the Odyssey which holds 9,000 but this fight would quite comfortably fill the Phones4U Arena in Manchester which holds 21,000.

My idea of a two-fight deal is purely based on giving both fighters the fight in their home town and, more importantly, the opportunity for them to make huge money twice.

It doesn’t have to be two fights but when a financial opportunity like this comes up in the super-bantamweight division, you should be clutching it with both hands.

Kell Brook had his staples out this week. Many will have seen in the Sportsmail story the horrific injury that was sustained but Kell is a remarkable healer and is already on his feet. I think we will see him back in the gym by the end of October.

When you see an injury like that you wonder whether you’ll ever see him in a ring again but thankfully he’s going to be ok and he’ll be back firing in no time.

Floyd Mayweather won again at the weekend and, as usual, everyone in the 147lb division will play the waiting game and try to get their shot.

I said around a year ago I didn’t think Floyd would fight Amir Khan in May. He didn’t. I also said he wouldn’t fight Amir in September. He didn’t. I’m now saying he won’t fight Amir next May.

Now, I understand that everyone wants that fight but there also comes a time when you have to stop hanging around and prostituting yourself for a shot when you have an opportunity to give the British public what they want in a huge all-British clash with Kell Brook for the world title.

From our side, we are prepared to go straight into the Khan fight. I spoke to Kell about this and his response was: ‘I’ll beat him with one leg’.

We are already making plans for Kell’s return in February or March. If Amir misses the boat and doesn’t get the Mayweather fight he really is in no man’s land in the division.

I reiterate my respect for Amir as a fighter. He’s achieved so much in the sport at such a young age but I feel we have an opportunity here to make something really special for British boxing. Perhaps he knows that defeat to Kell Brook may signal the end of his career. 

Amir Khan has failed to get his fight against Floyd Mayweather so a clash with Brook should be on the cards

We have a number of lightweights in our team who are all looking for that world title shot.

Mickey Bey’s surprise win over Miguel Vazquez last weekend has triggered a number of calls from our fightes requesting that fight. I’ve put their names in the mix with Al-Haymon’s team.

Richar Abril will defend his WBA world title against Edis Tatli this Saturday. I’m confident that if he comes through, I can deliver the shot for Anthony Crolla later this year.

We saw the rematch between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora announced this week. 

Although the first fight was disappointing, expect the second to be closer. 

You have to feel for Fury, he has had three big fights scheduled and on sale over the last year, and all three have failed to materialise. 

I really hope for his sake, and career, that this one actually happens.

Finally our thoughts and prayers are with Jerome Wilson and his family after he was injured during his fight in Sheffield last Friday. 

I was at the fight and the paramedics and doctors reacted within an instant to help him. 

It’s been amazing to see the boxing community gather to support Jerome. It’s a special sport with special people.
