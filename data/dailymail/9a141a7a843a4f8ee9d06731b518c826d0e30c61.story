The harrowing moment a high-flying financial adviser murdered the mother of his newborn daughter was recorded on the voicemail of a mobile phone, a court heard today.

In the eight-minute recording - during which time it is believed the 28-year-old mother died - Paul Keene can be heard threatening to kill her amidst sounds of choking, banging and screaming.

Keene can then be heard strangling his partner with a dressing gown cord - and when that failed - an electrical cable, at which point she can be heard uttering her last words 'please don't'.

Tragic: Carmen Miron-Buchacra, 28, pictured, was strangled by her partner in a drink-fuelled rage which was recorded on her friend's mobile phone, a court heard today

Financial adviser Paul Keene, pictured with his partner known as Gaby, allegedly strangled her with a dressing gown cord and then an electrical cable

The 32-year-old snapped and strangled
his girlfriend, 'outstanding and gifted' PhD student Carmen Gabriela Miron-Buchacra, in a 
drink-fuelled rage, Bristol Crown Court was told.

Mexican-born Miss Miron-Buchacra,
a student at Bath University’s Department of Biology and Biochemistry, 
begged for her life as Keene throttled her with an electrical flex as 
the couple’s 11-week-old baby lay in a cot nearby.

Her desperate fight
for life as she tried to fend off the attack was 
caught in a telephone call to one of their friends on the night of June 
23 this year, the court heard.

Keene can be heard swearing at his partner and threatening to kill her during the eight-minute call.

The court heard it was recorded on 
the answerphone of Ben Jones and showed how she was repeatedly punched 
in the face and strangled with a dressing gown cord and electrical 
cable.

Terrified Miss Miron-Buchacra - known as Gaby - called her friend when Keene arrived at their home following an all day drinking binge at a game of boules.

But Ben was out of signal and did not answer the call - meaning that Miss Miron-Buchacra’s last moments and the horrific killing was recorded on his answerphone.

Mother-of-one Miss Miron-Buchacra can be heard pleading as Keene repeatedly punched her in the face, telling her to shut up or 'you will be dead'.

The chilling recording ends after eight minutes and 29 seconds - moments after Miss Miron-Buchacra gasped 'please don’t' and falls silent.

Miss Miron-Buchacra’s body was later discovered lying in a semi-foetal position at the couple’s upmarket flat in Bath, Somerset.

Keene, an administrator for a 
financial services firm, was arrested and charged with murder.

He appeared at Bristol Crown Court where he denied the charge but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control.

The court heard the couple, pictured, were engaged to be married and their 11-week-old baby slept nearby as the alleged killing unfolded

The jury were told how in the recording Keene can be heard snarling: 'Why are you crying?

'What the f*** is your problem? What have I done to you today?

'Carry on like this and I’m going to end up in prison because you will be dead.

'I may kill you because you are a f****** twat.'

Michael Fitton, QC, prosecuting, described how Keene first tried to strangle Miss Miron-Buchacra using a dressing gown cord before switching to an electrical cable to ensure her death.

He said: 'She told him to stop and she can be heard screaming and the sounds of choking and struggling can be heard.

'She was begging him to stop and she was pleading with him to get off her. The defendant said, "you f****** b****, I will kill you". Then there are more sounds of choking, banging and screaming.

'Her last words were, "please don’t", then silence.'

He added: 'When he took hold of the dressing gown cord and wrapped it around his her neck he was clearly trying to kill her.

'When he failed in that attempt and reached for the electrical cable he was showing a persistence to kill her that is at odds with his defence.'

Mr Fitton told how Miss Miron-Buchacra and Keene, who were planning to marry in the autumn of 2013, had been together for two years but their relationship had recently soured.

On the day of the Miss Miron-Buchacra’s death, June 23, 2012, the couple had exchanged a number of angry text messages as he spent the day at a boules tournament with colleagues from Advanced Investments.

He had then met friends in the evening for food and drinks.

Meanwhile, Miss Miron-Buchacra was at
home looking after their daughter Eleanor and was becoming increasingly
annoyed at Keene’s decision to go out for the day.

She accused him of not wanting to spend time with her and Eleanor.

Mr Fitton said that by late afternoon
Miss Miron-Buchacra had walked with Eleanor the short distance from 
their flat to where Keene was playing boules.

'Gaby had some time talking with Paul
Keene and from her expression it seems she was angered by the fact he 
had said to her something to the effect of "get used to it",' Mr Fitton 
said.

'She didn’t stay for long and she left with the baby and went to the flat, five to 10 minutes away.'

Mr Fitton said that as the evening 
progressed text messages between Miss Miron-Buchacra and Keene showed an 'increase in her irritation and the intensity of her mood'.

'Clearly she was still very angry with him and she told him not to come home,' he said.

'By 8.45pm she had made it clear she was not going to let him in at home that night.'

After angry text messages had continued for more than 12 hours in total, drunken Keene turned up at the flat, having drunk eight bottles of beer and a bottle of lager and cider.

He went upstairs to the front door of the flat and texted Miss Miron-Buchacra to let him in.

She immediately replied: 'You’re at 
the door? I told you if you went out of this house and our life for a 
whole day, you do it for life.'

Keene replied: 'Open it or I’ll kick it in.'

Frightened Miss Miron-Buchacra called friend Ben for help but was forced to open the door after her friend lost signal during the call, as he was travelling on a train.

She then called him for a second time 
but was diverted to his voice mail, leaving the phone recording, as 
Keene launched his fatal attack.

When he got off the train, Mr Jones 
realised there was a message on his mobile phone that was an argument 
between Keene and his partner.

The call lasted for eight minutes from 10.45pm until 
10.53pm. It is believed Miss Miron-Buchacra died during the duration of the call.

Mr Fitton said: 'He could hear that Gaby was crying 
and was accusing Paul Keene of being drunk and to get out and leave the 
flat.

'Without listening to all of the call, he tried ringing Paul Keene to try and speak to him but got no reply.

'He also tried ringing Gaby but got no reply.'

Then Mr Jones sent text messages to Miss Miron-Buchacra asking if she was okay. At 11.30pm he received a reply, 
in which she said 'It’s okay Ben, I’m okay.'

He asked her to call him but two minutes later Mr Jones received a reply, which said 'Just gone out for a walk to calm down.

Mr Jones also sent a message to Keene saying he had 10 minutes to get Gaby to ring him or he was calling the police.

At 11.18pm Keene replied and said: 'What? I got home and she’d gone crazy.'

He sent a further message saying Miss
Miron-Buchacra had gone out for a walk and added: 'She went mental on 
me mate because I played boule. Gaby told me off, accusing me of putting
work before family. It’s bullshit. I love my family xx.'

Mr Jones called the emergency services and police and paramedics arrived at the scene and discovered Miss Miron-Buchacra’s body on the bedroom floor of their first-floor Georgian flat in Bath shortly after midnight.

Keene was arrested and admitted killing his fiancee during interview but said he could remember only vague details.

He denies murder and his trial continues.
