Her rapid rise to become the youngest minister in  government has taken some colleagues by surprise.

Now extraordinary claims are circulating at Westminster that Chloe Smith was appointed because David Cameron was confused about her credentials.

Miss Smith, who became the youngest MP in Parliament when she won the Norwich North by-election in 2009, was promoted last weekend to become Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the mini reshuffle that followed Liam Fox’s resignation.

Rise: Miss Chloe Smith with Prime Minister David Cameron, who appears to have been confused about her credentials

At the age of 29 years, four months and 27 days, she became the youngest minister in government, marking an unparalleled ascent to the political frontline.

However, according to an account of the phone call giving her the good news, the Prime Minister was under the misapprehension that she had been a chartered accountant and would therefore be well suited to the post.

After Mr Cameron told Miss Smith he would like to offer her the post, she is said to have replied: ‘Well, thank you Prime Minister. . .It would be an honour, but the Treasury…it’s a little daunting…’ 

The Prime Minister allegedly responded: ‘Not daunting surely for someone who was a chartered accountant?’

The confusion may have arisen because the MP, an English literature graduate, worked for accountancy firm Deloitte before entering politics, but as a consultant not an accountant

The Norwich North MP is then said to have admitted: ‘Er, well, actually Prime Minister, I wasn’t an accountant. I was a management consultant in an accountancy firm.’

Mr Cameron apparently then said ‘never mind’ and welcomed Miss Smith aboard.

Miss Smith’s promotion has delighted her friends – including Chancellor George Osborne – but angered some older MPs.

One male minister described Miss Smith’s appointment as a ‘gimmick’ that was too obviously made in response to Ed Miliband’s recent Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, which saw a clutch of young female Labour MPs promoted.

‘I’m afraid this shows the shallowness with which Number Ten makes appointments,’ the minister said.

‘The intake that has been at this for 15 or 20 years has held the party together.

'These are people who actually have quite a lot of experience and David will find that he can’t keep on passing them over.’

Miss Smith admitted she was ‘surprised’ to be elevated to the Government.

But she added: ‘I am also very happy and very proud.

'It feels quick to me but I’m pleased to have the Prime Minister’s confidence.’ 

And her allies brushed aside criticism of her appointment as jealousy.

Elizabeth
Truss, Tory MP for South West Norfolk, said: ‘She’s very competent, 
very trustworthy  and very energetic and I think it’s  a great 
opportunity for her and for the Treasury.’

Miss Smith unexpectedly won her seat in the 2009 by-election with a majority of more than 7,000, after popular Labour MP Dr Ian Gibson quit Parliament, and held it at last year’s general election.
