The Welsh Rugby Union are in fantasy land at the start of 2014, with their domestic game crumbling in front of them.

The union’s conduct in the bitter conflict with the regions amounts to a dereliction of duty and an act of wanton vandalism.

When Regional Rugby Wales confirmed on New Year’s Eve that they would not sign a new participation agreement, it was an understandable stance given the lack of clarity about so many details.

Yet, the WRU’s response was extraordinary – hinting that they are ready to cut the Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets adrift, and create new professional teams.

It is the latest example of gun-boat diplomacy in a turbulent season for European rugby.

The regions are culpable to an extent, in failing to establish a firm basis for sustainable businesses and being over-reliant on central funding.

However, the four teams have produced a stream of talented players for Wales and the WRU’s reaction now is a power-play that could drive the regions to oblivion. Yet, their alternative vision is ludicrously far-fetched.

After a meeting of the union’s board on Thursday, it was announced that they will soon present the regions with a new draft agreement, understood to contain a tiered payment scheme based on the creation and retention of Test players.

But, if this ploy fails, it is thought that the WRU’s fall-back plan is to create new professional teams, potentially based in Neath, Pontypridd, Colwyn Bay and at the Millennium Stadium.

This sporting miracle must take place in six months, to support the WRU pledge to ensure Welsh sides continue to participate in the Pro 12 and European tournaments.

All they have to do is rustle up 120-150 players capable of competing at that level, four bona fide coaching line-ups, back-room staff, officials, sponsors, suppliers… oh, and crowds. No chance.

All the indications are that the Welsh public will view any such teams as unwelcome imposters and will greet them with hostility and indifference.

Meanwhile, the existing regions will be barred by the WRU from forming a break-away Anglo-Welsh league. All the top stars coming out of contract will join the exodus abroad and hordes of gifted players will be left in career limbo.

The new sides will be routed week after week in front of empty stands and without local heroes to inspire them, the nation’s gaze will be drawn even more emphatically to football, probably never to return.

That is the reality of the WRU’s fantasy vision.

Last week, this column lamented the steady erosion of club loyalty in the game, so how fitting that there should be an immediate antidote to such a doomsday perspective.

While Gloucester are resigned to losing Freddie Burns to Leicester, they confirmed on Thursday that their veteran wing, James Simpson-Daniel, has agreed a new contract to continue his 13-year association with the West Country club.

‘Sinbad’ has been one of the finest attacking players of the era at club level, even if an endless catalogue of injuries have cruelly undermined his England career.

He is currently recovering from a fracture-dislocation of the left ankle and all those who revel in the sight of a free-spirit flier carving up defences will await his next comeback with great anticipation.

Tip-tackle rulings make no sense

Apologies for returning to a well-worn gripe, but officiating of tip-tackles has become a blight on the game and Harlequins’ Big Game against Exeter provided fresh evidence of a lack of commonsense.

First, Matt Hopper picked up Jason Shoemark and dropped him on his back, but avoided a card despite conceding a penalty.

Later, Jack Nowell lifted Hopper’s legs above the level of his head, but then recognised the danger and lowered his legs down carefully, while the Quins centre used an arm to cushion his fall.

Yet, the Exeter wing received a yellow card for his actions, and he wasn’t the only one to be stunned by the decision.

There MUST be common sense applied, rather than a one-size-fits-all formula. Legs being raised above a 90-degree angle shouldn’t be an automatic trigger for disciplinary action, provided what follows is safe.

A ball-carrier whose legs are lifted 95 degrees then lowered carefully is surely less at risk than one whose legs don’t quite reach the horizontal, but is then dropped on to their spine.

Events on of New Year’s Day must surely have dismissed any lingering doubts about the wisdom of more so-called ‘plastic’ pitches being installed at club grounds – and at Test arenas too.

The Pro12 League witnessed a tale of two surfaces amid a wet festive period, as Cardiff Blues’ game against the Dragons went ahead, while Glasgow’s clash with Edinburgh was cancelled at short notice.

The pitch at Scotstoun couldn’t cope with the monsoon, but that wasn’t a problem in the Welsh capital, now that the Arms Park has a state-of-the-art, 4G synthetic surface.

It cost £400,000 to install but it is money well spent – with the Blues and the community already enjoying the benefits. The same can be said of Saracens, who started the trend at their Allianz Park ground.

After several recent Tests were disrupted by mud and torn turf, the artificial option should be embraced urgently.

Yet, there is a reluctance to go down the synthetic route at the Millennium Stadium because officials there want to bring the Champions League Final to Cardiff and to do so; they must provide a grass pitch.

The last word...

The RFU are investigating Richard Cockerill’s comments after the Leicester v Sale match last Saturday and the Tigers’ director of rugby faces the threat of a disrepute charge.

He has also faced fierce criticism in some quarters, but not here. He accused Sale of setting out to ‘cheat, cheat and cheat again’ in the scrum and in response, his counterpart from the Cheshire club, Steve Diamond, insinuated that Leicester break the salary cap.

Despite that claim being denied by the Tigers, Diamond later repeated it. The match has generated a classic ‘war of words’, which in turn generates tribal rivalry, passion and coverage, so where’s the harm?

Both Cockerill and Diamond should have every right to speak their mind honestly. Such sparring between coaches brings straight-talking colour to a game increasingly dominated by bland platitudes.

Every opposition is lethal, every defeat is a vital lesson with ‘positives’, every controversy prompts treading on egg-shells. To hell with all that, let’s have more shooting from the hip to enliven proceedings.

Even negative comments about referees should be permissible providing they are qualified, rather than just a scatter-gun attempt to deflect blame.
