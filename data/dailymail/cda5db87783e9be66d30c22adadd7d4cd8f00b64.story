A Wednesday morning bomb threat has led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and early dismissal of all students.

Monroe Police Lt. Brian McCauley says the threat was called in to the school at 9:30 a.m. and the evacuation was ordered as a precaution.

He says the school building and grounds were checked and no evidence of danger was found.

Sick: A Wednesday morning bomb threat has led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Students went home early from the school in Monroe, which has temporarily served Newtown students since their school was razed after the 2012 massacre

Nancy Bartosik of the Monroe superintendent's office says the school was dismissed early and students moved to a nearby school to be picked up by their parents. 

'Sandy Hook will dismiss at noontime because of a low to no threat scare,' Newtown Superintendent of Schools Dr. Joseph V. Erardi Jr. told parents in a recorded statement, according to WFSB.

'All students are safe, all staff are safe, everyone is absolutely fine,' it said. The scare is being investigated, the message said. 

The former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, Connecticut was repurposed for use by Sandy Hook students after their school in Newtown became the backdrop for America's most horrific school shooting to date in 2012. 

Erardi planned a meeting for 7pm at Sandy hook high where parents could air questions and concerns over the day's events and the school's response. 

A gunman killed 20 first-grade students and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. The students resumed classes in a school in the neighboring town of Monroe, also called Sandy Hook Elementary School. The original school building was torn down last year.

Terrible legacy: A gunman killed 20 first-grade students and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. The students resumed classes in a school in the neighboring town of Monroe, also called Sandy Hook Elementary School. The original school building was torn down last year

The Newtown building was razed in the wake of the tragedy, which left 20 children fatally shot along with six educators. 

This is not the first phoned threat made in relation to Newtown, Massacre.

In the days after after Adam Lanza's rampage, prosecutors say a Venezuelan man named Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman made sick, prank calls to already terrorized Newtown residents.

Cardenas allegedly made the threatening calls two days after the December 2012 shootings.  

Authorities say that in a few calls, he claimed to be the shooter and threatened to kill the person he called.

'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna (expletive) kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead,' the caller said, according to authorities. In another phone call, Cardenas is accused of saying: 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. With my machine gun. You're dead (expletive).'

The St. Rose of Lima Church in Newtown received a bogus bomb threat the Sunday after the massacre, which forced congregants to go home just as they'd gathered to help one another start to heal.
