Christmas is Crusoe the celebrity dachshund's favourite time of year, and unwrapping presents is what really makes this camera-loving diva dog most happy.

That and getting together with his extended family including brother Oakley, says owner Ryan Beauchesne, who's made a star of his dog with an award-winning blog.

The festive period plays right into the hands of Crusoe, who celebrated the signing of his first book deal while on a trip to New York, sealing the deal with his pawtograph.

With plenty to celebrate, Crusoe, who has over 82,000 likes on Facebook, also has a chance to parade in his extensive collection of winter outfits and frolic in the snow, as seen in the below video.

In addition to the book deal Crusoe has a host of merchandise available online, including mugs, T-shirts, bumper stickers and even a calendar that can be 'autographed'.

And he definitely knows what time of year it is, says Ryan, 27, who lives with Crusoe and his girlfriend Laurence Dionne, 27, in Ottawa, Canada. 

Showing great restraint, Crusoe enjoys the smell of another Christmas creation in custom oven mitts

While a busy dog, Crusoe knows how to relax - in a fleece, on the sofa, by the fire will do just fine

'He's seen us wrap presents already and we already have a Christmas tree with a few gifts under there,' Ryan told MailOnline.

'Now he's just waiting for the day we give him the "OK" to start opening them. Plus he's been seeing a lot of family members lately so I'm sure he knows there's the big day coming.'

Family happy snaps from last year show Crusoe trying his hand in the kitchen and supervising the cooking of the turkey, for which the end result is quite important to him. 

Of course, being a dog and all, knives and hot plates aren't for him. But eating sure is with is favourites being turkey and ham.

'They're pretty good bets,' says Ryan. 'He enjoys a nice sautéed carrot as well. All in all, he's not too picky as long as it's not too healthy.'

When it comes to the time for presents the dog that seems so well-behaved on camera unleashes fury - in a cute, happy way - on anything covered with wrapping paper, including his presents from Santa, his mum and dad, and those intended for everyone else.  

'Santa sends him some of course. He has a big long wishlist we have to send to Santa on his behalf every year,' says Ryan.

'He definitely opens all his own presents. It's his favourite part of the holidays.

'He'll even start opening random presents under the tree, even when they're not for him. He seems to think every present is for him - which I guess is a reasonable assumption on his part being a celebrity and all.'

Believe it or not, Crusoe's owner Ryan says the dachshund quite likes carrots, but not as much as ham

For this year's Christmas, Crusoe is hanging out with Oakley, who lives just outside Toronto, about 300 miles from Ottawa.

'We have all the family coming together, including his brother Oakley, who he really doesn't get to see very often.

'Crusoe loves when all the family's together. In fact, I think that's when he's most content in life.'
