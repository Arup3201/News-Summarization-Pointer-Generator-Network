Leanne Nicholson swindled nearly £300,000 from two of her elderly clients

A financial adviser who befriended pensioners and cheated them out of nearly £300,000 has been jailed for two years.

Leanne Nicholson appeared to live an affluent lifestyle, running her business from her £600,000 five-bed luxury home in an upmarket neighbourhood.

But the 47-year-old ran into financial problems when her business failed - and she took £290,000 off her clients, knowing she would be unable to pay it back, to fund a lavish lifestyle saw her drive a top of the range Lexus SUV and rent a grand piano for her home.

Derby Crown Court was told the men, one in his 90s who had just lost his wife, the other in his 80s, were both 'flattered by her attentions'.

The younger victim said the fraud left him feeling 'like he wanted to die'.

Nicholson became a trusted friend to the men, who were clients of hers.

She met regularly with them in their homes and would send them Christmas cards. One remembered when she turned up with a flask of coffee and an egg sandwich.

But prosecutor David Allan said Nicholson 'subverted the trust' of the vulnerable men.

He said: 'She persuaded two of her elderly clients to loan her £290,000 in several tranches over two years. 

'By 2010, at the latest, her finances were such that she must have known there was a serious risk she could not repay the loans and therefore her actions were dishonest.

'She has now been declared bankrupt and it appears that her old clients will never recover the vast majority of what they lent her.'.'

Derby Crown Court was told the men, one in his 90s who had just lost his wife, the other in his 80s, were both 'flattered by her attentions'. The younger victim said the fraud left him feeling 'like he wanted to die'

The court heard the older victim gave her money that had been left by his late wife, and was intended for his children.

The victim, who was frail, was defrauded of £80,000.

He
 told police he felt 'a fool' and his daughter said: 'My father feels he
 was the custodian of my mother’s estate... and feels he has failed his 
children.'

Mr Allan said the other victim lost £210,000.

The prosecutor said he now feared he would have to sell his house to pay off a £61,000 tax bill incurred by cashing in an investment bond in order to give Nicholson the money.

Police launched an investigation after family members of one of the victims contacted trading standards.

The court heard that Nicholson formerly of Derbyshire had used the money to pay off personal and business debts

Nicholson, who claimed she had intended to pay back all the money, pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by abuse of position committed in 2010 and 2011. 

Before she was sentenced, she described the affair as a 'very distressing episode' in her life and there had been a 'pernicious and relentless pursuit' to prove her dishonesty.

She said: 'The sooner this phase is concluded, the sooner I can work towards putting things right and reimbursing the individuals affected.'

But Recorder Andrew Smith QC said she had been told in 2011 her business had been poorly administered and, in effect, insolvent.

Sentencing her to two years and four months in jail, he said: 'You substantially abused your position as an independent financial adviser.

'The effect of your offending is not to be underestimated, you have caused them (the victims) stress and anxiety and introduced uncertainty into their lives and that of their families.

'One of the victims told police your actions had made him want to die and these events had ruined his life.'

Philip Bown, in mitigation, said Nicholson had abused her position, but it was not her intention to permanently deprive them.

'There isn’t any indication that Leanne Nicholson in any way wanted to cover up the financial arrangements that had been arrived at between her and the two unfortunately elderly clients,' he said.

'She is deeply sorry, her remorse is palpable,' he added.

A compensation hearing will take place at a later date to see if bankrupt Nicholson now of Duffield, Derbyshire, is in a position to pay any money back to her victims.
