Southampton's World Cup star Luke Shaw said he was ‘gutted’ on Tuesday night after two of the club’s highly rated Under 18 coaches were fired.

Les Reed, who is now executive director at  St Mary’s, approved the decision to sack former Southampton players Jason Dodd and Paul Williams as part of his battle for control of the club’s academy.

Farewell: Southampton left-back Luke Shaw, whose career was overseen by Dodd and Williams, posted this message on Twitter

Not happy: Shaw then replied to a post by BBC reporter Adam Blackmore by saying 'wrong decision'

Southampton’s academy is widely 
regarded as one of the best in Europe and the decision to axe the two 
respected coaches has sent shockwaves through the club.

Dodd
 and Williams are responsible for bringing through Shaw, James  
Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers, Harry Reed and Sam Gallagher among others.

Most
 of them have largely  by-passed Martin Hunter’s Under 21 team and 
graduated directly from Dodd and Williams’ Under 18 team to the first 
team. Hunter’s big ally at the club is Reed.

Shaw, who is in Portugal with England’s World Cup squad, tweeted his disappointment on Tuesday.

The
 left back, who is leaving Southampton this summer, said it was the 
wrong decision to sack the popular pair. Dodd, who made nearly 400 
appearances for Saints, has been left stunned by the decision to fire 
him.

England Under 19 star. James Ward-ProwseMidfielder, also 19, who has been a regular in Southampton's team this season and plays for England Under 21s. Harry ReedMidfielder who has made a handful of first team appearances this season and has been capped by England at Under 19 level. Sam Gallagher Striker who made 16 league appearances for Southampton this season and is also an England Under 19 international.

Incredibly, the duo were  told to report to the club on Monday and informed of their fate by interim academy director Matt Hale.

Williams,
 regarded by the academy players and their parents as one of the best 
coaches in the country at that level, was told he didn’t spend enough 
time with the players.

Dodd was informed that he was being sacked because his relationship with Hunter was not healthy.

There
 has been friction at the club between academy staff and coaches since 
January as they bicker over the direction of the academy.

The sackings have been met with disbelief at St Mary’s as the club  head into a summer of uncertainty.

Shaw
 is leaving Southampton when he returns from the World Cup with England 
and captain Adam Lallana has also made it clear he is quitting the  club
 when he returns from South America.

Dejan
 Lovren, who was outstanding in his  first season with Southampton, will
 agitate to leave if they start selling their best players.

On April 25, Reed  declared that the club will not sell any key players this summer.
