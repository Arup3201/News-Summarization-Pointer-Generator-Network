The jailed drug-dealing boss of a clothing racket faces ruin after he and his family were ordered to pay back more than £400,000 of the profits of their criminal enterprises.

Mohammed Basit Chaudhry, 26, was convicted last year of running a counterfeit clothing racket and trafficking cannabis after raids on his family home in Chorlton, Manchester.

He had boasted of his ill-gotten gains by posing for a picture waving a thick wad of £10 notes, prompting comparisons with the 'Loadsamoney' character played by Harry Enfield in the Eighties.

The photo - taken on a holiday in Dubai - showed him wearing a gold-striped hooded tracksuit jacket, baseball cap and D&G bag as he pointed at the bundle of cash, said to be worth £20,000.

Police found the incriminating picture on Chaudhry's phone after searches at the opulently furnished and newly renovated £200,000 semi-detached home where he lived with his brother and parents.

Inquiries revealed the Chaudhrys - who wore expensive clothing, designer watches and holidayed in exotic locations - operated as a crime family.

During the investigation police discovered fake clothing worth £250,000 and over seven kilograms of cannabis, which they estimated had a street value of around £70,000.

Today Greater Manchester Police said that a financial investigation into the Chaudhrys had found they had made more £2.5million from their rackets.

But based on available assets they have available to them now, the family have been ordered to pay back a total of just £423,942.36.

Chaudhry faces extra jail time if he fails to pay of his £14,155 share of the proceeds within three months. All the family's properties have already been sold and their leased cars returned.

Detective Constable Pete Fawcett, 
said: 'Thanks to the POCA ruling and the cash and property already 
restrained, the Chaudhry family will have more than £423,000 stripped 
from them.

'We have closed 
down their criminal businesses and they have been forced to sell their 
properties and one of the family members had to return her top of the 
range Mercedes to the leasing company.

'This
 is money they have made from the counterfeit goods and drug trade and 
demonstrates that we will continue our investigations even when someone 
has been sentenced and jailed.

'Greater
 Manchester Police is determined to bring those involved in criminality 
to justice and if anyone has benefited financially they can expect to be
 stripped of their assets.'

His father Abdul Hamid Chaudhry, 59, was jailed after admitting to conspiracy to sell counterfeit goods and money laundering, while his mother Shahnuz Akhtar Chaudhry, 57, was jailed after admitting mortgage fraud

The family’s crime empire was smashed 
after a two year investigation by the police during which numerous raids
 were carried out on the family home between 2009 and 2011.

The
 first occurred in February 2009 when officers seized more than £26,000 
and almost five kilograms of Lidocaine, a cutting agent for cocaine.

The
 following January further raids carried out at clothing trading firms 
owned by Chaudhry's father, Abdul Hamid Chaudhry, and about seven 
kilograms of cannabis was seized.

In
 the business premises of Abdul’s firm Merit Smart, boxes of counterfeit
 clothing were found and a computer was seized, which when examined 
showed recent searches related to drug supply and importation.

Following
 further unconnected intelligence, another raid was carried out at the 
family home on May 14, 2010, and a counter surveillance scanner, phones 
and a camera were seized.

The
 phones were examined and contained a photograph of a large cannabis 
cultivation and photographs of the family holidaying in Dubai and 
Pakistan.

A raid at a different property uncovered a quantity of cannabis along with high value watches.

Also sent to jail: Chaudhry's bankrupt brother Mohammed Kamran Chaudhry, 30, was jailed for two years after admitting conspiracy to sell counterfeit goods and money laundering

On June 8, 2011, 42 cartons of GHD gift sets were seized worth approximately £65,000. The paperwork also found related to Gino Trading, a clothing firm run by Mohammed Basit Chaudhry.

Police then carried out a further eight raids on the same day in November 2011 across Chorlton, Prestwich, Stretford and Cheetham Hill.

They found £15,000 in cash, a large amount of high value jewellery and another counter surveillance scanner.

On February 11, 2012, Gino Trading itself was searched and three boxes of clothing were seized. The clothing within the boxes was examined by Trading Standards officers who confirmed they were counterfeit goods.

Officers from Trading Standards later again raided Merit Smart and searched the first floor room and found 190 boxes of counterfeit goods. A further search of Gino trading was carried out and 120 boxes were seized.

In February last year, at Manchester Crown Court, Mohammed Basit Chaudhry was jailed for three years and four months after he pleaded guilty to possessing class B drugs with intent to supply and money laundering.

His bankrupt brother Mohammed Kamran Chaudhry, 30, was jailed for two years after admitting conspiracy to sell counterfeit goods and money laundering.

Their businessman father Abdul Hamid Chaudhry, 59, was jailed for 20 months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell counterfeit goods and money laundering.

Their mother Shahnuz Akhtar Chaudhry, 57, was jailed for ten weeks after admitting mortgage fraud.
