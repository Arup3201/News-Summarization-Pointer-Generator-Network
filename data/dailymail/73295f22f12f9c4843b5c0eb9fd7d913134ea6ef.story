David Cameron backed a Government review into Britain's seagull menace – after a bird once stole the ham from his sandwich.

The Prime Minister insisted he had nothing against 'the entire seagull population', despite committing £250,000 in the Budget to tackling the scourge of Britain's seaside towns.

An 'urban seagull' research fund will be used to find a solution for the noise, mess, disease and aggression caused by the birds.

Despite efforts from local councils including using artificial eggs and experimenting with stronger refuse bags, the gull population in the UK is thought to have grown to more than a quarter of a million breeding pairs.

Last year, councils in the seaside resorts of Exmouth, Sidmouth and Seaton in Devon spent £15,000 on specially-bred 'super falcons' to try to stop seagulls from disturbing residents and tourists.

In 2013, Royal Mail said postmen would not deliver in a street in the Cornish coastal town of Perranporth after being injured by the swooping birds who dive-bomb and peck at their heads.

Asked whether he had ever been attacked by seagulls, the Prime Minister told the Western Morning News he had never felt 'particularly oppressed by seagulls'.

But he revealed: 'In my distant past I remember some seagulls taking the ham out of a sandwich. But I haven't held that against the entire seagull population since.'

Bath MP Don Foster, who held a 'seagull summit' in Parliament in 2012, said: 'Urban gulls cause mess, noise and damage to property, and are very aggressive in the nesting season.

'There is not enough data to enable a strategic approach to the problem, and I have long been pressing for funding to be given so that progress can be made.'

Labour have claimed the seagull fund and other small measures in the Budget are little more than 'pork barrel politics' aimed at winning over marginal seats have been dismissed by the coalition.

At least 16 marginal constituencies benefited from measures in the Budget, including £97 million for regeneration in Brent Cross, which straddles the ultra-marginal Hendon constituency where Conservative MP Matthew Offord has a majority of 106.

Lib Dem sources insisted the seagull study was aimed at tackling the problem nationwide and the Treasury said the Chancellor had set out economic plans for every region in the country.

Mr Foster has campaigned for action to be taken to tackle the 'menace' since before the Lib Dems entered government and hosted a 'seagull summit' three years ago.

A Liberal Democrat source said: 'It's just silly stuff from an Opposition trying to cause mischief.

'Urban seagulls are a serious issue across the country and Don Foster has fought a campaign to get a proper study done so they can be properly dealt with.'

A Treasury spokesman said: 'From investing £13 billion to improving transport across of the whole of the north of England to introducing 20 housing zones around the country to keep Britain building, from day one this Government has been committed to building a truly national recovery to close the long-term gaps between the north and south, London and the rest.

'The Chancellor has set out long-term economic plans for every region to make sure that Britain's prosperity is shared across the country and the Budget took this even further with ambitious investment in a wide range of areas like enterprise zones, flood defence and science to ensure that no industry and no region is left behind.'
