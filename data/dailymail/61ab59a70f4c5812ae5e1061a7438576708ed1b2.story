A would-be copper thief was killed by a massive electric shock when he shot down a live power line and then picked it up.

Dalton Newhouse, 22, of Oak Hill, West Virginia, was killed instantly when he touched the live cable, which sent thousands of volts pulsing through his body.

He was found by police in Fayette County tangled in the cables that they believe he was intending to sell as scrap metal.

Fayette deputies and rangers from the National Parks Service found the Mr Newhouse's body on Wednesday morning in the Berry Mountain Wildlife Management Area near Thurmond.

They also arrested Charles Norris, 22, of Oak Hill, in connection with the incident.

Officers believe the dead man and his accomplice used a rifle to shoot down the lines, and that the man who died must have touched a live line at some point, causing electrocution.

Norris was charged with attempt to commit a felony, conspiracy to commit a felony and disruption of a public utility.

Fayette County Sheriff Steve Kessler said the pair had intended to strip the power line of its copper wiring to later sell as scrap metal.

Mr Newhouse's body was sent to the West Virginia Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy.
