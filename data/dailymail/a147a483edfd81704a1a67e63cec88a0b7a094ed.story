Nigella Lawson admitted that she started seeing Charles Saatchi 'not very long' after the death of her first husband, as she gave evidence to a jury for a second day.

Miss Lawson, 53, married Mr Saatchi in 2003 just two years after John Diamond died from cancer at the age of 47.

The self-styled Domestic Goddess told Isleworth Crown Court that she snorted cocaine with Mr Diamond six times in the last two years of his life while he was terminally ill.

After they took the Class A drug together, she told the jury she didn't take it again until 2010 when Mr Saatchi had subjected her to 'intimate terrorism'.

Miss Lawson is giving evidence against her former PAs Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo who are accused of spending £685,000 on themselves using the millionaire art dealer's company credit cards.

She told the jury today that she 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after Mr Diamond passed away.

'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she said.

Re-married: Nigella Lawson married Charles Saatchi in 2003, two years after Mr Diamond died, the jury has been told

Miss Lawson married journalist John Diamond in 1992 in a ceremony in Venice and they later had two children together.

But he was diagnosed with throat cancer and died in 2001 after a four-year battle against the disease.

To relieve his pain, he turned to cocaine and Miss Lawson said she also snorted the drug.

She told the jury yesterday: 'I did speak to a doctor of 
palliative care because I was troubled about whether I should let John 
continue, and he said just let him. And so I didn't judge or begrudge.'

But
 she said claims that credit cards and envelopes containing white powder
 were left around the home she shared with Mr Diamond in Shepherds Bush, west London, were 'completely 
false'.

She added: 'He didn't take it for very long because there are some miseries you cannot escape.

'You asked me if there were rolled up notes with white powder at the desk and I said no.

'The idea that he would let his study become squalid is unbelievable.

'I
 did take it in a rolled up note, but there were not rolled up notes 
everywhere. It is something that everyone knows, that cocaine is taken 
like that. It is a very easy story to fabricate.

'It is not true.'

Jurors have been told that Elisabetta Grillo started working for Miss Lawson in 1999 as Mr Diamond battled the illness.

She was initially brought in as an au pair to look after her children after Mr Diamond had been diagnosed with cancer. 

Testimony: Nigella Lawson arrives at court this morning to continue giving evidence against her two former PAs. Yesterday she revealed she took cocaine

Her sister Francesca was recruited in 2001 and, although their role changed over the years, they stayed with the TV chef for the duration of her marriage to Mr Saatchi.

Miss Lawson told the jury yesterday that Lisa had been a 'rock' when Mr Diamond was terminally ill with cancer.

'Sometimes I had to rush to hospital, she would stand in,' she told the court. 'She was my rock. I will never forget what she did for my family.'

Francesca
 Grillo, 35, and her sister Elisabetta, 
41, are accused of committing fraud by abusing their positions by using a
 company credit card for personal gain.

Prosecutors
 claim the Italian sisters lived the 'high life', spending the money on 
designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and 
Vivienne Westwood.

The pair 
are accused of using credit cards loaned to them by the TV cook and her 
ex-husband to spend more than £685,000 on themselves between 2008 and 
2012.

The Grillo sisters, of Bayswater, west London, deny the charge against them.

The case continues.
