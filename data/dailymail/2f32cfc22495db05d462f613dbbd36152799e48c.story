James Bond has entered into mortal combat with some of the world’s most dangerous criminals on countless occasions – yet always beats the odds and walks away with his life.

Now one eagle-eyed fan has calculated the exact probability of 007 dodging death so many times – and come to the conclusion he should have died years ago.

Gordon Stanger worked out that the spy had been shot at a staggering 4,662 times since the first film, Dr No, in 1962.

Death defying: Daniel Craig, pictured in 2006's Casino Royale, is one of several Bonds to have improbably dodged death over the years

The survival of James Bonds like Piers Brosnan is all the more surprising given the spy normally, unlike this picture, finds himself unarmed when faced with death

He then estimated there was a 5 per cent chance of the spy being fatally wounded on each occasion. Expressed mathematically, this means the chance of Bond not getting killed is 1.4 x 10 to the power of minus 104, or in Mr Stanger’s words, ‘as close to zero as makes no difference’.

When you take into account the 130 other attempts on Bond’s life that did not involve being shot at, the chances of him surviving are even slimmer.

There have been 22 official Bond movies and the attempts on 007’s life have grown increasingly sinister.

In the 1964 film Goldfinger, Bond was handcuffed to a ticking bomb and strapped to a table underneath a giant laser.

Mr Stanger estimates that over the years James Bond (played by Roger Moore, left, and Sean Connery, right) has killed 198 of his enemies in the films

When the agent asks: ‘Do you expect me to talk?’ the film’s eponymous villain replies: ‘No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die.’

Bond’s survival rate is even more staggering when you consider he is rarely armed when he finds himself in a fight to the death.

His survival is often due to his use of household appliances, such as lamps or abandoned objects.

Mr Stanger, who lives in the Solomon Islands, also estimates that Britain’s most famous agent has killed 198 of his enemies in the films.

Mr Stanger constructed his formula after New Scientist magazine asked its readers to work out what was the probability of Bond still being alive.

The 23rd Bond film, Skyfall, which will star Daniel Craig, Dame Judi Dench and Naomie Harris, is currently being filmed.
