Reinforcements: Staff from bungling firm G4S are believed to have been hired to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile (pictured) sex scandal

The BBC is setting aside a staggering £10 million to cover the cost of the three inquiries set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Lawyers’ fees will account for most of the final bill but details released under the Freedom of Information Act show that a public relations firm, a corporate investigations company and a transcribing service, which charges almost £1,000 a day, are also involved.

The Pollard Review, chaired by ex-Sky News chief Nick Pollard, examined why Newsnight’s Savile investigation in 2011 was axed.

It reported last December, when acting director-general Tim Davie claimed it would cost £2 million.

The two other inquiries are looking at the Corporation’s culture and practices during Savile’s career, and past sexual harassment claims. 

The BBC said: ‘It has already been stated that the overall cost of the Pollard inquiry is likely to be approximately £2 million.

‘We will be publishing details of the costs once figures are finalised.’

Nineteen witnesses, including ex-BBC director-general George Entwistle, were allowed up to £50,000 of legal advice for the Pollard Review.

News of the potential cost of the inquiries comes a day after it was revealed the company behind a security debacle at last summer's London Olympics has been drafted in to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal.

G4S, the firm that could only partly 
fulfill its contract to supply security guards at the Games, will 
reportedly make £250,000 to hire staff to assist police dealing with 
'unprecedented workloads' as a result of Operation Yewtree.

Around 20 extra staff are said to be starting 'imminently' to help with the inquiry.

Reed Specialist Recruitment are believed to be recruiting retired detectives from the G4S Policing Solutions arm.

A
statement issued by the Metropolitan Police said: 'We can confirm 
SC&O5 are to take on a number of external individuals via Reed 
Specialist Recruitment to assist with a wide range of work across the 
command.

'This is in line 
with the policy of the organisation whereby we may call upon the 
experience of appropriate external parties to assist with cases where 
unique and specialist knowledge can enhance the investigation.

'Individuals
are selected by the employment agency Reed Specialist Recruitment who 
hold the contract for the supply of all temporary agency workers.

'Due
to the unprecedented current workloads of the command created as a 
result of the Jimmy Saville inquiry, there is a need to take on 
additional staff. '

According
to the Met, the hired staff will be undertaking a variety of roles and 
will be security checked before being put forward for roles.

There are currently 30 police officers working in the SC&O5 unit working on Operation Yewtree.

Loss: The company was reportedly at a loss of around £70million following the Olympics security debacle

G4S
hit the headlines after failing to fulfill its £240million contract 
with Locog to provide 10,400 security guards at the Olympic Park and 
other venues.

The company's failure forced the Government to draft in members of the Armed Forces to help cover gaps.

Both chief Operating Officer David 
Taylor-Smith and head of global events Ian Horseman Sewell resigned in 
the wake of the shambles.

G4S is said to have made a loss of around £70million as a result of the fiasco.
