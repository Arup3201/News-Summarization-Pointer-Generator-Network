A millionaire's wife has won a landmark bid to have her prenuptial agreement torn up after a judge ruled she was forced into signing it.

Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis, 37, from Long Island, claims her tycoon husband coerced her into accepting the document four days before their lavish wedding in June 1998.

In an 'unprecedented' ruling last month,  an  appellate panel decided Peter Petrakis, 41, had 'fraudulently induced' his wife to sign and that his 'credibility was suspect.'

Claims: Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis, 37, from Long Island, claims her husband Peter Petrakis, 41, coerced her into signing the document four days before their luxury wedding in June 1998

There are general principles of prenups that work across all American States however each State can introduce the way in which they will set aside prenups generally- some States follow the English common law, others do not.

Prenuptial agreements are drawn up before the marriage takes place so that the parties are contractually bound to deal with certain matters if the marriage breaks down.

In order to be legal binding the parties
will have to have had legal advice on it, and financial disclosure in 
most States and most importantly would have had time to have considered 
it together with their lawyers. Prenups that are signed on the day of 
the wedding or the day before, will likely to be set aside.

The usual prenups will deal with:-

Calling the document 'a knife in my heart from Day One,' she testified that Mr Petrakis threatened to cancel the wedding if 
she didn’t sign the agreement, reported the New York Post. 

He made the threat even though her father already paid out 
$40,000 for their reception.

The agreement stated that Mr Petrakis would keep everything in his name if they split up.

He had transformed a string of smoke shops into a $20 million commercial 
real-estate empire. 

Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis said her husband promised to 'tear up' the document after the couple had children.

He also vowed
to put their Old Brookville home under both their names.

But Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis, who is a stay at home mother, said that he failed to carry out his promise, even after they couple had twin sons and a daughter.

On February 20, a Brooklyn Appellate Court panel unanimously affirmed two Nassau County court decisions, saying Mr Petrakis, 'fraudulently induced' his wife to sign the prenuptial agreement and found his 'credibility to be suspect.'

Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis' lawyer, Dennis 
D’Antonio said the decision 'is unprecedented, vacating a pre-nup on the
basis of a verbal promise,' even though a clause in the contract says 
there were no verbal promises.

'It
resets the bar. It’s an entirely different landscape out there in 
regard to prenups. I’ve been inundated with calls. Spouses who are 
challenging pre-nups now have a leg to stand on,' Ms D’Antonio said.

The pair will now begin divorce proceedings.

Sometimes acting as her own lawyer during the proceedings Cioffi-Petrakis
now heads up her own company called Divorce Prep Experts which counsels
people divorcing with prenuptial agreements.

The company promises to 'help one of the most overlooked groups in our population, those facing divorce.'

In
a video posted on the website she is seen holding signs up to the 
camera reading 'Divorce has robbed me' and 'I am a victim.'

She also appeared on national television
after being interviewed on the Anderson Cooper show about her story and
her new business.

The case will hold significance for many Americans who are fighting prenupital agreements.

Long-term divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd Platt who was not involved in the case said of the ruling: 'This new case however of Elizabeth 
Cioffi-Petrakis introduces a new principle in America that if there has 
been a misrepresentation ie he was said to have fraudulently induced the
wife to sign the prenup on the basis that he would put the house in her
name and would make certain provision for her and did not, it will be 
set aside. 

'What this means is if the husband makes a promise that 
induces the prenup and does not keep it, it is now open to the American 
Courts to set aside the prenup.  This is very new and very 
controversial.'

Ex-Baywatch star David Hasselhoff got Pamela Bach to sign a prenup 30 minutes before their wedding ceremony

Ex-Baywatch star David Hasselhoff got Pamela Bach to sign a prenup 30 minutes before their wedding ceremony.

Says Pamela, ‘I was in a room at the back of the church… our guests were already seated. I didn’t have my lawyer present, nor did I realise that I was being presented with a signature page related to the prenuptial agreement.’ When they divorced, the prenup didn’t stand up in court.

Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, who married in 2006, allegedly signed a prenup that would give Katie £22 million if they divorce.

Rachel Hunter signed one before marrying Rod Stewart in 1990 and is said to have got less than £5 million from his £100 million fortune when they divorced in 2006.

Peter Andre insisted on signing a prenup (‘I don’t want anything from her apart from love’) when he married Katie Price in 2005, but could challenge it now, as they have since had two children together. He has said, ‘I wouldn’t get a penny if we broke up because I signed a prenup — and it was my idea.’

Carla Bruni, born into one of Italy’s wealthiest families, signed a prenup when she married French president Nicolas Sarkozy. She will ‘take out of the marriage what she arrived with’ if they divorce.

Catherine Zeta Jones married Michael Douglas in 2000. She would get at least £1 million for each year of their marriage, and a fidelity clause would see her paid millions if he were to stray. She has said, ‘Prenups are brilliant. I get taken care of very well.’No deal: who didn't have a contract

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston tied the knot in 2000. Their divorce settlement in 2006 was split fairly evenly

Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills married in 2002. He paid out a £24.3 million settlement following one of the most acrimonious divorce battles in recent history.

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston tied the knot in 2000. Their divorce settlement in 2006 was split fairly evenly, with Jennifer keeping their Beverly Hills mansion and Brad getting control of their movie production company.

Roseanne Barr was so in love with Tom Arnold before their 1990 wedding that she fired her lawyer for suggesting she sign a prenup. When the couple divorced four years later, Arnold left with £30 million. Roseanne said, ‘My husband and I didn’t sign a prenuptial agreement. We signed a mutual suicide pact.’

Jennifer Lopez didn’t have one for her nine-month marriage in 2001 to choreographer Cris Judd. She ended up giving him £10 million.

Mel Gibson’s divorce could be the most expensive in Hollywood history. He has been separated from his wife Robyn for three years after 28 years of marriage. When they married in 1980 it was before he hit the big time — and she is entitled to half his estimated £640 million fortune
