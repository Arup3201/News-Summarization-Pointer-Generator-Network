Bebe, the former £7.4million Manchester United forward, has been sent on loan to Cordoba in Spain after failing to impress new club Benfica.

Last season, playing for Pacos Ferreira on loan from United, Bebe scored 14 league goals in the Liga Sagres. 

That helped United finally get rid of the the 24-year-old as he signed for Benfica on a four-year contract for a £2m fee with a 50 per cent sell-on clause.

However, having barely featured for Benfica since his move, Bebe has now agreed a loan move to La Liga side Cordoba who are currently third bottom of La Liga.

The forward managed only four appearances at the Portuguese giants this season before the winter break - three of those as a substitute.

Bebe featured seven times for United during his four years at Old Trafford, scoring once.
