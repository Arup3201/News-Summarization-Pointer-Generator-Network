A flesh-eating drug that is popular in Russia and more deadly than heroin has reached St. Louis, with doctors confirming a case in the American Journal of Medicine.

Doctors at St Mary's Heath Center have come forward with the story of a patient they treated in December 2012.

The 30-year-old man's finger had rotted, turned black and fallen off.

He also had severe ulcers across both thighs.

The drug addict told doctors that eight months earlier he started using a substance called Krokodil - the Russian name for crocodile - that got its name from turning users skin green and scaly.

America's first known case of Krokodil: Doctors in St Louis have written an article for the American Journal of Medicine about treating a man in December 2012 who said he had been using the drug for eight months. One of his fingers had fallen off and he had severe open sores on his thighs (pictured) which is Krokodil's leading sympton

The 30-year-old drug addict arrived here, at the SSM St. Mary's Heath Center in Richmond, St. Louis, for assistance. If left untreated he would have contracted gangrene and died

According to STL Today the man said he had turned to the drug because he could no longer afford his $300-a-day heroin habit.

Desomorphine, the drug’s official name, is made by cooking prescription painkillers with contaminants such as gasoline, alcohol, paint thinner or lighter fluid.

The drug produces a high similar to heroin but is much cheaper to make and more addictive.

It has become a public health threat in Russia, where it originated, with an estimated 100,000 users.

The federal Drug Enforcement Administration has not confirmed any cases in the U.S. since two were reported in 2004 but did put out an information sheet in October for doctors and law enforcement officers to watch for potential signs of Krokodil abuse.

Dr. Dany Thekkemuriyil and Dr. Unnikrishnan Pillai treated the drug addict that was using Krokodil

Dr. Dany Thekkemuriyil and Dr. Unnikrishnan Pillai, who treated the St. Louis man, said they started researching the drug in order to warn the public.

They then a wrote an articale the respected American Journal of Medicine, which is expected to be released next month.

'Our case if the first to be published in a recognized medical journral,' Thekkemuriyil said.

'It eats people from the inside.

'It kills you from the inside.'

'We wanted people to be aware of this very deadly poisonous drug and we want people to stay away from this.'

There have been other reported case around the United States, including a poison control center in Pheonix and a hospital in Joliet, Illinois, but none were known as early as this case.

Other victim: The drug was first found in Russia where many- including blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, pictured- came forward after receiving treatment for the drug in Siberia after using it for seven years

In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year yet it is thought about a quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison.

Addiction is spreading among young people and even those who manage to quit come away disfigured for life.

Margarita Schelkunova, 28, and her husband became hooked on the drug seven years ago.

Even though Miss Schelkunova is now clean, she has lost her sight and has been diagnosed with cancer and HIV with only weeks to live.

However, one British doctor believes he may have came across a case in the UK. 

Dr Allan Harris, a GP in Gloucester, wrote in an article for The Independent that the man was homeless and in his 30s. 

'There was essentially a crater in his arm and you could see the bone and tendons,' he wrote.

'It is hugely addictive and potent and can be cooked up in 30 minutes. It's only a matter of time before we start seeing it in Britain. It is not a case of 'if' but 'when'. 

Norman Baker, minister for crime prevention, told The Sun: 'Desomorphine - krokodil - is controlled as a Class A drug in the UK because it is dangerous.

'We are determined to tackle the illicit drug trade which can have such a destructive impact on the lives of so many.'

Krokodil's medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing a raft of ingredients, including codeine and gasoline.

There are millions of users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.

The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name.

Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.

The high lasts for about an hour and a half and the drug can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin.
