As crowd-funding continues to grow in popularity, young people across the world are now using it to fund missionary trips to Australia to answer 'God's calling'.

Asking for amounts up to $15,000, these Christians are travelling Down Under on evangelical missions and are requesting people  pledge money on their GoFundMe pages to help them 'spread their message.

This comes just a week after a 20-year-old tried to raise money to throw her milestone 21st birthday, but her plight was met with fierce backlash on social media with people suggesting there were much more worth causes.

And while charities themselves are embracing crowd-funding as a new way to fundraise, organisations are warning people to be careful where they put their money.

Increasing numbers of people are using crowd-funding site GoFundMe to raise money so they can embark on evangelical missions

Asking for amounts of up to $15,000 these women say they have been 'called by God' and it's their mission to spread his word

Among a number of GoFundMe pages discovered by Daily Mail Australia, almost half of the owners have aspirations to attend the Hillsong Church in Sydney, where the widely-known establishment was founded. 

'Sydney, Australia is home to the world-wide known Hillsong Church. Within the campus of such a powerful movement stands a highly recognized college,' one woman, Illiana Nunez wrote on her fundraising page.

'Hillsong International Leadership College will be my new home come July of this year ... Every dollar counts, and each one will be a blessing. So pray for me, if you will, and see if God may tug on your heart to be a part of this with me,' she also wrote on her page.

From Clermont, Florida, the woman raised $3225 of her $5000 target.

Many users write on their pages they want to embark on evangelical missions or study at bible colleges

Another woman with an ambition to travel to the Hillsong College is Remington Mealey, who has asked for $10,000 to help cover the cost of living in Australia with the church for a year.

'I want to not only be able to learn how to study Gods word, how to apply it to my life but also learn how to lead others in living an encouraging and impactful life based on the word of God. 

'Out of all the bible colleges, my heart pounds for Australia,' Remington wrote. She asked for $10,000 to towards the trip, with $3178 of that already donated.

However Hillsong told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment on specific cases and do not dictate the way students choose to raise money to attend their college.

'Students come from around the world to attend Hillsong International Leadership College,' Hillsong said in a statement.

'We do not provide advice to students on how to fund their education and have never suggested that students use external websites.'

Others who had created fundraising pages online it was their calling to travel to Australia and spread the word of God, saying they had been chosen for evangelical missions.

'I never thought I would be heading into Ministry. It was unfathomable to me that God would want to use me until he made me realize that he IS preparing me ...God, now, is leaving it up to me to choose whether or not I want to take his tutelage or not,' Rayanna Tomlinson posted.

'God has inspired me to reach out and help others and this has been a dream of mine for a very long time, anything helps', Megan Machen wrote on her page.

While some of the pages date back a little way, it shows what seems to be an increasing trend where people can ask for funds to support any endeavor they may choose - and people will donate money.

Just last month 20-year-old Sydney woman Celestina Ramljak launched a crowd-funding project to keep her dreams of having a 21st birthday party alive.

After getting a rude shock when she put a deposit down at a venue, she launched the campaign when she realised she couldn't afford to fund it.

But the young woman faced serious backlash on social media as a result of the campaign. 

Crowd-funding sites like GoFundMe, Indiegogo, Pozible and Kickstarter are just some of many that allow people to raise money in a new way.

Despite the pages outlining what each person intends to put the profits towards, there is little more information available after the fact when it comes to using the funds.

Ultimately, crowd-funding pages like GoFundMe rely on the honesty and trust of strangers willing to pledge money to unknown people and causes.

Despite the pages outlining that each woman will be taking part in mission programs, studies and services, there is little more information available about the individual's intentions when it comes to using the funds 

Fundraising Institute Australia's CEO, Rob Edwards said while crowd-funding provided unique opportunities for money to be raised, he asked people to consider where their money was going.

'As with any fundraising channel, we encourage people to think carefully about their donation and where they feel it will have the most impact, Mr Edwards told Daily Mail Australia.

'Do your research - look for information about the crowd-funding organisation's mission, programs and goals. Do these match your donation preferences? 

Review what the crowd funding organisation has done (its output), what has it achieved (its outcomes) and what difference has it made (its impact),' he advised.

Mr Edwards also urged people not to be deterred and reminded them of the good they're doing by donating to causes.

'Charities rely on the trust of the Australian community to be able to operate and would cease to exist without it, so you can feel confident your donation is going to do good.' he said.
