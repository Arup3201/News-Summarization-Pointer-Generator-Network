Nasa has managed to get men on the moon, rovers on Mars and probes around Saturn's rings.

But it seems the space agency has yet to master how to make an appetising cheeseburger in space.

Astronaut Terry Virts' recently tweeted a photo of a strange-looking 'space cheeseburger' wrapped in a tortilla.

'Beef patties, Russian mustard, tomato paste, cheese paste and tortilla. VERY TASTY!' Baltimore-born astronaut, Terry Virts, wrote alongside his tweet

While it may look disgusting to us, this 'space cheese burger' is the pinnacle of cosmic cuisine.

The first man in space Yuri Gagarin ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the Earth in 1961.

When Americans followed the Russians into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the Project Mercury missions.

However astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate.

By the time of the Gemini missions from 1965-6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding.

Astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off.

Foods are either partially or completely dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling.

Imagine the scene: you've just embarked on your mission to Mars and, for your first meal of a several-months long journey, you've got a rather unappetising plate of beetle larvae.

This, rather unappealingly, is a scenario Chinese scientists say could be the future of space exploration.

They claim mealworms are high in protein and are ideal for long space trips, and to prove it they shut three volunteers away for 105 days and placed them on a diet of just larvae and plants.

The volunteers, one man and two women, lived inside an enclosed biosphere at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

According to the South China Morning Post, the idea has been met with criticism in the West where critics say, despite the high protein content, having to eat mealworms would lower morale in astronauts owing to their unappealing look and taste.

Meats are exposed to radiation before they are put on-board the shuttle to give them a longer shelf life.

During Thanksgiving, while most Americans roasted turkeys and emptied cranberry sauce out of cans, Virts and the ISS crew broke out the scissors to open bags of freeze-dried, irradiated and thermostabilised food.

Their menu included traditional holiday fare with a space-food flair - irradiated smoked turkey, thermostabilised candied yams and freeze-dried green beans and mushrooms.

The meal also featured Nasa's own freeze-dried cornbread dressing - just add water. Dessert featured thermostabilised cherry-blueberry cobbler. 

Food on the ISS today, although still not able to match that enjoyed on Earth, has improved greatly from the early days of spaceflight in the 1960s. Where once astronauts were limited to tubes of pasted food, now they at least have foods that you would find back on Earth (shown)
