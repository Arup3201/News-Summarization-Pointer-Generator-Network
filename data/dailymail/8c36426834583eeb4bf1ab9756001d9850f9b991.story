David Cameron’s former university college has been hit by an outbreak of mumps, it has emerged.

Students at Brasenose College in Oxford started to fall ill with the virus last week, just as summer exams began.

This afternoon, the University has said 17 students at the college - where Prime Minster David Cameron studied - have been affected.

A university nurse confirmed the outbreak
 by sending a message to all undergraduates warning about the highly 
infectious virus - which causes painfully inflamed glands and swelling.

In some cases, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if it moves into the outer layer of the brain.

It can be especially dangerous for men - as it can cause swelling of the testicles which can affect fertility.

Despite the outbreak, the Junior College Room still held a boozy ‘bop’ - a party at the hall for around 100 students on Saturday.

College entertainment officer Liam Langley sent an email to all the students reminding them about the party.

His email was sent just two days after College Nurse Kate Tempest warned students about the mumps outbreak.

Mr Langley’s email said: ‘Hey everyone. Just a reminder that despite the mumps situation the arts week bop will still be taking place tonight [Saturday].

‘The theme is literary characters and as usual proceedings will start dtb [down the bar] before moving over to the new Babylove, the castle tavern, at around 11.

‘It promises to be a great end to arts week and I hope to see you all there!’

One third-year English student, who asked not to be named, described the outbreak as a ‘crisis’.

They said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous.

‘We got an email from the college nurse telling everyone to be wary of mumps and then two days later we had a massive party.

‘This place is like a ghost town - so many people have either gone home because they don’t want to get sick, or are lying in bed ill.

‘This is exam season - these are the most important exams of my life, so I really don’t want to get ill.

‘It’s so irresponsible for the JCR not to cancel the bop on Saturday night.

‘I didn’t go but I know quite a few people that went and have now come down with mumps.

‘There are about 200 people at the college and I reckon at least 30 are already ill.

‘It’s a crisis - if any final year students get ill now, they may have to wait a year to take their final exams.

‘I don’t want to have to do that - we should have a quarantine, rather than more parties.’

Cases of mumps have also been confirmed at St Hilda’s and Corpus Christi colleges, both in Oxford.

In an email to Corpus students, the welfare dean Judith Maltby wrote: ‘It has been brought to our attention that there are several cases of mumps within the University and there have been two confirmed cases within Corpus.

‘If it is confirmed that you have the virus you will be encouraged to go home (where possible) for five days.’

Oxford University said today: 'There have been 17 cases of mumps reported at Brasenose College, Oxford, over the last five days and all students are being cared for at home or in the College.

'The College is working with the college nurse and doctors and taking advice from Health Protection Agency to ensure that the best advice and information is provided to students, including the signs and symptoms to look out for.

'The College is advising any students who suspect they might have mumps-like symptoms to stay in their room and phone the college nurse or GP for advice.'

They refused to comment on about the party organised by the JCR mumps-hit Brasenose College.

The Prime Minister is just one of many 
famous former Brasenose students who also include Monty Python comedian 
Michael Palin and Olympic rower Andrew Lindsay.

 Mumps, as well as measles and rubella,
 is vaccinated against using the MMR jab. A full course of the MMR 
vaccine requires two jabs.

The
 vaccine was first introduced in the UK in 1988 as a single injection 
for children under the age of one - with the necessity for a second 
injection only becoming apparent eight years later in 1996.

The second jab is administered between the ages of three and five.

Taking this in to account, this means some of the older students at the college are at a heightened risk of getting mumps.

In
 1998, a paper claiming there was a link between the vaccine and autism 
was published by Dr Andrew Wakefield.

A
 great number of parents therefore decided their children should not 
receive the vaccine. Their children would be around the age of 16 now.

According to statistics released by the Health Protection Agency, the percentage of MMR uptake in the UK fell from 88.3 per cent in 1998 to a low of 79.9 per cent in 2003.

Andrew
 Wakefield's work has since been completely discredited, however. He has
 been struck off the register as a medical professional in the UK in 2010.

Studies since have not found any such link between the vaccine and autism or bowel disease.
