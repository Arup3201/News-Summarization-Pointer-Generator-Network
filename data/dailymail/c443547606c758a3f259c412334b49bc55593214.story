Tom Cleverley has joined Aston Villa on loan after the Premier League rubber-stamped their last-ditch bid to sign the Manchester United midfielder for the rest of the season.

Villa requested a two-hour extension to get the deal done shortly before Monday's 11pm deadline, and then filed the paperwork 15 minutes after the 1am cut-off point.

However, after considering their case on Tuesday, the Premier League has approved the loan and given the green light for Cleverley to move to Villa Park.

A statement read: 'The Premier League Board is satisfied that an agreement between Manchester United and Aston Villa for the season-long loan of Tom Cleverley had been made prior to the 11:00pm deadline. Therefore the temporary transfer has been approved.' 

It completes a frantic 24 hours for the 25-year-old England international who looked set to join Villain a permanent £7.5million deal on deadline day when United accepted their offer and he headed to the Midlands for a medical.

However, Everton attempted to hijack the transfer when chairman Bill Kenwright opened talks with United chief Ed Woodward but saw his bid of £5.5m flatly refused.

Cleverley, who was forced to train with the reserves last week, was in danger of being left in limbo before Villa boss Paul Lambert revived the deal just before the deadline.

The player dashed to United's Carrington training ground and signed the necessary papers which were then sent straight to Premier League headquarters.

Confirmation: Aston Villa tweeted Cleverley's arrival the day after the transfer window closed

That was then: Cleverley was a regular under previous boss David Moyes but not under Louis van Gaal

International: Cleverley will hope this move will help him secure his place in the England side
