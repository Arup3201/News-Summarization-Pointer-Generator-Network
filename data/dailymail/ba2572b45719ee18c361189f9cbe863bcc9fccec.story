Shoppers were sent into a frenzy after fearing a 'gunman' had opened fire during a Black Friday brawl as bargain-hunters continued to cause chaos.

Fights continued to break out across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year - depsite some stores saying it has been 'quieter than usual'.  

Customers in the Westfield Annapolis Mall in Maryland panicked after hearing loud bangs and windows smashing - fearing someone had started shooting.

According to WJLA there was a fight in the food court that saw tables overturned. Anne Arundel County Police responded and the mall was put on shut down.

However the mall reopened a short time later, allowing shoppers to continue their hunt for cut-price gifts.  

Elsewhere desperate shoppers were seen fighting over the last toy in a Fischer Price while others scrapped over barbie dolls and widescreen TVs.

In Great Bend, Kansas, a group of grown men held onto the final Power Wheel in the toy store in a bid to take it home.

A video shows one woman told one of the men to let the box go before a security guard intervened - saying none of those tugging at the item were allowed to buy it.

In Unicoi, Tennessee, a crowd were huddled round a bin of barbie dolls passing them back to friends and family members behind them.

A video obtained by WJHL shows the deal hunters shouting as they push others aside to grab the figurines. 

Police in Central Valley, New York, also arrested a father who allegedly left his young children alone inside a hotel so that his wife could finish her Black Friday shopping.

Toru Sakaguchi was placed in custody after his four-year-old son was seen walking around the hallways of the Hampton Inn in Central Valley at around 4am on Friday.

According to ABC 7, the child told police where his room was and when they opened the door, there was an 11-year-old handicapped girl inside.  

Sakaguchi told police that he left his children alone at around 3 a.m. so that he could pick up his wife from the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, but he had to wait over an hour for her to be done shopping.

A security guard eventually intervenes and tells the group that none of them can purchase the toy

According to NBC New York, two people were slashed with box cutters in separate incidents in suburban stores.

A Costco employee in Nanuet, Rockland County, stabbed another with a box cutter shortly before the store opened for business Friday while an 18-year-old was targeted outside the Tanger Outlet Mall in Riverhead, on Long Island. 

As many as 96 million shoppers were expected to hit the streets on Friday, but mall crowds were relatively thin and workers reported fewer shoppers - in a sign that the mad rush is happening the night of Thanksgiving and more consumers are picking up deals online.

'We've been really slow now,' Janelle Martin, a mall worker in St Petersburg, Florida, told WTSP on Friday. 'I don't feel like it's Black Friday…because Black Friday is when you shop. It doesn't count when you come in on Thanksgiving at 6 o'clock.'

Most major retailers now open their doors Thursday evening and offer extended holiday deals rather than limiting them to one day. The result is a quieter experience on what has traditionally been the busiest, and sometimes most chaotic, shopping day of the year.
