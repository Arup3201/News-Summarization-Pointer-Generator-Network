The Duchess of Cambridge's millionaire parents are at the centre of a property row following accusations they've received special treatment over plans to improve their mansion.

Michael and Carole Middleton have submitted plans to improve their Berkshire country home through an application which can normally be viewed by any member of the public.

But neighbours have claimed the Duchess's parents are receiving 'special treatment', as the plans to build an extension, annexe and covered parking have been hidden from public view by West Berkshire Council.

Neighbours of Carole and Michael Middleton have complained that the local council 'hiding' their planning application is 'unfair'

Those wishing to see the plans in person have to submit a written request and gain 'acceptance' of their ID from the local authority.

Normally any member of the public can view planning applications on council websites or in person by visiting council offices.

But West Berkshire Council said today the plans cannot be viewed for 'security reasons and a request made on behalf of the family', and have given no explanation how to provide acceptable ID.

Kate and her sister Pippa grew up at the mansion in the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire, where their parents still live.

Michael and Carole Middleton were today accused of getting special treatment, however, as planning application laws which apply to all other members of the public have not been applied to them.

The refusal by West Berkshire Council will be even more frustrating for Bucklebury residents given that just two months ago a local authority gave the public access to security plans for Kensington Palace.

Despite the local authority being asked to keep the documents secret, anyone can request access to see security plans for the Palace in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to move in to next year.

One neighbour of the Middletons, who 
did not wish to be named, said: 'There are other people in the village 
who’ve put in planning applications for house extensions and they 
haven’t received this special treatment. It’s just not fair.'

Another
Bucklebury villager added: 'They’re no better than lots of other people
round here so why should they think they can lord it over everyone like
this?'

The application is a sharp contrast to
two other Bucklebury families who’ve submitted plans in the last month 
and who weren’t even given the option to ask for their details to be 
kept hidden.

The council 
said the decision to shield the Middleton plans was taken by planning 
managers, implying it did not go before elected members of the authority
where the principle of whether it’s the right thing to do could have 
been debated.

Council 
spokesman Keith Ulyatt denied the public were being denied a chance to 
view the plans, but admitted the 'sensitive nature' of the application 
was the reason.

He said 'We haven’t taken it off show. It was never on show on the website. It hasn’t been concealed.

'There
are instances of other planning applications where plans have been 
withheld. As a planning authority we are not unique in this.'

Howver
he conceded that even plans concerning AWE, the top-secret atomic 
weapons base at Aldermaston, near Newbury, do not always get the same 
level of protection as the Middletons’ scheme.

'Many applications from AWE do not, in fact, include details for security reasons. Even on copies of plans presented to us, there are sometimes details held back by them for security reasons' he said.

The council says a chart will be kept showing who presented an 'acceptable' written request and ID and was allowed to look at the Middleton plans at the council offices in Market Street, Newbury.

The chart will be 'kept under lock and key' at the council offices until the application is decided, at which point the chart will be placed on the public file.

Mr Ulyatt added 'Dealing with the plans in the way we have, we know how many people have viewed the plans. This supports the security stance, yet leaves the process open.'

The council is expected to make a decision on the application before April 6th.

With their daughter marrying a Prince, the Middletons have been thrust into the limelight and have been accused of cashing in on their new-found fame to build up their business interests and wealth.

It’s the second row to rock West Berkshire council in a fortnight - earlier this month campaigners including author Richards Adams criticised the authority for nodding through plans to bulldoze beautiful Watership Down to make way for 2,000 new houses.

Opponents say it paves the way for the partnership behind the plans to pocket a £70 million jackpot for the 100-acre site.
