The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a 'well-heeled' stockbroker has apologised to his latest victim after being jailed for helping him pull of the scam.

Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims.

However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis.

Sorry: Heyworth, pictured here before her sentencing, met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money

The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived 
with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a 
'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride.

He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash.

Heyworth then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money. Now she has joined Travis behind bars after a judge said she must have known what the 'pathological liar' was really like.

Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity

Travis is already serving eight years in jail after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an 82-year-old man out of £100,000.

Outside court before she was jailed, Heyworth
said: 'I would just like to apologise to her. If I get any money in the
future, I would give her some. I hope he would do the same. He tells me
his family has money and, if that's the case, he should give her some.'

She
claimed Travis, who lived with her in their council flat for 18 years, was 
'manipulative' and she no longer wanted him in her life. But it is the 
third time she has made the claim after being involved in his string of 
scams.

In 2004, Heyworth 
claimed she was left £15,000 in debt by unemployed Travis, after telling
her he was an Italian viscount called Franco Dibella III.

She
later claimed he had wormed his way back into her life and, when Travis
was jailed last year for fleecing the elderly man, she claimed she felt
‘sickened'.

Manchester's
Minshull Street Crown Court heard she helped her lover commit his 
latest lonely-hearts fraud between July and November 2011. The pair, of 
Middleton, near Rochdale, both pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.

Lisa
Boocock, prosecuting, said Travis told the lonely-hearts victim he was 
called Mohammed Kashif Rai when he met her on the Muslim Singles 
website.

Reality: Scott Ravis and Gail Heyworth were actually living together in this council flat in Heywood, Rochdale

He claimed he owned
property in Hale Barns and Pakistan, but later claimed he had become 
the victim of fraudsters and needed money to pay for car insurance and 
religious clothing.

Travis 
asked the victim to drop off some of the cash at his council flat, but 
claimed he could not be there because he was suffering from cancer.

He also arranged for the victim to hand money to Heyworth at two meetings at the Trafford Centre and in Cheetham Hill.

woman out of nearly £12,000

Other money was deposited in a bank account before the victim became suspicious and contacted the police.

Miss Boocock said: 'The victim felt that they would marry. Everything he said was very convincing.'

The victim said in a statement read out in court: 'He has betrayed me and broken my heart. He's ruined my confidence.'

Travis did not appear in the dock. He had refused to leave his cell at the jail in Wolverhampton, where he is being held.

Patrick
Buckley, defending Travis, said he had refused to engage with his 
solicitors. Shirlie Duckworth, defending Heyworth, said the extent to 
which she was taken in by him was ‘very hard to quantify'.

The
court heard a psychiatric report on Heyworth found no evidence of 
mental illness, but she had previously suffered from stress.

Judge
Mushtaq Khokhar jailed Heyworth for eight months. He also jailed Travis
for 18 months, which will be added on to the eight-year sentence he is 
already serving. He said the victim was a vulnerable woman who had been 
humiliated.

He said: 'He is a pathologically-born liar in every sense of the word. Even when he was caught, he persisted in that.'

Sentencing
Heyworth, he added: 'It may be that he told her lies, but she lived 
with him a number of years and she would have known what he was like.

'There is no way of her being manipulated like she says. She accepts that she knew this money was being obtained.'
