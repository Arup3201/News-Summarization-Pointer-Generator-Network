Sales of powerful kettles and toasters are rocketing amid fears they will be next on an EU high-wattage hit-list.

The appliance website ao.com said sales rose 58 per cent in a week because of worries the kitchen goods will also be outlawed in favour of low energy alternatives.

Brussels chiefs have already banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts as part of efforts to cut household energy use.

Sales of toasters and kettles have risen after the EU announced a clampdown on high-energy home appliances in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Swan Pyramid Kettle (left) and 4-Slice Toaster are among those being snapped up 

It is part of a wider strategy to dramatically cut energy use in the home in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by having fewer power stations. 

Leanne Beswick of appliance website ao.com said kettles and toasters were ‘flying out of the door’ because of uncertainty over which appliances will be next.

Sales of powerful models rose by 58 per cent in the last week. 

'We’ve seen a significant increase in sales across some of the smaller appliances rumoured to be under review by the EU’s Ecodesign directive banning high-wattage appliances because of their energy usage levels.

Vacuums of more than 1,600 watts will be banned, including the 1,900 watt Hoover Smart Pets Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner (pictured) 

‘The EU has as set targets to reduce energy consumption by 30 per cent by 2030 and it appears that smaller appliances have been earmarked as part of that drive.

‘However at this stage we don’t know which appliances and which power levels will be affected. 

'As a result of this uncertainty we have seen kettles and toasters have been flying out of the door.’

Popular products include the Swan 4-Slice Toaster, Swan Pyramid Kettle, Bosch 2-Slice Toaster and Bosch Styline Kettle. 

UKIP has blamed the sales rush on the EU, with deputy leader Paul Nuttall attacking ‘nannying Eurocrats’ for interfering in family life.

The MEP for the North West said: ‘The lunatics running the asylum are now contemplating banning high wattage household devices such as hair dryers, kettles and smartphones.

‘Not content with the ridiculous prohibition on vacuum cleaners the Brussels bureaucrats have their eyes set on about 30 other electrical items.’

The UK government has given its backing to the EU plans to promote energy efficient appliances in the home.

German Gunther Oettinger, the EU’s energy commissioner said: ‘All EU countries agree energy efficiency is the most effective method to reduce energy consumption and dependence on imports and to improve the climate.

‘Therefore there needs to be mandatory consumption limits for small electrical appliances.’
