Support for Scottish independence is crumbling as the referendum approaches, a new poll revealed yesterday.

The YouGov poll for the Times found that just 35 per cent of Scots would vote ‘Yes’ in a referendum tomorrow, with 54 per cent saying they would vote ‘No’.

Just 11 per cent said they were still undecided or would not vote. 

First Minister Alex Salmond has staked his future on Scotland voting yes for independence 

The findings are a major blow to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond, who has staked his credibility on achieving a close result in the September 18 independence referendum.

The poll suggests that concerns about Scotland’s economic prospects are uppermost in the minds of voters.

Just 27 per cent believe the country would be better off economically on its own, while 49 per cent believed it would be worse off and 11 per cent said there would be no difference.

Meanwhile, just 17 per cent said they would be personally financially better off under independence, compared to a substantial 43 per cent who said they would be worse off, and 23 per cent believed it would make no difference.

Blair McDougall, campaign director for the pro-union Better Together, said: ‘This poll is a major setback to Alex Salmond’s negative and divisive campaign.

‘The more people think about the consequences of breaking up the UK for jobs, pensions and public services, the more they are saying no thanks to separation.’
