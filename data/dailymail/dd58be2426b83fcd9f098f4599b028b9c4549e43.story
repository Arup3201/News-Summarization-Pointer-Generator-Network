This is the hilarious moment a daredevil snowboarder wipes out while being dragged behind a car on a snowy street - risking serious injury or arrest.

The man, named Anton, zipped past parked cars while performing the dangerous stunt after a blizzard in Voronezh in Western Russia.

Things didn’t go smoothly, however, as Anton wound up falling on his rear end as he carved through inches of fresh snow while clutching a rope attached to the car.

The snowboarder convinced his friends to pull him behind a car in the early hours to avoid police

This video shows the adrenaline junkie travelling at high speed as he weaves back and forth on the street, narrowly avoiding a collision.

He dodges parked cars and is passed by vehicles speeding along the street after nightfall.

And as he leans to his left he suddenly falls to the ground.

After the stunt Anton said snowboarding along city streets is harder than boarding down a mountain

He suffers a hard landing on his rear end and his head snaps back toward the ground as his friends in the car stop to check on him.

Anton said he convinced a friend to tow him around as if he was water-skiing, making sure to head out in the early hours to avoid traffic and police.

The extreme sports fan said snowboarding along city streets is harder than boarding down a mountain.
