A schoolgirl has spoken of her 14-hour police cell ordeal after being accused of a bomb hoax that was allegedly made by a teaching assistant.

Holly Littlefield says she was called 'Holly Bin Laden' when she returned to school two days after the lengthy questioning by police officers who suspected she had emailed in a bomb hoax.

Zoe Gregory, a teaching assistant at Holly's school, has now been suspended amid claims she sent the threatening message to a teacher using Holly's email account.

Holly, 16, said staff at Ormiston Victory Academy, in Norwich, phoned her mother to tell her that staff would be picking her up and taking her to school after an email was sent to a member of staff.

Speaking of the moment she was met at the gates by two police officers, the traumatised pupil said: 'All they would tell me was that an email had been sent but they couldn't say any more. I assumed maybe a teacher had been called a name or something.

'When I got there the police asked me if I knew why they were here. I said no but that's when they told me a bomb hoax had been sent.

'They said they needed to take me to the station and that I should be in and out within two hours.'

Holly was taken down to the station, where she spent most of the day locked up in the cells - and her mother Lesley, 43, did not know she had been arrested until five hours later.

By then officers had a warrant to search her home and had seized Holly's computer and mobile phone.

The schoolgirl said: 'I was horrible and I just kept crying. I thought I would be in there for half an hour and then interviewed.

'They had to move me to a different cell because there was a woman who was banging and screaming.

Holly was picked up from Ormiston Victory Academy, Norwich, by police officers after the email was sent from her account 

'It was terrifiying. I just wanted to go to sleep but I couldn't. They gave me food but I just felt a bit sick. 

'I have never been taken to a police station before and I've never even been in trouble before.

'It felt like I was being treated like a criminal. When they moved me from the cell one of the officers asked me if I regretted what I had done.

'I was close to saying I had done it just so they could let me go.'

Holly claims she was in the cells for 12 hours before being made to give DNA, fingerprints and a mugshot before her police interview.

She was interrogated for 45 minutes before being released from custody on bail 14 hours after her arrest.

Holly says she was called 'Holly Bin Laden' when she returned to school two days after the lengthy questioning by officers

The teenager stayed off school for the next two days but when she returned she said she was bullied by classmates.

Holly said: 'When I went back to school I had children running up to me saying "have you got a bomb" and others were calling me "terrorist" and "Holly Bin Laden".'

Nearly three weeks after spending the day in the cells she was contacted by officers at Norfolk Police to say there would be no further action against her. 

Holly's mother Lesley said: 'When I first received the call in the morning she [Holly] looked completely bewildered.

'I know when my children are lying and I could tell she didn't have a clue what was going on.

'They let me speak to her at 3pm when they had finished searching the house and she was just sobbing.

'It was absolutely heart-breaking. When she came back she was still in quite a state. She has had nightmares about all this.

'People were saying to her sister at school that she had been arrested for drug dealing and that she had been arrested for assaulting someone.

'Now we are at the stage where we are having to write a letter to get all her details removed off the police database. Its awful.'

The mother-of-two also claimed that the school had contacted her to say Mrs Gregory had resigned.

A spokesman for Victory Academy said: 'The safety and well-being of students is always our number one priority.

'When the threat was made we contacted the police and followed their advice to the letter. Since then we have been co-operating fully with their investigations into this matter.

'As soon as the member of staff in question was arrested we suspended them, ahead of a full disciplinary process.

'We have been liaising closely with the families of the children originally involved and we're doing everything we can to support them.

'Whilst we are relieved that the threat was a hoax, we will not tolerate any action which disrupts the education of children at our school.'
