Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has been stripped of his two Australian honours.

The decision was gazetted by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove on Monday.

'It is notified that the Governor-General has terminated the appointments of Officer and Member of the Order of Australia in the General Division made to Mr Rolf Harris,' the notice from Mark Fraser, the Secretary of the Order of Australia, said.

The news coming amid revelations that the convicted paedophile could be earning as much as $2500 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments.

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986.  

But while fellow inmates at his Category C Stafford prison earn no more than $12 a day performing chores, the disgraced 84-year-old is making a fortune. 

‘He is a convicted paedophile and yet he is ­making a large sum of money,’ a source close to his finances told the Sunday People.

‘All he has to do is sit in his cell and his fortune grows.’

Harris invested much of his multi-million dollar earnings from his long-running career as a TV star, musician and artist.

At the time of his sentencing, his companies were worth almost $20million, the Sunday People reported.

New figures suggest his earnings have shot by more than $500,000, according to the newspaper.

Harris also owns a home on the River Thames and his total assets could be worth more than $30million.

He also earns interest on $4.6million in cash and the stock-market value of $12.4million of shares owned by his firms continues to rise.

Harris is one of many celebrities jailed for historic sex crimes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Former glam rock singer Gary Glitter was found guilty of carrying out a string of sex attacks on young girls while at the height of his fame.

He was found guilty of of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. 

Rolf Harris removal from the Australian gongs list was made official by the Secretary of the Order of Australia, Mark Fraser, on Monday.
