A fire in the boiler room of a cruise ship carrying nearly 3,000 people prompted the vessel to return to port in Seattle, officials said.

Holland America said that there were no injuries among the passengers and crew of the Westerdam from Saturday's blaze.

'A small fire in one of the boiler rooms' that occurred after the vessel set sail was quickly extinguished, the company said.

Public Relations Vice President Sally Andrews said that after the fire, the Coast Guard inspected the 82,348-ton ship and cleared it to sail again, which could occur before dawn.

'We anticipate it will be before the morning,' she told The Associated Press.

The Seattle Times reported that the flames broke out around 5pm as the vessel was in Puget Sound near Kingston, according to Coast Guard petty officer George Degener. The crew knocked the fire down, but a while later it restarted.

A combination of high-pressure mist and crew members with hoses extinguished the fire, Kyle Moore, spokesman for the Seattle Fire Department, told the paper.

The city dispatched a fireboat, and a few units to the Pier 91 cruise terminal, as a precaution.

Holland America brought the ship back 'out of an abundance of caution and in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard,' a company statement said.

No evacuations were needed, firefighters reported.

The Westerdam was beginning a seven-day Alaska cruise with 2,086 passengers and 798 crew members onboard when the blaze occurred.

Cruisefever.net reported passengers will receive $250 per stateroom in onboard credit and a 25 per cent certificate for a future cruise equal to the cruise fare that they paid.Â 

The news comes after a Holland America cruise ship worker was arrested in Florida in February after admitting that he raped and beat an American passenger during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her overboard.

Ketut Pujayasa, a 28-year-old room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam, claimed he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted him when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day.

The Indonesian told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed.

The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape.
