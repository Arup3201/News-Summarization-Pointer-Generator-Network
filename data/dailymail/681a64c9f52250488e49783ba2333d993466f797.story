A femme fatale who divided a Czech community by sleeping with Nazi soldiers to give them STDs has had a plaque erected in her memory.

Locals in the south Bohemian town of Trebon said the nurse, who worked in a local hospital, decided to get revenge on the Nazi invaders after she was raped shortly after the occupation in 1938.

Former lawyer Karel Friml, 79, now lives in the woman's house and is behind the move to have her memory recognised.

He said: 'Unfortunately, we don't know her exact name because time and memories have failed to preserve it.

'But we know that she was assigned to look after wounded German soldiers and began affairs with them.'

At first the mystery nurse was shunned and branded a whore by locals, but when the soldiers began either disappearing or dying, Mr Friml says it became known that she was deliberately infecting them.

'This was her resistance and vengeance for the rape of her country and her personal rape,' he said. 'She had many German lovers, maybe six, maybe ten, maybe more.

'People say that all of them disappeared after the affair with her.'

German troops rolled into Trebon right at the start of the Second World War, after the Nazis had already annexed various partly German-speaking regions of what was then Czechoslovakia - known as the Sudetenland - a year earlier.

By proclamation of Adolf Hitler, the entire western half of the country - the Czech side - was renamed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

While their government continued its formal existence, the Czechs' Nazi rulers quickly set about mobilising the population for labour to aid the German war effort.

The Gestapo meanwhile set about dismantling the Czech intelligentsia and middle class according to a plan to eventually eradicate the Czech national identity through assimilation and deportation.

It was the Gestapo who eventually got to Trebon's mystery nurse, after they sent an agent to find out what was happening to their soldiers in the town.

Mr Friml said: 'The Gestapo noticed that these people were disappearing and sent a secret agent to the hospital,

'He uncovered what she was up to and had her shot.'

Regional historian and curator of the museum in Trebon Jirina Psikova said: 'The woman is historically unrecognised with no known documents mentioning her, but several people remember her story and opinion is divided.

'Some say she was a slut and spread sexually transmitted diseases among German officers; others say she was a real patriot who was raped and infected by the Nazis and she decided to get her revenge.'

But Mr Friml is clear what he thinks. 'I am really sorry that she died anonymously, I think she was a hero.

'And that's why we have made this memorial plaque to her and placed it on the wall of the house.'
