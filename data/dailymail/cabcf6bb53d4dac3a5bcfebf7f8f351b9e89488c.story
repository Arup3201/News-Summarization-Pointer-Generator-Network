A year ago Jacqueline Sparks was healthy, pregnant and looking forward to becoming a mother for the first time.

Now she is a 27-year-old going through menopause and feeling ashamed that she can never give her husband the large family they both desperately wanted.

Ms Sparks lost her daughter Mia and her ability to ever have a family naturally when a drug-affected driver crashed into the car she was travelling in with her two brothers.

'What makes it worse is I have this guilt that I'm holding [my husband] back from having a family, because he'd make such a wonderful dad, but it's not my fault,' Ms Sparks told Daily Mail Australia.

Jacqueline Sparks lost her unborn baby and her ability to have children in a horrific car accident 

On September 30 last year she was travelling in the front passenger's seat of her brother's car on the Princes Highway at Dapto in Wollongong, NSW, when Marco Paulo Silvestri crashed head-on into the vehicle as he tried to overtake another car.

Ms Sparks was air-lifted to Liverpool Hospital following the incident where doctors discovered the extent of her injuries: head trauma, broken ribs, fractured ulna, lacerations to the bone, punctured lungs, lost vision and the 'loss of her 32 week foetus'.

The car crash was so severe her womb catastrophically ruptured upon impact and had to be removed.

In local court earlier this year, Silvestri pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the Illawarra Mercury reported.

In a hearing in the district court in Sutherland on Wednesday, a victim impact statement read out on behalf of Ms Sparks described the pain she felt when she realised she had lost her daughter Mia.

'I do not remember understanding nor being told what had happened but I do remember a single tear falling from my face onto the perfect little nose of my lifeless daughter in my arms,' she wrote.

'I have lost my daughter, my womanhood and my chance to ever become a mother naturally.'

Ms Sparks, from Farmborough Heights in southwest Wollongong, feels angry at Silvestri for taking those things away.

'As remorseful as he did seem yesterday, everyone's remorseful after the act,' she said.

'If you get caught doing something you feel sorry.

'How many times before that had he driven on drugs?'

Ms Sparks also feels upset that he was charged with dangerous driving and not manslaughter.

'It's frustrating with driving charges, it's seen as an accident it's not seen as a crime, but the car's a weapon as well,' she said.

Ms Sparks hopes to see a bill known as Zoe's Law passed through NSW Parliament, which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more.

The bill is named after Brodie Donegan's unborn daughter Zoe, who died at 32 weeks when she was hit by a drug-affected driver in 2009.

Ms Sparks said her husband Chi Nguyen was devastated by the accident as the couple were looking forward to raising a large family together

But due to the accident Ms Sparks can no longer naturally give birth to children, and is already going through menopause at just 27

In November 2013 the bill passed through the NSW Legislative Assembly 63 votes to 23, but it has yet to be introduced to the NSW Upper House.

The controversial bill has faced strong opposition over concerns about the implications it would have for women seeking abortions.

Ms Sparks just hopes to prevent other women from suffering in the way that she has.

'I know [Silvestri] won't be charged for manslaughter now but if it does happen again I think it's an important thing to realise it was a child,' she said.

'I just think a baby should be recognised as a baby and that person should be charged with something more.'

Ms Sparks said the crash has devastated her husband Chi Nguyen.

'We both come from a big family - I come from four and he's from ten – and we both want a big family,' she said.

'If we do have to go into commercial surrogacy we're going to need literally $1 million to have four children.'

And even if they choose to pursue surrogacy, they will face a number of obstacles including finding a surrogate and confirming that Ms Sparks can still produce eggs.

The crash had a major impact on Ms Sparks' family, pictured here are her brother Tim (left) who was driving the car, sister Jo, brother Jonathan who was a passenger, and her mum (right)

'I'm 27 and I'm going through menopause, it's ridiculous,' she said.

'Plus all these issues around Thailand surrogacy, surrogacy in NSW is illegal and for us to even have that option we'd have to consider overseas.'

Ms Sparks said the crash has also affected her social life, especially at an age where many friends are getting married and having children.

'People don't really know how to be around you, they wonder if they should give their baby to you to hold or is that insensitive,' she said.

'Some of my best friends have recently had babies and I avoid it, I feel like I'm putting an awkwardness on them.'

Her brothers Jonathan Sparks, 25, and Tim McNamara, 29, have also been severely affected by the crash.

Mr Sparks' spine was crushed and he will never again be able to bend over or lift more than 15kg, which has had a major impact on his career as a chef.

Ms Sparks also revealed the impact the loss of her only daughter had on her own life, and the difficultly she faces while her friends are all having children of their own

Mr McNamara feels guilty as he was the one driving the car.

'I know he's really depressed, he hasn't found work,' Ms Sparks said.

'Being the driver you have guilt like you could have swerved differently or braked sooner, even though it's not his fault at all.'

On Tuesday this week, exactly one year after the crash, Ms Sparks and Mr Nguyen bought Mia a birthday cake and reflected on what life would have been like if she was there with them.

In court on Wednesday, defence lawyer Bill Whitby read out apology to Ms Sparks and her brothers on behalf of Silvestri. He was remanded in custody until Judge Paul Conlon hands down his sentence on October 22.

But Ms Sparks finds the apology difficult to accept.

'Your actions have completely changed my life. I feel like a different person - mentally and physically. My happiness, my career, my self-esteem, my social interaction, my sleep, my energy, my laughter and above all, our daughter, is now gone,' she wrote in her victim impact statement.

'You chose to take drugs and you chose to drive dangerously. This is our life now and you gave us no choice.'
