A baseball fan is getting steamrolled online after he was caught on national television lifting weights while watching a ballgame.

The unidentified man was captured by an MLB camera in the middle of a set of curls during the seventh inning of Saturday's New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles game.

Announcers laughed hysterically as the man is seen fiercely pumping iron from a Hilton Baltimore hotel window that overlooks Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

Beast mode: This fan was caught on national television pumping iron while watching the Yankees and Orioles game in Baltimore

An employee for the nearby Hilton Baltimore says the man was probably at the hotel's fourth-floor fitness center, which has a view of the Oriole Park at Camden Yards

The Internet quickly caught on.

'Gotta get that pump,' wrote one social media commenter.

'What a beast,' said another.

A third added: 'That's weak s**t.'

A Hilton employee told TheBlaze that the hotel has a fitness center with a fourth-floor view of the ballpark.

'Itâ€™s a selling point of the hotel,' the employee told the website.
