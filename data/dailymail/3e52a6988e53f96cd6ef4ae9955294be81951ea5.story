What a waste!: Justin Timberlake's popular Italian restaurant Destino's closed because of faulty sewage that caused human waste to leak from the walls twice, alleges a lawsuit filed on Tuesday 

'On any given night the dining room swelled with a mix of executives, neighborhood regulars and celebrities, all enjoying the superb food and drink,' Destino’s lawyer says in the case against Amguard Insurance Co.

'The Destino restaurant not only served great food, but had wonderful atmosphere,' said the filing.

The restaurant was headed former Rao chef Mario Curko and was a celebrity hot spot in the heart of midtown Manhattan.

The suit claims that in July 2013 illegal plumbing pipes burst above the restaurant which in turn caused human waste to leak down the walls forcing the bustling  restaurant to close.

The lawsuit alleges that the insurance company pushed the restaurant to reopen in November 2013 when it wasn't yet ready.

The suit says that a few days after the restaurant reopened a pipe fell on a stocked food area which spewed a mold infestation.

The insurer denied Destino’s claims including a $275,000 bill for repair and company losses.

It was previously known that the restaurant flooded but Tuesday's lawsuit revealed that the restaurant was soiled with sewage, a detail that may have been left out in case they ever decided to reopen for business. 

Timberlake along with his partners still own a restaurant in New York City called Southern Hospitality located in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen area. 

Hot spot: Destino in the heart of Manhattan's midtown neighborhood was popular among celebrities 

Stick to singing: While Justin Timberlake's restaurant was quickly flushed away his solo career and his stint as the singer of the popular boy band N'Sync made an imprint in American pop culture
