A bride-to-be has organised the wedding of her dreams in just 10 days after her seriously ill husband proposed to her.

Cancer sufferer Chris Clark, 41, proposed to his girlfriend Charlotte within minutes of finding out his condition was incurable.

With the help of family and friends, it took just 10 days to organise the wedding they had dreamed about.

Last October Charlotte organised a last minute wedding to terminally-ill boyfriend Chris Clark. He proposed within minutes of being diagnosed with incurable stomach cancer

Charlotte, 30, had made an online scrapbook of her dream wedding months before Chris's illness, which helped her with a speedy wedding turnaround.

Chris was told he may only have months to live by medics at Warwick Hospital last September after being diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer that had spread.

He had started suffering pains in his
side while on holiday which grew in intensity, and was also feeling 
tired and had lost his appetite.

After a series of tests, Chris, a photographer, was diagnosed with secondary cancer in July 2012.

Charlotte and Chris were married in October October 2012 at St Gregory's Church in Offchurch, Warwickshire. Before getting married she had already made a scrapbook of her perfect wedding

Charlotte said that their engagement was always going to happen, it was only a question of when. After his proposal, Chris broached the idea of a quick register office ceremony, but Charlotte wanted to have her dream rural church wedding

The
couple, from Offchurch near Leamington, Warwickshire, found out it was incurable in September.

Chris, 41, said: 'I already knew I wanted to be married to Charlotte so when they said it was non-curable I knew what I was going to do.

'When I was told the news it was like an explosion, I felt deaf and a bit disorientated. I just got up and walked out as they said I've got to have more tests.'

Chris
and Charlotte were sitting in a hospital waiting room five minutes 
later, in a state of shock, when he turned to her and popped the 
question.

Then just minutes after, he was in a hospital bed undergoing another round of gruelling tests.

Charlotte said the big day was the wedding she had always dreamed of. The couple had been together for six years before they wed but always knew they would eventually tie the knot

Family and friends were informed of his prognosis before the couple told them their good news.

'Our
engagement was always going to happen, it was only a question of when,'
added Charlotte, a social worker who met Chris six years ago at a 
wedding.

After his proposal, Chris broached the idea of having a quick register office ceremony.

But
it was not quite what she was hoping for, because for the six months 
before Chris became ill Charlotte had been planning her dream of a rural
church wedding.

Friends, family and local businesses rallied round to make the couple's magical wedding come true. Despite having a week's notice to be at the event, some 300 people shared the couple's big day at a neighbouring farm

She had compiled an online scrapbook 
with her wedding wish-list, detailing everything she wanted from the 
venue and who would be bridesmaids to the design of her wedding dress.

Charlotte says, 'The whole day was just like the wedding I had dreamed of. We have been together for six years, and have always known we would get married, but had been taking our time.

'Even
though Chris hadn't asked me yet I would save links and pictures in a 
folder on my tablet that I would want in my future wedding.

Chris - a freelance photographer who once served in the Navy - suffers with is a hereditary form of cancer but he didn't know about his risk because he was adopted. He was given just six months to live but is still alive, eight months after the wedding

'When we decided to do a wedding in ten days the preparation I had done was a Godsend, and made things lots easier.

'We were lucky as loads of family and friends have businesses that are involved in weddings in someway.

'Chris's
brother has a marquee business, we have a friend who is a photographer 
and another who is a florist. The wedding more or less planned itself!'

'The whole day was just how I had dreamed.'

Charlotte said they count their blessings every day. She said: 'We keep thinking it could be ten times worse. Chris is feeling pretty good at the moment so we're making the most of that. He's my inspiration'

Generous friends, family and local 
businesses rallied round to make her magical wedding come true in just 
10 days, and the pair said 'I do' in a church ceremony at St Gregory's 
Church in Offchurch, Warwickshire, on October 6th 2012.

The couple were surrounded by 100 family and friends including 
Chris's children Connor, 20, Logan, 17, and Sennen, 15, from a previous 
marriage.

Despite having a week's notice to be 
at the event, some 300 people shared the couple's big day in October at a
neighbouring farm.

Charlotte said: 'It was amazing. It was everything I wanted and more.'

Charlotte, a social worker, met Chris seven years ago at a wedding

On June 30 Charlotte will join more than 4,000 women taking part in the Race for Life to help raise more than £400,000 for Cancer Research UK's life-saving research projects

After their wedding, Chris - a freelance photographer who once served in the Navy - started seven bouts of chemotherapy.

The rare cancer he suffers from is a hereditary and he did not know about the risk because he was adopted.

However,
he has already defied the statistics as doctors said the average life 
expectancy from the point of diagnosis was six months.

Despite his ongoing treatment Chris is accompanying Charlotte on training runs. He also plans to be the first to cheer her past the finish line when she completes the 10km Race for Life

Charlotte said:'We are all hoping 
and praying the cancer hasn't grown. We're trying to live a normal life 
and we are very pragmatic about the future.

'We count our blessings every day. We keep thinking it could be ten times worse. Chris is feeling pretty good at the moment so we're making the most of that. He's my inspiration.'

On June 30, Charlotte will join more 
than 4,000 women taking part in Race for Life 5km or 10km courses to 
raise more than £400,000 for Cancer Research UK's life-saving research 
projects.

Chris said: 'I'm incredibly proud of Charlotte for what she's doing because she could so easily sit back because she's so busy with work and worrying about me. It shows the woman that she is to me'
