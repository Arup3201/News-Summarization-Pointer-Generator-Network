Research from community website 
work.shop.play found residents in different boroughs across the 
capital tend to share certain habits and traits based on their 
postcode, pictured. The site surveyed 6,000 members on topics from tech to politics to plot boroughs based on hobbies and interest

Meanwhile, Lambeth’s neighbours in Wandsworth, as well as residents in Ealing, are big fans of professional site LinkedIn.

If you’re looking for tech advice, residents in Lewisham will be the most helpful as they were found to be the most computer-savvy in the city.

And for legal advice, head to Harrow for the largest proportion of legal professionals.

In fact, north London on the whole, including Enfield and Barnet, has the most educated and well-read residents.

Work.shop.play calls itself an ‘urban
 online community’ and its members earn rewards by answering survey

Simon Harrington, Marketing Director, Exterion Media UK said: ‘We all have a tendency to think of London as this huge, sprawling urban expanse, but we sometimes forget that our capital is actually a conglomeration of small villages and micro-communities, all of which have their own unique identities and personalities.’
