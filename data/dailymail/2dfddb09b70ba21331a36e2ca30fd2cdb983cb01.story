Couple: Paul and Sandra Dunham were due to leave their home in Northampton this morning for London

A British couple facing extradition to
 America in a row over expenses are feared to have attempted suicide 
just hours before they were due to be handed over to US marshalls.

Paul
 and Sandra Dunham were last night being treated on separate hospital 
wards for a suspected overdose as police stood guard outside.

The
 couple, both 58, had previously warned they would rather take their own
 lives than face the prospect of dying in a US jail.

Now their 
supporters fear that the moment they are ruled fit to travel, they will 
be handed over to American officials by British police.

They were due to hand themselves in ahead of a flight to America at a London police station at 10am yesterday.

But police were called when they failed to answer the door to early morning visitors to their home in Northampton.

Officers
 who forced their way in with a battering ram at 7am found Mr and Mrs 
Dunham upstairs at their £600,000 four-bedroom detached house.

Mr
 Dunham was helped to walk from the property to an ambulance. Mrs 
Dunham, who was pale but conscious, was taken to another ambulance on a 
stretcher.

Mr Dunham’s father Fred drove 20 miles to visit the couple 
from his home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. He said his son ‘wasn’t
 really  with it’ and declined to comment further.

The
 case has chilling echoes of the case of Asperger’s sufferer Gary 
McKinnon, who doctors warned might take his own life if attempts were 
made to bundle him on a plane to the US for computer hacking.

Mr McKinnon was saved by Home Secretary Theresa May after a lengthy Daily Mail campaign.

Last
 night his mother Janis Sharp told the Mail: ‘Will our politicians wait 
until someone dies before they change this horrendous extradition treaty
 that appears to be being abused by the US?’

Despite
 pleas from the Dunhams’ lawyer for a 14-day stay, the Home Office was 
last night insisting there was nothing it could do, and any fresh appeal
 must be lodged with the courts. The couple have already exhausted the 
normal appeal process.

The 
case has provoked outrage over the use the Extradition Act to haul the 
couple across the Atlantic for trial for what their supporters say 
amounts to a civil dispute. 

Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming 
expenses when he was chief executive of US company PACE and his wife of 
aiding and abetting her husband.

They insist his were ‘wholly 
legitimate’ business expenses signed off by a senior director at the 
company.

Mrs Sharp added: 
‘The Dunhams have been charged with exaggerating their expenses.

'Extradition should only be used for those who have committed heinous 
crimes, such as terrorism, not this sort of thing.

'These people are 
being dragged from their own country before any evidence has been heard.
 The fact that this seems to have driven the Dunhams to attempt to take 
their own lives shows that extradition can be worse than death.’

Isabella
 Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said: ‘The Dunhams’ ordeal is a 
terrible indictment of our dangerously unfair extradition laws.

Politicians who talked reform but repeatedly failed to deliver – and in 
fact made things worse – should think hard about their actions today.’ 

Mr
 Dunham ran the UK arm of the American soldering iron manufacturer, and 
his wife worked in sales at the company. After more than 25 years’ 
service they were asked to move to the US in 2005.

William
 Siegel, the owner of PACE, promoted Mr Dunham to chief executive after 
removing his son Eric from the company. The couple say he agreed the 
firm would pay their relocation costs.

But
 in May 2009, after Mr Siegel brought his son back into the business, 
the couple resigned due to disagreements with him and returned to the 
UK. Eric Siegel now claims that between 2002 and 2009 the couple 
embezzled more than $1million (£600,000) in company expense claims.

Defeated: The pair lost a High Court battle last month against extradition to Maryland to stand trial over charges relating to 58-year-old Mr Dunham's company, Pace

In
 December 2011 Mr Dunham was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money 
laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland.

He could face a 
maximum jail sentence of 340 years. His wife was indicted on eight 
counts of fraud with a possible sentence of 240 years.

Last night a close friend of the Dunhams visited them in hospital and said their condition was ‘greatly improved’.

Dorian
 Smellie, 42, said he had been told they had been ‘tipped over the edge’
 after their MP, Tory Andrea Leadsom, who had been lobbying on their 
behalf, told them that the Home Secretary was unable to halt the 
extradition.

He added: ‘Paul
 and Sandra were in their bedroom and were in a bad way. They could not 
tell the paramedics what they had taken, but I think it was quite clear 
to the ambulance crew what had happened.’
