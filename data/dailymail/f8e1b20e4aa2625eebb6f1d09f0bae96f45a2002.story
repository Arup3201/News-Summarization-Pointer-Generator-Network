With its A-list approval, high price tag, long list of apparent benefits and rather bizarre formula, it sounds like the recipe for a miracle product.

But critics have questioned whether Gwyneth Paltrow’s favourite face cream has one key ingredient – the evidence to back it all up.

Experts claim that the £50-a-bottle Restorsea – which contains brown algae and an enzyme from salmon eggs – is no more effective than an everyday moisturiser.

Criticism: Claims made in advertisements for Restorsea, backed by 41-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured, have been called into question by Harley Street medics who said the sample size of 40 was too small

Endorsed: Miss Paltrow said she would never give her name to a cream which she didn't use herself

And they condemned the decision to sign up Miss Paltrow to promote the cream as shameless marketing.

In a new advertisement, the actress, 41, is quoted as saying: ‘I love how it smells, that it works, the story and that fact that it is a brand started by a woman entrepreneur. I never promote anything that I don’t use, love and believe in.’

Praise: Miss Paltrow said she liked that the cream was founded by a female entrepreneur

The brand, meanwhile, claims its key ingredient, the ‘Vibransea’ salmon egg enzyme, exfoliates and adds protein while giving the same benefits as anti-ageing products such as glycolic acid and Retin-A.

But dermatologists in London’s Harley Street were less enthusiastic, claiming the product has not undergone rigorous clinical tests, the sample size of 40 used to test it was too small and there was little evidence that it worked.

Bruno Ballardin, from the London Skin and Hair Clinic, said: ‘In order to truly support the benefits of skincare products, manufacturers need to test the formulation on enough subjects to be statistically significant, i.e. hundreds.’

And skin expert Louise Thomas-Minns, from Uandyourskin.co.uk, said: ‘I think once again we are being seduced by a so-called “miracle product” that happens to have a great celebrity endorsement.’

But Restorsea yesterday insisted their products have undergone rigorous third party clinical testing on women between 35 and 60.

A spokesman said: ‘Clinicians saw statistically significant improvement to the skin after two, six and 12 weeks.’
