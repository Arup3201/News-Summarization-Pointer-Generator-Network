Les Dennis recalls his friendship with his comedy partner Dustin Gee

As a young comedian playing the working men's clubs in the 70s, I'd been in awe of Dustin Gee. One night at a club in Hull I saw a poster saying, 'For one night onlyâ€¦ Dustin Gee!' He hadn't done much TV, but he was a big draw on the club circuit.

In the early 80s I landed a job on Russ Abbott's Madhouse. Dustin was already working on the show and I'll never forget him walking through the door, all 6ft of him, announcing, 'I come bearing gifts!' even if it was only a bottle of warm Blue Nun wine to welcome me.

My then manager, who also looked after Dustin, suggested I move into his flat in London and help with the rent.

We became as close as brothers, and 
after we formed a double act I was catapulted to fame. Sharing a flat 
with Dustin - famous for his Basil Fawlty impression - was a scream.

We worked well together too, and a BBC big cheese said he'd like to give us a show of our own, The Laughter Show.

I
 learnt a huge amount from Dustin, who was about ten years older than 
me. His attention to detail when it came to doing impressions was 
extraordinary -  I remember watching him putting a wig on a block and 
dressing it to look like Rod Stewart's hair - and I've still got all his
 props in my loft at home.

Then he was diagnosed with the heart muscle disease cardiomyopathy in 1985.

We were topping the bill at the North Pier in Blackpool and we got to the interval when Dustin said, 'I don't feel well.'

A
 doctor examined him and found he'd had a mild heart attack. But he 
insisted on finishing the show, then he was whisked to hospital.

Les and Dustin lived together in a flat in London where Les said they became 'as close as brothers'

We carried on working together once he'd
 recovered and were in panto in Southport when he had a massive heart 
attack on New Year's Day 1986. He spent a couple of days in a coma then 
died, aged 43.

I was devastated by Dustin's loss, and love to think we would have carried on working together. But however things had panned out had he lived, I know that we would have remained mates, because we always made each other laugh.
