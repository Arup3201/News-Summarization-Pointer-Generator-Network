This is the shocking moment a thug launched into a sickening attack on a mother and daughter in a city centre bar.

The 52 year-old victim said she felt lucky to be alive after being punched so hard by Garth Ward, 20, that he broke her cheekbone.

Ward was in a group of eight men who walked into Lammars bar in Manchester's Northern Quarter, where the victims were on a night out.

The shocking attack on the mother and daughter by Garth Ward in Manchester was caught on CCTV

Shortly before 2am a scuffle broke out between the two groups, resulting in a drink being thrown into the face of a 19-year-old woman.

Her mother went to protect her daughter and dry her face, telling the men to ‘back off’.

It was then that Ward launched into the attack, punching the mother in the face and knocking over her daughter with the same blow.

He then punched the mother again and kicked her to the body before he was dragged away.

Her white dress was left covered in her own blood and as he was escorted away by door staff, he spat at another woman.

The mother, who asked not to be identified, has suffered lasting nerve damage and has had to give up work because of her injuries.

She said: ‘The attack has changed my personality and lifestyle completely.

‘I am angry that he would hit a female of my petite size with so much force. I feel lucky that I wasn’t killed.’

Ward pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH) at an earlier hearing following the incident on September 29, 2013.

Ward, of Middleton, Manchester, was today sentenced to 12 months behind bars by a judge at Manchester Crown Court.

Police are continuing to appeal for information as to the whereabouts of Garth Ward’s father, also called Garth, who is wanted in connection with the incident and is believed to be abroad.

Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw said: ‘Ward’s cowardly behaviour caused public outrage at the time when a press appeal was launched in a bid to identify the person responsible from CCTV.

‘We received numerous calls identifying Ward (junior) which we were able to swiftly act upon.

‘This shows that the community who know him are not prepared to put up with his thuggish behaviour.’
