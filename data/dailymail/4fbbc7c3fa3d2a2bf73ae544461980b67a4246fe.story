The Queen will today grant a posthumous pardon for wartime codebreaker Alan Turing, who was convicted in the 1950s for homosexual activity.

The pardon is only the fourth since the Second World War to be granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.

It was requested by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who described Turing as a national hero who fell foul of the law because of his sexuality.

Pardoned: Almost 60 years after he killed himself with cyanide, gay Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing will be given a Royal pardon for the conviction which destroyed his life. Homosexual acts were only legalised in 1967

Mathematical genius: Mr Turing was seen as the father of modern computing and artifical intelligence

A life destroyed: Alan Turing with friends in his youth. He was 41 when he poisoned himself with cyanide

Ordinary house, extraordinary deeds: Hut 8 Naval Inteligence, where Alan Turing worked to crack German codes at Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes. There has been a long-running campaign to clear his name

Codebreaker: The machine designed by Alan Turing which cracked the German Enigma code, thereby stripping the German U-boats which were blockading Britain of their cover during the Second World War

Icon: The codebreaker was previously honoured with a statue in Manchester's gay village, left, and a cover of the gay magazine Attitude, right. Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said all those convicted should be pardoned

During the Second World War, the mathematician was pivotal in cracking the German Enigma codes, which gave Allied leaders vital information about the movement and intentions of Hitler’s forces.

Historians credit the work of Turing and his fellow codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years, saving countless lives.

Turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.

But in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity, which was illegal at the time. To avoid prison, Turing agreed to ‘chemical castration’ – hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido.

In 1954, aged 41, he died of cyanide poisoning. An inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, although his mother and others maintained that his death was accidental.

As well as physical and emotional damage, his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for GCHQ, the successor to the Government Code and Cypher School, based at Bletchley Park.

Speaking today, Baroness Trumpington - who worked with Turing at Bletchley Park - praised her former colleague, saying we could have lost the war had it not been for his work.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I really am very pleased [about the pardon].We knew the work he was doing at Bletchley Park was great.

'Without him, we could have lost the war. Our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots.

'We could have lost the war through starvation. That's how bad it was.'

Legendary: Mr Turing's story was dramatised several times, including in the 1986 play Breaking the Code, which played at London's Theatre Royal. Alan Turing, right, was played by Sir Derek Jacobi

Drama: Turing will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the forthcoming drama The Imitation Game, which also features Kiera Knightley. The pair were spotted filming in London's King's Cross station in October

More recently Turing was depicted by Ed Stoppard in the Channel 4 drama Britain's Greatest Codebreaker

Rare: There have only been three Royal pardons since the end of the Second World War

Turing is being granted a pardon after
 a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation. Pardons are usually 
given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event, but 
government sources said Turing was being pardoned because he was ‘a 
truly exceptional man who saved Britain’.

That
 means the decision to pardon Turing will not lead to pardons for the 
other 50,000 men convicted of similar homosexual offences.

Mr Grayling told the Mail: ‘In a list of Britain’s war heroes, the names of people like Churchill, Montgomery, Barnes Wallis, stand proud. Alan Turing’s name should sit with them. And yet after the war, far from being feted as a hero, he finished his life in disgrace. He was hauled before the courts and humiliated. His crime was that he was gay.

‘I have always regarded it as one of the great blights on our country’s history that a man who did so much for all of us should have been treated in such a terrible way.

‘And I am proud that the Queen has agreed to my request that he should be granted a full posthumous pardon, and that his memory should now have no stain upon it.

‘Alan Turing is one of the key reasons why Britain remained a free country. It is right that we should remember and celebrate his memory free from the taint of injustice.’ The campaign to pardon Turing was backed by MPs from all parties and by scientists such as the physicist Stephen Hawking. An  e-petition calling for a pardon received 37,404 signatures.

In 2009 the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon.

Yesterday Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘Alan Turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country.

‘His action saved countless lives. He also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements, often being referred to as the father of modern computing.’

Tory MP Iain Stewart, who represents Milton Keynes South, home of Bletchley Park, said he was ‘over the moon that justice has prevailed’.

Rare: Only three people have received Royal pardons since 1945: Timothy Evans, executed for the murder of his wife in 1950; Derek Bentley, hanged despite being 'feeble-minded'; and Michael Shields, right

Derek Bentley's grave, left, proclaimed that he was a 'victim of British justice'. Timothy Evans was only pardoned after it emerged serial killer John Christie, right, had murdered his wife. By then he had been hanged

He said: ‘Alan Turing made a huge impact on the world he lived in and left a legacy for the world of today and tomorrow. This royal pardon is a just reward for a man who was stripped of his honour, his work, and the loyalty he showed his nation.’

But gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘Singling out Turing just because he is famous is wrong.

‘An apology and pardon is due to another 50,000-plus men who were also convicted of consenting, victimless homosexual relationships during the 20th century.’

On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. A post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning.

An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June.

Several scholars, and even his family, have suggested Turing's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy.

When his body was discovered, an apple laid half-eaten next to his bed. It was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does. Some more peculiar theories suggest Turing was 'obsessed' with fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story.

The theory was supported in an article in The Guardian written by Turing's friend, the author Alan Garner, in 2011.

However, later evidence suggested that Turing habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. His mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental, cause by her son's storage of chemicals in his home.

Speaking on the 100th anniversary of Alan Turing's birth on 23rd June 2012, Professor of Philosophy Jack Copeland, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954.

He said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death.

He added that Turing's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself.

He pointer out that his friend Robin Gandy stayed with Turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy Turing seemed

Finally, the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that Turing could even have been murdered. Although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him Mr Copeland said his work at Bletchly Park was under strict secrecy until well after his death.
