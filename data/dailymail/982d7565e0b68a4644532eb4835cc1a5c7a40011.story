A young Texas woman is pleading with a drug company to make life-saving drugs available earlier to try to save her mother's life.

Chen Zhang has started a Change petition to call on pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly to release its new treatment Ramucirumab as soon as possible.

After three years of treatment for gastric cancer, Miss Zhang says the drug company's latest medication is the last hope for her mother, Yu 'Denise' Deng.

Mrs Deng, 52, has been through more then ten surgeries and several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment as she battles gastric cancer.

A new immunotherapy drug manufactured by Eli Lilly, and found to increase the likelihood of survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer is the only option left to the family.

But despite Ramucirumab being in the final stages of FDA approval, and having passed clinical trials, the drug is not likely to be available until spring 2014.

'I'm afraid my mom may not have that much time,' Miss Zhang said.

The Austin woman added that the past three years had been 'unimaginably difficult' but said: 'Throughout it all [my mother] has managed to maintain her spirit and beautiful warm smile.'

She has petitioned the company to offer it under an early use program, that would allow it to be released early to those in need.

However, she claimed on her Change page that a company representative told her that because it is due to approved in four to six months it has 'chosen not to provide the drug through a compassionate-use program at this time'.

'My mom isn't the only patient whose life
 depends on quick access to this drug. I know many more patients in 
Texas. Imagine how many more there are in the U.S. or the world,' Miss Zhang said.

Refusing take no for an answer, Miss Zhang has encouraged more than 24,800 people to back her petition so far, as she campaigns to get the drug released early.

'We are imploring Eli Lilly to adhere to
 their company purpose of SAVING LIVES and give my mom and hundreds of 
other desperate patients access to Ramucirumab now,' she said on Change.

The petition has received an overwhelming response, with medical professionals and former Eli Lilly employees joining the call for the company to hand over the drugs.
