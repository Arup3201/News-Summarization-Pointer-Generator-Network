Labour leader Ed Miliband has undergone an operation for a broken wrist.

A spokesman said he suffered the injury 10 days ago while hill walking in Devon with his wife, Justine.

However, it was only when he attended the accident and emergency unit at University College Hospital, in London, on Friday that an X-ray revealed he had suffered a fracture.

On doctor's advice, he returned to the hospital today for a minor operation to re-set the wrist.

He is now back home with his family and the injury will not affect his attendance at the funeral of Baroness Thatcher on Wednesday.

It is understood, however, that he required painkillers when he delivered his tribute to the former prime minister in the Commons last week.

Today he tweeted from his Twitter account: 'Thanks to all of the brilliant, friendly, dedicated staff today at University College Hospital who helped treat my broken wrist #lovetheNHS'

Sally Bercow has snubbed an invitation to Margaret Thatcher's funeral because she doesn't want to 'be a hypocrite and join in this attempted canonisation of her'.

The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow declined the invitation to Wednesday's service despite the wives of Ed Miliband, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown all being set to attend.
