A man has been fired from his job as a 'hospitality ambassador' in California after video surfaced that appeared to show him beating up a homeless man.

A male and female employee, dressed in neon shirts and baseball hats, began arguing with the two homeless men before the worker hit the man across the face behind a CVS store in Berkeley on March 20.  

The ambassador continued to attack while the homeless man was curled in a ball on the ground. Then, as the two men packed up their belongings to leave, he pinned the other against the wall by the throat.

The two 'hospitality ambassadors' confronted two homeless men in downtown Berkeley, California 

The 'ambassador' was caught on camera swinging a powerful punch which floor the homeless man 

As the man's dog leapt around in panic, the city worker continued to beat the homeless man while he lay on the ground in a ball 

Berkeley's ambassador program is coordinated through the Downtown Berkeley Association, a non-profit group.

Downtown Berkeley Association CEO John Caner apologized for the incident and said the man was fired on Thursday after a video of the beating was posted online.

He said a second 'hospitality ambassador' who witnessed the beating and did nothing to stop it has been suspended.

The names of both ambassadors have not been released. 

Mr Caner told Berkeleyside.com: 'It’s clearly totally unacceptable. We apologize to (the victim) and to the community. 

'This is clearly so out of the realm of acceptable behavior and totally contrary to all of the training provided to ambassadors.'

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the homeless man who was assaulted was later arrested by police on suspicion of assault and making criminal threats based on a report by the ambassadors.

The ambassadors' purpose is to create a more welcoming environment for residents and visitors. 

The two ambassadors hassled the homeless men until they gathered up their belongings and moved along

However the man could not resist taking one final swing at the vagrant - pinning him up against the wall
