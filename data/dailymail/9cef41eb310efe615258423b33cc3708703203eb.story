A 15-year-old girl who has fled Britain and flown out to join jihadis in Syria after being 'brainwashed' online may end up marrying an Islamic terrorist, a counter-extremist has warned.

Schoolgirl Yusra Hussien, described as a grade-A pupil who wanted to be a dentist, left her family home in Bristol to join hardline fighters in the war-torn country.

But a terror expert says she will most likely be told that she could best serve jihad by marrying an ISIS fighter. 

The devastating news emerged as Home Secretary Theresa May talked tough about the need to crack down on extremism.

Schoolgirl Yusra Hussien, described as a grade-A pupil who wanted to be a dentist, has left her family home in Bristol to join jihadis in Syria after being 'brainwashed' online

A spokesman for Yusra Hussien's family said they were 'very distraught' and feared she might be 'in danger'

Yusra, who is thought to have been exposed to jihadi propaganda on the internet, boarded a flight to Istanbul under the noses of police and border control officials at Heathrow.

She is believed to be with a 17-year-old girl from Lambeth, South London, whom she arranged to meet at the airport, and to have flown to Turkey in order to enter Syria, where Islamic State fighters control large areas.

Last night Yusra's distraught family, who are of Somali descent, begged her: 'Please come back. We miss you very much. You are not in any trouble. We just want you to be safe and to come home as soon as possible.'

Haras Rafiq, an outreach officer for the counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, warned Yusra may have gone to become a jihadi bride.

He said: 'We suspect what's happened is that she met up with somebody here in London, she travelled from Bristol to London, so she already had this romantic notion.

'She already probably believes that she's going to go and get married so one of two things will happen.

'It's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride. She at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior.

'Either she will have a role to play in the so-called Islamic State. In this case she's not a professional - she's not a doctor, she's not an engineer etc.

'It's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride. She at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior and that's how she will play a part in the jihad.' 

The teenager has not been seen since 7am last Wednesday when she left home in the Easton area of Bristol. Her parents thought she was going to school, but she is believed to have taken a coach to Heathrow.

Her father Mohammed, a youth worker, only realised she was missing when he went to collect her from school that afternoon. He and his wife Safiya, a dinner lady, declined to comment further other than to confirm their daughter was missing. A woman who said she was Yusra's aunt added: 'We are all really confused.'

A family friend said the teenager, who wears a headscarf, had not asked for any money and her parents were unaware of any cash she could have used to pay for her flight – suggesting that whoever recruited her may also have bought her tickets. 

Afzal Shah, who spent time with the family at their home yesterday, said they had noticed Yusra use her phone and computer a lot recently.

'The family have not been able to make contact with Yusra,' he said. 'The understanding I have is that the radicalisation is self-radicalisation as opposed to any institution. 

'There are so many forums and chatrooms on the internet that it's easy to be led astray. I don't know how she got to that stage but she was radicalised at that stage.

'It also begs the question how a 15-year-old child was allowed to board a flight like that.' 

Family spokesman Hibaq Jama said Yusra's parents were 'devastated - they have no idea where she is'

Mr Shah said police believe Yusra may already be in the east of Turkey near the border with Syria.

He added: 'IS is a menace to the whole of society and have nothing to do with the Muslim faith. They're violent and extortionist thugs. It's absolutely tragic. The family had no clue.' 

Anira Khokhar, speaking for the family, described Yusra as an 'intelligent, beautiful young lady. The family have lost a daughter and that is the most important thing here,' she said. 'They are just a family whose daughter is somewhere they are unaware of and she is in danger.'

Another source close to Yusra's family said they feared she had become brainwashed on the internet.

Up to 50 British girls and young women are feared to have gone to the Middle East to join the jihadis.

It is claimed that Yusra was introduced to the London-based radical – who is also from a Somalian family – by a third girl, who is now being sought in Bristol. 

Family home: A neighbour said the Hussiens were 'a very nice family - the father is always there for his kids'

Police were at Yusra's family home in Easton today as a family spokesman said they feared for her safety

Last night Avon and Somerset Police refused to explain how Yusra would have been able to fly without her parents to Turkey – a popular transit point for would-be jihadis - at a time of heightened security.

It was unclear which airline Yusra and the other girl flew on, and what rules it has in place for unaccompanied minors. Louisa Rolfe, assistant chief constable of Avon and Somerset, said: 'Since she was reported missing by her parents we've carried out extensive work to trace her footsteps from the time she left home to her arrival in Istanbul.

'There are indications she may have been radicalised but at the moment our priority is to find her before she crosses the border to Syria and make sure she is safe.'

She added: 'We must all be vigilant and ready to spot the signs of radicalisation. Often, young Muslims who go to Syria can be naive and don't recognise that they are being sucked into joining extremist groups.'

Many of the British women who have gone to join IS are believed to be based at the group's stronghold in Raqqa, eastern Syria.

Some are as young as 14 or 15, and travelling to marry jihadis, bear their children and join communities of militants. Twin sisters Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, left their Manchester home in July without their parents' knowledge to follow their brother to Syria. Both are reportedly now married to IS fighters.

Experts say a small number of the women are taking up arms.

Some British women and girls have posted pictures of themselves carrying AK-47s, grenades and in one case a severed head.

Yesterday two police officers were standing guard outside The City Academy, Bristol, where Yusra is a pupil.

Classmates say she is an A-grade student who has a very bright future and wants to be a dentist. A friend, 15, who had a history lesson with Yusra the day before she went missing, said she seemed 'completely normal'.

'I was sat next to her and she seemed fine,' she said. 'She didn't have any new friends that we knew about, and she was a completely normal girl.'

Abdi Omar, 26, who lives next to the family's six-bedroom Victorian terrace, said the family's plight had been mentioned at the local mosque, which serves a predominantly Somali congregation.
