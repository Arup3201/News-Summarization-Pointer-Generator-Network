Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh arriving at Croydon Crown Court in south London, where he is accused of multiple counts of voyeurism

A top doctor was unmasked yesterday as a depraved voyeur who secretly filmed more than 1,000 victims across the country.

NHS consultant Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh, 62, spent three years capturing patients, colleagues, friends and even children as young as three in intimate moments.

The world-renowned hearing specialist used tiny cameras hidden in lavatories to feed his obsession. He installed them at NHS and private hospitals across Britain, his offices, the bathrooms at his £750,000 detached home in Banstead, Surrey, and even trains as he travelled to appointments.

But Yeoh, who boasted to friends that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actress Michelle Yeoh was his half-sister, was caught red-handed when one of the devices fell off a toilet at a Surrey hospital and a colleague found it.

Police discovered Yeoh had inadvertently filmed himself installing it and searches of his offices and home revealed he had amassed a collection of footage. Investigators said it would take at least two years to examine the huge hoard of digital material on 17 computers, laptops, external hard-drives and memory sticks.

In a sinister twist, the doctor created compilations of his colleagues using the toilets and carefully labelled them with their names, actions and the date. He also edited together footage of him interviewing patients with intimate shots from the toilet, including in some cases images shot from multiple cameras. One of his closest colleagues was unwittingly filmed more than 300 times. Yesterday, the weeping father of three clutched a Bible and buried his head in his hands as he was warned he faces a ‘significant’ jail sentence. Prosecutor Peter Clement said: ‘This was a sophisticated, organised, planned and long-running campaign of voyeurism, the scale of which was vast.

‘It was beyond anything previously encountered by the Metropolitan Police. His voyeurism targeted colleagues, friends, patients and patients’ children, male and female. His intention was sinister, indecent and criminal.

‘He grossly abused the very high degree of trust placed in him as a consultant physician as well as a friend and colleague.’

Yeoh worked as a consultant vestibular physician, specialising in hearing complaints such as tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness, after coming to Britain from Malaysia aged 25. He rose through the ranks to become an honorary senior lecturer, expert High Court witness and director of two companies. His two daughters attend Cambridge University and the family were known to neighbours as respected professionals and devout Christians.

But his career came crashing down when a camera was found in a communal toilet at the privately run St Anthony’s Hospital, in Cheam, Surrey, on April 14.

When police confronted Yeoh, he said: ‘Will I go to jail? I was so stupid, don’t tell my family. It’s not serious – I can’t go to jail.’

Yeoh has admitted using a sophisticated network of cameras hidden in hospital toilets to spy on 1,000 patients including children at St Anthony's hospital

They found 23 covert cameras, which were disguised as computer memory sticks, pens and watches, including three hidden in hearing aid boxes in his car. A memory stick he was carrying on a lanyard around his neck when he was arrested carried a short film entitled: ‘Cardiff train teenager.’

Computer experts found that Yeoh had used the cameras to film at medical facilities including the private Portland Hospital, in Central London, St Helier Hospital and clinics in Exeter, Nottingham, Sutton, and Thames Ditton, Surrey.

Hours of footage was also captured on trains, including a girl, believed to be just three years old. Other victims included friends and colleagues who were invited to his home for social events.

Police were able to identify only 32 victims, many of them staff at St Anthony’s Hospital. There are at least a further 1,084 unknown victims. Yeoh gave detailed labels to the recordings, which included phrases such as ‘sweet young teen’ and ‘thin young blonde, Exeter’.

In mitigation, Yeoh’s barrister said he was an obsessive ‘collector’ who recorded so much material he was unable to view it all.

Yeoh admitted seven counts of voyeurism, six charges of making an indecent image of a child and one of possessing extreme pornography. He will be sentenced today.

Miss Yeoh, 52, who also starred in the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, has 15 half-brothers and sisters. Her spokesman was not available for comment yesterday.

The voyeurism charges relate to 30 identified victims and 1,084 unidentified victims, while the charge of making indecent images of children relates to six children

Colleagues of the voyeur doctor told of their horror yesterday at discovering he had been secretly filming them for years – and even giving some video clips a star rating system.

The three women, who worked at a top private hospital in Central London, said Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh’s actions had left them feeling ‘violated’.

They also told in excruciating detail how they had to watch Dr Yeoh’s videos to identify themselves. In them, he had edited together clips of them chatting to him at work with clips of them using the toilet.

The women were told in April that Dr Yeoh had been arrested but it was not until October that they found out they featured in his videos.

One victim, in her forties, said: ‘He would write a name then a brief description on each video. Some descriptions we didn’t understand because it was your name and then, for example, five stars next to it. Apparently that was how on show you were. It is so surreal and shocking, it is hard to actually believe it.’

Describing how she had to watch the videos with two policemen, she said: ‘I felt shocked, traumatised and then very sick.

‘I could not finish watching the video. I was not prepared for what I saw. I think there were 43 videos of me, in the office, on the toilet. When the police left I felt disgusted. I felt dirty. I was utterly disgusted. I wanted it to go away.’

Another victim, in her thirties, said: ‘You have lots of emotions – if you use public toilets, you look around a bit more.

‘You should feel comfortable doing that. I don’t work there any more but I don’t think I could return.’

The two women who have returned to work said they found it ‘very difficult’.

‘When we returned to work, we found the Blu-tack he had used to fix the cameras,’ said one. ‘Luckily the toilets where he filmed are being refurbished now.’

All three women described Dr Yeoh as ‘creepy’ and ‘socially awkward’.

The woman in her forties, who had worked with Dr Yeoh for 12 years, said: ‘I was absolutely convinced from the very beginning [that I was one of his victims] because of his very creepy behaviour. He would come into my office many times and would stay in the office on his own after I had left and I was thinking, “what is he doing on his own in the room for two minutes?” ’

The three women were among 19 of Dr Yeoh’s victims who were in court yesterday. One said: ‘It did help. He was in a vulnerable position – the roles were reversed.’
