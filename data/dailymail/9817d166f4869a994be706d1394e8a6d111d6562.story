Carol Kirkwood, pictured at the Television and Radio Industries Club awards where she was crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time, has been getting explicit pictures in the post

She has just been crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time – so there is no doubt Carol Kirkwood is a hit with viewers.

But the 52-year-old BBC Breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post.

‘I do get letters from older men, fan mail,’ she said, gesturing to her nether regions. ‘It is terrible. I have had so many over the years. I am almost immune to it. You can tell by the hand writing.

‘I don’t have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office. I don’t count them.’

Her smiley demeanour and shapely figure, which she often dresses in figure-hugging outfits, have attracted an army of admirers.

On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin and the BBC’s Tomasz Schafernaker.

Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter – who also does weather reports for The One Show – said she also receives sordid messages online.

‘You get a lot on social media. If they are on Twitter you block them,’ she said.

She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly ‘binned’.

The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride.

She said: ‘My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.’

The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups.

Last year she battled on despite accidently ‘clicking her clicker’ twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as ‘Town name’.

Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: ‘We can’t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn’t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.’

And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities.

‘People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,’ she revealed. ‘And also people’s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.’

She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession.

‘More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,’ she said.

And, although she thinks BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, 59, would not make the cut as a weather presenter, she believes multitasking men can be just as good at the job.

She revealed: ‘Bill Turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina. When you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time.

'If you can do it whether you are a man or a woman, then you can do it. We have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women. I don’t know if one is better than the other.’
