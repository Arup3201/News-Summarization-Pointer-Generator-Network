A ‘miracle baby’ has defied the odds to reach his second birthday despite being born with just a tiny amount of healthy brain.

Shelly Wall discovered three months into her pregnancy that baby Noah had a catalogue of health problems including spina bifida, rare chromosome abnormalities and hydrocephalus - fluid on the brain.

His condition was so serious that doctors warned Mrs Wall, 42, and husband Rob, 48, that he would not survive.

But despite the odds being stacked against them, the couple repeatedly refused a termination and two years on Noah is continuing to astound medical professionals.

Mrs Wall, from Abbeytown, Cumbria, said: ‘We wanted to give Noah a chance.

‘We are trying really hard to make day-to-day life as normal as we possibly can for him - we treat him just like any other child.

‘He is potty training now and he knows if he uses the potty then he gets chocolate.

‘It is amazing that he understands what it is and what he is supposed to do despite having only two per cent of his brain functioning.

‘He can also use a fork, spoon and a cup by himself. He knows a lot of different animals and will tell you to put the light on or off or to open the door.

Before he was born Noah's parents were advised to abort him because he has spina bifida as well as fluid on the brain and rare chromosomal abnormalities

Noah's mother says that he has just two per cent of the amount of normal brain tissue he should have. Image shows a scan of his brain - the dark area is all fluid and the grey area is the only normal brain tissue

‘He chooses things and makes decisions. He never shuts up and he can sing as well.

‘It is absolutely amazing. To look at him you wouldn’t know there was anything wrong.’

When Mrs Wall went for her 12-week scan doctors discovered that her unborn baby had spina bifida, a condition which affects the development of the spinal cord.

Doctors also told the couple that the condition had left a massive hole in Noah’s back which they said they would be unable to stitch up.

During the pregnancy, the couple were regularly offered a termination but they stood firm, adamant that their son deserved the chance to live.

But realising that the odds of survival were extremely low, the family began organising the unborn baby’s funeral.

But when Noah was born on March 6 in 2012, he took his first breath and began crying.

He was paralysed from the chest down - but he was alive. Doctors changed their mind and carried out a five-hour operation to stitch up Noah’s back.

Mrs Wall said: ‘The first thing we heard when he was born was him taking a breath and then crying, which was unbelievable.

‘We had been told that he wouldn’t be going down to the baby care unit because they were adamant that he wouldn’t take a breath and said it would be cruel to keep a baby alive on oxygen.’

Noah was allowed home after ten days but due to several emergencies had to return to hospital on many occasions.

The space left by the brain in Noah’s head is filled by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is drained regularly by a fitted shunt.

He passes this fluid out when he goes to the toilet.

The fluid became infected when Noah was seven weeks old and he had the shunt removed.

Two and a half litres of fluid was drained manually using a needle in his head.

The shunt was then replaced and the shape of Noah’s head is now closely monitored.

Despite having so little healthy brain tissue, Noah can say a few words and he is now potty training

Noah requires constant supervision, has to be massaged five times a day as well as undertaking regular sessions of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy.

As he only has a tiny part of his brain, his parents and sisters Steph, 21, and Ally, 17, are forced to live day to day knowing that it could be the last time they spend with him.

Mrs Wall said: ‘We don’t know how long he will live but we won’t put a time on him. We just take every day as it comes.

‘We spend a lot of quality time with him and he gets a lot of attention.

‘He is susceptible to fits but thankfully he hasn’t had any yet. He is also susceptible to meningitis.

Noah picked an Against All Odds Baby gong for bravery at the Big Heart Awards, organised by Mother & Baby magazine

‘He can’t regulate his own body temperature so we constantly have to take clothes off or put clothes on him.’

Research has shown that a lack of folic acid three months before pregnancy - not just during - can cause spinal bifida and Mrs Wall now spends her time raising awareness through Noah’s story.

She updated her Twitter on a daily basis throughout her pregnancy and has support from celebrities including Dragon’s Den star Theo Paphitis - who handed her one of his ‘Small Business Sunday’ awards for the shop she runs to raise money for Noah.

As well continuing to amaze doctors, Noah has now scooped a national award for bravery earlier this month.

The toddler picked up the Against All Odds Baby gong and rubbed shoulders with celebs including Jenny Frost and Imogen Thomas at the Big Heart Awards, organised by Mother & Baby magazine.

Mrs Wall said: ‘We are absolutely thrilled to bits. Noah ended up with lots of toys and goodie bags.

‘We were nominated by one of our followers on Twitter. I don’t know how many people were nominated but we got an email saying that Noah had won.

‘It is really nice to be nominated because you never expect anything. It’s wonderful. I’m still trying to take it all in.

‘The more awareness we can raise about his condition the better. We want to help as many people as possible.

‘We are watching Noah every day and you can never relax. It’s not nice but we have to make sure that he is OK. He is a happy baby and he is always smiling which is incredible.’
