A foster family who racked up a bill of more than £400 after buying their son a game on his tablet device for just £1.99 have hit out at Google for not having better protections on their apps.

Delivery driver Gary Hooper, 53, has been left to foot the hefty bill after his 10-year-old foster son unknowingly purchased 20 games worth £400 in just two days.

The nightmare started when Mr Hooper’s daughter Samantha bought an app via Google Play for her brother - who has learning difficulties - for just £1.99.

However, unknowingly, the app store on the Samsung device saved her bank details and the young boy managed to purchase the additional games and rack up extra charges – sometimes at a cost of up to £64 a session.

The family only realised what had happened when Samantha’s bank statement came through and showed she had been charged £409 by the Google App store.

Father-of-two Mr Hooper, of Bridgend, Wales, paid the money back to his daughter but said he is angry that he couldn't get in touch with Google to complain.

He said: ‘It was impossible to get hold of anyone.

‘There are barely any numbers online and when you do call the numbers, they refer you to websites.

‘I just wanted to request a refund because I couldn't believe how much money we had been charged for a cheap kids' game.

‘We would normally watch what he is doing on the tablet but that day he went upstairs to say he was watching a film.

Delivery driver Gary Hooper has hit out at Google for not having better protections on its apps and is hoping to get the charges refunded

‘He ended up paying out for lots of Google stuff, costing as much as £64 at a time.

‘He had no idea what he was doing - he is only 10 and has learning difficulties.’

Mr Hooper and his wife Geraldine first decided to start fostering after feeling lonely when their daughters moved out. They took in the boy six months ago to give him a better start in life.

Now the pair are hoping to get a full refund from Google for not having better protections on its apps.

Mr Hooper said: ‘I don't understand why they can't make it harder for kids to buy these things.

‘Anybody can do anything on these tablets. It's unbelievable.

‘I understand Google wants to make money but with the millions of pounds they are making it can do something about taking money from hard-working people like us.

‘By the time most people find out how much these things cost and what's happened, it's too late.’

However, when approached, a Google spokesman referred to its support website, which states: ‘We provide password protection on the our Store app to help prevent accidental or unwanted purchases on your device.’

Five-year-old Danny Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie

The Hooper family are not the first to have landed a huge bill for games and apps on tablet devices.

Last year, five-year-old Danny Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie.

Danny had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies.

His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home.

But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. He bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time.

His parents were refunded after they contacted Apple.

Another similar case was that of  eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry who used the family iPad to play The Simpsons game Tapped Out and often bought the virtual doughnuts on offer to help progress through the game.

However, he didn't realise that he was racking up an enormous £980 bill for his parents.

Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, only realised that their son had spent the huge amount after their bank account had been completely cleared.

They were refunded after contacting Apple representatives in America.

Cameron Crossan also ran up a £3,700 bill on his father’s credit card by playing games on his iPad.

Lee Neale, 43, faced a hefty bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing games on his iPad

Doug Crossan, 48, said he was horrified when his credit card company informed him of the amount his son had spent on the games in Apple’s online App Store.

The 13-year-old was mortified by what he had done and his father said he was unaware he was being charged for the purchases.

Lee Neale, 43, had his bank account frozen when his eight-year-old daughter Lily bought in-app extras while playing on a tablet using the password she had seen him entering when downloading items.

Lily ran up a bill of more than £2,000 in just six days and more than £4,000 over the course of five months topping up rewards and enhancements in 74 transactions.

Mr Neale claims the schoolgirl was unaware she was being charged 'real money' for the in-game purchases and asked to Apple to scrap the charge.

The father, from Peasedown St John, Somerset, allowed Lily to use his iPad so she could play numerous games including Campus Life, My Horse, Hay Day and Smurf’s Village.
