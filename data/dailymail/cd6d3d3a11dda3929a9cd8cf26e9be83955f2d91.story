A neo-Nazi dad who named his son Adolf Hitler has said he'll continue to have kids if child welfare services keep taking his - after another child, Eva Braun, was taken two days after she was born.

Heath Campbell, 40, a father-of-nine who first hit headlines after a bakery refused to ice his son's Nazi-inspired name on a birthday cake, has demanded welfare services hand back his daughter.

Campbell's fiance, 22-year-old Bethanie Zito, gave birth to the little girl in a Pennsylvania hospital on November 11 and the couple named her after Hitler's long-term companion.

After two days, the baby was taken into care by child services.

Demands: Heath Campbell, with his fiancee Stephanie Zito, said he will continue to have children if child welfare services continue to take his away. The couple's daughter was taken from them in November

Battle: The couple, pictured at their engagement in June, named their baby Eva Braun. The little girl was taken away 2 days after her birth - but Zito's lawyer said it was because her first child had been taken too

'I'm not allowed to have children because
 I’m a Nazi,' Campbell, from New Jersey, explained to the New York Daily News. 'That's what 
they're saying. Well, I'll stop making them when they stop taking them.'

Zito explained that she was getting ready to leave hospital when nurses took away the little girl and workers from the Franklin County Children and Youth Service announced they were taking her.

'I started screaming,' she said. 'I got hysterical. I had just been checked out. I was breast-feeding my
 daughter for two days straight. I changed her. I had clothes on her.'

Campbell, who lives off government assistance, had not yet seen his new daughter because he was miles away in New Jersey and had been unable to afford to travel to see her.

Namesake: The baby girl was named Eva Braun after Hitler's longterm girlfriend, pictured left and right

'They kidnapped her,' he said. 'Because I'm not going to mix with the 
opposite races and I'm not going to let my children mix, that gives them
 the right to steal my child?'

But Zito's lawyer said the couple's Nazi views were not the reason the child was taken. Instead, it was because Zito's first child, a son, had also previously been taken in to state custody.

A court hearing in the custody cases is scheduled for Monday.

Campbell, who has swastika tattoos across his body, including prominently on his neck, has frequented headlines since the birthday cake incident in 2008.

He has fathered nine children with five different women but doesn't have custody of any of them.

When he appeared in court earlier this year to fight for custody of his two-year-old son, Heinrich Hons, Campbell was photographed wearing a full Nazi uniform, with his devoted fiancee at his side.

In court: Campbell and Zito arrived at family court in Flemington, New Jersey earlier this year in Nazi uniform

History: Campbell first hit headlines after it emerged he had named his son, center, Adolf Hitler. He had four children with his former wife, Deborah, and all have Nazi-inspired names

Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours after being born in November 2011.

The New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they took the boy because violence in the home.

They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, New Jersey home.

The couple said they never abused their children and argued they were being targeted for the names they chose for their kids.

Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.
