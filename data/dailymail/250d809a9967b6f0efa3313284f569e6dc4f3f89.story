Nick Clegg last night echoed one of Tony Blair’s speeches, as he told the United Nations that Britain would always be an ‘open’ nation that was ready to stand up to tyranny.

The Deputy Prime Minister said Britain would never ‘pull up the drawbridge’ – despite MPs deciding not to take military action in Syria last month.

And he insisted that the great divide in the world was not any difference between various political or economic views, but the ‘divide between those societies which are open and closed’.

Mr Clegg’s comments appeared to refer to a speech given by Mr Blair in 2010 in which he said: ‘The big difference is no longer between Left and Right, it is between open [societies] and closed.’

Talking to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Clegg went on to say: ‘The United Kingdom is clear – we are on the side of all those who support political freedom and economic empowerment.’

He added: ‘There will be no pulling up of the drawbridge from us, no heading into retreat.

‘We will resist any impulse to turn our back on the world. And we call on all states to play their part here, just as we will play ours.’

Mr Clegg, who backed strikes against Syria, also accused Bashar al-Assad’s regime of ‘war crimes’.

His speech came as the UN announced its team of weapons inspectors is investigating another seven alleged chemical weapons attacks, including three that took place after the August 21 atrocity that shocked the world. 

In 2010, Blair said in a speech to the UN: 'The big difference is no longer between Left and Right, it is between open and closed' to which Clegg seemed to be referring
