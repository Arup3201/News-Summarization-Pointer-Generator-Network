GIFs have ruled the web during 2014, and it seems this popularity hasn’t gone unnoticed by video behemoth YouTube.

A new tool, spotted by Twitter user Andy Baio, lets people create five-second animated clips from uploaded videos.

These GIFs can then be given captions at the top and the bottom of the screen before being shared.

A new GIF tool has been spotted on YouTube that lets people create five-second animated clips from uploaded videos. It hasn’t been rolled out across the site yet, but is available on PBS Idea Channel (pictured)

The tool hasn’t been rolled out across the site yet, but is available on the PBS Idea Channel.

To create a YouTube GIF, select a video and click the Share option below the uploader’s name.

On the GIF tab, drag the slider across the clip, or manually input a start and end time, add top and bottom text, and click Create GIF.

A direct link, as well as an embed code, for the GIF will then appear. These can be shared, or added to blogs and websites.

It is one of a number of new tools that Google is trialling with a select group of YouTube users.

Other tools include improvements to comment ranking, moderator features to help manage comments, and analytics that are easier to understand.

Google has not confirmed when these tools will be rolled out more widely.

An alternative YouTube GIF creator is available at GifYouTube.com.

This site lets you paste a YouTube link and create GIFs between five and fifteen seconds in length.

Select a YouTube video.

Click the Share option below the uploader’s name and go to the GIF tab.

Either drag the slider across the clip, or manually input a start and end time. It is currently restricted to five seconds.

Add text to the top and the bottom of the clip - this is optional - and then click Create GIF.

A direct link, as well as an embed code, for the GIF will then appear. These can be shared, or added to blogs and websites. 

A link to the GIF can then be shared. 

Alternatively, the UltraVisual app lets people create GIFs from their own home videos.

Dubbed 'Instagram for GIFs', it lets users edit media, add filters, create collections and share videos.

To use Ultravisual, members take photos or record videos through the app, or import previously captured media.

Press an image to edit a file and add text, and drag and drop images around the canvas to create a collection.

Any file can be deleted by swiping left and images can also be deleted from the library by swiping down and clicking the bin icon.

To turn videos into GIFs, upload or capture the file and double-click the clip.
