The United States is sending a heavy icebreaker to help free a Russian ship and a Chinese icebreaker gripped by Antarctic ice, the Coast Guard said on Saturday.

The Polar Star is responding to a request for assistance from Australian authorities as well as from the Russian and Chinese governments, the Coast Guard statement said.

‘The U.S. Coast Guard stands ready to respond to Australia's request,’ Coast Guard Pacific Area Commander Vice Admiral Paul Zukunft said. ‘Our highest priority is safety of life at sea, which is why we are assisting in breaking a navigational path for both of these vessels.’

To the rescue! The US is sending heavy icebreaker, Polar Star, to help free a Russian ship and a Chinese icebreaker gripped by Antarctic ice, the Coast Guard said on Saturday

Priority: US Coast Guard Pacific Area Commander Vice Admiral Paul Zukunft said their highest priority is safety of life at sea and has sent the Polar Star to help the crews free their vessels in the Antarctic

Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Allyson Conroy said the Polar Star was expected to arrive on the scene on January 12 and take two to three days to complete its mission.

‘You're looking at the Antarctic, which is a challenge in itself. You have weather and you have ice,’ Conroy said in a phone interview. ‘But our crews are very well trained and we expect to be successful in this mission.’

A Chinese icebreaker that helped rescue 52 passengers from a Russian ship stranded in Antarctic ice found itself stuck in heavy ice on Friday.

A helicopter from the Snow Dragon ferried the passengers from the stranded Russian ship to an Australian icebreaker late on Thursday.

The end is in sight: The first of the 52 passengers on a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week were finally rescued by helicopter after several aborted attempts to evacuate them

The helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time over approximately five hours

Sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, so the passengers are instead being taken to an nice floe next to an Australian vessel which will eventually take them to Tasmania

The Chinese vessel now had concerns 
about its own ability to move through heavy ice, the Australian Maritime
 Safety Authority said.

The
 Russian-owned research ship, Akademik Shokalskiy, left New Zealand on 
November 28 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey
 led by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson.

It
 became trapped on December 24, 100 nautical miles east of French 
Antarctic station Dumont d'Urville and about 1,500 nautical miles south 
of Tasmania.

During 
their time on the ice, passengers amused themselves with movies, classes
 in knot tying, languages, yoga and photography, and rang in the New 
Year with dinner, drinks and a song their adventure.

The
 Coast Guard's Polar Star is 399 feet long with a maximum speed of 18 
knots. It can continuously break 6 feet of ice at three knots, and can 
break 21 feet of ice backing and ramming, the Coast Guard said.

The Polar Star was on a separate mission before being asked to help the two stuck vessels.

It
 had left its homeport of Seattle in early December on ‘Operation Deep 
Freeze’, to break a channel through the sea ice of McMurdo Sound in 
Antarctica to resupply and refuel the US Antarctic Program's McMurdo 
Station on Ross Island.

Ship: The rescue operation for the 74 passengers, comprising scientists, tourists and crew on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy, has been plagued by one delay after another since the vessel became stuck

The
 long-awaited rescue of the 52 passengers came after days of failed attempts to get the 
passengers off the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy, which got stuck 
on Christmas Eve.

Blinding snow, strong winds, fog and thick sea ice forced rescuers to turn back time and again.

Three
 icebreakers were initially dispatched to try and crack their way 
through the thick ice surrounding the ship, but all failed.

Trapped for more than a week: Ben Maddison and Ben Fisk from MV Akademik Shokalskiy work to place a wind indicator atop an ice feature near the trapped ship

The
 Aurora came within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the ship Monday, but 
fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water.

The
 Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on Nov. 28, got stuck 
Christmas Eve after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, 
freezing it in place about 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) south of 
Hobart, Tasmania.

The ship isn't in danger of sinking and has weeks' worth of supplies on board, but it cannot move.

The
 scientific team on board had been recreating Australian explorer 
Douglas Mawson's 1911 to 1913 voyage to Antarctica. Turney had hoped to 
continue the trip if an icebreaker managed to free the ship.
