A ‘talented’ 14-year-old student has been found hanged in the toilets of her secondary school.

Malika Sawyer was discovered yesterday after a suspected suicide at the end of the school day at the Harris Academy Greenwich in Eltham, south-east London.

The girl, who was a singer-songwriter, 
was taken to University Hospital Lewisham after ambulance crews responded to an 
emergency at around 5pm - and efforts were made to resuscitate her.

But she was pronounced dead about two 
hours later. Shocked students posted tributes on Facebook and Twitter to
Malika today, who was described by teachers as ‘academically gifted’ 
and ‘creative’.

One friend said: ‘Such a talented girl. RIP Malika - thoughts are with your closest family and friends.’

She was the third teenager in 24 
hours believed to have ended their life after Charleigh Disbrey, 15, and
Mert Karaoglan, 18, were hit by a train in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, 
on Monday night.

The aspiring young musician said on a social networking website that she was a ‘fun, bubbly person, who wants to make a musical impact on the world’.

Malika set up a YouTube page to post videos of her music, including a self-penned song called Get Over You, beneath which she had written: ‘Just letting a piece of my heart out there.’

On another social networking website, Malika wrote of her love of singer Ed Sheeran.

A spokesman for her school called the news ‘deeply saddening’, saying: ‘Following an incident after school, one of our Year 10 students, Malika Sawyer, died yesterday evening in hospital.

‘The police have confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances. Malika was academically gifted and keenly involved in many other aspects of the academy, including sport and the arts.

‘It is deeply saddening that she will not be able to fulfil her potential. We have spoken to students and offered them our support where this is needed.’

How Malika Sawyer described herself

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they had been called to reports of a teenage girl found dead just after 5pm yesterday. She was officially pronounced dead in hospital at around 6.50pm.

The spokesman said: ‘Next of kin are aware and a post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course.

‘Enquiries into the circumstances of the incident are being carried out by officers from Greenwich borough. We can confirm the death is being treated as non-suspicious.’

A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said: ‘Extensive efforts were made to resuscitate her both at the scene and on the way to Lewisham Hospital.’

Harris Academy Greenwich was previously called Eltham Foundation School, before it was taken over by the Harris Federation group of academies last summer.
