A teenager who survived two deadly plane 
crashes that took the lives of his entire immediate family has returned 
to the basketball court after three years - and sunk his first shot.

Austin Hatch, 19, has spent the past three years re-learning how to 
breathe, eat and walk after surviving a plane crash that killed 
his father and stepmother in Charlevoix, Michigan. A 2003 crash on the same route killed Austin’s mother, brother, and sister which he also survived.

The teenager returned to the court on Wednesday and sank the first shot he attempted for Loyola High School in Los Angeles in the fourth quarter.

Austin Hatch, 19, who survived two plane crashes sunk his first shot during his return to the basketball court after three years spent recovering and dealing with the loss of his entire immediate family

Austin Hatch, 19, scored his first basketball hoop after spending three years recovering from a plane crash which killed his father and stepmother

Hatch is now living with his uncle's family in 
California and attending the Pasadena high school after deciding to leave 
his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana as part of his recovery.

The 19-year-old had been committed to play for the University of Michigan prior to his near-fatal flight.

In November, he signed a letter of intent to John Beilein, basketball coach at UM, who decided to honor the scholarship and make the young man part of the 2014 recruiting class.

The Loyola team won the game with an 87-59 victory on Wednesday.

Loyola coach Jamal Adams told ESPN: 'He
 hit a 3, and our bench erupted. It was unbelievable what
 that kid has gone through and how hard he's worked.

'That kid has taught
 me you can come back from anything, that nothing is impossible. It was a
 spiritual moment.'

On June 24, 2011, Austin, his father, his
 stepmother, and the family labradoodle Brady smashed into a garage of 
the Charlevoix, Michigan airport. Only Austin and Brady made it out 
alive.

Just 10 days before the crash, Austin - then the standout star of Canterbury High School’s team in Indiana - had agreed to play for the University of Michigan upon his graduation.

During his arduous recovery from a brain trauma and other injuries, Austin kept his focus on his dream of playing college basketball.

‘Basketball has always given me something to shoot for,’ he said during an interview in November. In addition to his sports-related announcement, Austin touched on his life’s tragedy at the news conference.

‘Aside from the physical trauma that I suffered in the accident,’ he said. ‘The emotional pain will never fully subside.’

Unthinkable: The wreckage of Dr Hatch's plane after it crashed into a garage in Charlevoix, Michigan on June 24, 2011. Just a few years before, a similar crash left Austin's mother, brother, and sister dead

Terrible twist: Dr Stephen Hatch died in a plane crash in 2011 - eight years after he survived a deadly smash that killed his wife and two children

Earlier crash: Austin and his father survived 
another crash in 2003 that killed the boy’s mother, Julie, left, and his
 two siblings, Lindsay, 11, centre and Ian, 5, right

Austin, who was eight years old at the time, only survived the 2003 crash when his father flung him out of the burning plane.

Austin was given a small measure of 
comfort after the crash when his dog, a labradoodle named Brady, was found 
wandering near the crash site in the days following the accident.

His 38-year-old mother Julie, 11-year-old sister Lindsay and 5-year-old brother Ian all died in the crash.

Best friends: Austin Patch and his labradoodle Brady were the only survivors of the horrific plane crash in 2011 that killed his doctor father and stepmother
