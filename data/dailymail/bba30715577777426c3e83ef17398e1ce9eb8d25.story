Managerless Crystal Palace have been at the forefront football headlines since the departure of Tony Pulis just over a week ago. The club had hoped to make Tim Sherwood their new manager, after turning down Malky Mackay amidst the  'textgate' scandal. Sherwood rejected the chance to become the new Crystal Palace manager however, despite being out of a job.

That leaves Palace still hunting for a new boss, although in the meantime they will have to focus all of their energy on a tricky home clash against Sam Allardyce's West Ham United.

Ahead of this intriguing Premier League fixture, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats... Here is all the information you need for Crystal Palace's home clash with West Ham...

Team news

Crystal Palace 

Scott Dann has an 'outside chance' of facing West Ham in Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League clash at Selhurst Park on Saturday, according to Keith Millen.

Palace's caretaker manager will put Dann through a late fitness test as the central defender battles to beat a hip strain in time for the Hammers' visit.

Adrian Mariappa trained on Thursday following a rib complaint, while Jonny Williams and Jerome Thomas are also fit to return.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Ward, Delaney, McCarthy, Dann, Hangeland, Jedinak, O'Keefe, Bannan, Ledley, Garvan, Williams, Guedioura, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Kebe, Gayle, Murray, Campbell, Chamakh.

West Ham 

Sam Allardyce is short of defensive options as he looks to guide West Ham to their first Barclays Premier League win of the season at Crystal Palace.

James Collins is suspended after his red card in the defeat to Tottenham, with Joey O'Brien (knee), James Tomkins and Carl Jenkinson (both hamstring) all struggling for fitness.

Seeing red: James Collins (second right) was sent off in the 1-0 defeat by Tottenham on the opening day

Matt Jarvis could be involved following a thigh injury but Ravel Morrison (groin) is not ready to return. Andy Carroll (ankle) is a long-term absentee, with Allardyce hopeful that either Enner Valencia or Diafra Sakho will be fit enough to start in attack.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins Reece, Demel, Jenkinson, Potts, Noble, Kouyate, Poyet, Diame, Nolan, Whitehead, Downing, Vaz Te, Cole, Maiga, Sakho, Zarate.

After going three entire Premier League seasons (and 97 games) without a goal, Brede Hangeland scored on his Premier League debut for Crystal Palace.

Marouane Chamakh conceded 11 fouls on the opening weekend of the season, more than 10 of the 20 Premier League teams did in total.

Finding form: Marouane Chamakh scored the only goal as Crystal Palace defeated West Ham at Selhurst Park last Decemeber

Palace conceded twice from set-pieces in their opening game, one more than they did in the whole of Tony Pulis’ regime (excludes penalties).

Palace (7) scored fewer goals in London derbies than any other Premier League capital club last season.

West Ham haven’t lost their opening two Premier League games since 2010/11, a season in which they were relegated from the division.

Palace have had fewer shots than any other Premier League team this season (2).

Keith Millen has taken only four points in five games as temporary manager of Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

Palace have conceded at least two goals in each of their last four Premier League games after conceding only five times in the previous nine.
