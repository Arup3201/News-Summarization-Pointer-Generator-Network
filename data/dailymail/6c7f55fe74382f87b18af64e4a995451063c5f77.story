France claimed yesterday to have killed hundreds of militants in Mali.

The country’s defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also told a French radio station that the conflict was a ‘real war’  with ‘terrorists’.

Just one French soldier has so far died in action in Mali.

French armoured vehicles are seen heading towards Gao, northern Mali and are expected to withdraw by the end of March

'It’s a real war ... when we go outside of the centre of cities that have been taken, we meet residual jihadists,' said Mr Le Drian.

President Francois Hollande said France may start pulling out of west Africa nation at the end of March.

That will depend on an increase in the deployment of African forces, which are meant to take over the international effort to secure Mali.

France is expected to keep a rapid reaction force in Mali to back up the U.N. force.

Mr Le Drian said French aircraft are continuing airstrikes every night on suspected militant arms depots and mine-making sites.

On the ground, troops have found war material, weapons manuals and makeshift laboratories for constructing improvised explosive devices.

'We discovered preparations for a true terrorist sanctuary,' he said.

France launched a swift military intervention on January 11 against Islamist extremists who had taken over northern Mali, where they imposed a harsh version of Shariah law.

The French-led troops have taken the key city of Gao and control the capital of Timbuktu, but plans to move forward on the last major city in control of the Islamist militants, Kindal, have been hampered by sandstorms.

The country currently has 4,000 soldiers deployed in Mali fighting alongside 3,800 local soldiers, but is expected to keep a rapid reaction force in Mali to back up the U.N. force.
