It was a brutal murder case of an elderly Utah woman that had sat cold for 23 years.

But now police say they the mysterious death of 78-year-old Lucille Johnson in 1991 - who was found bludgeoned and strangled in her Salt Lake City home - has been solved, all because of some pieces of Lego.

The toy building blocks were found in the entry way of the house in Holladay and stored away as part of an evidence file following the crime, which Mrs Johnson's family believed they would never get the answers to, according to Fox 13.

That file was reopened last year, with DNA testing discovering residue that linked them to the alleged killer - John Sansing, 47, a convicted murderer currently on death row in Arizona for an unrelated case.

Vital: Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder shows the Lego pieces that allowed investigators to crack the cold case during a news conference on Thursday

DNA: Investigators were able to find fingerprints on the Lego from Sansing's then-five-year-old son, who they believe was in Johnson's house playing with the toys at the time of the murder 23 years ago

Scene: Lucille Johnson was killed at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Avondale on February 2, 1991

Fingerprints on the Lego were matched to Sansing's juvenile son, who they now believe was playing in the house when his father allegedly murdered Mrs Johnson.

Detectives also submitted scrapings from 
under Johnson’s fingernails to scan for DNA, with investigators matching
 the DNA profile to Sansing.

At the time of the killing, police believed the person responsible had been invited into the home by Mrs Johnson.

Investigators say Sansing and Mrs Johnson did not know each other.

No motive for the killing has been released, however jewelry was missing from the house.

It's possible Sansing used his son to gain entry to the house.

Sansing, who has been charged with capital murder in Utah for Mrs Johnson's death, is now being looked at for other unsolved murders in the state between 1989 and 1991.

'Occasionally we encounter people who are evil,' Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder said at a news conference Thursday.

'The individual who perpetrated this is nothing short of that.'

'When you hear the details of this particular case, you will see that this individual is barely human.

'While in that home, it is clear Mr. Sansing bludgeoned Lucille to death, leaving his five-year-old apparently in the living room to play with Legos.

'On those Legos were the fingerprints of Mr. Sansing’s juvenile son.'

The break in the case after all these years have lifted a great weight for Mrs Johnson's family.

'It was very important that it be solved,' Jerry Johnson, Lucille Johnson's son, told ABC News.

'I wasn't sure it would ever be solved.'

'I am so grateful, so very grateful to the police department for the work that they’ve done,' Johnson's daughter, Shirley England, told ABC News.

'I don’t think closure is the right word because you never close something like this.

'It’s been a terrible thing in our life.'

Grateful: Lucille Johnson's children, Shirley England and Jerry Johnson, said their mother's unsolved murder has been 'a terrible thing in our life'

Two years after Johnson died, Sansing pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated assault, a class A misdemeanor, in a separate case, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

He then moved to Arizona in 1995.

On February 24, 1998, Sansing, a married father of four, called the Living Springs Assembly of God Church in Avondale, Arizona, and requested a food box be delivered to his house.

When the church worker, Elizabeth 'Trudy' Calabrese, 41, arrived, Sansing tied her up with electrical cords and hit her on the head with a broom, according to Supreme Court of Arizona records.

Police said at the time Sansing's children witnessed him and his wife, Kara Kay Sansing, 28, tie up Calabrese.

Sansang then went and dumped her car before returning to his home and sexually assaulting Calabrese.

He then stabbed the victim to death, court records show.

Murderer: John Sansing waits in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday, September 30, 1999, to be sentenced after pleading guilty for first degree murder in the death of Elizabeth 'Trudy' Calabrese in February 1998. Sansing was sentenced to death for the torture, raping and stabbing of the church volunteer who was delivering free food to his family

Sansing left Calabrese's body in the bedroom while he and his wife - who was home the entire time - slept in the living room.

Sansing woke in the middle of the night and hid the victim's body under some clothes in his backyard, between a shed and a wall, while his children slept.

All four children saw the dead body, police said at the time.

Sansing's wife, who told police she had witnessed the stabbing murder, was charged separately.

A jury found Sansing guilty of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and sexual assault, and he was sentenced to death

It is not known whether he will be extradited to Utah to face the new murder charges.
