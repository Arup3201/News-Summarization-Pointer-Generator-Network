A viola dubbed ‘the finest in existence’ is expected to sell for a record-breaking £27million – making it the most expensive musical instrument in history.

The Macdonald is one of just ten violas made by Antonio Stradivari that are still in existence, and the first to be offered on the open market for half a century.

It dates back to 1719 and is one of two violas the Italian luthier made during the ‘golden period’ of 1700 to 1720, when he created his finest instruments.

The Macdonald viola takes its name from Godfrey Bosville, the 3rd Baron Macdonald, who bought it in the 1820s. 

The instrument, which is slightly larger than a violin, is being sold by Sotheby’s and Ingles & Hayday in a sealed bid auction from now until June.

Bids are expected to be in excess of £27million.

The
 current record is held by the Lady Blunt Stradivarius violin, which was
 sold in 2011 for £9.3million to raise money for victims of the Japanese
 tsunami.

Prestigious: Internationally-renowned violist David Aaron Carpenter has his turn on the £27m piece

Tim Ingles, director of Ingles & Hayday, said: ‘It is immaculately preserved. No Stradivari viola has been on the market for the last fifty years so this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.’

Antonio Stradivari was an Italian luthier who lived from 1644 until 1737. It is thought just 600 of his violins, 50 cellos and ten violas remain in existence.

For the past 200 years, collectors have strived to obtain a Stradivari 'quartet' - two of his violins, a cello and viola.

But this has become an almost impossible task because of the number of violas - with the Macdonald one of only two in private hands.

Sothebys and Ingles & Hayday yesterday (Weds) described The Macdonald as being of 'incomparable quality' and the sale an 'historic event'.

The front is of alpine spruce while the back is of a single piece of maple.

Its almost complete coating of Stradivari's famous varnish has remained in a remarkably pure and undamaged state, according to the auctioneers.

The consistent rippling flame of the maple slopes downward from left to right, providing a beautiful shifting pattern beneath the varnish.

It was last purchased for British-Austrian musician Peter Schidlof of the Amadeus Quartet in 1964 and is being offered for sale by his family after he died in 1987.

David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, added: 'Every field is defined by one outstanding masterpiece which casts its shadow not only on its own domain but far beyond.

'The instruments of Stradivari are in a class of their own among the pinnacles of human craftsmanship and the Macdonald viola stands at the unquestioned summit.'
