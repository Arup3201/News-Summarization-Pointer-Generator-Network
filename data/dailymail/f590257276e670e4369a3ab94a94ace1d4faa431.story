Barack Obama's top strategist said that the campaign will take a 'hard look' at how to approach future debates in the light of last night's failure - and appealed to the media to challenge Mitt Romney on the issues which the President avoided in Denver.

All but stating that the Republican had won the debate, David Axelrod conceded that the performance aspect was 'not the President's strong suit in these events' but insisted that 'I don't see us adding huge amounts of additional prep time.'

The remarks came after the Obama campaign was left reeling by Mr Romney's knockout performance in the candidates' first head-to-head clash, with polls suggesting that voters regarded the former governor of Massachusetts as the debate winner by a margin of more than two to one.

Good humour: The Republican candidate clearly needed no cheering up on his campaign plane

Democratic strategists are now fighting to preserve the narrow poll lead which Mr Obama enjoyed in the run-up to the debate, as fired-up Republicans aim to capitalise on the primetime thrashing and entrench the image of Mr Romney as a potential President.

Mr Axelrod, speaking on a campaign conference call, made an appeal to reporters to make the points that Obama himself had failed to make in the debate

'All of you who travel on the road with Governor Romney know that he just few weeks ago stood up and said we didn't need any more teachers,' he said. 'Last night he couldn't be more enthusiastic about teachers and more teachers.'

Mr Romney had delivered 'a very vigorous performance but one that was devoid of honesty', Mr Axelrod said.

'And so today, as the day after, I think the question for you [the media], for the American people is really one of character and whether or not a candidacy that's so fundamentally rooted in hiding the truth and the facts from the American people and deception is the basis of trust on which you assign the presidency to a person. 

'So that is what we are going to focus on moving forward. We're going to hold Governor Romney accountable for the things that he said last night and we're going to make him justify those claims - as I hope you will make him justify those claims. 

'Because we need an an honest and a genuine and realistic plan to move forward and not a bunch of lines designed to get you through a debate.'

Mr Axelrod said that Mr Romney was 'completely untethered from the truth' and 'knowingly and willfully tried to deceive senior citizens'

Referring to post-debate polls, he added: 'People are willing to give Governor Romney credit for his performance but that didn't necessarily translate into support for him for President. He may win the Oscar for his performance last night but he’s not going to win the presidency for his performance last night.'

He signalled that there would be changes to Mr Obama's approach to the second debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on October 16th.

'He made a choice last night to answer the questions that were asked and to talk to the American people about what we need to do to move forward and to not get into serial fact checking with Governor Romney, which can be an exhausting never ending pursuit. 

'But obviously moving forward we're going to take a hard look at this and we're going to have to make some judgements as to where to draw the line in these debates and how to use our time.

'In terms of changes... it's like a play-offs in sports, you evaluate after every contest and you make adjustments and I'm sure that we will make adjustments. I think there will be some strategic judgements that will have to be made and we'll make them.'

Admission: David Axelrod confessed to Mr Obama's weaknesses and asked the media to push Mr Romney harder

Speaking in Denver the day after the debate, Mr Obama took a more aggressive attitude, speaking loudly and assertively as he defended his record in front of a sympathetic crowd.

'We succeed when the middle class gets bigger,' he said. 'We succeed not from the top down but from the middle out.'

The President also spoke about his energy policy, boasting of the progress his administration has made on renewable energy and adding: 'The United States of America today is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades.'

He also brought out the harsh words for Mr Romney which he had largely avoided the night before, saying: 'Governor Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be President, you owe the American people the truth.'

Mr Obama continued: 'Governor Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be President, you owe the American people the truth.'

The vocal audience provided a boost which the President was denied during the silent debate, notably when one fan shouted out: 'We believe in you!'

Clash: More than 58 million people tuned in to the Obama-Romney debate, far more than the total who watched Obama-McCain in 2008.

Contest: The debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer, who drew criticism for his passive demeanour

In the debate itself, however, it was Mr Romney who was on the offensive, shining in what was arguably the most high-profile
 moment of his political career so far.

The Republican challenger denounced 
Mr Obama's performance over the past four years, and at one point 
compared the President's behaviour to that of his sons when they were 
children.

‘Look, I’ve got five boys,' he said. 
'I’m used to people saying something that’s not always true, but just 
keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I’ll believe it.’

From the outset of 
the debate, Mr Romney chided Mr Obama for promising to halve America’s 
annual deficit but instead doubling it and even compared him to a little
boy who can’t tell the truth.

Hitting
Mr Obama with a blizzard of statistics, Mr Romney also hit back hard at
what he saw as the President mischaracterising his plans: ‘Virtually 
everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.'

Mr Romney was at the top of his game 
from the outset, coming across as pithier and punchier than Mr Obama, 
who seemed taken aback by being confronted so relentlessly and struggled
to speak concisely.

The challenger's dominance came 
despite his having four minutes less talking time than the incumbent - 
Mr Romney spoke for 38 minutes and 32 seconds, while Mr Obama held the 
spotlight for 42 minutes and 50 seconds.

A CNN poll of registered voters who 
watched the debate reflected Mr Romney's perceived victory, as 67 per 
cent of respondents regarded him as the night's winner compared to just 
25 per cent for Mr Obama.

Additionally, 58 per cent thought 
that the Republican came across as a stronger leader than the Democrat, 
while twice as many said the evening had made them more likely to vote 
for Mr Romney as said they were swayed towards the President.

Conservative columnist Charles Hurt 
wrote in the Washington Times that 'President Obama flailed all around 
the debate stage', adding: 'It was like he had been called in front of 
the principal after goofing around for four years and blowing off all 
his homework.'

He argued that the President looked 
out of his depth compared to the self-assurance of Mr Romney, and said: 
'Who knew anyone on the planet could make Mitt Romney look easy, 
relaxed, smooth and human?'

Mr Hurt concluded: 'Not since Jimmy 
Carter faced Ronald Reagan has the U.S. presidency been so 
embarrassingly represented in public. Actually, that’s an insult to 
Jimmy Carter.'

Andrew Sullivan, a respected centrist
who is a strong supporter of the President, criticised Mr Obama's 
'meandering, weak, professorial arguments' on the Daily Beast.

Comedian Bill Maher, who has donated 
$1million to a Democratic super-PAC, expressed frustration over Mr 
Obama's lacklustre performance in a series of acid tweets throughout the
debate.

At one point, he said: 'Romney looks 
more confident and energetic - he's about a minute away from holding 
Obama down and cutting his hair.'
