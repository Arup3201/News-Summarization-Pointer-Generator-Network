Japanese researchers have developed ‘Anti-Google Glass’ technology which stops those wearing the specs from seeing their face.

The team have created their own pair of specs which have 11 LEDs on them which emit near infrared light into Google Glass’ cameras.

The light is not visible to the human eye, but on film it is so bright that you cannot see the person’s face.

The research is the most extreme instance yet of people trying to avoid being filmed or have their picture taken by Google Glass.

The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited release to 2,000 people but will be more widely available later this year.

They have caused concern because they have a camera next to the wearer’s eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working

The ‘Anti Google Glass’ technology currently only works on camera lenses which are sensitive to infrared light.

But lead researcher professor Isao Echizen of the National Institute of Informatics in Japan said they were working on reflective materials which will have the same effect and be less obtrusive.

He said: ‘Light from these near infrared LEDs can’t be seen by the human eye, but when it passes through the camera’s imaging device, it appears bright’. 

In a video posted online by the NII he also says that he developed the technology because he is especially worried about facial recognition software which has not yet been developed, but could soon come in the future.

Wearing sunglasses is not enough and will not stop your face from being detected as you can be identified using your nose as well as your eyes.

A Google Glass porn app was banned instantly after X-rated film producers said they wanted to use it to explore point-of-view shots.

Cafe owners in the US have banned it from their premises to respect the privacy of customers.

And those wearing the technology could be banned from American strip clubs, cinemas and casinos because their owners don’t want them filming there.

Lap dance clubs in America said that they would treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out.

Google’s chairman Eric Schmidt once admitted that the aim with Google Glass was to ‘go right up to the creepy line and not cross it’.

But the public clearly feels differently and in France those wearing Google Glass style specs have been subjected to ‘cyber discrimination’.

University of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head.
