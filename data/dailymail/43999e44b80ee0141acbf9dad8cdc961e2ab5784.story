Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was the first to endorse Portuguese compatriot Luis Figo’s highly unlikely bid for the FIFA presidency.

However, that support was not enough to stop Chelsea from cancelling a press conference at Stamford Bridge where Figo was due to launch his election manifesto. Instead the event took place at Wembley on Thursday.

The Paris Metro racism row involving Chelsea fans would have put paid to Figo’s appearance there in any case, because racism questions would have overshadowed the event. But it emerged on Thursday that Chelsea called off Figo’s launch ahead of the Metro incident because the club wanted to stay apolitical and felt it ‘inappropriate’ to host a challenger to Sepp Blatter.

Chelsea weren’t aware when the booking was first made that it involved publicising Figo’s manifesto — and action was taken immediately it became clear what would be happening.

The decision was made at communications department level, according to Chelsea. And it can only be speculation as to whether owner Roman Abramovich would have wanted Figo using his club, with Russia the next hosts of the World Cup organised by Blatter-led FIFA.

Meanwhile, Figo’s manifesto was full of varied proposals from redistributing more money to grassroots football to a 48-country World Cup.

But he still came across as a pawn in UEFA’s multi-ball attack on Blatter rather than a genuine contender. However, at least he could reel off FIFA executive names in answer to the inevitable question about how many he knew.

The ECB’s restructuring, which neither new CEO Tom Harrison nor chairman-elect Colin Graves have explained, includes the ruling body’s best known figure Mike Gatting being axed from his role as managing director of cricket partnerships. 

Former England captain Gatting has been reduced to a 50-days-per-year ambassadorial role, which might explain his silence over such shabby treatment. The ECB are already advertising for Gatting’s replacement to be called director of participation and growth.

Sky Sports, who have already broken the bank for their £4.2billion spend on Premier League football, have pledged another £88m to the Football League to extend their deal for another season in 2018-19. The FL have also settled a solidarity deal with the PL that could see Championship clubs getting £4m a season from the redistribution.

The Olympic Stadium renovation is going well enough for UK Athletics to be confident of staging a two-day Diamond League meeting there — plus a third day for Paralympics — in July.

Leeds in legal battles

Leeds, pantomime club for all seasons, are still unravelling dysfunctional governance from before Ken Bates sold up in 2012.

Former director Melvyn Levi’s wife Carole had her harassment case against Bates upheld at the Court of Appeal before three judges.

Levi had won his harassment case — his wife initially lost — against Bates three years ago. It followed Bates using Leeds’ in-house Yorkshire Radio station to broadcast appeals for Levi’s whereabouts and using the matchday programme to suggest Levi’s marriage was in trouble. 

Levi is now consulting lawyers on whether to pursue former Leeds chief executive Shaun Harvey, now Football League CEO, on the same charge. Levi alleges Harvey was involved in organising the radio broadcasts. Harvey made no comment.

Next week’s International FA Board summit in Belfast will see FIFA president Sepp Blatter collide with the FA’s Greg Dyke and David Gill, who were both vocal at last year’s FIFA Congress about the need for a new leader of FIFA. But Northern Ireland FA president Jim Shaw, hosting the meeting, said: ‘I’m sure all IFAB delegates will concentrate on the rules agenda rather than any other business.’

The most likely outbreak of hostilities in the FIFA presidential election is between the spin doctors. FIFA have expressed concern about PR company Vero working for two candidates, Luis Figo and Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein, which no regulation prevents. 

But FIFA’s in-house PR team will breach election rules if they promote Blatter’s bid for a fifth term — which they are in danger of doing until Blatter forms an independent campaign team.
