The girls said it ruined their whole evening and was entirely uncalled for.

Young lesbian couple Taylor Campione and Kelsi Culpepper were told off by a security guard for kissing each other at a baseball game last month.

He told them to ‘adhere to the Ten Commandments’ after seeing them kiss during a Minnesota Twins v Los Angeles Angels game at Target Field.

The Minneapolis couple arrived late to the game and Miss Culpepper gave Miss Campione a quick kiss before she entered a bathroom.

But a security guard wearing a Twins hat immediately walked over, shaking his head and saying ‘you can’t do that’, reported CityPages.

Miss Campione replied that she ‘can kiss whoever I want to’, but the guard hit back by saying: ‘Well, we don't play grab ass here’.

When Miss Culpepper came out of the 
bathroom and found out what happened, she asked him what was wrong with 
her kissing her girlfriend.

He is said to have then repeated his 
‘grab ass’ comment and added: 'Well, here in the stadium, we adhere to 
the 10 Commandments’.

Miss Campione told CityPages that the comments made them ‘super upset’ and ‘super uncomfortable’ for the rest of the evening.

Location: The incident happened outside a bathroom at Target Field

The security guard has worked for 
the club for almost ten years.

He has since been reprimanded for ‘unacceptable’ 
behaviour, a Twins spokesman said.

But he has not been fired and still works at the Target Field stadium.

Now the couple are claiming discrimination for sexual orientation and filing a complaint with the state’s human rights department.

The girls’ story has received much media exposure and they say they are pleased with this as they hope their story will educate people.
