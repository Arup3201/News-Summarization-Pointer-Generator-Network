Her constant flirting with TOWIE star Mario Falcone on UK's Celebrity Big Brother is thought to be one of the reasons why her short-lived marriage to Doug Hutchinson collapsed.

And now newly single Courtney Stodden has revealed that she's still in contact with her former housemate.

The 19-year-old says she often speaks to Mario on the telephone, and is making plans to see him when she visits London again in the near future.

'We talk... Obviously, he’s a whole world away and I'm way over here but we talk,' she reveals in an exclusive interview with the MailOnline.

'I’m going to be going to London here and there so yeah, I’ll probably meet up with him and Warren (Gatland) and all the other fun and crazy people that I know. And when they come here too.'

Courtney, who sensationally announced her split with Doug, 53, earlier this month, says that while she hasn't thought too much about dating again just yet, she wouldn't rule out a relationship with the 25-year-old reality star, who is closer to her own age.

'I haven’t thought that far. I’m kind of a personality girl and I go by personality and who can make me laugh,' she explains. 'If anybody can make me laugh, they have a date'.

The bubbly blonde also admits that Doug was none too thrilled about her relationship with Mario in the house. 

Courtney was seen constantly flirting with the TOWIE star on the reality show, with the pair getting especially close during one housemate challenge, which saw them being tied together.

Several days into her stint on Big Brother, Doug paid his teen bride a visit, and while the Green Mile actor was thrilled to be reunited with Courtney, the feeling was not so mutual. 

As the teen relished in her newfound independence, the couple drifted apart.

Courtney says that things with Doug got so bad after the show, the couple even stopped having sex.

'When I came back from Big Brother, we didn’t have sex at all,' she explains. 'We did once after I saw him and that was it.

'I’m
a girl, a young a woman, and as a girl I feel we have to be emotionally
connected to be turned on and want to be intimate with someone.

'So emotionally speaking, in a romantic way, I was so checked out. So we weren’t having sex.'

And to add further insult to injury, 
Courtney says now they have split she won't miss having sex with her ex-husband, who she 
believes is 'slowing down a little bit'.

Instead she is keen to discuss her own ferocious sexual appetite, admitting that she wants to experience love making of 'all kinds'.

'Our
sex was good, I’m not going to lie, but I’m a young girl who wants to 
experience sex of all kinds and he’s an older man and he’s slowing down 
a  little bit,' she says.

'I think even if we were having sex day in and day out, I think I’d still be feeling this way. I just wanted more sex.'

Innocence: Courtney was just 16-years-old when she married Doug, 53

Earlier this month, Courtney and Doug 
signed a separation agreement, stating that the couple will 'continue to
support one another as friends and business partners'.

But when it comes to the pair's divorce, it remains to be seen as to how they will split their assets.

Courtney reveals that she didn't sign a pre-nup with Doug before the couple exchanged vows in Las Vegas over two years ago.

She claims that at the time of their impending nuptials she had suggested one, but Doug flat out refused.

'I offered and he said, "I don’t want to do that because I trust you and we’re getting married"' she insists. 

'He didn’t want a pre-nup. So we’ve talked about what we want to do financially now.'

For now the couple are still under the same roof, with Doug 'staying in one bedroom and Courtney in the other'.

Reunion: Courtney says she speaks to Mario on the phone and will see him when she next goes to London

But
the decision to remain living together is surely a difficult one, 
especially for Doug who has been left 'heartbroken' by the split.

Courtney
also describes the moment she told her husband that she was 'unhappy' 
in their marriage, just weeks after her stint in the Big Brother house.

'He
was heartbroken. He already knew, but to hear me tell him that I’m not 
happy in this marriage kind of put it into reality for him,' she says.

Moving on: Courtney, seen with this gentleman at an event just last week, says she wouldn't discount being with an older man again

'I
think it was kind of surreal for to hear me say that. So of course, he 
was crying, I was crying. We both didn’t want this to happen but we’re 
both trying to get through it.'

According to Courtney, Doug is also having difficulty coming to terms with his ex-wife getting intimate with other men.

'I’ve experienced different people sexually but he (Doug) was the first person I ever fully had sex with,' she explains.

No pre-nup: Courtney also revealed that she did not sign a pre-nup with Doug before the pair exchanged vows in 2011

'But I think it burned him, the idea of me being with someone else. I think it kicked him in the stomach.

'I think he wasn’t fond of the idea at
first but he actually told me last night, "You deserve to go out with 
your friends, you deserve to meet other people, you deserve to make love
to another man.

"You deserve to be young and independent." It was great for him to say that.'

And while her first experience with a much older man didn't exactly go to plan, Courtney won't be ruling out dating another person twice, if not older than her age.

'Never say never, but I’m going to try to lower the age a little bit, that’s my goal, but who knows,' she says.

'I will learn from this, I’m not planning on going out with another 53-year-old, that’s for sure. I mean, people say age is just a number and I said that also and obviously age isn’t just a number.

'There are some things you have to contend with. I’m not saying just because there’s an age difference it won’t work.

'There are some successful marriages between people with an age gap but its not for everybody and obviously I’ll keep that in mind for the future.'

After Doug married Courtney when she was just 16-years-old, his family, friends and even his agent turned their backs on him.

The star, who appeared in the Oscar winning movie, The Green Mile, even lost several acting jobs. 

Courtney admits that at the beginning of their marriage she felt responsible, but after recently ending things with the actor she feels she can finally feel free from the guilt.

'I did feel responsibility because he did lose his family, his agent did drop him, his work stopped coming in, so I definitely felt a huge responsibility on my shoulders, especially for our not being happy in the marriage and admitting that to him because I’m sure that probably scared him to death,' she says.

'So I did feel guilty then but after his reaction and us going through the initial sadness of the breakup, he said, "I love you and I want you to be happy, please don’t feel guilty."

'His reaction really took that away from me, so I don’t feel guilty anymore.'

As for the future, Courtney is just happy to be doing things that normal teenagers do, including finally getting her drivers license.

She is also planning on moving forward with her acting career and hints that she has a reality show in the pipeline.

As for her well-documented surgical enhancements, the teen star says she is planning on getting more in the future.

'When gravity starts taking place, yeah,' she says.

'Anybody who has breast implants has to go in every 8 to 10 years to keep them up so I will have to go in and fix that here and there but other than that I’m really happy with myself.'
