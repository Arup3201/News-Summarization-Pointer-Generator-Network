Kenny Dalglish has been assured his job is safe after Damien Comolli was forced out on a dramatic day at Anfield.

Director of football Comolli has left in the start of a shake-up at the club.

He was later followed out of the club by
Liverpool's Head of Sports Medicine and Science Peter Brukner. The 
Australian also leaves the club with immediate effect.

Comolli was told by owner John W Henry that he was no longer wanted alongside manager Dalglish.

But chairman Tom Werner insists they are happy with Dalglish despite the club's difficult season.

The position of the Reds boss has 
come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a woeful run in the league in 
which they lost five of six matches, ending their hopes of qualifying 
for the Champions League.

Werner said: 'We've got great confidence in Kenny. We feel the team is going to make strides in the future and he enjoys our full support.'

Dalglish will also be handed money to spend this summer as they attempt to catch the likes of the Manchester giants United and City.

Werner said: 'We've had a strategy that we have agreed on. There was some disconnect on the implementation of that. That strategy is a strong one and it will continue.

'We need to build a strong system under the first team. We're hard at work identifying transfer targets and we will be better next year.'

Werner also admitted they have decided to ring the changes as they attempt to improve for next season.

He said: 'I think it's fair to say no supporter would be delighted with the results we've achieved this year. We feel we are a club that needs to be perceived as the strongest club in football and we want to get there.

'Frankly, we make these decisions with a great deal of care because it's our track record in Boston to give people authority and we've had great success with our manager, who was there for eight years, and our general manager, so we prefer stability.

'But when it's time to act, we need to act. We're coming close to the end of the season and the transfer window for the summer, and we felt it was important to make this change expeditiously.'

Liverpool have spent £105million under Kenny Dalglish and Comolli's watch and Werner admitted the return on the pitch wasn't good enough.

He said: 'I would say we certainly have the resources to compete with anybody in football. I wouldn't want to get specific about any particular decision that's been made.

'We feel there is enough talent on the pitch to win and, as I said, we've been dissatisfied, as most supporters have been, with the results so far. But we're also talking about the future - we have a strategy we need implemented and we felt Damien was probably not the right person to implement that strategy.'

Asked whether the would appoint another director of football, he added: 'We're still confident the structure we've discussed is the right structure. That doesn't mean we won't look at tweaking it, but we feel a collective group of people making football decisions is healthy.

'The debate is healthy. Part of the reason we made this decision now is because we want to start the process of finding an excellent replacement.

'We don't have any specific candidates in mind. Part of the reason we made this decision yesterday was to be in the best possible position to move forward as quickly as possible.'

The Frenchman, who cited family reasons for his departure, was responsible for finding new players for the club - including the £105million they spent last year.

In a statement on the club's official website, Comolli said: 'I am grateful to have been given the 
opportunity to work at Liverpool and am happy to move on from the Club 
and back to France for family reasons. 

'I wish the Club all the best for
the future.'

Owner Henry said: 'We are grateful for all of Damien's efforts on behalf of Liverpool and wish him all the best for the future.'

The club's chairman Tom Werner added: 'The Club needs to move forward and we now have a huge game on Saturday.

Under-fire: Carroll and Downing were two of Comolli's two high-profile signings

'It is important that everyone joins us in supporting the manager and gets behind Kenny and the team and focuses on a strong finish to the season.'

Initially brought in by new owners American Fenway Sports Group in November 2010 to help ease their first move into football, Comolli's appointment preceded Dalglish's by nearly two months but, once the Scot replaced Roy Hodgson, there was no doubt who was in charge.

Even Comolli`s promotion from director of football strategy to a wider role the following March failed to alter the balance of power that club icon Dalglish controlled.

And while Comolli has been criticised for his role in Liverpool's recent - and so far unsuccessful - transfer policy, the Reds boss stressed he had the final word on signings.

When FSG took over in October 2010 much was made of their intention to employ the moneyball theory, which had been so successful at their other high-profile acquisition of the Boston Red Sox baseball franchise, to transfers.

That essentially meant finding players who were potentially underachieving at other clubs but who could be signed relatively cheaply, made into a success and therefore have a much higher re-sale value.

However, in the three transfer 
windows Dalglish has overseen, the owners have forked out the best part 
of £125million, with a net spend of about £70million.

Those deals included an eye-watering 
£35million for Andy Carroll, £20million for Stewart Downing, £16million 
for Jordan Henderson.
Dalglish's best deals have been for Craig Bellamy, who came in on a free
but has no re-sale value because of his age, and Jose Enrique 
(£6million from Newcastle), with only Luis Suarez, at £22.8million, 
coming close to justifying his price tag.

With the owners' pre-season ambitions
of regaining a place in the top-four ended by a run of woeful league 
results it appears the director of football experiment has been ditched.

The responsibility now lies solely 
with Dalglish, who has come in for his fair share of criticism recently,
and while that may not actually have changed much behind the scenes it 
is now more transparent and there can be no hiding behind anyone else.

Dalglish insisted Comolli was at Anfield with his blessing and was sad to see him exit.

He said: 'He's been really helpful in every transfer target we've gone for.

Big money: Adam and Jose Enrique (R) were signed by Comolli last summer

'Everyone who has come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice. Once I made the choice who I wanted.

'Damien
went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in. It's sad to see 
anyone leave the club and he goes with my best wishes.'

As
well as playing a part in the signing of Carroll, Comolli also 
contributed to one of the most dramatic days in the history of the 
Premier League by helping along the deal that took Fernando Torres to 
Chelsea for £50million late on the same day.

Earlier in his career, the 39-year-old Comolli had held a similar post at Tottenham.

He was heralded for securing deals for players such as Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Dimitar Berbatov but, much like his time at Liverpool, not all his dealings were well thought of.

The likes of David Bentley and Adel Taarabt were never able to make their mark at White Hart Lane and former manager Martin Jol was outspoken about his uneasy relationship with Comolli.

Meanwhile, managing director Ian Ayre and Dalglish thanked Brukner for his work at the club as he packed up his things.

Staying on: Dalglish thanked Comolli and Brukner for their work

'We are grateful to Peter who has been the catalyst for the transformation of our Sports Medicine and Sports Science capability at the Club since he joined two years ago,' said Ayre.

'He has been instrumental in re-defining our requirements and bringing first class people into the team, providing us with a great platform to move forward. We wish him all the best for the future.'

Dalglish added: 'The framework Peter has established has allowed us to see some very real results in relation to our overall levels of fitness and a reduction in injury levels. Peter acted as the key advisor to the club in this regard, and we wish him well in the future.'

Brukner insisted he was not bitter at the departure, and claimed his work at the club had been done.

'It has been an honour to work at Liverpool Football Club. I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past two years, as can be seen by the reduced injury rate and improved fitness levels.' he said.

'With a world class staff now in place, I feel I have accomplished what I was asked to do by Liverpool in 2010 and the club is in good hands. I wish the Club every success in the future.'
