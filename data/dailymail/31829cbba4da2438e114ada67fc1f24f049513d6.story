Police are investigating the deaths of at least three NHS patients operated on by a cancer surgeon.

Sudip Sarker, 44, had double the death rate of other doctors while working as a consultant general surgeon at Worcester Royal Hospital and the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch.

One in five of his patients had to be readmitted after procedures he carried out, according to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS).

He was referred to the RCS in July 2012 after colleagues raised concerns about his work as  a colon and bowel keyhole  surgery specialist.

But while he was being investigated he was still allowed to continue operating for several months on patients – all unaware of concerns over his performance – until he was eventually suspended in October the same year.

He remains excluded from his post in Worcestershire, which he had held since August 2011, while the General Medical Council has placed restrictions on his licence to practise surgery.

But a hotline for patients and families was opened only last June by Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.

A coroner was due to hold a joint inquest in the deaths of three of his patients, William Jones, 84, Daphne Taylor, 81, and Jean Thomas, 80, who died in 2012 after being operated on by Mr Sarker.

The inquest has now been adjourned pending the investigation by West Mercia Police.

Superintendent Kevin Purcell said the West Mercia force was liaising with key partner agencies after receiving a letter raising concerns in December 2013

It is also feared it may be widened to
 look at ‘a small number’ of other patient deaths. Superintendent Kevin 
Purcell said the investigation began after police received a letter in 
December last year.

He 
said: ‘We were made aware that there were a number of concerns in 
relation to the deaths of patients in 2012 who had been under Mr 
Sarker’s care. We are in the early stages of obtaining the relevant 
information.

‘We cannot be 
specific about numbers at this time but can confirm the deaths of three 
patients whose joint inquest was adjourned in December 2013 form part of
 this inquiry.

‘The families of those people have been informed.’

The
 Trust said it acted as soon as it was aware of a ‘potential problem’ by
 calling in the Royal College of Surgeons, whose report found Mr Sarker 
had double the percentage death rate of doctors carrying out similar 
procedures and triple the number  of readmissions.

The
 Trust has reviewed the records of hundreds of patients undergoing major
 procedures for bowel cancer, some of whom have been recalled  for 
checks.

There is also a separate review under way of all patients in  contact with Mr Sarker, even for minor procedures.

Dozens of patients have made complaints and some families have instructed lawyers to take up  their cases.

Inez
 Brown, a partner at the Medical Accident Group, a medical negligence 
law firm, said: ‘There’s a real danger that the victims who have come 
forward already are just the tip of the iceberg. His work impacted the 
lives of hundreds, if not thousands of families.

‘Spotting
 cancer early is the best way to improve the chances of successful 
treatment, but it’s clear he failed to do this for many of his patients.

‘The news that the police are investigating too suggests that this case goes beyond mere negligence.’

It is understood Mr Sarker remains on his full £85,000-a-year salary.

A
 spokesman for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘We would 
like to reassure patients and their relatives that as soon as it became 
aware there was a potential problem the Trust acted swiftly and 
responsibly to protect its patients.

‘An
 expert multidisciplinary team has reviewed the medical records of all 
his patients who had undergone a major operation. Patients we were 
concerned about were recalled for further assessment.

‘A
 separate review of all patients who had any contact with Mr Sarker is 
being performed by a team of specialist external surgeons.’

An earlier version of this article wrongly said that Sudip Sarker worked for more than a year after concerns were first raised in June 2012. In fact his work was supervised from July and he was excluded by his NHS Trust in October that year.
