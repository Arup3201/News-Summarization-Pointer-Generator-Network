Samsung has come under fire for preloading its handsets with its own apps which can leave customers with just half the amount of advertised storage on flagship  models.

Researchers have found that the so-called 'bloatware' is rarely used by consumers, with many spending just seconds on the apps before deciding to use downloaded apps instead.

Samsung supplies everything from chat to password apps, some pre-installed with the device and the remaining accessible via Google Play and Samsung App stores.

Samsung has come under fire for the amount of 'bloatware' it preloads on its handsets, with claims the apps are rarely used by consumers

Despite Samsung's heavy push in content and apps,  Galaxy S3 and S4 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of apps.

Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers.

As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device.

Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions.

'Despite Samsung’s  heavy push in content and app strategy through Samsung App Store, Media Hub, and in-house apps,  Galaxy S3 and S4 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of on-device usage,' said Strategy Analytics, which analysed the data.

Based on AppOptix March 2014 US panel data on 250-plus Galaxy S3 and S4 users, the total time spent across key Samsung Apps on its flagship devices - Galaxy S3 and S4 – came just under 7 minutes, whereas the same Galaxy user spent 149 minutes amongst three of Google Apps.

'In terms of content discovery and updates, Samsung Hub and Samsung App Store, its primary channel for content downloads, is again lagging behind the segment leader by a wide margin. ,' said the firm.

Recent tests by Which? magazine found that unwanted bloatware and system files still occupy 46 per cent of the phone's internal storage - eight months after intial concerns were raised.

At the opposite end of the scale, Apple's iPhone 5C was the best performing handset, assigning a relatively low 21 per cent of storage to built-in apps and the iOS operating system.

Google apps, by comparison, were a huge hit with Samsung customers

Bonny Joy, Chief, Consumer Telemetry Platforms, said:  “Clearly, Galaxy Sx series have succeeded in creating more engagement by growing the overall pie, but its own content and media strategy is faring low at the moment.

'Galaxy S5 is a step-upgrade from the Galaxy S4, but as far as content and media is concerned, little has changed to draw consumer attention to its latest launch.'

AppOptix data shows a typical Galaxy S3/S4 user spends 64 minutes/month (combined) on Google Play, whereas the same figures for Samsung Hub and Samsung App store are just 0.6 minutes.

However, in terms of overall usage, Galaxy is a top performing device, where Galaxy S3 and S4 users (combined) consume 14% more video and 24% more data above the industry average.

Barry Gilbert, Vice President, said: 'Our data shows that Galaxy S4 users on average have 21 more apps (includes pre-installed and downloaded) than the industry average.

'Obviously, Samsung’s dominant position in the market is an ideal vehicle to drive own-branded content services across its installed base, but Samsung should develop a differentiated set of apps that will resonate with its key user base.'

One of Samsung’s famous apps, ChatOn, which is said to have crossed the 100 million users mark, was used for just 6 seconds per month by the users.

In comparison, users spent over 151 minutes on Instagram and over 11 hours on Facebook per month.

In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB)

Bloatware includes apps and files 
that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they
 are sold to customers.

Which? magazine recently tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets including Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C, Samsung's Galaxy S4, Google's Nexus 5, the Sony Xperia Z1, BlackBerry's Z30, the HTC One Mini and LG's G2.

The
 S4 offers just 8.56GB of available storage, down from 8.8GB in tests carried out in May.

Apple's iPhone 5C has 12.6GB, while the iPhone 5S offers slightly less at 12.2GB.

LG's G2 and HTC One Mini have just short of 11GB of available space each - 10.37GB and 10.44GB respectively.

Some of the preinstalled Samsung files are needed for its new features, such as eye tracking, air gestures and voice commands.

Others, however, are unnecessary or 
unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. To add 
insult to injury, many of these apps and hubs can't be removed.

It's
 likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the iPhone 5S 
running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed 
for the fingerprint scanner.

As technology researcher Jon Barrow explained in a blog post:
 'The reality is every phone has to sacrifice some of its internal 
memory to the operating system - they never live up to the sales talk of
 8,16 or 32GB.

'But 
many manufacturers further stuff their phone with pre-loaded apps, skins
 and bloatware. And no phone has more piping, braiding and frills than 
the Samsung Galaxy S4.'

Apple's iPhone 5C, pictured, has 12.6GB of available space, while the high-end iPhone 5S offers slight less, as 12.2GB. It's likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the 5S running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner

The Samsung findings show the handset has not improved since tests last May - and has actually got worse. 

Samsung responded to criticisms at the time advising people that a solution that to the problem is to buy a MicroSD card if they want extra storage: 'For the Galaxy S4 16 GB model, approximately 6.85 GB occupies the system part of internal memory, which is 1 GB bigger than that of the Galaxy S3, in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers,' explained the Korean firm.

'To offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users, Samsung provides a microSD slot on Galaxy S4 for extension of memory.'

Yet, as Barrow points out, the three phones that topped the latest Which? tests - Apple's iPhone 5C, 5S and Google's Nexus 5 - don't have memory card slots meaning that although they offer more overall, this can't be expanded like the S4.
