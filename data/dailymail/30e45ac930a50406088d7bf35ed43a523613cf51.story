Kieron Dyer has revealed that Newcastle manager Graeme Souness offered to fight both him and Lee Bowyer following their infamous on-field punch-up.

The team-mates were sent off during a 3-0 defeat against Aston Villa at St James’ Park in April, 2005 after coming to blows when Dyer refused to pass to Bowyer.

Angry scenes followed in the dressing-room with captain Alan Shearer delivering a verbal volley to the disgraced pair, while Jean-Alain Boumsong invited them to settle their differences there and then.

But the threat of Souness getting involved put a stop to that.

‘I was sent off first and I was waiting in the tunnel to get some revenge. He came in, and we had two massive masseurs and they just dunked us on their shoulders,’ said the 35-year-old former England international, who retired last year.

‘It was like a cartoon when your feet are dangling off the ground and we were trying to get at each other. We are sat in the changing room and they were in the middle of us.

‘I was thinking how I could get to him. Then we heard the final whistle.

‘Boumsong came in and said, “If you want to fight, fight now”. I was wanting to fight and get the revenge.

‘Then Souness came in and said, “If you want to fight I’ll beat both of you”. Al came in and I never saw him lose it like that – he went mad and called us selfish and a disgrace. He knew we’d have a three-match suspension and miss the FA Cup semi-final that was coming up.’

Dyer says that the argument with Bowyer originated when his team-mate asked why he did not pass to him

Dyer says a lot of swear words were exchanged between the two, including him telling Bowyer he was 's***'

Newcastle were already trailing by three with eight minutes remaining when referee Barry Knight dismissed the duo.

And Dyer, appearing on Sky Sports, reflected: ‘He was like, “Give me the ball” and I was like, “I haven’t given the ball away, what you talking about?”.

‘Five minutes later he came again and I gave it to somebody else. And he said, “You never pass to me.” I said, “The reason I don’t pass to you is because you’re s*** basically”.

‘There were a lot of swear words. And that was it then, you just saw him lose his head.

‘He said, “You what?”. And I said, “You heard me”.

Alan Shearer was furious with the behaviour of his team-mates, leaving them suspended for a cup semi-final

Souness is quoted by Dyer as telling the pair 'If you want to fight I’ll beat both of you' when he arrived

‘As he was walking towards me I just thought he was going to grab me or push me.

‘When he was raining the punches in I thought, “You need to get on the weights because they aren’t hurting”.

‘Secondly, I was thinking, “I can’t believe he’s doing this in front of 50,000 people”.

‘I didn’t know you could get sent off for fighting your own team-mate, so when the red card came out I thought, “What the hell!”.’

Dyer was banned for three matches while Bowyer was hit with a four-game suspension and £200,000 fine having been deemed the aggressor.

Although Dyer joked: ‘I still see him now, we are friends. That’s just the way Lee was. But I still want to beat him up.’

Dyer retired from football last year after finishing his career with Newcastle's local rivals Middlesbrough
