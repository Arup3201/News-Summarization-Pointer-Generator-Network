Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling responded to the NBA's attempt to oust him on Tuesday, arguing that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his racist statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.'

According to the response, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, Sterling says V. Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge and thus the recording was illegal under California law. He also said he could not have 'willfully' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public.

'A jealous rant to a lover never intended to be published cannot offend the NBA rules,' Sterling said in the document, which was first reported by USA Today.

Meanwhile,
 the attorney for Shelly Sterling confirmed that Donald Sterling has 
given her written permission to sell the team. According to a person who
 is in contact with a potential bidder, who spoke to the AP on the 
condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the 
process publicly, the Clippers are seeking binding bids before next 
Tuesday - the day NBA owners are scheduled to meet in New York and vote 
on whether to strip Sterling of the team.

The
 league said in a statement Tuesday that if three-quarters of the 30 
owners voted to sustain the charge, 'the Sterlings' interests in the 
Clippers will be terminated and the team will be sold.'

The
 NBA charged Donald Sterling with damaging the league and its 
merchandising partners, and the league's constitution gave him until the
 end of Tuesday to respond. According to a basketball official familiar 
with the proceedings, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was 
not authorized to discuss Sterling, the NBA has scheduled a call of its 
executive committee for Wednesday afternoon.

Shelly
 Sterling submitted her own separate response to the NBA's charges 
Tuesday that included a 'vigorous defense of the attempt by the NBA to 
blame her,' according to a person with knowledge of the proceedings. The
 individual wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the response.

In
 his response, Donald Sterling says that next week's hearing cannot be 
fair because the owners have already made up their minds, quoting 10 
teams who commented on Twitter or elsewhere that they supported the 
seizure of the team. An AP survey on the day Commissioner Adam Silver 
announced Sterling's lifetime ban found that half of the teams supported
 it and no owner was against it.

'These
 proceedings will be a spectacle meant to mollify the popular opinion, 
not a fair and impartial hearing: the outcome of these proceedings 
became a foregone conclusion weeks ago,' the response states.

The
 response also notes the disparity between his lifetime ban and $2.5 
million fine and previous NBA punishments, including the $100,000 fine 
levied on Kobe Bryant when he was caught referring to a referee by a 
homosexual slur, and the 72-game suspension of Ron Artest for punching a
 fan.

The NBA said Sterling
 is in violation because his racist comments were harmful to the league 
and its business partners, including the players. Sterling's response 
argues that because his comments came in the privacy of his girlfriend's
 living room he cannot be considered 'taking a position' that damaged 
the NBA, as required under the league constitution.

'Mr.
 Sterling was not `conducting' the `sport of professional basketball' 
when he was arguing with Ms. Stiviano in her living room,' the response 
says. 'Not even the Commissioner alleges that Mr. Sterling intended to 
harm the NBA with his comment. Nor could he. This was an argument 
between a jealous man and the woman he loved that should never have left
 the privacy of his living room.'

Sterling
 also noted his history of supporting racial diversity, including five 
black head coaches and a black general manager, Elgin Baylor, who held 
the job for 22 years. Baylor eventually unsuccessfully sued Sterling, 
accusing him of racist behavior. It also notes that he was due to 
receive his second lifetime achievement award from the NAACP before the 
recording of his comments was leaked.

The
 response claims that it would cost Sterling $300 million to $500 
million in capital gains taxes if he is forced to sell now rather than 
pass the team to his heirs.
