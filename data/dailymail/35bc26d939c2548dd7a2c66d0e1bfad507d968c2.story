'I made a mistake': British scientist James Lovelock has admitted his previous claims about the deadly impact of climate change were too 'alarmist'

Environmental scientist James Lovelock, renowned for his terrifying predictions of climate change's deadly impact on the planet, has gone back on his previous claims, admitting they were 'alarmist'.

The 92-year-old Briton, who also developed the Gaia theory of the Earth as a single organism, has said climate change is still happening - just not as quickly as he once warned.

He added that other environmental commentators, such as former vice president Al Gore, are also guilty of exaggerating their arguments.

The admission comes as a devastating blow to proponents of climate change who regard Lovelock as a powerful figurehead.

Five years ago, he had claimed: 'Before this century is over billions of 
us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in
the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable.'

But in an interview with msnbc.com, he admitted: 'I made a mistake.'

He said: 'The problem is we don’t know what the climate is doing,' he told  'We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear cut, but it hasn’t happened.

'The climate is doing its usual 
tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to 
be halfway toward a frying world.

'[The
temperature] has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been 
rising - carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that.'

After two books - Revenge of Gaia: Why the Earth Is 
Fighting Back and How We Can Still Save Humanity, and The Vanishing 
Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can - he is writing a third.

Drastic: Lovelock had previously claimed London would be threatened by rising sea levels by 2040

Claims: While Lovelock would not go back on anything he said in his first book, published in 1979 (left), he admitted he should have exercised more caution in his second, in 2009 (right). He is writing a third

It will not go back on climate change, he said, but will admit he had been 'extrapolating too far'. It will suggest how people can change their habits to co-ordinate with the Earth's natural systems.

Lovelock
said he is not the only one who got it wrong, suggesting other 
environmental commentators, such as Al Gore and Tim Flannery, also 
thought the impact would have been seen sooner.

Now he admits: 'We will have global warming, but it’s been deferred a bit.'

A long-time advocate of nuclear power, he suggested we should cut back on burning fossil fuels.

James Lovelock developed the Gaia theory in the 1960s while working with NASA.

It claims that all of the organic 
and inorganic components of Earth are closely integrated to form a 
single and self-regulating system.

This living system has automatically
controlled global temperature, atmospheric content, oxygen, ocean 
salinity, and other factors.

In summary, it posits 'life maintains conditions suitable for its own survival'.

The independent scientist, who is based 
in south west England and has conducted research at Yale and Harvard 
universities, has been a respected member of the academic 
community for decades.

He discovered the presence of harmful chemicals - CFCs - in the atmosphere in the 1960s.

In 2007, Time magazine named him as one 13 leaders and visionaries in an article on Heroes of the Environment.

In 1990, he became a CBE, presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II, and in 2003, she awarded him a Companion of Honour for his achievements in science.

Peter
Stott, head of climate monitoring at the U.K.’s Met Office Hadley Centre, told msnbc.com he agreed Lovelock 
had been too alarmist.

But he added that Lovelock has 'had a lot of good ideas and interesting thoughts'.

Too dramatic: Lovelock added that other environmental commentators, including Tim Flannery (left) and Al Gore (right) had also overstated the impact of climate change in their books

Respect: In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II awards Lovelock a Companion of Honour for his achievements in science

'I like the fact he’s provocative and provokes people to think about these things,' Stott said.

The world’s average temperature has risen by around 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

By 2100, it will rise by another 2 to 11.5 degrees, it predicts.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration added that data collected by satellites and sensors 'continue to show that the average global surface temperature is rising'.

It added that extreme weather - such as heat waves and heavy rain - were becoming more frequent and that there had been decreases in snow and glaciers.

'All 11 years of the 21st century so far rank among the 13 warmest in the 132-year period of record. Only one year during the 20th century, 1998, was warmer than 2011,' it said.
