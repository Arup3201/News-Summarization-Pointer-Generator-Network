A Saudi Arabian air force sergeant has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for kidnapping and brutally sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy at a Las Vegas Strip hotel two years ago.

Mazen Alotaibi, 25 will carry out his sentence at Nevada state prison after a judge spared him additional time for lewdness, kidnapping and other convictions during sentencing on Wednesday.

But the Saudi's horrific assault on the teenager - which included forced oral and anal sex - left the victim's mother sobbing loudly in court as she told the judge her son's life had been 'ruined.'

Crime scene: Police said Alotaibi was staying at Circus Circus hotel on the Strip while on holiday when he sexually assaulted the teenager inside his sixth-floor room

A jury found Alotaibi guilty in October 2013 of having sex with the boy at the Circus-Circus hotel after a night of drinking cognac at a strip club on New Year's Eve 2012.

His lawyer argued that the boy consented to sex for marijuana, and Alotaibi was too intoxicated to know he was committing a crime.

But under Nevada state law, a child under the age of 16 cannot give sexual consent.

The boy, who is now aged 15, testified that he was waiting to go to breakfast with a friend when he approached Alotaibi and other men early on December 31 at the Circus Circus hotel.

He said he had smelled marijuana on their clothes and wanted some too.

However, the jury heard that the other men who were lounging and smoking in the room shooed the boy away after learning that he was 13.

But Alotaibi followed the boy, out of the room, smoked marijuana with him outside the hotel, and asked the boy for sex, according to the boy's account.

Alotaibi was later seen on elevator surveillance video leaning down and apparently kissing the boy's neck on their way back to the hotel room. 

The boy is seen running back to the elevator about 30 minutes later. 

The boy testified that in the hotel room bathroom, Alotaibi blocked the door, offered him $150 and then doubled the amount, and forced him into oral and anal sex.

A man who was traveling with Alotaibi testified that he knocked several times on the locked bathroom door while Alotaibi and the boy were inside, but they didn't come out.

It was alleged that Alotaibi wanted sex and wouldn't take no for an answer.

The boy testified that he was 'freaked out' and didn't know how to escape when Alotaibi made sexual advances toward him before raping him.

'It felt like I was trapped in a corner,' the boy said about the encounter at Circus Circus, his voice growing quiet.

'I was freaked out and I wanted to leave, but I didn't know what to do.'

Police said that Alotaibi first denied the allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to 
have sex with him for money.

He told investigators 
that he had made the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of 
seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him.  

The boy has not been publicly named because of his age and the nature of the case. 

Alotaibi was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio,Texas, and had an identification card from the Saudi Arabian military. 

Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic law, and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment.

Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liquor could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.
