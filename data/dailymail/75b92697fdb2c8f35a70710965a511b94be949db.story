Australia's medal tally has been extended with two gold, three silvers and one bronze added overnight in Glasgow.

Laura Coles won in a gold-medal shoot-out against Elena Allen, from Wales, in the women's skeet shooting event.

Jack Bobridge then won gold in the 4000m individual pursuit, beating compatriot Alex Edmondson, who claimed silver in an all-Australian final.

More success on the cycling track also saw Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett take home silver in the men's 1000m para-cycling, just falling short of the home side by 0.15 seconds.

Edmondson's win comes off her silver medal on Friday morning in the 3000m individual pursuit while compatriot Amy Cure won bronze. England's Joanna Rowsell took gold

Another silver came from Annette Edmondson - Alex's sister - who lost out to England's Joanna Roswell, in the women's 3000m individual pursuit.

Meanwhile Edmondson's team mate Amy Cure took out third place in the same event.

These second-day triumphs come after a flying start for Australia's Commonwealth Games campaign, winning five gold medals on the first day of action.

Flagbearer Anna Meares kicked off the medal spree, claiming gold in the women's 500m time trial in the velodrome.

Meares' teammate in Glasgow, Stephanie Morton, won the silver in the same event on a great night for Australia.

The men's cycling team then took gold in the 4000m team pursuit while Bradie O'Connor (sprint tandem) and the team sprint foursome both won bronze.

In the pool, Australia's swimmers started well with three gold medals. The 4x100m freestyle relay team consisting of Emma McKeon, Melanie Schlanger and sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell won gold, taking out Australian swimming's first world record since 2009 in the process.

The world record is particularly impressive when you consider the time they beat was set by the Dutch in 2009, who were wearing the now banned 'super suits'.

Earlier in the evening Emma McKeon got the job done without her teammates, winning gold in the 200m freestyle.

The final Aussie gold came from 16-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Rowan Crothers, who won the men’s para 100m freestyle, breaking his own world record in the process.

Anna Meares triumph in the velodrome means she has now won five gold medals in track cycling at the Commonwealth Games, equaling the record haul by compatriot Bradley McGee.

It is a third successive victory in the event for Meares, who also equals Kathy Watt's Australia women's cycling record of seven Commonwealth Games medals and has become the first rider to win a medal at four Games.

Meares has the chance to beat Watt's record on Friday when she will compete in the women's sprint final.

Australia is currently coming second in the Commonwealth Games medal tally with six gold, five silver and eight bronze, a total of 19 medals.

This comes after the nation's three silver medals were won by Stephanie Morton in the 500m track cycling, Matthew Cowdrey in the para-sport 100m Freestyle  and David Mckeon in the 400m Freestyle on the first day of the games.

While the Australian teams in two cycling events, the women's para-sport Sprint B Tandem and the men's team sprint, took home bronze along with Chloe Rayner and Amy Meyer taking home third in the under-48kg judo events, and Brenden Hall, Bronte Barratt and Keryn Mcmaster winning bronze in their swimming events.

500m England is in the lead with 17 medals – six gold, seven silver and four bronze.
