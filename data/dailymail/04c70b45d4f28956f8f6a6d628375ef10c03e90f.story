President Barack Obama said Monday that installing a new prime minister in Iraq will be 'an important step toward forming a new government that can unite' the hodgepodge of ethnic and religious sects that dominate life in the Middle Eastern country.

Between a beach afternoon 
on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard and a Democratic Party 
fundraiser 15 miles away in the town of Tisbury, Obama's said in a four-minute speech that 'the only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come together and form an inclusive government -- one that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis.'

Mobilizing new kinds of U.S. support for Iraq, he claimed, standing in a small clearing flanked by trees, 'will be easier once that new government is in place.'

An already incendiary situation in Baghdad threatened to reach new levels of tension Monday, when Iraqi President Fuad Masum dismissed Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and elevated his deputy parliament speaker Haider al-Ibadi to replace him.

Obama said he had personally called al-Ibadi to offer his support.

The White House said earlier in the day 
that Vice President Joe Biden spoke with both Masum and al-Ibadi.

According to a report from the White House Press Office, Biden reminded Masum
of 'President Obama's repeated calls for the timely creation of a 
new, more inclusive government that will be able to address the 
legitimate concerns of all Iraqis.

Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville said Monday that U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft have executed 15 
targeted airstrikes in and around 
the Kurdish territorial capital of Erbil since Saturday morning.

The U.S. and Britain have collaborated, he added, to deliver 14 humanitarian airdrops of relief supplies to Kurdish Yazidis, a minority religious sect in Iraqi Kurdistan.

'I
 want to thank in particular the United Kingdom, France, and other 
countries working with us to provide much needed assistance to the Iraqi
 people,' Obama said Monday.

'And,
 meanwhile, our aircraft remain positioned to strike any terrorist 
forces around the mountain who threaten the safety of these families.'

Obama
 justified his airstrikes Friday on humanitarian grounds, saying in a 
press conference that he aimed to stop a Yazidi genocide.

An estimated 40,000 of them took refuge last week
 on a mountain, with no food or water, as ISIS Islamists slashed and 
killed their way through northwestern Iraq.

The
 Associated Press reported that American warplanes struck a convoy of 
ISIS militants headed in the direction of Kurdish 'Peshmerga' soldiers on Monday. 
The Kurds successfully recaptured two towns over the weekend, marking 
their first victories after a seemingly endless retreat.

Al-Maliki's Shiite coalition government 
coasted to victory in April elections, but that was before the 
self-styled 'Islamic State in Iraq and Syria' (ISIS) terrorist militias 
launched a devastating Islamist jihad offensive and claimed vast parts 
of Iraq's territories.

Amid cries about a government coup, al-Maliki's backers danced in the streets and chanted their support.

The two-term prime minister had said he would seek a third term despite calls for his ouster from Kurds, Sunnis and even his fellow Shiites. He insisted Monday that he should remain since his party still controls a parliamentary majority.

Masum, like Obama, favors a broader coalition government can unite his country against ISIS, which has run a deadly campaign of terror in the nation's north, and moved perilously close to Baghdad.

In an address televised in Iraq, Syria and Iran, he set a 30-day deadline for al-Ibadi to form a new government coalition and present it for parliament's approval.

House Speaker John Boehner charged an hour before Obama's speech that he was unprepared – after more than 5-1/2 years in office – to face the challenges of Iraq's re-emergence as a terror hotbed.

'The crisis in Iraq caught the Obama administration completely off guard,' Boehner said in a statement. 'With the Middle East in chaos, the president's campaign line about terrorists being "on the run" seems like wishful thinking at best.'

'The Obama administration's lack of engagement over the last few years' in Iraq, he claimed, 'created an opening for Islamic radicals to take control of large swaths of the country.'

The normally left-leaning Washington Post editorial board conceded on Sunday that 'Mr. Obama lacks a plausible plan for addressing the larger threat posed by the Islamic State.'

At the same
 time, Obama's move to authorize limited airstrikes in Iraq's northern 
regions is being credited for helping Kurdish 'Peshmerga' forces defend 
Erbil, the capital of their autonomous region.

Fire from the skies: ISIS militants have seen strategic positions destroyed or cut off by missile strikes from fighter jets since Saturday morning

Since declaring itself to be an Islamic caliphate on June 10, ISIS has fought with Syria's army, tribal groups from Sunni regions of Iraq, and Peshmerga militias in Iraqi Kurdistan.

ISIS militants have also been on the march in Syria, crushing resistance and executing 25 of their opponents – including two by execution – according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Republican lawmakers griped on Sunday political talk shows yesterday, claiming that Obama's cautious approach to pinprick bombing strikes would allow ISIS to grow to the point where it endangers American interests.

'If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS ... they are coming here,' South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News Sunday. 'And if we do get attacked, then he will have committed a blunder for the ages.'

'What a weak leader,' New York Republican Rep. Peter King carped on NBC's show Meet the Press.

'We're gonna attack this, but we're not gonna do this, we're not gonna do that. Can you imagine Winston Churchill or Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman [acting like that]?'
