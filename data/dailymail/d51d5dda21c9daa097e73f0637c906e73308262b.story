The FBI has offered a $20,000 reward for information that helps them find a 2-year-old girl who disappeared 10 days ago and is believed to have been kidnapped.

Myra Lewis vanished on March 1 after playing with her sister outside the family's Camden, Mississippi home.

Her mother Ericka Lewis was arrested last week for a probation violation because police found that she was in possession of a firearm.

Missing: Myra Lewis, 2, disappeared after playing with her sister outside the family home on Saturday March 1

Mitigating factors: An Amber Alert was issued and police searched the surrounding area in case she wandered off but her family believes that she has been kidnapped

The arrest is reportedly being considered as unrelated to her daughter's disappearance, but Ericka's mother says that the arrest is serving as an unnecessary distraction.

'They should have waited because that even took their mind off Myra for a moment,' Myra's grandmother Martha Samders said.

'They can pressure Erica, but she'll never give in. She'll never give in because she didn't do anything.'

The missing girl's father Gregory Lewis told local station WJTV that both he and his wife have taken polygraph tests as well as other members of their family.

Not connected: Myra's mother Ericka Lewis has a previous felony conviction, the subject of which has not been revealed, but because police found guns in her home during the investigation, she was arrested for parole violation

Doing their part: Ericka's husband said that they have both taken polygraph tests in connection to Myra's disappearance and police confirmed that the relatives have been helpful and cooperative

Madison County sheriff Randy Tucker said that the relatives have been fully cooperative and have turned over their SUV for inspection as well as a number of undisclosed items from their home.

'At far as what was in the bags, obviously we'll start where the child was last seen and we have evidence response folks who are going to that location and recovering evidence and all of this is a collective effort to discover where little Myra is,' FBI Special Agent Dan McMullen told CBS.

'I'm not going to talk about anything specific with regard to the investigation.'

Sheriff Tucker did tell WJTV that one of the reasons why the SUV is being checked out is in case the toddler was run over by the vehicle.

Remaining hopeful: Police have told parents Gregory (left) and Ericka Lewis (right) that they believe their daughter is still alive even though temperatures have dropped down to below freezing at night

Myra disappeared between 10.30am and 11am on Saturday March 1 but the family did not report it to authorities until about 4pm because they said they did an initial search themselves. An Amber Alert was issued on Sunday March 2.

'Since her disappearance was reported, multiple state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a massive, collaborative search effort,' the Jackson, Mississippi FBI office said in a statement.

'Significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation, including extensive ground and air searches, and utilization of specially trained search teams.'

What happened? Myra, right, was playing with her sister, left, when she vanished but police have not said anything about what the sister did or didn't see

Local and federal authorities have searched 4-square-miles surrounding the family's home with the help of 300 officers and volunteers as well as search dogs.

In spite of the fact that she has been missing for 10 days at this point, they still remain confident that she is alive, citing a kidnapping as the most likely scenario.

'We fully expect a positive outcome,' Sheriff Tucker said.

'We need to get Myra home, and again we want to stress to everyone we need your help, the family needs your help and we appreciate your calls.'
