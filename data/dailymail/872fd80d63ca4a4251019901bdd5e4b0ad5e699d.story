Cara Delevigne adores them, Pixie Lott seems to have a wardrobe full of them and Cressida Bonas never seems to take hers off.

But it's not the latest Givenchy must-have that has send the A-list scurrying to the shops. Instead, it's the retro scrunchie that has become the talk of Tinseltown.

Despite being as dated as the shoulder pad and the leg warmer, the 80s classic, as the Observer points out, has been enthusiastically embraced by stars hoping to show off their edgy side.

Retro: Pixie Lott and Selena Gomez have both been spotted out and about with their hair in a scrunchie

Favourite: Prince Harry's girl Cressida Bonas is rarely seen without a scrunchie perched atop her blonde locks

What's more, it's not just the starry set who have declared a penchant for the scrunchie - the frilly hairpiece has been spotted all over the catwalk too.

In September, it appeared repeatedly on the runway, with Vivienne Westwood, Louis Vuitton and Missoni all among those embracing the look.

So what's behind the scrunchie revival? Opinion is split, with some pinning it on the Olympics effect while others cite the 1980s redux that has dominated the high street in recent years.

'The scrunchie is super 1980s and slightly trashy, and bordered on the naff in the early 1990s,' hairdresser Luke Hersheson told the Observer.

'But the long ones with wire and velvet that you can make bows out of are great.'

Original: Madonna shows how to work a scrunchie in her 1985 film, Desperately Seeking Susan

Avoiding the trend: Former scrunchie fan Madonna was last seen in one in 2009 - unlike Heather Mills

Another fan is milliner Charlie Le Mindu who counts Lady Gaga among devotees of his sculptural creations.

'I like the scrunchie look, but it's better for older women, or underground drag queens,' he explains.

He adds: 'I like them if there are lots of them, used to create modern forms, not just something to tie your hair back.'

But despite approval from Le Mindu and Hersheson, one group who won't be embracing the look is the team at fashion glossy, Harper's Bazaar.

Last month, the title included an article that listed five reasons to hate the scrunchie, while calling it an 'unsophisticated accessory' and declaring that it was a fad they would be sitting out.

Even Madonna, the woman who elevated scrunchie-sporting to a fine art during her Desperately Seeking Susan days doesn't appear thrilled about the renaissance of the frilly hairband, and is now rarely seen in them.

So will you dare to brave the scrunchie? It seems that this is one hair trend that could prove just as divisive as it did the first time round.
