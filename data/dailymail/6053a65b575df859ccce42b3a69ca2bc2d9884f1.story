Nigella Lawson was a bit in the bain-marie last week for saying that French food is all about fancy sauces and plate decoration, and that she far ­prefers Italian food.

This was perfectly reasonable, I thought. This is not Russia, and she should be able to voice a preference without being put in prison.

I'm a huge fan of Nigella, not because I ever cook any of her recipes – I have a phobia about ingredients, and do not possess an oven, nor much like food – but because she is so breath­takingly beautiful.

Breathtaking: 'She looks Italian with a teeny waist and hair colour of liquorice'

I once had lunch with her, and it was like being seated opposite a great Hollywood star, like Sophia Loren in her prime, or Gina Lollobrigida.

She looks Italian, with a teeny waist and hair the colour of ­liquorice, so why shouldn't she cook Italian? She was nice, too, grabbing my hand and exclaiming that neither of us was wearing a huge diamond engagement ring (I was married then). 'I hate women who show off,' she said.

And now along comes a French chef, Jean-Christophe Novelli, a man who has a greasy slick of black hair that falls into his eyes, like an apron-clad Shakin' Stevens.

He said of the goddess Nigella and her favouring Italian food: 'Having witnessed her for the last 30 years of my life, it's rather amazing for someone who has looked well over 60 for more than two-thirds of her life from behind, and who has scavenged a big part of her starting life on mostly amazing basic French cooking.

Greasy: 'How dare' Jean-Christophe Novelli say Nigella looks old

'She is not even capable of supporting her own native cuisine.'

Nigella looks 60 years old! From behind! This from a man who might have Italian roots, but comes from a country that drowns wild birds in alcohol, then eats them, bones and all. A country where people eat horse, and foal stew, and foie gras.

I once sent a young female food writer to interview Novelli when he was running the restaurant at a country house hotel, and he was rude and mono­syllabic.

He raises money for the British Heart Foundation (and also charges £695 and upwards for his masterclasses where you have your photo taken with him), but have you seen his recipes? Baked Vacherin cheese, wrapped in ham.

Crispy ham and cheese pork chops, fried in a knob of butter.Why not use the sebum from your dreadful bonce to fry a wild hare's heart?

He is stupid, too. On his website, he spells Eton Mess with an 'a', as in Eaton, and uses brands that sponsor him, such as Carte D'Or ice cream.

How dare you say our Nigella looks old from the rear, when she doesn't remotely look her age from any angle? Women in Paris, in their fur pelts and with their hoisted faces, emaciated bodies and lack of humour, look ancient. Nigella is both creamy and dreamy.

I hate male chefs, all of them. Isn't Paul Hollywood arrogant on The Great British Bake Off, while Mary Berry is so encouraging, sweet as an English strawberry?

Gordon Ramsay once cooked me dinner: baked little gem hearts. Translated, that means hot lettuce. Seriously. Even I can do better than that.

He once made marks on my virgin kitchen table, too, cutting pasta shapes. 'What are you!' I yelled. 'A toddler? Use a chopping board! Do you scribble on walls as well?'

Jamie Oliver invited me to lunch, then served me an entire meal made of truffles. Everything was foamy. Who wants that?

The worst meal I ever ate was cooked by Marco Pierre White – he of the dead shark's eyes. When I told him I don't eat meat he sent out a plate of asparagus, with nothing on top.

Female chefs are more open to new ideas, to people who are altogether less carnivorous than they are. I sat next to Lorraine Pascale last week – we were both in a studio having our make-up done – and I told her I don't own an oven. 'What on earth do you eat?' she said, eyebrows in her ironed hair.

'I'm sad that there is no woman in the final of The Great British Bake Off'

'Um, muesli with rice milk. Anything cold, like an avocado.' 'I think we should all eat less meat,' she said gravely.

Male chefs regard women who dare to have flesh on their bones as a sign of matronhood, of letting the side down, of not being attractive enough. But Nigella is bigger than Jean-Christophe in every way: he is merely jealous.

I'm sad that there is no woman in the final of The Great British Bake Off, which airs on Tuesday. It's the women of this country who have to cook, day in, day out, without plaudits.

Men merely make a mess, then expect to be praised like puppies who have used a puppy training pad.
