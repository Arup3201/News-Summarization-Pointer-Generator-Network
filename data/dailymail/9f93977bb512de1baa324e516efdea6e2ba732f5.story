Firefighters were working through the night to tackle a massive blaze at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London.

Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles around the Grade II listed building after the fire began at just after 4.15pm today. Witnesses claimed people watched on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed.  

London Fire Brigade had twelve engines and more than 80 firefighters battling the fire at the height of the inferno but a spokesman said crews were making 'steady progress' to get the blaze under control.

A massive blaze has broken out at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London at just after 4.15pm, which has damaged the roof of the building

Flames had engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding 

'We have got the fire surrounded,' he added. 'Good progress is being made, salvage operations and fire investigations are now underway.

'We anticipate we'll be there for the rest of the night.' 

By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters as they managed to get the fire under control.

It is estimated that at least a third of the building has been badly damaged with some parts, such as the tower, completely destroyed. 

An ambulance service spokesman said crews had treated a woman for smoke inhalation at the scene but she had not required hospital treatment.

So far, the cause of the fire is unknown.

Nicholas Bennett, a magistrate at nearby Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court, said earlier this afternoon that black smoke had been 'everywhere, engulfing the  area.' 

Rumours that the nearby Clapham Junction railway station had been evacuated were confirmed false by Network Rail but Lavender Hill is closed in both directions as the fire services continued to fight the blaze. 

Battersea Arts Centre confirmed everyone had escaped the building and that there would be no performances for the next two evenings.

A spokesman for the theatre tweeted just after the start of the blaze: ''There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control.

'We will not be running any performances this evening and we have also cancelled the performance of Missing tomorrow evening.
