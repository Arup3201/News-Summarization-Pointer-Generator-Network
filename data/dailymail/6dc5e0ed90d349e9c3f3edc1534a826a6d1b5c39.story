Ryan Leo was hit and killed by a car in Hurstville in Sydney's south on Monday

The Sydney mother of a six-year-old boy killed after being hit car has made an emotional tribute to her son.

'In heaven there is no traffic, mummy loves you forever,' Zhen Zhen posted online, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Ryan Leo was on his way to his martial arts class when he was hit by an oncoming car on Durham St, Hustville, in Sydney's south on Monday afternoon.

Paramedics were called to the scene about 4.40pm and Ryan died in St George Hospital two hours later after suffering ­severe head and chest injuries.

He was with his aunt when he broke free from her and took about 'three steps on to the road' a police spokesman said.

The Year 1 Oatley Public School student was flung metres into the air when he was struck by the car - just outside the the Boy Scout Club where he attended his tae kwon do classes, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The female driver stopped after the crash underwent mandatory testing.

Speed and alcohol were not factors in the accident, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Employees from nearby businesses rushed to the accident scene where they tried to revive the young boy, who was still in the middle of the road.

Ryan's tae kwon do headmaster Incheol Yoo said the road where the young boy was killed was 'dangerous' and that speeding was often an issue.

In May he petitioned Hurstville City Council about the safety risks and later that month was advised by the council that the matter had been referred for investigation to the council's senior traffic engineer.

The council has called the death a 'tragic accident' but will not be commenting further until a report for the coroner was completed.

'It should be noted that council received a petition in mid-May 2014 and council officers have prepared a report relating to parking issues on this street for council to consider at its meeting on August 6.'

Teaching at the Durham St Scout hall for 24 years, Mr Yoo said a recent residential development nearby had created havoc for people trying to find a spot to park their cars.

Mr Yoo said he was struggling to come to terms with the shock death. 'He (Ryan) was a good boy, a lovely boy. It's very sad,' he said of his pupil.

The headmaster said the young boy's parents recently had another child and this might have been the reason why his aunt drove him to class.

Mr Yoo did not see the accident because he was teaching when it happened, but said one of his teenage students did but said the martial arts school looked after its students.

Ryan started going to the tae kwon do school last February and already had a yellow belt.

The tragic accident happened in front of Hassan Hage’s dry cleaning business and dry cleaner Wafa Hage said people from surrounding businesses rushed to the scene where they tried frantically to revive the boy as his aunt cried hysterically.

'I opened the door and saw the little boy on the ground. I hugged (the boy's aunt) and gave her some water but she was screaming,' Mrs Hage said.

Mrs Hage's husband, Hassan, was among those who ran to help, but said Ryan was not breathing and was bleeding from the nose, mouth and ears.

Mr Hassan said Concept Funerals employees also ran from their building and tried to revive the young boy.

Despite the tragedy, Mr Hage said a similar accident would certainly happen again if road safety in the area was not improved.

'I'm worried it will happen again unless they do something. They need a crossing, anything.'

Traffic and Highway Patrol Command’s Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said the tragedy was heartbreaking.

'The impact of a crash on everyone who is linked to it resonates well after headlines have faded,' he said.

'After a series of similar events earlier in the year, I would hope anyone with children in their lives would use this an opportunity to talk about road safety with them.'

Acting Assistant Commissioner Smith urged parents and caretakers to take extra precautions when near vehicles.

'As a parent, I would plead with everyone that if they are with young children near a roadway always keep holding their hand,' he said.

'To drivers, particularly if you are passing residential areas, do be mindful children may be about.'

Oatley Primary School headmaster described Ryan as a well-loved student who will be missed in a letter sent to parents notifying of the death, reported The Daily Telegraph.

'Ryan was a bright, outgoing and delightful student of our school. He loved to know that he was pleasing other students and teachers,' the letter states.

'We will remember his passion for singing and his love for martial arts.'

The letter continues by stating that the primary school is supporting Ryan's family and respecting their wishes.

Support for parents and children was also offered by the school.
