Commando Ashley Hicks, 25, slipped 100ft down a gorge as he tried to reach a safe point while being pursued by other soldiers

A Royal Marine died during a gruelling Special Forces selection exercise when he fell into a mountain gorge not shown on the map he was given by commanders, an inquest heard.

Commando Ashley Hicks, 25, slipped down a 100ft drop as he tried to reach a safe point while ‘escaping’ from other soldiers as part of the night-time training mission.

He had just warned his colleagues ‘mind your footing’ as they clambered over the rocks.

But seconds later, he plummeted into Maentwrog Gorge in Snowdonia, North Wales, and fell to his death. The drop was not shown on their scale map of the area.

Marine Hicks, of Solihull, near Birmingham, was killed while taking part in exercises to join an elite Special Forces unit believed to be the SAS.

He was part of a team climbing in the notoriously inhospitable area to test their ‘ability to adapt and survive’ in extreme conditions.

They were practising the skills they had been taught to survive in the wild an escape from an enemy force.

Marine Hicks volunteered to lead a team through the mountainous region while attempting to ‘evade capture’ from other soldiers.

An inquest heard how they had limited equipment for the night time drill including a map with ‘little detail’ of the area.

The soldiers looked at the terrain on Google Earth but the gorge was identified as a small riverbed rather than a 31-metre drop.

North Wales Coroners Court heard how the soldiers decided to take a more 'direct route' to their safe point to try and avoid detection.

Marine Hicks stepped over a dry stone wall telling his colleagues: ‘It's getting steep here, so mind your footing’.

But just seconds later they heard him slip and fall down a steep gorge.

An emergency beacon was set off to highlight their position, while two of the servicemen hurried to tend to their fallen comrade.

When they reached him he was drifting in and out of consciousness and had a weak pulse, a few minutes later he stopped breathing.

The soldiers carried out CPR on Ashley until a rescue helicopter arrived and he was rushed to hospital

His comrades carried out CPR on him until a rescue helicopter arrived and he was rushed to Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, North Wales, where he died.

One of the troops, who cannot be named, described the level of risk on the exercise, in October 2012, as ‘acceptable’.

But another said the hazardous area would have been placed ‘out of bounds’ had they known about the steep-sided gorge.

Marine Hicks, of 40 Commando, as an ‘exceptionally capable, highly motivated individual’.

Last year three Territorial Army soldiers died in a gruelling SAS selection exercise on the hottest day of the year. They collapse with heat exhaustion while taking part in the notorious ‘Fan Dance’ march in the Brecon Beacons mountain range.

The hearing in Caernarfon continues.
