Reading booked an FA Cup semi-final date against Arsenal on Monday night - but their celebrations were marred by an allegation of racist abuse towards winger Garath McCleary.

The Royals cruised to Wembley with a 3-0 win, ending Bradford's heroic run in the competition.

It will be Reading's first FA Cup semi-final in 88 years, but the achievement was overshadowed by suggestions McCleary, a Jamaica international, was racially abused by a Bradford supporter.

The incident occurred five minuted before half-time when McCleary tried to retrieve the ball from the Bradford end.

McCleary, who scored the second goal, was shocked by something a fan said to him; the Royals winger immediately informed the referee's assistant, who subsequently told fourth official Andre Marriner.

Marriner relayed the information to a senior Reading security chief, who is understood to have promptly ensured the fan in question was ejected from the stadium. The supporter was then arrested.

In confirming the incident, a Reading statement read: 'An incident was reported to the match officials just before half time, who in turn told Reading staff. A man was then arrested and ejected during the half-time interval.'

Royals manager Steve Clarke admitted after the game he was aware of an incident involving McCleary.

The FA will wait for referee Mike Jones' report before deciding on what course of action to take, if any, this morning.

Likewise, the end of the encounter was soured by a mass pitch invasion from elated home supporters. And the invasion sparked angry scenes between both sets of supporters as stewards prevented furious Bradford fans from entering the pitch to confront jubilant Reading supporters.

Supporters proceeded to throw missiles, including bottle of waters, on to the pitch. Earlier, a pitch invader goaded travelling supporters which caused Bradford fans to throw more missiles onto the pitch.

Reading keeper Adam Federici was seen handing a coin over to a steward guarding Bradford fans.

On his side's comfortable win, Reading manager Steve Clarke said: 'I'm pleased for the players because it's been a difficult season.

'We got to the Arsenal game with hope and belief, when we get to the day we will be quite excited.

'But we won't think about it yet, if you think it will be difficult to forget about the semi-final then you don't know me. We've got important league games before then and that's out focus.'

Bradford manager Phil Parkinson, whose side beat Chelsea and Sunderland en route to the quarter-final, added: 'We've got to be immensely proud of what we achieved, but this is tough to take. But we've got to move on. We've got so many great memories that we can take into the rest of this season for years to come.

'We came up against a team that play really well. When you have an off day against a higher level opponent you get punished.'
