A clip of the stunt, which took place in Maitland NSW, shows the rider Joel Brown gaining momentum before he mounts a ramp and flips over the plane in slow motion.

Brown says there are plans to take the stunt to international audiences, and that there are some features they want to add to the stunt that they cannot reveal

Brown is the current Australian freestyle motocross champion, and has been riding professionally for five years, however he told Daily Mail Australia this was his 'first real stunt'.

'I'm definitely looking to pursue more in the future,' he said.

He explained the the safety measures that were taken.

'I had to check how the wind off the plane would effect me while jumping over the top. I needed to have my speeds right and wouldn't fall short of the down ramp .

'Paul (the pilot) also had test flights to make sure he could stay as low as possible. In the end of the day though, there's only so much safety you have with a stunt like this.'

'As the day got closer the nerves started to affect me. It's not just the jump its also your machine and if something happened on the ramp where my bike suffered an engine failure. As a rider we tend not to think about these things.'

The 28-year-old says there are now plans to take the stunt to the next level. 'We've had have had interest from international air shows, and we're planning to take it on a national tour.

'There are a few things we want to add to the stunt but I don't want to give that up just yet.'

Brown said that there is only so much safety you can have with a stunt like this, and that he was nervous on the day of the stunt

He says the video has been gaining momentum online: 'My Facebook athlete page has had an influx of followers, and I know Aussie Adrenaline is also seeing a lot of activity with people sharing the stunt. 

'For all of us involved it has been an amazing reaction.'

Brown said he he had also considered about putting these skills into another industry.

'Robbie Maddison,an Australian motorbike stunt rider, worked as a stunt double on the latest 007 movie, and he came from a freestyle background like myself.'

'It's exciting to think about pursuing that path.'
