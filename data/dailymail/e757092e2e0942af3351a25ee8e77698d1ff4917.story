A cat from the Canary Islands has mysteriously turned up 2,000 miles away in a Scottish fishing village leaving locals utterly baffled as to how she got there.

The wandering moggy, who has been nicknamed Juanita , was found cowering in a garage in the village of Muchalls, Aberdeenshire, on Thursday morning.

Rosy Long, 66, found the distressed tabby while putting her car away after a day trip with her husband William.

Littlest hobo: But just how did Juanita, pictured with her finder Rosy Long, make it from the Canary Islands to a Scottish fishing village in Aberdeenshire?

They assumed she was a neighbours and took her to the vets to have her ID chip scanned - where they found out she had been registered  on the sunshine island of Fuerteventura.

Rosy explained: 'We imagined if she had a microchip then we would maybe find an address in Muchalls and we could take her back to her owners.

'But when we scanned her it was the Canary Islands - we couldn’t quite believe it.

'The cat is so young - under a year old. For someone to have brought her over from the Canary Islands they must have paid a fair bit.

'It just seems a total mystery.'

The cat’s ID chip was tracked down to the Spanish database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip

William had been up at 6am on Thursday morning to get the car out of the garage up the road from their house.

BY AIR - With Ryan Air operating flights between Fuerteventura and Manchester, it is conceivable that Juanita could have stowed away on board a plane before making the final leg to Aberdeenshire on foot. But at around four kilos in weight it is unlikely she would have got past the airline's check-in staff without being asked to pay a hefty surcharge.

BY LAND - Passenger ferries regularly run between the island and mainland Spain. Could the adventurous puss have smuggled herself into the back of a car or lorry and hitch-hiked her way through France before joining other migrants in Sangatte and slipping past Britain's border controls?

BY SEA - Attracted by the smell of fresh sardines, Juanita may have sauntered aboard a Spanish fishing vessel setting off on a trip to UK waters before docking at the fishing village of Muchalls to stock up on oatcakes.

Rosy reckoned that the cat had chased her husband inside looking for human contact as there was no-one else around at that time in the morning.

She said: 'The poor little thing had presumably ran into the garage at 6am when we took the car out in the morning.

'She seemed frantic. We let her out and put her in our back garden.

'She’s just a young thing - not the kind of cat you would just leave. She just seemed lost and kept coming back to us.'

Cat-loving Rosy and her husband spent the day knocking on doors in the fishing village looking for the owners or anyone who knew whose cat it was - but with no luck.

They eventually took her to the vets in the nearby town of Stonehaven where they made the shock discovery that she had been chipped in the Spanish island chain.

At first the vets checked the local database to see if the cat had been registered in Aberdeenshire.

When the search drew a blank they searched the UK database - which also came back with no results.

Eventually the cat’s ID chip was tracked down to the Spanish database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip.

Rosy, who is a visually impaired artist who often paints her own two cats, said she was keen to reunite Juanita with her owner as soon as possible.

She said: 'She was obviously cared for - she was fit and healthy and had a pink sparkly collar on.'She must be a loved pet that someone is missing.'

Juanita is now in the care of the staff at Kirkton Veterinary Centre in Stonehaven.
