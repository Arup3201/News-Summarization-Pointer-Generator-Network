Paul Hollywood won viewers’ praise and support as the happily married presenter of Bake Off.

Rumours: Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood is facing the wrath of an unforgiving public amid rumours he left his wife for Marcela Valladolid, 34, a co-star on the US version of the BBC show

Hundreds of fans of the BBC show have now taken to the social networking site and other message forums to express their disappointment Hollywood has left his marital home and has been linked to Marcela Valladolid.

So appalled are they by his behaviour many have stated they don’t want him back on the show – leaving producers in a ‘tricky position’ over what to do.

A show source said yesterday: ‘There has been a viewer backlash against Paul over these allegations. A lot of fans on Twitter and other sites are saying they don’t want him back.

‘This hint of scandal has put producers in a tricky position because it is a really wholesome show.

‘Whatever the truth - I don’t know if people will look at Paul in the same way anymore.

‘It’s a shame because what people love about Bake Off is how innocent and simple it is.

‘Paul and Mary seem a million miles from the likes of Gordon Ramsay, so it does tarnish him to be linked to his US co-star.’

Earlier
this week it emerged Mary Berry, who has been married for 47 years, and
presents Great British Bake Off with Hollywood, has defended him 
telling friends: ‘You can’t blame him, things happen and boys will be 
boys’.

It is understand she has also urged him to patch things up with his wife of 14 years Alexandra by ‘apologising’ and ‘moving on’.

Couple? Marcela Valladolid with Paul Hollywood on The American Baking Competition

However,
viewers appear less reluctant to forgive him for being linked to 
Mexican Miss Valladolid , 34, with one stating on Twitter: ‘Just heard 
news/rumour about Paul Hollywood, 47, and pretty disappointed…what is it
with chefs and their philandering? Pleaseeee don’t say that Paul 
Hollywood is a love rat? GBBO will never be quite the same!#gutted.’

Another said: ‘Paul Hollywood has ruined the GBBO. I’m so disappointed with him.’

And Lewis Wilson@wilsonlw93 added: ‘How could Paul Hollywood do that to his wife!! #shocked #shame #on #him’.

Miss Valladolid, who has a nine-year-old son, has also been forced to pull her main Facebook page following a torrent of abuse.

Hollywood
and Miss Valladolid are believed to have ‘hit it off from day one’ 
during the filming of The American Baking Competition on which they 
appear as judges.

She has publicly described him as a ‘handsome devil’.

While
shooting in Georgia in March and April, the co-judges frequently posted
pictures together on Twitter. And since he returned to the UK, the 
pair’s Twitter conversations have carried on, with Miss Valladolid 
telling him on one occasion she was sending him a ‘big hug’.

Another BBC source said there had been a big difference in Mr Hollywood’s behaviour following the huge success of GBBO.

He
bought himself a £135,000 new Aston Martin DB9,  regularly shops for 
designer clothes and according to the source had started to believe 
people when they compared him to Simon Cowell: ‘There was a change in 
Paul Hollywood in the last series. People kept comparing him to Simon 
Cowell and I think he started to believe it.

Hundreds of fans of the BBC show have now taken to the social networking site and other message forums to express their disappointment

‘He began to see himself as “someone” and believe all the hype. It happens when fame comes late to TV personalities - they try to “upgrade” their lives:  ‘America, glossy girlfriend, flash car. This American deal seems to have tipped things over the edge.’

In recent days Mrs Hollywood, 49, has been pictured looking strained and not wearing her wedding ring at the four-bedroom family home near Canterbury.

She is reported to have told friends she has been completely ‘blindsided’ by the separation and that her priority now is looking after the pair’s 11-year-old son. Another friend said Hollywood was ‘totally distraught about the devastation he is causing’.
