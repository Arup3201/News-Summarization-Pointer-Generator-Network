A meteor streaking though the night sky above the English Channel has been captured on camera.

The fireball, which was filmed off the coast of Dawlish in Devon by a webcam, appears to burn up in the sky before disappearing.

The footage was spotted by the operators of a live webcam set up beside a section of railway line in Dawlish.

The blazing fireball footage was captured at around 1am last Wednesday.

It flares brightly above Lyme Bay, just off the caost of Devon, for a few seconds before vanishing close to the horizon.

Simon Dean, one of the operators of the webcam at Dawlish Beach Camera, said he had been watching the live camera footage when he saw the fireball.

He said that he often checks the camera to watch night-time repairs being carried out on the railway track after it was damaged in storms last year.

Mr Dean, who lives in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The camera has a night time mode and I just happened to be looking at it when I saw this bright light move across the sky.

'I wasn't really sure what I saw so I asked Neil Salter who runs the camera to send me the footage so I could have another look.

'We are not really sure what it is, but it looks like it could be a meteor.'

After the footage was posted on the webcam's Facebook page, other residents in Devon began reporting seeing similar things.

Steve Wilson said that his mother in law and daughter saw the fireball from Braunton in North Devon.

Karen Corbett from Torquay also said she saw the meteor.

Officials at the UK Meteor Observation Network said they had not received any reports of meteor sightings in the area.

The nearby Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth said it was currently looking through its sensors to see if it had detected the meteor.

Experts have said the fireball is likely to be a meteor a few inches across that broke apart in the atmosphere

Some have suggested the fireball may have been a sunlight flare reflected from the panels of an Iridium satellite.

However, as the course of these satellites is well known, such flares can be reliably predicted and none were expected to occur above the UK on that date.

Dr Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: 'It certainly looks like a meteor to me – it brightens erratically and seems to expand and contract in the close-up shots as if it’s breaking apart.

'A ‘flare’ of reflected sunlight from an Iridium satellite would brighten smoothly and look more symmetrical.

'The other possibility I considered was a ship’s distress flare, but the speed and trajectory seem wrong for that.

'This kind of bright meteor or "fireball" is not particularly rare but, as the video shows, they’re quite brief and so often go unnoticed.

'To me it looks like the object either disappears behind a bank of clouds near the horizon or just disintegrates in mid-air.

The erratic flaring of the fireball above as it traveled across the sky makes it likely that it was a meteor

The fireball flares up brightly for a few seconds before disappearing close to the horizon over Lyme Bay

'A meteor this bright is probably a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres across. 

'From the video it’s hard to say whether any of it survived to fall into the sea or whether it just burnt up completely in the atmosphere.'

The day before the video, residents in York also reported seeing a fireball in the sky.

Last June a large green fireball was spotted passing over the UK and was caught on camera by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Devon.

On that occasion the bolide meteor was reported to have broken into several pieces as it entered the Earth's atmosphere.

Dr Kukula added: 'The spread of cheap CCTV recording in recent years means that many more of them are now being picked up - which is useful for scientists, both because they can get a better idea of their actual frequency and because the meteor’s trajectory and apparent speed can give valuable information about where it came from. '

The weekend was also due to be the peak for the Alpha Centaurid meteor shower, although these are supposed to be only visible in the southern hemisphere.

The next major meteor shower due to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere will be the Lyrids that will peak on 22 April shortly before dawn.
