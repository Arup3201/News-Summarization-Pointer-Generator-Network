Almost 50 Russian diplomats and members of their families have been charged in a massive health care fraud scheme, officials announced Thursday.

Federal officials allege that 58 of the 63 births to Russian officials living in New York between 2004 and 2013 were fraudulently paid for by Medicare at a cost of roughly $1.5million to US taxpayers.

The Russians were applying for these benefits while emptying their pockets at famed stores such as Bloomingdale’s, Jimmy Choo’s, Prada and Tiffany & Co, officials said.

The fraudsters carried out the plan by applying for a range of benefits, including Medicare, by falsifying information on applications including income levels and citizenship status of children, officials said.

‘Being a diplomat does not give you the right to commit health care fraud,’ FBI special agent in charge of the New York field office George Venizelos said during a Thursday news conference detailing the allegations.

The diplomats and their spouses were able to exploit a loop hole allowing them to apply for benefits without proving US citizenship because the child is presumed to acquire US citizenship at birth.

Diplomats, their spouses and their children are not generally entitled to Medicare benefits except in cases of emergency, officials noted.

‘As the complaint alleges, the scam exploited a weakness in the Medicaid system, and the charges expose shameful and systemic corruption among Russian diplomats in New York,’ Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said.

By under reporting income by thousands of dollars per month, having income statements verified by various official offices and even claiming spouses were brothers, expectant Russian mothers wed to diplomats were able to carry out the fraud.

Lying to city and state claims processors provided them with Medicare benefits for prenatal care, birth and young children – which they were not entitled to receive.

‘Diplomacy should be about extending hands, not picking pockets in the host country,’ Mr Barara added.

Two diplomats falsely stated they were brother and sister instead of spouses, entitling them to more than $21,000 in benefits.

Three others provided documents showing their children were American citizens when in fact they were Russian nationals living in New York.

The defendants received hundreds of thousands of dollars in Medicare income while spending tens of thousands on cruises, watches, shows, jewelry and other luxuries.

‘The pattern of spending by the Russian diplomats and their spouses, including the defendants, is generally inconsistent with the grossly underreported incomes claimed on the Medicaid applications,’ the criminal complaint said.

The fraud was pervasive at all levels of Russia’s diplomatic mission in New York, officials said.

Timor Salomatin, a former diplomat at the Mission, and his wife, Nailya Babaeva applied for benefits stating Mr Salomatin’s income to be $3,000 a month at the same time he applied for a credit card saying his income was more than $8,000 a month.

The couple received more than $30,000 in benefits during a period they spent over $50,000 on purchases including in excess of $8,400 at the Apple Store and $10,000 each at several retailers including Bloomingdale’s and Prada.

Their documents were signed off on by Mikhail Korneev – falsely confirming an underreporting of the couple’s income.

Andrey Artasov and Nataliya Artasova reported their income to be almost half of what it actually was, they also received Medicare benefits while hoarding tens of thousands of dollars in good from Apple and Swarovsky.

‘All sorts of lavish spending was going on,’ Mr Barara lamented.

Russian officials didn’t take the announcement lightly, saying through state news agency ITAR-Tass that ‘Russophobic forces’ are conspiring to spoil Russia-US relations.

The complaint asks for the Russian government to arrest and hand over all 49 officials accused in the fraud – 11 are currently in the US, the rest have returned to Russia.

Diplomats have immunity from criminal prosecution, which will likely shield them from ever having to answer the charges.

‘All of these defendants have diplomatic immunity due to the nature of their work for the Russian government,’ said Mr Barara.

US officials can ask for that immunity to be revoked, but Russian officials don’t appear to take the charges seriously enough to comply.
