A teenage girl has appeared in court charged with murdering her newborn baby.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was arrested after the baby boy, who was choked to death, was found at a house in Baston, Lincolnshire.

She appeared at Grantham Magistrates' Court accused of murdering the baby between September 2 and September 6 and was remanded into local authority care to appear before Lincoln Crown Court this afternoon.

Remanding the girl, Chair of the Bench
Richard Tollemache told her: 'I hope you do understand what is going 
on. It must be frightening for you. I feel for you.

'We
are going to remand you into custody in the care of the local authority
and we are going to send this case up to Crown Court this afternoon.'

Detective
Superintendent Tony Heydon, from the East Midlands major crime team, 
who is leading the investigation described the case as ‘horrific and 
very sad’.

He said questioning had been delayed because the teenager required medical treatment in hospital.

Police have not been able to say precisely how old the baby was but have confirmed he has not been named.

A post-mortem carried out after the killing revealed the cause of death was an obstruction of the airway.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
