At least eight Palestinian schoolchildren have been killed after their bus hit a lorry in the West Bank.

Around 50 students, some as young as five or six, were onboard the bus taking them to Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem during the morning rush hour.

The vehicle flipped onto its side and burst into flames. Around 30 children and at least one teacher were injured.

According to Israeli police the injured were taken to both Israeli and Palestinian hospitals and at least eight have died. Palestinian police say the death toll was 10.

There were no signs of foul play. The 
truck driver was said to be an Arab Israeli citizen who may have lost 
control in heavy rains and slippery roads.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 
described the accident as a horrific national disaster and has declared 
three days of mourning and ordered flags flown at half staff.

The AFP news agency reported hospital officials in Ramallah saying many of the bodies they had seen were badly burned.
