Manchester United team-mates Juan Mata and Ander Herrera have battled it out in an 18-yard crossbar challenge... and it couldn't have been much tighter.

The video, posted by F2 Freestylers, pits the multi-million-pound midfielders against each other in a contest designed to prove which United star is better at hitting the crossbar from 18-yards out.

The competition started slowly, with just three hits in the first three minutes of the video. From there, the players step up a gear and it gets competitive.

Herrera, at 2-1 up, calls out: 'Pass me the ball please. I'm going to finish this game.'

But he doesn't manage it, and Mata manages to level the scores at 2-2 shortly after.

Mata and Herrera, who signed for United for £37 million and £29 million respectively, struggled to find a winner and the contest was taken to a sudden-death shootout with the scores at 3-3.

Despite being behind for the majority of the challenge, Mata nicks the win in sudden death, to the dismay of his Spanish colleague.

And to rub it in further, Mata cheekily adds: 'Keep training, yeah.'

After the competition, Mata told Herrera to 'keep training' after inflicting defeat on him in the contest
