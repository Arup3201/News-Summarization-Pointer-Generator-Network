Killed: Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman, was gunned down on May 6

A billionaire Monaco heiress and her Cambridge University graduate husband were in custody last night suspected of 'masterminding' the assassination of her equally wealthy mother.

Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman who was close to the royals who run the Mediterranean principality, was gunned down in a hail of bullets on May 6.

She and her chauffer both died of their wounds following the attack outside L'Archet hospital in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco.

Now police believe that her daughter, Sylvia Pastor, 53, and her husband, Wojciech Janowski, 65, ordered the Mafia-style hit.

A total of 19 arrests have been made in connection with the attack in French cities including Nice, Marseille and Rennes.

A spokesman for the Marseille prosecutor, which is leading the investigation into the double murder, said: 'A number of arrests have been made, and a police operation in connection with the killings is ongoing.'

The spokesman confirmed French media reports that Sylvia Pastor was among those arrested, along with Wojciech Janowski, who has been Poland's Honorary Consul in Monaco since 2007.

'The arrested man, who was apprehended
 by police [yesterday] afternoon, is the suspected mastermind, and is in 
custody along with his wife,' said the spokesman.

Born
 in Warsaw in 1949, Janowski graduated from Cambridge in the early 
1970s, before getting involved in a number of major companies in the 
water treatment, casino and hotel sectors.

He was made an Officer of the Order of
 Merit by the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 for his 
'charitable activities'. 

Mrs
 Pastor's driver, 64-year-old Mohammed Darwish, succumbed to wounds in 
the face, neck and stomach - dying on May 10, shortly before his boss.

Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, of carrying out the double assassination.

Both crime gangs are said to be building property portfolios on the French Riviera as they expand their field of operations.

Mrs Pastor's family own buildings worth billions in the area, and detectives believe the Mafia were trying to muscle in.

Mrs Pastor had been visiting her son, Gildo, who runs a car hire company, at the Nice hospital when a solo gunman struck.

In a classic Mafia-style hit, he shot 
both Mrs Pastor and her chauffer in the head and stomach with a 
pump-action shotgun through their car window.

Following the attack, the hit man jumped into a waiting getaway car driven by another man, and then sped off.

 MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double 
assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement 
expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family.

Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February.

Her daughter and son, already rich in their own right, would have become billionaires on their mother's death.

The Marseille prosecutor has now opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV.

'We
 are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the 
attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source.

He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'.

Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large parts of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor.

The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret.

Brice Robin, the Marseille prosecutor, will hold a press conference on the case today.
