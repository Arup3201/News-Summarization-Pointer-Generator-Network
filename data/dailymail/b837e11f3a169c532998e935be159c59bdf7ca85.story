Controversial wannabe model Josie Cunningham has shocked the public and hit a new low after selling four ringside seats to the birth of her third child.

The baby, who she initially planned to abort to appear on Big Brother, is due to be born in October at her home in Leeds.  

But this morning, the wannabe-model announced to her 27,000 Twitter fans that the four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

Josie Cunningham, pictured, had originally planned to sell footage of the birth of her third child on DVDs through a nationwide chain of pound shops but she later revealed to her fans on Twitter the deal had fallen through 

Now, she has told her followers on Twitter that she has sold four tickets to fans who will have  ringside seats

Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two sold for £5,000 each. Ms Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos.

On social media, reaction to the latest publicity stunt has been almost universally negative with commentators criticising her decision to make money from the birth of her child. 

One Twitter user,posed the question that it was the British public who shared the blame for her fame as they have made Ms Cunningham 'a viable commodity'. 

However, Ms Cunningham has suggested that some of the cash from the event could be used to reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.  

Ms Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. 

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. 

Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Commentators on Twitter were particularly critical of Ms Cunningham's latest moneymaking idea 

Ms Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the son she is due to give birth to in October because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-two later she she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Eventually Leeds City Council decided to axe the service which prompted Ms Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

Later she said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Now she is hoping to make £40,000 from the birth of her third child by allowing four fans to witness the event.

Initially, Ms Cunningham had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling DVDs of the event through a chain of pound shops.

Ms Cunningham has even involved herself in the debate surrounding the death of Peaches Geldof.

She accused the daughter of former Boomtown Rat Bob and Paula Yates of being a bad mother. 

She told her Twitter followers: 'Really irritates me that the same trolls sending me s**t since the abortion story are STILL defending peaches!! (sic)'

Ms Cunningham said she was going to take to Twitter tonight at 9pm in order to allow her fans to ask her questions directly on any subject. 

However, during previous question and answer sessions, the heavily pregnant model received some serious abuse.
