It was reportedly cloudy and raining when the jet crashed into houses in the port city of Santos, 43 miles east of Sao Paulo in south-east Brazil.

According to reports, the other six people travelling with him on the plane were also killed, as well as at least four people on the ground.

The other people on board the plane who were killed in the crash were the two pilots, Campos' private secretary and press officer, and a photographer and a cameraman documenting his election campaign.

Logistics analyst Tassio Silva, 25, who witnessed the accident said the plane 'fell nose first' at an angle of 65 degrees.

He said: 'I work 200 metres from where the plane came down. My desk is in front of the window. I was stunned, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was an explosion and a lot of smoke. The emergency crews arrived quickly.'

Campos had hours earlier given an interview on Brazil's main news programme, Jornal Nacional, where he had promised free public transport for state school student, to increase public health care spending by ten per cent and to increase national security budget by ten-fold.

Campos was born in Recife, Pernambuco state, in 1965 and was the grandson of renowned leftist leader and former Pernambuco governor Miguel Arraes. 

According to Air Force officials, air traffic control lost contact with the 12-seater plane after it could not land in Guaruja due to poor visibility.

Mr Campos, 49, was governor of Penambuco state before announcing he was running for president in the October 15 elections.

Previously he had served for 20 years as a state then federal congressman.
