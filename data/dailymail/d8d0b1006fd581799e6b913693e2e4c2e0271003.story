The popularity of Disney’s smash hit Frozen has led to a surge in web searches for family holidays in Norway.

Calling it the ‘Frozen effect’, travel website Expedia.co.uk is reporting a 60 per cent increase in the number of searches for destinations in the Nordic country, including Naeroyfjord, the municipality that inspired the animated film’s snowy setting.

It suggests Britons are looking to take their children to a ‘real-life’ frozen fantasy land similar to Arendelle, the fictional kingdom that is home to orphaned sisters Anna and Elsa, the film’s lead characters.

Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, said: ‘The unprecedented popularity of Frozen has increased the mystique and allure of wintery destinations and demand for Norway has increased over 2014 as a whole.

‘Now, with Christmas and the new year around the corner parents are looking to make the movie a reality for their children.’

The name Arendelle is based on Arendal, a port town on Norway’s southern coast, while buildings in Oslo, Bergen and other cities served as inspiration for some of Frozen's scenes.

Oslo’s Akershus Fortress, for example, was used as the basis for Anna and Elsa’s castle in Arendelle.

Price comparison website Icelolly.com said it frequently receives enquiries from parents whose children want to visit the land that inspired the film’s setting.

Arendal and Norway are among its most popular winter holiday destinations for 2015, in addition to Lapland, France and Canada.

Suniel Makh, brand director at Icelolly.com, said: ‘The nation has taken Queen Elsa, Princess Anna and snowman Olaf into their hearts and we've seen a growing number of people desperately wanting to visit their mythical world.’

The company is now looking at offering Frozen-themed trips, he added.
