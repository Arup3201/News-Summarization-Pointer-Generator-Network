Media mogul Alexander Lebedev faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of politically-motivated hooliganism

A witness at media tycoon Alexander Lebedev’s trial yesterday said she was  giving evidence against him ‘by accident’.

Natalia Parkhomenko told how she went to see the Russian  version of the FBI – the Investigative Committee – on a separate matter and was told they needed people to testify against Mr Lebedev, the owner of the Evening Standard and The Independent newspapers.

Mr Lebedev faces up to five years in jail in Russia after he punched a property mogul during a TV talk show.

In recent weeks, several witnesses have refused to testify for the state. But Miss Parkhomenko did – albeit unwittingly.

‘I am here totally incidentally,’ she said. ‘I came to the Investigative Committee on a completely different matter and was asked, “By the way, did you watch that show? We need witnesses”. So I am here.’

She told the court she could ‘hardly remember’ the verbal dispute and ensuing punch which was aired on a Russian TV channel 20 months ago. ‘I got a call that I must come today or they will force me to come. I gave up an exam I was due to take today.’

Miss Parkhomenko told the court she found the incident ‘extraordinary’ when she watched it on TV, adding: ‘I don’t remember anything like this.’

But she also said that Sergei Polonsky – the man Mr  Lebedev struck – had verbally provoked the media owner.

‘I want to say I do not see Lebedev’s guilt in it. I think both are to blame here,’ she said. The case turns on whether Mr Lebedev was ‘politically motivated’ in twice striking Mr Polonsky, an accusation he strongly denies.

A similar charge of ‘politically motivated hooliganism’ was brought against two Pussy Riot singers who were jailed for two years for a cathedral protest against president Vladimir Putin.

Charge: Alexander Lebedev is accused of politically-motivated 'hooliganism' after punching Sergei Polonsky on Russian television

Testimony: A witness told the court she had been ordered to give evidence by the Russian secret service

Mr Lebedev, 53, was in court yesterday, accompanied by his wife Elena Perminova, a 26-year-old Siberian-born model.

Two cameramen were also called as 
witnesses for the prosecution. One, Oleg Tikhomirov saying that Polonsky
‘did say something rude to Lebedev – or something abusing’ before the 
strike.

Farce: Lebedev and his lawyer quizzed two cameramen who were called in to give evidence at his trial

Mr Lebedev quizzed him directly and asked if either he or Mr Polonsky were politicians.

‘For me, you are a politician but in the best meaning of this word,’ said Mr Tikhomirov.

‘I also appreciate you as a donor who 
helps clinics and museums – unfortunately, I have not heard anything of 
this sort about Polonsky, on the contrary.’

Mr Lebedev asked: ‘Did I ever use rude
language?’ Mr Tikhomirov replied: ‘I don’t think so. I am really 
sympathetic to you. But Polonsky did say something like “somebody who 
does not have a million can go to you know where”.’

At this point, the judge stopped the 
exchange and asked the other cameraman, Mikhail Shirokov: ‘Do you 
remember Lebedev and Polonsky discussing something political – such as 
laws being adopted?’

He said: ‘No, I can’t remember anything like this.’

Another prosecution witness revealed 
that she had been randomly approached to give evidence against Mr 
Lebedev after stepping off a No 75 bus in Moscow. 

Sociologist Yulia Kamashina, a mother 
of three in her late 30s, was asked directly in court by Mr Lebedev how 
she came to be taking part in the trial.

‘Somebody approached me in the street,’ she replied.

Celebrity backing: Both Keira Knightley and Sir Elton John have sent letters in support of Lebedev

‘I was asked: ‘Did you watch that 
political show? Are you ready to talk about it and sign the statement? I
thought about it and agreed.

‘There are not that many bright events like this on our TV, so I recalled it and agreed.’

Mr Lebedev said earlier that with an 
acquittal rate of 0.4 per cent in Russian courts, he does not expect to 
win but that the accusation against him was ‘trumped up’.

Mr Polonsky was not in court.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
