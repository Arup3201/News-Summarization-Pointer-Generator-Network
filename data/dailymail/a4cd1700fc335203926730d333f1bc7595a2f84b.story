A lesbian confessed to her partner in a prison gym that she had tortured and killed a retired bus conductor in his bungalow, a court has heard.

Kelly Barnes, 32, claimed that her civil partner Jodie Barnes, 31, made the admission to her when they were on remand, charged with murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve.

The drug addict couple, who both deny murder, are accused of targeting Mr Reeve, 67, as they believed he had large sums of money.

Accusations:  Kelly Barnes, 32, right, claimed that her civil partner Jodie Barnes, 31, left, made the admission to her when they were on remand, charged with murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve

Norwich Crown Court heard how the pensioner was punched, stamped on and cut with a knife in an alleged attempt to ‘torture’ him and force him to disclose his PIN number.

Mother-of-four Kelly admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash.

But she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, Norfolk.

Kelly claimed that Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

She said: 'I asked Jo die if she did it. She said she did. I was devastated. I don’t think I was angry. I was in shock in prison and did not know what to do.'

Kelly said that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had previously given her money.

She admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking.

Kelly said: 'Jodie knocked on the front door and it opened. She said, "Can my wife come in?’.'I went straight into the living room. Jodie was in the hallway with Barry. The living room door was partially open, but more shut.

'I heard her say, "Barry, can I have some money?’ I heard him say he didn’t have any.'

Kelly admitted searching the living room for objects to steal and then did the same in Mr Reeve’s bedroom.

But she insisted that she did not harm Mr Reeve and she was ‘positive’ that she didn’t see Jodie using any violence.

She said she then saw Jodie looking through drawers in the pensioner’s kitchen and taking food from his freezer.

Kelly said they took property away in five or six bags which they left in his garden by a tree.

She said they went to a Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried to use a bank card in a cash machine. She claimed that she did not know at the time that the card belonged to Mr Reeve.

They then caught a taxi back to Mr Reeve’s home to collect the stolen property from his garden before returning to the Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried used the cash machine again.

Kelly added: 'I can remember Jodie saying that she had done something silly. I said, "What do you f*****g mean? I was a bit concerned.

'I don’t think she gave me any explanation to be fair.'

Kelly admitted using Mr Reeve’s mobile phone after it was taken from his home.

She claimed she did not know how Mr Reeve’s blood got on to her Nike trainers, but she said her clothing sometimes got ‘mixed up’ with Jodie’s clothes when they undressed at night.

Under cross-examination by Mukhtar Hussain QC who is defending Jodie, she described the murder of Mr Reeve as ‘horrendous’.

She also admitted that she had lied about some matters in the past including once falsely claiming that a social worker was a paedophile.

Kelly denied that she was trying to shift the blame on to Jodie in revenge for her partner cheating on her.

The court has heard that Mr Reeve might have been alive for at least 24 hours hours after being attacked.

His body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia.

The court has heard that Mr Reeve’s blood was also found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie.

Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash.

The trial continues.
