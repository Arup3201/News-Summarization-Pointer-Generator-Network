Not only does billionaire Donald Trump not 'regret' questioning President Barack Obama's birth place, Trump now says there's 'a very good chance' president Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to attract financial aid money in college.

'Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got 
into colleges,' Trump said, 'People were doing that.'

The Apprentice star told Washington-based reporters on Tuesday that he still doesn't understand why president Obama would turn down a $50 million gift to charity if he's telling the truth about his past.

Donald Trump, chairman and president of the Trump Organization, said today it's possible that president Obama was born in the U.S. but lied on college applications and said he was from Kenya. 'Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got into colleges,' Trump said

Trump's disbelief that Obama is indeed an American citizen, as required by law to hold the presidency, stems from a typo in a book agency's 1991 biography of Barack Obama, in which Obama was listed as being from Kenya.

After the bio surfaced in 2012 a former editor at the book company said it was 'a fact checking error.'

Trump isn't as sure the line itself was a mistake as he is that then-Illinois state senator Barack Obama made a mistake in having it put in his promotional materials.

Even after Obama released documentation of his birth, Trump said he remained unconvinced.

Several days before the 2012 presidential election, Trump announced that he was offering President Obama $5 million to put toward a charity in his home town, Chicago, Illinois, if he turned over his birth certificate, passport and college records.

Trump says he later increased that amount to $50 million, a number that was not reported in the media at the time, but Obama still wouldn't play ball.

' I never heard from him,' Trump said on Tuesday, adding that he would take the money if it were the other way around.

'The Donald' got on the subject of Obama's background today after he was asked during the Q and A portion of a National Press Club luncheon if he regretted his past statements about the president's birthplace.

'Not even a little bit,' Trump said. 'I don't regret it.'

'Why would I regret it?' he asked amid applause from the audience.

Trump said there were three scenarios to explain Obama's past: 'Either it's fine, or he was born in Kenya, or in my opinion there's a 
very good chance he was born here, and said he was born in Kenya. 
Because if you were born in Kenya, you got into colleges, and you got 
aid,' Trump said. 'Very simple.'

Though many Americans have tired of Trump's quest to see Obama's personal records, Trump claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue.

'Now I hope that it's 100 percent fine,' Trump said, but later mentioned 'I'd love to see what's put down.'

Believe it or not, Donald Trump's hair is real

'They attack my hair. It's mine,' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?'

Unlike Obama, Trump says he's all facts and no fiction. His hair? Totally real, Trump said on Tuesday.

'They attack my hair. It's mine,' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?'

'They say you wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen, what a horrible wig,' he continued, explaining that he's made it clear on Twitter that his hair is real, yet people keep claiming it's fake for some reason he said.

'You know it's funny, but when people wanna keep going, they keep going,' Trump noted.

The billionaire was less forthcoming about whether or not he has any big political plans for 2016.

'We’re going to see what happens in ‘16,' he said. '

If I don’t see the 
right person, I will do something in ’16.  I will do it sure as you’re 
sitting here.'

Trump said he thinks its likely that Obama was born in the United States after all and instead lied on college applications about being born in Kenya

The Donald also said he doesn't understand why people don't believe his hair is real and that he's still deciding whether to run for president in 2016
