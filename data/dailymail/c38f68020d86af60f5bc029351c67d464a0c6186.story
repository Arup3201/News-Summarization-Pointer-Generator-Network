The mystery man who took almost 500 selfies over a 30 year period has been identified as photobooth technician Franklyn Swantek.

Mr Swantek was owner of Swantek Photo Service which described itself as 'Michigan's largest operators and distributors of Photomatic'.

The 455 images form part of a exhibition at Rutgers University's Zimmerli Art Gallery in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Curators at the gallery were unaware of Mr Swantek's identity until his nephew Tom Trelenberg from Minden, Nevada logged on to the internet and saw a story about the mysterious man.

Scrolling through the images, Mr Trelenberg said: 'Wow, that looks a lot like Uncle Franklyn.'

As he read through the article, which speculated that the man may have been a photobooth technician, adding, 'I knew it was him.' 

According to Mr Trelenberg, he would regularly visit his uncle's home in New Boston, Michigan during the summer.

'Uncle Franklyn was a lot of fun, just a cheerful guy. It’s why I kept going back. I remember helping him tear apart Photomatics that weren’t being used anymore. As payment, he let me keep whatever I found in the coin box.'

Mr Trelenberg said his uncle was the co-owner of a plane as well as an avid fisherman who owned a cabin.

He said: 'There are a lot of great family stories about Uncle Franklyn.'

His uncle even visited Mr Trelenberg's home in Nevada until his death in in the mid 1980s, even visiting a casino. 'We’d walk down the street, and Uncle Franklyn would pull out a coin, run up to a door and try to shove it in the keyhole.

'Then, he’d turn to us and say, "Sorry, I thought it was another of those slot machines!"'

Donna Gustafson of Zimmerli gallery said: 'Now
 that the man has a name, the 445 portraits have gone from an essay on 
passing time focused on a single face to a real person with a 
biography.

'The story comes full circle and returns the
 photographs in a strange and beautiful way to the family.'

Her colleague Susan Sidlauskas of the Rutgers Department of Art History  added: 'Knowing that this man was ‘the fun 
uncle’ allows us to see these hundreds of images less as a curiosity 
than as evidence of one man’s ability to perform multiple selves, and in
 so doing reach across time.

'There’s a twinkle in his
 eye that suggests that he had a reason for holding on to all those 
photos.'

Mr Trelenberg said he particularly enjoyed visiting his uncle's house in New Boston, Michigan while he was growing up

The photographs were bought by Donald Lokuta said he believed Mr Swantek knew exaclty what he was doing by keeping the images. 'He was making a record of his life,' he said.

Mr Swantek's story is now being written by author Näkki Goranin in American Potobooth.

Most of the pictures show Mr Swantek grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes.

In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit.

The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'.

Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, "Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?"'

'There’s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.'
