The father of Anders Behring Breivik has told of his anguish at not having done more to extinguish the extreme views that led his son to massacre 77 people in Norway in 2011.

Jens Breivik's dreams are still haunted by the image of his son indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range on the island of Utoya as he trampled over their classmates' corpses, in what became the largest killing spree by a single person in history.

Yet while his nightmares are filled with visions of a monster, his memories are of an angelic five-year-old boy who enjoyed playing in the woods near his home and going on play-dates with his friends.

'What he did was terrible, I can never forgive him for that. Yet he is still my son. I feel sorry for him because I still think that there is some humanity in him,' Mr Breivik told the Daily Mirror from his home in Limoux, France.

Breivik detonated a bomb in central Oslo on July 22, 2011, killing eight, then took a boat to an island where the ruling Labour Party were holding a summer camp and shot dead 69 more people, mostly teenagers.

He was sentenced to 21 years in jail, the maximum in Norway though the term can be extended if there is deemed to be a risk he would commit new crimes.

He now refuses contact with his father, unless Mr Beivik joins his fascist one-man terror cell.

'Last year I phoned the prison to ask if I could visit him,' he told the paper. 'Four months later, I received a letter. It was cold and formal. He addressed it to 'Mr Jens Breivik' and signed it 'Anders Behring Breivik'.

'He was pursuing his ridiculous ideas. He said he'd only accept a visit if I became a fascist and joined his political regime. He won't have contact with me.'  

Jens Breivik, 78, has had only intermittent contact with his son since losing a legal battle for custody after a divorce from Anders' mother when he was four.

Now he wonders what more he could have done to win custody of his son and prevent his son from becoming 'so evil'. 

'At that time there was no precedent for a father to gain custody of a child after a divorce. I had to accept that his mother could keep him,' he said. 'I think if I had fought harder, if I had taken him with me, he would definitely have been another person today.'

He said at first Breivik showed no signs of extremism, rather, he seemed a happy child. He said when Breivik was 11, he moved back to Oslo from Paris to be closer to him. 

'We had good times together but it lasted only until 16, and then I lost contact with him,' he said. 'He became a member of a gang.'

He said he didn't hear from him until he received a brief phone call from his son saying he was 'doing well' with a company and two employees.

Mr Breivik is racked with guilt over not making more effort to see his son during that time. In 2011, he retired to France with his second wife Wanda, 74. 

He heard nothing of his son until images began appearing on televisions across the world of a man dressed in a policeman's uniform walking calmly through Utoya island shooting dead anyone who crossed his path.

But even then, Mr Breivik did not connect his son with the massacre. 

It was not until the killer's name was revealed that Mr Breivik understood the horrifying truth. 

'I was quite paralysed, I was in shock, I understood nothing,' he told Reuters last month. 'I was in a sort of coma.'

But he says one of his greatest fears is the fact his son's fascist, anti-immigrant views seem to be getting ever more extreme in jail.

But nevertheless, every thought he has about his son and that unspeakable summer's day in 2011 always comes back to one question: 'I have asked myself, 'Am I to blame for him becoming so extreme?' I ask, 'Could I have prevented it in some way?'

'I don't have an easy answer. It is very difficult being the father of a mass murderer. It keeps me awake. It worries me all the time.'
