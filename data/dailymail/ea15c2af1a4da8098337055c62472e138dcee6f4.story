Sam Allardyce's feud with the Senegal national team has intensified with the West Ham boss claiming he does not trust them to look after Diafra Sakho.

Mystery still surrounds the back injury the striker picked up while on international duty last month, even if it is not as severe as first thought.

Allardyce confirmed the 24-year-old has a shot of making the West Ham squad for the fixture against Swansea after an earlier diagnosis suggested he would be out until the end of the month.

West Ham manager Allardyce claims he does not trust Senegal to look after Diafra Sakho

But Allardyce is still seething at an injury he claimed was not caused by playing or training and says the player was ‘mistreated so badly’.

Allardyce now has a dilemma over whether to stretch his club’s own medical resources in order to send a chaperone when Sakho rejoins the Senegal side for the African Cup of Nations in January. Asked if he trusted the Senegal medical team with Sakho, Allardyce said: ‘I don’t, is the answer to that.

‘I think that we’ll have to have a discussion about that later down the line. We may consider sending somebody with them — to look after our asset.’

In Sakho’s absence, Andy Carroll has returned from a run of considerably worse injury problems which have wrecked his time at the club.

On Sunday, Allardyce will get a close view of Wilfried Bony, the prolific striker he opted against signing in 2013 in order to recruit Carroll for £15million.

He said: ‘We didn’t have enough money that year (to sign Bony as well). There is always a risk with any player that comes from abroad. Of course, in Swansea’s case it has paid off handsomely.’
