A television reporter has revealed the moment he was contacted by hostages from inside the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place on Monday, six hours after the siege began.

Mark Burrows from Nine News received phone calls from Marcia Mikhael and Julie Taylor with their hostage taker shiek just metres away, listening to their every word. He also spoke to one other hostage who was not named in the report.

During their conversations the women were forced to repeat Man Haron Monis's demands, but perhaps the most chilling details came from Ms Mikhael, a Westpac executive trapped inside the building with three of her colleagues.

Marcia Mikhael contacted Nine News reporter Mark Burrows six hours into the siege at Sydney's Martin Place

After greeting Burrows, the 42-year-old assured him that all the hostages were safe and well thanks to 'The Brother', which is how they were referring to their captor, a self-style shiek.

'However there was a very close missed call by people escaping and we almost got shot in here however we're all well,' Ms Mikhael revealed.

Speaking incredibly calmly for someone trapped in such a horrific situation, the only time she wavered was when speaking about Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Lawyer Julie Taylor also placed a phone call from inside the cafe, revealing calmly she was pregnant but unwell and frightened

Mark Burrows spoke to hostages from the Nine newsroom on Monday afternoon

'He (Man Haron Monis) would also like to speak to the prime minister, we understand that the prime minister is a very busy man however I think that the lives of quite a few people here are more important than whatever he's doing right now whether he's playing golf, or walking with his dog. 

'I don't know what the hell he's doing but it cannot be more important than picking up the phone and making one phone call, that is not hard,' the woman said with emotion in her voice.

Reports of a number of the hostages falling ill had circulated during the day and Burrows asked after their health. 

'We have one pregnant lady that's not doing very well and the other one is being very brave but she's also not doing very well,' Ms Mikhael said. 

'We don't want to die. There's a lot of people in here and we've got families. We want to go home and we want to go home safe.' 

Ms Mikael was one of the hostages pictured being carried out of the cafe, looking distressed and with blood on her legs when the siege ended. 

Another hostage to make contact with Nine News was Sydney barrister Julie Taylor, who was saved from the gunman by friend Katrina Dawson. Ms Dawson, a mother-of-three tragically died while being transported to hospital.

'There are a few sick people inside and also two pregnant people. I'm pregnant and there's one other lady who's pregnant. 

'He (Monis) says that he's made an offer, um, to trade one flag of Islamic State for a life,' Ms Taylor told Burrows.

The hostage also revealed hesitantly that although she and others were 'not exactly' being threatened by their captor, she was not feeling well and everyone was extremely frightened.

Ms Taylor also told Burrows that Monis did have a gun, and when prompted concluded it was a rifle of some description.

The barrister is currently recovering in hospital, along with three other women who suffered gunshot wounds. 

She was one of three women to appear in videos released by Monis where hostages to a camera relaying the demands of their captor. 

Barrister Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, both died as a result of the siege which shut down Sydney's CBD for more than 24 hours.
