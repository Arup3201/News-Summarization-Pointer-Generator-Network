These starkly-beautiful images bring to light the subterranean conditions endured by soldiers of the First World War while they were sheltering from constant artillery fire.

Even though the fear of death always hung over the men - or perhaps because of it - the soft stone of the carved-out walls are covered in personal expressions of identity and survival.

The stills were taken by Texan photographer Jeff Gusky, who chronicled the tunnels in France alongside National Geographic writer Evan Hadingham.

Mr Hadingham wrote: 'The entrance is a wet hole in the earth little bigger than an animal burrow, obscured by thorny brush in a secluded wood in northeastern France. Together we slither through the muddy hole into the darkness below.

'After a few hundred feet the tunnel ends at a little cubicle hewed out of the chalk, reminiscent of a telephone booth.'

U.S. troops of the 26th 'Yankee' Division, billeted in an underground quarry at Chemin des Dames, carved some 500 engravings during six weeks in 1918. These include names, addresses, religious and patriotic symbols, and other images.

Abandoned: Some quarries could shelter thousands of men and featured amenities such as electric light. By 1918 combined tank, artillery, and air attacks made battlefields more mobile, and armies began to abandon their underground redoubts.

He added: 'Here, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, German military engineers would take turns sitting in total silence, listening intently for the slightest sound of enemy tunnelers. Muffled voices or the scraping of shovels meant that a hostile mining team might be only yards away, digging an attack tunnel straight toward you.

'The danger grew if the digging stopped and you heard the sound of bags or cans being quietly stacked, one on top of another. It signaled that the enemy was laying high explosives at the end of the tunnel. Most nerve-racking of all was the silence that followed.

'At any moment the charges might detonate and blow you apart or bury you alive.'

Even a single small mine could wreak havoc. In one tunnel complex the men visited, a charge set off by the Germans on January 26, 1915, killed 26 French infantrymen and wounded 22 more.

The pair found graffiti left by the German engineers who manned this listening post, with names and regiments and a motto: 'Gott für Kaiser!' (God for the Kaiser!).

The scars of artillery barrages still pockmark the ruins of a fort at Chemin des Dames, where some 30,000 French troops died during ten days in April 1917. Underground, French and German forces tried to penetrate each other¿s tunnels, and sometimes they fought hand to hand in pitch-black passageways

The deadlock of trench warfare led both sides to tunnel beneath enemy positions and plant explosives. In the Oise Valley, German engineers dug this secret network of tunnels beneath the French front lines. On January 26, 1915, they detonated a charge that killed 26 French infantrymen and wounded 22

Soldiers relieved the tedium of underground life with signatures, sketches and caricatures, carvings, and even intricate relief sculptures.

Life in the quarries was vastly preferable to the muddy hell of the trenches above. A journalist visiting one of the caverns in 1915 noted that 'a dry shelter, straw, some furniture, a fire, are great luxuries for those returning from the trenches.'

But conditions were still grim. One French soldier wrote home: 'Vermin devour us, and it’s teeming with lice, fleas, rats and mice. What’s more, it’s very humid and a lot of the men fall sick.'

To pass the time, the exhausted men would daydream. Images of women proliferate on the quarry walls, including many sentimental and idealised portraits.

Troops left the relative comfort of an underground quarry via a carved stairway leading up to the trenches.

Faith: A hundred years ago in a subterranean chapel, an unknown artist carved this image of a French soldier praying. Artwork covers many abandoned passages under the western front

Among the most prolific decorators of the underground cities was the 26th 'Yankee' Division, one of the first U.S. units to reach the front following America’s entry into the war in April 1917.

To visit the quarry where they were billeted at Chemin des Dames, Hadingham and Gusky climb down two wobbly ladders into a cavern 30 feet below.

They spent hours exploring a hundred-acre complex, finding passageways strewn with countless bottles, shoes, shell cases, helmets, beds made of rusted chicken wire, even an entire cooking range with pots and pans still in place.

The images are from a feature - The Hidden world Of The Great War - in the August issue of National Geographic magazine. For more information please click here.

Although better than the trenches, conditions in the cavern were unpleasant and sudden death never far away
