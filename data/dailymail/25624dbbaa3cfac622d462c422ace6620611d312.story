Locals in a small Australian town have come up with a novel alternative to installing a toilet in their cemetery - by building an outhouse that looks like an upright coffin.

Residents of Millaa Millaa, Queensland, opted to build the macabre toilet after the council put the brakes on moves to build a restroom because it would cost around $82,000.

People from the town’s Chamber of Commerce decided to take matters into their own hands and carve out a coffin-shaped pit stop for visitors of the cemetery.

Macabre: The Chamber of Commerce in Millaa Millaa, Queensland, decided to build this coffin-shaped toilet to save on buying one for the town's cemetery

The toilet is deliberately constructed to resemble an upright coffin, and even has the haunting letters ‘RIP’ and a crucifix etched into one of the walls, according to the Huffington Post.

Chamber president Pat Reynolds built the coffin over the past few months in his garage and it has recently been installed in the cemetery.

‘You have to be careful, not everyone is going to have our macabre sense of humour,’ he told the Herald Sun newspaper. ‘But we did it with good intentions. It's for firstly, the cemetery, and secondly, maybe a few more people will notice Millaa Millaa now.’

The coffin had been meticulously constructed and has sturdy walls and a solid cement foundation, as well as an inbuilt septic system.

Small town: Milla Milla only has a modest population of 250 people

But after complaints from some members of the 250-strong community in Millaa Millaa, coupled with the fact it was never approved by the council, whether or not the DIY toilet will stay is in the balance. 

Its fate will likely be decided within the week.

Mayor of the Tablelands Regional Council Rosa Lee Long said whether the toilet will stay in Millaa Millaa will be discussed at the next meeting, according to cairns.com.au.

She said: ‘We'll be discussing it in the next week and talking to our staff about what we can do.’

Local Brian Norton believes the toilet may not go down too well with residents, especially mourners at the cemetery.

He told News.com.au: ‘Imagine if they had a funeral there.’

‘I don’t think it’s going to go over very well, especially if people are there from out of town.‘They’ll think: “What sort of place is this?”’

But many are keen to keep the toilet, and believe it gives the small town on the east coast of the country an identity of its own.

One Cairns Post reader said: ‘People need to lighten up and have a good laugh. Think of it this way – it's put Millaa Millaa on the map.’
