Veteran TV anchor and financial reporter Maria Bartiromo ended her 20-year tenure at CNBC on an emotional note today, breaking down in tears on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

'It's been hitting me all day,' Bartiromo later told her 'Closing Bell' co-anchor Bill Griffeth of her last day on CNBC.

Bartiromo's departure comes just days after she announced that she will be making a move to Fox Business Network.

Final farewell: A tearful CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo is overwhelmed as traders applaud her as she arrives on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for her last day at the network

Special honor: The 'clap-off' tradition is usually reserved for departing traders, but the stock exchange employees made an exception to honor the veteran anchor who is leaving after 20 years with CNBC

‘I won’t give you a long and mushy goodbye especially since I’ve been getting choked up all day,’ Bartiromo said at the end of ‘Closing Bell.’ ‘But I still must extend my love and thank you to many, as this is my last broadcast on CNBC.’

The photogenic 46-year-old TV presenter, affectionately nicknamed 'Money Honey,' joined CNBC in 1993, becoming the first journalist to report from the floor of the stock exchange.

On Friday, an emotional Miss Bartiromo detailed how the stock traders greeted her with applause this morning as part of a clap-off ritual – a tradition usually reserved for departing brokers.

‘The guys on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange really have been my family for so many years,’ Bartiromo said. ‘I just love all of you.’

New beginning: Bartiromo's contract with CNBC expires November 24, after which she will move to Fox Business Network

On Bartiromo's last day with CNBC, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high, reaching 16,064.7.

The anchor’s co-hosts created a graphic showing that the Dow has trended up over the course of Bartiromo’s two decades on air.

'I am coming back, you know,' Miss Bartiromo promised. 'I'm not going far.'

Bartiromo's contract with CNBC officially expires November 24. The New York Times and other media outlets reported Bartiromo is joining Fox Business Network.

The Fox network said it had no immediate announcement to make Monday.

Bartiromo has been at the helm of 'Closing Bell' for the past 11 years.

Looking to the future: Maria's co-anchor Bill Griffeth (left) will be joined on 'Closing Bell' Monday by CNBC's rising star Kelly Evans

On Monday, her co-anchor Bill Griffeth will be joined at 3pm by CNBC’s rising star Kelly Evans, who will then go on to anchor the 4pm hour with other reporters, Mediabistro reported. 

Bartiromo has already taped her final episode of 'On the Money', which airs this weekend. The syndicated show will then be taken over by Becky Quick.

The veteran host's departure after a long and fruitful career has been described as potentially problematic for the network since Bartiromo has been known to personally book high-profile guests for her show, Business Insider reported.

The network has a strict ‘first on CNBC’ booking policy, which means that guests must appear on CNBC before any other network.

With Bartiromo gone, along with her extensive list of big-name contacts, CNBC may have to revise its policy.    

New challenges: Maria Bartiromo (seen here in 2004) is leaving CNBC after 20 years with the network

Star power: Bartiromo joined CNBC as a young reporter in 1993 five years as a producer and assignment editor with CNN Business News

The Drudge Report was first to break the news regarding Bartiromo's move.

'After twenty great years of having a front row seat to some of the most important economic stories in the world, it's hard to sum up the gratitude and appreciation I have for the team that helped make it happen,' Bartiromo said in a statement.

'I am incredibly proud of what we have been able to accomplish.'

Her representative did not immediately respond when asked to comment on reports that she's going to Fox Business.

The New York Post's Claire Atkinson reported that Fox has
offered Bartiromo between $5 and $6million a year, compared to her $4million
contract with CNBC.

Bartirmo may also get a live Sunday morning show on Fox -
something that her previous employer was unwilling to offer her.

It is unclear when Bartirmo will make her Fox debut, but it
likely will not happen before January. Under her current contract, she is requited
to wait 60 days before appearing on a competing network.
