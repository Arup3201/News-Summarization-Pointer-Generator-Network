Holland will take to the field in the World Cup against Chile on Monday without their record goalscorer - and Robin van Persie's absence creates a curious stat for the Dutch football team.

When you think of the Dutch national side, you immediately think of the likes of Marco van Basten, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Edwin van der Sar.

Yet, for the first time in 221 matches, Oranje will line-up for a match without a player whose surname starts with 'Van'.

Vanless: Robin van Persie's (left) suspension means Holland will play without a 'Van' in their side

History: Holland coach Louis van Gaal (right) will field a side without a 'Van' in it for the first time in 221 games

Suspension: Van Persie's ban means there are no 'Vans' for Holland for the first time since May 29, 1996

Absent: Van Persie wipes his forehead during a training session at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo

Fitness: Rafael van der Vaart was forced to withdraw from Holland's World Cup squad through injury

Van Persie, who has scored 46 goals in 86 internationals, picked up a yellow card in each of Holland's matches with Spain and Australia, resulting in a one match ban.

And, as the Manchester United striker is the only 'Van' in their Brazil World Cup squad, Louis van Gaal's side will start with a vanless XI for the first time in 18 years.

The last time the Flying Dutchmen did not have a 'Van' on the field was when they beat China 2-0 on May 29, 1996.

Interestingly, Holland will still be managed by a 'Van' in the form of Van Gaal, but he will be unable to name any players bearing that name in his squad for the Chile encounter.

Edwin van der sar (goalkeeper) - 130 caps (1995-2008)

There can only be one choice in goal for this five-a-side team and it has to be Van der Sar.

During a glittering career he won the Champions League with both Ajax and Manchester United, as well as eight league titles.

He also holds the world league clean sheet record after going 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal for United during the 2008-09 season.

You wouldn't be scoring a lob past him, that's for sure...

Save: Van der Sar kept a world league clean sheet record of 1,311 minutes for Manchester United in 2008-09

Rafael van der Vaart (attacking midfielder) - 109 caps, 25 goals (2001-)

This five-a-side team is all about goals, goals and yet more goals. You'll find very little defending in it.

Van der Vaart is a wonderfully gifted midfielder who has played for Ajax, Hamburg, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur - and he can provide the assists for the deadly front three here.

He would have been in the Holland squad but a calf injury curtailed his involvement.

Will have to do all the tracking back in this side mind...

Creative: Rafael van der Vaart is an extremely skilful player who scores goals and provides assists

Robin van Persie (striker) - 86 caps, 46 goals (2005-)

What needs to be said about RVP that hasn't already?

The Manchester United striker is his country's record goalscorer with 46 goals and he has terrorised defences in the Premier League for years.

After banging goals in left, right and centre for Arsenal for no reward, he finally won a league title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-13.

Already has three goals at this World Cup, and expect more when he returns from his enforced rest.

Absence: Van Persie will not play against Chile on Monday after picking up two yellow cards

Amazing: Van Persie's opening goal of the tournament showed incredible improvisation for Holland

Ruud van Nistelrooy (striker) - 70 caps, 35 goals (1998-2011)

In our midfield/front three, RVP is accompanied by the deadly Dutch finisher that is Van Nistelrooy.

PSV Eindhoven, Real Madrid, Hamburg, Malaga and Manchester United were among the clubs for who Van Nistelrooy fired in endless goals, bringing him five league titles.

From inside the penalty area, has there ever been a finisher more clinical?

Expect very little movement around the court though...

Clinical: Ruud van Nistelrooy was a poacher who scored goals for fun throughout his career

Marco van Basten (striker) - 58 caps, 24 goals (1983-1992)

Six league titles, two European Cups and the 1988 European Championship hardly seem enough reward for a striker of such supreme talent.

Injury prematurely brought to an end a fantastic career for a player who shone on the field for Ajax, AC Milan and Oranje.

He scored 277 goals throughout his career and many of them spectacular, most memorably his volley against the USSR during the 1988 European Championship final in West Germany.

No team of 'Vans' would be complete without him, even if he is injured.

Expect truly special goals on the court from this man.

Class: Holland's Marco van Basten is one of the greatest strikers to have ever played the game

Simply the best: Van Basten's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion

Rafael van der Vaart's enforced World Cup absence due to a calf injury ensured that only Van Persie took to field as a 'Van'.

It is likely that Van Persie's absence will hit the Dutch hard as they face a Chile side who have taken the World Cup by storm.

Both teams head into the match with two wins from two games, and Van Persie's three goals have helped the Dutch dispose of Spain and Australia.

However, with Arjen Robben also having scored three times in Brazil already, Oranje do have another World Cup player at their disposal.

Holland only need a draw to top Group B, but a win for either side would set up a likely quarter-final tie with Mexico, whereas the loser would probably be forced to take on hosts Brazil.

The match takes place at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo.
