Journalist Samantha Brick has been on the receiving end of online abuse but believes the #TwitterSilence campaign was a waste of time

Sunday 4th August was a day to celebrate, not just because it was my youngest sister’s 20th birthday, but also because on a certain social network there was a distinct lack of the usual pompous, self-promoting prattle.

In case you missed it – then let me enlighten you: some of Britain’s foremost ‘twitterers’, who also happen to be ‘feminists’ (although their definition of the term seems to change by the day) had – in a spectacular paddy – decided to ‘protest’ against Twitter and not use it on Sunday 4th August. The reason? Certain opinion formers had received abusive Tweets and, even though Twitter had already caved into their demands of formulating an abuse button, forged ahead - galvanizing their followers with a 24 hour protest.

Heaven! This meant that they and their merry band of toadies would neither be indulging in the usual self-congratulatory claptrap or selling themselves via inane tweets for a whole 24 hours. The usual suspects who took part in '#twittersilence' – who primarily use the site to flog themselves and their god awful products - included Myleene Klass, Gok Wan, Kirstie Allsopp, Jenny Eclair and Richard Madeley.

Naturally a Twitter-lite Sunday was chosen for the ‘protest’ -  how on earth would those hallowed celebrities and writers truly cope if they couldn’t promote the usual tat and self-promoting baloney they persistently foist on us the other six days of the week?

You’d be forgiven for assuming that I too joined the hallowed ones in their protest – after all I’ve received death threats, crude insults and the like ever since I penned ‘that’ piece about being beautiful last year.

But you would be wrong if you presumed that I would entertain the silly season’s latest luvvie cause.

You see I don’t subscribe to the UK’s version of the ‘sisterhood’: I adore my husband, I’m proud of the fact he comes first in my life and I come first in his. I’m unrepentant of the fact that I prepare a meal for him every night in my spick and span home.

I could have joined in with the 'feminists' and listed my own impressive roll call of insults – but why bother? The ‘threats’ (truthfully they're just mindless prattle) are as likely to be acted on as I’m to be invited to ‘sups’ at Ms Moran’s house.

For it was Caitlin Moran who led the #twittersilence campaign. Lucky you if you don’t know who Ms Moran is! A ‘writer’, perhaps best known for wittering on about popular culture in a broadsheet and emphasising her point in SHOUTY CAPITALS (and I thought it was only my Dad – who left school at 14 – who resorted to such writing).

Ms Moran can do no wrong in the eyes of the chattering classes –Jemima Khan and her ilk. Naturally then, when she decided to take a stand against ‘twitter abuse’ she also encouraged her followers to do the same. This from a woman who has tweeted that Catholics 'hate women and gays and f*** kids'.

Moran and her ilk are, to my mind, little more than jumped up attention seekers desperate for a cause – and any ole cause will do. As for Mary Beard, I fear her university and broadcasting career have been eclipsed by her dogged whinnying about the threats she’s apparently received.

I don’t deny it - it’s horrible to be on the receiving end of such abuse. But I’ve performed my own reality checks in the past: is someone really going to announce on Twitter that they’re going to rape, bomb or do something to one or other of my bodily parts? Highly doubtful. Furthermore it’s a waste of public money to insist the authorities investigate such messages.

Which is why whenever I receive such missives I treat them with the contempt they deserve – deleting them and getting on with my life.

Tweet relief: Samantha and showbiz editor Dan Wootton were two journalists happy to see Caitlin and co. off Twitter for the day

Summer 2013 isn’t a period in time we’ll look back on as women with our heads held high.

The bonkers ‘project’  Everyday Sexism hasn't helped (which I have tweeted about – calling it the ‘he looked at me, therefore he wants to rape me’ website). And now this!

We women are in danger of replicating the mass hysteria last seen in the Salem Witch Trials. I’m ashamed right now to be a woman when I read some of the foul diatribe aimed at men.

Why? Because stunts like this really do prove that we are the weaker sex.

Was Twitter any the worse for the lack of celebrity posturing yesterday? Was it filled with abuse? No, it wasn’t.

In fact many of Moran's happy band continued to tweet and retweet throughout the day - laughably undermining their objective.

As for yesterday's 'campaign', channelling the spirit of Caitlin Moran I have this to say: ‘#twittersilence? TWITTER FAIL DUDE.
