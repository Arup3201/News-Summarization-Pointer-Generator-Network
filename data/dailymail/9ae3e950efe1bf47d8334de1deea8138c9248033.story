Police are refusing to name suspects they have charged with criminal offences.

Warwickshire Police announced yesterday that it would not name suspects as it charged one of its own former officers with the theft of £113,000 from the force’s former headquarters.

A short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said: ‘Due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge.’

It is a long-standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence. Until recently, they would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked.

But following the Leveson report into Press standards, forces have begun rolling back the public’s right to know who is being arrested.

To the horror of free speech campaigners, senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the Press and public being told the identity of anyone arrested.

However, the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the judicial system in a cloak of secrecy.

The naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and who will stand trial in court –  is widely seen as an essential bulwark against arbitrary arrest and detention.

Last night critics condemned  the Warwickshire force’s decision, branding it an extension of the ‘secret state’.

Tory MP Philip Davies, an influential member of the Commons culture committee, said: ‘This is completely and utterly unacceptable.

‘This kind of secret state that they are trying to encourage goes against all our freedoms and traditions in this country.’

‘The Government really needs to stop this in its tracks before it gets out of control.’

Freedom of speech campaigners said the decision not to name a former police officer charged with a crime was ‘extremely worrying’.

Index on Censorship chief executive Kirsty Hughes said: ‘Keeping secret the names of people who have been charged with crimes goes against the principle of open justice that we have in this country.

‘Although there may be instances when it is appropriate not to release a name, this should not be a general policy.

‘That the police have decided not to name a former police officer is extremely worrying.’

Last night the Warwickshire force’s acting deputy chief constable Neil Brunton defended the policy.

He denied the new secrecy had  anything to do with the fact that it was a former officer who had  been charged.

He said: ‘The policy was recently changed to align with national policy post-Leveson and not because of today’s outcome.’

Lord Justice Leveson’s report called for a ban on the Press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested.

The report said: ‘Save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public) the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or public.’

In the wake of the report, senior police officers have drawn up guidelines to apply to all forces which would ban them from confirming the names of suspects to journalists.

In the coming weeks, the Association of Chief Police Officers will publish detailed policy designed to bring the draconian new rules into force.

The plan is opposed by the Law Commission, the Government’s  own adviser on legal reform, which has said it is in the interests of  justice that the police name those arrested, except in very exceptional circumstances.

Last month, two senior judges backed the ‘secret arrests’ policy. Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Tugendhat said arrest could cause ‘irremediable damage to the person’s reputation’.

Only in exceptional circumstances should details of those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public, they said.

Even before the full rules are in use, some forces are already operating under the new practice.Critics of the ACPO plan say it undermines open justice. The step taken by Warwickshire to not name even those who are charged was unheard of until last night.

In its press release, the force said the accused man is a 54-year-old from the Stratford area. It said it would give the individual’s surname to journalists the day before he appears before Leamington magistrates on May 22.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
