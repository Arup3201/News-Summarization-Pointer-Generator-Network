Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has faced criticism for toasting champagne after signing a refugee deal with Cambodia, a country described as 'one of the poorest and most corrupt in the world'. 

The four-year deal, signed on Friday night with Cambodia's Interior Minister Sar Kheng, will allow Australia to send refugees currently detained on the Pacific island of Nauru to  Cambodia.

Mr Morrison said it would be up to Cambodia to determine when it accepts the refugees and how many but hopes voluntary resettlement will begin later this year.

The memorandum of understanding has  been criticised as pointless and expensive, as Australia is required to provide support for housing, education and health as well as language training to refugees.

Australia will give Cambodia $40 million in extra assistance over the next four years in return. 

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young described the deal as 'dirty' and a 'fundamental failure'. She said it was $40 million bribe to a corrupt government that will unleash human misery.

'On budget night we had Joe Hockey dancing, and now we have Scott Morrison popping champagne corks after signing a dirty deal with one of the most corrupt and poorest nations on Earth,' Senator Sarah Hanson-Young told reporters on Saturday.

'It's crass, it's sickening.'

Mr Morrison brushed off criticism, saying the toast was standard protocol in Cambodia.

'I'm not going to disrespect my host,' Mr Morrison said. 

The opposition has labelled the deal a complete farce that will see only a handful of refugees resettled.

'It is no wonder Scott Morrison refused to answer questions (at the signing),' opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said.

Up to 1000 asylum-seekers currently on Nauru who are deemed to be genuine refugees will be given the opportunity to resettle in Cambodia 

The United Nations refugee agency says it is 'deeply concerned at the precedent' and has urged Australia to reconsider.

'It's crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere,' UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said on Friday. 

Amnesty International said the agreement was a 'worrying departure from international norms', Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'In January the Australian government condemned Cambodia's human rights record at a UN human rights hearing, but will now relocate vulnerable refugees, possibly including children, to the country,' said Rupert Abbott, the Deputy Asia-Pacific Director at Amnesty International.

About 100 people protested outside the Australian embassy.

'(Cambodia) couldn't give humanitarian support even if we wanted to ... Cambodia is poor as hell,' Ou Virak, chairman of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, told AP. 

The condemnation comes just after the federal government confirmed that a 15-year-old asylum seeker girl who allegedly attempted self-harm was evacuated to Australia from Nauru detention centre. 

Mr Morrison was reportedly 20 minutes late to Friday's ceremony that saw Australia's Immigration Minister and Minister Sar Kheng toast to their deal, The Age reports.  

In a statement, Mr Morrison said 'a number of those found to be in genuine need of protection will now have the opportunity and support to re-establish their lives free from persecution'. 

Cambodian officials have said they might only start off with five refugees, but Mr Morrison downplayed such reports saying Phnom Penh had made a 'very strong commitment'.

'What Cambodia is saying, and we agree with them, is that you have to start off small, make sure the program is working, and then build it up over time,' he told the ABC on Saturday. 

In Australia, about 70 protesters chanting 'free the refugees' and 'freedom, azadi' gathered along the perimeter fence of the Brisbane Immigration Transit Centre at Pinkenba. 

UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, said 'it's crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere'
