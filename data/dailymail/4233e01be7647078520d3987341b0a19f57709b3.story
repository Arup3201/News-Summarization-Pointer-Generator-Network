A government health campaign to get people to stop eating cheese has been condemned as 'unbelievably stupid' by farming ministers who fear for the impact on Britain's dairy industry.

A Whitehall row has erupted over the Department of Health campaign designed to encourage people to cut down the amount of  saturated fats in their diet.

The controversial Smart Swaps campaign has also faced criticism for giving money-off vouchers for fizzy drinks and ready meals.

The Smart Swaps campaign urges people to give up full-fat food and drink for healthy alternatives

The Department of Health-backed scheme gives money off low-fat snacks

The Smart Swaps campaign was launched by Change4Life, run by Public Health England, last month.

It encourages people to switch from unhealthy food and drink to low fat, low sugar alternatives.

People who sign up are sent money off vouchers, fridge magnets and a ‘Smart Swapper’ wheel containing advice on how to eat more healthily.

The advice includes using 'reduced fat cheese' in several recipes, including pizzas, fish pie and even sandwiches. A magnet reads: 'Reduced fat cheese, if you please.'

But senior Tories in the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have warned that a planned poster 
campaign would alienate farmers, the dairy industry and the makers of 
full-fat cheese – including those in key marginal constituencies.

Farming minister George Eustice has complained to Jane Ellison, the public health minister, about the campaign.

A
 source said: ‘You could have had posters going up in farming areas that
 were badly flooded telling people to cut down on the amount of cheese 
they buy. It was unbelievably stupid.’

David Cameron's official spokesman today refused to get drawn into the dairy row.

'I don't make it my job to give people advice from here. Public health advice is made, including around dairy advice, and that I what I will stick to.

'My answer, whether it is hard, soft, crumbly or flaky, is to point you to the advice that exists,' he told a regular briefing of journalists.

Ministers clashed in Westminster over the Change4Life campaign which calls on people to switch to skimmed milk and buy reduced-fat cheese

The Government last night denied 
saying that cheese  was ‘bad’, and said it remained supportive of 
Britain's £10 billion dairy industry.

The
 Department of Health said: ‘The Change4Life Smart Swaps campaign… does 
not suggest that dairy is bad for you. The smart swaps campaign includes
 five recommended smart swaps, one of which was switching to low fat 
cheese.

‘We are clear 
that milk and cheese can be enjoyed as part of a healthy and balanced 
diet which also supports the UK’s £10billion dairy industry employing 
more than 5,000 people.’

It comes amid a growing debate over whether saturated fats are actually harmful. 

Earlier
 this month researchers at Cambridge University said that giving up 
fatty meat, cream or butter was unlikely to improve health.

Earlier this month MailOnline revealed how the Smart Swaps campaign had come under fire for giving free advertising to junk food firms.

Shoppers were being offered money off fizzy drinks, tinned vegetables and ready 
meals with vouchers sent to more than 100,000 people who want to improve
 their diet.

The government was accused of ‘endorsing’ companies like Pepsi and 
Uncle Ben’s while 'doing nothing' to tackle the nation’s obesity crisis.
