It was a heart-melting discovery of a lost love letter written 68 years ago.

Addressed to 'dearest darling Hilda' from gunner Eric Winspear, each page was affectionately marked with kisses instead of numbers and detailed the excitement of the couple's impending marriage.

Upon finding the seven-page note in a donated handbag, an Adelaide op shop owner Jacqui Dodd was on a mission to return the piece of sentiment to Hilda who after all these years had kept the intimate letter.

'Gosh it makes me pinch myself to find out that I'm not dreaming dear, as I cant believe it is really true that you are going to be my wife,' Mr 

Mr Winspear wrote the letter whilst he was serving as part of the peace keeping forces in Palestine at the time

The date was June 7, 1946 when Mr Winspear - who was part of the British peace keeping forces in Palestine - penned the heartfelt letter to his fiance, Nine Network's Today reports.

'I hope you've noticed the date on this letter sweetheart,' he wrote.

'It's a year to the date when we get married and when we will always belong to each other no matter what happens darling.

'Gosh it makes me pinch myself to find out that I'm not dreaming dear, as I can't believe it is really true that you are going to be my wife.' 

Despite the distance that separated the pair, the undying love Mr Winspear had for his fiance was very clear.

'I hope things will turn out for us when we settle down in our own little home. We will have a good time being together all the time and going to dances,' he continued.

'Keep smiling my darling and don't forget if my letters are long or short, I still love you all the same as I always have done and always will do.'

It was a tearful moment for Hilda Winspear, now 87, when the letter was returned to her

Mr and Mrs Winspear married on June 7, 1947 - exactly a year after the love letter was written

After the couple married, they moved to Australia in 1970

Together they raised four children and were married for 66 years

Mr Winspear died at the age of 90 in January this year and Mrs Winspear is currently in a nursing home

'I couldn't have got a better man, no matter where I'd gone,' Mrs Winspear said of her late husband

Ms Dodd of Adra Op Shop, of Parafield which is north of Adelaide, told Daily Mail Australia that she couldn't believe it when she found the letter three weeks ago.

'We got goosebumps because this isn't something you find everyday,' she said.

'And we wanted to return it to Hilda because we knew that it would mean a lot to her.

'It obviously had a lot of sentimental value considering that she kept it with her for about 67 years.'

Ms Dodd believes Mrs Winspear's handbag, which was where the letter found, was donated to the shop about six months ago after Mr Winspear died.

The couple's eldest daughter Sheila Shaw, 66, who told Daily Mail Australia that she was very emotional when she first saw the letter.

'I'm very pleased she got the letter back because it was something that mum treasured,' she said. 

Owner of Adra Op Shop, Jacqui Dodd, said she had 'goosebumps' when she found the love letter

The note was found inside a pocket of a donated handbag about three weeks ago

It was a tearful moment for Hilda Winspear, now 87 and at a nursing home, when she saw the recovered letter.

'I couldn't have got a better man, no matter where I'd gone,' Mrs Winspear told Today. 

Evidently it was a precious piece of memory for Mrs Winspear who did marry the love of her life, exactly a year after the letter was written.

'They first met at a dance before the war and their romance blossomed from there,' Ms Shaw told Daily Mail Australia.

'They were a very loving couple who did everything together including a tour around Australia for 15 years in a caravan in the mid-90s.'

Together the couple went on to raise four children and moved from Britain to Australia in 1970.

'Dad was a very affectionate man and he loved writing letters so he was the one that kept in touch with everyone back home when we moved to Australia,' Ms Shaw said. 

The couple were married for 66 years until Mr Winspear died on January 29 at the age of 90.
