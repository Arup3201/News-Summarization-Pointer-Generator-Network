A Chinese man has had a new nose grown on his forehead.

The man, who has only been named as Xiaolian, had the treatment to create a replacement for his original nose which was infected and deformed.

Xiaolian, 22, had a new nose grown on his forehead after his original one was irreparably damaged in a traffic accident. The new nose was sculpted from cartilage taken from his ribs

The procedure was carried out at a hospital in Fuzhou, Fujian province.

The 22-year-old damaged his nose in a traffic accident in August 2012 but failed to seek treatment.

As a result, an infection corroded the cartilage leaving the surgeons unable to repair it.

They were left with no choice but to grow him a new nose and then to transplant it in place of his damaged one. 

Doctors say that they will soon be able to carry out a transplant operation to replace the damaged nose with the newly grown one

The nose was created by placing a skin tissue expander onto Xiaolian’s forehead.

This was cut into the shape of a nose and was supported by cartilage taken from the man’s ribs.

Surgeons say that the nose has developed well and that the transplant surgery will be carried out soon.
