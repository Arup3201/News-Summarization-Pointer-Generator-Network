An Alice Springs couple that ditched five children and a baby kangaroo in a car for more than two hours in 40-degree heat so it could gamble and drink have dodged prosecution.

The children, one of whom was just two years old, were freed from the car unharmed, but the joey had died by the time emergency services arrived.

The incident is still to be investigated by the Department of Children and Families. 

A couple that left five children and a kangaroo joey alone in a car for more than two hours has avoided prosecution.

Alice Springs police said the witnesses who spotted the car were the reason the incident avoided a 'far worse', tragic ending.

Police first responded to calls about 'children trapped' about 1:30pm on Tuesday.

'Upon attendance, police located five children aged between two and 13 years who had been left in the car for over two hours,' Commander Chris Wilson said, according to the NT News.

Police were alerted to the incident by passersby about 1:30pm, as the temperature soared into the forties. 

Kidsafe NT executive director Victoria Pollifrone said the scare should be serve as a wake up call and a catalyst for a change to state laws.

'The children were checked by St John Ambulance staff while the two adults looking after the kids were located inside the licensed premises.'

Paramedics at the scene cleared the children of having suffered any harm.

Kidsafe NT executive director Victoria Pollifrone said the scare should be serve as a wake up call and a catalyst for a change to state laws.

'If this legislation was introduced, it would be obvious it's illegal (to leave children in a car) and passers-by would be more likely to intervene,' Ms Pollifrone said.
