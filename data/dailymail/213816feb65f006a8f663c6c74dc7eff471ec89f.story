Lifetime has released the first trailer for its controversial new reality series Born in the Wild, which follows a group of pregnant women who abandon traditional hospital and home births in favor of having their babies out in the wild, miles away from the nearest medical facility.   

The trailer introduces two mothers who have chosen to pursue this ultimate style of natural birth, with one being carried out into the woods during labor, and another choosing to go through the entire process while camped out in a makeshift cabin in rural Alaska. 

And while the show has come under fire from medical experts who claim it will start a 'dangerous trend' that will see more mothers attempting to give birth without the help of doctors or midwives, its stars insist their choice of birthing method is actually one of the safest - and most enjoyable.

Natural birth: Lifetime's new reality series Born in the Wild follows a group of pregnant women who abandon traditional hospital births in favor of having their babies out in the middle of nowhere

Little miracle: Producers insisted that no first time mothers were allowed to take part in the show

'The main problem I had with my first birth is my choices weren’t respected,' mother-of-three Audrey Bird, 25, whose six-month-old daughter Piper was born in front of the cameras outside of the family home in rural Alaska, told the New York Post.

'I said, "I don’t want IV lines, I want to be able to move, be able to walk, I don’t want to be strapped down to the bed or tied to a monitor."

'The nurses at that time... were very argumentative and as soon as I proved any resistance to what they wanted to do, they treated me disrespectfully and they introduced a lot of fear to me that wasn’t necessary.' 

Audrey, whose husband Peter fully supported her decision to pursue a totally natural birth, is actually a trained midwife and gave birth to her second child while at home, without the help of any other doctors or nurses. 

Isolated: Audrey Bird, from Alaska, opted to give birth to her third child Piper in a makeshift cabin built by her husband

Trained professional: The 25-year-old is a midwife and therefore chose not to have any other doctors or nurses present at the birth

Into the wild: The family asked a nearby medevac team, located 30 minutes away from their home, to be on standby in case of an emergency

She admits that giving birth out in the wild, without the safety of a totally-sterile environment, didn't worry her because she completely 'trusted her body', her husband and her training to ensure her baby would be born without any complications. 

Lifetime producers offered the Birds the opportunity to have a medical professional on-hand in case of any medical emergencies, but Audrey declined, opting instead to have a ask a medevac team located 30 minutes away from their home to be on standby should anything go wrong. 

'I’ve attended many births, dealt with many complications. We were very prepared, we didn’t anticipate anything going wrong that we couldn’t handle,' she added. 

While announcing the launch of the series back in June, Lifetime's senior VP Eli Lehrer told Entertainment Weekly that executives working on the show were taking 'extreme precautions to make sure the mothers and babies were safe' throughout the filming process. 

Mother and child: Audrey and her husband Peter welcomed a healthy baby girl 

Trust: The mother-of-three was completely confident in 'her body and her husband'

He added: 'Our presence at these births is going to make them far safer than if they were doing it on their own.' 

But the series has already come under fire from critics who insist that Born in the Wild will inspire many more pregnant women to follow in the footsteps of its stars - but without the help and support of a professional production team.

'I understand everybody wants to believe we over-medicalize pregnancy and that it's a natural process,' maternal-fetal specialist Ron Jaekle told Entertainment Weekly. 

'But it's a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life.'
