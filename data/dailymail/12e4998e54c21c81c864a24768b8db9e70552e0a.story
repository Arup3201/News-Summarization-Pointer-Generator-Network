John Terry had some words of comfort for disgruntled Chelsea fans after Jose Mourinho slammed the Stamford Bridge atmosphere. 

Blues fan Joe Davies sent a lengthy message to the captain’s Instagram account expressing his disappointment at the manager, highlighting a number of his problems with the club’s attitude towards supporters. 

Terry replied by requesting 18-year-old Davies’ phone number to give his side of the story. Davies said the skipper then rang him on Monday morning.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Stamford Bridge was so quiet it was like playing at an empty stadium

Fans have hit back at the Chelsea boss, saying he had crossed the line and his comments were out of order 

'I was so shocked and excited when he replied to me,' Davies told Sportsmail. 'I couldn’t believe I would be talking to my hero, I never thought in a million years he would actually ring.

'He told me that fans shouldn't take any of Mourinho's comments to heart. Jose only said it to get a reaction, he does the same to the players all the time. Terry called Mourinho the "main man".

'I can't believe how much of a legend Terry is to call me.'

Mourinho has risked tarnishing his hero status by criticising the lack of vocal backing during the win against QPR on Saturday, with some of the club’s most loyal fans claiming he has overstepped the mark.

Mourinho said Stamford Bridge was like ‘an empty stadium,’ a comment that hit a nerve with those who fear they are being priced out of games and discouraged from properly getting behind the team by the club’s aggressive no-standing policy.

‘Jose shouldn’t have done that, he is out of order,’ said David Johnstone, spokesman for the fanzine cfcuk.

‘I love him to bits but he has made us look like mugs. We’ve already met twice with the club to talk about finding ways to improve the atmosphere.’

Last season, Johnstone was among those who organised a collection to pay Mourinho’s £8,000 FA fine for stepping onto the pitch at Aston Villa, but they have been offended by this episode.

Another point of contention concerns warning letters received by some fans, who have threatened to withdraw season tickets because they have been identified as persistent standers during games by stewards and security officials using CCTV.

Terry spoke with 18-year-old fan Davies, who made contact via social media to tell the Chelsea captain Mourinho had been ‘bang out of order’ and urge him to back the supporters. Davies said Terry promised to help when he called him.

‘I understand Jose’s point,’ added Johnstone. ‘Chelsea are top of the league and fans should sing for 100 minutes, let alone 90. But the culture in English football has changed and some fans who come into the ground now are more interested in taking selfies than getting behind the team.

‘If we were winning four or five-nil he wouldn’t have said anything, but when he sees us struggling against a team second from bottom, he lets himself down. I know what he can be like.’

It was a full house at Stamford Bridge for the visit of west London rivals QPR
