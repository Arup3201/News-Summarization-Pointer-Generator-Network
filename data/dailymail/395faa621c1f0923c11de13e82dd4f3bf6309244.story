Parts of the country are having their bins collected only once every three weeks.

Households in Gwynedd yesterday became the first in Wales to some have some of their bins emptied on a three weekly basis.

It comes after Bury Council became the first in Britain to make the controversial move earlier this month.

The Labour-led authority in Greater Manchester said it would save £800,000 a year and boost recycling rates to 60 per cent in the borough. It believes that many will follow its lead.

Its grey bin for general household rubbish, green bin for paper and cardboard, and blue bin for glass, plastic bottles and cans are all now collected every three weeks.

The brown bin for garden and food waste is still collected every two weeks.

In Gwynedd it is just general household rubbish that is being switched to three weekly collection.

Food waste and recyclable products will still be collected weekly.

Gwynedd council approved the plan in April despite protests from residents. The council said it would save it £350,000 a year as well as reducing landfill waste and encouraging recycling.

Bury Council said: ‘It will save a fortune especially in landfill tax fines. Since we moved to fortnightly grey bins in 2011, our recycling rate has shot up from 27% to 47%.

‘We’re spending £10m a year treating and disposing of waste that can’t be recycled.’

But fears have been raised by residents over bad smells and vermin problems,

Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said there was ‘absolutely no case’ for the cuts and backs weekly collections.

Conservative MP Mr Hopkins said: ‘This government is working with councils to support weekly rubbish and recycling collections which protect the local environment and public health.’

He said near-monthly collections would ‘encourage fly-tipping, backyard burning and harm local amenity.

‘Our research has comprehensively shown councils can deliver savings through better procurement, more joint working and adopting new technology.’

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles has previously said that every English resident should expect weekly bin collections, let alone fortnightly or every three weeks.

He said in 2012: ‘I believe it’s a fundamental right for every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected.’

Bury council said: ‘It has been claimed changes would cause flies or maggots but brown bins for food and garden waste will continue to be collected every two weeks.’
