It's been nearly six months since Danica Weeks lost the love of her life.

What happened to him? Where did he go? Is he dead? Or could he possibly be alive?

These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered not just for Paul Weeks' wife but also their two little boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1.

How can life go on when all a grieving family has to go by are the conspiracy theories about how a plane somehow disappeared off the face of the earth.

In an interview with Anne Barrowclough, for The Weekend Australian Magazine, the Perth mother-of-two spoke of her continual disbelief and utter despair ever since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mysteriously vanished on March 8.

All she's left with are the memories and his final parting gift - his wedding ring.

Danica Weeks still can't fathom how Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared and took away her husband on March 8

'Every morning I wake up and think, "How do you lose a plane?" I can't even begin to grieve yet,' Mrs Weeks said.

She waited for days, weeks and months - still, nothing.

Paul Weeks is among the 239 lost souls on the MH370 aircraft, which still remains missing

The 40-year-old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39-year-old husband was among the 239 lost souls when Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean.

This wasn't part of their grand plan - of moving to Perth, leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together.  

The couple first met 14 years ago at Oktoberfest in Munich. From then on, romance was born and they pair lived together in London for a couple of years until they relocated to Christchurch in New Zealand - Mr Weeks' hometown.

But following the earthquakes, they decided to make the move to Perth in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids.

On March 8, Mr Weeks boarded MH370 so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. 

His precious final moments are ingrained in Mrs Weeks' memories, as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site.

He requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second.

But for now, Mrs Weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck. 

'Every night now I go home and it's lonely, it’s very lonely. When you've had someone there for 14 years, how do you keep going when they're gone?'

Yet the grieving mother tries to keep it together, for the sake of her children.

And while Mrs Weeks herself isn't able to put piece the puzzle together herself, she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father.

For eldest son Lincoln, who's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever, he's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother.

Witnessing how the tragedy has affected her child, Mrs Weeks is determined more than ever to bring closure to all suffering families.

'That's why I won't rest until I find out what happened to Pauly. That's why I won't let [Malaysia Airlines] treat him like a seat number. I have to keep him alive. And I won't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane,' she said.

As for the second devastating Malaysia Airlines disaster, where a plane flying over the Russian-Ukraine conflict was shot down on July 17 and claimed 298 lives, the pain of loss and bewilderment hit too close to home for Mrs Week.

'Just feel so heart broken, all over again, for all the families of MH17,' she wrote on her Facebook.

On board the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were 12 crew members and 227 passengers

Meanwhile, the search continues for the doomed Boeing 777 as air crash investigators hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the aircraft within the next year.

The plane vanished with 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China.

Upon several failed aerial searches to spot any wreckage from the airliner,experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site.

Martin Dolan of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is leading the search and feels confident that he will be able to announce a smaller search area shortly based on satellite data and the use of flight simulators.

He said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings, although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft.

For MH17, operation 'Bring them Home' as seen the first bodies of Australian victims arrive back from Amsterdam to Melbourne.

This comes six weeks after Russian rebels reportedly shot down the flight by a missile, killing 15 crew members and 283 passengers  - among them 38 Australians.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has pledged to 'ensure that this horrific act is investigated and its perpetrators brought to justice'.
