As our best-known animal lover, the Queen has taken a keen interest in the mystery illness that has struck down dogs after they have been walked in woods on her Sandringham estate, killing at least eight of them.

Now, just as she prepares for her family Christmas at Sandringham, Her Majesty has received some welcome news.

The Queen, who asked scientists from the Animal Health Trust to investigate the canine illness, had warned dog walkers to be vigilant after her land became the worst hit area in the country.

Welcome news: The Queen had taken a keen interest in the mystery bug which had struck down the dogs

Her own dogs are equally at risk, including her corgis and the Labradors that pick up pheasants on her Boxing Day shoot.

The trust believes that the outbreak of so-called Seasonal Canine Illness, which affected 49 dogs exercised in woodland at Sandringham this autumn, appears to be over.

No new cases have been reported for more than a month, so the Queen can relax, knowing that royal shooting parties on the estate are no longer at risk.

The trust also believes it has discovered the cause, after a botanist from the Natural History Museum was able to rule out various theories.

There was no sign, I gather, that any plant or fungus was the cause following soil tests which proved negative. Instead, the trust now thinks the bug is linked to bites from an infestation of harvest mites.

It says that there have been 95 cases this year in five areas, including Sherwood and Thetford forests, but Sandringham was worst affected.

Two dogs walked on the royal estate this year have died, while six died last year. However, survival rates improved after the Queen ordered estate managers to put up signs warning dog owners to watch for symptoms.

Buckingham Palace has refused to say if the Queen has stopped walking her dogs on the estate because of the outbreak.

A spokeswoman says: ‘The Sandringham estate is taking  the reports of sick dogs very seriously.’

Next Labour leader? Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper appeared on The Andrew Marr Show last weekend

Fortune appears to be smiling on shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper: bookmakers have her as 3-1 favourite to succeed Ed Miliband as the next Labour leader.

She also has the seal of approval from multi-millionaire novelist Ken Follett and his  former Labour MP wife, Barbara. The Folletts bankrolled Cooper’s husband Ed Balls’s failed attempt to become party leader last year to the tune of £127,500.

With Balls’s chances of taking the top job all but sunk, they have now moved on to funding his wife. According to the latest register of MPs’ interests, Barbara gave Cooper £4,550 to help pay a member of staff.

Verbier bash: Holly Branson joined ber future husband on his stag do

Coming from such an unconventional family, it was perhaps not surprising that Holly Branson broke with tradition to celebrate her hen night.

For rather than being parted from fiancé Freddie Andrews, he came along too for his stag night.

The daughter of Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson flew with shipbroker Freddie to Switzerland at the weekend for a lavish party at her father’s luxury ski lodge in upmarket Verbier — along with 26 friends.

All the girls wore matching T-shirts — but, fortunately for Holly, she was spared the usual embarrassment of a hen do when the suitcase containing her party kit was lost.

‘It was such a pity Holly’s hen bag didn’t turn up,’ I am told.

‘There were a few surprises in there.’

The group boarded a coach at Geneva airport and were whisked to Sir Richard’s nine-bedroom chalet, which rents out at £99,800 a week at the height of the skiing season.

The retreat has 13 full-time staff, including a Raymond Blanc-trained chef.

Although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are close friends of the couple, they were not at the jollities.

Freddie and Holly are due to wed on Necker, Branson’s privately-owned Caribbean island, this month.

Joanna Lumley and her former husband Jeremy Lloyd will be reunited on 
stage at the Royal Albert Hall

The last time actor and writer Jeremy Lloyd and Joanna Lumley, his former wife, worked together was in a 1971 TV series. David Croft, who helped with the script, was persuaded on-set by Lloyd to do a sitcom based in a department store. The rest is history as Lloyd and Croft’s comedy classic Are You Being Served? is still shown in more than 50 countries.

On Sunday, Lloyd and Lumley will be reunited on stage at the Royal Albert Hall for a charity production of Captain Beaky & His Band, the poetry Lloyd set to music in 1977. The 80-year-old will be introduced on stage by Lumley. ‘It felt like we were married for ten minutes, but it was for a year,’ he says. ‘Joanna wrote that maybe we shouldn’t have got married, and just had an affair instead.

‘But I don’t regret it for a second and we have remained great friends.’ 

And Lloyd is clearly still on good terms with Charlotte Rampling, to whom he was engaged for three years: she is travelling from her home in Paris for the show.

Tribute: Poppy Floyd, daughter of Keith Floyd, is developing a television tribute to her late father

More than two years after the death of maverick celebrity chef Keith Floyd, his daughter Poppy, 27, is developing a television tribute to her late father. 

Hard-living Floyd died on the same night a less-than-flattering Channel 4 documentary was screened about him — a film that upset his family and friends. 

Floyd’s manager Stan Green tells me 
plans are afoot for Poppy — from Keith’s second marriage to Julie 
Hatcher — to front a show, Floyd On Floyd, celebrating her father’s 
eventful career. ‘She’s very much her father’s daughter,’ says Green. 
‘She’s like a little Keith, but only with his nice side!

‘I’ve
long thought we needed a programme that actually celebrates Keith’s 
career and Poppy is the perfect person to do it. When I approached her, 
she thought it was a great idea.’

He
adds: ‘Poppy is a trained architect, not a cook. But she will be 
visiting the places her father went to during his career, re-telling his
stories and adventures.’

Architectural historian Gavin Stamp is furious with architect Lord Foster, who used an Oxford University lecture to attack Heathrow airport as unviable (Foster wants it sold off and turned into housing).

Of course, it just so happens that Foster, 75, is promoting his own proposals for a new four-runway airport in the Thames estuary which would earn his company several millions.

Professor Stamp is unimpressed: ‘Am I alone in getting rather tired of that distinguished tax exile Lord Foster pontificating from his Swiss eyrie on how London should be re-planned — always with megalomaniac schemes requiring the benevolent intervention of some large architectural practice such as his own?’

PS What has Radio 4 presenter Libby Purves got against biographer Sarah Bradford? Yesterday, Purves used her newspaper column to take aim at the author, who has a new royal book out, after Bradford’s admission that she was possibly mistaken to have once written that Prince Philip had been unfaithful.

‘No indication of an apology to the husband of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England for suggesting he broke the seventh Commandment,’ she thundered.

Bradford insists she and Purves have no history of hostility. ‘I’ve not met her and have nothing against her,’ she says. ‘The whole thing made me laugh. I’m an innocent bystander.’
