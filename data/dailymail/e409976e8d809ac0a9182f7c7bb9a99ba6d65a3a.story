Theresa May is to be hauled before MPs to face questions over what she knew about a damaging letter leaked by her closest aide to undermine Michael Gove.

The Home Secretary – who is seen as a Tory leadership contender – will be asked about her role in the ‘unseemly’ public feud with the Education Secretary over how Islamist extremism is tackled in schools.

She will be asked about any personal involvement in the release of a letter she wrote to Mr Gove raising concerns about his department’s response to allegations of a plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham.

Home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz has called Home Secretary Theresa May to give evidence in Parliament after the deeply damaging row led to the resignation of her close aide, Fiona Cunningham

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home 
affairs select committee, said he had written to Mrs May to demand a 
full investigation into what had happened. He also revealed that her 
special adviser Fiona Cunningham, who was forced to resign on Saturday 
night, could be called to give evidence.

Labour’s
 Yvette Cooper yesterday stepped up pressure on the Government by 
accusing the Home Secretary of breaching the ministerial code that sets 
out the standards of conduct for those in government.

Mr Cameron is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ over the row between two key Cabinet figures.

There
 will be concerns in Mrs May’s camp that the questions over her conduct 
could harm her leadership ambitions, and she is known to be furious that
 she has lost Miss Cunningham – one of her most loyal and trusted 
advisers.

Last night, 
Whitehall sources suggested that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood 
may have already concluded that Mrs May did not know about the letter’s 
publication because he only told Mr Gove to apologise.

The
 bitter row started late last Tuesday when comments published in The 
Times from an unnamed source – made by Mr Gove during a lunch at the 
newspaper – criticised Home Office counter-terrorism chief Charles 
Farr’s approach to preventing the spread of extremism.

Within
 hours of the story appearing, a letter Mrs May previously sent to Mr 
Gove questioning his department’s response to the Islamist ‘Trojan 
horse’ allegations in Birmingham schools was placed on the Home Office 
website by Miss Cunningham.

This
 was a confidential item of Cabinet correspondence and should not have 
been released. A Home Office aide also briefed against Mr Gove to the 
BBC on Wednesday morning.

Furious that Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech had been overshadowed, David Cameron ordered Sir Jeremy to carry out an inquiry.

It
 led to Miss Cunningham taking the blame for the letter and resigning on
 Saturday night. Mr Gove wrote to apologise to the Prime Minister and Mr
 Farr. It is unclear if he will also be forced to apologise to the 
Commons.

Although the 
Education Secretary will face a rough ride in the House today when he 
publishes 21 reports by Ofsted into the Birmingham schools affair, it is
 Mrs May who is facing more questions over her conduct.

Mr
 Vaz said: ‘I have written to the Home Secretary for a full explanation 
of what has happened. The committee will question her about these 
matters. There is a strong case to hear from Ms Cunningham herself as to
 why she has resigned.

David Cameron will reshuffle his Cabinet in the next ten days – and is expected to use the opportunity to promote women.

Employment minister Esther McVey, who impressed the Prime Minister with her defence of benefit reforms, is among those being tipped for the top table.

The Liverpudlian was a presenter on Children’s BBC and GMTV before becoming an MP. She was also a successful businesswoman, setting up the firm Making It UK, which provides training for small businesses.

However, she has a majority of just 2,436 in her constituency of Wirral West. Children’s minister Liz Truss and women’s minister Nicky Morgan could also be promoted.

Long-serving Cabinet ministers who may have to make way for a female influx include Andrew Lansley, the Leader of the Commons, who could become Britain’s next European commissioner.

Chief Whip Sir George Young and Ken Clarke – the veteran minister without portfolio – may also go.

Despite their public row over extremism in schools, both Education Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May are expected to keep their jobs.

‘This unseemly row obscures the pressing issue of how to combat radicalism in schools.

‘Theresa
 May must also ensure that in the future there are no potential 
conflicts of interests that may impact on her decision-making.’

Miss
 Cooper said Mrs May needed to explain her actions, including whether 
she breached the ministerial code, which states that ministers should 
not leak confidential letters between members of the Government.

She
 told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We’ve seen the Education Secretary 
apologise, the special adviser to the Home Secretary resign, but we’ve 
heard nothing from the Home Secretary even though it looks clear that 
she has breached the ministerial code by writing and then authorising 
the publication of this letter.

‘The
 Prime Minister is responsible for enforcing the ministerial code. He 
needs to act and to make sure that that happens. Theresa May needs to 
come out publicly and answer what she did to publish this letter.’

Labour says Miss Cunningham should not receive the substantial severance pay to which she may be entitled after losing her job.

Jonathan
 Ashworth, Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘If she has been 
awarded severance pay this would amount to £37,000, which is the maximum
 possible and £10,000 above the average wage. This would be considered 
unacceptable in light of the circumstances of her departure.’

Last night Downing Street was unable to say whether any payment had been made.

Pupils as young as six were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’ by a school at the centre of the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot.

The shocking disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims Muslim radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of Birmingham schools.

A leaked copy of one report says teachers at Oldknow Academy told school inspectors they were alarmed by the use of terms such as ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ in school assemblies, and that non-Muslim teachers were banned from being present.

A report by the Education Funding Agency says: ‘We were told by teachers that non-Muslim teaching staff are no longer allowed to take Friday assemblies. In separate interviews, staff told us that in Friday assemblies, occasionally words have been used such as “white prostitute” and  “hellfire” which they felt were inappropriate for young children.’

Well-placed sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the term ‘white prostitute’ was used to suggest to pupils that Muslim women were moral but non-Muslim women were not.

Oldknow Academy, which has around 600 pupils, is said to have been the subject of a gradual takeover by extremists, who allegedly pushed out head teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school.

Officially, Mrs Kondal is on sick leave, and she refused to discuss the matter with The Mail on Sunday.

She was among four of the school’s six senior managers who have left in recent months.

It is also claimed that in one assembly, just before Christmas last year, a senior teacher led ‘an anti-Christian’ chant. He allegedly shouted at the pupils ‘Do we believe in Christmas?’, to which the pupils replied collectively ‘No we don’t.’

The senior teacher is said to have made other ‘anti-Christian comments’ at the same assembly. 

Officials from education watchdog Ofsted, who have also studied the ‘Trojan Horse’ claims, investigated the ‘anti-Christmas’ chant incident, but found no evidence of it.

However, a source said that teachers and pupils at Oldknow have referred to Christians as ‘kaffirs’, a derogatory Arabic term meaning infidels.

The source said that as part of the Islamic takeover, urinals from the boy’s toilets were removed, in accordance with Muslim custom which frowns on those who stand up to urinate.

More than 95 per cent of Oldknow’s pupils are Muslim. It holds Islamic prayers every Friday, teaches Arabic and organises trips to Mecca.

Last week, Oldknow teacher, Samir Rauf defended the school, accusing Ofsted inspectors of ‘having an agenda’. He said he had seen no evidence of an extremist takeover, and denied Christmas had been banned.

In February, a senior Oldknow teacher is said to have posted a message on social media urging all Muslims to disown those who gave up their faith.

He said: ‘Do not love the one who does not love Allah. If they can leave Allah, they will leave you.’

Only a year ago, an Ofsted inspection of Oldknow found it ‘outstanding’ in all areas, including in promoting multi-racial harmony.

It is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is expected to put five schools into special measures when the reports are published tomorrow. He will make a Commons statement as head teachers hold a press conference in Birmingham to speak publicly for the first time.

According to a leaked report, teachers at the school lead chants criticising Christmas

The five schools include Oldknow, and secondary schools Park View and Golden Hillock. The running and teaching at all three have been described as ‘inadequate.’

Ofsted inspectors criticise poor teaching at Golden Hillock, and in their report say: ‘Too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views.’

The school, which has just under 900 pupils, is said to have been taken over by extremists with an ‘Islamising agenda.’ Former head teacher Matthew Scarrott reportedly left because he opposed the change.

Ofsted say Golden Hillock did not provide adequate sex education and that some female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘intimidating’.

The school did little to ‘mitigate against cultural isolation,’ leaving students ‘vulnerable to the risk  of marginalisation from wider British society and the associated risks, which could include radicalisation’.

However Mohammed Shafique, chairman of governors at Golden Hillock, said he would challenge any move to put the school into special measures: ‘Ofsted’s views are completely unfounded, we do not practise isolationism or segregation. They did not check the reality on the ground. They were listening to comments Michael Gove made.’

At Park View, it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil, given lists of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them and that staff preach ‘mind-blowing’ anti-Western propaganda in assemblies.
