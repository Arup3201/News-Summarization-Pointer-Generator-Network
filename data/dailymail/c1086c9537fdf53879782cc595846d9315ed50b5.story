Sunday night’s legal drama Law & Order: UK conjures images of pulsating glamour, where barristers duel with words across hallowed courtrooms.

They are defending the very fabric of civilisation, even as they’re falling in love with their bitterest opponents.

Here’s the reality, on The Briefs (ITV): a bearded solicitor in a horsehair wig sucks at a ciggie on the steps of a magistrates’ court in Manchester.

Not so glamorous: The Briefs offers viewers an insight into British justice from the perspective of the defence

Ahalf-smile of weariness flickers through the fag smoke — he’s seen it all, and he knows there’s not a shred of romance anywhere in the system.

It’s a tawdry, depressing treadmill. Nearly three-quarters of the defendants who get legal aid from law firm Tuckers are repeat offenders.

Some of them return dozens of times: one youth on a charge of armed robbery has been a Tuckers client since he was 11 — ten years later, he was ready for his 36th court appearance.

He didn’t seem to think he had done anything wrong, though his solicitor reproved him: ‘If you brandish an  axe in a public place, that would constitute a breach of your Asbo.’

The youth walked free, because Tuckers stirred up confusion about his identity.

Afterwards, the solicitor, dragging hard on his cigarette, muttered something about the burden of proof. He had got his client off, but he didn’t look proud of it.

Legal aid work looks soul-destroying: this programme certainly was. We met a professional thief called Alex who was furiously indignant to be charged with a crime that, for once, he hadn’t committed.

Accused of criminal damage, Alex’s self-righteous defence was clear-cut: ‘I am a thief, right, and if I’m going to do something, I’m going to do it for financial purposes.’

To hear Alex tell it, he was a modern-day Robin Hood who, under this unjust accusation, had become the British Nelson Mandela. The courts sent him on his way, presumably to burgle more businesses.

To the perma-tanned senior partner at Tuckers, Franklin Sinclair, revving into the court car-park in his open-top sports car, repeat clients were meat and drink.

Food for thought: We spend £2.4 billion annually on biscuits, Britain's Favourite Supermarket Foods presenter Cherry Healey informed us

Sinclair was full of praise for one regular, a fat scar-faced yob called Kyle who was constantly getting into fights.

‘He’s the perfect client,’ Sinclair insisted. ‘He takes our advice and he’s never any trouble.’

The courts disagreed after 23-year-old Kyle threatened a police officer with a knife. Kyle’s defence, that a friend had dropped the knife and Kyle had picked it up for safekeeping, perhaps wasn’t their most watertight. Kyle got four-and-a-half years.

If the statistics for repeat crime in Manchester were grim, the figures trotted out on Britain’s Favourite Supermarket Foods (BBC1) were wholly head-spinning. 

As a nation, we drink 60 billion cups of 
tea a year. That, presenter Cherry Healey informed us, was enough to 
fill the Albert Hall 150 times over.

Cherry looked humbled by this statistic. But images like this aren’t helpful, because they divert the mind from the facts and start us puzzling about irrelevant problems.

Such as, how would you empty the Albert Hall, once it was filled with tea? If you simply opened the doors and let it pour down the steps, the surrounding streets would be awash. The nearby Royal College of Art would be flooded. There’d be hell to pay.

Cherry was not deterred. The statistics cascaded on. We spend £2.4 billion annually on biscuits, we eat 11.5 billion sandwiches, every one of us gobbles 128 packets of crisps each year, and if you lined up all the soup tins produced by a single factory, they would stretch from Wigan to Chicago.

But how could you line up cans across the ocean, Cherry? They’d sink. Were you proposing some sort of platform linking the continents, like a transatlantic Millennium Bridge? Have you considered the practicalities?

Cherry is a distracting presenter generally. She has the brisk demeanour and exaggerated facial expressions of a primary school teacher. Frowning, gaping, goggling, blinking and gasping, she threw herself at the cereal aisles and the fruit-and-veg section.

Full marks for trying, at any rate. Which is much more  than you could ever say for Tuckers’ clients.
