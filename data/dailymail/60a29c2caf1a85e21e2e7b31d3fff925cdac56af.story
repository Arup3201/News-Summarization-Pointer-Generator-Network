Meeting Santa Claus is supposed to inspire a joyous time for festivities and present swapping with the family. But judging by the looks on these children's faces they're more likely to have a nightmare before Christmas. 

He's known as the kindly old man who always puts a smile on kids' faces whether they see him in the chimney, tucking into milk and biscuits, leaving presents under the tree or, as is more likely, down at the shopping mall.

But when the parents of these children took their little ones to meet Father Christmas they had the fright of their lives sitting on the knee of ghoulish, gloved and sinister-looking Santas.

A surge of photographs showing frightening Father Christmases throughout the years have emerged on social media.

The hilarious pictures have been posted online as parents around the country look for a Santa to take their children to in the run up to Christmas, showing how a wholesome, loveable character can easily look scary and disturb little children.

Many of the wailing youngsters were probably wishing Father Christmas really didn't exist, as the one they're sitting with looks better placed in a horror film than meeting and greeting kids at a shopping centre. 

Some are wearing strange masks while others have wild hair and beards which make them look like they have been pulled through a hedge backwards.

The stare or grimace on the faces of some of the St. Nicks are enough to send a shiver down the bravest of spines.

Many of the children sitting on their knees look worried, with some even bursting into tears and screaming for their parents.

Some of the photographs go as fat back as the early 1900s, proving that Santa has always been a tricky one to pull off.

They might make you think twice about taking your little ones down to the local grotto!
