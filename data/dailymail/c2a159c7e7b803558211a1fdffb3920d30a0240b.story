News-Gazette. 'Witnesses said he experienced a Mae West-type 
malfunction, where the stout line goes over ... the canopy, so instead 
of one lobe, you have two lobes. He deployed the reserve parachute and 
then became limp. No one saw him move any more.'

Members of the World War II Airborne Demonstration Team honor veterans by participating in jumps that are modeled after paratroopers during the war.

Yost was well known by locals as an adventurous man who regularly completed ultra-marathons, long-distance bike rides in the U.S. and Europe, and parachute jumps on both sides of the Atlantic.

He was also a sports car aficionado who enjoyed restoring the vehicles.

'He did stuff a lot of people don’t even try,' said Van Hartman, an occasional companion on long-distance runs.

Jed Bunyan, who is a co-owner in the Body N' Sole Sports store called him 'the greatest runner I've ever known.'

'He ran a 24-hour race and posted one of the fastest times in the 
world in those years,' he said.

He was also known to help promote the Hood to Coast 195-mile relay race in Oregon.

In February, he was the focus of a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal profiling the World War II Airborne Demonstration Team's jump school and it's training program, which is modeled after that of paratroopers.

He was a Vietnam War veteran who served in the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and had a lifelong interest in World War II history, regularly visiting memorial cemeteries and battlefields.

'When I get on Omaha Beach or in Sainte Mere Eglise, I get 
emotional,' Yost once told reporters. 'It’s hallowed 
ground.'

Hartman called Yost a 'gun-ho' enthusiast about everything.

'It’s sad,' he said. 'But he was still doing what he loved to do.'
