Cate Blanchett is hotly tipped to take home a Best Actress Oscar on Sunday night for her performance in Blue Jasmine, so looking red-carpet ready is top of her list of priorities this weekend.

FEMAIL caught up with the A-lister ahead of the event to find out how she's preparing for one of the biggest nights of her career.

While she may be one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood - she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and three Golden Globe Awards - Cate is modest and down to earth.

So how is she beautifying herself ahead of Sunday? 'Well, you have to be nominated before you start to think about that,' she says. 'It’s got to be spontaneous, it’s got to be how you feel on the day.'

The 44-year-old describes her signature look as 'minimal' and maintains that life is too 'interesting' to spend too much time in front of the mirror.

'I don’t have a
 lot of time and I have three sons so they have no tolerance at all for 
mummy spending five minutes in front of the mirror,' she says.

'I go for a pale 
lip, and a bit of mascara. I think if you’re going to wear a red lip you
 don’t want it wearing you so it’s about finding the right colour.

'I 
love a good frock so if I’m going out it comes from that and the make-up 
goes accordingly. You probably have to wear less and less as you get a 
bit older, because I feel more confident now in the quality of my skin 
then I did ten years ago.'

Speaking about her Oscar-nominated role as Jamine, she said: 'For Blue Jasmine I made a decision not to wear 
any make up in the last shot of the film as I felt like she had such a 
mask on - I thought it would be a good idea to leave her with nothing 
and become completely transparent.'

Cate reveals that priming her skin is essential and one of the best tips she's picked up from make-up artists.

'I used to just put foundation on but I think it’s about how you prime your skin. SK-II have this wonderful luminising product and I put that on before I go out.'

It's no surprise that Cate uses SK-II, she has been a loyal supporter of the brand for twelve years and has recently became its ambassador.

Speaking about her preoccupation with her skin and decision to join forces with the brand, she said: 'I was pregnant with our son Dashall who is about to turn 12 and it was the first time I noticed my age.

'I think I had taken the fact that my skin was quite resilient for granted, and then being pregnant I started getting melisma, my skin was different.

'In terms of my regime every morning it’s so simple I don’t even have to think about it. It’s literally the Essence, the Serum and then I would put the LXP moisturiser on every night.

'I put the Essence in a beautiful spray bottle so then even after I've had my makeup done I’ll nip to the bathroom and spray it on the top. You don’t go out feeling powdery or like you’ve caked makeup on.'

As well as keeping her beauty regime to a minimum, slender Cate hasn't been hitting the gym in preparation for her red carpet moment.

'I don’t really [work out]. I have three boys so they keep me active. We walk a lot and run around a kick the ball and things like that.

'In the morning I’ve been taking 
chlorophyll with my son, so that’s been fantastic. I also love 
grapefruit juice and I don’t eat a lot of red meat. Hot water and lemon 
as well,' she said.

To keep her blonde hair in check, Cate swears by Viviscal supplements and, rather curiously, cling film.

'I got introduced by a French hairdresser who said it was really good for your skin, your nails and your hair. I’ve been on it for five weeks so I won’t notice the difference yet. They say five months, it’s all about consistency.

'I use the Philip Kingsley range of shampoos and they’ve got a great elasticiser which is fantastic. I wrap my hair in cling film and put that on,' she explained.

While she is often touted as one of the most beautiful women in the world, Cate said there as 'so many' women she looks up to and cites her ultimate style icon as Iris Apfel.

'I remember the first time I saw Gong Li in Farewell my Concubine - she’s the most unbelievably luminous beauty. She’s an amazing amazing beauty. But also Liv Ullman is amazing. And also Judi Dench. So so beautiful,' she said.

It's safe to say that Cate is a modern icon who has embraced her pale skin, but she wasn't always so comfortable with it.

'In
 4th form at school my mother pulled me off the tin roof (I was trying 
to get a tan with baby oil) and she said this is not going to happen for
 you, come inside and put some sunscreen on.

'So I went the other way and went sort of goth.'

With a reported net worth of £27m, Hollywood's leading lady has experienced hotels, restaurants and holidays that the rest of us could only dream of but materialism isn't what makes her happy.

'I love the unexpected. You know standing on a cliff looking out on the horizon or when you’re in the country and the hills just roll and roll and roll.

'I remember years ago I was in Turkey and I climbed the highest mountain in Turkey at sunrise when I was 18 and you could just see the light beginning to come in. So yes, definitely views.

'I am happiest when I don’t know what’s coming next. '
