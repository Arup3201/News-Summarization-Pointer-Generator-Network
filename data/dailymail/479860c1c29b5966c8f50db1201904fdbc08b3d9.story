Charles Manson's fiancee has spoken out for the first time about her engagement to tell the world: 'I think he's the most handsome man in the world.'

Afton Elaine Burton, who goes by the mononym 'Star', tells Inside Edition on Monday that she still plans to marry the 80-year-old convicted murderer despite the fact that their marriage license expired earlier this month.

She insists Manson did not brutally murder Sharon Tate and six others and adds that she wants to 'take very good care of him'.

Her words come amid claims she tricked her murderous beau into an engagement so that she could put his corpse on display after his death.  

Vow: Afton Elaine Burton, 27, insists she will marry Charles Manson although their marriage license expired

Side-stepping the allegation, Burton reminds the interviewer that she moved to California nine years ago to care for Manson, who is not eligible for parole until 2027 - when he will be 92.

'Yes, I'm going to marry Charles Manson,' Burton declares.

Manson has been in prison in Corcoran, California, since 1969, when he was convicted of murdering Roman Polanski's wife, the actress Sharon Tate, and six others. 

He was aided by three women - his 'followers'. Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain encarcerated. A third, Susan Atkins, died of cancer in prison.

According to the New York Post, Burton tried to get the rights to Manson's remains without marrying him, but was turned down.

The paper claimed that she offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die.

The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him.

He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal. 

Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.'

'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.'

Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California.

The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired.

Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and they had their final shot two weeks ago before the license expired on February 5.

Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way.

Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.

Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married.

'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead.

She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him.

Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963.

He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.

Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027.

Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans, in the hope of sparking what he termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.
