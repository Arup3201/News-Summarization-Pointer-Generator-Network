Deborah Hargreaves, chair of High Pay Centre, said structures are still completely flawed

Bosses of the top 100 companies enjoyed just under £4.3million in pay and perks last year after an average pay rise of 10 per cent. 

A report shows how the leaders of FTSE 100 firms continued to enjoy salary hikes, while ordinary workers endure pay freezes or meagre increases.

Campaigners said last night that the figures were further evidence of ‘completely flawed’ pay structures that reward company bosses for ‘being in the right place at the right time’.

The average package handed to a chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm hit £4.25million in 2012, a rise of 10 per cent on the year. 

A rally in the stock market has led to huge windfalls for business leaders.

This has driven a 40 per cent increase in the value of long-term shares bonuses issued in previous years, according to analysis from shareholder group Manifest and consultancy MM&K. 

The bumper windfalls also mean that even companies which have tried to show more restraint, by reducing cash bonuses, have still paid their chief executives more than the previous year.

Deborah Hargreaves, chair of campaign group the High Pay Centre, said the fact business leaders’ overall pay packets had still increased showed ‘performance-related pay structures are completely flawed’.

‘They are too easy to reach, and reward business leaders for being in the right place at the right time rather than successful, sustainable management of their company,’ she said.

Calling for a ‘major overhaul of executive pay’, she added: ‘Executives have seen their rewards racing ahead of the rest of the workforce. Pay for everyone else has been frozen or failed to keep up with inflation. This leads to a great sense of injustice in the workplace.’

By contrast, households across the country have seen the spending power of their earnings eroded by inflation, which fell to 2.4 per cent in April. 

Angela Ahrendts was the highest paid boss last year, scooping £16.9million in pay and perks

The average worker received a pay rise of just 1 per cent, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest since its records began in 2001.

The average annual increase for the last decade was just 1.3 per cent. 

Angela Ahrendts, American chief executive of British fashion brand Burberry, was the highest paid boss last year, scooping £16.9million in pay and perks. 

While the top five highest paid bosses received around 18 per cent less in 2012 than the previous year, the remainder of the FTSE 100 bosses were handed an average 17 per cent increase in pay and perks. 

The Coalition’s plans to cut greed in the boardroom could see  shareholders given powers to block huge pay packages.
