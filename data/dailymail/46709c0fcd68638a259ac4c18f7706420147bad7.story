Alway was dismissed of more than a dozen other counts under a plea agreement.

Some of those counts were resisting an officer, possession of a controlled substance, and receiving stolen property.

The Desert Sun reports that Alway has been in custody since last year at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility on $150,000 bail.

The ANTM finalist was arrested on June 28 in 2013 for investigation of burglary, fraud, narcotics possession, committing a felony while on bail and other charges, the Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement at the time of the arrest.

Officers responding to a report of a suspicious woman walking around a neighborhood spotted a condominium with an open back door, police said.

Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said.

Authorities believed an armed man also was in the condo and the SWAT team was called in for the ensuing six-hour standoff.

When Alway appeared before a judge last year she shaved her head for her court appearance in Palm Springs where she was given a drug evaluation. 

Her sister told TMZ after the 2013 court appearance that her sister wanted to 'start over' and that's why she chose to shave her head.

Alway finished in the top three of Cycle 8 of 'Top Model,' which aired in 2007.
