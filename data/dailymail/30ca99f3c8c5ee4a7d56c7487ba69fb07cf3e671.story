A football referee who tried to commit suicide in his hotel room hours before a top-flight match owes his life to his three assistants, said the head of the German Football Association.

Babak Rafati, 41, tried to take his own life ahead of the Bundesliga game between Cologne and Mainz, which was called off 40 minutes before kick-off with fans already filling the Mungersdorfer Stadion.

Rafati, a former banker of Iranian descent, was today released from hospital and his father said he had apologised to the family.

'He said he loved me. He wanted to apologise. I am very happy that he is ok,' said Djalal Rafati.

Rafati was discovered in the bath of his Cologne hotel room two hours before kick off on Saturday.

He was found by his assistants - 
Holger Henschel, Frank Willenborg and Patrick Ittrich - who received no 
answer when they knocked on his door after he failed to show up for a 
meeting.  

Dr Theo Zwanziger, President of the German FA (DFB), described the pressure on referees as 'immense' and said that Rafati was only alive thanks top the actions of his colleagues.

'I have got to say that these three have saved his life,' he said.

'When they discovered him, they ensured that he could survive with quick emergency measures.

'They have explained everything to me and to the police. All I can say is compliments to them.

'They took immediate measures and kept their cool.

'It definitely took a lot to stabilise him and to contribute to him being able to remain alive.'

It took less than 15 minutes for 
Rafati's assistants to realise that something was amiss when the 
normally punctual referee failed to show up for a meeting in their 
hotel.

Attempts to call the Hanover-based 
official proved futile while the referee did not respond when they 
knocked on his hotel door either.

With the aid of a hotel worker, they 
gained access to Rafati's room, where they were confronted with a 
horrific discovery in the bath tub.

'They saved his life': Theo Zwanziger, president of the German football federation, paid tribute to Rafati's team of officials

'Naturally, all three of them are distraught,' added Dr Zwanziger.

'They were sat with him the night before and did not notice anything amiss.

'Only at 1.30pm when he did not appear, did they start to worry and they reacted quickly.

'It is certainly a burden for them 
when a close friend, with whom they have worked together for a long time
and officiated over important games, takes such a step.

More than 45,000 fans attended the funeral of Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, whose suicide stunned the world of football.

Enke was 32 when he stepped in front of a train near his Hanover home on November 10, 2009.

The highly-rated player had been suffering from depression for around six years but had not wanted the news to be public knowledge, his wife Theresa said after his death.

The player was afraid the couple's adopted eight-month-old daughter would be taken away from them if his illness was known.

In a country where football is so important, Enke's death prompted a debate about whether players receive sufficient psychological support, and struck a chord throughout the game.

'I think it still hasn't sunk in. I 
was pleased that they looked so composed, but I think that will change 
over the coming days.'

The three officials were provided with psychological care and Dr Zwanziger 
has promised that the German will 'provide them with all of the help 
that the DFB can offer' to come to terms with the experience.

But he expects them to be strong, given the nature of their job.

'You have got to be very tough to be able to cope with everything in this sport,' he said.

'Of course refereeing has become a very difficult job and there are a lot of demands placed on referees nowadays.

'It is not so easy to describe when 
you hear how people who play such an important role in top-level sport 
suddenly arrive in a situation where they feel there is no way out, 
which means they see no alternative in life.

'That is quite terrible.'

It is the second time in just over 
two years that German football has been rocked by suicide, following 
the death of the national team's goalkeeper Robert Enke on November 10, 
2009.

When the announcement was made at the
ground on Saturday that the game was to be called off there were boos 
from fans, but DFB official Dr Reinhard Rauball insists there was no 
other choice.

'I am deeply shocked and I believe that everybody connected with the Bundesliga feels the same way,' he said.

'Something like this has never happened before and it has deeply shocked people.

'If there was anything to be learned 
from the death of Robert Enke, then it was that football is not 
everything in life, as Theo Zwanziger said at the time.

'Calling off this game was the right decision, there is no doubt about that.'

Although Rafati was voted the worst 
referee three times in the last four years in a poll of Bundesliga 
players conducted by Kicker magazine, he nevertheless earned his place 
on the FIFA refereeing register in 2008.

And given the reaction of two Bundesliga coaches, he is a well-liked personality.

'It is shocking,' said Hanover coach Mirko Slomka.

'Babak Rafati is a good friend in our club and in our team so we are particularly interested in knowing how he is.'

Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath added: 
'Babak Rafati is one of the referees I like the most and I hope that we 
see him again soon in the Bundesliga.'

Rafati has been a referee since 1997 
and a Bundesliga referee for six years, with his first ever match having
also been between Cologne and Mainz. He has officiated 84 top-flight 
German league games.

He had been a FIFA referee since 2008, but was not nominated by the DFB to referee this year at international level.
