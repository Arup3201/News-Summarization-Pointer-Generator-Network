Three Scotland Yard officers jailed for dealing drugs could have their convictions overturned in a new undercover policing scandal, it was revealed today.

Derek Haslam, an officer who infiltrated South London's criminal underworld, is alleged to have befriended the corrupt detectives to pass back information to the Met before their 2000 trial.

The Court of Appeal in London heard yesterday that Mr Haslam was the Yard's 'spy in the defence camp' after he befriended Tom Kingston, Tom Reynolds and Terry O'Connell.

The trio were found guilty of a conspiracy to supply £7,500 of the drug speed in 2000 but their QC has said their convictions may be unlawful because the Met carried out a 'fundamental abuse of the process of the court'.

 DC Tom Reynolds, and Terry O'Connell (left to right) but they now want their 
convictions overturned

At the time
 of their convictions it was branded the biggest corruption scandal to 
hit the Metropolitan Police in 30 years but judges will now consider 
whether it was 'unsafe'.

Undercover cop: Derek Haslam, whose face has been covered for legal reasons, has called the allegations about him 'absolute garbage'

According
 to the Independent the court heard yesterday Haslam allegedly visited 
one of the suspects in a Sussex prison ahead of his trial and took 
defence material, before photocopying it and handing it to the Met.

Representing the convicted police officers - who were part of the 'Groovy Gang' drug dealing ring - Alun Jones QC said: 'We have material that raises reasonable grounds to believe that the Met
 police appointed a spy called Derek Haslam to 
befriend Mr Kingston when he was preparing his defence, in order to 
report back to police.

'There are grounds to believe that (anti-corruption command) used Mr Haslam as a spy in the defence camp to
 see privileged material, that would be a fundamental abuse of the 
process of the court.'

Mr Haslam, who says he fears for his life because he was unmasked as an undercover operative, told the Independent the claims were 'absolute garbage. Complete and utter twaddle.'

It came just months after it emerged a police spy passed on confidential details about the breakdown of Neville and Doreen Lawrence’s marriage to Scotland Yard bosses.

The undercover officer sent reports of how the couple ‘had, in reality, separated’ during the Macpherson inquiry into their son Stephen’s racist murder.

In one, he made it clear that the collapse of the couple’s marriage ‘is not public knowledge’. Details of the astonishing intrusion of privacy are contained in the Ellison review into the Stephen Lawrence case.

In the new case Mr Jones QC also questioned the evidence of Neil Putnam - a police officer turned  'supergrass' who made a series of claims linked to the Stephen Lawrence investigation and how an officer had links to the father of one of his killers.

His evidence was central to the convictions of the three men.

Intrusion: In March it emerged an undercover police officer passed 
on details about the breakdown of Doreen and Neville Lawrence's marriage
 to bosses at Scotland Yard

Evidence: The Crown says evidence from the Met used to convict the three me is 'safe'

The Met 'suppressed' some of Putnam's evidence from Sir William Macpherson's inquiry into the first botched investigation which means the Met the CPS no longer saw him as a 'witness of truth', Mr Jones said.

Crispin Aylett QC, for the Crown, said Putnam could still be trusted despite his dispute with Scotland Yard over the Lawrence case.

The judges have reserved their decision on the case until a later date.
