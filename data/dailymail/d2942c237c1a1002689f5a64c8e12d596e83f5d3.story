Too soon?

As outrage continues to build over the National Security Administration's controversial Prism program, in which the federal government collects the electronic communications (email, text messages, phone calls, etc.) of average citizens, the nation's highest intelligence official is yucking it up about what many consider to be an unconstitutional violation of the U.S. citizenry's right to privacy.  

Foot-in-mouth-prone Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke at a black-tie dinner honoring former CIA and National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden on Friday night and - just days after admitting that he'd provided false testimony to Congress in regards to the Prism program - started cracking jokes about reading people's emails.

Waka-waka! Director of National Intelligence James Clapper already is cracking jokes about the federal government's controversial Prism program

'Some of you expressed surprise that I showed up,' Clapper quipped, according to the blog Government Executive.  'So many e-mails to read!”

But Clapper's comedy show was just getting started - shortly after the line about reading people's emails, he tackled another controversial topic-du-jour.

Last week - much to the ire of the airlines, pilots unions and Congress - the Transportation Safety Administration removed pocket knives from its list of prohibited items. So, naturally, Clapper worked it into his routine. 

While greeting Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole, Clapper asked, 'John, can I borrow your pocket knife?'

Clapper's big mouth has landed him in hot water on several occasions over the course of his career.

In 2003, while attempting to explain the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Clapper, then the head of the Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, said the weapons were there, but they'd been shipped out of the country to places like Syria just prior to the American invasion - a conclusion his own agency said it 'could not provide further evidence to support.'

In 2010, while serving as under-secretary of defense for intelligence, Clapper let it slip to Diane Sawyer that he had no clue that 12 would-be terrorists had been arrested in England earlier that day, despite the news having been broadcast across international news outlets like CNN and the BBC.

In February, 2011, Clapper appeared before a House intelligence committee while serving in his current post as director of national intelligence. During the hearing, Clapper gave the Muslim Brotherhood - a violent, Islamic jihadist group - what pundits would later call a 'PR makeover.'

'The term "Muslim Brotherhood"…is an umbrella term for a variety of 
movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely 
secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a 
perversion of Islam…there is no overarching agenda, particularly in the
 pursuit of violence,' Clapper explained to the committee.

Is it something I said? Clapper's comments have landed him in hot water several times over the course of his career.

Those comments were later described by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton as 'perhaps the stupidest statement made by any administration in U.S. international history.'

In March 2011, as the U.S. was assisting rebels in their efforts to oust Libyan dictator Muammar Gadaffi, Clapper - as the Director of National Intelligence - told the Senate Committee on Armed Services that 'over the longer term, [Gadaffi] will prevail.'

Even the White House tried to distance itself from Clapper's comments, with then-National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon telling reporters Clapper's gaffe was nothing more than a 'static and one-dimensional assessment.'

During that same hearing, Clapper neglected to include Iran and North Korea on a list of nuclear powers that might pose a threat to the United States - the general consensus, of course, is that the U.S.' two biggest nuclear threats are those very countries.
