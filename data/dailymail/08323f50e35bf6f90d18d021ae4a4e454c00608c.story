Rob Elliott's misfortune meant a dream debut for Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick, who kept Chelsea at bay after coming on for the entire second half in the famous upset.

Toon's third-choice keeper admits he had no time to tense up after being told his services would be required with the score 0-0 against the Premier League leaders. 

And if he didn't feel like he belonged from the outset he certainly made his presence known with saves on Diego Costa and Filipe Luis in a nerve-wracking six minutes of injury time.

'I was a little bit nervous but it was slightly easier coming on at half-time because I didn't have time to think about it too much,' Alnwick told BT Sport after Newcastle's 2-1 win.

Elliott was finally getting a chance to prove himself in the absence of injured Tim Krul, who is out for at least a month, but he pulled up after taking a goal kick and didn't return after the break. 

Alnwick, 21, was put to work soon after his arrival punching away a Cesc Fabregas free-kick and was put under extreme pressure as Chelsea looked to exploit their strength in the box, especially when chasing the game with Didier Drogba and Diego Costa in tandem.  

'It was a great experience for me and I'm just happy to get the victory. Everyone backed me and showed me great support, the gaffer, the backroom staff, everyone,' said the relaxed debutant.

While making a number of good saves and showing confidence in his area, Alnwick was helpless as Drogba rose above his defenders to peg one back after Papiss Cisse scored a double. 

But it wasn't enough for Jose Mourinho's side and after some feverish closing moments Alan Pardew's men kept their heads with their young custodian at the heart of it all.

Jak is the brother of former Spurs keeper Ben Alnwick, now at Peterbrough, and has represented England at under-18 level. 

He joined Newcastle's academy squad from Sunderland in 2008 and Saturday's appearance was his first in a competitive match for the first team.
