Team news

Chelsea

Diego Costa is set to return to Chelsea's starting line-up, despite his hamstring travails, for the Premier League clash at home to Aston Villa.

Striker Costa, who has scored seven Premier League goals this season, was rested for the midweek Capital One Cup defeat of Bolton, in which Chelsea made nine changes from the side which began the draw at Manchester City.
