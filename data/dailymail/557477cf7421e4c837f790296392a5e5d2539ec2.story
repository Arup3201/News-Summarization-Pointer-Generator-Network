A man was seriously hurt when he jumped off a canal bridge for charity - but missed the water and hit a towpath.

Lewis Elliott, 25, was reportedly jumping of the 20ft bridge on the Leeds to Liverpool Canal to raise money for charity on Christmas Eve.

But as he climbed over the barrier, wearing just his underwear, he slipped - missing the water and hitting the towpath.

Police today said the man from Blackburn, Lancashire was drunk at the time.

Fall: Lewis Elliott, 25, fell from a bridge over the Leeds Liverpool Canal and landed on the towpath, pictured. Customers in a nearby pub were concerned for his safety and even offered him money not to jump

Customers in the nearby Canal Street pub, where Mr Elliott is said to be a regular, were reportedly concerned for his safety before the jump.

Some claim they offered to give him money not to climb over the edge.

Mr Elliott is said to be having treatment for head and chest injuries in the Royal Preston Hospital.

It is believed he was trying to raise money for a charity that has helped his sick son.

His uncle, Lee Tanner, said: 'He was walking into the middle to jump into the canal and he slipped.

'Lewis banged his head and knocked himself out. I just hope he gets better soon.'

Stephen Oliver, 51, was walking over the Kings Bridge Street bridge when he witnessed the incident.

He said: 'I saw this guy run up the small cobbled street from The Navigation pub and he only had boxer shorts and shoes on.

'He ran past me and grabbed the barrier and jumped over, but I think he might have caught his foot on the edge.

'Serious injuries': The man - who police say was 'drunk' at the time - was taken to Royal Preston Hospital with head and chest injuries after the incident on Christmas Eve

'I heard a thump and started panicking, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.I ran over and looked down and just saw him lying on his front with his head to the side.

'Then more people came from the pub and were standing with him and someone was calling 999.

'He was lying like that for about an hour and I stayed because I wanted to see if he was okay, until the air ambulance arrived.

'Even if he had landed in the water he could have seriously hurt himself or caught hypothermia.'

A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said there would be no further police involvement in the fall.

She said: 'According to the report we received, the man attempted to jump off the bridge and into the canal due to drunkenness, but missed the water.

'He was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital with serious head injuries and was said to be stable. There were no suspicious circumstances.'

A spokesman for the North West Air Ambulance said: 'We attended the incident after a report that a man had jumped from about 15ft. He was seriously injured and we flew him to Royal Preston Hospital.

'He was as stable as he could be under the circumstances.'
