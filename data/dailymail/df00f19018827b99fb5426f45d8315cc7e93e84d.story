Christmas shoppers travelling back from Europe after attending festive fairs or on a ‘booze cruise’ have been warned they could be targeted by illegal immigrants desperate to reach Britain.

Cars and other private vehicles could be increasingly hit by stowaways who have traditionally tried to enter Britain in lorries, said an executive at Eurotunnel.

John Keefe, Eurotunnel's public affairs director, told MPs he feared the immigration crisis at Calais would intensify as queues develop in France in the run-up to Christmas.

More than 2,500 immigrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, are massing around the port in the hope of sneaking aboard a ferry, train or lorry to reach the UK illegally.

The city’s mayor Natacha Bouchart has said illegal migrants are 'prepared to die' to cross the Channel, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado.

Mr Keefe told the House of Commons' home affairs select committee: ‘The crisis could potentially get even worse. As we approach winter, it could start to overlap on to the passenger market.’

He said that as the Christmas holiday season approached there would be longer queues of traffic as people waited to board the Channel Tunnel shuttle trains after shopping trips on the Continent.

Mr Keefe said: ‘The slower the flows of traffic through the border, the more opportunity there is for migrants to jump on to vehicles.’

His warning came after it was reported that a suspected illegal immigrant managed to smuggle himself behind the front seat of a woman's Fiat Panda to get into Britain.

In September, Sue Taber, 59, told how she arrived back on the Eurotunnel after a trip to Costa Blanca in Spain.

She said she believed the man got into her car unseen as she stopped to put her dogs through the pet reception facility in Calais, and remained hidden until she arrived home near Dover, Kent.

The man, who was aged in his late teens, was later detained by police and handed over to the Home Office.

The Road Haulage Association's international affairs head Peter Cullum and the UK Chamber of Shipping's head of taxation, ferry and cruise Tim Reardon also told MPs they regarded Calais as being in crisis due to the migrant problem.

Mr Cullum said the problem should have been sorted out years ago, while Mr Reardon said Calais was now regarded not as a port and a place to do business but as ‘a place where there is a problem with migrants’.

Mr Keefe said migrants were living in ‘appalling conditions’ in Calais, adding: "I have heard people say they are among the worst refugee camps in the world."
