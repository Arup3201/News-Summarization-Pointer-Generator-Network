A mother  has spoken of her shock at discovering she was pregnant only while in labor with her fourth child.

Mandie Smith, 33, from Culloden, West Virginia, says she woke at 2am on Thursday morning with what she described as 'significant pain'.

'I thought I was having some kind of other medical problem,' she told WSAZ.com.

Surprise: Mandie Smith, 33, from Culloden, West Virginia, had no idea she was pregnant when she went into labor with baby Harrison in the early hours of Thursday morning

In fact, Mrs Smith was nine months' pregnant and going into labor.

Despite her shock, little Harrison was safely delivered later that morning in hospital at 7.45am. 

Mrs Smith says she experienced no significant weight gain over the past nine months, and had been wearing all her normal clothes.

She added that while she does not have normal menstrual cycles, all three of her other pregnancies were detected early.

Friends of Mrs Smith and her family are equally stunned by news of the new arrival.

'Everybody has been like, "What?"' she said. 'We've been texting people showing the baby, and they were like, "I was with you yesterday, you didn't look pregnant." Nobody believes it. Everybody's in shock.'

Doctors say that though it seems crazy, Mrs Smith's experience is not as unique as one might think. 

'Pregnancy usually has signs that are loud and clear,' says West Virginia OB-GYN Dr Allan Chamberlain. 'But every year, more than 1,000 women in this country have babies before even knowing they were pregnant.'

Mrs Smith's husband, JR Smith, was away on business in Washington DC, but was able to watch the birth via Facetime. 

'I'm still kind of in shock,' he told WSAZ. 'It was just a split second and tears of joy.'

The couple, who already have three sons together, say their boys are thrilled to have a new baby brother. 

'They were over the moon,' Mrs Smith said.
