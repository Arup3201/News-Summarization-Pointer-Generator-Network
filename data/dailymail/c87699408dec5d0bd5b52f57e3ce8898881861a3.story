Ditch the eye mask, ear plugs and incense sticks - if you can’t get to sleep then what you really need is a vibrating bed.

And soon you could own one for just £1,000 ($1,660) with the launch of a smart bed created by an entrepreneurial British designer.

Joe Katan, 52, from North London, developed the Balluga bed which is made up of small air balls, covered by foam that adapt to suit any weight and size.

It has an inbuilt temperature control system, which can heat or cool varying parts of the bed and is perfect if sharing with a partner because it can control the temperature of each side separately.

The bed has a built-in vibrating mattress that can be connected to an entertainment system to provide an additional sensations - such as experiencing every bump while racing on a games console.

Katan has been working on the project for the past eight years, after having sleepless nights in his own bed.

‘I was fed up after buying a good quality, high end bed and finding it had lost firmness and was past its best after just a few years,’ he said.

‘I was having sleepless nights as it was so uncomfortable and I resented not being able to fix the problem.

‘After eight years of careful testing and design we have come up with a bed which is not only comfortable but fun and reliable as well.’

The bed also has safety features which include a built-in emergency smoke alarm and fire detectors.

‘A key factor of the Balluga Sleep System is that it is all controlled via an app so when you travel you are able to take your preferred settings to anywhere that has the Balluga system - in essence taking your bed everywhere you go,’ said Mr Katan.

The bed, which also includes features such as connecting to Wi-Fi, syncing to entertainment systems and projecting images onto the ceiling, will turn itself off when the occupant is asleep.

It comes with a 20-year guarantee due to be sold via luxury brand VeryFirstTo from November 2014.

‘We wanted to bed to be something everyone can enjoy and be accessible,’ said Mr Katan.

‘It could be useful for those being cared for at home, as temperature can be controlled and it would be more comforting than having a hospital bed in the home.’

The Balluga bed will be featured at the Gadget Show Live in Birmingham on 8 April as part of the British Inventors Stand.
