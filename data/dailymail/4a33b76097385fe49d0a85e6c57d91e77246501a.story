Former Islamic State fighters who deserted the terror group have leaked a set of chilling letters purportedly containing the handwritten orders and commands of senior commanders.

The notes contain orders for ISIS militants to carry out suicide bomb explosions, to besiege villages in Syria and Iraq and even to claim credit for last month's terror attacks in the French capital, Paris.

Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent, and are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters, whose job it is to pass on or act upon the information contained in the letters.

Brutal: This letter dated August 22 last year refers to the distribution of 'relief goods' - understood to be food and medical supplies. In it the commander of Raqqa province demands a militant named Abu Imad ensures the supplies are only given to the Mujahideen brothers [fighters], not the suffering local population

Claim: The letter on the right contains an order for a militant named Faruq al-Jazrawi to contact the ISIS media office in Deir ez-Zor immediately in order to take responsibility for Paris' Charlie Hebdo terror attack

Demonstration: Thousands of French citizens are seen taking part in a solidarity march through the streets of Paris after last month's terror attacks left 17 people dead. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the atrocities

The letters have not been independently verified and ISIS are yet to comment on them, but they were originally published on a Twitter account claiming to represent ISIS' Al Qaeda-affiliated enemy in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra - also known as the Al-Nusra Front.

Each of the handwritten notes was shared on the social media website with the hashtag #HackingTheSecretMessagesOfBaghdadiState and came with an explanation that they had originally been given to jihadis who had fled ISIS, according to Vocativ.

The men are now said to be fighting for Al-Nusra in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor - an ISIS stronghold - and are determined to expose the inner workings of the barbaric terror group which has seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in its campaign of rape and massacre.

One letter purportedly sent from ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa on January 13 contained an order for a militant named Faruq al-Jazrawi to contact the ISIS media office in Deir ez-Zor immediately in order to claim responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris six days earlier.

Another letter sent on May 13 last year contains a sickening order for a fighter named Abu Ahmad al-Tunisi to organise a suicide bomb attack on the 'disbelievers of Shejil' - a village near Deir ez-Zor. The note insists 'one of the brothers from the [Arab] peninsula' carry out the atrocity.

Militants: Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp, indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS' network of messengers and fighters

Another letter purportedly sent by the Islamic State on August 22 last year refers to the distribution of 'relief goods' - understood to be food and medical supplies.

In it the commander of Raqqa province demands a militant named Abu Imad ensures the supplies are only given to the Mujahideen brothers [fighters], not the suffering local population.

Each of the letters is signed with a blue stamp, which appears to indicate authenticity and the province from which it was sent. The vast majority of the leaked letters were sent between commanders in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor provinces.

Deir ez-Zor is also where the branch of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front terror group - who say they came in to possession of the letters when local ISIS fighters defected - claim to be based.

The letters are among the first indications of how the terrorist organisation operates. The brief, handwritten instructions recall the so-called 'pizzini' Sicilian Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano used to communicate with the rank and file while on the run from the authorities in the 1990s.

The emergence of the letters comes amid reports that ISIS' leadership  has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi  (pictured)

Dead: Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left), a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army turned ISIS commander, Abu Musa al-Alwani (right), has also been killed

 The jihadi who murdered two civilians in Denmark swore allegiance to Islamic State just nine minutes before his first attack.

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein declared his devotion to the terror group on his Facebook page and then gunned down a film director at a free speech debate in Copenhagen.

 

The 22-year-old fanatic later killed a volunteer security guard at a synagogue before police shot him dead.

Last night it emerged that Danish intelligence service PET was warned that El-Hussein had become radicalised while in prison.

A senior member of his former gang, called the Brothas, said El-Hussein had been released two weeks ago.

Abo Saddam added: 'When he went inside he was a member of our gang. He lived his life with us. We would drive around, smoke hashish together, fight rival gangs. This is the Omar that I knew.

'But when he came out he changed. He stopped keeping in touch with the Brothas. 

The emergence of the letters comes amid reports that the Islamic State's leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, have killed more than 6,000 fighters since September, including more than half the militants serving on ISIS' ruling council.

Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq.

His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders.

This because his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists is becoming increasingly small the longer the airstrikes continue targeting the terror group.

Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes.

The likelihood, however, is that Baghdadi has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months.

Other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq that remain under ISIS' control.

This forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead, or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if ISIS' rivals on the ground.
