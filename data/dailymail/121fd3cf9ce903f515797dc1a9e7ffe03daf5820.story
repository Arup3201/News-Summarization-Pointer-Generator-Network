Sinclair won the best groundsman trophy and was presented the accolade by the club's legendary former manager.

At the IOG Industry Awards 2014, United beat finalists Burnley to win the IOG Campey/Imants Professional Football Grounds Team of the Year.

Sinclair and Co take care of the Old Trafford turf and that at the club's Carrington training HQ, as well as two other training grounds they tend to on behalf of United's  academy sides.

Sinclair told United's official website in June, 2013: 'It's the most vital tool to the team. If the pitch isn't right then the repercussions can be great. The players want a lush, wet, fast-moving surface so they can perform to the highest level.

'It means coming in at a weekend when United are not at home and cutting the grass or checking there are no diseases, because it's nature. You have to live it, no doubt about it.

'It's the most famous stadium in the world and I've seen some really significant moments. Some of the goals that have been scored on this pitch in the last ten years are incredible.'
