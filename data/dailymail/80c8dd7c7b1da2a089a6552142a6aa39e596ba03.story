Petrol prices are predicted to soar by up to 10p a litre if a huge British oil refinery closes after its petrochemical division was put into liquidation.

Production at the refinery in Grangemouth in central Scotland has been suspended for over a week because of a strike threat by militant trade union Unite.

In a dramatic move today, owner Ineos closed the petrochemical side of the plant – with the loss of 800 jobs – threatening the refinery’s future and a further 570 jobs.

Desperate: Staff stage a protest at Grangemouth in a last ditch attempt to save the refinery

'Sad day': Workers walk through the Grangemouth oil refinery in Falkirk, Scotland, following a meeting where owners Ineos have decided to shut down the petrochemical side of the complex

Ian Fyfe, Ineos human resources director, admitted: ‘The petrochemicals plant going into liquidation cannot be good news for the refinery.’

The strike threat at the refinery was scrapped but Ineos kept the plant closed, insisting that workers accept a three-year pay freeze, cuts to overtime pay and an end to their gold-plated final salary pension scheme.

It is understood the refinery could close permanently as early as December, after a 45-day consultation period for staff to accept new contracts.

The Swiss-based firm – run by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – is insisting workers also accept a no-strike deal. Unite has said workers will agree to this but Ineos claims there are too many strings attached to their offer.

Grangemouth supplies 13 per cent of the fuel used by the whole of Britain and 85 per cent of fuel in Scotland, where it is the sole refinery.

If it closed, an AA spokesman said: ‘It could add between 8p and 10p on to a litre of petrol.’ The average price of a litre of petrol is currently £1.32. The number of refineries in Britain has fallen to seven from 22 in 1973.

BP was yesterday holding crisis talks about a potential closure because the huge Forties pipeline – which carries oil from more than 50 North Sea fields – is powered by steam from the Grangemouth site.

Dispute: Some 800 people will be out of work

Decision: The owners of the plant, Ineos, said the site is being shut down because it is losing £10m a month

The industrial dispute at the refinery began when employee Stephen Deans was suspected of conducting Labour Party business on company time.

Mr Deans, who has worked for the company for 24 years, is chairman of the Labour Party in nearby Falkirk and is a shop steward with Unite.

He was suspended and the union balloted for a walkout.

He was reinstated and Unite withdrew the strike threat, but Ineos had already decided to suspend production at the plant.

Leaving: Owners of the plant say it is losing £10million a month. Ineos said it would reopen the site if the union agreed not to strike

Upset: Calum Maclean, Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman, said 'we have tried our hardest to convince employees of the need for change'

Mr Maclean said: 'The workers were offered sizeable pay cuts as well as a substantial reduction in pension and holiday allowance, but employees refused to give into the demands'

Last night, Energy Minister Ed Davey insisted that he would ‘not leave any stone unturned to try to get to a resolution in this matter’. Michael Moore, who lost his job as Scottish secretary in the recent

Cabinet reshuffle, said closure would be an ‘act of industrial vandalism’.

Ineos said it had ‘no option’ but to close the petrochemical division because it was losing £50million a year. Last night, Unite launched an 11th-hour attempt to save the petrochemical plant.

However, Calum MacLean, chairman of Grangemouth Petrochemicals, said: ‘I was given a very clear message by the shareholders that this was a final decision. I will take back any proposals the union give us and give them to Jim Ratcliffe.’
