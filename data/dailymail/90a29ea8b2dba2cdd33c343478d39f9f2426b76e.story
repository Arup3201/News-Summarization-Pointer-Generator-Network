Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer  given an estimated $50million from his father's estate - plus $6million his brother and sister missed out on

Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer is in line for $6million more than either of his siblings after the details of his father's will were revealed.

Real estate tycoon Bernard Spitzer, who owned a string of luxury apartments around Central Park, died at the age of 90 earlier this month after a long battle with Parkinsons.

He left 10 per cent of his $500million fortune to each of his three children including son Daniel, 57, a neurosurgeon, and daughter Emily, 60, a lawyer.

Eliot, 55, was also handed 10 per cent of the fortune, but was left an additional $6million to be paid after his mother Anne passes away.

The remaining $250million was donated to the Bernard and A​​nne Spitzer Charitable trust, the New York Daily News reports. 

Eliot and Anne have also been handed control of the family business, Spitzer Enterprises, which Eliot had been running on behalf of his father. 

In his will, Bernard Spitzer wrote: 'I am mindful and take pride in the accomplishments of my children and the fact that they are established in life, in largest measure through their own talents and efforts, but as well, if in smaller measure, through the contributions of their mother and mine during our lifetime.

'It is for these reasons, and not through any lack of love for them, that I have left a substantial portion of my estate to the Bernard and A​​nne Spitzer Charitable trust.'

But despite Mr Spitzer's assertions, this is not the first time that Eliot has benefited from his father's business empire. 

Spitzer senior lent his son $4.3million in 1994 in his failed bid to become Attorney General of New York, a post he later won in 1998.

Eliot also stayed rent-free in one of his father's apartments, and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year managing his father's investments, according to Bloomberg.

According to Mr Spitzer's will, all debts owed to him by his children have been written off. 

While the reasons for Bernard Spitzer's decision were not made clear, the money will come in useful for Eliot as he is facing a $7.6million divorce settlement after splitting from wife Silda (left) in April

Eliot, whose own wealth is estimated to be around $46million, made a brief foray into the world of politics, becoming Democratic governor of New York late in 2006.

However he was forced to quit in disgrace just 14 months later after he was revealed to be infamous Client No.9 of the Emperors Club VIP call-girl ring.

While his wife, Silda, stood by him through that scandal, their 26-year marriage was ended after he was snapped going into the apartment of his publicist and girlfriend Lis Smith.

Silda and Eliot announced their split on Christmas eve 2013 after pictures of him sneaking around were printed in local papers, and  terms  in April - leaving Eliot with a $7.6million bill.

As part of the 'post-nuptial' Silda will receive a new car 'no more than every five years', a housekeeper and accountant, unspecified 'entertainment and activities expenses', a $100,000-per-year charity donation and a part-time assistant.

Eliot (pictured with Bernard in 2009) has benefited from his father's estate before. In 1994, Eliot was loaned $4.3million to help finance a failed bid to become New York Attorney General

Bernard Spitzer was the son of Austrian Jewish immigrants and grew up in Manhattan before building a property empire including luxury apartments around Central Park (pictured, the Spitzer home on 5th Avenue)

Spitzer senior was born in 1924 in New York as the son of Austrian Jewish immigrants and grew up on Manhattan’s impoverished Lower East Side.

He earned a degree in engineering, which he later admitted he found 'deadly dull', before serving as a Navy intelligence officer during the Second World War.

After the war finished he went into real estate,  helping create buildings such as The Crown at 730 Fifth Avenue and The Corinthian at 330 E. 38th Street.

Through his charitable trust he helped to found the Museum of Jewish Heritage, and gave $15 million to New York’s American Museum of Natural History for the Hall of Human Origins.
