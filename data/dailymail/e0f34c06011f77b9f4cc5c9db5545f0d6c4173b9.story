One of the biggest global pornography websites has exposed Australians' explicit online habits and stood them up against the world's other big porn consumers.

Pornhub's 2014 year in review revealed that Australia was the eighth biggest porn viewer in the world and ranked seventh in the world for page views per capita, with the average Aussie clicking on the website 96 times.

The top gong went to the United States in both categories, however Australians can let out a sigh of relief as New Zealand ranked one spot higher in views per person.

'Lesbian' topped the list of popular search terms followed closely by 'teen', 'milf', 'massage' and then 'squirt', all of which also fell into the global top seven favourites.

Moving away from mainstream adult industry personalities, Aussies clearly prefer their reality television celebrities with Kim Kardashian dubbed the country's 'top porn star'.

Interestingly, she was also revealed to be the favourite amongst women worldwide.

Apparently Aussies also love to watch their porn on the go with 50 per cent of the country's explicit material being watched on mobile phones.

The website also showed that Australia was the eighth biggest porn viewer in the world

Only 34 per cent of porn was viewed on a desktop computer while 16 per cent was seen on a tablet device.

Efficiency was not one of the country's high points however, with the average viewer's visit duration lasting 17 seconds higher than the average visit at 9 minutes and 33 seconds. 

Nepalese viewers were revealed to have the longest visit duration in the world, taking their time at 13 minutes and 39 seconds, while Azerbaijan proved the quickest with an average of six and a half minutes.

Pornhub even revealed the friskiest day of the week according to Australians whose viewing habits peek on a Friday and drops to their lowest on Saturday.

The month of November had the highest number of views while February ranked the lowest and Australians' viewings were also recorded as being significantly interrupted by public holidays.

New Year's Eve saw the biggest drop at -52 per cent, followed by Christmas Day at -28 per cent and Easter Sunday with -19 per cent.
