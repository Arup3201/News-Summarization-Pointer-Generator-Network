From formal state dinners to a visit to the royal stables, the Queen has clearly enjoyed entertaining President Michael D. Higgins of Ireland and his wife Sabina.

But while the convivial state visit might over, the beaming monarch had a consolation prize to look forward to - a runner at Newbury this afternoon.

After bidding the Irish president goodbye, the Queen travelled to the Newbury racecourse in Berkshire, to see her horse Enliven, a bay filly, ran in the Coln Valley Stud Bridget Maiden Fillies Stakes.

Not amused: The Queen looked less than impressed after Enliven failed to come up with the goods at Newbury

Cross: Enliven's less than stellar seventh place performance failed to meet with royal approval

Unfortunately for the Queen, the filly didn't quite live up to her regal owner, managing a less-than-impressive seventh place finish - well behind the eventual winner, Evita Peron.

Perhaps the filly was exhausted after the excitement of getting a pat from President Higgins during his visit to the Kingsclere Park House Stables in Berkshire yesterday.

After meeting Enliven and her stablemate Micras, President Higgins was shown the stable's facilities and met animals belonging to other notable owners - including former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

The Queen's glum countenance following Enliven's poor finish was in stark contrast to the smiles of this morning as she said a warm goodbye to the Irish president ahead of his flight back to Dublin.

Deep in conversation: The Queen chats with trainer Andrew Balding, brother of Clare, before the race

Meet and greet: Enliven (right) was among the horses to be introduced to racing fan President Higgins

Warm: The Queen clearly enjoyed the visit from the racing mad Irish President Michael D. Higgins

Pleased: The Queen bid the Irish President a fond farewell following a hugely successful state visit

Resplendent in an elegant oxblood coat, which she also wore for her trip to the races, the monarch was on top form as she and the Duke of Edinburgh gave the presidential couple a suitably regal send off.

Looking equally lovely was Ireland's First Lady Sabina Higgins, who was elegant in a soft oatmeal wool coat and a delicate pale pink fascinator.

President Higgins also seemed to have enjoyed the trip, beaming broadly as he shook hands with the monarch before being whisked off to the airport.

The Queen's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father George VI.

Elegant: The Queen appeared equally enamoured of Sabina Higgins, the chic Irish First Lady

All smiles: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh chuckle at a quip made by Ireland's President Higgins

Shared interests: The Queen and President Higgins share a love of horse racing

Like her father and grandfather before her, the Queen's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding.

During her long association with racing, the Queen has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby.

Last year, Estimate, a filly owned by the Queen, romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the delight of the monarch.

Despite her love of racing, the Queen no longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself, instead pottering around the Windsor Great Park on the back of her faithful Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma.

On their way: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh and the Irish presidential couple exchange farewells

Ready to go: The Queen lent President Higgins her Rolls Royce for the journey to the airport

Gentle: The Queen prefers to ride stolid Fell ponies, among them her favourite mount, Carltonlima Emma
