An Old Etonian who was viciously lampooned as 'Mr Toad' by locals on Facebook after taking over a much-loved Cotswold pub, has won a £9,000 libel damages payout.

Christopher Horne, 68, was hit with a torrent of 'offensive and salacious' abuse on a Facebook page set up by Alistair Dempster - who had previously worked at The Bell, in Moreton-in-Marsh, Judge David Mackie told London's High Court.

The two men 'fell out very substantially' over the running of the 18th Century coaching inn, the court heard, and the page became a platform for Mr Dempster and others to vent their spurious allegations.

It was originally intended to advertise the pub, but Mr Dempster, 49, re-branded the page, 'Toad of Bellenders - how not to run a Cotswold pub'.

The page had over 100 members, many of whom - along with Mr Dempster - posted a string of venomous comments about Mr Horne and his management of the popular hostelry.

Judge Mackie said Mr Dempster, now a barman at 'The Gate Hangs High' pub, in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, who was battling with Mr Horne for control of the page, constantly referred to him as 'toad of toad hall'.

Comments posted made 'serious allegations about his competence and sobriety' and of 'sexual impropriety during a cricket tour of Spain'.

All those accusations were groundless, the judge told the court.

Although Mr Dempster had now issued a full apology, at one point he had refused to back down from his comments, telling Mr Horne in a letter, 'I continue to regard you as flatulent, foul and distasteful, but ultimately as hot air'.

Mr Dempster's campaign lasted from May to November 2012, when Mr Horne secured a court order closing down the page.

Although he was not the only one to post comments, the judge ruled Mr Dempster 'responsible' for the web page and held that the campaign of abuse was 'motivated by malice'.

Mr Horne, who once stood as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate, said of the most offensive slurs: 'I could hardly go anywhere in Moreton without some of these matters being referred to.'

He was 'born and bred' in the Gloucestershire town, he said outside court, and had played for the local cricket team for over 50 years. His family has lived in the area for nearly 300 years.

In a series of postings, Mr Horne was unjustly branded an 'inveterate liar', also facing claims of poor 'management skills', mistreatment of staff and of shutting the pub for several hours 'because he can't seem to pull a pint by himself', said Judge Mackie.

One incendiary comment in July 2012 read: 'It p****s me off that people like this can get pubs and keep hold of them 'cos they have money', the court heard.

Another suggested that, while on a cricket tour, Mr Horne had been 'chased around a hotel in Spain' by a 'local pimp chasing payment for the whores Toad had failed to pay'.

Judge Mackie said that accusation was groundless and based entirely on gossip. Mr Horne said the 'fabrication' was 'designed to do him damage' and had been acutely embarrassing for him.

'There were allegations, by implication, of sexual harassment,' said Judge Mackie, who added: 'There were also allegations of consorting with pimps and prostitutes, and so on.'

Given the damage to Mr Horne's reputation, and the 'serious libels' involved, £9,000 compensation was appropriate, the judge ruled.

That amount would have been doubled but for the apology proffered by Mr Dempster, said the judge, who added: 'This was a campaign which continued for some months and must have been motivated by malice.'

Mr Horne told the judge he had had no choice but to come to court to vindicate his good name.

A spokesman for The Bell Inn said outside court: 'Obviously, it is a source of some gratitude that the judge has accepted that the conduct of Alistair Dempster was unacceptable and caused damage to The Bell.

'It is a great shame that one of the several offers to settle without the need for this quite awful lengthy legal action was not accepted.'

It is understood that no further action will be taken against anyone else who posted libelous statements on the Facebook page, unless they are repeated.
