An artist has turned the fantasy worlds he dreams about while sleeping into a series of haunting and magical images.

Until now, the 'parallel universes' seen by Polish artist Michal Karcz existed only in his mind, until he decided to turn his dreams into reality using computer technology.

The 35-year-old's vivid imagination has seen him produce eerie landscapes and chilling scenes from mysterious and beautiful imagined worlds.

Out of this world! An artist who dreams about fantasy landscapes in his sleep has managed to recall the other-worldly images and turn them into real-life works of art

Digital artist Michal Karcz collects pictures with his digital camera that he thinks will suit a composition he has in mind

He then sets about creating the 'Parallel World', which can take months to finish, by hand-stitching the images together like a collage on a powerful graphics computer

He then goes on to use bespoke, tailor-made lighting effects to make his dream become a reality

The artist, from Warsaw, Poland, said: 'I always wanted to create pictures which I had in mind or dreamed about'

Each image starts as a photo snapped in real life - and then Mr Karcz lets his imagination run wild.

When he has gathered enough images the artist uploads them to his computer and begins layering and blending them on photo editing software.

He then adds light effects and colours and manipulates the pictures until they look exactly as he imagined them while he was asleep or daydreaming.

Prints of the Parallel Worlds images cost from £80 to £280.

He said when he has a clear image in his mind he starts searching for appropriate locations or photos in his huge library, or he shoots some new photographs

Some of the images are so realistic and familiar they look as if they could be single photographs

He achieves the dream like images by taking an initial picture, then adding light effects, colours, curves, photomanipulation, and collages, and after mixing they are complete

He said: 'All of the pictures are in my head and they are my parallel worlds - I feel that I visit them each time I listen to music, close my eyes or sleep'

Mr Karcz, from Warsaw, Poland, said: 'I always wanted to create pictures which I had in mind or dreamed about.

'All of the pictures are in my head and they are my parallel worlds - I feel that I visit them each time I listen to music, close my eyes or sleep.

'When I have a clear idea in my mind I start searching for appropriate locations or photos in my huge library, or I shoot some new photographs.

'Everywhere I go I take my camera with me. I always see frames, possible pictures, scenes, and compositions.

The artist says he takes his camera with him 'everywhere he goes', in order to make sure he has all the possible elements of his dream like compositions

The digital artist said he always tries to make the images exactly as he has seen in his imagination, and the work can be painstaking

The former painter said that digital photography and software has given him the opportunity to generate unique realities that are impossible to create with ordinary dark room technique

The haunting images often feature large or abandoned structures jutting out of desert like landscapes, with a small solitary figure making their way across scene

'First of all I take an initial picture, after this I add light effects, colours, curves, photo-manipulation, and collages, and after mixing they are complete.

'I always try to make it as I saw it in my imagination, and a lot of the time it can take a while because the weather and lighting are very important.

'I create my artworks in postproduction. It could be one photo altered to cover my vision or manipulated, photomontage from few or many photos.'

Some of the most creative minds in history have had their best ideas or found inspiration in sleep - including surrealist Salvador Dali

He said: 'I always try to make an extraordinary picture and my goal is to make a viewer stop for a minute, to influence on emotions and take away from reality'

Some of the most creative minds in history have had their best ideas or found inspiration in sleep, including surrealist artist Salvador Dali.

Brian Wilson, the creative genius behind the Beach Boys stayed in bed for two years at the height of his band's fame.

And the Beatles' Paul McCartney claims that the tune for the band's  hit song Yesterday came to him in a dream

Artist Tracey Emin created the 1999 Turner Prize nominated My Bed, after a week spent in her bed following a painful break-up.
