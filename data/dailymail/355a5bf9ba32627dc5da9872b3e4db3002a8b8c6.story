Turmoil in the Tory party seemed liked a million miles away as Nadine Dorries turned her attention to her tan in I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

Nadine Dorries has tried to defend her appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! by comparing her jaunt to the time ministers spend abroad on official visits.

The MP was suspended by the Tory Party for failing to tell the Chief Whip she was jetting off to Australia to appear on the reality TV show. And it was confirmed yesterday that she is being investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Officer over claims she may have breached the MPs’ Code of Conduct.

Mrs Dorries, 55, could be away from the House of Commons for up to a month but is still drawing her £65,738 MP’s salary, while being paid up to £40,000 by ITV.

Astonishingly, the Mid-Bedfordshire MP justified her appearance on the show by saying she ‘mostly works seven days a week’ and ministers are often out of the country.

In an interview given before she left Britain, she claimed neighbouring MP Alistair Burt frequently travelled abroad without criticism in his role as a foreign minister.

Mrs Dorries – who has been pictured sunbathing topless during a pre-show stay at a luxury hotel – said: ‘In his ministerial role he has had 20 weeks abroad this year.

But do they say when he is in Qatar for weeks that he is neglecting his constituency?’

She claimed her constituents would understand why she has gone on the show.

Last night in Brussels, Mr Burt, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, said: ‘I am surprised Nadine believes there is some similarity between me being abroad on behalf of the British people, including my constituents, and her taking part in a TV show in the jungle.’

One of Ms Dorries' daughters revealed last night she has taken over her Twitter account, posting updates to her 12,000 followers

The show’s producers are understood 
to have told Mrs Dorries that she has been suspended by her party but 
sources in Australia say she has apparently decided to press ahead with 
her appearance on the show.

An update to her 12,000 followers on twitter read: 'Hello! I can confirm Nadine Dorries MP is in the jungle! I (her daughter) will be covering her Twitter in the meantime!'

It is thought the tweets are being posted by Ms Dorries daughter Cassie.

It also emerged today that Ms Dorries could be investigated over the revelations she kept another daughter, Philippa, on the public payroll as a parliamentary aide even after she had joined a major law firm as a full-time trainee.

Philippa is listed on the register of MPs' interests as an 'Office Manager/Executive Secretary' in her mother's office, despite joining Mischon De Reya in August. Ms Dorries agent insisted Philippa stopped working for her mum in August and the record had not been updated.

Earlier this year Philippa was revealed to be dating Tory MP Chris Kelly.

Speculation has grown that Mrs Dorries could defect to UKIP after she emerges from the jungle.

Bookies Ladbrokes slashed the odds that she would jump ship, making it just 2/1 that Mrs Dorries would join UKIP before the next election and 5/1 that she would leave she leaves politics for good.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage tried the play down an imminent defection, saying: ‘I haven’t had an application, she is in the jungle for a month.’ 

He added: ‘I wish her well with the creepy crawlies in the jungle as opposed to the creepy crawlies in Westminster.’

Mr
Farage said the Conservative party had gone too far in suspending Mrs 
Dorries: ‘If one of my MEPs who was not a frontbench spokesman decided 
to go into the jungle, I would see it as an opportunity to reach an 
audience of 16 million.’

UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said he would delighted if Mrs Dorries eventually joined UKIP. ‘We like her, she is feisty and has balls.’ He added: ‘I’m not sure this jungle thing is a good idea, I’d rather she came straight to us.

'But reality TV did not seem to harm George Galloway when he won Bradford. It doesn’t seem to matter what one does these days, it makes you wonder what you have to do to not get elected.’

Ms Dorries was suspended by
the Tory party after jetting out to Australia without telling the Prime
Minister what she was up to. Breaking her silence since arriving in 
Australia, the 55-year-old revealed her fears about missing her 
daughters, not being able to drink coffee and not knowing who won the US
election.

But she could 
not resist one last swipe at the Eton-educated PM, declaring: ‘I do not 
like arrogant people who think they are born to rule.’

She said: 'I am the first politician to go on I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!

'A
lot of people don’t vote and if they can see I am a normal mother who 
comes from a poor background and who didn’t go to a posh school, they 
may think they can be a politician too. Maybe they will trust us more.

'I
know there will be a backlash that I am going on this show, but I would
like to point out that I have never before taken a week away in 
Parliamentary time whereas a lot of other MPs have.'

The
55-year-old triggered a political storm when she jetted off to 
Australia without telling Mr Cameron, party whips or even her local 
activists.

But she said she thought the PM would be pleased to have her out of the way: 'I am a thorn in his side. He will be relieved.'

Mr Cameron has distanced 
himself from the suspension of errant MP Nadine Dorries from the 
Conservative Party over her appearance in the Australian jungle.

The Prime Minister made clear the 
decision to suspend the Mid-Bedforshire MP over her unsanctioned 
appearance in I’m A Celebrity was made by the
chief whip, Sir George Young.

When
news broke of her decision to sign up for the show and its famous 
‘bushtucker trials’, Mr Cameron’s aides had suggested that if she wanted
to make a fool of herself on national television, it was up to her.

But
as fellow MPs reacted with fury to Ms Dorries, they were quickly 
briefing that Mr Cameron had decided she should be reprimanded.

In another change of tone, Mr Cameron did nothing to claim the credit yesterday.

In
his first comments on the affair, he said at the close of his visit to 
the Middle East: ‘I think the Chief Whip has made the right decision, 
he’s responsible for these things. I think it was well made, well 
explained and he’s done the right thing.’

The
change of heart suggests the premier does not want to be seen to have 
over-reacted to a woman who once described Mr Cameron and the Chancellor
as ‘two arrogant posh boys’.

But a poll of 5,500 people for AOL.com 
showed the public was overwhelmingly behind the decision to suspend Mrs 
Dorries. Some 86 per cent backed the action, while just ten per cent 
thought the Tory party was wrong to suspend her.

Louise Mensch - the outgoing Tory MP 
for Corby who stood down last month to spend more time with her rock 
band manager husband in America - accused Mrs Dorries of ‘demeaning’ 
parliament.

Mrs
Mensch added: ‘Celebrity is fleeting; laws actually matter. I envy and 
honour my former colleagues, on all sides, who are still making them.’

Other senior politicians also poked fun at Mrs Dorries during Prime Minister’s Questions.

Nick
Clegg, standing in for Mr Cameron, said: ‘When I heard she had been 
sent to the jungle to eat insects, I thought that despite the appearance
of civility from our new chief whip, this indicated a new 
disciplinarian approach in our whips’ office,’ he said.

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman added: 'I am beginning to have quite a lot of sympathy with (Ms Dorries). All those rats and snakes... and that’s before she went to the jungle.’

But former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who has also been on the show, tweeted: ‘Pls back Nadine Dorries - victim of witch hunt by her party, and ‘on trial’ with no opportunity to even know she’s been suspended.’
