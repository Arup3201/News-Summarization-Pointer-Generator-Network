Skiers and snowboarders were up early this morning making the most of the snowfall - but they weren't in the French Alps, they were in Cumbria.

Adventurers were seen enjoying the snowy conditions at the Yad Moss Ski slopes near Garrigill, weaving down the slopes, before battling their way back up again.

Others were spotted attempting the odd trick as they snowploughed their way down the rolling English hills.

Visitors to the slope were enjoying a teeth-chattering 3C today.

The slope is run by volunteers and has been open for close to 40 years. According to the slope's website, the area is unsuitable for inexperienced skiers and snowboarders. It is 600m, long with a vertical rise of 120m. The facility's top station is at 725m.

According to the Met Office, two to four days of snow can typically be expected in Cumbria during November.

In December, this often increases to between six and ten days.

Elsewhere, Britons wrapped up warm to enjoy the winter sunshine - with many some heading to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden where the trees are starting to lose their leaves.

Cold but fine conditions are expected to continue throughout this weekend, with temperatures predicted to average at around 5 or 6C.

A Met Office spokesman said conditions today would be mostly dry with clear spells, but many could expect frost, with some experiencing some freezing fog patches. 

They added it would be cloudier across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with patchy light rain or showers in places.

On Saturday, dry conditions with sunshine can be expected with some foggy patches. The north of the UK  
will see some isolated showers.

'We are looking at a few days of settled weather with cold, dry days and patchy sunshine,' said Nicola Maxey, of the Met Office.

Some long-range forecasters have warned that winter 2013 into January 2014 could deliver the most severe weather for more than 60 years.
