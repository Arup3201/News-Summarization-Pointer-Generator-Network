Andy Murray is set to tie the knot with Kim Sears at the £1.8million luxury hotel he owns in Scotland.

The couple are understood to be arranging the private service for April 11 at the five-star Cromlix House Hotel, close to his home town of Dunblane.

But just last summer the hotel's restaurant, which is run by renowned chef Albert Roux, failed a hygiene inspection and was issued with an 'improvement required' rating by Food Standards Agency at Stirling Council. The issue was swiftly rectified by hotel bosses.

Andy Murray and Kim Sears, pictured yesterday, are set to say 'I do' at the star's luxury Scottish hotel in April 

Andy Murray bought the five-star hotel near his hometown of Dunblane in 2013

The tennis ace proposed to his 27-year-old girlfriend of nine years with a jaw dropping three-carat diamond engagement ring, believed to be worth around £200,000, in November.

Ahead of his proposal Murray, who became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013 since 1936, was repeatedly forced to bat off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him.

The usually tight lipped star opened up about his wedding plans in an on-court interview at the recent Australian Open that he might wear a kilt with no underwear at their wedding.

Murray bought Cromlix in 2013 for £1.8 million and it opened last year after a refurbishment.

The privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes, as the hotel boasts its very own private chapel.  

The wedding party will also have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy.

Several of the luxury suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors. 

The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts.

Mr Murray and Miss Sears will also be following in the footsteps of the star's older brother, Jamie ,who also got married at Cromlix.

He wed Alejandra Guitierrez in a 2010 ceremony, in which Mr Murray acted as best man. 

Last month Jamie revealed he had not yet been asked to return the favour. 

Just weeks after it opened its doors to guests the hotel, where guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night during peak season, was named Scottish hotel of the year.

With just over two months until their big day the couple appeared relaxed as they walked their dogs near their Surrey home yesterday

Cromlix took the top prize at the Scottish Hotel Awards during a ceremony in Edinburgh with judges calling it a 'national treasure'. 

The hotel restaurant was inspected in July last year by the Food Standards Agency at Stirling Council and issued with an ‘improvement required’ rating.

At the time the FSA said the classification means that the restaurant, which is run by renowned chef Albert Roux, ‘had not achieved an acceptable level of compliance with requirements of food hygiene law’.

Bosses at the hotel, near Kinbuck, Perthshire,  insisted it was only a minor issue caused by a faulty sink, which was swiftly fixed and a new inspection was ordered.

Last week Murray, the current world number six, progressed to the final of the Australian open in Melbourne  where he was defeated by world number one Novak Djokovic.

His bride-to-be was at the centre of media controversy during the tournament after she was caught  on national television, unleashing a torrent of swear words during the semi final between Murray and Tomas Berdych,

Days later for the final Miss Sears poked fun at the row when she appeared court-side wearing a jumper that humorously declared: 'parental advisory: explicit content.'

Miss Sears is the Sussex-born daughter of the former Lawn Tennis Association Head of Women's Tennis Nigel Sears.

The couple met at the US Open in 2005 when Miss Sears was just 17 and studying for her A Level exams

Their relationship became public when Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, Scotland, won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to kiss Miss Sears

She was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005.

She was said to have been wooed by the star, who is now said to be worth of £30 million, with a series of phone calls and flowers.

The couples relationship became public when Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, Scotland, won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to kiss Miss Sears.

The sporting stars video game obsession was reportedly behind a brief separation in 2009.

But after just six months apart the romance was back on.

Murray has in the past spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11.

Murray has credited his girlfriend of nine years with helping to control his fiery temper and improving his dress sense

She is also credited with having helped control his temper on the court and with smartening up his appearance. 

‘I work better in a relationship,' he has previously said of his relationship in 2009.

'At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,.'

Andy Murray revealed in a post match interview after the Australian Open, pictured playing in the tournament, that he might wear a kilt with no underwear on the big day. Miss Sears, pictured right, caused controversy at the event after being captured on camera repeatedly swearing

The couple live in a £5.6million house in Oxshott, Surrey, with their two Border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May.

In his 2013 memoir Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, he wrote: ‘I would like to start a family and try to be a good father. That’s important to me. It’s something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’ 

Murray's mother, Judy, who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, has previously described Miss Sears as the 'best thing to happen to Andy.'
