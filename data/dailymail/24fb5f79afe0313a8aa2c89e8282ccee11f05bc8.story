Burnley boss Sean Dyche is relaxed about star striker Danny Ings' future and insists the England Under 21 international will be staying put in January.

Ings was the SkyBet Championship player of the year last season and has followed up with some impressive displays in his first Barclays Premier League campaign.

He has found the net four times for the Clarets and caught the eye with his clever hold-up play, alerting several top-flight rivals.

Danny Ings, who has scored four goals for Burnley this season, is out of contract in the summer

The 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer and with no agreement apparently imminent, Burnley are braced for approaches when the transfer window opens.

But Dyche is convinced there is no chance of the club cashing in their prize asset.

'(I have) no concerns whatsoever. I've been asked that question for the last two years.

But Burnley boss Sean Dyche has said that the club will not sell him in the January transfer window

'The chairmen (Mike Garlick and John Banaszkiewicz) have come out and said he's going nowhere and I'm happy with that as a manager.

'We have open dialogue with him and his agent.

'It's just the reality of the situation. The club have made it quite clear how much they value the players we've got and we're in a good position cash-wise because we haven't spent a lot of money.

'If anything, we're thinking about add to the squad.'
