A toddler had to be freed by firefighters after he got his head stuck in a child's loo seat.

George de Souza's parents initially thought it was 'hilarious' when the three-year-old first put the adult toilet training device round his neck.

But mother Kelly Skyring, 33, and dad Darren de Souza, 43, of Romford, Essex, began to panic when they realised they couldn't get it back off.

Mr de Souza said his son started to get upset and his other two children Kelsey, 16, and Alfie, eight, resorted to using moisturiser to try to slip the toilet seat off George's head.

After being stuck for 45 minutes, Mr de Souza decided 'the only thing he could think of' was to ring the fire brigade.

Firefighters soon arrived at the address and took 15 minutes to release the distressed toddler after they turned the seat around and wiggled it off.

Mr de Souza said: 'We thought it was hilarious to start with.

'But then George started to get upset when he realised we couldn't get it off and to be honest we started to panic a bit ourselves.

'I have no idea how he managed to get it on but it was stuck fast - it just wouldn't budge past his ears.

'The only thing I could think was that we needed the fire brigade to rescue George.

'They were brilliant ~ I don't know what we would have done without them.

'I just want to warn other parents to be aware ~ kids can get stuck in these seats. George doesn't use it any more and hasn't for a while.

'But he must have found it and decided it would make a good hat!'

Watch manager Steve West, who was part of the Harold Hill Fire Station crew called out to the de Souza home at 10pm on Wednesday last week, said: 'It's definitely one of our more unusual call-outs.

'He had been a bit upset but once we turned up he was happy and nice as pie.

'His mum said he was a big fan of the fire brigade. I think the parents were a bit panicky and didn't want to hurt him but we just turned the seat round and wiggled it off.

'I made him promise not to try it on again!'
