Maria Miller faces being censured for over-claiming for her mortgage expenses on a house she sold for £1 million profit.

The Conservative culture secretary is understood to have failed to reduce her claims when mortgage interest rates fell on the loan on her home.

It was sold on Valentine's Day this year for £1.47 million - a profit of £1,236,000 on its original price of £234,000.

She bought her house in Wimbledon, south-west London, in 1995 with her husband, but the mortgage was for more than twice the house purchase price and was increased in 2007 - when she was an MP -  to £575,000.

Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage between 2005 - when she became MP - and 2009, because Mrs Miller had designated it as her second home.

She lived there with her husband and parents but designated a rented property in Basingstoke, her constituency, as her main home.

At the time MPs were able to claim mortgage interest on their official second home, before the rules were changed in the wake of the expenses scandal.

In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property.

But – as interest rates fell in the wake of the 2008/2009 financial meltdown – she should have reduced her claims for reimbursement and failed to do. Mrs Miller faces repaying up to £5,000 and being made to apologise after delaying providing financial information to a Parliamentary inquiry into her expenses, which concludes this week, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The issue may lead to calls for Mrs Miller to quit the cabinet. But an aide for Mrs Miller insisted last night: ‘This is absolutely not a resignation issue.’

Censure: Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage. In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property which was near her parents' home

She and her husband are understood to have made a healthy profit on the Wimbledon house, which sold for £1.47million on Valentine’s Day of this year – an increase of £1,236,000.

The inquiry into Mrs Miller’s expenses started around 18 months ago.

Questions were first raised over whether the Wimbledon property was genuinely a second home as her parents, children and husband lived there, not at the Basingstoke property.

It was against rules for an MP's parents or other members of their extended family to benefit from expenses payments.

However the investigation has centred on the amounts she claimed and what her mortgage payments actually were.

The Parliamentary Commissioner is understood to have concluded that the arrangement did not lead to Mrs Miller benefiting financially.

Mrs Miller could also be asked by MPs on the standards committee to apologise to Parliament for not co-operating in a ‘timely manner’ with the commissioner.

A final report is expected before the Easter recess.

A source close to Mrs Miller said: ‘Maria has co-operated fully with the inquiry, asked for by the Labour Party, which has now been going on for a year and a half amidst constant unfounded speculation. We hope it will conclude soon.

‘It is not surprising that London houses go up in value well over a decade after they are first bought . It is also not unusual for people to move house.’

There was no prohibition on MPs making capital gains from second homes, but some promised to hand any profits to the taxpayer when they sold their houses.

Among those who have done so are Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, when he sold his constituency home in Sheffield.
