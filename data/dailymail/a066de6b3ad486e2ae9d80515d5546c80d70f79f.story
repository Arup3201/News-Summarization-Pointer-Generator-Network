One is an Anglican priest, the other a notorious hook-handed hate preacher.

Yet the friendship between Reverend Stephen Coles and Abu Hamza has endured over more than a decade.

Just a day after Euro judges ruled Hamza, who has convictions for inciting murder and hatred, could finally be extradited to the US on terror charges, Rev Coles said he would be ‘sad’ to see him go.

Rev Coles, who regularly visits extremist Hamza in Belmarsh said he would miss their chats in the high security prison.

Their unlikely connection began when 
Hamza moved into Finsbury Park Mosque in the late 1990s, which is on the
same street as St Thomas’ Anglican Church, where Rev Coles presides.

Yesterday, Rev Coles said it is 
unlikely he will ever see Hamza again - and worried he may struggle to 
stay in touch when Hamza is sent to the United States for trial.

He said: ‘He is someone with whom it 
is possible to have a conversation. You might not agree about everything
but you can have a conversation with him.

‘It’s highly unlikely - if he is extradited fairly soon - that I shall ever see him again.’

‘On one level I have a sense of slight
relief as I do not have to get myself into a high security prison which
is not a very nice experience.

‘On the other level I’m sad that the 
conversations we have been having for the last twelve or eleven years 
will come to an end. I don’t know how much it’ll be possible to keep 
contact with him.’

In an interview with Premier Christian
Radio, Rev Coles said the men were ‘both pastors’ and that they were 
able to discuss religious issues - even if they don’t always agree.

He also raised questions about the 
charges laid against Hamza, and said he was worried extraditing him to 
the US will ‘build up more and more resentment’ in Britain.

And he praised Hamza’s knowledge of 
current affairs, and said it would be wrong to jail him in a US 
‘Supermax’ high security prison.

Hamza was jailed for seven years in 
February 2006 for inciting murder and race hatred. Since serving his 
sentence he has remained in prison while fighting extradition to the US.

But according to Rev Coles he has been ‘demonised’ and ‘turned into a monster’ by the media.

The men first came into contact after 
9/11 when Hamza said of the attacks: ‘Many people will be happy, jumping
up and down at this moment.’

These comments were, Rev Coles said yesterday ‘rather outrageous’.

But nonetheless he made contact because the men were ‘both pastors working practically next door to each other’.

Hamza made him a cup of tea and, Rev Coles has said, ‘treated me like a normal human being’.

After Hamza was arrested in 2004, Rev 
Coles sent him a card to mark Eid, the festival at the end of the month 
of Ramadan, in which Muslims fast.

‘I was sending Eid cards to some of my Muslim friends and I decided that I would send one to him,’ Rev Coles said.

In the card he asked if Hamza would like to continue their conversations. Hamza wrote back he would ‘very much like to’.

Since then Rev Coles has visited Hamza two or three times a year.

Hamza also sent him a condolence card following the death of his parents.

He also gave evidence in his defence.

‘We have had conversations about all manner of different things,’ he said.

‘I always ask him about his family. I ask him about his health and how he is being treated.

‘We discuss Christianity and Muslim things and what’s going on in Finsbury Park.’

‘He is extremely well informed about what is happening in the world. I assume because he has access to television.’

He also worries about Hamza’s health 
and the treatment he receives in Belmarsh which, he says does ‘not have 
the facilities to deal with his health issues satisfactorily’.

Hamza is blind in one eye and has no arms below the elbow after they were blown off in Afghanistan.

Hamza was cleared for extradition to 
the US yesterday by the European Court of Human Rights along with four 
other terror suspects.

A grand jury in New York has indicted 
him on charges that he ran a terror training camp in Oregon in the late 
1990s and involvement in the kidnapping of 16 hostages in the Yemen in 
1998, during which four people died.

The training camp charges are, Rev Coles said on the ‘wider edges of credibility’.

‘I never ever speak to him about that 
business in the Yemen. We did speak about this so-called training camp 
in Oregon which does seem to me to be on the wider edges of credibility.

‘Given that he is here, I know you can
organise all kinds of things on the internet these days. But organising
a training camp is quite a detailed thing that you have to do.

‘And he I think felt that somebody else had been telling stories about him to implicate him.’

He said Hamza expects to spend the rest of his days in prison, and is anxious about not seeing his family if he is found guilty.

‘I think a long time ago he got used to the idea that he will probably spend the rest of his life in prison,’ he said.

‘The possibility of any real contact 
between him and his family from the moment he gets to the US - I mean 
assuming he is found guilty - is very remote.

When contacted by the Daily Mail, Rev Coles declined to comment further.

Rev Coles is openly gay and entered into a civil partnership in 2006. He is also an open advocate of gay marriage.

On its website, St Thomas’s church 
says it is an ‘open and welcoming congregation, an inclusive church that
embraces the joys and challenges of being human with all our 
differences.’
