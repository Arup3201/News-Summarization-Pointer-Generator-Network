How brave is Arsene Wenger? He’s seemingly immune from the sack at Arsenal so he’s under no pressure in his job whatsoever. So when does this manager show courage in his work?

Having faith in Yaya Sanogo at the start of this season? Was that brave? No, it was just bad management.

So after three draws and a scrappy win, Arsenal find themselves a point ahead of Manchester United in the early table. For a manager who has no pressure of the sack, 18 years at the helm, and money to spend, Wenger better pull his finger out soon.

But is he brave enough to make big decisions?

Mesut Ozil has become a lazy player for Arsenal yet his place in the starting line-up seems secure

Arsene Wenger seems incapable of dropping his £42m midfielder despite his poor level of performance

Has Arsene Wenger been cruising along like a lottery winner, safe in the knowledge he doesn't have to do anything extra special to keep his job?

Fourth place will do apparently. And Arsenal don’t even have to make it to the quarter-finals of the Champions League these days. Arsene Wenger has the safest job in football.

He has starved a club of success to the point where the fans now believe the FA Cup is the definition of success for a big club.

I guess what I’m really asking is this: has Arsene Wenger got the bottle to drop Mesut Ozil?

He’s paid £42million for a skilful footballer, but one who was always keen on clocking off mid-season. Bringing him to the Premier League where there is no winter break was always risky.

Despite his lazy performances, there seems no danger of Mesut Ozil being relegated to the subs' bench as in this match at Stoke City last season

But Ozil is being carried in the Arsenal team, just as his German colleagues carried him for most of the World Cup. He picked up a winner’s medal in Brazil by default.

Arsenal’s full-backs go forward, they need protection. There’s more chance of Joey Barton refusing to talk about himself than there is of Ozil tracking back.

His mid-season lull now lasts from August to May, with the odd glimpse of brilliance.

And in some ways I feel sorry for him.

Was he ever cut out for the speed and passion of the Premier League? Signing Mesut Ozil is simple, recognising that he isn’t the player you need would have been brilliant insight.

Mesut Ozil showed only occasional glimpses of his brilliance last season

Alexis Sanchez, by contrast, has been in excellent form so far this season and scored against Man City

So as Wenger has dithered about making big signings and spending money in the past, now he is becoming a specialist in dithering over team selection.

Ozil seems undroppable, even when his contribution to the Arsenal team cause is minimal.

I suspect it’s because Arsene Wenger refuses to see what the rest of us can all see (nothing new there then!).

While Ozil strolls around, Alexis Sanchez puts a shift in – with more quality than the German as well. The contrast between the two is breathtaking. Meantime others watch from the bench wondering why they are being left out in favour of a talented but lazy footballer.

It’s because Wenger spent a fortune on him, and he hasn’t got the balls to drop him.
