At the time, Healey wore no shirt, exposed his genitals, brandished his arms and yelled while he walked in the vicinity of Sherwood Elementary School, deputies said in an incident report obtained by the outlet. Callers also described a man throwing himself against cars and trees in 911 calls.

Citing the incident report, the newspaper reported that  Deputy John Beard fired a stun gun three times while Healey resisted arrest. Beard and another deputy, Eric Anderson, later got Healey onto the ground, used the stun gun another two times and put his legs in shackles.

Healey was taken to a hospital and was put on life support after he had trouble breathing, the incident report stated. 

The Escambia County Sheriff's Office told The Pensacola News Journal that Healey's family took him off of life support on Monday.

Father Craig Healey told the newspaper 'I have a granddaughter who doesn't have a dad now. My son is a 130 pound guy. If two officers had come upon the scene and it had been their son, I can guarantee their son wouldn't be dead right now.'

'There is no indication on our end that there was any violation of protocol by the deputies. Not just from the officers' standpoint, but also from witnesses,' Sheriff David Morgan told The Pensacola News Journal. 

Police discovered at Healey's house a spice drug called 'Kick Brains,' NorthEscambia.com reported. 

Sheriff Morgan told  WEAU 'We had two deputies in a very scary situation. I mean two armed people show up and yet I've got someone who was willing to fight with us. I think we should wait for that toxicology report to come back.'

Craig Healey told the affiliate station 'I know he doesn't do spice, so I know it wasn't spice. He may have taken something I don't know.'

'The Escambia County Sheriff's Department killed my son. They tased him to death,' Debra Lamberti, Cody Healey's mother, told WEAU

An autopsy is being performed.
