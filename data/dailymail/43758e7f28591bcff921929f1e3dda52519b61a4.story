The Queen has launched a discreet campaign to ensure that Prince Charles, Prince William – and eventually baby George – inherit her role as Head of the Commonwealth.

Contrary to popular belief, the position does not extend to her successors.

However, the Queen wants David Cameron to use a summit later this year to urge Commonwealth leaders to change its rules so that her son, grandson and great-grandson take on the role when they become King.

The Palace believes Commonwealth joy over the birth of George provides the ideal opportunity to guarantee the British Monarchy does not lose its most prominent international platform when the Queen dies.

Her position as Head of the Commonwealth was secured in the ‘London Declaration’ of 1949, three years before she acceded to the Throne. But, crucially, it did not state her heirs would take over.

Technically, it is up to the leaders of the 54 countries that make up the Commonwealth to decide who will replace her as Head.

But if the Buckingham Palace initiative succeeds, the job would be secured for future British Monarchs when the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) takes place in Sri Lanka in November.

International platform: The Queen wants her son Prince Charles and subsequent monarchs to also be Head of the Commonwealth

A pledge at the summit that Charles and his heirs would succeed the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth would avoid nations such as Australia and Jamaica – where there are vocal republican movements – using the meeting as an opportunity to demand a break in the link with the British Monarchy.

Evidence of covert diplomatic manoeuvres by the Palace is revealed in a subtle change on the website of the London-based Commonwealth Secretariat, the organisation’s official HQ.

Until recently the section on the ‘Head of the Commonwealth’ stated that although the Queen occupied the position, it ‘does not pass automatically to her heir’.

Good timing: The Queen has chosen a moment while the Royal family is at its most popular to launch her campaign

This has been quietly removed in recent weeks. Foreign Office insiders say this is part of a discreet campaign. Charles will attend the CHOGM alongside Mr Cameron.

The Queen will miss the biennial event for the first time because of Prince Philip’s ill-health and controversy over staging it in Sri Lanka, which has a poor human rights record.

‘It would be awful if, when the Queen dies, there was a political wrangle in the Commonwealth over whether Charles should follow her,’ said one diplomat.

‘Removing the reference on the  Commonwealth Secretariat website to the fact the British Monarch does not automatically get the Commonwealth job was a clear signal.

There are one of two ambitious, rather distasteful figures in the Commonwealth who could use this uncertainty to try to grab the job vacated by the Queen.

‘If David Cameron asks Commonwealth leaders to secure the role for little George, few could object.’

Critics say appointing a hereditary figure to lead the Commonwealth undermines its efforts to spread democracy. But supporters say it emphasises the Commonwealth’s character as a ‘unique family of nations’ rather than a political, UN-style organisation.
