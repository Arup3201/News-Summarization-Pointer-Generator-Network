A woman has made a desperate plea to stop a local council killing her dog Hugo after he was captured while wondering off his lead near her home.

Lynette Mcilveen, from Hope Island on the Gold Coast, has been told by authorities they plan to destroy her pet in ten days. 

The distraught dog owner has blasted the council and told the Today Show on Tuesday they have 'made a decision based on fear.'

Two-year-old Hugo was found wandering without a lead at about 4.30pm on August 20 after escaping from his home.

Gold Coast woman Lynette McIlveen claims she has been told by authorities that they plan to destroy her pet dog Hugo in ten days

The council have argued he was also found to be responsible for rushing at a dog and its owner in Charles Holm Park at 6.30am on 20 February 2014.

However, Ms Mcilveen argued that Hugo is not dangerous. 'He's playful, his tail would have been wagging... but obviously Hugo is a big dog,' she said.

She has started a petition to save her family's Shar Pei and it has already received over 700 signatures.

'This is important because Hugo is innocent .... he is a friendly dog who has been treated unjustly because we have neglected to see that our inability to be vigilant has led to our boy being detained and threatened with death.

'He is our family member...we love him, he means everything to us. Please don't do this to Hugo.'

'We love him': Hugo's owners have claimed he is a friendly family dog who doesn't deserve to die 

'Obviously he's a big dog': Ms Mcilveen has argued Hugo is 'playful, his tail would have been wagging' when he approached people off his lead

Hugo is currently being kept in a concrete cage at a compound by the council and Ms Mcilveen has been visiting him daily.

She has begged for him to be brought home and has promised she will not let him off his lead again.

'You have picked the wrong animal. Hugo doesn't deserve to die because our family has neglected to do what the council asks... we love him he's our boy.

'It's not Hugo's fault, we are responsible for this, it will never ever happen again.'

The Courier Mail reports Hugo's owners have admitted they once told Gold Coast City Council the animal was dead to avoid it being taken.

A spokesperson for Gold Coast council told Daily Mail Australia: 'The owner has been told they have 14 days to appeal the notice and they are well within their rights.'

Cry for help:  Hugo's family have set up a Facebook page to help raise awareness of their plight. It already has over 11,000 fans

Promises: The family has pleaded that they will not let the Shar Pei off his lead again

'We are not going to be swayed by public opinion. The dog was surrendered to us by the owner, they took it to the pound after we issued the destruction notice on 22 August. We didn't take it from the yard.'

'Destruction notices are a last resort for the council... it's not a decision we take lightly,' they added.

In an official statement the council said: 'The destruction of regulated dogs is the last resort for City of Gold Coast, which works with all dog owners to ensure the public’s safety is protected.

'Public safety must take precedent over poor behaviour from dog owners that sees their animals roaming the streets and menacing people and other dogs.

Last resort: The Gold Coast council said the destruction of regulated dogs is the last resort for them

'Running with an order to kill him': The council said a destruction order was issued on 22 August. The owner surrendered the dog to the pound and has 14 days to appeal, the council added

'Council is restricted from listing the details of offences involving this dog but it has been involved in numerous incidents.

'Council will give the appeal every consideration.

Ms Mcilveen has also started a Facebook page for Hugo that now has over 11,000 likes.

On Monday night she wrote: 'Good night my boy Hugo, I love you and know how horrible it is for you at this time. I pray for you to be returned to us soon and Hugo just look how many love you…Hang in there big boy for we are never going to give up on you.

'Tomorrow is the another day and one day closer to you coming home, I miss you so much, I love you.'
