Southampton manager Ronald Koeman refused to shake hands with Sheffield United counterpart Nigel Clough after a feisty Capital One Cup tie ended in a 1-0 victory for the underdogs.

Koeman was clearly upset by the non-stop 'verbals' dished out by Clough and his assistant Chris Morgan to fourth official Paul Tierney with Morgan, a former Blades captain, sent to the stands after Marc McNulty had scored the 63rd minute winner.

Koeman said afterwards: 'I only shake hands with people who have respect for me as a coach, who have respect for the fourth official.

'The behaviour of the bench of Sheffield United, I have never seen that (before). That was the reason I didn't shake hands.'

Clough was irritated that Koeman's snub might overshadow a heroic win for the League One side, who also reached last season's FA Cup semi-final.

'It was a remarkable effort by the players and we thoroughly deserved the win. We had a lad from Ilkeston Town out there, a 17-yearr-old in midfield and a right winger at right back.

'Not a lot is going to disappoint us, you will have to ask him (why he didn't shake hands).'

Asked directly about Koeman's accusation the Sheffield bench had been disrespectful to the officials, Clough snapped: 'It is his opinion.'
