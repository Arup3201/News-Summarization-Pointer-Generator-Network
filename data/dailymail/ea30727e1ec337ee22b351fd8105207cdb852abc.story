Rupert Murdoch’s daughter has bought a luxury home for £38.5million just days after it was revealed her marriage was over.

TV boss Elisabeth Murdoch, 46, bought the secluded detached house following revelations she and 50-year-old PR guru Matthew Freud were divorcing.

The home in St John’s Wood, north-west London, includes a main seven-bedroom brick house in front of a three-bedroom mews home.

Luxury: The 12,723 sq ft house is described as an ‘ambassadorial residence’ with a driveway that has space for up to ten cars

A local property source told the London Evening Standard: ‘She exchanged and completed on Friday.’

The couple, worth a total of £260million, are divorcing amid rumours of a conflict between Mr Freud and his father-in-law.

Miss Murdoch’s new 12,723 sq ft house is described as an ‘ambassadorial residence’ with a driveway that has space for up to ten cars.

It dates back to the 1920s and was on the market for £40million before being bought by Miss Murdoch, reported the Standard.

After a refurbishment the home has a main bedroom suite with separate bathrooms and dressing rooms, five bedrooms with en suite bathrooms.

It also comes with a 725 sq ft drawing room with bow windows, while the ground floor has a 38ft-long formal dining room with capacity to seat 20 people.

And on the lower ground floor of the air-conditioned home, Miss Murdoch has a cinema room, gym, ‘massage room’ and games room.

Miss Murdoch joins other high-profile buyers in moving to St John’s Wood, such as fashion designer Stefano Gabbana and artist Damien Hirst.

One local agent told the Standard: ‘Marylebone is the new Mayfair and has made these parts of north London fashionable and interesting again.

‘It is now perceived to be desirable and good value compared with Mayfair and Belgravia.’

Earlier this month Miss Murdoch was seen without her wedding ring as it emerged she was to divorce Mr Freud after 13 years.

Mr Freud and Miss Murdoch who have two children aged 13 and seven, were expected to be granted a decree nisi last week.

Sources said one factor in the breakdown of their marriage was the antagonism between the PR chief and Mr Murdoch.

Mr Freud took the side of his old friend Mr Blair when his 83-year-old father-in-law filed for divorce from Wendi Deng, 45, last year.

It happened after he had become angered by claims the former prime minister met his wife several times without his knowledge.

Friends of Mr Blair have always insisted his relationship with Miss Deng is entirely platonic. Relations between Mr Freud and Mr Murdoch then soured further.

This culminated in him banning his father-in-law from attending his 50th birthday party at his £8million Oxfordshire mansion last November.

Mr Freud said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way.

‘Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted.

‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’

The couple are expected to split their £260million fortune equally.

Miss Murdoch personally made £130million in 2011 when she sold her TV production company Shine, whose hit programmes include MasterChef, to her father’s company News Corporation.

Her husband, who is the great-grandson of psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud, founded PR company Freud Communications and is worth an estimated £100million.

They met in 1997, when they were both married to other people, and were immediately attracted to each other.

Having left their spouses, Miss Murdoch and Mr Freud had their first child, Charlotte, in November 2000.

They briefly separated before marrying at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2001. Their second child, Samson, was born in January 2007.

The couple’s parties were legendary for their heady mix of celebrities, senior politicians, media stars and colourful entrepreneurs.

Their combined wealth was estimated at £260million in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranked them as one of the top 25 wealthiest couples in the UK.
