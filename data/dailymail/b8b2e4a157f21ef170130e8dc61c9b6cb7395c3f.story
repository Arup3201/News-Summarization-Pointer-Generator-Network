The Rugby Football League will from now on allow clubs an extra interchange in the event of a player needing a pitchside concussion assessment.

It is one of four rule changes that will come into effect in the First Utility Super League, Kingstone Press Championship and League 1 and Challenge Cup in the 2015 season.

The RFL said: 'The change is designed to safeguard players against the unseen dangers of concussion by removing any sub-conscious pressure on medical staff to not be over-cautious in removing a player from the field for an assessment.'

The four law changes aim to make life easier for referees and 'enhance the matchday experience'

Currently, each team can make a total of 12 changes during the match.

The RFL's Laws Committee has also tried to clear up the confusion over obstruction, which will let the referee 'allow play to continue unless the defending team has been materially disadvantaged'.

On-field officials must now also signal for a decision before going to the video referee, who would then have to find 'sufficient evidence' to overturn the ruling, a system that was used in the NRL and the international Four Nations tournament.

Referees will also have only four rather than seven main areas in which sin-binning is deemed to be the appropriate course of action, helping the official reduce the number of 'on report' decisions.

RFL chief executive Nigel Wood, who chairs the Laws Committee, said: 'The changes will enhance the matchday experience for players, spectators, coaches and TV viewers alike by making the laws of the game as simple and unambiguous as possible.

'The Laws Committee took into consideration views from across the game and I am sure the changes will be well received by everyone involved.'
