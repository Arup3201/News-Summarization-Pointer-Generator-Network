The tennis world's female stars have walked the red carpet for one last party before Wimbledon swings into action - with Maria Sharapova dressed in the tournament's traditional white.

The French Open champion arrived at the event in style, in a Porsche driven by Australian racing driver Mark Webber.

Speaking at the Women's Tennis Association party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington, west London, Sharapova said: 'It's definitely the entrance you want to have to a players' party.'

The tennis
 star, dressed in a short white dress, said Wimbledon has a 'very 
special' feel to it. 'It's a beautiful venue. There's so much tradition 
and around the town there's so much excitement in the lead up to such a 
big tournament.

'It's
 a big draw with so many players competing and it's over two weeks so 
it's just nice to see all the fans follow their favourites and cheer for
 them.'The environment is very special when you walk out on to the court,' she said at Thursday night's event.

Having
 just won the French Open, the Russian player said she was 'so happy', 
adding: 'It's such a quick turnaround between the French Open and 
Wimbledon, and you just hope that you recover both mentally and 
physically, because it was a very physical Grand Slam for me.

'I
 always look forward to Wimbledon, so no matter how I did in Paris you 
have to turn the page quite quickly and get ready and spend as many 
hours as you can on the grass.'

With the tournament set to start on Monday, World No 1 Serena Williams attended the annual event along with fellow Wimbledon hopefuls Ana Ivanovic, Ajla Tomljanovic and Andrea Petkovic.

Venus Williams arrived at the party in a sequinned green dress and said there was no rivalry between her and her sister Serena.

'I'm so happy to see her win,' she said, adding: 'Hopefully one of us can win again.'

Young Brit Laura Robson also made an appearance at the party and posed for photographs on the red carpet in west London.

The 20-year-old was at Wimbledon on Thursday larking around with Maria Sharapova, as she visited the French Open winner's first pop-up sweet store Sugarpova, which is open in Wimbledon Village until the tournament finishes on July 6.
