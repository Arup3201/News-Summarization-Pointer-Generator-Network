A self-proclaimed 'psycho' killer jailed for blasting a student in the head at point-blank range has bragged in a letter to a friend that he could serve his 30-year term 'standing on my head'.

Kiaran Stapleton, 21, said he had 'the best cell' on his wing and spent his time watching soaps.

His letter - littered with misspellings - emerged just days after he launched an appeal against his sentence for the unprovoked shooting of 23-year-old Anuj Bidve, who had come to Britain from India to study micro-electronics.

Caloous: Kiaran 'Psycho' Stapleton, left, 21, was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Indian Anuj Bidve, right, 23, in the head and stood laughing over his body in Salford, Manchester, on Boxing Day 2011

Despite his sickening boast, the 
21-year-old has begged a judge to reduce his sentence, which he is 
currently serving at York's tough Full Sutton Prison.

Stapleton, who gave his name as 'Psycho' in court after the shooting in Salford on Boxing Day last year wrote In a letter, revealed by The Sun, that he 'knows loads of people' and 'never gets grief from enybody (sic)'.

Instead, he says, he whiles away his days in 'the best cell on the wing' waiting for his favourite soaps to begin while feeding on sweets.

'30 isent (sic) that long I don't think enyway I can do it standing on my head "ha"', he wrote.

'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation Street and eating chocolate.'

The letter emerged after its outraged recipient passed it to the tabloid newspaper yesterday.

I've got the best cell on the wing': And despite his sickening boast, Stapleton has begged a judge to reduce his sentence, which he is currently serving at York's tough Full Sutton Prison

The source told the paper: 'It's 
clear Stapleton doesn't care that he's in prison. He thinks he has a 
cushy life there. It's disgusting.'

Stapleton has appealed for his sentence to be reduced at the Court of Appeal.

It is believed he has pleaded for his age and mental health problems to be taken into account.

The judges have reserved judgement for a date yet to be fixed.

Stapleton was found guilty of murder in July for killing Mr Bidve in 'a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression'.

'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation St and Eastenders eating pure chocolate and other ****.

'Have got the best cell on the wing and nare 30 isent (sic) that long I dont think enyway.

'I can do it standing on my head "ha"'

Police have never established a motive
for the cold-blooded attack by Stapleton, then 19.

Bidve had arrived in the UK to study 
micro-electronics at Lancaster University and was visiting Manchester 
with a group of friends last Christmas.

They left their hotel in Salford to queue early for the sales when their paths crossed with Stapleton’s.

He calmly walked across the road and repeatedly asked for the time.

When someone finally answered he pulled a handgun out of his pocket and fired one shot to Mr Bidve’s left temple.

Stapleton told one psychologist in prison that he picked out his victim because 'he had the biggest head', the court heard.

The
day after the murder he booked into a hotel which overlooked the crime 
scene in Ordsall Lane and then later went to a tattoo parlour and had a 
teardrop design placed below his right eye - a symbol used by some gangs
to mark that the wearer has killed someone.

But after officers revealed CCTV 
footage of him close to the scene and trying to burn his clothes in his 
back garden, he tried to blame a friend, before eventually admitting the
manslaughter of Mr Bidve on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

He claimed he had a personality disorder which affected his self-control.

Sentencing him in July, Mr 
Justice King told Stapleton: 'In my judgment, this was no impulsive act 
on your part. It was a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression.'

He
said he had showed a 'most callous disregard' in laughing and smirking 
after he gunned down Mr Bidve and also during the trial.

'You have behaved in a way demonstrating that you are positively boastful about having killed Mr Bidve,' he said.

Following the sentencing, Mr Bidve’s father, Subhash,
a former Indian Air Force officer, who attended every day of the trial 
with his wife, Yogini, spoke movingly of how Stapleton had turned his 
family’s hopes and dreams into a ‘living nightmare’.

He said: ‘When Anuj came to the United
Kingdom in September 2011 he was the man who was going to fulfil our 
hopes and dreams. Instead, in the early hours of Boxing Day morning, 
Stapleton cold-bloodedly and brutally murdered our son.

‘Stapleton had never met our son and 
did not know anything about him. Stapleton, in the blink of an eye, and 
the time it took a bullet to leave the gun he was holding, turned Anuj’s
hopes and dreams into our living and continuous nightmare.'

The letter was revealed as Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he wanted to stop prisons being seen as places convicts enjoyed being in. He plans to review perks such as watching satellite TV and access to social networking sites.
