Manchester United's tricky trip to Preston on Monday night did not get off to the best of starts when the team's kit van was locked out.

The red transit, captured in a tweet from BBC's North West Tonight, pulled up at Deepdale only to find the doors to the away dressing rooms closed.

Up until last season United brought the kit on the team bus.

But thanks to an enlarged backroom staff, a double decker model was commissioned which does not have as much room for cargo underneath.

Stewards were alerted and the issue was resolved.
