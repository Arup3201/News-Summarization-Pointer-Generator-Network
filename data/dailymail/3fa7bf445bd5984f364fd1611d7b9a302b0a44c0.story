They were among the most poignant symbols of the recession, hundreds of unfinished Irish housing estates that had to be abandoned following the credit crunch of the late 2000s.

But now demolition has begun on some of the last of the remaining ghost estates, built during the economic boom of 'Celtic Tiger' years but now deemed 'not economically viable'.

Between the mid-1990s and 2007, Irish developers flocked to build new homes, spurred on by the easy availability of credit, cheap labour from eastern Europe and a vibrant Dublin property market.

But then the bottom fell out and by 2010 there were an estimated  600 ghost estates in 
Ireland with an estimated 300,000 homes lying empty.

Some unlucky buyers were caught in the middle of the crash and found themselves trapped living in dangerous, unfinished properties next to rows of empty buildings.

In 2009, the Irish government announced that it would invest €20m in properties on ghost estates to use for social housing, but the plan was widely criticised because of the lack of basic amenities such as schools on the estates.

As a result many were simply neglected and left to fall into disrepair. In February 2012, a two-year-old boy died after drowning in a pool of water on an unfinished ghost estate.

Slashed: During the economic boom, Irish developers attempted to cash in, building tens of thousands of houses. However, poor planning decisions and the global recession have resulted in a large number of estates being abandoned, unoccupied or unfinished

Brick by brick: Demolition begins on the last few standing units at the condemned Glenatore 'Ghost Housing Estate' in Athlone

Toddler Liam Keogh is understood to have followed the family dog from his home through a fence into a section of the Glenatore housing estate in Athlone, Co. Westmeath.

The tragedy brought the problem of the ghost estates sharply into focus.

Those which clearly had no future, lacking basic infrastructure such as roads, lighting, and schools, were deeemed economically unviable and earmarked for demolition.

According to figures published in November, since 2010 the number of completed but vacant housing units fell by 72 per cent from 23,250 to 6,350 while the number of unfinished developments fell by 55.8 per cent from 2,846 to 1,258.

In October, the Government said it would allocate €10million to resolving the problem of ghost estates and last month Irish Housing Minister Jan O’Sullivan ordered a further 40 of the worst ghost estates should be pulled down at the developers' expense.

Despite a long-slow and difficult recovery Irish property prices remain almost 50% below their peak in 2007.

Over the past three years the number of ghost estates has fallen by as estimated 56 per cent, with some finally being completed but many being torn down
