The big four supermarkets have lost sales worth £4.4billion a year -  squeezed on one side by budget stores, Aldi and Lidl, and upmarket Waitrose on the other.

The unprecedented switch has occurred over the last three years and comes against the background of a punishing cost of living crisis.

Aldi’s sales growth has accelerated to a remarkable 33.5per cent a year, while takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 16.5per cent.

The huge rise in shoppers and sales means Aldi’s share of UK grocery sales is now running at 4.3per cent, while the Lidl share is 3.2per cent.

These figures may appear small, but they are taking a huge chunk of sales from middle-market supermarkets like Tesco, Morrisons and Asda.

The budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years.

Fresh fillet steak, produce, cheap dairy products and award winning European food and wine have seen their car parks packed with BMWs and Volvos.

Tesco’s market share over the last 12 weeks compared to a year ago is down from 29.6per cent to 28.7per cent, while Morrisons is down from 11.8per cent and Asda from 17.8per cent to 17.5per cent.

Tesco and Morrisons have responded to the threat posed by the so-called ‘hard discounters’ by launching a price war on milk and some other essentials.

Tesco has cut the price of a four pint carton to £1 to match budget chains, while Morrisons has cut the price of a two litre carton to 84p, which is 24p a pint.

Meanwhile takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 16.5per cent

The figures come from analysts, Kantar Worldpanel, whose director, Chris Longbottom, said: ‘Aldi’s year-on-year growth rate accelerated to a record 33.5per cent meaning the retailer now accounts for 4.3per cent of the market while Lidl held on to the record 3.2per cent it reached last period. 

'Despite this, Waitrose shrugged off the pressure from the discounters with its highest ever market share of 5per cent.

‘Over the past three years Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl have taken a combined 3.5 share points from the competition which equates to £4.4 billion per year.

‘This has put pressure on the big four supermarkets to compete for a shrinking middle ground and cut prices to directly combat the discounters.’

Among the big four, Sainsbury’s was the only retailer to hold its market share year-on-year at 17.0% and match the overall market growth of 2.2per cent.

The Co-operative has improved on historical performance with positive sales growth of 0.7% and only a marginal drop in share to 6.1per cent.

Kantar said grocery prices are rising at an annual rate of 1.9per cent, which is the lowest level since July 2010 and so offers some respite for hard-pressed household budgets.
