The TV watchdog has launched an investigation into ITV2 show On The Pull which failed to be recommissioned last week following a public outcry over central character Dapper Laughs.

More than 68,000 people and 44 comedians signed a petition calling for the programme, featuring comedian Daniel O'Reilly, to be banned as it was giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'. 

Mr O'Reilly, 25, also saw his UK stand-up tour cancelled after telling an audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'.   

Appearing on BBC's Newsnight last week, the comedian said that he was retiring his Dapper Laughs persona and moaned that the complaints against him had 'wrecked his life'.

Ofcom has launched an investigation into ITV2 show On The Pull which failed to be recommissioned last week following a public outcry over central character Dapper Laughs

He found internet fame on Vine and Twitter - leading to his TV show - as south London 'lad' Dapper Laughs, who engaged women in 'banter' in the name of comedy. 

The show, which aimed to teach men to be better at 'pulling', included stunts such as asking for women's numbers in the street and featured a catalogue of degrading catchphrases.

Broadcast regulator Ofcom announced today that it is looking into whether the show fell foul of broadcasting rules and was offensive to viewers.

A spokesman for the regulator said: 'Ofcom is currently investigating whether the repeated use of sexual references in this comedy series met generally accepted standards.'

Laddish: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'

While on Newsnight last week, Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality.

He said: 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian.

'The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.'

At the time I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you.

'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular.

'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.'

The ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on November 3. 

Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality

He said he took the decision to cancel the tour after deciding he did not want to perform as the character any more.

'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me,' he said. 'I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.'

His bids to defend himself previously led to even more anger.

Defending claims the show encouraged rape, he told a live audience: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go "Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later".'

He was later heard telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape' before adding 'do you want to come backstage after, yeah? Bring two of your mates, you’ll need them'.

An ITV spokesman said: 'We have given careful thought to the recent criticism of the character Dapper Laughs, which has focused on his activities outside of the ITV2 programme, whose content was carefully considered and complied.  

'We have taken the decision that we will not be considering this show for a second series.'

Face-off: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled by the BBC's Emily Maitlis as he revealed he is retiring his 'character'

EMILY MAITLIS: Dan O'Reilly, at best what you do is offensive, at worst it incites harassment and violence.

DANIEL O'REILLY: Mm. No, d'you know what, from the beginning when I started the character Dapper Laughs it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people... In the end it became really popular and I kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you.

EM: When you see that now, what do you think?

DOR: If that was the first time I'd seen that kind of comedy I'd think the character is not setting a good example, but at the time when we were doing it, it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing... I thought maybe y'know these people could see that I'm, cos, saying that, obviously to me, it's like c'mon, that's not, that's not real, obviously I don't think that, but I, I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think, d'you what I mean?

EM: Right. So when you say you're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say 'get your g*** out' to women, can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street?

DOR: Yeah potentially of course, you're right, it's, it's, y'know, it's wrong, but, to, well I'm not going to say but, but to me, I didn't see it as me that was saying that, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular.

EM: So you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence...

DOR: I didn't think it did at the time, I thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.

EM: You've said Dapper Laughs is an extension of yourself. He allows you to do things you wouldn't normally do and you blame it on him. Doesn't sound like satire at all, it sounds like an excuse.

DOR: Well that's not the attitude that I did have with it. D'you know what, to be completely honest with you, it was great at the beginning for me, it's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian.

EM: Just another line that came up, 'Just show her your penis, if she cries she's playing hard to get'. There's a bit in the film we saw where you're holding up a knife and you say 'Lift up your f****** shirt. Was that all just done in jest?

DOR: No disrespect to you, looking at me now, do you think I'd go out and do that? I was creating, I was pushing the boundaries of that character.

EM: But what you're saying is that women who say no don't mean no, and if people watching that think it's funny and they go and enact that, then that's the consequence...

DOR: That makes me sad to think if someone had done that and I was responsible for that it's terrible. That's why this week with the bad press and everything that's happened, I've stopped and said, y'know, it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.

EM: So you're feeling like a bit of a victim now, are you?

DOR: I wouldn't say that, maybe a victim of my own mistakes.
