The World's Best Airline for 2014 has been crowned, with Cathay Pacific flying past last year's winner Emirates to take out the top spot.

Along with the title for the year, the airline also nabbed a record, becoming the only carrier to win the prestigious award four times after claiming the title in 2003, 2005 and 2009.

Australian airline Qantas slipped out of the top 10 for the second time, coming in at number 11. Last year Qantas ranked 10th, and its highest position was in 2008 when it was named third in the world.

It comes after some setbacks for the airline this year, including job losses and questions over foreign ownership.

Qantas suffered some bad press earlier this month when a leaking pipe caused water to flood the cabin on the upper deck of a flight from LA to Melbourne

Earlier this month the airline suffered some bad press when an Airbus A380 bound for Melbourne was forced to turn back after water flooded the aisles.

A leaking pipe caused water to spill into the upper deck cabin, prompting some passengers to share photos on social media - including American actress Yvette Nicole Brown, best known for her role on the sitcom Community.

Malaysian Airline, previously a top 10 airline on three different occasions, experienced a sharp decline in the wake of MH370's disappearance, now ranked at 18th.

The annual World Airlines Award announcement came at the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK, and the awards are based on research by aviation firm Skytrax.

Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Ivan Chu told The Sydney Morning Herald that he was 'extremely proud, for both Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong' to receive the award.

Second and third place were given to Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, while Emirates slipped to fourth from first place in 2013.

Locally, it was better news for Qantas as they were named the Best Airline in the Australia/Pacific region. Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand rounded out the top three.

The ranking also includes divisons for best cabin crew, which was taken out by Garuda Indonesia, and the best first class cabin, awarded to Singapore Airlines.

Qatar was ranked in the top spot for the best business class while Korean airline Asiana had the best economy class cabin.

Jetstar was the fourth best budget airline, with AirAsia and AirAsiaX coming in first and second.

The Sydney Morning Herald report that the Skytrax Awards survey nearly 19 million airline passengers from 160 countries worldwide to come up with the results.

The World Airline Awards are non-for-profit and free from any third party influence, and any airline passenger worldwide can cast a vote.

In June Etihad Airways tried to withdraw from the rankings, citing a disagreement with the rating system but despite this came in ninth overall. As airlines are chosen by consumers they cannot be omitted form the awards.
