A British teenager has been left fighting for his life after he was stripped naked and 'stabbed 17 times' during an attack in a Turkish holiday resort.

Ward, was found in a garden
 in the Tepe district of Marmaris, a popular holiday haunt for 
British tourists. Two men have now been arrested in connection with the incident.

The 17-year-old was discovered on Tuesday with at least 10 stab wounds to the body and taken to the intensive care unit of the Marmaris State Hospital. He is reportedly in a critical condition.

relation to the incident.

 Thursday morning and shortly after Ismail A, 24, from Aksaray, was 
arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles away.

Using information believed to have 
come from Dincer, Turkish police in Mugla liased with other forces 
across the country - tracking Ismail on a bus heading for his home town.

Ismail was taken from the bus at Konya and is being transferred back to Marmaris to undergo questioning.

Mr Ward's blood-stained, naked body was spotted and photographed lying in a garden at around 7.30am on Tuesday by local residents.

They called the emergency services 
and a doctor managed to stabilise the teenager at the scene before he 
was rushed to intensive care.

Two British men are believed to have died in separate drowning incidents in Turkey, while a teenager is fighting for his life after he was stabbed ten times

Marmaris police immediately launched a major investigation into the 
alleged attack andall leave was cancelled as they desperately tried to track down the attackers.

Within 48 hours police had checked 217 cameras covering the town's Bar Street and surrounding areas.

Careful examination of the camera's showed Dwayne leaving Bar Street and then a few hundred yards further on two men were seen following him and taking hold of his arms.

According
 to police and hospital reports Dwaine had been stabbed more than a 
dozen times including twice in the throat and several times in the 
chest. It is said to have pierced his heart.

It is said he had also been stabbed in the groin, legs and back and his arms had been slashed with a razor.

People on Belcekiz beach called paramedics after noticing that a body, believed to be that of Anthony Gissing, was floating in the sea without moving

The attack took place after the young 
man and his older brother, said to be 32, had been out drinking in the 
town's Bar Street on Monday night.

The brothers had reportedly become separated among the crowds and Darren had returned to their hotel alone.

The
 brothers are believed to be on holiday with their mother- staying at 
the privately run Ali Baba Otel close to the town's busy market place.

Speaking
 from the Ali Baba Otel, yesterday morning his mother said: 'Dwaine's 
facing another operation this morning. His dad's flying out from the UK 
to be with him.

'I'm too distressed to talk about it.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed hospitalisation of the teenager.
