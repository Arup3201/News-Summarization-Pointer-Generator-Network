Dave King has insisted he would have no problem convincing the authorities that he is ‘fit and proper’ to become an Ibrox director as he described the current Rangers board as ‘one of the worst the club has ever had’.

The crisis-torn club announced plans on Monday to fight King’s bid to oust chairman David Somers, chief executive Derek Llambias, finance director Barry Leach and director James Easdale at an egm to be held within the next six weeks.

King needs to win 51 per cent of the vote if he is to succeed in replacing the unpopular current directors with himself, fellow ex-Rangers director Paul Murray and John Gilligan, the former managing director of Glasgow brewer Tennent’s.

But, in a clear reference to King paying £44million in South Africa after pleading guilty to contravening tax laws, the board told the stock exchange on Monday: ‘The rules require that all individuals appointed to the board of an AIM company are suitable to be a director of a UK public company.’

In addition to the AIM market, King and Murray will also have to convince the SFA they are ‘fit and proper’ people to be directors after previously being on the board at Ibrox prior to Craig Whyte leading the club into administration and then liquidation.

Yet King said: ‘There are no problems regarding the AIM regulations and the issue with the SFA is simple. Only once a director is appointed is an application made to the SFA by the club.

‘Both myself and Paul will have to deal with our previous directorship at the time that Craig Whyte got involved. Additionally, I will have to deal with my reasons for staying on the board and trying to impose some level of governance during the Whyte era.

‘I will also deal with my favourable settlement in South Africa.

‘These are all issues that the SFA rightly has to address in the same way that the SFA has to review the history of anyone who gets involved with a Scottish football team.

Off-field politics have prompted numerous protests from Rangers fans this season

‘That was all considered by me prior to my application - as was the likelihood that the incumbent board will use the media to try and influence the debate by misrepresentation.

‘The enthusiasm that this board adopts to ‘media management’ and its failure to act in the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders is exactly why they should be jettisoned in favour of directors who have the requisite business skills and respect for the tradition of Rangers to take the club forward.

‘History will judge this board as one of the worst the club has ever had. There is not one individual who puts the club above personal interest.’

King’s salvo came after Rangers called on him to drop his call for a General Meeting on Monday morning and to save the financially-stricken club the expense of hosting it.

The board’s 7am statement added: ‘If the notice (issued by King) is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions.’

In a second statement, the under-fire Rangers directors conceded they may have to consider using Ibrox as security on a loan - but insisted any decision would not be ‘taken lightly’.

Shareholders arrive at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow, ahead of the 2014 Rangers AGM.

Fans protested against that possibility before Friday night’s abandoned clash with Hearts after it was revealed Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley - who owns an 8.92-per-cent stake in Rangers - had applied for security over both the stadium and Murray Park as part of a £10million loan arrangement.

The so-called Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - had already announced they would increase their own loan offer of £5m but would not ask for security on the stadium.

The board added: ‘The directors are pursuing bilateral discussions with two parties who are both stakeholders in Rangers.

‘These discussions contemplate a significant amount of capital being available to the business on a long-term basis in order to enhance the squad which the directors believe is necessary.

‘A consequence of funding to this level is that, in reality, it may be necessary to use Ibrox stadium as security; such a decision would not be taken lightly.

‘No decision has been taken at the current time while discussions are being finalised in good faith.

‘The advance notice does not mean that security will be given, and the directors are adamant that it will not unfairly advantage the party with whom it was agreed.

‘The board will conclude a transaction, based on its merits, which it believes is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole in accordance with their fiduciary duty.’
