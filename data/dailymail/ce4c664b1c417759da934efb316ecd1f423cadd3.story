Home Secretary Theresa May faces opposition from Eurosceptic MPs. A vote is scheduled for Monday

Theresa May has backed down in a battle over keeping Britain in the controversial European Arrest Warrant system.

The Home Secretary infuriated Eurosceptic MPs this week by giving them less than a week to digest her proposals before voting on Monday.

She wants to opt out of 130 EU measures on justice and home affairs and retain 35, including the arrest warrants.

A Government source said the Tory whips’ office had been thrown into ‘panic’ by the scale of opposition to her plan. 

She was warned the Government faced defeat if Labour joined with Tory Eurosceptics to call for a delay.

But in a major shift yesterday Mrs May said MPs would now be given until October to examine the plans.

Three Commons select committees will now report on the issues before the Government starts negotiations with the EU this autumn.

Tory Eurosceptic Peter Bone, welcomed the climbdown but said it did not go far enough.

‘We need assurances that we are not going to be bounced into accepting this. We also want a vote on every one of these measures before we opt back in,’ he said.

Ministers remain on stand-by for a vote on Monday. That is because of fears the Government could lose if a cross-party consensus forms around calls for even greater scrutiny than Mrs May has now offered.

The Arrest Warrant has been criticised after a string of cases in which British citizens have been extradited and held on remand to stand trial on minor charges.

But senior police officers pushed ministers to stay in the system, arguing that it helps them apprehend suspects who flee to other parts of the EU.
