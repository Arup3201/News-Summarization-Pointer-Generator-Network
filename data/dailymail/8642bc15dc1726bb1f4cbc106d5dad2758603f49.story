Murdered: Chris Preece was stabbed to death on his farmstead by robbers who took mobile phones

A British engineer was murdered and his wife brutally beaten at their remote South African farm by robbers who took just £210 cash and a mobile phone.

Chris Preece, 54, who made his home there after ‘falling in love with the country’ was hacked to death in his kitchen by a gang with machetes.

His wife Felicity, 56, was stabbed and hit with a pole, fracturing her skull.

She survived a 12-hour wait for help by treating her own wounds.

The murder, on Saturday evening, is the latest in a spate of violent robberies in South Africa targeting relatively wealthy white farmers.

Mr Preece, originally from Southgate, north London, was attacked at about 7pm as he went to take his seven dogs for a walk at his farm near Ficksburg, on the Lesotho border.

The gang killed him, then attacked his wife.

‘Because the gang had cut the telephone wires and there is no mobile phone reception, she couldn’t get help,’ said friend and neighbour Gavin Hoole.

‘It was only the next morning, at around 7am, that anyone realised something was wrong.’

Mr Preece’s South African daughter-in-law Jeanne Preece said he had gone to the country in 1995 to work as a geotechnical engineer with diamond firm De Beers.

‘He fell in love with South Africa from day one,’ she said yesterday.

Last year he was made principal geotechnical engineer for rival mining firm Snowden in

Johannesburg.

He would drive 200 miles home to his wife every weekend.

The couple kept horses and were in the process of transforming the farm into a nature reserve with cheetahs and birds of prey.

Jeanne Preece, who is married to their son, said the couple, who have two daughters, were unaware there had been a murder and four robberies on local farms in the past month.

Felicity Preece was yesterday said to be in a ‘stable but traumatised state’ in hospital.

Mr Preece's death is the latest in an alarming trend of brutal murders on remote farmsteads in post apartheid South Africa.

Since
 the country's first fully democratic elections in 1994, more than 3,000
 white, mainly Afrikaans, farmers have been killed in their homes.

The so-called 'farm attacks' are part of the wave of criminality that has engulfed the country in recent years, something criminologist blame of a number of factors, including inept policing and widening social inequality.

But in the case of 'farm attacks' - which occur far from the crime-ravaged townships - academics also blame a breakdown in the traditional social contract between employer and employee.

Police research shows that the murders are normally carried out by drug-addicted, unemployed black men. Often they have some connection with the targeted farmstead.

Local police said the attack at Mr Preece's farm - called Fleur de Lys - is the fifth such attack, and the second murder, in the district over the past month.

Yesterday Jeanne Preece told the local Volksblad newspaper how Mr Preece had moved to South Africa in 1995 for work, after which he had 'fallen in love' with the country.

He worked as principal geotechnical engineer for mining firm Snowden and was based in the country's commercial capital Johannesburg.

However he spent every weekend on the farm, 200 miles drive away, where he wife Felicity lived.

The couple were passionate about wildlife and welcomed local children to the farm to teach them to ride horses.

It had been the couple's dream to turn the farm, which is set in rolling green hills, into a nature reserve and rehabilitation resort for owls and cheetahs.

He was especially looking forward to seeing all his family over Christmas, Mrs Preece said.

Yesterday a spokesman for the hospital at which Mrs Preece is being treated said she is in a 'stable but traumatized state'.

Local police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said police were alerted to the attack by a worker who discovered the bloody scene as he arrived for work on Sunday morning.

He said the murder weapons were found in the house. Police have not yet arrested anyone in connection with the attack, which locals believe to have been committed by men who crossed the nearby border from Lesotho.
