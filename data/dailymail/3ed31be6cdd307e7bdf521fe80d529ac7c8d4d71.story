Aaron Ramsey has dedicated his opening goal in Wales' impressive 3-0 win over Israel to the memory of his grandmother, who died recently.

The Arsenal midfielder opened the scoring in Haifa just before half-time as the Welsh moved top of European Championship qualifying Group B ahead of Belgium, Israel and Bosnia and Herzegovina who are all ranked above them.

And Ramsey used his post-match comments to pay tribute to his grandmother after he ended what he described as a 'tough week' on a huge high.

The 24-year-old pointed to the sky during his celebrations, and he has now clarified that the gesture was in memory of his nan.

'My nan passed away on the weekend, that's why it's been quite tough,' Ramsey said.

'My goal was for her. I'm just really proud I could score the goal for her. I know she's looking down on me and I was glad I could score.

'I shut my eyes, got my head on it and thankfully it went in. It was a great performance and Ginge (James Collins) said in the dressing room that's maybe the best performance away from home he has been involved in.

'We looked quite comfortable and played with a lot of belief. It was a great performance from the boys, we came here believing we could get a result and we managed to do it.'

Gareth Bale added two further goals for Wales, who now look to have a great chance of qualifying for Euro 2016 in France next summer.
