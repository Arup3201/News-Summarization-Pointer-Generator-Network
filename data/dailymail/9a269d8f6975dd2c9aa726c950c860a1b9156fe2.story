Ed Miliband's most senior adviser, Lord Stewart Wood, says a future Labour government should swing sharply to the Left

Ed Miliband’s most senior adviser says a future Labour government should swing sharply to the Left, overturning many of the economic reforms brought in by Margaret Thatcher.

In a hard-hitting speech to a conference sponsored by the Unite trade union, Lord Stewart Wood launched a fierce attack on privatisation, the cutting of business regulation, tax cuts for higher earners and the Coalition’s austerity programme.

He called for a ‘high-wage, high-skills’ economy and worker representation on company boards.

Lord Wood strongly hinted that a Labour government would return to tax, borrow and spend policies, rejecting the charge that record high public spending and borrowing under the previous government had been in any way responsible for the crash.

‘The Conservatives are wrong about so many things,’ he said. ‘They are wrong about the nature of the crisis in 2008. Their view was that it was a crisis of overspending. This is simply untrue.’

Lord Wood, who is in the shadow cabinet and advises Mr Miliband on strategy, said the next Labour government would usher in a new economic settlement.

‘What is the settlement I have in mind? A supply-side revolution,’ he said. ‘Like the idea of the Thatcher years but a Left supply-side revolution is what we need.’

He said that Tory liberal economic policies would not keep Britain out of recession in the long term.

‘They are as wrong about that as they were about the policies of the 1980s and the origins of the crash,’ he said.

In his speech to the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), a new trade union think-tank, he admitted that the previous government had presided over a full-scale ‘depression’ rather than a recession.

‘I mean what looks like a depression in retrospect on government revenues and the increase in government spending,’ he said.

Lord Wood, who served as an economic adviser to Gordon Brown before being ennobled by Mr Miliband, also conceded that ‘inequality rocketed to shameful levels’ under Labour and then effectively condemned his party’s record on education. He said that ‘poor people are leaving school without any kind of skills’.

In a further admission, he said Labour had not done enough to create jobs. ‘We need to renew our focus on work. We went silent on work for too long over the past 20 years,’ he said.

He said that getting people into work should be a cornerstone of policy on the welfare state but it was ‘also about pay’.

‘We have to look at strengthening the minimum wage, supporting the Living Wage, and finding ways to promote that,’ he said.

Lord Wood’s speech was given a rapturous reception. Steve Hart, a former political director of Unite, said it signalled the biggest change in Labour thinking since the 1945 Atlee government introduced the welfare state.

The peer’s refusal to concede that the previous Labour government spent and borrowed too much is echoed by Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor. Yet only last week even Tony Blair admitted that Labour should have started cutting spending as early as 2005.

Lord Wood, a politics tutor at Magdalene College, Oxford, was the keynote speaker at the first conference of Class, which was set up last year by the unions.

The think-tank is based at the London headquarters of Unite, which is Labour’s most generous benefactor, having given almost £9million since the election. The union is at the centre of the row over vote rigging in Falkirk.

Len McCluskey, its militant general secretary, told the conference of 500 delegates they had nothing to be ashamed of after the Daily Mail’s revelations about the union’s bullying leverage tactics.‘Ugly trade unionism is effective trade unionism,’ he said.

Tory MP Damian Hinds described Lord Wood’s comments as ‘a nightmare vision of Labour’s secret plans’.

‘Labour still want more spending, more borrowing and more debt – exactly what got us into a mess in the first place,’ he said. ‘It shows hard-pressed people would be crushed by higher taxes if Labour win in 2015.’
