An Australian Special Forces soldier pulled a gun on an Australian spy during an alcohol-fuelled encounter last year, an intelligence report confirms.

The soldier, from Australia’s Defence support team, reportedly drew a loaded gun on a spy from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) during a drinking session in Afghanistan, according to ABC reports.  

The soldier is understood to have been a part of the Special Air Service (SAS) regiment, who are assigned to protect ASIS agents at risk during highly classified and dangerous missions.

According to agency policy, an ASIS agent with a blood alcohol content above zero must not be issued with or have carriage of a weapon.

A review of the incident found ASIS had failed to put ‘adequate controls in place’ to stop an intoxicated agent from accessing a gun. 

'While no physical injury resulted, the incident had the potential to cause serious injury,' Dr Vivienne Thoms wrote in her annual report.

'ASIS’s investigation of the incident highlighted systemic issues,'

Dr Thoms is by Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and exposed the incident in her recently published annual report. 

Dr Thom had concluded a six month inquiry into the use of weapons by ASIS a month before the altercation occurred.

Following the incident, Dr Thom was informed that there had been inaccuracies in the information provided to her about ASIS for her weapons inquiry.

ASIS was banned from carrying arms until 2003, after a serious incident in 1983, where submachine guns were used by trainee spies to threaten staff at the Sheraton Hotel

In June 2014, Ms Thom launched a further investigation into ASIS’ management of weapons.

ASIS was banned from carrying arms until 2003, after a serious incident in 1983, where submachine guns were used by trainee spies to threaten staff at the Sheraton Hotel.

The Hawke government barred the agency from having weapons.

The agency is highly secretive, but Inspector General Dr Thom is responsible for adhere to the law.
