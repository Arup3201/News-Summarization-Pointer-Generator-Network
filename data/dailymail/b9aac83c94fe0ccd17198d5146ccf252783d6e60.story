Teachers will be allowed to use force on pupils again after after new figures revealed the extent of violent behaviour in our classrooms.

Ministers lifted the 'no touching' ban to ‘unequivocally restore adult authority to the classroom’.

Almost 1,000 pupils – some as young as five – are excluded for abuse or assault every school day.

Assault: Figures show that 44 teachers were taken to hospital after being attacked at school last year

Serious attacks on staff have increased, with 44 teachers taken to hospital last year.

The new measures, to be introduced in September, state all schools should scrap existing ‘no touch’ policies.

At present, teachers are not allowed to touch a child in the course of teaching them a musical instrument or helping them in an accident.

But teachers will now be able to use reasonable force to eject unruly pupils from the classroom, or prevent them from leaving.

The measures will allow teaches to stand between pupils or physically block their path. Staff will be able to guide children by the arm or restrain youngsters to get them under control.

Teachers may get involved to break up fights or prevent disruptive pupils from attacking other classmates or teachers.

The figures, from an official Government report, lay bare the full extent of the mayhem in our classrooms.

Astonishingly, one in four teaching staff has been the subject of a false allegation by pupils.

These range from sexual abuse to verbal assault.

One in six has had a false allegation made against them by a member of a pupil’s family.

The worrying trends have led 
two-thirds of teachers to consider leaving the profession, according to 
the Department for Education. 

Former deputy head Katharine 
Birbalsingh – dismissed after criticising behaviour in state schools at 
last year’s Tory conference – said violence was prominent because the 
school system was 'broken'.

She said: 'Pushing and shoving and 
worse forms of violence are a huge problem. The problem is the endemic 
culture of blame in schools – bad behaviour is also attributed to bad 
teaching.

'Management push this theory, children use it as an excuse, 
and teachers themselves begin to believe it.

'You
have a situation where struggling teachers will not seek help for fear 
of looking incompetent. And meanwhile children are left to think that 
they can get away with anything and push the boundaries.'

A recent series of attacks – ranging from stabbing to rape – support the report’s findings that violent behaviour is prominent in the classroom.

Experts have blamed soft parenting and teaching for creating a generation unable to respect authority or interact socially without lashing out.

They fear parents struggling to juggle the pressures of modern life are unable to spend quality time with their children. Instead many are left unsupervised in front of a TV or computer.

Nick Seaton of the Campaign for Real Education said: 'Adults fail to teach discipline and a respect for authority.

'At a tender age children are told 
they are the centre of the universe and it makes them too self-centred 
and totally uncontrollable.'

There were almost 1,000 exclusions 
every day in England’s schools last year.

In addition, one in four children have been bullied at school and one in five have been a victim of bullying outside school.

Charlie Taylor, the Coalition’s 
'behaviour tsar', said: 'Behaviour is good at most schools, but these 
figures demonstrate concerning levels of violence in a small number.

'This
kind of behaviour is a serious disruption to teaching and learning. It 
is a major factor in deterring good people from becoming teachers and is
a common reason for experienced teachers to leave the profession.'

The Department for Education today publishes guidance for teachers on how to deal with bad behaviour.

Ministers want to 'unequivocally restore adult authority to the classroom'.

They have axed Labour’s 600 page guidance – which they claim confused teachers – and have replaced it with just 52 pages.

The new measures, to be introduced in September, say all schools should scrap existing 'no touch' policies.

At present, teachers are not allowed to touch a child in the course of teaching them a musical instrument or helping them in an accident.

Teachers will also be able to use reasonable force to eject unruly pupils. And heads will be able to search without consent for an extended list of banned items such as alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen property.

Ministers will also place an onus on schools to crack down on bullying. In addition, pupils who make false allegations will face suspension, expulsion, or criminal prosecution.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: 'This new, clear and concise guidance removes the red tape that has stopped teachers from being confident in maintaining discipline in the classroom.'

Disciplinarian Sir Michael Wilshaw, who turned the worst school in England into one of best, has been tipped for the post of chief inspector of schools.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has approached the headmaster of Mossbourne Academy, in London, to persuade him to accept the vacant £180,000 post at Ofsted.

Sir Michael takes an uncompromising view towards substandard behaviour. He imposes strict penalties on pupils who do not do their homework and has a zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour.

A previous version of this  article reported that 1,000 pupils a day are excluded for violent behaviour and that this has doubled in a year. While the figure for exclusions is correct – and all the statistics were put to the Department before publication – this does not in fact represent an increase.
