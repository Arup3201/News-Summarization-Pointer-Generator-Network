Seattle's new professional women's soccer team has lost one of its star players after she accidentally fell pregnant.

Reign Football Club confirmed today that two-time Olympic gold-medalist Amy Rodriguez is expecting and will miss the 2013 inaugural National Women's Soccer League season.

The team's head coach Laura Harvey revealed the 25-year-old's pregnancy wasn't planned in a statement on the team's Facebook page.

'Amy's pregnancy came as quite a 
surprise and has introduced some challenges that we are now beginning to
work through,' Harvey wrote on Facebook.

The soccer team will also start the season without Megan Rapinoe and Teresa Noyola, who are playing in Europe. But Harvey said they are looking for players without contracts who they can sign in the meantime.

'We expect a huge boost mid-season 
when Rapinoe and Noyola join the club, but in the meantime we will 
address the gaps created by the absences of Rodriguez, Rapinoe and 
Noyola through free signings and the supplemental draft next week.'

Rodriguez - known as A-Rod to her teammates - is a forward for The Reign and
is also a member of the United States' National Women's Soccer team.

She played for the nation and won gold in both the Beijing Olympics in 
2008 and last year's London Olympics.

The Reign will begin play this season
in the new eight-team National Women's Soccer League that will receive 
support from the United States Soccer Federation, the Canadian Soccer 
Association and the Mexican Football Federation.

Challenges: Harvey said A-Rod's pregnancy posed challenges for the team

Reign FC owner Bill Predmore congratulated Rodriguez and her husband Adam Shilling on the pregnancy.

Shilling is a goalie for the University of Southern California men's water polo team. The pair met as students at USC and married in 2011.

'We congratulate Amy and her husband on this wonderful news,' Predmore said.

'We let her know that we are here to support her in any way we can and that we look forward to having her join our club in 2014. Please join us in wishing Amy and her family all the best!'

Earlier this month 55 players -- 23 from the United States, 16 Canadians and 16 Mexicans -- were allocated to eight clubs in the new National Women's Soccer League.

Rodriguez was one the stars of the 23 Americans.

The allocation of players was an early step in building the league and US Soccer is subsidizing the salaries of the 23 US players.
