West Ham winger Matt Jarvis has his sights set on making up for lost time with an extended run in the first team.

The Irons laboured through a 1-1 draw against West Brom on Thursday, after two gruelling Barclays Premier League fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal.

Manager Sam Allardyce's squad will welcome extra recovery time from the hectic Christmas schedule as their FA Cup third-round tie at Everton will not be played until Tuesday night.

Jarvis came off the bench against the Baggies, who were watched at Upton Park by new manager Tony Pulis, and offered some threat down the flanks.

With Senegal duo Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho set to head to the Africa Cup of Nations, former Wolves midfielder Jarvis is hoping to make the most of any more opportunities having spent a spell out earlier in the season following a thigh injury.

'It has been very frustrating for me, but when you get a chance to play, you have to do well and hopefully I have done that,' said Jarvis, who has made just four appearances since October.

'I was extremely disappointed to get injured before the start of the season, that has cost me, but now I am back to being fully fit and trying to get back into the team.' 

After taking just one point from three matches, West Ham stand in seventh place, yet still within striking distance of the top four.

Jarvis said: 'The two games before were very hard fixtures and it would have been for any team.

'We were disappointed not to have taken all three points against West Brom, but it is another point and we keep going.'

Sakho, who headed West Ham into an early lead before Saido Berahino equalised for West Brom, is set for a scan on his back after being substituted during the second half.

However he would have been unavailable for the Everton match anyway under FIFA regulations for international release.

Allardyce admits the scheduling of the cup fixture came as something of a surprise.

He said: 'It is a big FA Cup third-round tie on a Tuesday night, which is a bit bizarre and something I don't think I have done before.

'But it gives the lads time to rest and recover and make sure we can put a team out to try to get through to the next round.'
