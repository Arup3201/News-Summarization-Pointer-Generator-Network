France's first lady said last night she regretted humiliating the mother of the president’s four children.

Valerie Trierweiler had tweeted support for a politician standing against Segolene Royal, 58, in parliamentary elections.

A presidential aide said Miss Trierweiler, 47 – nicknamed the Rottweiler – had since been told to ‘stay in the shadows’ because president Francois Hollande was ‘furious’ at her intervention.

Mr Hollande, who lived with Miss 
Royal for 30 years, wanted to make her the speaker of the National 
Assembly but backed down when she lost the election.

A friend of Miss Trierweiler said she admitted: ‘I made a mistake.’ The friend added: ‘She did not calculate the consequences.’

Ms Trierweiler, who has been divorced
twice, has three sons of her own and said that the only reason she had 
not travelled to Mexico with Hollande for the G8 meeting was because 
they have exams this week.

Intriguingly, Ms Trierweiler's 
personal biography has disappeared from the Elysee Palace website, but 
another aide insisted that it was 'being edited' and would return.

Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter to announce her support for socialist Olivier Falorni

But the same aide confirmed that Ms 
Trierweiler was being encouraged to 'remain in the shadows'  because Ms 
Hollande was 'furious' at the way she has behaved so far.

Referring to the tweet, he said 'clearly this cannot happen again'.

Despite the continuing saga which has
reduced the Elysee to a soap opera, journalist Ms Trierweiler's arts 
column is set to appear in Paris Match magazine this week.

And she has insisted she will not give up her Twitter account.

Mr Hollande has now refused to give Ms Royal a job because she lost the La Rochelle seat in western France so heavily.

But, despite consistent defeats since
being rejected for the presidency in 2007, Ms Royal insists that she 
can revive her political career.

She has, meanwhile, told friends of her own that Ms Trierweiler is a 'traitor' who treated her disgracefully.
