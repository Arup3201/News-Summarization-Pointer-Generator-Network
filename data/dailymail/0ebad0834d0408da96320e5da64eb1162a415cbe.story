A motorcyclist involved in an accident shocked doctors when his heart rotated in his chest.

The 48-year-old Italian man was rushed to a hospital’s emergency department after being 
involved in the crash.

Upon his arrival, doctors tried to listen to his heart.

Doctors in Italy were amazed when a motorbike crash caused a man's heart to rotate 90 degrees to the right. X-ray (left) shows the heart after it had rotated and (right) shows it back in its normal position 24 hours later

It was then they discovered it was in an unusual place, Live Science reports.

They X-rayed the man’s chest and carried out a CT scan which revealed that his heart had rotated 90 degrees to the right and was sitting on the right side of his chest.

They also noted his aorta and pulmonary artery had rotated to the right.

The man had also suffered numerous broken ribs, a collapsed lung, bruising to both lungs and a ruptured spleen, according to a report on the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.

However, despite this, he was conscious and the only signs of his heart problems were a slight drop in his blood pressure and a slight increase in his heart rate.

Dr Gregory
 Fontana, chairman of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at Lenox 
Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in this patient’s 
case, explained his theory to Live Science.

He believes the heart turned in the minutes after the crash.

He said it is extremely unusual and even
 more surprising that the patient was alert and conscious - despite such
 a significant injury.

He suggested damage to the motorcyclist’s lungs may have meant that air seeped into his chest cavity.

If air had built up in his chest, this could have forced the heart to turn to the right.

Amazingly, the man survived the horrific injury and his heart returned to its normal position the next day, report doctors from the University of Padua, Italy.

Once the air was removed for the patient’s chest, his heart returned to its normal position.

Amazingly, further tests showed the man's heart had suffered no lasting damage – none of the blood vessels had torn and the valves were functioning normally.

The patient did, however, have to have emergency surgery to remove his spleen.

The Italian patient is not the first to have a bizarre heart condition reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Last year, the journal reported the case
 of a woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her heart 
started pulsating violently.

Last year the New England Journal of Medicine ran a report on the case of a Canadian woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her neck (pictured) started to pulsate violently

The 33-year-old Canadian woman’s abnormal pulse alerted doctors to the fact she had a condition caused by a faulty heart valve.

She was diagnosed with the heart condition tricuspid regurgitation.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart's tricuspid valve does not close properly, meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts.

The valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber.

When it is faulty the pressure in the blood vessels can change.

This can lead to the abnormal pulses seen in the Canadian patient’s neck.

They think air leaked from his damaged lungs and forced it to turn
