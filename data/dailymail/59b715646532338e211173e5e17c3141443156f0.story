A mother embezzled more than $10million from the car dealership where she worked and spent it over six years on luxury trips, extravagant presents and once-in-a-lifetime experiences.

Patricia Smith splashed millions of dollars on VIP tickets to see the Pope, a costume fitting and cameo performance in The Phantom of The Opera and a gourmet lunch cooked and hosted by celebrity chef Ina 'The Barefoot Contessa' Garten at her Hamptons home.

The 58-year-old, who worked at the Pittsburg Baierl Acura car dealership in Pennsylvania, was jailed for six-and-a-half years on Wednesday.

The elaborate theft drew similarities with the Coen brothers' film Fargo -  where a car dealership employee fakes a kidnapping in an attempt to extort millions - except Smith's crimes were solely white collar.

Convicted: Patricia Smith, 58, stole $10million over the course of six years, and now she faces that same amount of time behind bars after being found guilty of wire fraud

Smith worked as a controller at the Acura dealership and fudged business records and made illegal bank transfers that amounted to over $10million extra dollars in her bank account.

When broken down over time, AOL Autos reports that equates to her pocketing $4,000 every day during her six-year-crime spree.

In court, Smith was extremely apologetic and sobbed to the judge after being charged with wire fraud. The district attorney reported that Smith made over 800 deposits from the company's accounts into her own accounts since 2004.

Local station WTAE said that she cited an incurable need for approval by her family and friends as the reason for embezzling. 

Smith said that she felt like a 'horrible daughter, wife, mother and friend' and used the gifts and trips to 'earn their love'.

Her lawyer put it another way, saying that she had an abusive childhood that lead to a gambling addiction and propensity to overspend.

For the love: Smith said that she spent the millions on gifts for her family to 'earn their love', like she did when she got four luxury tickets to the 2011 Super Bowl

A holy visit: She bought private tours of The Vatican (left) and Sistine Chapel, along with VIP seats at a Mass attended by the Pope (like the one on the right)

She 'wanted to see what happiness looked like' and she appeared to have a varied interpretation of the good life.

She spent $1.8million on private jets to seven different European countries and four Caribbean islands along with hour homes in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, the beach town of Avalon, and a residence in Columbus, Georgia.

When she wasn't busy traveling abroad or resting in her homes, Smith treated herself and her friends to unique experiences.

She spent $44,500 on four well-placed tickets to the Super Bowl in 2011 and $32,500 for a six-person lunch cooked by Food Network star Ina Garten in the home where she hosts her television show.

Serious spending: Smith bought a first-edition Harry Potter book (like the one on the left) and paid $32,500 for TV chef Ina Garten (right) to cook a luncheon for she and five friends at Garten's East Hampton home

Perhaps feeling as if she needed to repent for some of her illegal activity, Smith paid $5,000 for 'The Vatican Package' which featured plane tickets for four to Rome, a private tour of the Vatican and Sistine Chapel as well as seats to a Mass in the Papal audience.

Another bizarre purchase was the $2,500 she spent to have a costume and wig fitting at The Phantom of The Opera play along with the chance to make an appearance on stage during the Hannibal Opera sequence while four of her friends watched on in the audience.

Smith wasn’t above accumulating physical possessions either, buying a first-edition Harry Potter book, a baby grand piano, flat screen televisions, SUVs and a Mustang convertible.

Left in the lurch: The Baierl Acura car dealership will only receive about $1million back from the $10million that she stole during her tenure as their controller

The district attorney said that Smith was apologetic and thanked them for the compassion that both they and the Marshall's office showed during the investigation.

Along with the next six years that Smith will spend behind bars, the dealership also lost out because of the embezzlement: they will only be reimbursed for about $1million of the $10million that she took.

'We're glad that justice has been served and this matter is now behind us,' the management team said in a statement.

'Our business is doing well and we have adopted stronger measures to prevent such a crime from ever happening again.'
