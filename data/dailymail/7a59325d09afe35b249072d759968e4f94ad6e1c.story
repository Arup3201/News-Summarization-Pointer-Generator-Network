Car service costs can range from a modest £60 to an eye-watering £360, a report reveals today.

The research by consumer watchdog Which? was based on the cost of an annual service for a Ford Focus.

‘Depending on where you live, and whether you opt to have your car serviced at a franchised dealer or an independent garage, the variations in cost can be enormous,’ a Which? spokesman said.

The research also showed that by shopping around, car owners could save as much as £230.

The lowest price was £60 in Southend. The most expensive quote was £360 in Luton and Reading.

The lowest five places for average quotes were Belfast £123, Sunderland £129, Liverpool £132, Southend £134 and Bolton £136.

The highest were Preston £196, Aberdeen £200, Central London £207, Luton £214 and Reading £227.

Which? says that while there are differences between individual makes and  models of car in terms of what needs to be covered in each service, there are some general rules of thumb.

They also added it’s important to understand the difference between a minor service and a major one.
