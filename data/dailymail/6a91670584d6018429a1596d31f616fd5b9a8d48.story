Andy Murray's great day at the office had a special ending when he met comedy hero Ricky Gervais.

The defending Wimbledon champion has been hugely impressive during the first week of the Championships and raced into the fourth round with a 6-2 6-3 6-2 victory over 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.

Murray dropped his serve for the first time in the tournament, once in the second set and once in the third, but both were minor blips when he was already fully in control.

He will now have two days to prepare for a fourth-round meeting with 6ft 8in 20th seed Kevin Anderson on Monday.

Gervais watched the match from Murray's player box and then joined the Wimbledon champion for his warm-down.

'I got to chat with him afterwards,' said Murray. 'I'd never met him before. I'm a huge fan of The Office.

'I've watched a lot of the stuff that he's done, but when I went over to Spain when I was 15, I watched an episode of The Office almost every single night I was there.

'I could basically remember it word for word when I was over there training. It was nice for me to get to meet him after the match.'
