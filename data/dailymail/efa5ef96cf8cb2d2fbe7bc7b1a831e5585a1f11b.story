A sacred tree which came back to life after it was nearly destroyed by vandals must now be replaced - thanks to trophy hunters who have broken off its new shoots.

The Holy Thorn Tree in Glastonbury Somerset - which can trace its roots back 2,000 years to the death of Jesus - had its branches hacked off in December last year.

It miraculously started to grow new shoots earlier this year and made a fragile recovery over the summer.

Hacked off: The Holy Thorn in Glastonbury, Somerset. The sacred tree's fragile recovery from an attack by vandals has been put at risk by trophy hunters

But some of the new growth has now been removed and locals suspect trophy hunters will use them to try and grow their own holy tree.

The tree was also damaged by ribbons tied around the trunk and coins and other items that have been shoved into the bark.

Well-wishers have even poured honey, Guinness and cider around the roots, causing further damage.

Local councillor John Coles, a former Mayor of Glastonbury, said it will be replaced with a new one grafted from the original branches which were hacked off.

'People don't realise the damage they are doing. I am forever removing these ribbons because they block sunlight to the trunk,' he said.

'We've had people pulling things off - the new growth and bark on the trunk. We think it would have survived if it was just left alone.

'There is still life in the trunk but we doubt that it will ever recover. It is very sad but we think the best thing is to replace it.'

The new tree has been grafted by experts at Kew Gardens and is likely to be planted nearby to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year.

It could be monitored by a CCTV camera to prevent a repeat of the damage caused to the current tree, Mr Coles added.

Experts have verified that the felled tree - known as the Crategus Monogyna Bi Flora - originated from the Middle East.

Christian legend dictates that Jesus's great uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, came to Britain after the crucifixion 2,000 years ago bearing the Holy Grail - the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper.

He visited Glastonbury and thrust his staff into Wearyall Hill, just below the Tor, planting a seed for the original thorn tree.

Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads felled the tree during the English Civil War, when Parliament waged a vicious battle against the Crown.

However, locals salvaged the roots of the original tree, hiding it in secret locations around Glastonbury.

It was then replanted on the hill in 1951. Other cuttings were also grown and placed around the town - including its famous Glastonbury Abbey.
