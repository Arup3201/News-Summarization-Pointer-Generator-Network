Every Saturday night, we can expect the same, soggy X Factor weather forecast. A hurricane of hurt, closely followed by a tear-nado ripping across Cheryl’s carefully applied make-up, causing widespread disruption of her mascara.

Yes, there will be the occasional showers in the vicinity of Mel B. Sometimes even Louis looks a bit damp near coastal areas — and Simon certainly seems slightly overcast when he reads the latest viewing figures.

Yet the full-scale flooding alert remains in place only over Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, with further tears expected to fall on already saturated ground and the prospect of even more to come at the judges’ houses stage this weekend.

Episode 10: As Andrea Faustini warbles away, Chezza weeps so much you've got to wonder if her false eyelashes are welded on with a new strain of water-resistant superglue

What is wrong with Cheryl, who has been sobbing since the very first episode? She cries when contestants are good, she cries when they are bad, she cries whenever she feels like it, which appears to be most of the time.

For the returning Geordie judge, much of this series of the Blub Factor has been a three-hankie weepie, a two-tissue sobfest, a one-woman show of emotion in a never-ending ugly bug bawl.

It is understandable if the poor contestants, especially the rejects, burst into tears while holding their head in their hands, moaning softly. But why-oh-why, particularly given how much she gets paid, should Cheryl be so distraught? Yet since the first episode of this series, the newly-married 31-year-old has been weeping like an open wound.

By now, we all know the warning signs that signal a Cheryl sob storm is imminent. The wobbly lip and chin. The promise to some poor, warbling misfit that they are ‘just my cuppa tea’. That photogenic, misty look into the middle distance.

Episode three: Monica Michael sings a syrupy self-penned tribute to her little sister, reminding Cheryl that she also has a sister and (right) Cheryl reaches for the tissues during Jake Quickenden's performance during episode four

And then the brimming eyes as Cheryl realises that the auditionee reminds Cheryl of a younger Cheryl; of a time when Cheryl herself was a struggling Cheryl and not the millionaire-popstar, professional-mime-artiste and flogger-of-hairspray-and-perfumes Cheryl that she is today. Blub!

She’s like sequined semtex. Anything can set her off.

In the very first episode, Cheryl was weeping as she hugged a contestant she had briefly met years ago. This seemed an unlikely wellspring of emotion, but never mind.

A silvery teardrop trickled down her face, like a rivulet of ice melt inching down a beige glacier. At her side, Mel B went to pieces during an audition by Jay James, expertly flicking away her tears with windscreen wiper fingers.

A week later, Cheryl is squeezing out some salty ones over Monica Michael’s performance. Why? Because Monica sang a song she had written about her sister — and this reminds our Chez of her own little sister, who apparently writes her poems, too.

Episode five: Comeback queen and Essex girl Amy Connelly gets Cheryl's vote, but no one else is impressed

Episode nine: Time to pick who goes through to the judges' house round and the pressure is on

This time it’s double bubble: twin tracks from both eyes as our girl manages to somehow look stricken yet devout, like a nun who realises she has forgotten to wear her underpinnings to mass. Look at St Cheryl of the Snivellers, Our Lady of Sobs! Oh, it’s all getting too much.

In episode five, she is welling up again as Amy Connelly sings the Whitney Houston classic, The Greatest Love Of All. What’s heated her gravy up this time? Perhaps someone has just told her that Bambi’s mother really did die, and she’s struggling to cope with that news in a very flattering, soft focus kind of way.

Last weekend, the return of Monica Michael threw Cheryl into yet another tizzy. In this episode, she puts her hands over her damp eyes so often, cynics wonder if she’s just using her emotion as an excuse to flash her ginormous engagement ring. Stranger things have happened at sea.

Speaking of which, the following night, Cheryl hoists the howling mainsail and climbs aboard the good ship Soggy Kleenex on her biggest voyage of tears to date.

What on earth has happened now? Has somebody died? Even worse, has Simon cut her Christmas bonus? No. A young man from Italy called Andrea Faustini is wearing tragically turned-up jeans, bearing his patterned socks to the world. That’s enough to do it. Screaming blubs!!

He is also singing rather nicely, which is what one would hope for in a singing contest, but somehow, this tips Cheryl into full diamond-ring-flashing, wrist-buckling meltdown, with Mel B joining in on sobby backing vocals.

Later, in the arena auditions, a singer called Helen Fulthorpe makes Mel B have a deep weep, while an unusually dry-eyed Cheryl jokes to the bewildered singer that she ‘made Scary Spice cry’.

Hark at her. People cry for different reasons. We cry because we feel sad and bad, we cry for all the suffering in the world, we cry because sometimes it’s the only human response that seems appropriate. Cheryl’s showbiz tears only serve to dilute real emotion and if she is like this with this Niagara of nobodies, what is she going to be like during the live finals?

Meanwhile, the terrible news is that she has forecast stormy squalls of tears tonight. In the past, Cheryl has said the judges’ houses stage, where she personally has to tell her hand-picked contestants that their X Factor journey is over and send them home, is the most emotionally wrenching of all. For her, not them. Hankies aloft, you have been warned.
