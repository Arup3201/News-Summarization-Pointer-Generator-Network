Louis van Gaal has admitted his players are having problems coping with his methods at Manchester United as it emerged that a one-hour inquest was held the day after the dismal 5-3 defeat at Leicester last Sunday.

Striker Robin van Persie said ‘confronting’ views were exchanged during the meeting but feels this was beneficial to the squad as United look for a win against West Ham on Saturday to stop their  Premier League campaign veering completely off track.

Van Persie  is still puzzled by United’s failure to beat Leicester after leading 3-1.

Louis van Gaal could barely watch as his side capitulated 5-3 against Leicester City last weekend 

The defeat prompted the Dutchman to accept that some of his players have not adapted to his methods

Robin van Persie, who scored United's first goal at Leicester, said Van Gaal held a post-match summit meeting

‘It shouldn’t be possible, but it still happened,’ Van Persie told Fox Sports. ‘So we had a proper look at it the next day.

‘Sometimes it was a bit confronting. It was a really good meeting as everyone spoke up and shared their feelings.

‘It was a long meeting — one hour or something — but we went from there, started again this week, put a couple of really good sessions in and everyone feels ready to face West Ham.’

Missing 10 players through injury or suspension on Saturday, United will have an unusual look about them as manager Van Gaal admits his team have not yet fully adapted to him.

‘We give a lot of information and you have to work out that information,’ he said.

‘There shall be a moment in the season when this information is too much, maybe at this moment it is too much for the players.’

Van Gaal is considering his options for the West Ham match as he looks to cope with the absence of injured defenders Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, as well as the banned Tyler Blackett.

Admitting that he was aware of the injury history of Evans, Jones and Smalling, Van Gaal believes he can solve the problem.

‘I have been told (about their injury records) and now they are confirming that,’ he said. ‘But I have good hopes that we shall improve in that matter because normally I don’t have any injuries.

‘As a good example, for a player who was many times injured — Arjen Robben — in my season at Bayern Munich he was never injured.

‘You do that by training sessions that adapt to the players’ level. It was not only Robben but every player at Munich.

Chris Smalling is one of many Manchester United players to have under-performed since Van Gaal took over

Wayne Rooney, Tyler Blackett and Daley Blind were  among those who struggled at the King Power Stadium

‘We are doing that here in the same way, only less than I have done with Bayern Munich. We have to improve the level and intensity so the players can play the games.’

Questions have been asked about why Van Gaal did not buy world-class defenders during the club’s big-money summer spending spree. 

At Leicester, a Van Gaal team conceded five for what the Dutch coach feels is the first time in his career.

However, the 63-year-old insisted he did try to sign a big-name central defender.

Van Gaal defended his way of operating and expects his side to bounce back against West Ham on Saturday

Referring to failed attempts to recruit Mats Hummels from Dortmund and Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal, Van Gaal said: ‘Maybe we were in the market already in August for the right central defender.

‘You never know. But I don’t want to discuss that with you. I do understand (the criticism) because I as a manager have never conceded five goals. Never.

‘Maybe once, but I cannot remember. As a player, yes, more than five against, but I was not a very good player — a top player — so I played in regular clubs.

‘But as a manager I never conceded five.’
