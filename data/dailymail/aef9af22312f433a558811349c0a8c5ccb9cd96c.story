The new watchdog regulating the Press will come ‘armed with a slim, clear book of rules and not with an iron fist’ when it tackles complaints, its chairman has said.

Sir Alan Moses, who leads the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), warned editors he will ‘damn’ those that flagrantly break the rules.

In a speech to the Society of Editors, Sir Alan said: ‘Mistakes and errors of judgment will always occur.

‘But if you do so deliberately, flagrantly, without caring one jot whether you break the code or not, Ipso will damn you.’

Sir Alan insisted he does not want to see a ‘boring’ British Press and told how he wants Ipso to support newspapers in continuing to be ‘unruly’.

‘We do not want a boring, defensive Press: we want a free, fair and unruly Press ruled only by an independent regulator, Ipso, who will support you and encourage you to remain free, fair and unruly,’ Sir Alan said.

The vast majority of newspapers have signed up to Ipso, which replaces the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), with The Guardian and Financial Times among notable absentees.
