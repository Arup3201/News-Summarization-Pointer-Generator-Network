A man stabbed eight people, including three children, to death when a row over feng shui got out of hand.

Armed police swooped on the villange of Beidian, in Henan province, China, after Li Hsing butchered neighbours from two families because one pointed a mirror at his home.

Feng shui is an ancient Chinese esoteric philosophy that aims to harmonise human existence with the surrounding environment by orienting dwellings in an auspicious way.

Villagers gather to discuss the violence, which began after a neighbour put a mirror outside his home

Suppressed in mainland China during the Cultural Revolution, it has in recent years become very popular in the West and enjoyed a resurgence in its homeland.

The argument broke out when the 40-year-old discovered his neighbour had put a mirror on the front of his house to deflect evil spirits.

The problem, according to Li, was that the mirror pointed directly at his house. As far as he was concerned that meant he would end up with his neighbour's bad luck.

After the neighbour refused to remove the mirror, a heated argument developed. It turned violent when a second neighbour intervened and tried to get Li to drop the matter.

After killing his neighbours Li smashed the mirror saying that he did not care about what happened, the main thing was that the evil spirits were now no longer being deflected over to his house

A police spokesman said: 'It appears he felt threatened in the confrontation and he grabbed a knife and attacked the other two families involved in the argument, killing three adults, three children and two elderly people.'

Western feng shui enthusiasts have called mirrors the 'aspirin of feng shui', however there are myriad warnings concerning their use.

Mirrors should never reflect doors or windows, toilets, dirty drains, clutter, or another mirror.

If you can see your reflection in the mirror while in bed it will bring a third person into your relationship.
