Pippa Middleton revealed in her first-ever TV interview that she is extremely close to her sister Kate and spending time with family keeps them 'affixed to the ground'.

The 30-year-old told Today that despite her sister's life as a high-profile member of the Royal Family, not much has changed.

Pippa said: 'I mean, obviously she has pressures that
 she's taken on and things. But we spend a lot of time together. We 
still do a lot together as a family.

'And I think that's really the 
heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of 
be normal with each other, treat each other normally. And that's sort 
of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.'

Until now, Pippa, a magazine 
columnist and party-planner, has never spoken publicly on her life in the spotlight - or that 
bridesmaid's dress which brought her so much attention at the Royal 
Wedding in 2011.  

Miss
 Middleton was interviewed by Matt Lauer who had flown to London
 to speak with her for a two-part segment to be aired on Monday and 
Tuesday on NBC.

Lauer asked Pippa if she is still able to call Kate anytime for 'girl talk'.

She said: 'Yeah. Yeah, we do we have a very normal, sisterly relationship. We're very close. And, you know, we support each other and get each other's opinions and things.'

We do we have a very normal,
 sisterly relationship. We're very close. And, you know, we support each
 other and get each other's opinions and things.

Pippa on Kate

The Today host asked Pippa about her impressions of the U.S. during a 
marathon, 3,000-mile cycle across the U.S. with her brother James earlier this month to raise money for charity. 

'Through the trip it was just amazing to go through so many different states and just see the diversity of the landscape, the countryside - it's huge,' she replied. 

'I love it - It's very friendly, very welcoming.  And we felt that the entire way.  And the scenery was incredible.  And I think that what lifted our spirits when it really hurt, sort of grinding on the bike, was to see everything around us. From the mountains, the desert-- through the flat plains of Kansas.'

Pippa Middleton is allegedly being 
offered a correspondent's job with NBC following her first ever TV 
interview, it was revealed on Thursday.

Sources told the New York Post
 that NBC had been after an interview with Pippa for a while and is set 
to offer her a correspondent's role, appearing in special reports.

'The 
heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of 
be normal with each other, treat each other normally.  And that's sort 
of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.'  

Pippa on how the Middletons are surviving fame

It is not thought that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits.

In
 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa, a freelance writer 
and party planner, $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was 
denied by the network.

A source told the Post: 'Pippa could do reports based on her party planning book or her charity work.'

Miss Middleton was dropped by her American publisher Viking Press earlier this year after her 
party-planning book Celebrate sold just 18,000 copies.

It
 was announced in May that Pippa had been dropped as a columnist for The
 Daily Telegraph after just six months. She still writes for Vanity Fair
 and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose.

Clarence House refused to comment on the rumors today as Miss Middleton is not a member of the Royal Family. 

MailOnline was today told the claims were not true, while a spokesman told the Post that the rumor was '100 per cent not true'.

Pippa joked with Lauer as they drank tea during the exclusive TV interview which is due to be aired on Monday and Tuesday next week

She had appeared briefly on camera for the Today show with Lauer on Wednesday as the pair had just finished taping the full interview.

Lauer joked that he had to catch an 
overnight flight to London for his hour-long chat with Pippa, to which 
she responded: 'I hate to say it but I was actually in America last 
week.'

Pippa, who looked immaculate with pared down make-up and a 
glossy blow-dry, giggled at Lauer's feigned protests, adding: 'Sorry.'

The pair chatted over a cup of tea at an outdoor table in a sunny London garden.

Miss
 Middleton, looking tanned in a low-cut white shirt with jeans and 
tasteful gold jewellery, said very little during the minute-long clip 
except to add: 'I was on my bike.'

Pippa and James Middleton along with four other men had 
set off from California last week on the Race Across America with the 
aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity.

They
 cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, 
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa, 30, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Asked
 if she had suffered saddle sores, she laughed and said: 'It wasn't too 
bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly comfy saddle.'

Challenges
 don't stop there for the Celebrate author - she is soon to be on her 
way to Istanbul to take on the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Race, a 6.5km
 historical swim that crosses from Europe to Asia.
