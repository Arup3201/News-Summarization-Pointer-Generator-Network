A west Pennsylvania grandmother has been charged with selling up to 100lbs of marijuana per year since 2009.

Candace Kelly, of Butler County, Pittsburgh, was originally charged for the crime last fall after authorities say they found 64lbs of hydroponically grown marijuana and nearly $400,000 in cash at her home.

The October charges against 64-year-old were dropped as a result of search-and-seizure and probable cause issues.

State police believe Kelly has been buying large quantities of marijuana from a northern California man at $3,300 per pound, then reselling it at a profit of $100 per pound.

The issues with the search-and-seizure related to the previous charges, included accusations from her family that the police had entered Kelly’s home without a warrant, threatened to Taser a 17-year-old and had held the electric shock device against a 15-year-old’s head.

It was in October last year that police entered the Buffalo Township home of Mrs Kelly, where they claim they found the marijuana and the cash.

According to her husband Roger, the officers said they were with the drug interdiction task force, but did not produce any identification before forcing their way into their home while he had to stay at his daughter's house.

The Kelly's two granddaughters were in the house at the time of the arrest and the eldest accused officers of threatening her when she tried to take a photo with her phone.

‘He pointed the Taser at me and said, “Hold it right there,” she told CBS Pittsburgh.

 I said, “What are you going to do? I’m 17 years old, you going to tase me?”

‘He said, “I will tase you like you’re 18 years old”.’

Tuesday's arrest includes charges based on the same allegations, but which are now backed up by a state grand jury report.

Kelly's attorney have yet to return calls for comment.
