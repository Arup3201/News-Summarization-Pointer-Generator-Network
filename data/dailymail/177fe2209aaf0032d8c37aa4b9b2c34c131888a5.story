'I'm an atheist': Eric Fromm, 21, has confessed that he does not believe in God. He is the president of the student body at Northwest Christian University in Oregon

The president of a student body at a Christian university in Oregon has shocked his peers by coming out as an atheist.

Eric Fromm, 21, a senior at Northwest Christian University in Eugene, revealed he does not believe in God in the student-run online newspaper, Beacon Bolt, in a blog post on October 30.

Fromm told the student community that he finally confessing because he was feeling ‘burdened’ by living a constant lie about his faith.

‘I am an atheist. Yes, you read that correctly, I am an atheist,’ he wrote in the blog post he entitled, Lifting the Curtain.

Fromm admitted he chose the school because it had a solid communications program.

‘Before I enrolled, I visited the campus to make sure that the chapel services were comfortable enough that I could fulfil the requirement,’ he said.

‘No one was speaking in tongues or handling snakes, so I decided to stay.’

A journey: Jeannine Jones, the university's director of relations, said Eric's path to his faith is 'central to our mission'

However, he has been living in constant fear of 
his peers rejecting him ‘because of the fact that I don’t believe in God
– because I am an atheist’.

So, he decided to come out.

The university’s director of university relations, Jeannine Jones, told ABC News that this did not come as a surprise.

‘Eric and his journey to his faith are central to our mission,’ she said.

‘All
of our students are on a journey. While the majority of our students 
profess a Christian faith, not all do. We as an institution meet 
students were they are at and believe that our God is big enough.’

The
school’s website says its mission is to ‘highlight our Christian 
identity in ways that unite Christians everywhere, and not in ways that 
tend to cause division between various groups of Christians. In this 
spirit, we believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, 
and we proclaim him Lord and Savior of the world.’

Fromm’s
confessions in Lifting the Curtain have since gone viral on the 
internet and comments from around the world and within the US have 
started to appear.

He is also getting a lot more support at the university than he anticipated.

‘I
was expecting for it to be non-accepting and I was very afraid of it,’ 
Fromm told ABC News. ‘I actually have gotten more hugs than ever 
before. It's a very strange thing.’

Confession: Fromm came out as an atheist in a blog post in the online student newspaper, Beacon Bolt

Some comments in a local paper that picked up on the story, the Eugene Register-Guard, have criticised Fromm’s actions.

‘Atheists actions are quite contradictory. First, they say their lives are like a drop in the ocean. That is, their lives and their actions are but an accident and also insignificant in the whole scheme of things. YET, they go about advertising and preaching their OWN INSIGNIFICANCE?’ said one.

Brandon McGinnis, Fromm's former roommate and editor-in-chief of the Beacon Bolt, said rumours had started to spread around campus that Fromm hated Christians.

‘Eric was upset people were questioning the way they were,’ McGinnis told ABC News.

Fromm, who was baptized Lutheran and raised Methodist, was an atheist before starting at the university.

Fromm, left, published his controversial thoughts in the student-run paper, Beacon Bolt. The paper's editor-in-chief, Brandon McGinnis, right, who is also his former roommate, said rumours had started spreading around campus that Fromm 'hated Christians'. He said it had 'upset' Fromm, as that was not the case

‘For me, church was an empty ritual that I participated in so I could see friends, scripture was largely mythological, and Jesus was a great moral teacher, but he wasn't God,’ said Fromm's post.

Fromm will not be asked to step down as the president of the student body at NCU over this article, according to Jones. 

Fromm said he was also shocked to see how many people online have reached out to him with their own personal stories and also to tell him he was an inspiration to them.

'I have learned so many things about people's struggles,' Fromm said. 'I never really knew that people could struggle, that an atheist could feel this struggle.

'It makes me very happy that I can change people this way, and it's not insulting any religion, and it's not destroying who the person is,' he said.
