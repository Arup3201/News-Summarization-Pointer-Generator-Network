A New Zealand woman who woke up to a horrendous smell and suspicious brown splodges on her home and car, has blamed passing airlines for the mess.

Karen Bass, from Flatbush in Auckland, told the New Zealand Herald that she was sure the 'huge clumps', that she also found on the footpath near her house, were human faeces.

'The first thing when I walked out of my door this morning and I saw it, I thought an airplane s*** on us. You open the door and it smells like s***,' she said.

Karen Bass found her Auckland home and car covered in what she claims was human faeces that fell from a passing plane 

The disgusted resident, whose home is in the flight path for airlines on their way to Auckland International Airport, plans to have a sample of the matter tested.

'There's no way it's a bird or animal poo, it's horrible. I'm sure it's human, what else could it be with huge clumps like that?' Ms Bass told the New Zealand Herald.

Despite not being the first New Zealand citizen to suggest a passing air-plane offloaded human waste above their home, both Airways New Zealand and the country's Civil Aviation Authority deny having record of any incidents.

Sydney Airline safety consultant, Trevor Bock, also expressed doubt over a plane's involvement and suggested Ms Bass' incident was more likely caused by 'bad neighbours'.

'It's certainly not coming from an aircraft because maintenance standards are extremely high today,' Mr Bock told Daily Mail Australia. 

He explained that the waste in a plane goes from the toilet into a sewage tank which is emptied out periodically in a highly controlled environment by specialised trucks carrying large hoses and tanks – often after every second trip.

The fittings for the tank are on the outside of the aircraft and thus only accessible by ground handling staff, meaning a spontaneous mid-air release is difficult to control.

Airline safety consultant, Trevor Bock, said it was 'impossible' that the excrement came from a plane as maintenance standards are extremely high, with trucks collecting the sewage after every second flight

'There's nothing that comes out of a plane unless there's something wrong with it,' the former pilot assured.

'Modern planes use a vacuum system, so the chances of a leak are extremely remote and it would be spotted on the ground before an aircraft departed because the engineers and pilots do a thorough walk around the aircraft before take-off to check on these sorts of things.

'It's just another urban myth.'
