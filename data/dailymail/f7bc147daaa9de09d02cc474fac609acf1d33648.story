Two 17-year-old boys have died after they fell into an ice-covered pond in rural Missouri.

Andre Lance and Tyler Brandt had been walking along a path in Savannah at 4pm on Saturday when they both fell through the sheet of ice into the water, police believe.

By the time investigators responding to a missing persons alert found the boys four hours later, two inches of ice had sealed over them.

Paramedics pronounced both victims dead at the scene.

It comes after Missouri experienced a dramatic drop in temperatures and a sweep of snow driven by a polar vortex in the Midwest.

Andrew County Sheriff Bryan Atkins said: 'We found the vehicle that they had been driving, and it was parked near a farm pond.

'We checked the area, but during that time, it was noticed that there was a hole out in a farm pond.'

Search: Their families issued missing persons appeals on Saturday night and four hours later they were found

Their bodies have been taken for autopsies.

Principal Zac Coughlin of Savannah R-3 High School, which both boys attended, paid tribute to Andre and Tyler, and told News Press Now: 'We will have all district counselors on site as well as counselors from neighboring districts.

'We will be meeting with students and staff as needed.'
