It might come as a surprise to those struggling to comprehend accents from Glasgow, Newcastle or parts of London but the Birmingham accent really is the hardest one to get your tongue around.

But, say authors and language experts David and Ben Crystal, there are some bonuses in being from Birmingham.

While the accent might not be the most popular at home, it sounds positively mellifluous to those hailing from foreign climes.

Now the pair have penned a book in which they decode the mysteries of the British accent - and some of it is nothing short of eye-opening...

Baffling: The stars of BBC drama Peaky Blinders needed extra help to master the tricky Birmingham accent

Some accents are harder to imitate than others, and the Brummie accent is one of the hardest - but with some strong competition from Geordie. 

Of course, difficulty is relative. It depends where you're coming from. A five-year-old growing up in Birmingham will have mastered the accent with no trouble at all. 

But if you compare it to Received Pronunciation - the British prestige accent used by the Queen, and the traditional voice of the BBC - it's easy to see why Brummie is felt to be tricky.

When you notice a regional accent, what you're chiefly noticing are the way people pronounce their long vowels (in words like see, saw, and sue) and diphthongs (in words like say, so, sow, soy, and sigh). 

Appreciated: As Ozzy Osbourne and Cat Deeley have found, the Brummie accent gets a big welcome abroad

English has quite a few of these, and the more an accent sounds them differently from the way you speak, the more difficulty you'll have in 'picking up' that accent. 

Some accents will be very close to your own, so you would have only a few features to learn. But Birmingham and Geordie are two that - compared with Received Pronunciation - have lots of really noticeable differences, such as these three:

• The diphthong in words like float has a much more open onset, so that it sounds more like RP flout.

• The diphthong in words like nice begins with a back and rounded quality, so that it sounds like ‘noice’.

• The diphthong in words like loud begins with a front and higher quality, so that it sounds more like ‘le-ood’.

No wonder actress Helen McCrory looked for help while working on the first series of Peaky Blinders, asking a Birmingham-born actress for guidance about her accent.

No bar to office: Neville Chamberlain, who was Prime Minister between 1937 and 1940, had a Brummie accent

BRUMMIE ACCENTS ARE LOVED ABROAD

In Britain, during the 20th century, thanks to the way it was portrayed on radio and television, the Brummie accent picked up all kinds of negative atitudes. 

But abroad, it's perceived in a very different way. Once, in a summer school for foreign learners of English, I played the students a dozen British accents and asked them to rate them for beauty. Brummie came top.

More evidence: Not long ago, a nightclub owner in Israel advertised in Birmingham's Sunday Mercury for staff to come and work in his club during the winter months. 

The owner said: 'I love the accent, and nightclub-goers can't get enough of it over here. I believe you can go a long way if you can speak the Birmingham way'. 

And he concludes: 'I've heard enough holiday-makers from the region to know it's the best accent by far'.

RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION HASN'T BEEN AROUND VERY LONG 

Received Pronunciation is only around 200 years old. It emerged towards the end of the 18th century as an upper-class accent, and soon became the voice of the public schools, the civil service, and the British Empire. 

When the BBC began broadcasting, in the 1920's, its founder, Lord Reith (a Scot) opted for RP as the BBC's voice on the grounds that it would be the most widely understood.

BRITAIN HAS MORE ACCENTS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 

There are more accents per square mile in Britain than in any other part of the English-speaking world. 

This is because of the hugely diverse history of English in the British Isles, with the originally Germanic dialects of Europe mixing with the Norse accents of the Vikings, the French accents of the Normans, and wave after wave of immigration from the Middle Ages down to the present day. 

But it's also because of the rise of 'mixed' accents, as people move house around the country and pick up features of the accent wherever they find themselves.

WE ALL HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACCENT 

Everyone has more than one accent. Our pronunciation changes subtly depending on who we're talking to and how we get on with them. 

Linguists call it 'accommodation'. Some people have a natural flair for picking up accents, but everyone does it to some extent. Unconsciously, of course. 

You only notice you've done it when someone asks 'Are you from round here?' and you can't think of a satisfactory reply.

BRITISH IS NO LONGER THE ONLY 'ENGLISH' ACCENT 

There are now far more English accents outside the British Isles than within. Accents express the identity of a community, so in every country that English has come to be used - and that means everywhere - a new accent has evolved.

And when you think that there are over two billion people speaking English now, that's a lot of accents.
