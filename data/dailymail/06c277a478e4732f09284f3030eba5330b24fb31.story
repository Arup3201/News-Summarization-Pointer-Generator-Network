Hundreds of jobs were under threat last night at three of BAE Systems’ shipyards.

Unions were due to meet defence chiefs today to discuss the future amid speculation more than 1,000 jobs may be axed.

BAE is expected to announce the cuts as early as tomorrow.

The future of the yards has been in question for months amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are completed.

Livelihoods: Workers at the BAE Systems shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. As many as 1,000 jobs may be lost at three of the company's UK shipyards amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are finished

Some of the jobs set to be lost at the Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun shipyards may be offset by a contract to build a new Royal Navy carrier, the Type 26 Global Combat Ship.

But BAE Systems has yet to announce which of its UK bases will carry out the work.

The Govan and Scotstoun yards in Scotland are politically sensitive ahead of next year’s referendum on Scottish independence.

A BAE spokeswoman said: ‘We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future.

‘This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses.’

Scotland’s Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘We have been in dialogue for some time with BAE Systems on the issues surrounding the future of the Clyde shipyards.

‘We are awaiting the outcome of BAE’s discussions with the Ministry of Defence and are very alert to the situation concerning both yards.

‘We are seeking urgent clarity on the future for both Govan and Scotstoun.’

Hugh Scullion, Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary said: ‘We have secured talks with senior BAE systems executives early next week to examine the business case of the forthcoming announcement.

‘Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring, this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are.

‘The shipbuilding workforce throughout the UK are working flat out to deliver the aircraft carriers for the defence of the UK and they need to know what lies in store for them, their families and their communities.’

A GMB union spokesman added: ‘Full time union officials and shop stewards will meet BAE next week to go over the detailed business case on how work will be organised once the carrier programme winds down.’

BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago.

Vernon Coaker MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said: ‘There will be huge anxiety amongst the highly skilled workforce, their families and the communities they live in.

‘This has significant consequences for the future of shipbuilding in the UK and has implications for the future defence of our country.’
