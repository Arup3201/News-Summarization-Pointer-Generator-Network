Two physicists have produced some tips for men hoping to avoid 'splashback' when using the toilet, by studying the physics of urinal usage.

Using high-speed videos of a stream of simulated urine, the scientists pinpointed when men are at most risk of splashback and stressed the importance of 'good technique' when using urinals.

Their research shows reduced splash can be achieved by aiming at a vertical surface, moving closer to the urinal and by decreasing the impact angle.

Physicists have explored the physics of weeing. They believe most of the splashback caused by male urination is because of 'Plateau-Rayleigh instability,' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets (pictured at the beginning of the stream of simulated urine)

In news that will not surprise cleaners and dry cleaners, physicists Todd Truscott and Randy Hurd, who call themselves the wizz kids, said that 'significant splashback' occurs when using a urinal.

Writing on their blog at Utah-based Brigham Young University's Incompressible Fluids Lab, they said: 'The amount of splash is considerable and should make one reconsider standing up to urinate.'

The scientists filmed streams of simulated urine entering a body of water similar to that of a toilet.

Mr Hurd told the BBC that most of the mess caused by male urination is because of 'Plateau-Rayleigh instability,' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets.

'So by the time it [the urine] hits the urinal, it's already in droplet form and these droplets are the perpetrators of the splash formation on your khaki pants.'

They discovered that the repeated impact of the stream of droplets, creates a 'large and interesting cavity with multiple ridges'.

Splashback occurs at the point the droplets hit the surface of the water, as well as when the large cavity collapses

Each droplet forms a small cavity, enabling the next droplet to pass through and for a cavity of its own, creating a chain of small cavities.

'The process repeats itself over and over, creating a real mess' they said.

However, after studying their videos, they discovered that reduced splash can be achieved for cleaner bathrooms, trousers and happy bathroom goers.

In their instructions to men, they said:  'First, aim 
for a vertical surface rather than a horizontal one and keep away from 
the water bowl. 

'Second, get close enough that the stream remains a 
stream rather than breaking up into droplets.

'Third, aim at an angle to
the urinal either by aiming sideways or downward.'
