Benjamin Ritchie has been jailed after posing online as 'Marina', forming a friendship with another woman and persuading her to sleep with him

A twisted predator tricked a woman into having sex with him by posing as his own wife online.

Benjamin Ritchie, from Derbyshire, called himself 'Marina' and struck up a friendship online with a woman, in her 20s, before asking her to help expose her cheating husband.

The woman was asked by 35-year-old Ritchie, as 'Marina', to go around to their home and have sex with her husband, Benjamin, film the events and send her the recording.

After the woman had complied she received a message from 'Marina' threatening if she did not continue to have sex with Benjamin and film it, then the initial sex recording would be sent to her family and work colleagues.

Under duress, the woman engaged in sexual activity again with Ritchie on a number of occasions before she became suspicious and reported him to police.

Ritchie, who admitted rape and two counts of sexual assault, was jailed for seven years at Derby Crown Court.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Claudia Musson said: 'Ritchie preyed on a vulnerable young woman and deceived her at every turn.

'She was left deeply traumatised by what he did but she showed great courage in coming forward and speaking to police.

'Although seven years is a pleasing sentence, it doesn't compensate for what he did.

'I just hope his victim can now try to move on with her life in the knowledge that he has been jailed.

'I would urge people to be careful when talking to people online.

'When forming relationships via the internet, you can easily be lulled into a false sense of security, which in turn can leave you very vulnerable.'

Ritchie, of Borrowash, Derbyshire, must sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely and obey a sexual offences prevention order which prohibits him from possessing any software to delete internet history.
