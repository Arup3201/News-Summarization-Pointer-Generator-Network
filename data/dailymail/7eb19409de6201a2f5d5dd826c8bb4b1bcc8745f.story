The UK has to weather just three more days of wind and rain before a long-awaited 'more usual' summer pattern arrives, forecasters predict.

Downpours are expected to be largely gone by the end of the week, paving the way for some much-anticipated summer sun - in the south at least.

Saturday will be dry and bright in most places in England, Wales and southern Scotland, with highs of 19C in the South. But while heavy rain will return to northern Scotland and Northern Ireland on Sunday, central and southern England can expect to bask in bright sunshine and highs of 21C.

A cloud burst floods the pitch during the under 19 One Day 
International between England and Ireland at Grace Road, Leicester. Wet 
and thundery weather is on the way for the next three days before the 
sun arrives

Downpour: The pitch is completely submerged after the torrential downpour at Grace Road, Leicester

Outlook: Sunshine will make an appearance around midday on Saturday, left, and on Sunday, right, it will be out in force in south and central England. However, the north of England and Scotland will be wetter

Meanwhile, the start of next week will be breezy with rain in the 
north and Scotland. However, it will be dry and fine in the rest of the UK, 
gradually getting warmer throughout the week.

Widespread flooding, the wettest period 
of April to June on record and more heavy rain so far this month has 
been caused by the jet stream settling unusually far south.

Experts believe it is on its 
way back north, which could herald more traditional summer 
weather in time for the start of the Olympic Games.

Claire
Austin, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the Press Associationâ€™s weather 
division, said there would still be unsettled weather today.

She said: 'There will be a band of 
slow-moving heavy rain through central and northern parts of Scotland 
today, which will sit there most of the day bringing quite a lot of 
rain.

'England and Wales are going to see a showery band of rain moving eastwards, with sunshine and showers following behind.

'The heaviest of the rainfall and more frequent heavy showers will be across north Wales, the north Midlands and Lincolnshire, where there will be frequent lightning strikes and thunder storms.

'As we go through tonight the general trend across England and Wales will see most of the showers die away. But the band of rain across Scotland will sink south and east through the night.'

On Thursday and Friday there will be a mixture of sunshine and showers, with a risk of the odd heavier shower in central and eastern parts of England.

The Environment Agency, which has been inundated in dealing with flooding across the UK in recent weeks, has 20 flood alerts currently in place, and no flood warnings.
