 Former Bolton striker Delroy Facey has been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into match-fixing.

Facey, 34, will appear at Cannock Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He was one of six men arrested in November after the National Criminal Agency looked into an alleged plot to influence the outcome of matches and has been on bail since then.

The striker, who represented 14 clubs in all, made 10 appearances in the Premier League for Bolton under Sam Allardyce in 2002 and 2003. Overall he scored 77 goals in 512 games in a career that ended at Hereford in 2012.

The investigation has already led to the conviction of Singaporean fixer Chann Sankaran, businessman Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan and another former player, Michael Boateng, in June after they were found to have paid footballers to influence the outcome of matches so that others could profit through betting on the result.

The trio were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery. Sankaran and Ganeshan were sentenced to five years in jail, while Boateng was jailed for 16 months.
