Two Connecticut parents whose 6-year-old son was tragically taken away in the Newtown massacre welcomed a new baby boy into their lives last week.

Francine and David Wheeler are now the proud parents of Matthew Bennett Wheeler.

They told CBS News the new baby 'was bringing light and joy into their lives.'

Their older son Nate said he wants to be the best older brother he can be.

In the wake of the the December 2012 horror at Sandy Hook Elementary, the Wheelers set up a charitable organization called Ben’s Lighthouse 'in honor of Ben Wheeler and his Sandy Hook classmates to promote the long-term health of the children and families in the region while nurturing an environment of non-violence and caring.'

The couple and their son moved to Sunnyside, New York after the tragedy.

According to the website for Ben's Lighthouse, their slain son was 'quick to smile, quick to laugh, eyes sparkling always with his love of everything (and a good deal of mischief) he was an energetic spirit.'

Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle inside Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14.

He also shot and killed his mother inside their home before driving to the school, and took his own life with a handgun as police arrived.

The shooting plunged the small New England community into mourning, elevated gun safety to the top of the agenda for President Barack Obama and led states across the country to re-evaluate laws on issues including school safety
