MPs yesterday passed an historic vote to stop TV licence fee dodgers from going to jail.

Politicians from all three main parties agreed to strip the BBC of its powers to prosecute viewers in the criminal courts.

It is a victory for campaigners who compared existing laws – which allow people to be sent to prison simply because they are unable or unwilling to pay the £145.50 annual charge – to a ‘banana republic’.

Debate: The BBC has voiced fears that it will lose revenue if it no longer has the power to prosecute

Under the new proposals, fee evasion will become a civil offence punishable with a fine, similar to missing a gas bill or not paying your Sky TV subscription.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen – who jointly proposed the law change after gathering the support of 150 backbenchers – welcomed the vote, saying existing laws are a ‘shameful blot on our justice system’.

The proposal also won the backing of Crown Prosecution Service director Alison Saunders and former BBC chairman Michael Grade. In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates’ court cases.

Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines.

Yesterday, the 19 MPs on a committee considering the new Deregulation Bill voted in favour of an amendment that could end criminal sanctions when the BBC’s charter comes up for renewal in 2016.

Support: Former BBC chairman Michael Grade was in favour of a law change after 190,000 were prosecuted

The change – which is expected to become law by the autumn – calls for a year-long review of BBC funding with detailed examination of the case for decriminalisation.

The review’s findings will then be presented to the BBC Trust and both Houses of Parliament before further law changes end criminal sanctions for licence fee evasion.

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Bridgen compared the BBC’s  current draconian powers to those of a third-world dictatorship.

He said: ‘Imagine the condemnation if the BBC had learnt of a banana republic introducing a poll tax on its citizens, irrespective of income, for them to be able to have access to television. Imagine also if this poll tax were enforced by the threat of prison sentences which disproportionately saw women with children detained by the state.

‘There’s no need to imagine this scenario, because it is exactly the position we currently have in this country.’

Detection: The BBC has warned taking away the threat of prosecution will lose it £200million a year

The BBC warned that decriminalisation could lead to it losing £200million in revenue.

However, director of corporate and public affairs Andrew Scadding said yesterday: ‘This approach is a sensible one as it means that all parties will be able to consider any changes to the current system with a clear understanding of the consequences that will follow.’

The BBC will become less populist and broadcast more Shakespeare, opera and literary festivals, it was announced yesterday.

Director general Tony Hall unveiled a series of high-brow TV programmes, including the return of history series Civilisation, and a £2.75 million boost to arts programming. He said: ‘This is the strongest commitment to the arts we’ve made in a generation. We’re the biggest arts broadcaster in the world, but our ambition is to be even better.’
