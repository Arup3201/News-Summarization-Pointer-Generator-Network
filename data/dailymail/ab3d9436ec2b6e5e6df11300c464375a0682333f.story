A medical student died after refusing to call an ambulance when she felt unwell, an inquest has heard.

Sarah Houston, 23, was studying at Leeds University and  told friends her symptoms would pass. But a flatmate found her dead the following day.

An inquest heard yesterday that the cause of death is not yet known.

Shocking episode: Medical student Sarah Houston, 23, was found dead in her bedroom by a flatmates after telling her fellow medical students that her symptoms would pass

Miss Houston, from Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, had told the other medical students she lived with that she was feeling hot and unwell.

Flatmate Sarah Carpenter said Miss Houston was sweating and breathing heavily, the court was told.

Her flatmates advised her to call an ambulance, but the student insisted several times it was not unusual for her to feel that way and that her symptoms would pass.

One of her housemates left her phone on 'loud' so Miss Houston could call in the night if she felt worse, Leeds Coroner's court was told.

The other student went to check on her sick housemate in the morning, but said she did not see her in her bedroom.

Tragedy: The young woman was found lying on the floor of her bedroom by a horrified housemate after complaining of feeling hot and unwell a day earlier. The cause of death is not yet known

Miss Houston apparently texted her friend later in the day, but she was discovered at 4.30pm by two of her flatmates, lying between her bed and the wardrobe at their home in Hyde Park, Leeds, the court heard.

Paramedics were called and pronounced her dead at the scene at around 5.15pm on Tuesday, September 25.

A post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Lisa Barker, a consultant histopathologist at St Jamesâ€™s Hospital in Leeds, could not determine the cause of death.

Coroner David Hinchliff said: 'As things stand at the moment, we do not have any medical history.

'No cause of death is available at 
this stage and additional tests will need to be made to assist in 
finding the cause of death.'

'An adjournment will be made for that purpose and for further enquiries to be made.'

In mourning: Leeds University said it was doing all it could to support Miss Houston's friends and fellow students

A cremation order was made and an interim death certificate was issued to allow a funeral to take place while the court awaits toxicology and other results.

Katie Siddall, Welfare Officer at Leeds 
University Union, said: 'We were extremely saddened to hear the news 
that Sarah Houston had passed away, to lose someone so young is such a 
tragedy. Our thoughts are with Sarah's family and friends at what must 
be a very difficult time.'

A Leeds University spokesperson said: 'We were sorry to learn of the death of one of our students.

'Our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'Staff in her school are working to ensure her friends and fellow students are supported at this difficult time.'
