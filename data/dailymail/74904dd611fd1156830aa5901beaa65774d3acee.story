Holidaymakers are being warned to ease up on the accelerator if they’re driving in Spain this summer, or risk facing tougher penalties for speeding.

The popular tourist hotspot has introduced harsh new driving laws, fining motorists up to £325 on the spot for going just 1km per hour over the speed limit.

And for motorists caught committing serious speeding offences, the increased fines could now set them back almost £500, warns holiday rental company Europcar.  

Spain's tough new penalties for speeding could catch holidaymakers by surprise

 The top speed on Spain’s motorways and dual carriageways have been raised to 130kmph from 120kmph.

But speeds on residential roads have been reduced from 30kmph to just 20kmph, with limits of 50kmph on urban roads.

In addition to fines, UK motorists have been warned they risk losing points on their licence for any driving offences committed within continental Europe.

Higher fines in Spain or other countries may catch visitors by surprise as European nations get tougher on out-of-country drivers.

Brits who will be hiring a car while they are abroad are encouraged to brush up on local driving laws before they leave home.

Spain and France are two countries where motorists could face on-the-spot fines.

In France, there have been reports of drivers being taken to local cash points if they don’t have enough cash to pay the fine.

Police in Spain and other European countries could order offenders to pay a fine on the side of the road

Ken McCall, Managing Director of Europcar UK Group, said: ‘Whichever country you are visiting, don’t get caught out by assuming that foreigners will be exempt from the law.

‘Make sure you do your homework before arriving at your destination so that you remember the trip for all the right reasons.’

Proper planning should also include a travel kit, containing warning triangles, a visibility vest and other essentials, in case of a breakdown.

The advice comes as the AA prepares for its busiest month of the year.

More than half of all breakdowns recorded by the AA happen during the summer and the average cost of a breakdown in Europe is £612, according to a survey conducted by AA and Populus.

France, Ireland, Germany, Spain and Belgium are the most common destinations for a breakdown to occur.

The usual problems are engine trouble or the car not starting, followed by flat or damaged tyres, faulty batteries or a collision.

Be prepared: A car travel kit, including hazard triangles, is legally required in some countries

Edmund King, AA President, said: ‘August is the peak holiday season for road trips when many families and friends embark on long journeys to Europe in their cars.

‘There are more cars on the road than other times of the year and temperatures are higher than usual, making overheating an issue.’

He added: ‘Many don’t realise that breaking down while driving on European roads can add over £600 to the cost of the holiday.

‘Before heading off, motorists should ensure that they have prepared their vehicles for the journey.’
