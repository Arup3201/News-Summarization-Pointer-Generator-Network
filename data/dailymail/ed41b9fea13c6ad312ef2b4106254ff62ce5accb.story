On Sunday viewers saw the girls hit Fifth Avenue for a shopping spree as news of Binky Felstead and Alex Mytton's split emerged.

The cast  - including Jamie Laing, who is famous for his 'Yeah Boi' catchphrase, and ladies man Spencer Matthews - were also seen sipping champagne during a lavish rooftop brunch in Midtown.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, says: 'Since the show first aired on our screens back in 2011, Brits have taken a keen interest in the lives of the Made in Chelsea cast.

'New York is a cosmopolitan mecca, and Sunday's show reaffirmed just that.

'There are some fantastic deals on New York hotels at the moment, and if Brits do their research online, they will be able to take advantage of some great deals, meaning they too can drink champagne from the rooftops.' 

In June, Hotels.com saw a 72 per cent increase in searches to Marbella after rival show The Only Way Is Essex gang hit the Spanish resort for a two-part spin-off show.
