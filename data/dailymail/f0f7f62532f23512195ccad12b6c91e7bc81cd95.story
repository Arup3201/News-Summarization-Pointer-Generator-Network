A teenager allegedly enlisted the help of two friends to tie up his mother and drag her by the hair across her floor so that they could steal guns on Friday afternoon.

As soon as the police arrived at the Georgia home, Joseph Coddington, 17, his friend Quenton Harris, 17, along with a third 14-year-old female whose name was not released fled the home where they allegedly tied Regina Coddington to her bed so they could rob her of firearms.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that the teens were arrested later that day on charges including burglary, false imprisonment, kidnapping, criminal damage to property and obstruction.

Deputies were called to Regina Coddington's home at around 2 p.m. on Saturday after a neighbor allegedly saw the teens climb in through a storm window.

Rockdale County Police say when they arrived that they found the woman tied to her bed by her hands and feet with a purple rope.

Regina Coddington told police that her son threatened to kill her if she called for help and that they dragged her around the home and tied her up.

Police say that in the dining room of the home they found a locked steel gun case that'd been allegedly hammered at by the teens who were attempting to open it.

Police also found a crowbar, a drill, and safety glasses alongside the case.

The neighbor who saw the teens enter the home told deputies he saw Joseph Coddington break in my removing a storm window and then opened the door to let his friends inside.

In order to find the teenagers the deputies used k-9 dogs to track the suspects near the house, said Cpl. Michael camp on Tuesday. Police were forced to lockdown a local elementary school as well. 

Quenton Harris was arrested at 2:30 pm near Goode Road and Stanton Road behind a house.

The 14-year-old female suspect was found near Goode Road and Stanton Road at 3:30 p.m. and Joseph Coddington was found around 5 p.m. in the same area.

Harris and Coddington were taken to the Rockdale County jail and the 14-year-old girl was taken to the Rockdale Youth Detention Center.

Manhunt: The teens fled the Rockdale County home when police arrived so the department sent out a k-9 unit to track the teens in the area around the home
