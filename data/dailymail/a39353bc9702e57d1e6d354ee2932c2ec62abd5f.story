One family of troublemakers has cost taxpayers more than £250,000 in efforts to help them change their ways.

The unnamed family from Havering, east London, has received advice on a number of areas, including parenting and debt management, over the last two years as part of the government's Troubled Families scheme - all paid for out of the public purse.

A spokeswoman for Havering Council confirmed that the family are still on the scheme, meaning their issues are still not resolved.

The family, which is believed to have several children, has sucked in £100,000 more than the average household on the scheme and more than three times the £72,696 a normal law abiding UK family can expect to earn during the same two-year period.

The scheme, introduced after the 2011 riots, aims at getting households struggling with drug, crime and behavioural issues back on the straight and narrow but can, so far, only boast a nine per cent success rate.

Jonathan Isaby, the chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Daily Mirror: 'Those that cannot change their ways should not be entitled to limitless support at the expense of their law-abiding neighbours.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the programme was saving the taxpayer money by reducing the level of crime.
