Michael Owen believes Arsenal will fail in their bid to reach the top four this coming season, despite Arsene Wenger splashing the cash on Alexis Sanchez.

The former Manchester United, Liverpool and England striker says despite being impressed with the Sanchez signing, Arsenal have 'lagged a step behind' other clubs in recent years.

Arsenal have been linked with another top signing in World Cup winner and Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira, but Owen told talkSPORT he sees the top four including Manchester United instead of the Gunners.

‘I have been really impressed with Arsenal’s signing of Sanchez,’ he said. ‘They have been missing a bit of quality but [they’ll miss out].

‘The signing of Sanchez has made everyone sit up and take note. I really do rate him, he’s a top player and it’s a big step in the right direction.

‘But, in no particular order, my top four for next season would be Chelsea, Man City, Man United and Liverpool.

‘Arsenal haven’t had any real stand out players in the last few years, like Thierry Henry. They have just lagged a step behind.’
