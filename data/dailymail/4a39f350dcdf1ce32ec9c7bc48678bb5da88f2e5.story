Nick Clegg has revealed he has never smacked his own children, but refused to be drawn on whether other parents should.

The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged over an admission by Great British Bake-Off star Mary Berry that she used to hit her children with a wooden butter pat if they misbehaved.

Mr Clegg insisted he does not ‘use a wooden spoon’ to discipline his three sons, but insisted raising children can be incredibly frustrating and leave parents wanting to ‘pull your hair out’.

Parenting: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he and wife Miriam do not smack their three sons

Miss Berry revealed last week that she would smack her children when they were young, and insisted it did not do them any harm.

The 78-year-old said she reached for the kitchen utensil if Thomas, Annabel and William were naughty. She said: 'We had corporal punishment in our house. I don't think it hurts them too much, a quick slap on the legs. They would run very fast.'

Today Mr Clegg repeatedly refused to be drawn on whether Miss Berry was wrong to hit her children, saying he had never met her and did not know what the circumstances were.

But he said he and wife Miriam have never smacked their sons,  Antonio, 11, nine year-old Alberto and Miguel, four.

Speaking on his weekly LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, he was asked by listener Rachel in Barrow if he smacked his own children.

Mr Clegg said: ‘No, like all parents I
sometimes have to restrain myself if they don’t go to bed on time or do
their homework. But no, we do not… No, I don’t smack my children.’

He
said he had also not been smacked as a child: ‘No, I don’t ever 
remember my parents doing that. My parents were quite strict but their 
authority was such that they didn’t need to.

‘There were four of us, and my brothers, my sister and I were fairly strong boisterous characters but they kept us in line.’

But challenged about Miss Berry’s comments, Mr Clegg said he was ‘incredibly reluctant’ to pass comment.

‘All
I’m saying is I really don’t think politicians should start providing 
parenting lessons to parents of this country.

'Parenting is an incredibly
difficult thing to do.

‘It can be very frustrating, children can absolutely… you want to pull your hair out sometimes they can be so difficult. But the way that I and Miriam and I choose is not by smacking. I do not use a wooden spoon.’

Miss Berry’s revelation reopened the debate about smacking, and whether times have moved on from the age of parents regularly hitting their children as a form of discipline.

Asked if Miss Berry had been wrong, Mr Clegg replied: ‘She’s the mother of her children, I’m not going to start second guessing.

'I have no idea what a tap with a wooden spoon means.

‘It’s really, really important that you don’t start judging parents until you know exactly what happened, why they did it.

‘I am not going to start becoming terribly judgemental about what other parents have done with their children.

‘You should not in my view inflict violence on children, you certainly do anything which is against the law.’

Mr Clegg said he had ‘no idea’ whether a 
gentle tap on the legs was appropriate or not. ‘It’s certainly not 
appropriate if you do something that inflicts pain.’

But he admitted that he at times has had to physically restrain his three sons. ‘Have I pulled my child away from something? Yes.

‘The idea that you can be a parent and never ever physically move your child. Or have I taken my child’s hand and say right you’re off that Nintendo now… of course you do that.

‘It’s absurd to suggest parents do not have physical contact with their children.

‘You are asking me to adjudicate o, and I simply won’t, is what exactly another parent has done to their child in circumstances I’m not aware of.

‘Assuming by the way that they don’t do anything which is cruel, or gratuitous or violent or still worse illegal.

Miss Berry tied the knot with husband Paul, now 80 and a retired seller of antique books, in 1966.

However, tragedy struck when their son William died in a car crash aged 19.

William had decided to take the car to go and buy a newspaper with his sister Annabel.

But he went around a corner too fast and was killed. Annabel escaped unhurt.
