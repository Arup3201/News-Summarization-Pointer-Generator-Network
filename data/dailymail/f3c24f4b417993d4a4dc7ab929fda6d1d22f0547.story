Barcelona have aimed a dig at Cesc Fabregas for not scoring enough goals during his three years with club.

The midfielder, who signed for Chelsea for £30million on Thursday, scored 42 goals in 151 matches for the Spanish giants.

But the club claim there was a 'downward trend in his stats every season' and that Fabregas 'was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first.'

Despite admitting Fabregas' goal return was an 'impressive tally for a midfielder', Barcelona suggest this was down to the fact that he mainly played 'in the "false centre forward" role.'

A statement on the club's official website said: 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc’s contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close.

'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season. He only scored one, six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season.

'For some reason, he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first.'

Fabregas' Spanish team-mate Xavi, however, was more positive about the 27-year-old.

He said: 'Its great news for him. I have seen him andhe is looking very happy. He will be an important loss for Barcelona but I know it is what he wanted. He is my friend and I wish him well.'

Xavi also responded to suggestions that Spain need to change the way they play football if the want to triump at the World Cup.

He added: 'We will play the same way. We are going to win or die with this style of football.'
