'Maths' and 'mesmerising' aren’t words you often hear in the same sentence.

But these dancing shapes, created by student Dave Whyte, could change your view on the beauty hidden in numbers.

Mr Whyte’s GIFs have been swirling, bouncing and twisting their way around the internet for a number of years – but his latest creations are the most spellbinding yet.

The Dublin-based student began a Tumblr called Bees & Bombs in 2011 on which he published his own quirky GIFs drawing inspiration from films.

But then he stumbled on an open source programming language called Processing, which is designed to help people create images and animations.

'I was initially inspired by http://dvdp.tumblr.com/, I was absolutely blown away when I discovered his work first,' Mr Whyte told MailOnline.

'My first geometric GIFS were shameless imitations of his.'

Using his background in mathematics and physics, Mr Whyte began exploring something known as motion geometry to create fascinating shapes.

In this series, his minimalistic use of shapes and colour draw attention to motion, symmetry and ordered patterns.

Processing is an open source language designed to help people create images and animations.

It was initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals using images. 

But the software has now evolved. Today, it is used by artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who to create animations and test out their prototype designs. 

From a hexagon wave, to moving coloured cubes and rainbow spirals, each of the student's designs reveal structured rules drawn from equations. 

Mr Whyte is keen to share his methods and frequently posts source code and tips to help other artists on Twitter.

'My process is basically that I come up with a fully-formed idea and try to get it into GIF form before I've forgotten it,' said Mr Whyte.

'After a quick sketch in pen (and sometimes a bit of trigonometry) I code the GIF the programming language Processing.'

He is now focusing more on his artistic side of his work, using maths to create designs that are both beautiful and hypnotising.

The designer claims to be able to see his animation before he creates them. He then makes changes to colour, timing and measurements during the production process.

'I can see the GIF format itself dying in the future: it was standardised in the 80s and feels like it,' said Mr Whyte.

'For most uses you end up with very big files or very low quality. But it's so widely supported so it'll be a while before it's gone.

'But as far as people making short little abstract animations, I can't see any reason why they'd ever stop, even if we need to switch to a more modern format.'

More animations can be seen on Mr Whyte’s Tumblr blog, which archives his work to date.
