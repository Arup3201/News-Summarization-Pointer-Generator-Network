A taxi driver who drove onto a beach had to be rescued by holidaymakers after being stranded by the incoming tide.

Polish driver Krzysztof Tomaszek was seen driving through the waves as the water surrounded his vehicle.

Concerned members of the public went and rescued him from the Ford Mondeo on Brean beach in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset.

Dave Borton said he called the coastguard after seeing the car was being swamped by water on Sunday evening.

'I was concerned for his safety - he 
was trying to drive the car to safety through the waves even though the 
sea had totally surrounded the vehicle,' he said.

'I
called the Coastguard and, with the help of another holidaymaker, we 
managed to get him out of the car and then a few of his belongings.'

Mr Tomaszekwho was shaken and cold but otherwise unhurt, thanked those who came to his rescue.

He said: 'I drove onto the beach at 4.30pm and when I bought my parking ticket someone said I could stay until the beach closed at 8pm, but I was unaware that there was a very high tide.'

'We went off for a walk and I was shocked to come back and find the car surrounded by the sea.

'I managed to get in and tried to drive it away but the engine kept cutting out and two guys helped me out of the car by opening the driver's door and getting some belongings out. They were just great.'

Brean's beach warden and Coastguards from Burnham-On-Sea were quickly on the scene but there was nothing that could be done to save the vehicle.

Beach motorists have again been advised to check tide times before using the beach.

Brean beach is the second longest stretch of sand in Europe and lies on the north Somerset coast which has some of the fastest and highest tidal ranges in the world.

Rescuer: Holidaymaker Dave Borton was one of two holidaymakers who helped the driver get out of his sinking taxi
