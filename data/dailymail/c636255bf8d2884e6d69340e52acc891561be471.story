A hot air balloon pilot has died after falling from the basket while trying to land in a Philadelphia field.

Police said Jeffrey Hooten, 47, reached for a rope to deflate the balloon when he fell and was crushed under the basket on Sunday.

The father, from New Mexico, was dragged along the ground as 10 passengers watched in horror.

Police Chief James Franciscus said people were performing CPR when officers arrived, but Hooten died later at Phoenixville Hospital.

The balloon was landing near the corner of Hunsberger Road and South Wall Street in the East Pikeland Township about 7.45am Sunday, according to WCHE 1520AM.

Hooten's grief stricken daughter shared touching pictures on social media of her with her dad, alongside an emotional post.

'Happy Father's Day daddy, the eighteen years that you gave me are better than I could ask for,' she wrote.

'From the time that you got yourself a horse just so you could spend time with me or the time we spontaneously dug a hole for a little pond that quickly began to resemble a lake in our backyard, you always knew how to make life fun.

'There is so much that I still have to tell you and my heart is broken that you are gone so soon. Rest in peace dad.'

A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration said preliminary information indicated that Hooten fell out when the balloon bounced after a hard landing.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The NTSB did not have any other details by early Monday afternoon.

Hooten worked for the U.S. Hot Air Balloon Team of Warwick. Spokesman Stan Hess said he did not want to comment until an autopsy was complete.

The Chester County coroner's office has not released a cause of death.
