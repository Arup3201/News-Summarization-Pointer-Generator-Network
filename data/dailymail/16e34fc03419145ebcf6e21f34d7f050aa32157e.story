Police in New Zealand are appealing to overseas tourists - possibly including Australians - who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect 'something happened to them there' to come forward with their stories.

The appeal went out on Wednesday to British and other male overseas travellers after a 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers' lodge appeared in court on dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged.

But police said they suspect Michael Harris allegedly assaulted many other young men, mostly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25, who stayed at the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years in the small town of Kaitaia - which has a population of 5,100 - on the northern tip of the North Island.

It is alleged Michael Harris allegedly assaulted 16 male backpackers in a lodge he owned in Kaitaia on New Zealand's North Island

Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court on Wednesday, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings.

He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18.

The New Zealand Herald reported police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years.

The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence.

Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations.

‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson.

‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions,’ the Herald quoted him as saying.

Victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years 

Police allege the 54-year-old drugged the men from overseas countries - possibly including those from Australia

‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required.

‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’

To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address.

Backpackers who believe they might have been indecently assaulted are asked to contact this email address: operations@police.govt.nz
