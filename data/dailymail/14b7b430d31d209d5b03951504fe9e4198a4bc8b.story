Astronaut Scott Kelly's identical twin pulled a fast one on NASA right before his brother blasted off on a one-year space station mission by showing up at the launch without his usual mustache.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Scott Kelly, who was heading into space, on Monday that he almost had a heart attack when his brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, showed up at the launch.

'He fooled all of us,' Bolden said. Mark Kelly's mustache was 'the only way I can tell you two apart', he told Scott.

Mustache-less Mark Kelly (bottom) had a chance to speak with the astronauts (top), including his brother Scott (top left) once they got to the International Space Station.

Mark, a former space shuttle commander, was still clean shaven as of Monday afternoon, as he chatted with Bolden about the unprecedented medical experiments planned on the twins over the coming year. 

Doctors want to see how the space twin's body compares with his genetic double on the ground.

In a series of ten investigations, doctors will look at the subtle differences that could occur between the brother on earth and the brother in space. 

Experiments will look at physiology, shifts in behavior, decision making and alertness, according to People.  

Scott Kelly arrived at the International Space Station on Friday night following a launch from Kazakhstan. 

He will remain on board for 342 days, until next March, with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko.

It will be NASA's longest spaceflight ever.

'It's like coming to my old home,' said Kelly, who spent five months at the space station in 2010-2011.

The White House sent congratulations to the astronauts on Monday.

President Barack Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, wished Kelly, Kornienko and the rest of the crew the best of luck and noted that the yearlong mission is an important milestone on the path to sending humans to Mars in the mid-2030s.

'You guys are all heroes up there, and we're depending on you,' Holdren said in a phone hookup.

Mark Kelly, meanwhile, paid tribute to the brothers' father, who stayed behind in Houston for last week's launch. 

Richard Kelly, a retired and widowed police officer, is the only parent to endure a child's rocket launch so many times - eight between the two.

'He's been a trouper,' Mark said. 

Since the men left for space, Mark had a chance to speak with the astronauts once they got to the International Space Station. 

In a Tweet he wrote, 'Got to talk to @StationCDRKelly & crewmates after they made it safely aboard the Space Station. Doing well so far!'
