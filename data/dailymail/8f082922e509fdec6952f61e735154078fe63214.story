Jimmy Savile sexually abused four children when they were just five-years-old, three more than police previously claimed.

The new horror was revealed in the Sunday Telegraph as it emerged five more celebrities are being probed as part of Operation Yewtree.

Savile preyed on the youngsters between 1962 and 1976 in West Yorkshire, where he had a home. The revelations take his offending to a new level and also raise further questions over the conduct of West Yorkshire Police.

Expanding: Operation Yewtree detectives are investigating five new celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal

The force had consistently maintained the disgraced entertainer had only targeted one victim of that age and published its findings in a 59-page report last week.

But after repeated questioning, it yesterday admitted the document was 'slightly misleading' and admitted four victims were aged five.

The force said the two of the victims had come forward last December and two earlier this year.

But a previous joint report by the NSPCC and Scotland Yard, published on January 11, had previously said the youngest victim was eight.

The latest twist in the case came as police began following a flood new complaints by both men and women against two singers, two TV personalities and a comedian, according to the Daily Mirror.

Detectives from Operation Yewtree are now conducting fresh interviews across the country as the scale of the investigation grows ever larger. The new allegations are said to stretch back five decades.

It is believed more victims are now coming forward in the wake of coverage of Savile's disgusting crimes.

A source told the Mirror that Yewtree officers will 'leave no stone unturned' if people come forward with credible allegations.

So far 12 people have been arrested 
as part of the post-Savile inquiry, which is being run in three strands –
allegations against Savile, allegations involving Savile and others, 
and allegations involving others.

The
arrests include entertainers Rolf Harris, Freddie Starr and Jimmy 
Tarbuck and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter. All deny any wrongdoing.

Last month PR guru Max Clifford was charged with indecent assault 
against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrate's Court on May 28 and has vowed to clear his name.

Detectives have flown to Australia to interview a woman as part of the investigation into 83-year-old Harris. He has made no public statement on the arrest and has been bailed until a date in May.

Jim Davidson, 59, was bailed again yesterday over an alleged sex offence.

It emerged yesterday that Scotland Yard are also investigating claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falklands in the 1980s.

Davidson was originally 
arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. The revelation 
that the tentacles of Yewtree have now spread to the other side of the 
world is likely to prompt renewed claims that the force is conducting a 
celebrity witch-hunt.

Critics
claim the inquiry has become a runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, 
gather evidence later’ policy ruining the lives of celebrities. Yard 
chiefs insist it is ‘fair and proportionate’.

The Met investigation is being
carried out on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has 
only 16 full-time officers. This is because British Police have no 
jurisdiction in the Falklands, meaning they have no right to charge 
people over offences there.

A
file on the case will soon be sent to the Falklands’ Attorney General, 
Mark Lewis, who will consult lawyers before deciding whether Davidson 
should be prosecuted.

If
Mr Lewis authorises charges, the five-times married comic will be 
forced to travel 9,800 miles to the Falklands to stand trial. The 
authorities in the Falklands, a British overseas territory, have the 
power to ‘compel’ someone from the UK to appear in court in its capital,
Port Stanley. One official said that if Davidson were to be prosecuted 
in the Falklands, it would be the ‘biggest thing to happen there the 
since the war’.

It is understood the woman, who claims she was indecently assaulted by Davidson, is not a resident.

For legal reasons, the Mail cannot give details about her occupation at the time of the alleged attack.

She
first contacted officers on Operation Yewtree with her allegations. 
They in turn alerted police in the Falklands. A Falklands police 
spokesman told the Mail: ‘The Falkland Islands Government have been made
aware of allegations made against Jim Davidson.

‘We
have asked the Metropolitan Police to make enquiries relating to these 
allegations. We await the outcome of the investigation.’ It is 
understood Yewtree officers have not yet visited the Falklands in 
connection with Davidson. Sources said it was unclear who would pay for 
the Falklands strand of the Yewtree inquiry.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
