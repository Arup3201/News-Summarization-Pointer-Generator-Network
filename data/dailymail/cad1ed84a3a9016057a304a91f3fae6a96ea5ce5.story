Lyon President Jean-Michel Aulas believes the club's in-form striker Alexandre Lacazette is better than 'the Welshman at Real Madrid' Gareth Bale.

Lacazette has been in blistering form for Lyon this season and the 23-year-old's goals have fired the French club to the top of Ligue Un.

The France international scored a brace against Toulouse on Sunday to take his tally for the season to 22 in all competitions.

And president Aulas has described Lacazette as being a better player than Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale, and insisted there is no point talking about transfer fees for the striker.

'His Market value is priceless,' the Lyon president told Le Parisien.

'What is the name of that Welshman at Real Madrid? I think Alexandre is much better than him.

'There is no point in discussing any transfer fees.'

Lacazette's performances have not gone unnoticed and Lyon's prized asset has been linked with a number of top European clubs, including Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City.

The Etihad side sent scouts to watch Lacazette during Lyon's recent French League Cup victory against Lens. The Frenchman netted from the penalty spot to help his side to a 3-2 win.

In December Lyon manager Hubert Fournier said that Lacazette was happy to remain in France and was not agitating for a January move.
