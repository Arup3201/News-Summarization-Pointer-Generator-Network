Check please: Anthony Malabehar has been jailed for three years after refusing to pay his restaurant bill

A diner who refused to pay for his meal at a Charleston steak house will now eat for free for three years, after being sent to prison.

Anthony M Malabehar ran up a $70 bill at the Alamo Steak House in Mattoon, after enjoying a meal on April 4 and then refusing to pay.

The 47-year-old had pleaded guilty earlier in the year to not paying for a meal at a different restaurant.

Malabehar, who enjoyed drinks, an appetizer and entree at the steakhouse, told staff he could not pay and, according to the Journal Gazette & Times-Courier, just waited for police to arrest him.

In February, Malabehar refused to pay for his dinner at the Hunan Chinese restaurant in Mattoon. 

Because of this, and other theft convictions, he was sentenced to three years, and ordered to pay a $100 fine and reimburse the Alamo Steakhouse for his meal.

Assistant stateâ€™s attorney Rob Scales said Malabehar refused to explain why he stole from the restaurants. In both cases he told restaurant workers that he couldnâ€™t pay.

A charge that Malabehar had gone to the restaurant with the intention to steal, which carried a maximum sentence of 14 years, was dismissed by the court.

Tall order: Anthony Malabehar enjoyed meals at Alamo and Hunan in Mattoon, then refused to pay

As Malabehar settles into life as a prisoner he will be able to dine without paying on a daily basis.

Prisoners in Illinois have a choice of eating for free in the prison canteen, or buying pricey food from the prison shop.

However, recent cutbacks in prisons have led to complaints about the quality and portion size in some U.S. prisons.
