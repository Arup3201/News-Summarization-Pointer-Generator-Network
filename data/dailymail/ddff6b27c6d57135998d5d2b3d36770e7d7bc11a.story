San Diego police say a 40-year-old man died after a border inspector shot him with a stun gun at the nation's busiest crossing.

Police said Thursday that the man jumped over a counter and attacked an inspector after being escorted to a separate area for questioning at the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.

The man used a pedestrian crossing at the port of entry at around 7pm and during secondary inspections, agents realized the man was wanted on a felony charge, NBC reports.

When authorities tried to take him into custody, the man attacked.

'The male would not comply with the agents’ instructions and had concealed his hands from the view of the agents,' said homicide Lt. Paul Rorrison, according to Patch.  

Officials say they used a Taser to control the man, who is only being identified as a 40-year-old male, but soon noticed the man had stopped breathing and was unresponsive.  

Authorities attempted CPR on the man and called for paramedics. 

Hospital: The man was taken to the Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center in San Diego where he was pronounced dead
