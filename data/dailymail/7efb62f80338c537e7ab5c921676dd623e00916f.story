As a boy growing up in the shadow of a shipyard in Wallsend, Sting would watch majestic vessels being built, and being launched into the river to set sail to far-off, exotic destinations.

This month he was welcomed on board one of the world's most revered cruise liners Queen Mary 2 in New York as a one of the most celebrated headliners to ever perform in the ship's Royal Court Theatre.

The 16-time Grammy Award-winning musician honoured the community in which he was raised by performing songs from his musical The Last Ship, which arrived in New York last week from a debut run in Chicago.

'I was born and raised in Wallsend in the shadow of the Swan Hunter shipyard,' the 63-year-old said. 'My earliest memories are of ships being built and launched into the river.

'You couldn’t escape Swan Hunter – there was a coal mine at one end of town and Swan Hunter at the other, so these ships loomed over our houses. 

'With The Last Ship, I thought I would try and honour the community that I came from. Because everyone around me worked in the shipyard. My grandfather worked in the shipyard. All his brothers worked in the shipyard. My family has had things to do with the sea for many years.'

Over the years, 15 of Cunard Line's ships were built in the Tyneside shipyard, including Mauretania and Carpathia. For this reason, Sting chose the Queen Mary 2 to perform his set, which included songs from the musical as well as tracks such as ‘An Englishman in New York’.

The superstar will also team up with Cunard again to perform songs from The Last Ship in the UK at two sold-out benefit shows at the Sage Theatre Gateshead. 

'It’s only right and fitting to take this story back in some form to the people who inspired it, so I’m really happy to do that,' he said.

Stage debut: Sting's new musical The Last Ship arrived on Broadway from a preview run in Chicago

Premiere: The Grammy winner and wife Trudie attended a star-studded premiere performance last week

The Last Ship had its pre-Broadway premiere at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago over the summer for a short 33-day run. 

Last week, it made its glittering debut on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre, with stars including Robert de Niro, Liam Neeson, and Billy Joel turning out to support Sting. 

The musical charts the course of Gideon Fletcher, a shipbuilder's son who leaves his girlfriend, Meg Dawson, and his hometown of Wallsend in search of a better life. He returns 15 years later after his father's death to a town hit by recession, where the shipyard has closed and his lover has moved on.
