Travellers are finally fleeing the infamous Dale Farm site they fought for more than a decade to defend as they say the former greenbelt site is contaminated with raw sewage.

Dale Farm residents had fought a 10-year legal battle with Basildon Council in Essex to defend their right to live illegally on the six-acre site in Crays Hill, Essex.

Hundreds of police and bailiffs were mobilised in October 2011 as part of a £7.1million eviction but despite the costly action a large number of touring caravans continued to line the road leading into the site.

'Filthy': A line of caravans parked along an access road near the Dale Farm camp, which has allegedly become rat-infested and covered in excrement

Action: Travellers and protesters manoeuvre a caravan to block a road during the eviction of Dale Farm last year, as residents complain about conditions there

It is alleged families have no access to toilets which has resulted 
in the site becoming infested with rats and covered with human 
excrement.

Illnesses such as
impetigo, chickenpox and diarrhoea are rife and children have been 
struck by bouts of vomiting since the £7.2million eviction operation 12 
months ago, an NHS report said last year.

But now travellers are exiting in their droves after suffering health problems due to their poor living conditions.

Stuart Hardwicke-Carruthers, a campaigner for the travellers, said: 'Most of them have left.

'The conditions left by the council after the eviction, with raw sewage still leaking, has led to a lot of illness.

'Some have gone to Birmingham and others to Ireland to stay with family.

'They will be coming back though because they can’t stay there indefinitely.'

Row: Dale Farm has been at the heart of a decade-long battle between Basildon Council and travellers

Travellers who had continued to live illegally on the roadside had previously complained of a lack of electricity, running water and toilet facilities.

The complaints came despite enforcement notices from the council last July demanding they leave the roadside immediately.

The enforcement notices prompted failed appeals to the Planning Inspectorate and High Court although legal action is still believed to be on-going despite the exodus from the site.

Refusal: Despite costing the taxpayer £7.1m, people have not all left the area

Councillor Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council, said: 'The travellers have asked for their application to be heard in open court by another judge.

'We will not take action until the outcome of that.'

An Environment Agency report into dangerous contaminants - including asbestos and engine oil - at Dale Farm is expected to be published in the coming months.
