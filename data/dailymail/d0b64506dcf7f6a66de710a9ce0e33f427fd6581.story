A collection of images taken on board the International Space Station has been compiled into a time-lapse video depicting earth from space over five-and-a-half months. 

Astronauts spent 165 days in orbit before returning to earth last month, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan. 

Among them was Alexander Gerst, a German member of the European Space Agency, who fitted cameras all over the spacecraft to capture earth in all its splendour. 

Once back on earth the 38-year-old compiled 12,500 of the images to offer a stunning glimpse of the planet from afar. 

Between picturesque photographs of gaping oceans and cloud forming over land are some more poignant, including a snapshot of the conflict between Israeli and Palestinian fighters battling over Gaza. 

Amber rockets flare above the city in the image which Gerst described as 'the saddest photo yet' in a Twitter post in July.
