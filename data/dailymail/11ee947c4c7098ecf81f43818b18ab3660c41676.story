Toyota puts tough men to the test through their strengths and paces at the Hilux Driver Test Facility, in the latest advertisement for the Toyota Hilux.

Toyota puts tough men to the limit by testing their strengths - physically and mentally

In the latest advertisement for the Toyota Hilux, men had to sit through the spider challenge

The ad shows hard-working men battling through the challenges both physically and mentally 'in all conditions' that the 'Hilux could throw' at them.

Unbreakable drivers were put to the limit where they had to walk across hot coals, get slapped across with slab of woods, spanners thrown at them and getting electrocuted during the farm test.

Not only were they tested on their strengths, but the men had to also face their fears.

'Some of my mates didn't make it,' the ad goes.

One man is given an extremely hot meat pie and he starts blowing on it to cool it down before he could eat it but fails when he gets the head shake from the examiner

Men were challenged in all conditions - through mentally and physically

One scene shows a man screaming in fear as he jumps out of the ute and rolls on the ground while spiders are seen falling off the man and onto the ground.

'And others prove their worth.'

The next scene shows a man looking rather alarmed but calm as he sits still inside the car while the spiders were crawling all over his face.

In another scene, another man is given an extremely hot meat pie and he starts blowing on it to cool down before he could eat it but fails the test when he gets the head shake from the examiner.

'Not everyone can own a Hilux,' the ad continues.

In the last scene, the men who have passed the test are congratulated as they line up to collect their keys but one man started crying in relief before he gets them taken back.

'So when they handed me the keys - it was overwhelming. I'll get my Hilux one day though,' the ad said.

In the last scene, the men who passed all the challenges are congratulated with the keys 

Executive Creative Director of Saatchi & Saatchi Mike Spirkovski told Campaign Brief: 'For decades Hilux has firmly held the flag for being 'unbreakable' and is seen as the pinnacle by many of the hardest-working blokes across the country.

'We simply wanted to highlight that our Unbreakable Hilux deserves an equally unbreakable driver. Nothing less,' he said.
