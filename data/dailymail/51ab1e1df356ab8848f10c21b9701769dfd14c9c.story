A  woman travelling with an eight-year-old girl has been arrested at Heathrow over alleged conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation (FGM).

Scotland Yard said the 42-year-old woman was arrested by police officers carrying out an FGM awareness operation alongside officers from the UK Border Force.

The woman, who has not been named, is a British national born in Zimbabwe and was arrested at around 12.15pm this afternoon shortly before she was due to board a flight to Ghana via Amsterdam. 

The arrest comes two days after an NHS doctor was cleared of performing an FGM procedure on a young mother at a London hospital.

She was taken to a west London police station and subsequently transferred to Northamptonshire Police who are investigating the matter.

The eight-year-old girl travelling with the woman was taken into the care of social services. 

Today's arrest coincided with 'International Day of Zero Tolerance of FGM' and officers from the Metropolitan Police were carrying out a proactive operation at the country's largest airport to raise awareness of the issue.

In collaboration with UKBF, specialist officers from the Met's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command have been working at Heathrow, carrying out preventative and detection work in relation to both inbound and outbound flights to 'countries of prevalence' for FGM.

Officers from Project Azure, the MP's response to tackling FGM, and SO18 Aviation Command have been carrying out a combination of educational and enforcement activities, including preventative work with passengers on outbound flights to 'countries of prevalence', intelligence-led checks on passengers and searches of baggage, engagement with passengers from communities affected by this crime and identifying possible offences in order to take action against those responsible.

Scotland Yard said a number of passengers on a flight from Kenya earlier this morning were spoken to, and while no offences were identified, individuals were given guidance about the risks involved with FGM.

Passengers travelling to destinations including Ghana, Doha and Abu Dhabi were also spoken to by officers at the airport.

DCI Jane Scotchbrook from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: 'Today's activity is one aspect of our continued efforts to raise awareness of this form of child abuse, its associated immediate and long term health risks, and the absence of any religious teaching that supports its undertaking.

'Our focus is on targeting those communities where offences of FGM are prevalent, by engaging with passengers travelling to and from countries where the offence is practised. 

We hope to educate and prevent anyone who may engage in FGM, as well as highlighting the support available to those who may be at risk.'  

Today's arrest came just two days after a doctor was cleared of performing FGM. 

Dhanuson Dharmasena, aged 32, was accused of carrying out the illegal procedure when stitching the woman after she gave birth at the Whittington Hospital, north London, in 2012.

However, a jury took less than 30 minutes to acquit the doctor, of Ilford, north-east London, who was alleged to have effectively redone the FGM carried out on the woman as a six year-old in Somalia.

The two-week trial at Southwark Crown Court marked the first prosecution of its kind in the UK.

A second man, Hasan Mohamed, aged 41, of Holloway, north London, was cleared of aiding and abetting him.

Young victims of FGM are often taken abroad during the school holidays, with the wounds healing before they return to the UK.

The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman in the community, who often has no medical training. 

Often, anaesthetics and antiseptics are not used and the cutting usually takes place with basic tools including knives, scissors and even razor blades. 

The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK. 

Those who are involved in any way - be it aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or carrying out FGM inside or outside the UK can face 14 years imprisonment.
