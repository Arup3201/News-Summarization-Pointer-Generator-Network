A 23-year-old man forgot he was a criminal after hitting his head in a car crash - and has now turned his life around, his lawyer has claimed. 

Christian Eshenbaugh stole around 2,000 aluminum tire rims, worth more than $33,000, from a salvage yard in Pittsburgh, western Pennsylvania, over a two-month period in 2013.

But later that year, he suffered traumatic brain injuries when the car he was traveling in smashed into a tree on Warrandale Road, killing the driver. He spent months undergoing rehabilitation.

In a Butler County court on Wednesday, Eshenbaugh's attorney, Stephen Misko, claimed his client has become a 'completely different person' as he struggles to regain his memory and motor skills.

He said the criminal could not recall his offense, has 'turned his life 180 degrees' and no longer has a penchant for petty crimes fueled by drug use, according to the Butler Eagle. 

Eshenbaugh was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to stealing a total of 2,057 tire rims, around 20 to 30 at a time, from Marshall's Junk Yard on Browns Hill Road in June 2013.

During the car crash, which occurred just months after the theft, Eshenbaugh was a passenger in a vehicle. He suffered a huge blow to the head, causing serious injuries, when the car hit a tree.

He was rushed to hospital, where he underwent several weeks of treatment, before being transferred to a rehabilitation facility. His friend, who was driving the car, reportedly died at the scene. 

Before the crash, Eshenbaugh had carried out a number of petty crimes related to drug use, the court heard. He was charged with disorderly conduct in the tire theft case.

In addition to a year's probation, the criminal was ordered to pay a sum of restitution.

The amount he has to pay will be determined later.
