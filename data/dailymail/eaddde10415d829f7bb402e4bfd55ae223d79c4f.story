A BBC interviewee who was arrested after appearing on Newsnight to talk about one of the Woolwich suspects has been charged with three terror offences.

Abu Nusaybah gave an interview to the BBC claiming Michael Adebolajo had been offered a job by MI5.

The 31-year-old was arrested after the recording and has been charged with three counts under the Terrorism Act.

These are not linked to the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Abu Nusaybah, who was arrested after appeaing on Newsnight, has been charged with three terrorist offences

The charges that Nusaybah, also known as Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, is facing are:

During the BBC interview Nusaynah claimed MI5 started following Adebolajo after a trip to Kenya last year.

He said the murder suspect believed MI5 was bugging him and 'knocking on his door' asking for information on 'certain individuals'.

Speaking about Abebolajo's MI5 claims, said : 'His wording was, "They are bugging me - they won't leave me alone."

Nusaybah was interviewed on the BBC's Newsnight about Woolwich suspect Michael Adebolajo

'He mentioned initially they wanted to ask him if he knew certain individuals.

'But after him saying that he didn't 
know these individuals, what he said was they asked him if he would be 
interested in working for them.

'He was explicit in that he refused to work for them but he did confirm he didn't know the individuals.'

Nusaybah also said he thought Adebolajo had undergone a 'change' following his detention by security forces on the trip.

He said Adebolajo suggested he had 
been physically and sexually abused while he was interrogated in the 
African country, and after this he became withdrawn and 'less talkative -
he wasn't his usual bubbly self.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
