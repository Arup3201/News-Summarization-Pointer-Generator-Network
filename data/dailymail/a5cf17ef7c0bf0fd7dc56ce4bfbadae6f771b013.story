Keith Baldock has been banned from the roads after clocking up 54 points on his driving licence

A driver who was allowed to stay on the roads despite clocking up 54 penalty points has finally been banned by a judge who admitted he has been 'lucky'.

Keith Baldock was believed to be the only driver in the UK to be 'legally' on the road despite having more than 50 penalty points on his licence.

The legal limit is 12 points, but a series of court mistakes allowed the 34-year-old, who lost his job as a tyre fitter two years ago, to keep driving.

The father-of-two, of Westgate-on-Sea in Kent, has a string of offences to his name, including a one-year ban in 2010 for driving over the limit and and a 12-month supervision order for admitting stealing petrol worth £500 from a string of garages last year.

In November last year, Baldock was handed 30 points - six points for five separate offences - after being convicted of driving a car with no insurance and stealing fuel.

Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl, however, was unaware at the time of the previous 24 points already on his licence and Baldock was allowed to keep driving after convincing the judge he needed a car to find a job.

But yesterday he was finally banned from the roads for three years after appearing at Canterbury Crown Court in front of the same judge.

The judge 're-opened sentencing options' on the case and banned Baldock from the road for three years - as well as jailing him for 18 months after he admitted breaching a suspended sentence and possession of a knife.

At the hearing in November, the court heard how Baldock was caught five times driving without insurance on July 14, July 20, August 3, August 10, and August 28 last year - charges he admitted.

He also admitted filling up with 
petrol in garages on four occasions - July 14, July 20, August 3, August
 10 - and speeding off without paying, stealing fuel worth £483.

He
 was given a 12-month supervision order, put under curfew between 7pm 
and 7am and ordered to repay the £483 to the garages he stole petrol 
from.

The court heard how 
Baldock was arrested in February this year for breaching his supervision
 order and curfew after being caught with a knife during a spat with a 
man at a caravan park.

The judge took the opportunity to ban him from the roads.

Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl told the court that Baldock had a 'head in the sand mentality' and that he 'hoped the court order (against him) would be forgotten about'.

In February this year, prosecutors tried and failed to get Baldock banned after it was found that Baldock already had 24 points on his licence before his appearance in court in November last year.

But because the law states any variation in 'the substance of a sentence' must be made within 56 days, it was 'too late' to change the sentence he received at the time.

Prosecutor Francis Lloyd told Canterbury Crown Court in February: 'At the earlier hearing he was not disqualified, but in fact he should have been unless there was exceptional hardship.

'Unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now - he's a lucky fellow.'

Judge Van Der Bijl replied: 'A lucky man indeed. Case closed.'
