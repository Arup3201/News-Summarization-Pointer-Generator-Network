There was a time when politicians would climb on to a soapbox to address voters, before they found comfort on the breakfast TV sofa.

Now the battle for swing voters has moved to the Loose Women panel, with the three main parties sending high-flying female MPs onto the ITV show.

It comes as polls show more than a third of women are yet to decide who to vote for on May 7.

Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson, Tory minister Esther McVey and Labour frontbencher Gloria de Piero will all join the Loose Women panel in the run-up to the election

Every party has prioritised wooing female voters, with around half of women believing politicians do not understand what life is like for them.

Now senior politicians are to go into the lion’s den of the Loose Women studios in the days before the election.

Tory employment minister Esther McVey and Labour’s shadow women’s minister Gloria de Piero, both former TV presenters, will appear on the show.

Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson will complete the line-up of politicians targeting daytime viewers.

Editor of Loose Women Martin Frizell said: “Loose Women is the first show to start the election campaign. Three of the youngest and most prolific female politicians will explain how they are making their mark and how they are working to feature in the future government.”

They will appear with the regular line-up of straight-talking panel members including Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jamelia and Janet Street Porter.

Miss de Piero, who worked on GMTV before entering politics, told MailOnline: ‘Labour has some great policies for women and families and it will be great to be grilled about them by Ruth, Coleen, Jamelia and Janet.

‘The election won't be won by people who inhabit the bubble of Westminster so I'm looking forward to getting out of that bubble as much as possible and Loose Women will be a great place to do just that.’

Miss McVey, who was once a GMTV presenter, will appear on Wednesday February 18 while Miss de Piero will join the panel on Tuesday March 3. Miss Swimson will be on the show on Tuesday March 17. 

A poll this week showed women voters have put the NHS, living costs and family care pressures as their top concerns for the general election.

Some 59 per cent of women said they were concerned about the NHS, while 40 per cent of women identified living costs as a major issue and 30 per cent picked the cost of caring for their family - all of which were lower down on the list of priorities for male voters.

The findings will provide a boost for Labour, which has put the health service and what it calls the cost of living crisis at the heart of its campaigning.

According to the research by TNS for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, 31 per cent of men were concerned about the economy, including the deficit and unemployment, compared to just 21 per cent of women.

The polling found 48 per cent of women felt that none of the leaders - David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood - understands what life is like for them and their families, compared with 41 per cent of men.

When it comes to the two major party leaders, just 10 per cent of women believe that the Prime Minister best understands their daily lives, while 12 per cent of women said the same about Mr Miliband.

While that finding may not make particularly welcome reading for those currently at the helm of Britain's parties, the findings are likely to be better received by Theresa May.

It found that 44 per cent of voters overall believed the Home Secretary would perform well as leader of the Conservative Party. Labour counterpart Yvette Cooper was backed by 38 per cent of voters.
