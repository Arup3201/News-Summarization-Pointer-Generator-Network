The spirit of Christmas is thriving in one part of Britain after an act of kindness to a family snowballed with others rushing to follow suit.

Karl Bennett caused a giveaway stampede after posting an offer of a week's free holiday to a lucky family in his caravan in Kingsbridge, Devon to a Facebook group.

He posted to the 'Free stuff in Plymouth' page offering a getaway in spring as a Christmas present.

Karl Bennett started the frenzy by offering a free week's holiday in his luxury caravan near Plymouth

Since then, a large group of people have offered other gifts and services including this attractive cake

One family has offered these baby toys which will be sure to bring some job on Christmas morning 

Danna Kemp, who has two autistic sons aged 10 and 12 and a daughter aged 20, said that she contacted Mr Bennett about the caravan holiday.

She said: ''Karl is away at the moment but I sent him a private message when he offered the holiday to ask him what dates he had available and costs as I have two autistic sons and thought it would be good as if it's too much for them, we could come home.

The 42-year-old mother of three said the holiday was especially welcome as her husband is awaiting brain surgery. 

She added: 'I was stunned and cried when I read his reply.

'He told me I could have 10 days in April for free to just have fun.'

Since then the Facebook page has been inundated with offers of free Christmas gifts including a gym membership, hair cuts, a photo session with a professional photographer, a pony ride and even a cooked Christmas dinner.

Since Mr Bennett's generous offer, there have been a wide range of other gifts offered by the Facebook users

Caprice Vogler has run the group in Plymouth for the past two years and is stunned by the response 

Capricia Vogler, who was an administrator of the group for almost two years, said that people have been giving away their unwanted items on the page for years.

She said: 'It's absolutely amazing. 

Ms Vogler, 32, from Devonport, Plymouth, said: 'As soon as Karl posted up his gift everyone started to get into the spirit of things because it was such a big gift.

'Even people who haven't got much have gone out their way to give things away.

'This is the first time it's happened for Christmas and it's gone completely mental.'

The group has almost 9,000 members and scores of individuals and businesses have come together to generously donate gifts in the Christmas spirit.

Vicky Nicholls, who is also a member of the group, said that she noticed Mr Bennett's post a while ago but that the offers really started flooding through over the past couple of days.

Several items of jewellery such as this bracelet, left and watch set, right, are being donated for Christmas

The 30-year-old beauty therapist said: ''I noticed the first post about a week ago but what's happened in the last 24 hours has really snowballed.

'It's quite endearing to see it at this time of year when everyone's struggling and is a bit negative.

'It's just all about providing for your family and one act of kindness has encouraged people to do the same.'

Other generous people have also helped with the season of goodwill, with Codie Murphy of the Fusion Creative hair salon offering a free wash, cut and blow dry. 

Suzanne Hubble, from Energie Fitness for Women, in Plympton, has offered a four-week gym membership.

Robyn Dylan, a professional photographer, has offered a free photo session.

Kezzy Cakes are offering a free Christmas fruit cake.

Amy Hellyer is offering a ride on her daughter's pony for children aged three to eight.

Lindsay Donald is offering a £15 Tesco gift card.
