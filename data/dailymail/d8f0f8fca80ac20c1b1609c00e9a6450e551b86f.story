British spies failed to track the jihadi killers of soldier Lee Rigby – after MI5 decided they did not pose enough of a danger, an official report into the terror attack is set to reveal.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, was run over and then butchered by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale  last year outside Woolwich barracks in south-east London.

Both men were known to MI5 – especially Adebolajo, 29, who was arrested in Kenya in 2010 attempting to cross the border into Somalia to fight for the African terror group Al Shabaab. He was passed to British spies.

In the months leading up the brutal murder in May last year, the killer was also posting extremist material on the internet.

Despite their history of extremism MI5 assessed the pair as not posing a sufficient danger to require full monitoring.

In a long-awaited report set to be published tomorrow Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee will insist that MI5 cannot be blamed for failing to track the pair.

It will claim that the domestic security organisation was unaware of the extremist material they were posting on the interest which could have alerted them to the fanatical intentions of the killers.

Internet service providers – who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services – did not alert them it was there.

Tomorrow’s bombshell report will be presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister.

Both men were sentenced in February to life imprisonment for the soldier’s murder, with leader Adebolajo told he would never be released.

No individual will be criticised in the report into the security services’ handling of the case and that MI5 itself will not be blamed for failing to stop the attack, according to a report by the Guardian today.

Adebolajo has claimed spies attempted to turn him into an informant after he was arrested in Kenya in 2010.

The report to be released on Tuesday runs to more than 100 pages, but the full report has already gone to the prime minister.

The committee used its powers to read MI5 files about Adebolajo and Adebowale as well as to interview MI5 head Andrew Parker.

After Drummer Rigby’s murder, several witnesses said Adebolajo had complained of his treatment by the security services, the Guardian has claimed.

Adebolajo and Adebowale, both converts to Islam, had been known to the security services for up to eight years before the attack.

Adebolajo went to Kenya in 2010, where he was arrested as he attempted to join extremists in Somalia.
