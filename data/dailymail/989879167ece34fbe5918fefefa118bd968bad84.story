Barack Obama told voters in a bullish speech as he today stormed into the final day of campaigning before Election Day in the US: 'I may be full of grey hair now, but I’m just as motivated as I was four years ago. We’ve come too far to turn back. I’m not tired. I’m not weary.’

Ahead of tomorrow’s big day, the President and his Republican rival Mitt Romney once again visited the country’s toughest battleground state in Ohio, which has picked the winner of the last 12 elections. It came as Mr Romney pulled ahead of President Obama in the key Rasmussen daily tracking poll.

It gave the Republican a one-point lead by 49 to 48 per cent. The same survey had them tied yesterday. Mr Romney was also given a two-point lead in Virginia, Florida and Ohio - but a national poll of more than 36,000 voters in 27 states said the President will win re-election by two percentage points.

The two contenders are locked
in one of the closest presidential races in recent U.S. history, but a 
majority of surveys in the battleground states show President Obama with
a slight advantage. That gives him an easier path to the 270 electoral 
votes needed for victory.

No Republican has won without Ohio, 
and Mr Romney could still make a late visit there on Election Day. The 
winner is not determined by the nationwide popular vote but in 
state-by-state contests, making nine ‘battleground’ states that don't 
consistently vote either way very important in such a tight race.

Winning a state gives Mr Romney or 
President Obama that state's electoral votes, which are apportioned to 
states based on a mix of population and representation in Congress.

There is a chance of a replay of 
2000, when Republican George W. Bush won the presidency with an 
electoral vote majority while Democrat Al Gore had a narrow lead in the 
nationwide popular vote.

Both President Obama and Mr Romney say
this year's winner will be determined by who can get the most 
supporters to the polls. ‘This is going to be a turnout election,’ the 
President said today.

'I may be full of grey hair now, but I’m just as motivated as I was four years ago. We’ve come too far to turn back. I’m not tired. I’m not weary'

President Barack Obama

President Obama’s campaign knows that 
the feeling of making history by electing America's first black 
president that fired up the 2008 campaign has cooled. Rock legend Bruce 
Springsteen and rapper Jay-Z were joining Obama for Ohio events today.  

‘We have one job left,’ and that's 
getting people out to vote, Mr Romney told a Florida crowd this morning.
The crowd chanted, ‘One more day!’

Mr Romney, who described himself as 
‘severely conservative’ during the GOP primary campaign, is now 
appealing to the centre and highlighting his ‘bipartisan record’ as 
Massachusetts governor.

He continues to insist that his 
experience as a businessman would help fix the still-weak U.S. economy -
a top issue with voters. President Obama meanwhile has come back from a
weak performance in his first of three debates with Mr Romney last 
month and hammered at his rival’s shifting positions.

'One more day!'

Crowd's chant at Mitt Romney event in Florida

The final national NBC/Wall Street 
Journal Poll, released yesterday, showed President Obama with the 
support of 48 per cent of likely voters, with Mr Romney receiving 47 per
cent.

The final national poll from the Pew 
Research Center found President Obama with a three-point edge over Mr 
Romney of 48 per cent to 45 per cent.

This was an improved showing that 
indicates the President may have benefited from his handling of the 
response to last week's Superstorm Sandy. He suspended three full days 
of campaigning to deal with the East Coast disaster.

If the election were held now, an AP 
analysis found President Obama would be all but assured of 249 electoral
votes by carrying 20 states that are solidly Democratic or leaning his 
way and the District of Columbia.

Mr Romney would lay claim to 206, from
probable victories in 24 states that are strong Republican ground or 
tilt toward the Republicans.

Up for grabs are 83 electoral votes spread across Colorado, Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Of those, Republicans and Democrats 
alike say President Obama seems in slightly better shape than Mr Romney 
in Ohio and Wisconsin, while Mr Romney appears to be performing slightly
better than President Obama or has pulled even in Virginia and Florida.

With President Obama sustaining his 
lead in Ohio, Mr Romney has made a surprise, last-minute move in 
neighbouring Pennsylvania.

The state has voted Democratic in the last 
five presidential elections and has long been counted in the President 
Obama column.

Mr Romney made his first visit of the 
autumn campaign yesterday.

The theme from the movie ‘Rocky’ blared from 
the loudspeakers as he stepped to the podium in a Philadelphia suburb.

‘The people of America understand 
we're taking back the White House because we're going to win 
Pennsylvania,’ Mr Romney told a large crowd on a cold night.

President Obama's campaign said Mr 
Romney's move in Pennsylvania showed the Republican's desperation over 
his diminished chances in Ohio.

And the Obama campaign announced that 
former President Bill Clinton - President Obama's most powerful 
surrogate - would make four campaign stops in Pennsylvania today.

About 30million people have already 
cast ballots in 34 states and the District of Columbia, although none 
will be counted until Election Day.

Storm-hit New York and New Jersey 
hurried to make voting accessible in a region where more than 1million 
remain without power. But the states are seen by both campaigns to be 
heavily in favour of the President.
