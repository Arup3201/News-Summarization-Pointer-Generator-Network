Resignation: Assistant prosecutor John Quarenghi quit his job to save his office from embarrassment

A top county prosecutor in Missouri has resigned after a federal investigation into a 26-year-old paralegal turned up intimate photos, texts and voicemails they had exchanged.

John Quarenghi, 48, an assistant prosecutor in St Louis County's Prosecuting Attorney's Office, stepped down in December to save his office from embarrassment after the messages came to light.

They emerged during an investigation into Jillian Nichols, a paralegal who allegedly told an accused sex offender that she could get favoritism from an assistant prosecutor for $10,000.

Authorities will not say if Quarenghi was the prosecutor she was referring to, but he regularly works on sex offender cases and had been on several dates with Nichols by that point.

U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan would not say whether Nichols had been referring to Quarenghi but emphasized that the prosecutor in question had absolutely no part in her alleged bribery scheme, the Salt Lake Post-Dispatch reported.

Neil Bruntrager, Quarenghi's attorney, added: 'Obviously, we know he never did anything wrong. Either illegal or unethical. Obviously, he had no idea what her intentions were.'

The investigation into Nichols came after
 she allegedly offered one of her firm's client's a better deal - 
'something like probation' - if he handed over $10,000, according to an 
indictment.

The client, 19-year-old Ziyaa Umarov, was
 charged with sexual assault in 2012 - and Quarenghi was the prosecutor 
on his case until recently. Nichols later left the firm representing 
Umarov.

Nichols was unaware that Umarov was 
actually working with federal investigators in a sting operation. When 
she was questioned by the FBI, she allegedly lied about her deal.

Quarenghi, who is single, began having contact with Nichols after learning she no longer worked for Umarovâ€™s lawyer.

She had emailed him and the pair had lunch and two or three happy-hour dates, his lawyer said.

The prosecutor believed that their relationship was 'maturing' and, after she initiated it, he sent her intimate texts and photographs.

But the relationship ended at the end of November, when Nichols knocked back his offers to cook for her.

Nichols pleaded not guilty of charges of wire fraud and lying to the FBI on Monday.

Neil Bruntrager, Quarenghi's attorney,
 said the prosecutor's bosses told him about the federal investigation 
on December 13 and he resigned 10 days later. He has now secured another
 job.

Bruntrager said 
Quarenghi was told that he was not a target or subject of the 
investigation - simply that his messages had been discovered during a 
probe into Nichols.
