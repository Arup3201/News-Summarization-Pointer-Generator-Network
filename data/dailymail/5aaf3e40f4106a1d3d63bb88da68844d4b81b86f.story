Chelsea Clinton appears to have found herself an unexpected pregnancy style icon – reality star Kim Kardashian.

Ms Clinton went for towering peep-toe Louboutins and wet-look leather trousers as she appeared alongside her mother Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Wildlife Conservation Society gala on Thursday night.

The mother-to-be’s choice of outfit was eerily similar to the style tabloid favourite Kim stuck to throughout her pregnancy last year.

Mother and daughter Clinton were honoured for their Clinton Foundation efforts to save African elephants from poaching at the event last night.

The Gala 2014: An Elephant’s Tale was held at the Central Park Zoo, Manhattan, on Thursday night.

Also in attendance was Chelsea's father and Hillary's husband, former president Bill Clinton, who turned up to support his two leading ladies.

Both Chelsea and her mother took to the stage at the gala event to speak of their work to aid the conservation of wild elephants.

While the former U.S. Secretary of State opted for green satin, Chelsea attended in an all-black leather-and-Louboutin outfit which reminisced of a pregnant Kim.

Kardashian, famous for having cameras follow intimate situations in her family home, gave birth to her daughter by rapper Kanye ‘I am the next Nelson Mandela’ West in June last year.

However, Kim and Chelsea are not the only ones opting for leather during their pregnancy. Celebrities like singer Fergie, socialite Tamara Ecclestone and Gwen Stefani have all been seen in leather trousers.

Later on Thursday night, an interview with Mrs Clinton aired in the UK where she took sides in the debate of Scottish independence.

Mrs Clinton - the leading candidate to succeed President Barack Obama in 2016 - declared she would 'hate' for Britain to 'lose Scotland'.

The former First Lady' said she believes a yes vote would be a 'loss for both sides' and she is hoping that it does not happen.

Her intervention on BBC2's Newsnight comes just a week after the President sparked anger among Scottish nationalists after intervening against independence.

Mrs Clinton, who is on a tour to promote her memoir Hard Choices and is widely believed to be preparing for a presidential run in 2016, also indicated she was keen for Britain to remain part of the European Union.
