A woman who fought and killed a hitman sent by her husband to murder her eight years ago has told how she is living in fear as her jailed ex's release date draws near.

Susan Walters has devised a 'run plan' to go into hiding if she feels threatened and has drawn up a will in case a second attempt on her life succeeds.

The terrified 59-year-old has also laid gravel around her house in order to hear the crunch of approaching footsteps and installed a new security system.

Living in fear: Susan Walters shows a picture of the hammer used by the  hitman at her husband's trial in 2007. He is to be released later this year after serving eight years in prison

In 2006, her estranged husband Michael Kuhnhausen agreed to pay crack addict Edward Haffey $50,000 to bludgeon her to death with a hammer and make it look like a burglary gone wrong. 

Haffey broke into Ms Walters's home in Portland, Oregon, and lay in wait for her to return. When she walked through the door he attacked her with the hammer, hitting her repeatedly around the head.

Threat? Ms Walters is terrified that her husband Michael Kuhnhausen, might organise another attempt on her life

But Ms Walters fought back, and in a desperate struggle that lasted an estimated 15 minutes she wrestled him to the ground and grabbed him round the throat.

She relaxed her grip demanding to know who had sent him, but when he tried to break free she choked him to death.

Notes found in Haffey's backpack linked him to Kuhnhausen, who was arrested and pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit aggravated murder.

In a plea deal he was sentenced to just 10 years in prison and that was reduced to eight on grounds of good behaviour, meaning he will walk free in September.

In 2008, Ms Walters sued Kuhnhausen, whom she had been married to for 17 years, for $1 million claiming emotional distress, saying she did not want him to have enough money to hire a hitman again.

Kuhnhausen, who will be 66 when he is released, insists he is not a threat and that he has terminal prostate cancer, meaning he would be too weak to exact any sort of revenge.

But that has only made Ms Walters more frightened because she beliecves that if he is terminally ill then he's 'not got a lot to lose.'

She told the Oregonian: 'It’s disturbing that he’s getting out, but I know I can’t keep him there.

'I’ve spent the last eight years hoping and praying he doesn’t have any hidden funds anywhere.

'I’m hoping he hasn’t found someone in prison who said, ‘You just hired the wrong guy.’

Ms Walters was awarded the Portland Police Bureau's Civilian Medal of Heroism, honoring her 'sheer determination' to survive.

Battered: Pictures produced at her husband's trial show the extent of Ms Walters's injuries. She fought a desperate battle with crack addict Edward Haffey which only ended when she choked him to death

Good behaviour: Michael Kuhnhausen is due to be released in September this year after serving just eight years for organising the hit

But she says she has been left traumatised and paranoid and breaks down in tears if forced to relive the terrible experience. 

She now hopes to persuade the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision to impose additional conditions on Kuhnhausen, banning him from entering the county where she is now living.

She added: 'I wish him peace, and I wish for him to live far away from me.'
