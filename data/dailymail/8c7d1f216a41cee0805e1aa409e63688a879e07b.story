Hawthorn AFL coach Alastair Clarkson has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome after he was admitted to hospital on Monday night with acute back pain.

The 46-year-old began receiving treatment last night for the rare disorder, an inflammation of the nerves from the spinal cord, and 'he has already shown a positive response'.

In a statement issued by the Hawks on Tuesday, assistant coach Brendon Bolton will take the reins in Clarkson's absence.

The coach is 'feeling good and in good spirits', according to tweets from Tuesday's press conference held by the club's CEO Stuart Fox and captain Luke Hodge.

The club was in shock with the news but as the condition has been detected early, they're confident that Clarkson will make a full recovery.

Although it is unknown how long he will be absent from his coaching duties, Clarkson is expected to remain in hospital for the next week.

'Our best option is to allow him to fully recover. Our first priority is to get his health right. Work isn't a priority,' Fox said.

The club were in shock when they were first informed but have been told by medical professionals that the 46-year-old is expected to make a full recovery

The father of three was appointed his first senior AFL coaching role at the Hawthorn Football Club in 2005

'There will definitely be a lot of support from the boys for him. We're here to support him.'

Hodge doesn’t expect Clarkson's absence will disrupt the Hawks' season.

Guillain-Barre syndrome syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements.

It causes the immune system to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement.

Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before.

Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have lasting problems.
