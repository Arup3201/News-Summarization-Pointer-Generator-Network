Shock: Frankie Dettori, pictured with his wife 
Catherine, faces a world ban after a failed drugs test

French authorities were 'tipped off' that Frankie Dettori – Britain's best-known jockey – had taken a banned substance, it emerged today.

The 41-year-old three-time champion jockey was shocked when officials demanded a drugs test and has been left devastated by the failure that is threatening to derail his career.

He faces a hearing before the medical committee of the French racing authorities next week after testing positive for cocaine or a derivative of it while riding Longchamp on September 16.

A well-placed racing source in Paris told the Evening Standard today that Dettori 'was taken by surprise by the test, following a tip-off from a third party'.

Dettori is currently in Dubai, where he has stopped off after riding in the Melbourne Cup on November 6.

Sources have told the Daily Mail the Italian has been ‘knocked for six’ by the positive test, which was ‘a moment of madness rather than a genuine addiction.’

Dettori’s withdrawal from his mounts at Doncaster on Saturday was unrelated to the imminent disciplinary hearing.

However, Coral has removed Dettori from its 2013 champion jockey betting with the threat of a long ban hanging over him.

Fellow jockey Kieran Fallon was handed a six-month ban by the France Galop in 2006 when he tested positive to cocaine for the first time.

A ban of such magnitude, which would not start until Dettori’s disciplinary process was completed, would potentially rule out Dettori until May or June of next year.

Coral spokesman David Stevens said: ‘If, as reports suggest, Frankie Dettori has failed a test involving cocaine, a six-month suspension is likely, and such a ban would rule him out of a title bid next year.’

The revelation has caused a sensation 
in the racing world. Dettori, famous for his exuberance and flying 
dismount, was awarded an MBE in 2000 and has become a major TV 
celebrity.

He was a one-time captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport and co-owner of a restaurant with chef Marco Pierre White.

In the dock: The 41-year-old tested positive for a 
prohibited substance following a meeting at Longchamp racecourse in 
Paris in September, where he took part in four races

A
three-time champion jockey, he has won more than 500 group races in his
career. But his exploits in the saddle achieved legendary status at 
Ascot in 1996, when he won all seven races in a row.

In an interview, Detorri said: 'I 
won the last race on Fujiyama Crest. I bought him when he retired and 
now he lives peacefully in my field.

'My wife Catherine made me a bronze 
cast of his foot – it reminds me of the wonderful horse that made me 
famous.'

Under reciprocal arrangements in place
between international racing authorities, any ban imposed in one 
country would apply internationally.

Dettori's solicitor, 
Christopher Stewart-Moore, said in a statement: 'I can confirm that, as a consequence 
of a positive test at Longchamp on September 16, he will be the subject 
of an inquiry by the Medical Committee of France Galop next week.

Rides: 3,422

Wins: 943

Strike rate: 28 per cent

Group One victories: 110 (262 victories at Listed level or higher)

Dubai World Cup wins: Three - Dubai Millennium (2000), Moon Ballad (2003) & Electrocutionist (206) 

He won 14 British Classics (nine riding for Godolphing)

On September 28, 1996, he partnered all seven winners on the card at Ascot

'In compliance with, and out of 
respect for, the regulations of France Galop he will not be commenting 
further until the France Galop procedures have been completed.'

Dettori and his wife, with whom he has five children, were not at their home near Newmarket, Suffolk, last night.

A relative who answered the door said:
'I don't know anything about it. Frankie is in Los Angeles and 
Catherine is in Hertfordshire with one of the children.'

The jockey parted company with racing stable Godolphin last month after an 18-year relationship.

Dettori was expected to continue 
working his contract until the end of this year but Godolphin said at 
the time that 'the retainer was not really working'. In 1993, Dettori 
received a caution for possession of cocaine after he had been to watch 
Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday play at Wembley in the FA Cup final.

Speaking about it in 2010, he said: 'That wasn't about losing weight. That was for fun.'

Describing how a 'fast' lifestyle took
over from his focus on horse racing when he began earning big money, he
added: 'Everyone wanted to be with me. I'd go clubbing, there was 
cocaine and there I was like the big show-off, the idiot.'

The jockey also had a professional DJ 
booth built in his home. He said: 'It started off as a bit of a joke, 
but now I can't imagine life without it.

'When we have people round and the 
champagne's flowing I start playing music, but I usually get kicked off 
pretty fast because everybody wants a go.'

The race day at Longchamp in September
is used to trial horses for the highlight of the racecourse's calendar,
the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held in October.

He finished second in one race, third in two others and was unplaced in the fourth.

Jockey Kieren Fallon was banned for 
six months by France Galop in 2006 after a positive test. It banned him 
for another 18 months after a second positive test in August 2007.
