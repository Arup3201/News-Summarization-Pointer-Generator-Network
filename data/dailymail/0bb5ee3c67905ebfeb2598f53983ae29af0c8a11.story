Every trace of debris will be removed when Sandy Hook Elementary School is pulled down next week to stop sick souvenir hunters visiting the site where 20 children were killed.

Gunman Adam Lanza shot dead 26 people including 20 first-graders last December before taking his own life at the school in Newtown, Connecticut.

The 20-year-old killed his mother, Nancy, in her bed and then set off to the school armed with an assault rifle, two pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Arriving at the school on December 14, he shot through the glass windows of the school entrance where he met Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the gunfire before shooting them both dead.

Lanza then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the room trying to hide in a bathroom.

The deranged shooter killed Rousseau and all but one of her class.

The little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.'

She was the only survivor from a class of 16.

The school will be demolished next week and the steel which supported the structure will be melted to ensure no-one descends on the area to collect remnants of the site. 

Officials have said the debris will be taken to an 'undisclosed location'.

Patricia Llodra said: 'We want to be absolutely certain to do everything we can to protect the privacy of the families and the Sandy Hook community.

'We’re going to every possible length to eliminate any possibility that any artifacts from the building would be taken from the campus and . . . end up on eBay.'

Demolition is expected to finish before the first anniversary of the massacre on December 14. 

A new school funded by a $49.3 million state grant will be built for the children of Newtown.

Consigli Construction, a project management company, will be in charge of the demolition and the new build. 

Construction workers have to undergo background checks and will be banned from discussing what they are doing in the school. 

Since the massacre, children in Newtown have been going to school in the neighbouring town of Monroe.

Fraud: Nouel Alba pretended to be the aunt of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner

A New York City woman who posed as the aunt of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre and solicited money has been sentenced to eight months in prison.

Nouel Alba, 37, pleaded guilty in June to federal charges of wire fraud and making false statements.

Beginning on the day of the shootings last December, prosecutors said, Alba used Facebook, emails, text messages and telephone calls to falsely claim to be the aunt of six-year-old Noah Pozner.

Authorities said she told people she was collecting donations for a funeral fund on behalf of Noah's family and the families of other victims of the shooting.

Alba's sentencing followed an emotional victim impact statement given in court by Mark Mattioli, father of six-year-old victim James Mattioli.

Speaking at times through tears, Mattioli asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael P. Shea to impose a sentence of 26 months, one for each of the Newtown school victims.

'Her actions were anything but gentle,' Mattioli said. 

'They were immediate, intrusive, exploitative, disgusting, and they added to my feeling of victimisation.'

Prosecutors acknowledged that Alba collected only about $240 through her efforts and repaid it.

But special assistant U.S. attorney Jonathan Francis argued for prison time, saying Alba's actions had caused emotional harm to the community and created a chilling effect on charitable giving.

'It's a callous, calculating attempt to profit off the murder of children,' he said.

Mattioli contrasted Alba's fraud and the actions of a man who had delivered food to his front door in the days after the shooting and asked for nothing in return.

'He chose love; she chose evil,' he said.

Defense attorneys had argued in their sentencing memorandum for probation, saying Alba had suffered enough at the hands of the media as 'something of a stand-in for the actual perpetrator of the Sandy Hook massacre.'

Alba has been hounded by the press, has lost her friends, has been unable to maintain a steady job and is facing foreclosure on her home, they said.

Alba declined to speak at the hearing. Defense attorney Gary Weinberger compared her to a Colonial-era criminal put in the stocks to have fruit thrown at her.

'She was and has been made into an incredible pariah,' he said.

The judge said he took into account Alba's position as a single mother of two children, including one with autism, when passing sentence.

He said he wanted to make it clear she was not being punished as a proxy for the shooter.

He said a prison sentence was necessary because of the psychological damage inflicted by Alba's actions and to deter others from committing similar frauds.

'The attempt to profit from a national tragedy,' he said, 'was outrageous'.
