Ashley Greene's Hollywood apartment burst into flames on Friday morning as the actress slept-  and the cause has been put down to a candle.

After local law enforcement carried out a preliminary investigation on the premises they determined that a unattended candle was the cause of the fire.

According to website TMZ the candle is what started the fire as the Twilight star, her unnamed boyfriend and brother were woken by the flames, which broke out on the living room sofa.

Three people were treated for minor 
injuries, with other reports of two people suffering burns and receiving
 hospital treatment, although identities have not been confirmed at this stage.

It
 is unclear if Greene’s unnamed boyfriend is Reese Witherspoon’s 
ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, 38. The pair became the subject of romance 
rumours this week after being photographed leaving Hollywood’s Vignette 
Lounge on Wednesday.

One of Greene's two fox terrier dogs perished in the 
blaze and was found dead under the bed, according to a resident who 
spoke to TMZ. A second dog was taken by Animal Control to be 
checked out.

The 26-year-old actress, who plays vampire Alice Cullen in the Twilight franchise, fled the apartment with her 
brother and boyfriend after being woken by the fire. The two men apparently tried to go back to save the dogs after realising they were still inside but
 were unable to re-enter.

 covered in soot and pictures of the inconsolable actress cradling her 
dead pet, wrapped in a blanket, have since been published on TMZ.

Several residents tried to tackle the blaze with fire extinguishers before at least 
10 fire trucks screeched to the scene of the historic A-list complex, which was once lived
 in by Marilyn Monroe.

The fire was quickly brought under control and extinguished just after 10am following a 9.50am emergency call.

Quick response: Firefighters scale the roof of the complex. The fire was extinguished just after 10am

A
 spokesman for the actress told People.com that the cause of the fire is
 'undetermined' although a firefighter at the scene told TMZ the blaze 
started on the sofa.

The apartment is located in the 
Granville Towers complex on Crescent Heights Boulevard in the West Hollywood, which has 
been home to many celebrities including Monroe, Mickey Rourke and Portia de Rossi.

One-bedroom suites alone command monthly rentals of between $3,000 and $4,000 at the luxurious 1930s-era landmark building, situated yards away from spas, gyms, theatres and a glamorous night scene catering for the rich and famous.

Friday's incident triggered a huge emergency response, with 55 firefighters working at the scene and 10 ambulances parked down the street.

Eyewitness Erin Boyle told MailOnline: 'It was completely burnt out, [Greene's] whole apartment was burnt to a crisp. All the 
windows were blown out with smoke billowing out of them.

'All of the building had been evacuated and all of the residence were outside. Some looked scared, some were angry.'

A second witness, Sam Nolan, said, described the drama as like a scene from a disaster movie.

'All of a sudden police rushed to close the street, blocking
 both ends. Then fire trucks started roaring down the street.

‘Three or four of the fire trucks had
 ladders going up the complex. One going into her apartment, one going onto the roof and one going around the rear.
‘All you could see was black smoke.'

Mr Nola went on: 'Everyone was looking, the neighbours were taking pictures and then a TV crew turned up.

'It was like a disaster film, I thought I’d become part of a Day After Tomorrow.'

Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector Johnson confirmed crews were dispatched at 9:50 am.

'We made an aggressive fire attack. Our team saw smoke and fire coming from the third floor,' he told RadarOnline.

Inspector Johnson added: 'We have 
reports of two patrons that were burned, so they were treated by the 
paramedics and sent to the hospital.'

Mystery: It is unclear if Greene’s unnamed 
boyfriend is Reese Witherspoon’s ex-husband Ryan Phillippe. The pair
