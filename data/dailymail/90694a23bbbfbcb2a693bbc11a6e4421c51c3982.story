A Washington state soldier and father is two is in critical condition after a slow-rolling police car ran over him and dragged him down the street.

The entire shocking incident was caught on the surveillance camera from a nearby home.

The video obtained by KIRO-TV shows 22-year-old Emanuel Andrade inexplicably lay down in the middle of a residential street in Tacoma, Washington, about 1am Sunday.

A patrol car can be seen slowing creeping up to the man's body and then rolling over him.

Horrific: Emanuel Andrade, 22, can be seen here in the middle of the road seconds before a squad car ran over him and left him clinging to life

The squad car bounces twice - once as the front wheels roll over the father-of-two and once, several yards later, as the rear wheels leave him behind

Andrade, an Afghanistan War veteran who is stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, was set to leave the military later this summer

Andrade is visible in the squad car's headlights for nearly 30 seconds before the vehicle suddenly accelerates and runs over him.

The car jolts twice, once when Andrade is hit and once a few yards later when the back tires roll over him and leave him in the street.

A police spokesman said the officer was doing a neighborhood patrol and was staring at his in-car computer screen when he hit Andrade.

'I just understand that the officer just didn't see him,' Tacoma police spokeswoman Loretta Cool told KIRO.

The department is refusing to name the officer and said he will not be suspended because the incident was an accident.

Andrade, 22, has a seven-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. His 23rd birthday is next week

Andrade is breathing through a tube, cannot open his eyes and suffers from numerous broken bones. He is clinging to life in critical condition

Andrade's wife Susana is furious.

'He just proceeded with running him over and dragging him down the street,' she told KIRO.

'You canâ€™t put an excuse to that.'

Andrade is the father of a three-year-old boy and seven-year-old girl. He's a veteran of the War in Afghanistan and is station at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma.

Mrs Andrade said her husband was out with friends before the accident. She had no idea why he laid down in the street.

Andrade, who will be discharged from the Army later this summer, has numerous broken bones, is breathing through a tube and cannot open his eyes.

'You could actually see blood coming out of his eyes,' Mrs Andrade said.
