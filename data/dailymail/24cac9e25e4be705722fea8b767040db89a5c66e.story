Don't you just hate it when you get on a flight to find you've got hardly any leg room and feel a bit cramped?

Well next time you think about complaining, spare a thought for these Sumo wrestlers on their way to a training camp in Japan.

The 29 wrestlers boarded a small propeller plane for their flight to the camp at Okinshima, an island in the Shimane Prefecture.

The sportsmen appear to be a little relieved after getting off the plane at the end of their flight

The sportsmen belong to the Hakkaku stable, which is based in the neighbourhood of Ryogoku, in Tokyo.

The stable's official Twitter account shared these pictures, which show the wrestlers making their way through check-out before getting on to the cramped plane.

The sumo wrestlers look somewhat relieved when they finally make it off the plane, but they are soon transferred on to an equally cramped-looking bus.

Japan's national sport, sumo is believed to have originated up to 2,000 years ago, according to Sumotalk.com.

It involves two wrestlers attempting to force each other out of a circular ring.

There are no weight restrictions, and so wrestlers can vary in size and power.
