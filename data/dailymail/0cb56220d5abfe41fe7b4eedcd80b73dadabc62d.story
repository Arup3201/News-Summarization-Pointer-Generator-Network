A Florida appeals court judge has ruled that an insurer is not liable for damages that occurred to an apartment after a neighbor's dead body 'exploded.'

Judy Rodrigo battled State Farm for almost six years, arguing that the insurer of her Jupiter condo should pay for the clean-up of her apartment.

She argued that the Keystone Condominium Association left the neighbor's corpse so long that the body's fluid leaked into her apartment.

'Putrid effluvia': Judy Rodrigo's apartment was damaged by her neighbor's corpse, which rotted, undiscovered, for two weeks before 'exploding'

Rodrigo's civil lawsuit against State Farm stated that 'another unit owner's body exploded thereby causing blood and bodily fluids to go into the adjoining condominium and the unit owned by Judy Rodrigo.'

The neighbor's body was discovered an estimated two weeks after her death after a foul odor filled the adjacent units.

The elderly woman's puppy had been feeding on the corpse, according to the Courthouse New Service.

The body was so decayed that gases caused the abdomen to bloat and eventually burst, releasing fluids.

'I don't know how the dog stayed alive. It must have been at her for some time,' neighbor Nicholas Colangelo told Court House News in 2009.

State Farm offered Rodrigo a sum for the clean-up, but she refused it, seeking full coverage.

She argued that her policy covered personal property damage, including 'explosions.'

Not covered: The judge ruled that the neighbors body bursting during decomposition does not constitute an explosion

State Farm argued that a decomposing body does not constitute an explosion - and Judge Melanie May agreed.

'Rather than stretching common sense, the trial court correctly gave the term "explosion" its "plain and unambiguous meaning as understood by the man on the street,"' May wrote.

'The plain meaning of the term "explosion" does not include a decomposing body's cells explosively expanding, causing leakage of bodily fluids.'

May wrote that Roderigo's attempt to prove the body exploded was 'novel' but ultimately ruled against her.
