Pickwick & Weller, a T-shirt line which touted Ashton Kutcher as its celebrity co-founder, has closed its doors after one year in business.

The e-commerce label, which is known for its simple tees for men and women, has posted a placard on its website that says ‘Pickwick & Weller is taking an extended staycation so we can come back with the best T-shirt. Ever.’

However, the brand’s co-founder Ryan Donahue has told Fashionista that the brand has no plans to relaunch.

Closed for business: Though Pickwick & Weller's site says that the brand is currently seeking an overhaul, its co-founder has confirmed that the brand is closed for good

Celebrity founder: Ashton Kutcher, the celebrity co-founder and investor in Pickwick & Keller, was joined by fellow opportunists on the project - including multiple Warby Parker executives and venture capitalist firms

‘We were unable to scale our customer acquisition to a rate that brought the necessary growth, at a cost sustainable for our business,’ Mr Donahue said. He has already obtained another job at ZenDesk – a software and IT company.

Though Mr Kutcher, 36, was widely promoted as one of the label’s co-founders, it seems as of now that he fulfilled more of an investor role in the company – contributing to its initial $4million round of funding along with Warby Parker executives and various venture capitalist firms.

Pickwick & Weller launched in April 2013 with a small run of T-shirt styles including V-necks, crew necks, and henleys. The shirts came with a soft, distressed finish and were fabricated in neutral colors like mustard yellow, rust, white, navy blue, and army green.

Similar to Warby Parker's model, shoppers were allowed to try samples of the shirts on at home with a FedEx Fit Kit to find the silhouette and size that best suited their body before settling on one to keep.

Shortly after the launch Mr Kutcher told ELLE.com: ‘T-shirts are the uniform of this generation. If you are going to wear something every day, it should be the best. Our aim is to make the best T-shirts on earth.’

The basics: The brand was known for its e-commerce-only run of T-shirts which came in simple shapes and colors

Best fit: The brand would send customers a 'fit kit' to help them find which size and shape was best for their body

Mr Donahue added to PandoDaily yesterday that the label held a conference call with its primary investors (presumably including Mr Kutcher) before reaching the unanimous decision that it was best to close the brand.

‘We had a hard conversation with our board and investors, and we mutually agreed that we gave it a good shot and it's time to move on. We built a good brand and a great product, with loyal customers, but where we really struggled was in unlocking healthy enough customer acquisition to scale it to a point where it made sense. We simply ran out of time and runway,’ he said.

Mr Donahue reports that the brand did $1million of sales in its first year and had a higher customer retention rate than many of its competitors. However, its margins and growth were not large enough to succeed.
