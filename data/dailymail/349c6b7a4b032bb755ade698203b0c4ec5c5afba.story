After three months of closure, the Lindt Chocolate Café at the centre of the Sydney Siege is set to reopen in a matter of days.

Workers at the scene of one of Australia's most infamous terror attacks  told The Daily Telegraph the Sydney CBD cafe will reopen by the end of the week.

The café made headlines around the world in December when gunman Man Haron Monis held staff and patrons hostage there for about 17 hours.

Lawyer and mother Katrina Dawson, manager Tori Johnson and Monis died when police stormed the building on December 16.

The sudden opening comes only one month after Lindt's chief executive Stephen Loane announced plans to recommence business.

Mr Loane revealed in a statement that a key feature of the new store would be a memorial to the siege victims.

'We have taken this decision after careful consideration of a number of ­factors, the most important of which was consultation with our staff,' he said.

Some of the hostages who were held alongside Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson shared the agony and fear they felt in televised interviews on 60 Minutes and Seven News this week. 

They told of how Monis forced them to call emergency services to tell them his demands, and how the gunman became more frustrated as night fell. 

Louisa Hope, 52, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die. 

Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff.

A total of 18 people were taken hostage and were forced by captor Man Haron Monis to hold an Islamic flag up to the windows during the siege

In their store reopening announcement, Lindt encouraged people to visit the charity page set up in Mr Johnson's honour. 

'Tori was someone who had a very positive approach to life and this page was set up in Tori's memory after the event to raise funds for beyondblue, a charity chosen by his family,' the spokesman said. 

'We know that all concerned, including Tori's family, are deeply grateful for the donations being made.'

Thousands of messages and flowers were laid outside the Lindt cafe in the weeks following the siege
