A homeowner checking his house after tenants moved out found the property had been rigged with explosives set to detonate with the flip of a light switch.

Lendel Williams was inspecting the house in Milton, Massachusetts on Tuesday as he prepared to sell the home when his electrician came across the suspicious device in a bedroom closet.

They called police and it was successfully deactivated a few hours later.

'I am angry,' Lendel told reporters outside the home on Tuesday night. 'I just can't believe people can really do that to be quite frank with you.'

Danger: This owner of this home in Milton, Massachusetts found it had been rigged with explosives

Safe: The homeowner called police who arrived at the home on Tuesday and deactivated the device

Investigation: Hours later they declared the home safe and removed items from the property

The electrician found the explosive device behind a recently plastered section of wall in a bedroom closet, CBS Boston reported.

The mechanism involved a gallon of a flammable substance with wires snaking out of it and around the house. The end of the wire led to a light switch.

'We believe the intention was that if someone flipped the light switch on where it ended, the device would have exploded,' Milton Police Chief Richard Wells said. 'It took some work to put it in there.'

Authorities said the intricate system could have caused 'significant destruction' if it had been set off and could have even resulted in a loss of life. 

Police have not yet named any suspects and said they are considering anyone with access to the house as a person of interest in the case, WCVB reported.

Shock: Homeowner Lendel Williams, pictured, said he could not believe that someone had set up the device, which his electrician found behind a recently-plastered wall during an inspection on Tuesday

Scene: Police and members of the bomb squad swarm the street outside the home on Tuesday

But Williams said he believes his former tenants could be responsible and the Boston and Milton police departments are looking for them. 

Last week, police were called to the home for an act of vandalism after Williams found cement had been poured down the drain.

On Sunday, a few days after the complaint was filed, the former tenants, a man, his wife and their daughter, moved out.

They had lived at the property since June.

Police were called to the home on Craig Street and several hours later, a bomb squad rendered the device safe. Officers were seen removing brown bags from the house.
