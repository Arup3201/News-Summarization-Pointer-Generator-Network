Ashya King has today made his first visit to the  Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech Republic where he is expected to receive the pioneering treatment that prompted the legal wrangle over his care.

With his parents by his side, the five-year-old was taken to the centre in Prague today for his first tests as doctors prepare him for the treatment for his brain tumour.

The little boy was yesterday flown to Prague from Spain after leaving the Materno Infantil hospital in Malaga in Spain, where he has been treated since his parents were arrested more than a week ago.

He was then admitted to University Hospital Motol in the Czech capital, while his father Brett King visited the Proton Therapy Centre Czech (PTC) to discuss the potential treatment.

Ashya was pictured today as he was taken into the centre to begin examinations prior to the start of the treatment. 

A spokeswoman for the hospital told the Press Association: 'He will be undergoing the first MRI examination and a special mask (will be prepared) for his head.

'This will be used for fixing him in the same position during the treatment every day.

'He will be put asleep before that and he will wake up after noon.'

The Kings triggered an international police pursuit when they removed Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28.

They were desperate for him to be given the proton therapy, which was not available to them on the NHS.

Speaking after arriving in the Czech Republic, Ashya's father told Sky News they were 'just so happy to be here'.

He said: 'This is what we wanted from the beginning. Things went from bad to worse at one stage.

'We just want the best for Ashya. He's got to get through this, he's got to get better.'

Mr King said his son was 'a little bit depressed' when they were first reunited.

'He's building up his strength now. We are sure he can see us and he can definitely hear us,' he said. 

Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe 

'I am sure they are going to give him the best treatment. We just hope for the best for him.'

The Proton Therapy Centre arranged for a private Cessna Citation Mustang jet fitted with medical equipment to transport the young patient from Spain.

In an earlier statement yesterday, the clinic said: 'In late afternoon today, Proton Therapy Centre Czech is expecting a visit by Mr Brett King, Ashya's father. 

'Mr King will be shown the facility, he will be introduced to the process of treatment and to a team of the attending physicians and physicists.' 

Ashya will undergo tests ahead of the possible proton treatment next week, according to reports. It is expected to last for around five weeks, with Ashya staying at Motol hospital and travelling to the Proton Therapy Centre each day.

The High Court judge who approved Ashya's transfer to Prague made no criticism of anyone involved in the saga.

Mr Justice Baker said there had been reason to believe that Ashya was at risk when his parents took him from the hospital in Southampton.

He said social workers had been justified in asking the High Court to take responsibility for the youngster.

And he said any parents in Mr and Mrs King's position would have wanted to explore all options.

'The local authority acted corrected in applying to the High Court,' said Mr Justice Baker.

'There were reasonable grounds for believing that Ashya was at risk of significant harm.

'A week later the picture had changed that the court was faced with a completely different decision.'

He added: 'Any parents in the position of Mr and Mrs King would do whatever they could to explore all options.'

Mr Justice Baker was speaking as he outlined his reasons for allowing Ashya to travel to Prague - at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

He said he 'made no comment' about the decision to issue a European arrest warrant - a move which led to Mr and Mrs King being held in custody in Spain and separated from their son.

He said he 'merely observed' that 'whatever the rights and wrongs', it had not been in Ashya's interests to be separated from his parents.

The judge said he hoped Ashya made a good recovery and sent his best wishes to his 'loving parents'.

He said Asyha's arrival in Prague meant he was no longer a ward of the English High Court.

Ashya hit the headlines after his parents took him from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without the permission of doctors.

They were arrested and held in custody in Spain after British police raised the alarm. They were released when prosecutors withdrew an arrest warrant in the wake of a public outcry.
