The son of a former congressional candidate has miraculously survived after a grizzly bear he shot during a hunt in Alaska hid in bushes for 90 minutes before seeking revenge and attacking him.

John O. Matson Jr., from Charlestown, Rhode Island, was listed in fair condition at an Anchorage hospital on Wednesday after suffering head and leg injuries and undergoing head surgery.

The 46-year-old hunter was attacked by the bear on Monday during a guided hunt near Beaver Mountain, about 40 miles southwest of the interior town of McGrath.

He is the son of John 'The Carpenter' Matson, Sr., who ran in the 2nd congressional district of Rhode Island for the House of Representatives last year - but missed out to incumbent Jim Langevin.

He told the Associated Press on Wednesday that his son - one of his four children - was lucky to be alive and is now recovering from his surgery.

Matson Jr was with another hunter and an assistant 
guide near Beaver Mountain when they saw the bear feeding on berries about a mile away and moved toward 
it.

Matson fired and hit the bear, which then rolled into 
bushes. It thrashed around for about a minute before it bolted out and ran into heavier brush, state troopers told the Anchorage Daily News.

The men waited for around 90 minutes before approaching the bush but Matson was attacked.

The assistant guide was around 30 feet away when he heard Matson scream and fire his gun. He and the other hunter fired 
shots to distract the bear and it ran off and has not since been found.

Matson was bleeding profusely from his head, but the assistant guide wrapped clothing around the wounds and called for help.

But bad weather prevented rescuers from quickly reaching Matson's party. He was eventually rescued from the remote spot on Tuesday, suffering from bite marks on his head and leg.

The aircraft flew Matson to McGrath and a LifeMed Alaska flight transported him 225 miles southeast to an Anchorage hospital, where he remains.
