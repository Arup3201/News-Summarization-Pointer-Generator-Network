Italian police say they have arrested the ‘crucifixion killer’ at his home in Florence.

Riccardo Vitia, a 55-year-old plumber was arrested at dawn on suspicion of the rape and murder of prostitute Andrea Cristina Zamfir whose lifeless body was found under a bridge in the Florentine village of Ugnano on Monday.

The Romanian had been taped to a metal gate by the wrists into a crucifixion pose and was naked apart from her tennis shoes and socks.

Murdered: Andrea Cristina Zamfir, 26, was found naked and bound with tape, beneath a bridge in Ugnano, a village near Florence, Italy. A man has now been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape

She had been tortured with a metal rod and an autopsy showed she died of an internal haemorrhage. 

Vitia who lived at home with his parents has admitted a part in the murder, after being questioned for two hours, it is alleged.

Police chief Raffaele Micillo told Sky TG 24: ‘The man arrested is certainly responsible for this crime, and probably other similar events that have been previously reported.’

Home Secretary of Italy Angelino Alfano tweeted: ‘The police have arrested this morning the man responsible for the killing of the Romanian woman on 5 April. Incontrovertible evidence has been found in his possession. He has confessed to the crime. #monsterofFlorence. My thanks to the men and women of the police.’

At the moment of arrest Mr Vitia he allegedly told police ‘I’m finished. No one can save me now.’

His distraught mother stroked his hair saying: ‘I don’t believe it. You can’t be the monster of Ugnano,’ Corriere della Sera reported.

Mr Vitia’s home was in the district of the Careggi hospital where the tape used to bind the dead woman was sourced. His partner is thought to have worked there.

Tape from the hospital was allegedly found at his home during the police raid.

They also found a white Fiat Doblo van matching the description of the women who claimed that he drove a light-coloured van, according to reports in the Italian media.

A local police inspector said the woman had a slow and terrible death after being found in the crucifixion position

Miss Zamfir's mother and sister, who 
live in Montesarchio in the south of Italy, said that she had been 
missing for six years after moving to live with a relative in Florence.

Her
 sister Elena Alina Zamfir said: 'For me she was always an angel. I 
still love her so much and just want to bring her body home.'

The mayor of Montesarchio has arranged a collection to bring her body home for a funeral.
