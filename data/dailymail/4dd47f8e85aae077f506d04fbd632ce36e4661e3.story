The world's oldest living person has celebrated her sweet 116!

Besse Cooper, from Monroe, Georgia, rang in her 116th year of life on Sunday, surrounded by friends and family at the nursing home where she now lives.

Her loved ones gathered to mark her special day, at a low-key fete, according to her son Sidney Cooper,
who said his elderly mom was 'not up for big celebrations.'

Happy Birthday Besse! World's oldest living person, Besse Cooper, celebrated her 116th year of life on Sunday

When asked about her secret to 
long life, Mrs Cooper stated squarely, 'I mind my own business and I 
don't eat junk food,' in comments to the Guinness World Records.

Her remarks seem in line with her son's observation that, 'the older she has gotten the more
wittier she has gotten.'

Sidney Cooper credits his mom's longevity to her active lifestyle, healthy living and spunky personalities

'She
never had surgery in her life,' Sidney Cooper told the Georgia Health News about his 
amazing mother, explaining that she avoided fatty foods and ate her 
veggies. 

She
'never ate junk food,' he said, though he admitted 
she did enjoy potato chips, bacon and eggs and fried chicken, on 
occasion... but everything in moderation.

Three of Besse Cooper's four children (from left to right: Angie, Nancy and Sidney) cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony for the bridge named in their mother's honor on Friday

'She ate a lot of vegetables and she always worked outside,' particularly lawn maintenance and raking leaves.

'She's
healthy, no major problems,' he said, adding that even now she takes 
very few medications and had lived on her own until she was 105, when she 
became too frail.

Besse was born on August 26, 1896, in Sullivan, Tennessee and moved to Georgia in 1917.

She married her husband, Luther Cooper, in 1924 and they had four 
children: Angie, Luther, Sidney and Nancy. Her husband died in 1963 and she never remarried.

Today, Besse has 12 grandchildren and a slew of great-grandchildren and even great-great grandchildren.

For Besse: The bridge named for the world's oldest living person is located in Between, Georgia, near where Mrs Cooper had worked as a school teacher as a 19-year-old

Festivities to mark her momentous 
birthday began on Friday, when her children and local Georgia elected officials gathered to dedicate a bridge named in 
her honor.

The bridge on the New Hope Road over the Alcovy River, located in Between, Georgia, is near where Mrs Cooper had worked as a
school teacher as a 19-year-old.

'It never had a name before, and it is close to where her house used to be,' her son Sidney told local media about why the family lobbied to have the structure bear her name.

Unfortunately Mrs Cooper was too frail to travel to the bridge for the dedication but her son said his mother told him, 'I'm glad I gave them a reason to name it.'

Local celebrity: Georgia Governor Nathan Deal visited the supercentenarian in 2011 and read a proclamation honoring her long life

Mrs Cooper’s remarkable age has made her a celebrity in her own right.

In honor of her 115th birthday in 2011, Georgia Governor Nathan
Deal visited the supercentenarian and read a proclamation honoring her long life.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Cooper was certified as the world's oldest living person in January 2011.

Congrats! Flanked by her family and a Guinness World Records representative, Robert Young, in 2011, Besse Cooper is recognized as the world's oldest living person

But then another woman, Brazilian-born Maria Gomes Valentin, was discovered to be 48 days older.

Mrs Valentin died on June 21, 2011 and Cooper was reinstated as the world's oldest person.

About .2 per cent of the U.S. population are classified as centenarians, people aged 100 or older.
