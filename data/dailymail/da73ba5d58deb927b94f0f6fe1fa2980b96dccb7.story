Authorities have arrested a gunman suspected of randomly opening fire on five public places in Maryland over the past week, in attacks that left two  injured.

What appears to be the same blue car had been linked to the attacks in which a gunman opened fire on a driver at a mall, a Walmart, a movie theater, a truck on a highway and headquarters of the NSA over the last seven days.

If the same gunman is behind all the attacks, it would be a case with chilling similarities to the DC Sniper attacks of 2002 when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue Chevrolet sedan.

Early morning reports on Wednesday revealed that a suspect was in custody who was believed to be involved in the shootings that occurred since last Tuesday in the Baltimore-Washington metro area, according to the Washington Post. 

Lt. Kevin Ayd, a spokesman for the Maryland Transportation Authority Police told the Baltimore Sun of the five shootings: 'They're looking into whether these are linked together.'

So far, only two dump truck workers have been hurt in the attacks - they suffered only minor injuries when the gunfire shattered the windshield of their vehicle and by a bullet fragment.

Five recent Maryland shootings that took place in public spaces may be connected to the same shooter, according to authorities briefed on the investigation. Police are searching for the same gray or blue Lincoln Town car that has been spotted near some of the crime scenes (the Lincoln Town car pictured above)

Investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties: Anne Arundel, Prince George's and Howard (above map of where the shootings took place)

The first shooting attack involved a 61-year-old man whose windows on his car were shot out as he was driving through the Arundel Mills shopping complex on February 24 around 7.30am.

Tuesday, February 24, 7.30am: Arundel Mills shopping complex

Saturday, February 28: Footage of Lincoln Town Car released

Monday, March 2, early morning: Walmart Supercenter in Laurel

Monday, March 2, 5.10am: AMC Theater at The Mall in Columbia

Tuesday, March 3, 3pm: Intercounty Connector in Laurel

Tuesday, March 3, 5pm: National Security Agency in Fort Meade

The following Saturday, the footage of the Lincoln Town car was released, according to the Baltimore Sun.

The surveillance video has captured the car but a license plate has not been determined nor has a clear identity of the shooter. 

Police were notified of a shooting at a Walmart in Laurel in the second reported shooting on Monday, March 2.

That same day, a cleaning crew staff member reportedly heard gunshots around 5.10am at the AMC Theater at The Mall in Columbia.

On Tuesday, a dump truck carrying the two Nelson Tree Specialist workers was traveling eastbound on the Intercounty Connector, also known as Route 200, when it was struck by gunshots coming from a nearby wooded area just before 3pm - in the fourth shooting.

The attack left both passengers with non-life-threatening injuries leaving one injured from shattered glass and one bruised from a bullet fragment blocked by his clothing, according to the Washington Post.

Only 12 miles away from the shooting on the ICC, an attack involving the National Security Agency in Fort Meade (above) occurred where several gunshots struck one of its office buildings around 5pm. No injuries to NSA personnel were reported, a spokesperson for the NSA told Daily Mail Online

Only 12 miles away, the most recent shooting occurred involving the National Security Agency in Fort Meade where several gunshots struck one of its office buildings around 5pm.

No injuries to NSA personnel were reported, a spokesperson for the NSA told Daily Mail Online.

Police spokeswoman Sgt. Lelani Woods said that the NSA reported damage to one of its buildings close to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Tuesday.

At the time, she said it is too early to determine whether the damage is related to the report of gunfire nearby. 

Investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties: Anne Arundel, Prince George's and Howard.

Ballistic evidence has also suggested a possible link between the shootings, two anonymous sources told the Baltimore Sun. 

The FBI is coordinating the multi-jurisdiction investigation as it continues. 

The back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002, when a sniper, John Allen Muhammad (left) and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (right) terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings

Back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002, when a sniper terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings.

Ten people were killed and three injured in the 14 October shootings which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem.

Shooter John Allen Muhammad and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo started their spree in February 2002, with murders in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Washington State.

That cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured.

It was only in October though that the murders became more targeted on the Virginia and Maryland areas immediately surrounding DC - earning the name the Beltway sniper attacks.

The attacks left DC residents afraid to leave their homes for weeks, since the nature of the shootings were random, and the shooter fired from a distance and never confronted his victims face to face.

But Muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a Tarot card inscribed with the phrase 'Call me God'.

Muhammad and Malvo's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on October 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in Myersville, Maryland and taken into custody.

The following September, Muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death. His accomplice Malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed.

When Malvo went on trial, his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of Muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes, which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole.

Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009.
