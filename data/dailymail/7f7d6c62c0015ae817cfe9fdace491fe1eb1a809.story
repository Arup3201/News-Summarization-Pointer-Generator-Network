The pressure on beleaguered Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has increased further after an influential local newspaper called for his immediate sacking.

The Birmingham Mail have risked punishment by Villa for their stance but pulled no punches by demanding the club axe the 45-year-old Scot.

Under a piece titled 'Birmingham Mail says: Lambert must go!', the paper makes its outspoken stance after the club dropped into the Barclays Premier League relegation zone following their latest dismal defeat.

The Birmingham Mail has called for Paul Lambert's sacking with this hard-hitting message

'Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football,' it says.

'It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game.

'But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen.

'Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager.'

Tuesday's 2-0 loss at fellow relegation-battlers Hull leaves Villa third bottom of the table and many of their fans are demanding change.

Jores Okore's strike in Saturday's defeat against Chelsea was Villa's first goal in exactly 11 hours of football. Since Boxing Day, Villa have not won in eight games and are easily in the worst form of any top-flight club.

'We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go,' continues the Birmingham Mail, who then claim that he is not the man to save the club from relegation.

That would be a 'disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover.'

Lambert is also accused of being responsible for 'poor, and too often dull, performances' and 'awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief'.

'Villa must act now - before it’s too late,' the piece urges before concluding: 'Enough is enough.'

Meanwhile, former Villa striker Andy Gray has also put the boot into Lambert.

'(Villa) have got all the hallmarks of a team that is going down,' Gray told talkSPORT.

'Paul comes out every week and says, "we played quite well today". That might be the case, but they are not winning football matches, and they don’t look like winning football matches.

'I really worry for my old club. I am not one for seeing people lose their jobs, but sometimes change is necessary.

'Paul is a great lad, but it just hasn’t worked for him at Villa.'

Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football.

It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game.

But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen.

Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager.

Paul Lambert is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long-term damage that disaster will bring.

We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go.

The Birmingham Mail has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans, standing by and hoping things will improve.

Despite the results, despite the performances.

But time is now up.

No progress has been made under Lambert. In fact, this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face.

A relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £2 billion Sky and BT television deal.

Dropping down a division would be a disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover.

As custodian of the club, Randy Lerner must ensure it doesn’t happen.

Lambert has presided over just two Premier League victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four-year deal in mid-September.

The poor, and too often dull, performances mean the team is last on Match Of The Day nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later Saturday night slot on the Football League show next season.

That’s why Villa must act now - before it’s too late.

Awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief.

Aston Villa should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive, to compete in the higher reaches of the league.

Long-ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession-based style of play.

Now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will, he says.

We don’t believe Lambert anymore. He is out of ideas, there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he hasn’t said already.

We respect his integrity and loyalty, but the fans don’t want him.

The fans deserve better.

Enough is enough.
