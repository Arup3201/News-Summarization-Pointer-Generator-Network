A Sydney woman is facing criminal charges for selling faulty electrical cables which sparked a multimillion dollar national recall.

Lu Luo imported the wires from China, according to News Corp, before selling them through 18 national suppliers and popular hardware stores including Masters Home Improvement, John Danks and Sons and Mitre 10.

Her faulty product has led to the launch of a national task-force made up of consumer agencies, building regulators and electrical safety regulators who are working to locate and replace the cables in an estimated 40,000 homes and business across Australia before they cause a fire or severe electrocution.

The cables have been recalled by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a process that is expected to cost over $80 million, and Ms Luo's company, Infinity Cable Co, has gone into liquidation

Luo's company, Infinity Cable Co, has gone into liquidation and a recall was issued on August 27 for cables labelled 'INFINITY' and 'OLSENT' if they were sourced from the company.

'NSW Fair Trading can confirm it has commenced proceedings against Ms Lu Lou also known as Vid Luo in the summary criminal jurisdiction of the NSW Supreme Court for selling electrical articles in breach of the Electricity (Consumer Safety) Act 2004 (NSW). A preliminary hearing date has been set down for 20 November 2014,' a NSW Fair Trading spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

A spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that the estimated cost of the recall is $80 million.

News Corp has also revealed that Woolworths sold up to 40 per cent of the recalled wires through their hardware chains Thrifty-Link Hardware and Home Timber and Hardware. 

The insulation coating on the cables was found to be of poor quality, meaning they could break prematurely and cause a fire or electrocution

The cables failed to meet electrical safety standards when the insulation coating was found to be of poor quality, meaning they could become brittle and break prematurely. 

'Testing has found that the cables will degrade prematurely and if the cables are disturbed, the insulation could break and expose live conductors, resulting in possible electric shock or fires,' ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.

The ACCC warns that although there is no immediate danger, the risk is heightened if the cables are 'exposed to prolonged high temperatures'.

'Once the insulation is brittle, physical contact with the cables could dislodge the insulation and lead to electric shock or possibly fires.'

About 40,000 homes and business across Australia are believed to have the cables installed 

Although no reports of failure have been recorded as of yet, the ACCC warns the cables are likely to become brittle from 2016 onwards, with the installations posing a higher risk.

The first cable samples from Infinity Cable Co 'were supported by accredited testing certification', according to the ACCC, however subsequent tests deemed them unsafe and led to an initial recall in October 2013 which was then reissued in 2014 with an emphasis on safety concerns.  

Anyone worried about their cables has been warned not to attempt to inspect or remove the cables themselves, but to contact an electrician or their builder.
