Standing outside in rain is probably not most people’s idea of fun.

But for one young toddler, it proved to be a fascinating experience.

A father filmed his son splashing around in a puddle for the first time, perfectly capturing the child’s excitement as he jumps around in the water.

The moment followed a storm outside their home in north California in December.

The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube, shows the young boy struggling to maintain his balance as he spins around in the puddle.

The child’s father said: ‘After weeks of rain in Northern California December 2014. My son was going stir crazy, he needed to go outside.

‘We have been experiencing the worst drought in decades and he had never been out in a rain storm, and the simple pleasure of splashing in a puddle was new to him.

‘As a loving father I try to capture all the firsts in his life. As he became intoxicated by the splashing in the puddle he also became dizzy.

‘Thus I was able to capture what appears to be an adorable toddlers impression of Charlie Chaplin.’
