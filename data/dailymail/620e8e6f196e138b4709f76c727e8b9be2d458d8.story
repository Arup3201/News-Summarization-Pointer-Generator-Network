Arsene Wenger's side left it late to beat Crystal Palace on the opening day of the Premier League season, with Aaron Ramsey stealing all three points for the Gunners with a winner in added time.

The Welsh midfielder was by no means the stand-out performer at the Emirates though, as Jack Wilshere performed well for the hosts and former Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh played brilliantly for Palace.

Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players...

Late winner: Welsh wizard Aaron Ramsey scored in added time to hand Arsenal a 2-1 win at the Emirates

ARSENAL

WOJCIECH SZCZESNY - 6

No chance with the goal after being severely let down by those in front of him. Wasn’t fully tested but mopped up when called upon.

MATHIEU DEBUCHY- 6

The Frenchman was slow to get forward down the right for the Gunners. Yet to show his best form n an Arsenal shirt following his summer move from Newcastle. 

Ponderous: Arsenal right-back Mathieu Debuchy was not at his best against Palace on Saturday afternoon

CALUM CHAMBERS - 6.5

Picked up a silly booking for hauling Fraizer Campbell down, but a solid debut for the youngster who doesn’t look at all overawed after a summer move from Southampton.

LAURENT KOSCIELNY- 7

All or nothing display, as we’ve come to expect from the Frenchman. Frighteningly close to giving away a penalty at one end, then scored just before half-time. Handled the added burden of coaxing Chambers through his debut well.

Firing the Gunners level: Laurent Koscielny, right, is congratulated by Santi Cazorla after making it 1-1

KIERAN GIBBS - 6

Failed to really get down the line as much as he’d like. Decent battle with Jason Puncheon with no clear winner before coming off with a niggle.

MIKEL ARTETA - 5.5

Skipper was over-run in midfield and his performance brought into focus the need for another body in there.

JACK WILSHERE- 6.5

While he did give the ball away frequently early on, a vibrant display full of energy and packed with a desire to get alongside Sanogo.

Late rally: Ramsey, far right, completed an impressive comeback for Arsene Wenger's side with his late goal

AARON RAMSEY - 6.5

Looked a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon and was strangely subdued. Plenty more to come, of course, but the Welshman overhit too many final balls. But you can never keep him out of a game and up he popped in stoppage time to win it.

SANTI CAZORLA - 5.5

Home attacks often ended with Cazorla, who lacked the cutting edge to break down a stubborn visiting side.

ALEXIS SANCHEZ - 6

A case of trying too hard, Sanchez looked bright but very little came off and the Chilean needs to play centrally. Excellent clipped delivery for Koscielny’s equaliser.

Not quite clicking: Chile forward Alexis Sanchez had an up-and-down day at the office for the home side

YAYA SANOGO - 5

Almost looks like a player who’s unsure what’s expected of him or the role in which he’s playing. Languid style doesn’t help and offered nothing off the ball.

SUBS

NACHO MONREAL - threatening down the left, looked fitter than last season.

ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN - struggled to impose himself on proceedings.

OLIVIER GIROUD - Offers Arsenal a different dimension and his presence alone was a deciding factor in Arsenal winning this.

Little impact: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was introduced in the closing stages but failed to leave his mark

CRYSTAL PALACE

JULIAN SPERONI - 6.5

Very little to do, but made one superb save from Jack Wilshere before the end of the first half. Caught well.

MARTIN KELLY - 6.5

Didn’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded forward with purpose.

BREDE HANGELAND - 6

Classy glanced header put Palace ahead, but he was then guilty of losing Koscielny for the equaliser.

First impressions: Ex-Fulham defender Brede Hangeland is mobbed by his Palace team-mates after scoring

SCOTT DANN - 7

Palace’s best signing last year and started this well. Constantly organising the back four, strong in the air and had Sanogo in his pocket before being forced off.

JOEL WARD - 6.5

Unsung hero in last year’s survival and went about his business professionally without much fuss. Kept Sanchez quiet for long spells.

JASON PUNCHEON - 6

One of the most exciting players to watch in the Premier League. Direct runner with an eye for goal and plenty of tricks in his locker. Forever a nuisance, but let himself down badly by catching Monreal studs up and was deservedly sent off.

Composed in the middle: Palace midfielder Joe Ledley shields the ball from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez

Neat and tidy: Palace captain Mile Jedinak nicks the ball from Aaron Ramsey during the second half

MILE JEDINAK - 7

Carried on where he left off last season. Composed on the ball, kept things ticking over in the middle of the park but, more importantly, was disciplined in Palace’s shape.

JOE LEDLEY - 7

Has always been a good reader of the game and is now growing into the central midfield role. Comfortable alongside Jedinak.

YANNICK BOLASIE - 6

Not at his best but the threat of Bolasie’s pace in behind is almost as dangerous as the winger’s ability.

Always a threat: Yannick Bolasie's pace meant he looked dangerous throughout for the visiting side

Star of the show: Much-maligned during his stay at the Emirates, Chamakh shone for Palace on his return

MAROUANE CHAMAKH - 7.5

Superb. Asked to do a very specific job by Keith Millen - dropping in to make five in midfield without the ball - and he followed the caretaker’s instructions to the letter. Even picked up a grubby booking for a late challenge on Wilshere and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.

FRAIZER CAMPBELL - 6.5

Because of Chamakh’s very specific role, the striker found himself a isolated on occasion. Did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances.

SUBS

DAMIEN DELANEY - Brought on for the injured Dann to shore up the back four but could only watch as Arsenal nicked it late on.

DWIGHT GAYLE - Gave Campbell some light relief late on.

STUART O'KEEFE - Time-related substitution in stoppage-time.
