Qatar has been paying migrant workers to attend events in a bid to present itself as a nation of sports fans.

The controversial hosts of the 2022 World Cup pay thousands of fake fans little more than 60p an hour, said a report published on Wednesday.

An Associated Press journalist managed to board one of the buses, witnessing men ‘grappling with each other’ to earn some extra money. ‘These weren’t refugees fleeing disaster,’ said the report. ‘They were migrant workers fighting to earn a few dollars.’

The reporter travelled on one of three buses that took around 150 workers to the Qatar Open beach volleyball event last month.

The FIVB, volleyball’s governing body, celebrated the fact that the World Tour event had ‘brought out the crowds’. But the migrant workers from Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and beyond told the AP reporter they were there only because they were being paid. FIVB media director Richard Baker said he will ‘seek clarification’ from the Qatari organisers.

The buses were over-crowded, with no air conditioning or safety belts, and the fake fans had to wait three hours after the event before being transported back.

FIFA issued a March deadline for labour reforms after reports of human rights violations among migrants employed to work on World Cup venues.

Failure to meet the deadline could see Qatar risk losing the 2022 finals.
