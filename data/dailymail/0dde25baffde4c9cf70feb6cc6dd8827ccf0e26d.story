While most pre-schoolers are more interested with the contents of their toy chest than the catwalks, oneÂ  three-year-old girl loves shoes so much she already owns more than 35 pairs.

Little Amelia Milsom-McQuillan got hooked on shoes after trying on her mothers' heels and parading up and down the hallway at home.

The fashion-mad girl - who wears a size nine - quickly built up an impressive collection worth hundreds of pounds.

At the tender age of three, Amelia Milsom-McQuillan owns 35 pairs of shoes- more than most grown women

All Amelia's friends and family know about her shoe obsession, and buy them for her as birthday and Christmas presents.

Mother Gemma Milsom-McQuillan, 27, says the fashion fan can't walk past fancy footwear in shop windows and spends all her pocket money on them.

Now the 105cm tall youngster has put her best foot forward as a model - stepping out on the catwalk before she's even started school.

She's one of the faces of children's shoes Start-rite and has starred in a fashion show and photoshoot in London.

Mrs Milsom-McQuillan, a mental health worker, said: 'Amelia's always loved shoes ever since she was born.

Despite blossoming modelling career, Amelia has plans to be a doctor when she grows up

'Even as a baby she used to play with mine and my partner Sarah's shoes and put them on to teeter up and down the hall at home.

'Having two mums means there's a lot of shoes in the house to catch her eye.

'Amelia's very girly and is obsessed with shoes already - she loves pink and can't resist anything pink and sparkly.

'As soon as she could walk she started trying all our heels and sandals on.

'Her favourite phrase as a toddler was '" want to try on your wedding shoes", to describe our going-out shoes.

'Her favourites were my red stilletoes and I'll never forget her tottering around in them and almost breaking her neck.

'Amelia's got more than 35 pairs of shoes and whenever we're out shopping and she spots a pair on the shelf she stops me and asks to try them on.

'She's got everything from dressing-up shoes and party shoes to boots and different coloured Converse, all stored in coloured boxes in her bedroom.

'At the moment she adores the Disney film Frozen and so any shoes that look princessy go down a treat.

'All her pocket money and any gift vouchers she's given as presents goes towards her shoe fund.'

Mrs Milsom-McQuillan, from Copnor, Portsmouth, filmed Amelia modelling a pair of silver glittery pumps to enter the competition to be a shoe model.

It caught the judge's eye, and Amelia joined 15 other children for a three-hour modelling session.

Mrs Milsom-McQuillan said her daughter loved twirling around in three different outfits - summer, winter and school.

The mother-of-one said: 'Amelia's always loved the camera so when I saw this opportunity, we went for it.

'Our video was about a minute long and just showed Amelia walking up and down and doing a little pose.

'Amelia loved being a model for the first time - the whole thing was really relaxed and there was no pressure.

'The team put a bit of eye shadow and glitter on the girls so that they felt like they were getting a special treatment.

'They had their pictures taken by a photographer and tried on different outfits and hats while they walked up and down a catwalk.

'Amelia really enjoyed her first taste of modelling, made a new best friend and was delighted when she got a free pair of shoes at the end of the day.'

'She talks about the fashion show a lot and told the staff at her nursery 'I'm a model now, I'm all grown up'.

'That had them in stitches.'

Amelia's parents, Mrs Milsom-McQuillan and her civil partner Sarah, 31, a nurse, say they would be happy for Amelia to return to the catwalk.

But they don't want it to get in the way of her education - the talented girl has set her sights on becoming a doctor.
