Actress Sasha Grey has slammed the Russian propaganda machine after her photograph was used  in a fake story about a nurse 'murdered by Ukrainian soldiers'.

A photo of the 26-year-old former pornstar appeared next to an obituary claiming to be of a Russian nurse captured, raped and killed by Ukrainian military forces, and quickly went viral on social media.

Miss Grey, born Marina Ann Hantzis, retaliated on Twitter, saying that although she loved her Russian fans, the anti-Ukraine propaganda had been taken too far.

Angry: The 26-year-old actress, pictured last year, vented on Twitter after the post, saying Russian propagande had gone 'too far'

The fake story appeared on Russian social network VKontakte and received more than 3,500 likes in 24 hours. 

The 'obituary' claimed a nurse named Sasha Serova, 'serova' being the word for grey in Russian, had been taken captured on the battlefield and held hostage by Kiev forces.

It claims the soldiers filmed themselves 'humiliating' the fictional nurse before murdering and dismembering her with an ax, the Moscow Times reports.

Miss Grey, an American actress who left the adult entertainment industry in 2010, fired back in a series of posts on her Twitter account earlier today. 

'I love my Russian fans, but this propaganda takes it too far. News that I was a NURSE killed in the Russian/Ukraine conflict. #f***propoganda [sic]

'People are dying. People are losing family members & BS outlets mock the deceased with Fappery like this.'

The trolling of 'gullible' Russians by using Sasha Grey's picture and a fake obituary was a 'troll quote'.

A 'troll quote' is an images which sees a popular film or TV quote attributed to the wrong character, designed simply to annoy and frustrate.

A popular 'troll quote' sees a quote from Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore next to an image of Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

She then added that she had been a victim of another fake propaganda story in 2014, when she had been labelled as a supporter of Kiev.

'Just an FYI some other conservative propaganda outlet labeled me & other Russian artists as friends of the Hunta just last summer/fall.

'So to make it clear FIRST I was the ENEMY & now I'm a FRIEND because this was supposedly the fault of Ukrainians.'

In her final tweet about the scandal she added that she has 'love & respect for all of my Russian & Ukrainian fans, I wish there was more I could do. #peace' 

Grey's image and accompanying fake story appears to have been part of a trolling project by users of a Russian version of reddit called 2ch.hk, known as 'Dvach'.

Accused: Miss Grey, seen on Entourage, claimed she had been accused of supporting Kiev in the Russia-Ukraine conflict just last year

Last week, users of the forum launched a project intended to test the 'gullability of Russians', by making up fake stories about 'fallen heroes' and posting them next to images of famous people, Global Voices reports.

For those aware of Miss Grey's background in the adult entertainment industry, the trolling in the 'obituary' is obvious, as it contains several sexually suggestive double entendres, the website says.

Sasha Grey, from North Highlands, California, graduated a year early from high school and waited tables until she had saved up for a move to Los Angeles.

She began appearing in adult films shortly after turning 18 and quickly became one of the most popular female porn stars in the U.S.

During her porn career she appeared in more than 300 films and spoke openly about her choice to embark on a career in adult entertainment at such a young age.

She filmed her last porn film aged 21, but after fearing some fans might still believe her to be an active adult actress she officially announced her retirement shortly after turning 22, in April 2011. 

Miss Grey has since become a mainstream actress, appearing in several films and as a semi-fictionalized version of herself in HBO's Entourage.
