Steven Gerrard may be followed to MLS by his cousin Anthony.

The Huddersfield Town defender is out of contract at the John Smith’s Stadium in the summer and hinted in November that may need to move away.

The 28-year-old former Everton and Cardiff player missed the first few months of the season with a calf injury but has returned to the first-team squad of late.

He is interested in moving Stateside and a few franchises, including Adrian Heath's Orlando, will look into a deal.

Gerrard would not command the salary of his famous cousin so would fit into squad budgets without too much disruption.

The Combine college draft takes place over this weekend while the MLS draft is next week.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Galaxy president Chris Klein says loaning Steven Gerrard to a European club in the MLS off-season has 'never been discussed'.

Gerrard though has expressed an interest in returning to Liverpool's Melwood to maintain his fitness during that time.

Gerrard has been assured that he will be played in a more attacking role when he makes the move to Galaxy
