A man has died after being viciously beaten and stomped on at a homeless shelter for refusing to hand over 75 cents to his attacker.

Joseph Meyers, 53, was taken to hospital on Saturday following the attack at the Toledo Gospel Rescue Mission in Toledo, Ohio.

Meyers, who struggled with alcohol and drug addiction for most of his life, was pronounced dead on Wednesday evening.

Perpetrator Houston Hart, 49, was arrested at the scene and has remained in the Lucas County jail since. He is charged with felonious assault.

Police say they expect murder charges to be presented to a grand jury soon. A judge has set a $100,000 cash-only bond for the man.

The two men were acquaintances who both volunteered at the mission as well as staying there, reports The Blade.

Meyers had been stayed at the mission for 19 months, while Hart had stayed there on-and-off for about six months.

The mission says its goal is to minister to the spiritual and physical needs of the homeless and poor.
