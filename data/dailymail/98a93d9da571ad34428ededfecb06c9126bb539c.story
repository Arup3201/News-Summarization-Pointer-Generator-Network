Though it has been standing empty for years, an eerie presence of days gone by lurks the halls of this derelict care home.

Stacks of filthy mattresses, discarded wheelchairs and old bikes are just some of the reminders of those who once roamed the now silenced corridors.

The south Derbyshire building and its haunting contents were captured by urban explorer photographer, Toby Batchelor, who considers the images a reflection of hard times ahead.

Souvenirs of the past: Bowling pins and buckets of paint are among the many signs of life that haunt the derelict care home in south Derbyshire

Plastic canisters of petrol and fuel stand untouched alongside paint buckets on a rickety shelving unit in the building

Rusty bedside commodes and rotting pipes are a reminder of the frail and needy who would once have received care in the now forgotten building

'These photographs capture the effects of budget cuts, over population and a struggling system.

'The building was once a facility to care for the elderly, which has now been left to rot until someone steps in and buys the property.'

The 34-year-old, whose fascination with forgotten buildings led him to pursue urban exploration, said: 'I am always so intrigued at what gets left behind.

'It's fascinating to think about what it would have once looked like.'

Peeling and chipped walls still bear warnings of health and safety, though an emergency fire alarm is blackened by rot and mould

Dust ridden mattresses are stacked high beside old-fashioned metal headboards while a dated appliance lies rusting among others in a room perhaps once used as a laundry

Dirtied chairs and discarded bedding are tossed beneath rusted window frames. The number of stacked cushions pose a reminder of the many elderly who may have sat in the now squalid room

Mr Batcelor who has also captured a forgotten country cottage, added: 'I think it's sad how buildings like this get knocked down and are remoulded to suit a different purpose.

'I was shocked by the fact that this old people's home is empty when I'm sure there are plenty of people who need this sort of care.

'It seems such a shame that all the old wheel chairs and kitchen equipment are lying there unused.

Discarded bicycles with baskets and satchels attached are some of the items within the home photographer Toby Batchelor feels are going to waste

Leaky ceilings and paint-chipped brick walls form a the many corridors once filled with nurses tasked with providing comfort and care to those who lived there

'It's very interesting to me to see what's left behind; I can imagine it would have been a lovely home in its day.'

In a bid to preserve its historic condition, the photographer wasn't inclined to reveal the building's exact location.

His somber photographs are featured on picture sharing website, Flickr.

His other works include profiles of abandoned hospitals and schools, some of which are due to face demolition.

Urban exploration is a hobby revolving around the exploration of man-made structures.

Abandoned buildings and city ruins are popular focus points, with photography, documentation and film-making playing a significant part in the interest too.

Often involving trespassing and imposing on privacy, urban exploration does pose the risk of arrest as well as one of physical harm.

There are six acknowledged 'targets' for urban exploration:

1. Abandonments

These are the sites most frequently visited by urban explorers and include abandoned buildings or derelict sites such as the care home photographed above.

2. Active buildings

The exploration of in-use or 'active' buildings is another principle of the hobby, though this poses more risk of arrest if the buildings are private. Exploration of active buildings is also referred to as infiltration.

3. Catacombs

Catacombs such as those found in Paris, Rome, Odessa and Naples have been investigated by enthusiasts who call themselves Catapahiles.

The Mines of Paris, comprising much of the underground tunnels that are not open to public tourism like the catacombs, have been considered the 'Holy Grail' by some due to their extensive nature and history.

4. Sewers and storm drains

Entry into storm drains or 'draining' is an increasingly popular branch of urban exploration, with devoted groups forming across the world. Poor weather conditions prevent the activity though, as heavy rainfall could trap explorers in drains causing them to drown.

5. Railway tunnels

Exploring active and abandoned subway and underground railway tunnels, bores and stations is often considered to be trespassing and can therefore result in arrest. As a result this type of exploration is rarely publicised.

6. Utility tunnels

Steam and utility tunnels in hospitals, universities and large buildings used to carry superheated steam are a favourite of some.

Though a considerably more dangerous branch of urban exploration, exploring steam tunnels has been made safer in recent years due to high levels concern for health and safety in institutional buildings.
