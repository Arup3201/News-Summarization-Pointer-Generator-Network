Jonathan Davies believes his Wales team-mate George North can be a dangerous weapon against Australia following his forced switch to outside centre.

An injury to Davies, usually the first choice No 13, prompted head coach Warren Gatland to re-deploy North from the wing to midfield for Saturday’s Test at the Millennium Stadium.

The 22-year-old will line up against Tevita Kuridrani, the in-form Wallaby, but Davies is confident North has all the attributes to make a successful transition.

Jonathan Davies suffered a shoulder injury playing for Clermont Auvergne against Sale Sharks in October 

‘He definitely won’t lack any size,’ Davies told Sportsmail. ‘He played a full Test against France and he was excellent that day. It shows the talent of the player that he can make that transition pretty easily. Everyone’s got confidence in him but I’m 100 per cent sure he’s a better winger than a centre – just to save my job!

‘On the wing you’re slightly more off the front line in defence and you trust your 13 to get there. Likewise, when you’re a 13 you trust your 12 to get there. It is slightly different defensively, but with George’s power and pace he can make up for it.’

Davies is among a group of Welsh players who play their club rugby in France. The 26-year-old joined Clermont Auvergne in the summer and admits he is still finding his feet across The Channel.

He was left out of Clermont’s squad for the opening round of the European Champions Cup, but is still pleased with his decision to move to foreign shores.

‘I don’t have any regrets about moving to France,’ he said. ‘I love it out there and I’m getting pushed by world-class players everyday. I just have to make sure I find that consistency because I haven’t delivered as much as I’d like to.

‘One of the big things when negotiating with Clermont was my desire to continue my Welsh career. They were very understanding and I have full release for the four Tests in November, which I’m very grateful for. It’s a bit of a cloudy area.’

Gatland confirmed on Thursday that all of his France-based players will be available for the final autumn Test against South Africa, having struck a deal with Racing Metro over Luke Charteris. 

‘They are all available,’ said Gatland. ‘We released Luke Charteris back to Racing for this week and he is available for the South African week, so we have done a bit of a deal with them. The other French players are available to us.’
