Controversial baseball legend Pete Rose - who currently is banned from Major League Baseball for life for betting on on games in which his own team was playing - is returning to manage a baseball team, but just for one day.

The 73-year-old Rose, who has the most career hits in major league history, is scheduled to skipper the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League on Monday.

Rose - who is referred to by his fans as 'Charlie Hustle' for his intensity on the field - was managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1989 when he agreed to a lifetime ban from Major League Baseball.

Rose can take this one-game job because the Bluefish are not affiliated with any major league team. He has occasionally appeared at official events since his ban, with MLB's permission.

For years, Rose denied that he had ever bet on baseball, despite a lengthy investigation concluding that he had. 

In 2004, Rose finally admitted that he had bet on baseball, and that he had even bet on the Cincinnati Reds while he was the team's manager. He claims, however, that he never bet against his team.

The admission - which included an apology - came in the form of a book Rose had written, so its sincerity has always been questioned.

Because of the ban, Rose is prohibited from managing in MLB and from being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, which given his incredible statistics, is a very likely scenario if not for his having bet on his own team.

He now lives in Las Vegas and makes money selling his autograph and memorabilia at nearby casinos and sports stores.

Rose, however, is still holding out hope that his ban will be lifted and that he'll be allowed to manage a team and be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

'I've waited 25 years, but I've done so because I was the one who screwed up,' Rose told ESPN.com. 'And if I were given a second chance, I would be the happiest guy in the world.'

In 1997, Rose applied for reinstatement with MLB Comissioner Bud Selig. Selig, who is set to retire in January of 2015, has never ruled on Rose's application.

'I haven't given up on Bud,' Rose said. 'I'm not glad he's leaving. He has a love for the game and has been good for it. If the next guy is his best friend, I don't expect he'll just turn me loose, but if he isn't, I hope he has an open mind.'

Rose - who went to prison in 1990 for tax evasion - is also despised by many baseball fans for a play that happened in the 1970 All Star Game, in which Rose tackled catcher Ray Fosse at the plate.

The game was an exhibition game, and critics say Rose should have just slid into home rather than take out Fosse, who suffered a broken and separated shoulder from the hit, which never completely healed properly.

The Bluefish will host the Lancaster Barnstormers in Rose's game. The team says the Atlantic League is all about giving people second chances.
