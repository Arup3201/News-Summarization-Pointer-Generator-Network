Almost every morning, Rolf Harris turned up at court arm-in-arm with his family.

But behind the show of unity, his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi knew, better than anyone, that his near-saintly public image bore little resemblance to the real Rolf Harris.

Devoted husband? He had an affair with his live-in housekeeper-cum-chauffeur back in the Nineties, which had left Alwen ‘devastated’, it emerged during the trial.

Loving father? We now know he abused his daughter’s best friend from the age of 13 in the late Seventies and early Eighties.

Harris had told Bindi that the ‘relationship’ started when the girl was 18, not 13. When she went into the witness stand to give evidence for him, Bindi told the court she believed him.

But what daughter would want to believe their own father was guilty not just of adultery with her best friend, but of something much worse as well? So Bindi - and her mother - stood by him.

From the very start, though, the daily show of ‘family unity’ looked suspiciously choreographed.

Under cross examination, the jury learnt that the limousine bringing Harris and his wife to court stopped en route at a local cafe each day to pick up Bindi, so they could all arrive together.

It was all for the benefit of the assembled TV crews and photographers. Proof, maybe, that the camera does sometimes lie.

Harris’s
 complex relationship with his wife and daughter, and their sometimes 
unconventional behaviour, was the sub-plot to the case. Alwen, 82, a 
sculptress and jewellery-maker in her heyday, sat in the public gallery 
with other members of the family, just yards from her husband.

She had to listen as his reputation - and, by implication, their 56-year marriage - was dismantled allegation by allegation.

After one especially harrowing day of evidence, she allowed him to step straight from the dock and kiss her on the lips.

Only once did Alwen show any visible sign of emotion. When the jury was told about Harris’s fling with the housekeeper, Alwen appeared to wipe away a tear.

Her eccentric streak was apparent from the first day, when she brought a novelty cushion (featuring the face of a gerbil-like creature wearing a crown) to sit on.

It was as if to say she was the same Alwen who, in her younger days, chose her pet poodle to be a bridesmaid at her wedding.

Bindi Nicholls — as she is now — was only allowed to take her place sitting near her mother in court once she had testified (her mother did not give evidence).

During his summing up, the judge reminded the jury of the testimony of Mrs Nicholls’ childhood friend by referring to the victim’s statement:  ‘He hugged and tickled me. It was creepy’ … ‘He walked his fingers up my back’ … ‘His hand went inside the towel’ … ‘He spat on his fingers’ [before indecently assaulting the girl].

From 50-year-old Mrs Nicholls, herself an artist, there was not the slightest reaction; not a shake of the head nor the hint of an anguished expression. Nothing. She looked like a disinterested spectator, constantly fiddling with her mobile phone on her lap.

Indeed, there were times during the trial when Mrs Nicholls appeared to be trying too hard to act normally.

Once, she wore a bright red flower in her hair; on another occasion, an almost fluorescent yellow scarf with black polka dots. Before she gave evidence, she could often be found in the canteen with her headphones on.

During breaks in the proceedings, Rolf Harris became a ‘father’ and ‘husband’ again, joining his wife, daughter, other relatives and his agent in the waiting room outside Court Two, or in the canteen. At least two private security guards hovered in the background.

Alwen and Bindi have always shunned the limelight, so the past few weeks must have been particularly painful. In one way or another, though, they have been victims of Harris’s stardom all their lives.

Her husband’s non-stop work schedule left Alwen desperately lonely, particularly during the early years of their marriage, prompting her to confide in her diary: ‘I feel like killing myself, I’m so bored.’

In his 2001 autobiography, Harris says he only discovered how unhappy she was when, many years later, he found her old diary.

‘I had been so absorbed in my own career … that I had totally forgotten about Alwen. I am crying inside now as I write this.’

He recalled how he’d boarded a plane to go on a tour of the U.S. within a few hours of Bindi’s birth: ‘Right up until the last minute, Alwen expected me to cancel,’ he admitted.

We now know that his failings went much deeper than merely putting his career first.

Even so, his celebrity and long absences had a devastating effect on his daughter. In a rare interview more than a decade ago, Mrs Nicholls spoke about being desperately lonely as a child when her father was away.

‘I would be sitting on people’s doorsteps saying: “Can I play with you?” and, until recently, had never even displayed a picture of him in the house because of the inevitable reaction from visitors.

‘The conversation would go straight to my father and I’d think: “Oh, no, not again.”’

Mrs Nicholls, who has an 18-year-old son from a previous relationship, now lives in north London with her husband, Craig Nicholls.

When she gave evidence, she said she was still having counselling to deal with the legacy of her relationship with her father.

‘It is really difficult having to be the daughter of a famous man, having to be the single child and dealing with that all on your own,’ she said.

She said she had come to terms with his ‘affair’ with her best friend after finding out about it from the girl herself in 1997.

But that was when she — and her mother — thought the relationship began when her friend was a young woman, not still a child.
