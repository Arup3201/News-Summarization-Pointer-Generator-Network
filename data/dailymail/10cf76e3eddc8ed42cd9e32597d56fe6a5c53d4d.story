A 3-year-old boy is dead after his parents mistakenly left him in a hot car in Florida over the weekend. dding to the tragedy, the parents were attending a funeral for another family member when the little boy was accidentally left in the car.

According to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office, Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead after spending about three hours in the back of a hot car as his parents attended the funeral - and his two siblings were just feet away in the care of a babysitter.

Tragedy: This is the Florida home where Kyrese Anderson, 3, died after his parents accidentally left him in a hot car for four hours while they went to the funeral of another family member

The confusion, the sheriff's office says, started when the baby's parents, Robert Anderson, 29, and Amanda Jo Anderson, 30, took two cars to drop their children off with a babysitter about 1 p.m.

The two older children - ages 4 and 5 - were in one of the vehicles, as Kyrese was in the other.

The Andersons dropped the two older kids off with the babysitter but forgot about Kyrese. They then took one car to the funeral and left the other - the one containing the boy - in front of the babysitter's house, as the hot, mid-day sun beat down upon it.

Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend to happen in places with warmer climates like the southwest and Florida

'They get back from the funeral several hours later,' Dave Bristow with 
the Manatee County Sheriff's Office told WTSP.com, 'and they ask where the 
3-year-old was, and the babysitter said, "I thought he was with you?'"

The couple rushed to the car and found the baby unresponsive inside at about 4 p.m. and called 9-1-1.

Kyrese was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tends to happen, as one would imagine, more frequently in places with warmer climates, like the southwest and Florida.

According to the website KidsandCars.org, 33 children were killed in the U.S. when they were left in hot cars in 2011. That's down from 49 in 2010.

The table shows non-traffic fatalities amongst children and shows that there were 613 heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2011

The group suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it.

The group also suggests putting a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back.

Additionally, the group suggests parents get in the habit of always opening a rear door when they reach a destination - the group calls this ' look before you lock.'

Investigators are awaiting autopsy results to determine Kyrese's cause of death. No charges have been filed against the parents.
