Chris Grayling has accused his opponents of being out of touch with the ‘wishes of the country’, as Tory plans to end the meddling of the European Court of Human Rights came under ferocious attack.

The Justice Secretary faced down criticism of his proposal to allow Britain to ignore rulings by the Strasbourg court from the Lib Dems, ex-Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve and former justice secretary Ken Clarke.

Labour went so far as to warn that the Tories wished to put Britain on a par with Belarus – which commits human rights abuses and imposes the death penalty.

Meanwhile the ECHR indicated Mr Grayling’s plan to restore the sovereignty of the British Parliament and our courts would not be acceptable. The Council of Europe, which oversees the Strasbourg court, said: ‘As they stand, the proposals are not consistent with the ECHR.’

This immediate rejection of the plans will harden attitudes and could push Britain one step closer to proposing an exit from the court if the Tories win a Parliamentary majority in May.

Mr Grayling, who repeated his threat to quit the ECHR if Strasbourg does not agree to the changes, was defiant.

The plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and Dominic Grieve QC, who was sacked by David Cameron in the summer reshuffle

He said: ‘Politicians should reflect the wishes of the country. I do not claim to understand why the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are opposed to change. The vast majority – 80, 90 per cent of the public – support this change.’

As the Mail revealed yesterday, the Tories will make a manifesto commitment to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.

Instead of being bound by rulings from the European Court, it will serve in an ‘advisory’ capacity.

Any verdict which was not in Britain’s interests could be rejected by MPs in a Parliamentary vote.

As expected, the plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and Mr Grieve QC, who was sacked by David Cameron in the summer reshuffle.

Mr Grieve said it was ‘laughable’ that Britain would be able to negotiate its own set of rules with Strasbourg and criticised the plans as ‘almost puerile’. He told The Guardian: ‘I also think they are unworkable and will damage the UK’s international reputation.’

The Council of Europe said it was ‘inconceivable’ that the UK, as a founding member, could leave the court, he said.

He claimed the Tory proposals ‘lack any maturity’, complaining: ‘How can the UK obtain such a status when other countries have signed up to an agreement collectively to implement judgments?’

But Tory sources pointed out that, while he was still serving on the Conservative front bench, Mr Grieve had appeared to take a different position – supporting the idea MPs could vote against the European Court’s demand for prisoners to be granted the vote.

In 2009, Mr Grieve said: ‘The Government must allow a Parliamentary debate which gives MPs the opportunity to insist on retaining our existing practice that convicted prisoners can’t vote.’

Four years earlier, when the verdict on prisoner voting was first handed down, the QC said of the Court: ‘Why should they have a say in how that society is run?’

Mr Clarke said he found the idea of giving MPs a veto on rulings by the court ‘rather bewildering’. He said the Russian government would ‘welcome the idea’ that its Parliament could set them all aside.

Russian membership of the human rights body has continued despite Moscow’s arming of separatist rebels and effective invasion of Ukraine this year.

Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat justice minister, indicated the move was an attempt to counter the threat from Ukip.

He said: ‘The Conservatives don’t care about the rights of British citizens – they care about losing to Ukip. These plans make no sense: you can’t protect the human rights of Brits and pull out of the system that protects them.

‘We will not allow the Tories to take away the hard-won human rights of British people when in the UK or anywhere else in Europe.’

There was also anger about Labour’s claim that, if Britain no longer falls under the jurisdiction of Strasbourg, it will be ‘in the same bracket as Belarus, Europe’s last remaining dictatorship’.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘For Labour to suggest Britain would descend to Belarus without their Human Rights Act shows a wanton lack of moral clarity.’

Belarus is widely condemned as an authoritarian dictatorship with tight restrictions on freedoms of speech, association and regular crackdowns on dissent.

Britain, by contrast, invented modern Parliamentary democracy, has a centuries old tradition of civil and political rights and a strong, independent Press and judiciary.
