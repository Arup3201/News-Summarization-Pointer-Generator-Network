Ajax captain Siem de Jong has signed for Newcastle United for £6million on a six-year deal.

The Holland international has been on Alan Pardew's wishlist for over two years and the Newcastle boss will be delighted to finally land his man.

De Jong, whose younger brother Luuk had an inauspicious loan spell at St James' last season, is Pardew's second signing of the summer after Tenerife's Ayoze Perez.

'It is great to have signed for Newcastle,' De Jong said.

'It is a big club which my brother told me all about, so I already feel good here. I had been at Ajax a long time and wanted a new challenge in a new environment and a new country.

'Coming to Newcastle is a great opportunity and the chance to play for a club like this in the Premier League was one I could not turn down.

'I am looking forward to starting training and meeting my new teammates and hopefully we can have a successful season.'

Newcastle have sorely missed Yohan Cabaye
 following his sale to Paris St Germain and de Jong can fulfill the 
playmaker role as well as that of a second striker.

De Jong's younger
 brother Luuk is unlikely to return from Borussia Monchengladbach.
