A council has come under fire after sending tenants an 'insulting' newsletter telling them to set aside money for court fine, cigarettes, Sky TV and lottery tickets.

Crawley Borough Council sent the advice in a leaflet to thousands of council housing tenants - who reacted with fury at being treated like 'beer-swilling chavs' like TV's Frank Gallagher.

The newsletter, which includes a reminder to residents that they have to pay their rent and council tax, was slammed by locals in the Sussex town as 'an insult' offering patronising advice.

Leaflet: Crawley Borough Council told residents to save money for court fines and lottery tickets

The 12-page bulletin features a section titled 'Take control of your money', which states: 'Working out your budget is all about looking at what money you've got coming in and what you are spending.'

It tells tenants to list all their expenditure, adding: 'Some things are more important than others so make sure you put these first.

'You need to pay your rent or you could lose your home. Electricity and gas bills need paying so you don't get cut off. If you don't pay your council tax you could go to prison. Court fines need paying too.'

In a list of costs which could be incurred by tenants, the council mentions Sky or cable TV, lotteries, magistrates' court fines, cigarettes, tobacco, alcohol, haircuts and child maintenance payments.

Anger: Residents claimed they were treated like Frank Gallagher, the layabout father from TV's Shameless

Local Will Davies, 28, said: 'The newsletter makes it sound like every council tenant is like Frank Gallagher in Shameless.

'Not everyone sits about watching Sky TV with a fag and a can of booze just waiting around until they have to go to court.

'The simple fact that the council included these items just goes to show what they think of their tenants - they think they're just chavs.'

Another resident, Sarah Jarman, 41, said: 'This newsletter is an insult to everyone who lives in the town.

'We are not beer-swilling chavs waiting for a Lotto ticket to come in, but that's obviously what the council think of us.'

Stephen Joyce, the Labour councillor responsible for housing, said that he would look into how the tactless newsletter came to be distributed.

'It doesn't sound right,' he said. 'If the entry for magistrates' court fines had been pointed out to me I would have queried it at the time. I also wouldn't be encouraging them to put money aside for cigarettes.'

Councillor Duncan Crow, leader of the Conservative opposition, said the advice was 'inappropriate' and painted council tenants in a harsh light.

'It just struck me as being somewhat odd and, to be frank, rather insulting to suggest that falling foul of the law is a part of everyday life for our council tenants,' he said.

A council spokesman said the advice was 'standard debt and budgeting advice', adding: 'There are lots of things in the list that will not apply to many council tenants but the list helps them to prioritise the most important payments.'
