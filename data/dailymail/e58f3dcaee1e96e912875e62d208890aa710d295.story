City dwellers have noticed emboldened foxes for years.

But now a new study claims that humans and the urban environments that they have created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders, the shrinking of fish  and the emergence of birds with no fear of man.

And the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘may have significant implications for ecological and human well-being,’ according to one expert.

A new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence. For example, Pacific salmon (b) have become smaller, blackbirds (d) have changed their migratory behaviour, Crespis sancta (e) disperses less seeds in built-up areas, earthworms (f) have become tolerant to metal, while white-footed mice in New York are carrying more ticks, leading to increased cases of Lyme Disease in humans

Maria Alberti, of the University of Washington College of Built Environments, said that until recently, it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately.

‘We now have evidence that there is rapid evolution. These changes may affect the state of the environment now. This is what's called eco-evolutionary feedback,’ she said.

Professor Alberti explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased, but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly.

She has reviewed evidence of ‘human signatures’ - or examples of changes in fish, birds, mammals and plants - caused by man in her study, which is published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution.

Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia discovered that golden orb weaver spiders (stock image is shown) living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame

‘Many species of mammals, birds, fishes, and insects have learned novel behaviours, such as diet, foraging skills, and anti-predator behaviour,’ the study says.

For example, it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that Pacific salmon have become smaller in urban areas.

In contrast, a study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments.

Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia discovered that golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame.

Professor Alberti said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ecosystem functions such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, detoxification, food production and ultimately on human health and well-being.’

In addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon, she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively.

A study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments.

Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia, discovered that golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. 

'Our findings show the impact urbanisation can have on local wildlife,' said said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney. 

'While many species do not survive encroaching urbanisation and the consequent loss of native habitat, others have a more complex relationship with man-made changes to the landscape.'

The researchers collected golden orb-weaving spiders (Nephila plumipes) from across the Sydney city region. 

'We quantified the degree of urbanisation of 20 sites then looked at changes in the spiders' body size, fat reserves and ovary weight,' Ms Lowe said.

The results show spiders in areas with more vegetation cover had smaller bodies and larger bodies when located in urbanised areas.

The authors also found that the spiders' reproductive ability, measured by increased ovary weight, appeared to increase in urban areas.

Earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates, including arsenic, and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities.

The study mentions research that found the weed Crepis sancta disperses a significantly lower proportion of its seeds in urban patches than in undisturbed surroundings and that the seeds of Mycelis muralis are less able to disperse by wind in cities.

Worryingly, the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse, that may have health consequences for humans.

Some white-footed mice in New York were found to be a ‘critical host’ for black-legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.

The 2013 study by researchers from the Universities of New York, Fordham and Connecticut Storrs, was the first to report changes to genes as the result of humans and urbanisation.

Professor Alberti’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness.

It also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder, as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background.

For example, Great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments.

The shapes of songbirds’ wings has even evolved in response to forest fragmentation in North America, according to research by Laval University, Quebec and Cornell University in New York. 

Great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments, while European blackbirds have become more sedentary

European blackbirds have been found to be becoming sedentary and have changed their migratory behaviour in response to urbanisation. 

Professor Alberti said that humans in cities cause the changes in a number of ways.

For example, cities disrupt vegetation patterns, create toxic pollutants and increase the temperature, meaning that animals have to adapt rapidly to survive.

Noise and light pollution can also drive change in animal behaviour, while the presence of humans changes the availability of resources such as food and water, altering the life cycle of many species.

The study says: ‘Humans are major selective agents with potential for unprecedented evolutionary consequences for Earth’s ecosystems, especially as cities expand rapidly.’

While the research may seem bleak, Professor Alberti does not have a ‘catastrophic’ perspective but says her work highlights that humans have a unique opportunity to shape the evolution of the Earth.

‘We can drive urbanising ecosystems to collapse or we can consciously steer them toward a resilient and sustainable future,’ she said.
