Manchester City would be boasting Gary Cahill in their ranks for Tuesday's last chance saloon against Bayern Munich had the club not pulled the plug on a deal three years ago.

Cahill, then at Bolton, was subject of a £17.5million offer from the Premier League champions, with Dedryck Boyata going in the opposite direction.

But according to his former boss Owen Coyle, City opted against spending that much on the central defender, who Chelsea then went on to sign for half the price.

Former Bolton manager Owen Coyle asserts that City pulled the plug on any deal for the defender 

It now appears a galling oversight given the defensive problems taking hold at the Etihad Stadium and Cahill's rise to prominence. Neither Martin Demichelis or Eliaquim Mangala look to be capable of performing dependably at the very top, while captain Vincent Kompany hasn't been exempt from criticism this season.

Cahill, Coyle asserts, would have been a perfect fit in Manchester.

'He has everything,' he told Sky Sports News. 'In terms of skills as a footballer, he has pace, power, he has two great feet. And with being a top class defender, he weighs in goals as well.'

Cahill has become a mainstay alongside John Terry for the Blues and is England's most consistent centre-half under Roy Hodgson.

The 28-year-old, however, was ready to seal a move to Roberto Mancini's side until the late change of heart.

It isn't the first time Coyle has decided to pinpoint City's missed opportunity.

'The summer before he moved to Chelsea, Manchester City came in and offered £17 million and a player. That was going to be a huge deal. Obviously, something happened, so he stayed on at Bolton and it never materialised,' he said in March.

'Come the following January in 2012, when it was Chelsea who came in, it was the right thing for him, no doubt.

'They got absolutely got a bargain at £7million. We were at the wrong end of the table and caught up in a battle but I'd always said we would do right by him and give him his chance.'
