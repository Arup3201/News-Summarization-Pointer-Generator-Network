Arsenal are prepared to spend another £20million in the January transfer market.

The areas they are particularly scouting for are centre half, defensive midfield and left back. They will weigh up marquee players, budget ones and those with potential.

Here Sportsmail highlights just how much bang for his buck Arsene Wenger may be able to find.

Arsene Wenger knows his defence needs reinforcements but he is working on a tight budget in January

WINSTON REID (West Ham) Cost £8m

West Ham do not want to sell Reid in January and disrupt their promising season. He is out of contract in the summer but the £8m price tag will reflect their desire to keep him. 

Not a typical Arsenal player but has Premier League experience, wants to defend and is a threat at set-pieces, which the Gunners have been lacking.

Winston Reid would not be a cheap solution, but he has the benefit of Premier League experience

Reid has been excellent for West Ham over the past few seasons, and his power in the air would be vital

SAMI KHEDIRA (Real Madrid) £6m

Khedira is a player that could change Arsenal’s future and is vastly experienced despite still only being 27.

Madrid will consider selling in January if he continually stalls on a new contract and have already targeted his compatriot Christoph Kramer, 23, of Bayer Leverkusen.

All the big clubs are interested and big wages are an issue - but they should be worth paying. 

Adding World Cup-winning midfielder Sami Khedira would be a massive boost for Arsenal in January

The Real star would be available for the cut price of £6million, but his wages might be a sticking point

MARCELO BROZOVIC (Dinamo Zagreb) Cost £6.5m

Talks have been opened with the midfielder’s agents and they are hopeful of agreeing a deal with Arsenal but decisions don’t come quickly at the Emirates.

Brozovic has played as a playmaker and attacking midfielder but the Gunners believe he can play a more defensive role. Room for improvement at 21 and cheaper than William Carvalho at Sporting.

Marcelo Brozovic is already in talks with the Gunners, but it remains to be seen if the deal gets done in January

MATIJA NASTASIC (Manchester City) Cost £12million

Arsenal have made enquiries for Nastasic and City will sell at the right price as they are actively looking for another centre back themselves in anticipation the Serbia defender will leave.

There is interest from Italy also with Inter Milan and Juventus among his admirers. Would fit into Arsenal’s style.

RON VLAAR (Aston Villa) Cost £12m

Vlaar may be out of contract next summer but the price again reflects Villa’s dire need to keep him. 

Arsenal will also face competition from Southampton, Manchester United and Tottenham, who are weighing up defensive changes. 

Vlaar has the ability and physical presence to fit in comfortably at the Emirates.

CHRIS SMALLING (Man Utd) Cost £16m

Manchester United refused to sell Smalling to Arsenal in the summer and will not let the England centre half go at this stage either with a lack of defensive cover.

It is fair to say that Louis van Gaal is continually taking stock of his defenders and Smalling’s injury record continues to hinder his development.

Chris Smalling was sent off in last month's Manchester derby, but is still not central to Louis van Gaal's plans

Arsenal have enquired about Smalling before but with United lacking cover, he won't be allowed to leave

VIRGIL VAN DIJK (Celtic) Cost £8m

Has impressed in Scotland and during Celtic’s European campaigns but there are doubts whether he is at the level to seriously improve upon Arsenal’s deficiencies. 

He is good on the ball and scores goals but may lack the extra quality to make a difference to their current squad.

Celtic's Virgil van Dijk has an eye for goal and has impressed in domestic and European football

There remain questions over whether Van Dijk would dramatically improve Arsenal's options

TYRONE MINGS (Ipswich Town) Cost £7m

Tall, powerful looking left back who has caught the eye of a number of Premier League scouts and was the subject of a bid from Crystal Palace in August.

He continues to impress at Ipswich and has good character and potential to switch to centre back.

Very good potential but not quite ready. 

Tyrone Mings has impressed during his time at Ipswich, but is still a prospect rather than a ready-made star

GIANNELLI IMBULA (Marseille) £20m

Arsenal have been joined at the hip by Chelsea scouts at most of Imbula’s games since he made his breakthrough at Guingamp. 

Powerful presence who can dominate midfield but Marseille’s prised possession won’t come cheap. 

Wenger also looked at 19-year-old clubmate Stephane Sparagna who is out of contract soon but injuries have dogged him.

Arsenal have been watching Imbula closely, but could face competition from the likes of Chelsea

Imbula is a powerful midfielder, but is likely to cost Arsenal all of their £20million budget in January

ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE (Lyon) £15m

Arsenal don’t need a striker but that hasn’t stopped them looking at Lyon’s Lacazette who is the top scorer in France with 11 goals. 

A target for Newcastle and Liverpool, he has also been watched by Tottenham in recent weeks. 

Ready-made for Arsenal but only really required should they sell. 

Alexandre Lacazatte has been superb so far this season in France, but do Arsenal need another forward?

ONE TO PONDER...

AYMERIC LAPORTE (Athletic Bilbao) Cost £34m (buy-out clause)

Stylish centre back with plenty of admirers. French-born but has been in Bilbao’s youth system since the age of 16. Still raw but plenty of potential.

Manchester United and Barcelona are contemplating bids but Bilbao will not negotiate - it’s buy-out clause only and that will keep Arsenal at bay for now.
