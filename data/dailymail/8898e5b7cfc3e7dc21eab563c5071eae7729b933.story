Channel 5's Big Brother reality shows have sparked the most complaints to TV watchdog Ofcom this year - almost 1,500.

The year's ten most complained about programmes have outraged almost 5,000 viewers in all so far. But as yet, Ofcom has taken hardly any action over the most controversial screened incidents.

The June series of Big Brother triggered 965 complaints and August's Celebrity Big Brother a further 438.

Complaints: Courtney Stodden is evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire

Racy: Lady Gaga's performance on the X Factor helped make the show the second most complained about TV programme of 2013

Viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an ‘unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type.

Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly accused of racism'.

Slade had said: 'I do go for younger guys, generally. I go for darker looking, not black, but darker features, more like Mediterranean.'

Big Brother said her language was 'unacceptable and potentially offensive'. A further 244 viewers complained that Gina Rio had bullied fellow housemate Hazel O'Sullivan.

Rio shouted at the Irish model: 'You're a pain in the a**e, a homewrecking whore, a dirty a**e skank, an ugly and disgusting cheap little tart.'

And another 166 viewers complained to Ofcom over scenes shown of boxer Daley Ojuederie fighting with O'Sullivan.

Sixth in the list of most complained about shows was ITV's Britain's Got Talent with 422

Shocking: The murder of Emmerdale
character Gennie Sharma sparked a flurry of complaints

Ojuederie was removed from the 
Hertfordshire house for what Big Brother branded 'threatening and 
aggressive behaviour' towards O'Sullivan.

He
had slapping her bottom and clasped his hands around her neck while 
they were on a bed. Ofcom is currently investigating all three 
controversial incidents and will publish its findings in the New Year.

Celebrity Big Brother also courted controversy amid claims of ‘animal cruelty' on the show.

Viewers complained after they watched U.S. reality TV star Courtney Stodden put her toy, stuffed bunny rabbit through a mangle.

It
is not the first time that the Big Brother shows have faced potential 
action from Ofcom. The 2012 Big Brother series also ran into trouble 
with the organisation over claims of bullying.

Controversial: Rowan Atkinson as the Archbishop of Canterbury, backstage at the filming of his sketch for Comic Relief 2013

More than 1,000 viewers complained about Conor McIntyre's expletive-laden tirade at fellow contestant Deana Uppal.

He raged: at her: 'Get your epilator and stick it up your a**e. We don't give a f**k! Stick it up her f**king m**ge, stupid b**tard.'

He later added: 'I'm gonna play loads of pranks on her. F**king piece of s**t, I don't give a f**k if I'm pulled up to the Diary Room.'

ITV talent show X Factor was the second most complained about programme so far this year.

Ofcom received 734 complaints about the series with 317 sparked by Lady Gaga's racy performance on a results show in October.

She writhed around on stage in a nude-coloured bra and pants to her songs ‘Venus' and ‘Do What U Want'. But Ofcom ruled that her saucy antics had not breached the Broadcasting Code.

BBC News was the eighth most complained about programme in 2013, with 354 complaints. Sophie Raworth is the BBC newsreader pictured here

Ninth was ITV drama Downton Abbey with 252 complaints, 246 of which related to the rape of Joanne Froggatt's character, lady's maid Anna May Bates

Completing the top ten list of shame was ITV soap Coronation Street, which attracted 225 complaints over the year

Ofcom also took no action when Louis 
Walsh's dramatic change of heart sparked the most complaints - 1,345 - 
to Ofcom of any TV incident in 2012.

A
producer was seen whispering in his ear during a live sing-off and 
Walsh then sent Carolynne Poole packing instead of rival Rylan Clarke.

Ofcom
ruled that viewers knew that the ultimate decision to eliminate 
contestants or force a 'deadlock' situation 'rests with the judges'.

ITV News was the third most complained about programme this year. Its coverage resulted in 574 complaints, 278 of them over graphic footage showing the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May.

The single most complained about TV incident so far this year was Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of the Archbishop of Canterbury on Comic Relief in March.

Atkinson's foul-mouthed parody sketch attracted 487 complaints - but again Ofcom ruled that it was not unduly offensive.

The BBC's ‘Comic Relief: Funny for Money' programme was the fourth most complained about show of 2013 with 492 upset viewers in all.

Next came the Celebrity Big Brother series with 438 complaints. Sixth was ITV show Britain's Got Talent during 2013 with 422.

Of these, 162 of these related to a risque performance by pop star Jennifer Lopez but Ofcom decided against investigating it.

ITV soap Emmerdale prompted 376, of which 193 were about the murder of character Gennie Sharma before the 9pm watershed.

Serial killer Cameron Murray was shown smothering her with his bare hands but Ofcom ruled the coverage was not in breach. Eighth was BBC News with coverage generating 354 complaints over the year.

Ninth was ITV drama Downton Abbey with 252 complaints, 246 of which related to the rape of Joanne Froggatt's character, lady's maid Anna May Bates.

Ofcom decided not to investigate and said the rape was justified by the context in which it was screened.

Completing the top ten list of shame was ITV soap Coronation Street, which attracted 225 complaints over the year.
