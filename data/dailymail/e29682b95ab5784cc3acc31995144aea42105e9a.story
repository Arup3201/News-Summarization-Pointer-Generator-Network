Bayern Munich are keen to extend the contract of their coach Pep Guardiola, although chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge insists there is no rush.

Guardiola is contracted to the Bavarians until 2016 but talks have not yet commenced about a renewal.

That is because Rummenigge does not expect Guardiola to commit so soon, even though he remains optimistic that the Catalan will have a long and prosperous future with the record German champions.

'He's the best coach Bayern Munich could have had,' Rummenigge said. 'He's also a wonderful person and it's a great pleasure to work with him.

'I hope he stays a long time with us. I know him and I know he is not the sort of person who likes to renew his contract early or places much value in a long-term contract.

'I would only get on his nerves if I were to ask him now. I know when I need to seek talks and that's not going to happen in the very near future because he doesn't want that.

They are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League and among the favourites to reach the final for the third time in four years.Â
