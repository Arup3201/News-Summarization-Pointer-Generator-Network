A selection of vintage chocolate and sweets wrappers will be used to help trigger memories among dementia sufferers.

Historians at Rowntree's have placed a selection of packaging online in the hope patients may view them and reminisce.

Scientists believe the syndrome does not affect long term as much as short term memory and 
discussing the past could engage a sufferer in 
conversation.

Back in time: A selection of vintage chocolate and sweets wrappers, such as 1920s Aero pictured, will be posted online to help trigger memories for dementia sufferers

Old favourites: The collection will include numerous classic sweets such as Fruit Gums, pictured

What a treat: Dairy Box packaging, circa 1920. Discussing the past may help patients engage in conversation

The earliest examples of packaging dates from the 1920s and includes the first wrappers for Aero, Dairy Box, and Fruit Gums.

The document, produced from archives, contains products that longer exist such as Chocolate Pie, which sold for two shillings and Chocolate Cream Squares, which cost six shillings.

Also included is an image of Motoring Chocolate, launched in the 1920s as an energy boost for car drivers.

Production: Rowntrees motoring chocolate, which is no longer being made, will feature in the collection. It is hoped patients will see the packaging and reminisce

The bar was also produced with a plain variety and an almond and raisin sort, which was billed as a way to stop motorists ‘feeling thirsty’ on a trip.

The collection includes packing from old kitchen favourites, including Carnation Evaporated milk and Nestle’s powder coffee from the 1950s.

The makers of the pack hope carers of dementia sufferers will cut out the labels and stick them on top of current chocolate bars and kitchen essentials. It is thought this could also help to spark some old memories.

Advert: Some early advertising for 'Ideal' milk was kept by the company's archivists

Vintage: A Chocolate Pie, which would have cost two shillings in the 1920s, wrapper

Sweet: Vintage Full cream condensed by Nestle - which now owns Rowntree's

Alex Hutchinson, an archivist at Nestle, which now owns Rowntree's, said: 'We came up with this idea because lots of people started asking us for old photographs.

'The different groups and charities wanted the pictures to help dementia sufferers, as looking at an old picture can bring up a memory.

'We thought about other archive material we had and came up with a pack of wrappers, tins, and games that could offer a range of sensory experiences.

'We selected a range that were the most interesting and varied, in the hope that even if a memory wasn’t conjured up, they would still enjoy looking at them and talking about it.

Tasty: Chocolate Cream Squares by Rowntree would have been sold for six shillings

Kitchen classic: A condensed milk wrapper, which would have been found in many kitchens in the 20s

Moving times: A more vibrant wrapper for evaporated milk from the 1950s

'Day to day tasks can become difficult for a dementia sufferer but they are still able to remember past times and their happy experiences.

'The pack has been produced as a pdf file so that anyone can have access to it.'It comes with posters, photographs, and wrappers to print out and bend around chocolate bars so they look like how they would have more than 60 years ago.

'We have included things like the Aero wrapper, which is how it would have looked in 1935 before it ceased production during the Second World War.

Instant: Nescafe coffee powder from the 1950s will be included in the pack

Colourful: A Nesquik raspberry milk wrapper - minus the famous rabbit used nowadays

'There is also an example of a bar of Motoring Chocolate which was developed in the 1920s, it was thought that it would increase the energy of the driver on a car journey.

'There was also an almond and raisin variety that was supposed to stop drivers getting thirsty on a journey.

'Along with these labels, we have included others like condensed and beef extract jelly and we hope that these image will rekindle some memories for dementia sufferers.'

Gravy: Packaging from granulated beef extract jelly circa the 1950s will also feature
