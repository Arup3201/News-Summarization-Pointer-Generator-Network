A driver has plunged to her death after reversing off the top of a multi-storey car park in China.

Businesswoman Lin Yang, 33, was trying to park when her foot slipped on the clutch, sending the sports car through a barricade and off the edge of the third floor of the building in Chenggong city in southwest China's Yunnan province.

An eye witness has described how the car flew off the edge of the car park. 

Tragic: Lin Yang's foot slipped on the clutch and she plunged to her death. Police say it was an accident

Top floor: The businesswoman was trying to park on the top floor of the car park in Chenggong city in southwest China's Yunnan province

Fai Lin, 34, said: 'I was driving up to the car park when I suddenly saw a car come flying over the edge and crash to pieces on the ground.

'I was absolutely shocked and ran over to see if I could help.

'But the woman was clearly dead.'

A police spokesman said: 'A post mortem examination revealed the woman hadn't been drinking and security video footage shows it wasn't intentional, so we can rule out suicide.

'The car owner was attempting to reverse when the car suddenly lurched backwards and disappeared over the edge.

'It is tragic but it seems clear that this was down to human error.'

Accidental: A post mortem examination revealed the woman had not been drinking and security video footage reveals it was not intentional

Legal action: Grieving husband Lin Li is suing the building's owners because 'barricades are supposed to be there to stop cars falling over the edge'

However, the dead woman's distraught husband is suing the building's owners.

Grieving Lin Li, 35, said: 'Barricades are supposed to be there to stop cars falling over the edge.

'But these ones are made of wire with a thin strip of concrete which is completely insane. 

'How many more will die before they realise this?'

A spokesman said: 'We are looking into the tragic accident and our thoughts are with the woman's family.'
