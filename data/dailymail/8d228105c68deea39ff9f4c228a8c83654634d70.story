Andy Murray crashed out of Wimbledon in the quarter-finals after suffering a mini-meltdown on Centre Court, where spectators heard two X-rated rants seemingly aimed at his own team.

Murray, who had cruised through the opening rounds without losing a set, made 37 unforced errors during his shock straight-sets defeat. Even his opponent and friend Grigor Dimitrov claimed he did not seem himself as they warmed up before the match.

The 23-year-old Bulgarian said: ‘As soon as we started to warm up I sensed that his game was not at the highest level.’

In the second set, Murray was heard to bark ‘shut the f**** up’, seemingly towards his own team. As he fell 4-2 down in the third set, he was heard shouting ‘five minutes before the f****** match’, in the direction of the players’ box.

On Wednesday night, his agent said he was not aware of anything happening five minutes before the match which could have thrown him off his game. The loss ended a 17-match winning streak at Wimbledon.

Dimitrov, who is 13th in the world, was later asked why he felt fifth seed Murray was out of sorts during the warm-up.

He said: ‘It’s just a feeling. I have practised quite a few times with him and I know how he is striking the ball when he is at his best.

‘I know how he is playing when he is not at his best. I felt something was a little different and I just had to go with the flow.’
