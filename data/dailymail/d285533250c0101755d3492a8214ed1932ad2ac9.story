Residents in a rural Texas neighborhood have expressed their outrage over a shooting range that allows gunmen to fire hundreds of bullets while dangling from a helicopter near their homes.

Homeowners in Denton County, North Texas said the helicopter and gunfire disrupts the tranquil area and they fear that a bullet could ricochet into one of their homes, causing serious damage.

Helicopter Sniper Adventure offers customers the chance to shoot targets on land and water as they fly through the sky on a helicopter.

'It's like the ultimate video game,' Dan Claassen from the company told WFAA.

Customers pay $795 for the game and use as many as 500 rounds as they navigate the course.

But neighbors do not consider it quite so enjoyable - and have captured cell phone footage of the noise of the helicopter as it hovers over the area.

'The first time they were hovering 
right over our two acres, shooting at whatever,' neighbor Michael Lauer told WFAA. 'You really
didn't know - were they shooting at me?'

He added: 'You just know, some day, one of them is going to hit the house or do something.'

But Claassen shrugged off their concerns.

'It's not like we're endangering anybody's life with our flight patterns or our techniques,' he said.

The company insists it is safe, adding that the helicopter is the quietest that has been developed. They add that the helicopter only flies over the shooting range and only goes out every other week.

'It's not like we're hitting this every 
day,' said Claassen. 'So it's not noise pollution.'

The company details the course on its website.

Worry: Neighbor Michael Lauer said that at first he thought the gunfire was going to hit him

'As you depart in the helicopter with your safety officer, you will be flown through and around various target opportunities,' it explains.

'Targets will fall away, rotate and even explode when hit - be prepared for any and everything! Your score will depend on your ability to adapt to air assault challenges.'

Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and Denton County said the practice is legal.

The neighbors said they may take the issue to court.
