An Iraq war veteran who lost both his legs in an IED attack missed out on a $2,000 prize at his university's football game.

Crowds of students at New Mexico State University were surprised when the winner of a cash prize was announced last Saturday, but failed to come forward.

But, although friends texted Matthew Zajac to tell him of his good fortune, the double amputee says he wouldn't have been able to get to the game because he was caring for his elderly grandmother.

Although he admits it would have been nice to win the cash, Mr Zajac has remained upbeat, telling ABC News: 'I’m sure there are people that need it more than I do.'

The cash prize was part of a university scheme to encourage more students to support their football team, the Aggies.

But, to be in with a chance of winning, students had to be at the whole game when their name was drawn.

'There is no way I would’ve 
been able to make it to the game anyway. I was taking care of my 
grandmother, who is 87,' Mr Zajac, a mechanical engineering student, said.

'There’s always stuff to do around the house, and I got to make sure she 
gets her medicine and that I get it to her on time,' he added.

The 26-year-old student has been the main carer for his grandmother, Marjorie Seedorf, since his father died last year. 

The Iraq War veteran had his right leg amputated above the knee and left leg amputated below the knee after his Humvee hit an IED in Baghdad in May 2007.

'I do a little bit of walking, and I can usually muscle through it though,' Mr Zajac said.

'He cooks for me, he shops for me and he takes me to the doctor,' his grandmother told the Albuquerque Journal. 'I appreciate everything he does.'

Last Saturday's game against San Diego State University was the first time students were offered cash prizes for attending the game.

All the students' names were entered into the draw, not just those there on the day, KRQE reported.

The university's athletics director, David McCollum, said the football team would continue to offer incentives to fans, and confirmed that Mr Zajac would not be eligible to collect the prize under the competition's rules.

He added: 'We are delighted this program gave us 
an opportunity to learn more about one of our students ... We are considering 
ways to recognize [Mr Zajac] and his service to our country.'

Despite the prize fund going uncollected, Mr Zajac has a positive outlook, saying any day he 'doesn't get blown up is a good day'.
