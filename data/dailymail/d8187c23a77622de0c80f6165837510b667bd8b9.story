A 90-year-old D-Day veteran has become the oldest person ever to be jailed in the UK.

Albert Barrow, a former lance corporal, sexually abused two young victims over many years, a court heard.

After being arrested he told a probation officer he did not believe what he had done was serious, and said: 'It happens all the time.'

Southampton Crown Court heard how his actions 'ruined' the lives of the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

A picture of his Second World War medals was held up in court as Barrow's barrister pleaded with the judge not to send him to prison.

But the judge ignored the plea and jailed Barrow, from Totton, Hampshire, for four years.

After hearing the sentence the father turned to a dock officer and said: 'But I won't be alive all that long.'

The historical offences were revealed after police were called to an incident between him and one of his victims earlier this year.

Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, said the defendant abused the victims on a regular basis.

One victim said in a statement: 'I was scared. I did not like it, I did not want it and I wanted it to stop.'

'He has ruined my life and for the past years I have had to live with this... It does not stop and it has ruined my relationships with men.'

In total, Barrow admitted 14 charges of indecent assault, which covered multiple offences. Initially, he had only admitted six charges.

Defence barrister John Lofthouse asked his client be spared prison. He said when Barrow was asked by police why he committed the offences, he told them: 'I don't know. I was abused as a child myself by my mother.'

Following his arrest, Barrow attended a police station voluntarily for an interview and said: 'I'm guilty.'

Mr Lofthouse said this belied a man who wanted to 'get things off his chest', was 'frank' and sorry for what he had done.

However, the judge pointed out there were 'concerning things' that Barrow had told probation officers in a pre-sentence report.

Judge Nicholas Rowland said: 'There are some unappealing sentiments expressed by this defendant about one of his victims.

'At one point it is reported that he [Barrow] remarks that he doesn't see it [indecent assault] as a serious matter as it "goes on all the time".'

Mr Lofthouse agreed what was said was 'appalling' and said his client was an 'ill-tuned bell' who was 'stuffy in his attitudes'.

But he insisted his client was remorseful and suggested that since committing the offences Barrow had had 'the sword of Damocles' hanging over his head.

The court heard Mr Lofthouse had submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Ministry of Justice asking how many people aged 90 or over were in prison in the UK. This revealed there were just five.

He added Barrow had a war record and held up pictures of all the medals he had won to the court.

Judge Rowland ignored Mr Lofthouse's pleas, noting that had the defendant been caught at the time of his offending and admitted the charges he would have faced at least 14 years behind bars.

Judge Rowland added: 'The effect on your victims has been immense.

'In their impact statements they have written of the long-term consequences for them - there were all sorts of problems that manifested from the abuse that you perpetuated.'

Upon hearing his sentence, Barrow, who had walked into court with the aid of a walking frame, appeared stunned.

As dock officers came to lead him away to the cells, Barrow asked them to confirm how long he had got in prison and one of them told him 'four years'.

He replied: 'But I won't be alive all that long.'

In 2010, wheelchair-bound Thomas Burton, 88, became the previous oldest person to be jailed in the UK after he admitted abusing two sisters.

Burton, from Middleton, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was jailed for 16 months for molesting the sisters more than 40 years ago.
