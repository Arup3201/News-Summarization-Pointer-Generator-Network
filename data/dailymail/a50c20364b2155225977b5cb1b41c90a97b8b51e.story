Finally found: The body of Derek Allen, pictured aged 20, has been discovered in an unmarked grave 71 years after his death

He took to the skies above northern France as the Nazi Blitzkrieg was unleashed across Europe.

It was May 10, 1940, and at the controls of his Hurricane aircraft, young Flying Officer Derek Allen’s brief but heroic war had begun.

Eight days later, the 22-year-old Second World War fighter pilot was dead.

But in his short blaze of glory, the RAF ace was awarded a gallantry medal, shot down twice and credited with four outright and three shared enemy kills.

He died after his plane was shot down over farmland, but because his body was never officially recovered, he was listed as missing in action, presumed dead, for seven decades until historian Andy Saunders began researching his case.

He discovered the young pilot had been removed from his wrecked plane on May 18 by locals and buried in the village of Poix-du-Nord, near Cambrai.

Now his younger brother Richard Allen is preparing to lead family members at a dedication service later this year when a new headstone with FO Allen’s name on it will replace an anonymous one erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

Mr Allen, an 81-year-old retired stockbroker from Great Shefford, near Hungerford, Berkshire, said yesterday: ‘It is a great relief to know what did happen to Derek and where he ended up after all these years.

‘We are grateful to Andy for finding this out and it means an awful lot that the family have at last a grave to visit so we can pay our respects.’

FO Allen, one of three brothers from Leicester, signed up with the RAF in 1937, aged 18, and joined No 85 Squadron a year later.

At the outbreak of war, the squadron 
moved to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and the 
young airman’s first action came on May 10, 1940, as Germany launched 
its Blitzkrieg across France and the Low Countries.

During his first airborne skirmish, 
he shot down a Henschel reconnaissance plane and was credited with 
playing a part in bringing down a Junkers 88 warplane.

The next day he shared two kills – 
both Dornier bombers – and on May 13 he single-handedly shot down two of
 the Luftwaffe’s Heinkel fighters.

He was posthumously awarded the 
Distinguished Flying Cross for bringing down a Junkers 87 dive bomber on
 May 15 that had been wreaking havoc on British armour during the Battle
 of France, which was to lead to the Dunkirk evacuation later that 
month.

In the same action, FO Allen’s Hurricane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, forcing him to bail out.

His citation for the DFC read: ‘After
 his aircraft had been severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire he didn’t 
hesitate to attack a Junkers 87 over enemy territory and shot it down.’

After spending 24 hours walking 
through enemy territory to get back to his base, the exhausted airman 
was spotted falling asleep while sitting eating his dinner.

On May 17 he took off for the final time and his war ended when he was shot down and killed.

With France being overrun by the Germans, local records detailing the discovery of his body were not meticulously maintained.

It was only after historian Mr 
Saunders began his investigation five years ago that he found a witness 
account of a Hurricane crashing near Cambrai on the same day FO Allen 
went missing.

With the approval of the French 
authorities and the Allen family, he began excavating the crash site and
 found parts from the downed Hurricane. He presented his findings to the
 RAF Air Historical Branch, which, after delving into FO Allen’s old 
records, was able to confirm it was his body in a grave three miles from
 the excavation site.

Mr Saunders, of Hastings, East 
Sussex, who wrote a book entitled Finding the Fallen about his research, said: ‘The Ministry of Defence had the information for 70 years 
but it had just been overlooked.

‘You have to remember there were 40,000 RAF casualties who were unaccounted for by the end of the war.

‘A lot of cases were left pending and Derek Allen’s was one of those.

‘It was just after we did our examination that they pulled out his file and there was this information all along.

‘Had he survived, going at the pace 
he did, Derek Allen would have become one of the leading fighter aces of
 the Second World War.

‘He would have been up there with Douglas Bader and Robert Stanford Tuck, yet history records record him as an unknown airman.’
