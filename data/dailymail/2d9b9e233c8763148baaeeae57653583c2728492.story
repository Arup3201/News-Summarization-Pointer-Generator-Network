Thibaut Courtois expects to keep his place in the Chelsea team for the Capital One Cup final but admits he has never been involved in a competitive penalty shoot-out.

It adds another dimension to a familiar selection dilemma for Jose Mourinho, who could opt for Petr Cech at Wembley, the hero of the 2012 Champions League final when he saved three Bayern Munich penalties.

The Chelsea manager could even send on Cech as a penalty expert if Sunday’s final against Tottenham is heading for spot-kicks, as his mentor Louis van Gaal did with Holland keeper Tim Krul in the World Cup.

The Belgium keeper displaced long-serving keeper Petr Cech last summer after returning from Atletico loan

21.4 - Petr Cech’s penalty-saving percentage in the PL and Europe — six of 28. Courtois’ record is one in eight, 12.5%

‘We will be prepared if it’s going to penalties,’ said Courtois. ‘We all work with the goalkeeper coach and do our thing in practice. I’ve only been in one shoot-out, in a friendly tournament with Atletico Madrid.’

Courtois arrived in London last year after spending three years on loan at Atletico and has become Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, starting 28 games this season to Cech’s 12.

Mourinho, however, keeps them guessing. Cech was a surprise starter against Everton in the Barclays Premier League two weeks ago. He produced a splendid display but was back on the bench for the next game, away at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.

He has not conceded a goal in the Premier League since March when he was beaten by a John Terry own goal.

‘The manager makes up his mind the day before but we find out on the day of the game when he puts the team on the board,’ said Courtois.

‘I always said I came here to play. It’s the manager’s decision, but if you come back from loan, obviously you want to play as much as possible. Otherwise it’s better to keep being on loan.

‘I think Petr and I have both done well. We’ve helped the team every time we could.’

The Belgian was in goal when Chelsea conceded five at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day and was left out of the next three games, before returning to play in both legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool.
