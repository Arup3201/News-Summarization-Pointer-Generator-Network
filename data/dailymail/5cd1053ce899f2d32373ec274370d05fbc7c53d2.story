This gigantic furry fish ball chair would be ideal for keeping you warm during these cold winter's nights.

Amazingly, the design by Jason Goh from Singapore is based on the fish balls his parents make - and a scary tale his grandma used to frighten him with.

Jason, 36, who studied at the University of Glasgow, explains: 'I used to play with my food when I'm young, especially the fish balls, as my parents are both fish ball noodle sellers.

Called a 'Moyee', Jason Goh's gigantic furry fish ball chair was inspired by the fish balls his parents used to make and a scary story his gran used to tell him in order to stop him playing with the food on his plate

His gran used to tell him in her Teochew dialect: 'If you keep playing, the fish balls will turn into a big hairy monster and eat you up.' 'That spiked my wild childhood imagination,' Mr Goh said

Called a 'Moyee', it is equipped with a 
glowing LED mood lamp, which Jason says will help the user 'sit 
comfortably in the cocoon-like space to read a book or chill out

You will need:

Â 2 pounds of fish fillets1/2 cup of water1/2 teaspoon of salt1 teaspoon of cornstarch1/2 teaspoon of sugar

1. Mince or grind fish. Place in a large bowl. Add water, salt, cornstarch and sugar. Knead by hand to blend.

2. Stir mixture firmly, in one direction only, until it takes on a fluffy consistency.

3. Lift mixture and toss it back hard against the bottom of the bowl. Repeat 15 to 20 times, or until mixture stops spattering and has an adhering quality.

4. Drop into oil heated to 375 degrees F. and fry until golden brown or boil.

'In order to stop me from doing that, 
my grandma came up with a scary fish ball monster story, which I still 
remember till these days.

'She used to tell me in Teochew dialect: 'If you keep playing, the fish balls will turn into a big hairy monster and eat you up.

'That spiked my wild childhood imagination and sent a chill down my spine.'

'The
 Gigantic Hairy Fish Ball, Moyee, is a manifestation of my imagination 
on how the fish ball monster would be in my grandma's story.'

Apart from its scary look, the monster chair can be a cozy hideout for people to sit in and relax.

Called a 'Moyee', it is equipped with a glowing LED mood lamp, which Jason says will help the user 'sit comfortably in the cocoon-like space to read a book or chill out'.

The inflatable ball has a base filled with water to prevent toppling and can be deflated to easily tuck away when it's not in use.

Fish balls are a common food in Singapore and are made minced fish and flour.

They are usually sold at food stalls similar to hot dog stands in the United States.

Fish balls are usually boiled in a spicy curry sauce or deep fried and are one of the country's most popular and representative 'street foods'.

Though the chair is not for sale, Goh's chair is currently exhibiting in the National Museum of Singapore until January 27th.
