A banner demanding that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio apologise to police in the city flew over the city on New Year's Eve.

The banner read 'De Blasio, apologize to the NYPD!!' and was flown up and down the Hudson river on Wednesday afternoon.

The message for the mayor was ordered by the son of a NYPD police officer, who said he wanted to embarrass de Blasio.

Bad run: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has been heavily criticised by the NYPD over his comments following the death of Eric Garner

Michael Sheehan, 49, a retired Westchester County correction officer whose father was a Bronx NYPD detective told the New York Daily News he paid $1,000 for the 90-minute flight. 

The banner comes just days after another reading 'De Blasio, our backs have turned to you' was flown over New York City.

It is not yet known who ordered the first banner as the advertising agency who organised it said the buyer wanted to remain anonymous.

Many NYPD cops are furious with the mayor for his sympathy toward protesters who rallied against alleged police brutality when a grand jury failed to indict an officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

De Blasio's remarks, including a statement that he had talked to his biracial son about the possibility he could be stopped by the NYPD, seemed to confirm long-held NYPD suspicions that he held anti-cop views.

Dozens of cops - from the NYPD and around the country, turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for slain Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend

Harsh words: This banner was seen flying across New York City last Friday

During a speech where he called for peaceful protests following the death of Eric Garner, de Blasio said: 

'Chirlane and I have had to talk to Dante for years about the dangers that he may face – good young man, law abiding young man, never would think to do anything wrong, and yet because of the history that still hangs over us, the dangers he may face. 

'We’ve had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him.'

When two officers were gunned down on December 20 by a fanatic who claimed he was retaliating for Garner's death, the head of the largest NYPD union, Patrick Lynch, declared that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands.' 

NYPD cops turned their backs on the mayor when he visited the slain cops' families at the hospital. 

Then, at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend, dozens of officers were pictured refusing to face de Blasio when he took the podium.

Then, at NYPD academy graduation on Monday, the mayor was met by scattered boos and was heckled while he spoke.

Yesterday, it was revealed that de Blasio's lobbyists called top political allies and asked them to publicly slam the NYPD unions and cops for turning their backs on the New York mayor at a funeral for a slain officer, it has been revealed.

DNA Info quoted two lawmakers who received calls from the de Blasio's aides asking them to speak out against the NYPD for its protest.

'City Hall wanted me to blast the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association for turning their backs on him,' one politician told the news site.  

'They called up Monday, said they were calling all of us, and that it was our obligation to stand up defending the mayor.' 

The angry lawmaker said the request, made to both state legislators from New York City and city council members, was 'not really appropriate.'  

Another politician confirmed he got a call, as well, according to DNA Info. 

A City Hall spokesman tried to cast the calls to legislators in a different light - saying the mayor's aide were simply asking for 'statements of support' for the families of two slain NYPD officers.
