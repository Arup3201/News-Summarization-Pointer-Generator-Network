A council told a homeowner to sell them half his garden so they can build a bypass as it will improve his employment prospects - even though he has had the same job for 30 years.

Glen Morrison, 49, is resisting the local authority's bid to buy his land in Aberdeen, Scotland, and instead wants them to purchase his £140,000 property so he can move elsewhere.

The technician said he doesn't want to live next to a busy road when the new Third Don river crossing is completed.

Anger: Glen Morrison, 49, wants to sell the council his home in Aberdeen - but they only want to buy his garden

Development: The new bridge crossing will be built over this section of Mr Morrison's garden if it goes ahead

Aberdeen City Council are taking the case to a land tribunal - but in an attempt to get Mr Morrison to back down they wrote to him explaining the new road will improve his job opportunities.

Mr Morrison has worked as a facilities technician at Scottish Water for 30 years and
his wife Susan already works for the council.

He said: 'This letter appeared which said what this road will do for us if it went ahead and the advantages it would give people.

'It said it would create employment opportunities for us, but I’ve been with Scottish Water for 30 years and I’m more than happy there.

'I would like to know what employment it’ll give me and my family. The only job I can think of is a lollipop man. That’s what will come out of that.

'Susan works for the council with children who have learning disabilities. She’s been with the local authority for 12 years.'

The garden is subject to a compulsory 
purchase order, but when the council refused to buy the house as 
well, at the Morrison’s request, the case was sent to a land tribunal, 
due to be heard in December.

The letter Glen and Susan received, read: 'On the positive side, it is submitted that the new road and bridge will provide increased transportation links to the north, enabling employment opportunities for the owners and occupiers of the road and, because of that increased access, it is anticipated the local bus companies will increase the frequency of services to and from the city centre and to and from the north.'

Glen said the whole development is 'upsetting' and has caused him health problems.

Fury: Mr Morrison received a letter from the council which said his job prospects will be improved by the new road. However, he has held down the same role for the last 30 years

Bizarre: The council letter said the new road and bridge will offer new 'employment opportunities'

He said: 'I didn’t want the road to be built and I didn’t want to move, but unfortunately it’s going ahead.

'They’ve offered to buy a slice of my garden, but I just want to leave now.

'I don’t want the money for my garden, I want them to buy the house as well so I can afford to move elsewhere.

'The whole thing has just been really upsetting and the stress has really affected my health.'

A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said: 'This is part of a tribunal process so it would inappropriate to comment.'
