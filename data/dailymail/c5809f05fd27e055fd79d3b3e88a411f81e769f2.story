Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon.

The three minute clip shows an unfair fight that begins with a small girl in a light blue hoodie being set upon by at least four other students.

As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked.

The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence.

The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue.

Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra.

Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table.

Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off.

Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.'

One of the main protagonists in the fight is left stripped to her bra, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench

A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. 

NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn’t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News.

Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 

'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said.

Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.
