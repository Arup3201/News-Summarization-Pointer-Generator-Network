She's the most popular teenager you've probably never heard of. 

But with a combined Instagram and Facebook following of more than 1.4 million fans, 16-year-old Sydney girl Sarah Ellen is a veritable internet queen.

'As a kid, it was always been my dream to work in the entertainment industry, but I had never actually thought I would find myself working in the entertainment industry due to people being so interested in my lifestyle,' Ms Ellen told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It’s been so amazing, I feel really lucky and have to pinch myself sometimes.'

'I’ve used my online channels not just as a way to communicate with my followers but also as a creative outlet – a fun way to express my thoughts, my style, my quirky sense of humour, things I love,' says Ellen.

It all began three years ago when the teenager posted a quirky 30-second video 'dancing her eyebrows' to a funky beat to YouTube.

'After people saw me in that video, they became interested in who I was - my life, what else I was doing and what was next for me – so my audience on social media grew quite fast after that!' says Ellen.

'I love technology, social media and creating fun content (like most people my age do!), and it was great to have an audience to share this with. So from then on, it has been my job to grow and interact with my followers - I kept creating and posting new content everyday for my followers to see, and my following just kept growing.' 

The clip has since had over 56 million views and today, more than 215,000 people subscribe to Ellen's You Tube account to tune in to her aspirational Vlogs or video blogs about life, fashion and friendship.

Ellen's internet fame has opened up a number of modelling opportunities, including being asked to become an Ambassador of Australian fashion label Supre.

'I love technology, social media and creating fun content (like most people my age do!),' says Ellen.

But that's only the tip of her internet reign. Ellen, who says she aims to post 1-3 times a day online, has a Facebook following of 686K and growing, 91K Twitter followers and an Instagram empire of 723K.

So what is it that makes Sarah Ellen so popular? 

'I ask myself this question all the time,' she laughs. 'I like to think I am just a real teenager like most of my followers, but I try to set a really positive and happy example for people and I think that is why people are inspired by me and what I do.' 

'People seem to like what I do!': The Sydney teenager says she thinks her quirky sense of humour is one of the reasons she has ammassed so many online fans

Behind the scenes with Sarah Ellen. The 16-year-old social media queen who is studying fashion, says she is even greeted by screaming young fans when she does shopping centre appearances

Ellen, who left school last year to study fashion, won't disclose exactly how much mula her online celebrity status has earned her.

But the teenager says the biggest thing that's happened this year was being approached by Australian youth fashion label Supre to be the brand's national ambassador.

'I’ve been shopping at Supre since I was a kid, so it’s kinda surreal but very cool. I’m in all their campaigns and we’ve done lots of in-store meet and greets with my fans which was pretty incredible.'

So what's next for the young fashionista?

Ellen says she plans to re-launch her YouTube channel in the New Year, as well as a new fashion and lifestyle blog, which will be called ‘Perks of Her’.

'So watch this space!' she says. Millions will be.
