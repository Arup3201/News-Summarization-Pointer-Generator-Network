Two of the rarest turtles in the world have been washed ashore on the west coast of Britain after being swept almost 5,000 miles from its usual home in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

The juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtles, which are critically endangered, were discovered on beaches in Merseyside and Cumbria.

It is thought the dinner-plate sized reptiles had been left too weak to fight against the ocean currents by unusually cold weather in the Gulf of Mexico.

This juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtle remains in a critical condition after being found barely alive on a beach on Walney Island, off Barrow in Cumbria, 4,660 miles from its usual home in warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico

The 'cold stunned' turtles are thought to have been carried across the Atlantic Ocean by the Gulf Stream together with strong westerly winds.

There are only 30 record incidents of Kemp's Ridley turtles being stranded on Irish and British beaches in the past.

They may spend their lives swimming the world's oceans hunting jelly fish and shell fish from the sea floor, but it seems that sea turtles can suffer decompression sickness.

Scientists have diagnosed the sickness for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles. 

The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive.

In humans, it can produce many symptoms from joint pain to paralysis and death, but it is not known what animals feel.

However, it appears that turtles that surface from a deep dive too quickly can also suffer from the condition.

Those accidentally caught in fishing nets are most likely to suffer. 

Most have been washed ashore already dead, so experts say to find the two turtles alive is extremely rare.

However, one of the turtles - found on Formby Beach in Sefton, Merseyside, - has since died while the other remains alive.

Marine biologists believe there may be other turtles that have suffered the same fate and have asked the public to be vigilant.

Rod Penrose, strandings coordinator of the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, said: 'It looks like there has been a large cold standing event off the eastern seaboard of the USA.

'The sea temperatures dropped causing large numbers of Kemp's Ridley turtles to become cold stunned.

'This condition leaves the turtles in a lethargic condition unable to feed or swim against strong currents.'

Mr Penrose added that the surviving turtle will be flown back the a rescue centre in North Carolina so it can be released back into the wild.

He said: 'These are the rarest turtles in the world so even just a few individuals being lost in this way can impact the populuation.'

The turtles were swept 4,664 miles from their usual breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico by strong currents

There are an estimated 1,000-5,000 breeding females left in the world, which all next on just a single beach in Mexico.

During the 1980s their numbers were reduced to just a few hundred but a major conservation effort, including translocating eggs from Mexico to a beach in Texas, has seen their numbers increase.

The smallest of the sea turtles, they can grow to be up to 70cm (27 inches) long and weigh up to 60kg (132 lbs).

They normally feed on crabs and other crustaceans around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.

In the past most Kemp's Ridley turtles that are swept to Britain tend to have damaged flippers or are two young to fight the strong currents of the Gulf Stream. However, most have been found on beaches in South West England and Wales.

The Kemp's Ridley found in Cumbria was too weak to swim after being stunned by cold water temperatures

The rescued turtles are around the size of dinner plates and are thought to be juveniles too weak to swim against the strong ocean currents and winds that have swept across the Atlantic during the past month

The most recent turtles were found far further north and experts believe strong winds in December helped carry them there.

The first was discovered on Formby beach in Sefton, Merseyside by Rob Archer, from Ramsbottom, on Saturday 20 December while he was walking with his girlfriend.

He told the Liverpool Echo: 'At first I thought it was a crab. It seemed to be in a stupor as if there wasn't much life left in it.

'My firstt thought was to put it back in the sea, so I walked out into some deeper water and it swam away.

'I have since heard I shouldn’t have done that and I do feel bad about it.'

However, the turtle washed ashore again nearby on Monday 22 December and was taken into care by the RSPCA. It later died.

The surviving turtle is now being cared for by specialist vets at the Lake District Coast Aquarium in Maryport

The second turtle was discovered on a beach on Walney Island on Sunday 21 December and was taken to the Lake District Coast Aquarium in Maryport, where it is being cared for by specialist vets.

Experts are now warning that anyone who finds a turtle should not try to put them back into the sea.

Dr Peter Richardson, Biodiversity Programme Manager at the Marine Conservation Society said: 'We advise never to put live stranded turtles in the UK back in the sea as they will almost certainly perish.'

Emily Baxter, marine conservation officer with the North West Wildlife Trusts, added: 'It is rare for non-native turtles to be washed ashore in the North West but there have been strong westerly winds over December.

'Stray juveniles can sometimes be carried by strong currents from warmer seas and this might explain why they are so far away from home.'

Anyone who finds a stranded turtle should report it to the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme on 0800 6520333 or at www.ukstrandings.org.
