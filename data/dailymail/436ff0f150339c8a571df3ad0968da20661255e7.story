Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday the deteriorating conditions in Iraq could have 'global consequences' as terror group ISIS continues to take control in large swaths of the country.

Clinton said during an event for her new book, 'Hard Choices,' that it was important that Iraq's prime minister be presented with a set of conditions for any discussion about military support against a fast-moving Islamic insurgency.

'That's a delicate and difficult task for our government because we certainly don't want to fight their fight,' Clinton said. 'Because you'd be fighting for a dysfunctional, unrepresentative, authoritarian government and there's no reason on earth that I know of that we would ever sacrifice a single American life for that.'

The former Secretary of State and potential presidential candidate said Friday that the deteriorating condition in Iraq could have 'global consequences' while attending an event for her new book 'Hard Choices'

The potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate said the turmoil in Iraq represented a 'recipe for a horrendous conflict.'

She spoke hours after President Barack Obama said the U.S. would not be dragged into military action without political reforms by leaders in Baghdad.

Before leaving for Bismarck, North Daokta, the president held a quick press conference in which he pledged not to send ground troops back to Iraq.

Clinton, who served as Obama's top diplomat, said the request by Baghdad for help was being carefully considered by the Obama administration.

'It is a ... serious potential crisis with broad regional and even global consequences,' she said.

Obama said he is currently considering a range of other options being developed by the Pentagon.
