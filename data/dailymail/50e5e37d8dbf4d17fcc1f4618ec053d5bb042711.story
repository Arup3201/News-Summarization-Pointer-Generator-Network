Graphic images of a suspected rebel 'traitor', strung up and crucified on a road sign in a Syrian town square, have been posted online by Islamist extremists.

The man, whose T-shirt is drenched in his own drying blood, was executed after he was accused of helping government forces in a country torn in two by a brutal civil war.

Pinned to his chest is a sign bearing a cryptic message that reads: 'Cleanliness is a civilised matter that shows your ethics and love for your country.'

Crucified: The man, whose T-shirt is drenched in his own drying blood, was executed after he was accused of helping government forces

Behind the killing is the hardline Islamic group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a faction so extreme that it has been disavowed by Al Qaeda.

The group posted the shocking photograph online as a warning as to what happens to defectors in areas in Syria under ISIS control.

In the disturbing image, a child can even be seen perching on an adult's shoulders, taking a photograph of the victim with a mobile phone.

It is unclear where exactly the photograph was taken.

It comes a month after ISIS released photographs of two men who had been similarly crucified in the town of al-Raqqa.

They
 were among seven people summarily executed on charges of a grenade 
attack that was said to have killed a child and maimed a man.

ISIS took over the city of al-Raqqa after 
rebels overran it in March 2013. It was the first provincial 
capital to fall under rebel control.

ISIS (or ISIL) is a pro-Al Qaeda jihadist group that many feared was taking an iron grip over parts of Syria.

The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria.

Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists.

Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of ISIS's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership.

It holds sway in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls.

The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. Al Qaeda refuse to deal with them.

In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by ISIS fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia.

There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. ISIS also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September.

There has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham.

Tensions have been rising in recent days after it was announced yesterday that president Bashar al-Assad had won a landslide election victory with almost 90 per cent of the vote, securing him a new seven-year term.

Tens of thousands took to the streets in government-held areas even before the results were announced on Wednesday evening, waving portraits of Assad and the official Syrian flag.

But there are widespread claims of vote-rigging in a nation that remains sharply divided in bitter conflict. Critics said that many of those who voted did so more out of fear than commitment to Assad, whose family has ruled Syria with a rod of iron for four decades.

Opposition activists say the election was likely to prolong the conflict that has 
devastated their country and driven nearly half the population from 
their homes and sparked an exodus of nearly three million refugees 
abroad.

Meanwhile,
 President Barack Obama's top foreign policy advisor Susan Rice on 
Friday said Washington was providing 'lethal and non-lethal' support to 
select members of the Syrian opposition, offering more detail than usual
 on US assistance.

Top
 Obama administration officials typically declined to say exactly what 
equipment, arms or ammunition the United States is providing to moderate
 Syrian opposition forces.

But
 President Barack Obama said in a major foreign policy speech last week 
that the United States would 'ramp up' support for rebels fighting 
President Bashar al-Assad.

National
 Security Advisor Susan Rice said in an interview with CNN while she was
 traveling with Obama to D-Day 70th anniversary celebrations in Normandy
 that she was heartbroken about the carnage in Syria's civil war.

'That's
 why the United States has ramped up its support for the moderate vetted
 opposition, providing lethal and non-lethal support where we can to 
support both the civilian opposition and the military opposition.'

Officials normally publicly refuse to comment on exactly what they are doing to train opposition groups.

National
 Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden declined to say whether 
Rice was announcing a new US policy by apparently being more open on US 
assistance.

'We're
 not in a position to detail all of our assistance, but as we've made 
clear, we provide both military and non-military assistance to the 
opposition,' Hayden said.

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's top foreign policy advisor said Washington was providing 'lethal and non-lethal' support to select members of the Syrian opposition fighting president Assad (right)

Signs of a deepening commitment to Syrian rebels come three weeks after Obama met the head of the opposition National Coalition, Ahmad Jarba in Washington last month.

Officially, US support for rebel fighters in Syria has been limited to non-lethal aid amounting to $287 million, though the CIA reportedly participates in a secret programme to train moderate rebels in Jordan.

Opposition leaders are particularly dismayed that the United States has balked at providing anti-aircraft missiles to rebels, fearing they could fall into the wrong hands.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that Obama is ready to sign off on training missions for selected rebel groups, to counter the rising power of Al-Qaeda-linked extremists.
