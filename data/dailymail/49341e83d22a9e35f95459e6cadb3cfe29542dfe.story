The British Basketball League is taking legal advice after Basketball England announced that its operating licence was under review and could be offered for tender.

Basketball England, which oversees the running of professional leagues in this country, on Tuesday announced the formation of a licence review committee which will consider all options, including a tender process and negotiations with the BBL in order 'to see the sport reach its full potential here'.

Their statement said: 'Our singular objective is to see the licence awarded to the organisation with a deliverable plan most likely to take the sport to the next level.'

But the announcement came as a surprise to the BBL, which said it was given no prior notification.

In their own statement, released on Wednesday, the league said: 'The BBL was not advised of this release in advance. The BBL also does not believe the process set out by Basketball England is credible, or contractually compliant, or has the options implied. BBL is disappointed it's governing body put this matter into the public domain, because of the inevitable damage to the sport.

'BBL is awaiting a response to a letter sent to Mr Hagen, the Chairman of BE on 29th December 2014. BBL is taking further advice, and reserves all rights.'

Melissa Hague, Basketball England's compliance manager, said she was satisfied everything had been handled properly by the governing body.

Former Great Britain women's coach Mark Clark and Jeff Jones, coach and co-founder of the BBL's Manchester Giants, will sit on the licence review committee, with further members to be announced in due course.

The announcement leaves the future of the BBL and its 13 franchises in limbo, with its current licence due to expire in August.

The BBL has operated in its current franchise-based form since 1987.
