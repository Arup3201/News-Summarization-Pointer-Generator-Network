A murder trial had to be suspended because a member of the jury 'became ill' when gory images of the victim were shown as evidence.

Roxanne Buck, 45, has been charged with the murder of her housemate, Michelle Johnson, 21, and tampering with evidence.

The Burger King worker is accused of repeatedly stabbing and cutting Miss Johnson, 21, in her basement room, and then trying to clear away evidence.

Miss Johnson's body was found on March 15, a few days after her mother, Dianna, who lived in the upstairs part of the Stow home, Ohio, with her, had last heard from her.

On the opening day of testimony on Tuesday, police officer Jason Bailey said he found blood spatter in the basement of the defendant, near the foot of her bed.

Outside, through a short pathway from an attached garage, the police officer said he found Miss Johnson partly covered by an old tire and blankets in an open storage shed behind the duplex.

At the trial yesterday, Summit County Medical Examiner Lisa Kohler said Miss Johnson died from gaping wounds to the neck caused by a sharp instrument. 

Minutes into her testimony, a juror in the front row became ill as a series of gory autopsy photos were being shown and asked to be excused. 

Common Pleas Judge Mary Margaret Rowlands allowed the juror to leave the courtroom.

After a half-hour recess, the woman returned and the trial resumed.

Diane Johnson told the jury she had her last contact with her daughter a day earlier — through a Facebook posting about a hearty breakfast she had made.

'She was my best friend. She was my baby,' she said. 

Miss Johnson also testified that Buck was behind on their 50-50 rent agreement. Then, she said, she found out Buck twice used drugs at the duplex.

'I told her that if I ever caught her doing it again, I'd have to kick her out, because Michelle and I didn't tolerate drugs,' she told the jury.

Defence attorney Scott Rilley said later that he asked for a mistrial in the judge's chambers, arguing that the autopsy photos had unduly prejudiced the jury. His motion was denied.

In his opening statement, Rilley said police had 'no direct evidence' that Buck committed murder.

'Did she do morally questionable things? Yes,' Rilley said, referring to the charge that Buck in some way altered the crime scene. 'But did she kill Michelle Johnson? She did not.'

Rilley said that Stow police conducted a 'minimal investigation' and quickly focused on Buck as the chief suspect.

He told the jury, however, that a Stow police officer was involved in a relationship with Michelle Johnson at the time of her death and had parked his cruiser outside the duplex for two hours on the morning of March 13, some 26 to 28 hours before Johnson disappeared.

Rilley said the department's Internal Affairs division interviewed the officer twice about the relationship. 

Soon after he was set to be questioned a third time — about a timeline for his actions — he resigned from the department, on April 8.

Buck's trial is expected to last into next week.
