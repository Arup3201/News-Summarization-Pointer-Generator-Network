A Chinese property tycoon is working as a street cleaner – because she wants to teach her children the virtue of hard work.

Millionaire Yu Youzhen, 53, owns 17 flats and has become wealthy on the back of the Chinese property boom.

But instead of pampering herself with her wealth and enjoying lazy days at the salon, spa or shopping, she instead insists on getting up at dawn six days a week to sweep, scrub and empty bins along a two mile stretch of busy road in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

'I want to be a role model for my son and daughter. I don’t want to sit around idly and eat away my fortune,' said Yu.

She said she didn’t want to give her children the impression that being a rich landlady and living off proceeds from her enviable portfolio was an easy way of life.

'That lifestyle would only harm them in the long run,' Yu added.

Her sweeping plan seems to have paid off.

Both of her children are wage-earners with her son earning a salary of £200 per month as a driver and her daughter earning £300 a month in an unspecified job, according to Chinese newspaper reports.

Yu earns a measly monthly salary of £130 from her less than glamorous employer - the Wuchang District Urban Management Bureau.

Rags to riches: The former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market

'I am not a cultured person but I always feel I need to be doing something,' Yu said, who took the job a decade ago after finding her wealthy lifestyle boring.

The rags to riches former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market.

But when Communist China stated to reform its economy in the 1980s and allowed peasants to start businesses, Yu and her husband saved enough money to construct three five-story village houses,  which they leased out for rent.

They have been successfully playing China’s booming property game ever since and expanded their property empire to 21 properties.

They have sold four flats, the proceeds from which  - plus the monthly, multiple rental income  - now provide for a luxury lifestyle should the novelty of handling a broom and an honest day’s work ever wear off.
