Gareth Barry insists he has not given up hope of an England recall despite not playing for his country for more than two years.

The midfielder has just signed a new three-year contract at Everton despite being 33 and believes age should be no barrier for club or country.

Barry has earned 53 caps since making his international debut in 2000 and was a scapegoat for England’s miserable showing at the World Cup in South Africa.

But after watching England crash out of the World Cup in Brazil, he said: 'You watch England’s games and still want to be playing, singing the national anthem.

'It’s a massive buzz. As a kid, you always dream of playing for England. Thats’s why I am still here; I’ve not been capped for a couple of years, but I’ve not retired.

'You sort of hope for that chance to come again. Any player who feels they still have a chance of playing for England and thinks maybe they should have been picked will watch the games and feel exactly the same.'

Everton have ended up paying £2million to Manchester City for Barry as part of their initial loan agreement but on last season's showing it is money well spent.

And he is looking to build on a promising start. Barry said: 'In terms of a whole campaign, last season has to be one of my best. The performances the team put out, the club record points total in the Premier League, the big wins - there were so many positives.

'But that is last season. Now we try to improve on that, and if we do improve then we are going to be going to some very good places.

International ambitions: Barry says he still want s to play for England despite not making the World Cup squad

'We will have to treat this season with respect. It is going to be very different with the Europa League and there are a lot more games. But I'm sure the manager will have his plans for that challenge already and I'm looking forward to it.

'The whole squad is always so keen to learn and never satisfied. From the manager, right through the coaching staff, to the players, everybody wants to improve.'

Manager Roberto Martinez believes Barry will continue to influence the younger players in his squad, such as Ross Barkley and John Stones, giving them invaluable guidance.

Barry added: 'It's good to be in the dressing room alongside so much young talent. While they are young, they are ready now and that is fantastic. There is a lot of experience here already and if I can add something to that, it is great.'
