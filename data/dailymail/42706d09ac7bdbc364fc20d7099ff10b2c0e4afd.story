US rapper Jay-Z has agreed to pay half the royalties of one of his songs to a Swiss jazz musician Bruno Spoerri after using his music without consent.

The rapper had denied copying instrumental 'Lilith — on the way'  in his 2013 song 'Versus'.

But he has now agreed to pay 50 per cent of the royalties to the Swiss pianist and saxophonist, following an 18-month legal wrangle.

Royalties: Swiss jazz musician Bruno Spoerri has been awarded 50 per cent of royalties from Jay-Zs song 'Versus' after rapper admitted using music without permission

It comes just days after Marvin Gaye's family were awarded $7.4 million after a jury decided that the Robin Thicke song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off Gaye's 1977 hit 'Got to Give It Up'.

The song made a staggering $16million for producer Pharrell Williams, Thicke and rapper T.I. with the family being awarded $4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song.

An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favour of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. 

In this case, the lifted melody came from a song composed by Spoerri in 1978, with the musician rejecting an initial offer as 'too low'.

The American musician and record producer only admitted using the music without attribution a few months ago, according to reports.

Speaking last year, the veteran jazz musician said legal proceedings could have been avoided with a phone call.

'In a way I'm flattered that a relatively young rapper takes a sample from an old man, a sample that is about 35 years old,' he told swissinfo.ch.

'On the other hand I'm furious because it would have been so simple to clear the sample. All it would have needed was a call or an email to the company and I think it would have been relatively cheap.'

Mr Spoerri, 79, has worked with the likes of Lee Konitz, Hans Kennel and George Gruntz in a career spanning nearly 50 years.

In an illustrious career, he has directed the Zurich jazz festival and music schools in Zurich and Lucerne.
